They then walked to a board and removed their location tags to indicate that they were no longer underground at approximately 5:59 a.m. AEST before embracing family and friends and making their way to the waiting ambulances. The vehicles slowly made their way through the crowds with a police escort and the miners waved to the crowds through the open rear doors. They will undergo medical supervision at Launceston Hospital for a period of time before being confirmed well enough to return home.\nThe last stages of the rescue, cutting the final sections of the escape tunnel had proceeded very slowly because very hard rock was encountered and work had to proceed gently to minimize the chances of further rock collapses.\nThe escape tunnel was completed at 4:47 a.m. AEST and it took another hour for the men to be transported to the surface via a \"crib room\" at \"Level 375\" (375 metres underground) where they were medically examined and were also able to shower.\nA bell at Beaconsfield's Uniting Church pealed just after 5 a.m. AEST to celebrate the rescue, and an air raid siren was sounded. This was the first time the church bell had been rung since the end of World War II. A local fire engine drove through Beaconsfield's streets sounding the siren to wake residents for the good news.\nA funeral will be held later today for a third miner, Larry Knight, who was killed in the collapse that trapped the miners on April 26.\nSources.\n&lt;br&gt;"}

Mr Justice Anthony Mann agreed with Apple Computer's defence that, while the iTunes Music Store is branded, the music it sells is not - \"I conclude that the use of the Apple logo ... does not suggest a relevant connection with the creative work.\" During the case Apple Corps showed the court just how many times the Apple Computer logo appeared during a typical download.

The company, Aggregate Industries NE Inc. was paid US$105 million for the concrete.\nAggregate said in a statement Thursday that it would cooperate with authorities.\n\"As a result of extensive testing by industry experts, Aggregate Industries is satisfied that all of the concrete it has supplied on the Big Dig and throughout the commonwealth is structurally sound,\" the statement said.\nMassachusetts Attorney General Tom Reilly said \"We have no evidence whatsoever that the structural integrity and safety of the tunnel has been compromised.\"\nCommonwealth of Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney said in a prepared statement, \"No one in Massachusetts should be surprised to learn that a project so badly mismanaged, over budget, and grossly delayed is now also facing allegations of criminal misbehavior.\" Romney and Lt. Governor Kerry Healey have also announced that they have decided to return campaign contributions from workers of Aggregate Industries.\nIndicted were: former general manager Robert Prosperi, 63, of Lynnfield, Massachusetts; Marc Blais, 36, of Lynn, Massachusetts, a dispatch manager; John Farrar, 42, of Canterbury, Connecticut, a dispatch manager; Gerard McNally, 53, of Rockland, Massachusetts, a quality control manager; Gregory Stevenson, 53, of Furlong, Pennsylvania, district operations manager; and Keith Thomas, 50, of Billerica, Massachusetts, a dispatch manager. Stevenson and Farrar are no longer with the company.

Stephen Delinsky, an attorney for one of the defendants, said they delivered quality concrete, but prosecutors probing the troubled project are looking to place blame. \"It's always easy to blame the lowest level, which is the concrete manufacturers. Each defendant believed that they acted in good faith. They believed at all times their conduct was legal and believed the concrete delivered to the Big Dig was appropriate.\"\nA spokesman for project manager Bechtel/Parsons Brinckerhoff declined comment.\nOn August 11, 2005, it was announced that the Massachusetts State Police searched Aggregate's offices in June and found evidence of faked records that hid the poor quality of concrete delivered for highway project. On March 19, 2006, the International Herald Tribune reported that Massachusetts \"Attorney General Tom Reilly plans to sue Bechtel/Parsons Brinckerhoff and other companies if the two sides do not reach an agreement over 200 complaints of poor work in the construction of a highway system under the center of Boston, the Boston Globe reported Saturday. Reilly was said to be seeking $67 million from Bechtel and $41 million from other companies.\" \nThe purpose of the project was to remove the more than 50-year-old aboveground Interstate 93 freeway running through downtown Boston by burying it, and connecting the Massachusetts Turnpike with Logan Airport by running a third tunnel below Boston Harbor. The project was completed this year after serious delays and cost overruns reached US$14.6 billion, a more than 500% increase over the original estimate of US$2.6 billion.

Valenzuela has passed the math portion of the exam, but not the part on English, which she speaks as a second language.\nGonzalez contends the test is unfair, particularly to English learners, because students who have failed the test repeatedly are more likely to attend overcrowded schools with less-qualified teachers.\nJudge Freedman said he was persuaded by that argument, but wanted to give the state a chance to change his opinion.\nHe asked lawyers on both sides to come prepared to talk about how conditions in the schools can be equalized.\nGonzalez urged seniors who still need to pass the test to keep going to classes and studying. \"It is absolutely critical for students to understand that even if the order is made final, only those students who passed their classes will get a diploma,\" he said.

A fire soon spread throughout the depot and some of the surrounding area, sending huge plumes of smoke into the air, and the fire took several days to be extinguished.\nThe HSE report, the third progress report into the disaster, explains with 'reasonable confidence' that Tank 912 in bund A of the site started receiving unleaded motor fuel from 7 p.m. UTC on December 10, 2005. By 5:20 a.m. the next day, the tank had started to overflow, spilling through air vents at the top of the tank and down the outside. Vapour from the fuel started to form from 5:38 a.m., and by 5:46 a.m. was 2 metres deep, flowing in all directions. The first explosion took place at 6:01 a.m.\nControl systems measuring the levels within the tank should have prevented overspilling. A 'servo level gauge' should have sent data back to the control room, but this gave an unchanged reading from 3 a.m., despite the levels continuing to rise. Additionally, a second, float-based safety cut-out should have stopped the inward flow once the 'ultimate high level' was reached, but this too appears to have failed.\nIt is not known for certain what caused the spark that led to the first explosion. Any evidence is likely to have been destroyed in the fire, and so the exact cause may never be known.\nThe HSE report did not place any blame, for fear of jeapodising future court cases. Some, including MP for the Hemel Hempstead Mike Penning, have called for a full public inquiry. Many local residents were forced to leave their homes after suffering damage to their houses from the explosion.\nThe explosion and fire, whilst being one of the biggest health and safety disasters in Britain, did not cause any deaths."}

Ashley Bloomfield, Chief Advisor on Public Health, says written warnings aren't as effective as pictures, and that many smokers do not know most of the diseases that smoking can cause.\nIf the proposal were adopted, the Ministry would dictate the size and placement of the images to the tobacco companies, but would not subsidise the cost of the changes."}

In fact, had that happened he probably would have been tried, served his sentence and have been released by now.\" Speaking after the trial, District Judge Nicholas Evans said, \"I readily accept, if convicted in the US, the probable sentence is likely to be appreciably harsher in the US than, in comparable circumstances, it would be in the UK. It must be obvious to any defendant that if you choose to commit a crime in a foreign country, you run the risk of being prosecuted in that country.\"\nJudge Evans reported that the US government has made promises that McKinnon will be tried in a civil court, rather than facing a military hearing. Despite these assurances McKinnon still fears what could happen to him, \"as one person has said to me, most people in Guantanamo have not been proved to be terrorists but allegedly I directly attacked the military.\"\nMs. Todner indicated that they intend to appeal against this initial ruling. \"We're proposing to appeal this to the Secretary of State, and if we're still refused we will then appeal to the High Court for a decision to allow Gary to be tried here as a British citizen.\" This seems unlikely to be successful, however, as Struan Robertson, a computing law expert, explains, \"the only way out of it is if he faces the death penalty or if he can prove extradition is politically motivated, which he hasn't done. The fact that he may get 70 years in the US is irrelevant. The treaty makes an exception for capital punishment, but facing a harsh sentence is not in itself grounds to block extradition.\""}

Freedman said he would issue an injunction against the high-stakes test, which was taken Tuesday by thousands of seniors in danger of not being graduated unless they pass, unless the state's attorneys came up with an otherwise convincing argument by 2 p.m.\nInstead, Freedman said he would wait until Friday to issue his decision.\nThe San Francisco law firm Morrison &amp; Foerster filed the lawsuit on behalf of Richmond High School senior Liliana Valenzuela and others. It contends that the test violates the \u201cequal protection\u201d concept of the law in that poor students and English-language learners don't have access to equal education.\nThe ruling would affect about 47,000 California high school seniors, and dozens at James Logan High School, who have yet to pass the exam and would be barred from being graduated if they don't.\nThirty-two James Logan students were scheduled to take the second half of the two-day test Wednesday, along with thousands of others throughout the state.\nLast week, state Superintendent of Schools Jack O'Connell said that about 47,000 California high school seniors still needed to pass the test or face the prospect of completing four years of schoolwork without receiving a diploma. O'Connell wrote the law requiring the test while serving in the state legislature.\nThe statistics O'Donnell cited also show that, while nearly 90 percent of seniors have passed the test, only 71 percent of seniors who are English learners have passed, and 83 percent of those classified as low-income have passed.\nOf the 50 taking the first part of the test at Logan High on Tuesday, only 13 were native English speakers.\nCynthia O'Brien, who is coordinating the administration of the exit exam at James Logan, said she'd like some certainty about whether the test is going to be required or not.\n\u201cThe politicals in STATE and our judicial system need to get together and do the right job by the students. If the Exit Exam is going to go forward, then it needs to go forward. If not, then it needs to be cancelled completely,\u201d she said after a long day of testing Tuesday.\n\u201cIt is not fair to the students to work their hearts out and agonize over something that has such a large impact on them and then find they didn't need to work so hard. I know there are probably students who have not taken the exam seriously, but the vast majority of Logan students have. They deserve better than to not know from one day to the next what they need to do to be granted a diploma. Most of our students who are taking the exam this go around have given up electives, lunches or time after school to prepare for the test,\u201d she said.\n\"I am afraid that the message we are giving our students is that you don't need to care,\u201d O'Brien continued, \u201cThen, one day, the system will pull the rope tight, and students will be caught not having what they need. Yes, they should all be doing their best, but when the system cries WOLF too often, people tend to ignore the message.\u201d\nO'Donnell, in a statement released on Monday, said he would try to make sure the test counts.\n\"Recognizing that today's ruling is not final, I intend to do everything in my power to ensure that at the end of the legal day we maintain the integrity of the high school exit exam, and that all graduates in the class of 2006 will enter college or the workforce with a diploma that reflects their mastery of critical academic skills,\u201d he said.\n\u201cIndependent research shows that because of the High School Exit Exam, students are working harder and learning more, and those who are struggling are getting the help they need to succeed,\u201d he said.\nCalifornia Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger said, \"Delaying the exam's implementation does a disservice to our children by depriving us of the best tool we have to make sure schools are performing as they should be. We must increase our efforts to help all students meet the minimal bar set by the exam, not lower our standards or expectations of them.\u201d\n\"I am disappointed in the Court's tentative ruling to stop implementation of the California High School Exit Exam this year but I remain hopeful this will not be their final word,\u201d he said.\nIf Freedman grants the injunction, the state's lawyers say they'll appeal.\nWhatever happens with Valenzuela vs. California, the battle isn't over. Next week, Freedman is scheduled to hear arguments in another suit that seeks to block the test. Lawyers for Public Advocates claim the department failed to hold until December a public hearing to consider alternatives to the test, six years after the Legislature approved it."}

They caused extensive damage to the passenger lounges and the bars, while they responded to the crew\u2019s pleas with cursing. A Greek police officer was injured in the leg by a flare, and a crewmember was also injured. \nThe owner of the ship, Dane Sea Line of Piraeus, estimates the cost of damage to the ship at \u20ac150,000. \nThe Greek media has accused the administration of Greek police and the Ministers of Public Order and Shipping of negligence in not doing more to prevent the events."}

At least 10 houses near the scene had to be evacuated. The dynamite was then removed without incident.\nAt about 11:00 a.m. PDT today an individual passing by the fire department called 9-1-1 to report suspicious packages left in front of the department.\n\"There's still more missing, and we want the person who left the packages to come forward.

The Chagossians (also known as Ilois) had previously won another High Court battle in 2000 which paved the way for their return, but this was overturned by Foreign Secretary Jack Straw using an Order-in-Council, a little-used piece of legislation involving the Royal Perogative. Yesterday, the high court judges ruled that the use of this action was \"irrational and unlawful\". The government has 28 days to decide whether to appeal. \nOf about 4,000 exiles from the Chagos islands, most live in poverty within the poor areas of Mauritius. All the exiles have British citizenship, with about 250 living in the UK. The case won in the High Court yesterday was brought by Chagossian community leader Olivier Bancoult, who has been fighting for the right of exiles to return to the islands for many years.\nA US military base currently occupies Diego Garcia, the biggest island in the group, after having been leased the land by the British government. The base played a role in the Iraq war. Mauritius has claimed ownership of the island, but it is currently considered by the British to be part of the British Indian Ocean Territory. Under the treaty arrangements between the UK and the US, the US is allowed to stop people living on the islands.\nIt remains to be seen whether, and when, the Ilois will be able to return. Lawyers for the Ilois argued that although they would not initially be able to live in Diego Garcia, they should be allowed to return to another of the 52 islands within the group (which contains over 600 islands in total).\nA spokesman for the foreign office said: \"We are disappointed with the judgement.\" They have not yet decided whether to appeal."}

Critics of the bill characterize it as going much further than any existing tribal recognition, creating a governing entity based solely on race, without the same requirements as needed for Native American tribal recognition, such as having existed predominantly as a distinct community, having exercised political influence over its members as an autonomous entity, and have continuously been identified as a tribal entity since 1900.\nSenator Daniel Akaka (D-Hawaii), the main proponent of bill S. 147 (the Native Hawaiian Government Reorganization Act) and a Native Hawaiian himself, had been giving daily speeches on the Senate floor since May 9 in support of the bill to raise awareness of it. His advocacy of the bill has led it to become known as the \"Akaka Bill.\" Opponents of the Akaka bill have made daily responses to the Senator's speeches as well.\n\"I thank our majority leader, the senior senator from Tennessee, who is working to uphold his commitment to bring this bill to the Senate floor for a debate and roll call vote,\" Akaka said after receiving the pledge from Majority Leader Bill Frist (R-Tenn.) on Friday. He also recognized his chief opponent, Senator Jon Kyl (R-Ariz.), who worked with Akaka \"to uphold his promise to allow the bill to come to the floor for a debate and roll call vote.\"\nFrist is expected to file a cloture motion after the Senate returns from its May recess. A vote on the cloture motion would occur within 48 hours of filing.\nOpponents of the bill, including Kyl, charge that the bill is a race-based privilege that the U.S. Constitution prohibits. Others, such as Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) imply that passage of the bill could have unintended consequences. In a speech on the Senate floor on Tuesday that preceded Akaka's, Alexander likened the bill to recognizing Hispanic populations descended from pre-republican Texas or giving tribal status to the Amish or Hasidic Jews, the \"Honolulu Star-Bulletin\" reported.\nAkaka believes that he has bipartisan support for his bill, with four Republican senators pledging support for it. At least six Republican senators would need to vote for the bill for it to pass, assuming that the bill receives solid support from Akaka's fellow Democrats and the chamber's one independent member who usually votes with the Democrats.\nA recent report from the U.S. Civil Rights Commission recommended that the bill be rejected. (PDF)\n\"The Commission recommends against passage of the Native Hawaiian Government Reorganization Act of 2005 (S. 147) as reported out of committee on May 16, 2005, or any other legislation that would discriminate on the basis of race or national origin and further subdivide the American people into discrete subgroups accorded varying degrees of privilege.\"\nAlthough the U.S. Civil Rights Commission redacted the findings section of their draft report before approving their final report, opponents of the Akaka bill have challenged the characterization of the findings section as being \"historically inaccurate\" by Akaka bill supporters.\nSupporters of the bill, which include the Democratic members of Hawaii's congressional delegation and Republican governor Linda Lingle, counter that Hawaii is a unique case because of its former history as an independent nation before the overthrow of the Hawaiian monarchy in 1893.\nKyl had placed a block on the bill when it was originally placed on the Senate schedule in July 2005, but has since agreed to allow the bill to come to a floor vote. The bill was later deferred indefinitely due in part to Hurricane Katrina."}

OHA officials have served them 30-day, forcible-detainer eviction notices in an effort to remove them. \nOn April 28, the first three cases out of 34 families facing eviction were headed for Alameda County Superior Court, but the court hearings have been delayed repeatedly as Judge Winifred Smith moves to consolidate all the cases.\nIn defense of some of the evictees, Oakland's Eviction Defense Center has teamed up with attorney Bob Salinas, of Sundeen Salinas &amp; Pyle, to file a demurrer seeking dismissal of evictions on behalf of the first three families that were served forcible-detainer\neviction notices. Lockwood Gardens has 372 units; and it is part of a revitalization project of East Oakland's public housing properties, and a partial recipient of $26,510,020 in grant funding from the Hope Vl program administered by the Department of Housing and Urban Development.\nThe revitalization funds were divided between three public housing projects in 1994 and 1996, and renovations have since taken place to demolish and rebuild the three locations into modern housing units in Oakland's eastside neighborhoods. \nLaura Lane, an attorney with the East Bay Community Law Center, is also representing a number of the families facing eviction at Lockwood Gardens and those cases will head to court at a later date. \nCurrently, out of the 34 families facing eviction, the Eviction Defense Center (EDC) is representing nine families in court, and the East Bay Community Law Center (EBCLC) is representing 12 families. One family has already been frightened into moving away from\ntheir public housing unit by the OHA; no one seems to know if the remaining seven families facing eviction have moved away or are seeking legal representation elsewhere. \nJennifer Bell of Goldfarb and Lipman is the General Counsel for the Oakland Housing Authority, and is leading the charge in court to evict the 34 families from their housing units in East Oakland.\nDuring an April 24th interview with David Lipsetz, a Senior Policy Analyst with the Oakland Housing Authority, he blamed the tenants for what is occurring and accused all the families of committing fraud to move into public housing. At first, 29 families faced\neviction, although that number has slowly risen to 34 as new families are served with eviction notices. \n\"The OHA has served eviction notices to 29 families at Lockwood Gardens because none of the families applied for, or got onto the waiting list to move into their public housing units,\" said Lipsetc. \"The tenants worked with a former clerk to gain access to the\nunits. The OHA does not have any files on the families, and the OHA does not believe that any of the families signed a lease before moving into those units. Forcible detainers are standard procedure for those that have illegally moved into the OHA's public housing units.\"\nLipsetz said that the OHA just recently discovered that the 29 families who are now living in those housing units did not match the names of the clients on the OHA list waiting to move into those units. \n\"As far as we can tell,\" said Lipsetz, \"there were no signed leases, no files established for these families, no security deposits have been paid before moving in, and those families got ahead of all the other families on the waiting list to move in.\"\nContrary to what Lipsetz stated on behalf of the Oakland Housing Authority, the facts reveal that the families have all signed Leases, Tenant Agreements To Maintain A Drug-Free Environment, Occupant's Responsibility statements, Lease Compliance forms and\na host of other documents before moving in otheir public housing units. Those documents were all counter-signed by a host of clerks and managers working for the OHA. The soon-to-be-evicted tenants' Billing Summaries, Tenant Leases and Notices have a host of names on them, such as Kim Boyd, an OHA Supervisor; Donald McShane, an OHA Manager; and Alice Ferguson, another OHA Manager. \nIn addition, as important as it may be that low-income tenants should not jump in line ahead of one another to move into this much-needed subsidized housing, most housing authorities across the nation recently have said the hell with their waiting lists, and allowed Hurricane Katrina's victims to jump in ahead of all of those already waiting in line for housing.\nA web page called \"HUD's Public Housing Program\" has a section titled \"WHEN WILL I BE NOTIFIED?\" HUD's website states: \"If the HA determines that you are eligible, your name will be put on a waiting list, unless the HA is able to assist you immediately.\" The\nweb page may be found at http://www.hud.gov/renting/phprog.cfm\nAfter discovering that the families facing eviction did indeed sign leases and other documents before moving into Lockwood Gardens, suddenly no one at the OHA would go on record to comment about the signed documents that contradicted the accusations of OHA spokesman David Lipsetz.\nThe documents clearly reveal that the 34 families facing eviction at Lockwood Gardens have all beenchecked out, and qualified as being eligible to move into those units, regardless of what the OHA may say at this point.\nThe entire controversy appears to have been triggered by acts of deception and fraud on the part of an official of the Oakland Housing Authority, Carolyn Wilson. \"The police have been looking for Carolyn Wilson of the Oakland Housing Authority ever since she\ndisappeared recently,\" said Ms. Kelly, a resident of Lockwood Gardens who prefers to use only her last name for this story. \n\"I moved into Lockwood Gardens on October 27, and Carolyn Wilson's name is on my lease,\" said Kelly. \"I first received a message from the OHA at my mother's home, telling me that a unit was available at Lockwood Gardens, and I went to their office location on 65th\nAvenue to fill out the necessary forms to move in. I supplied birth certificates, photo IDs, Social Security numbers, income statements and everything else asked of me to qualify for moving in. There's no way that I committed fraud by following through with\neverything being asked of me by the Housing Authority.\"\nKelley said she and her young child were disturbed by an unexpected, late-night arrival of OHA police at her door.\n\"I am a 41-year-old woman with an 11-year-old child, and I am very frightened by the way the OHA has been treating me,\" she said. \"I was terrified recently when the OHA Police showed up at my door around 10 p.m. at night, accusing my family of committing fraud to move into this townhouse; and they served me a five-day notice to surrender my home to the OHA, or else.\"\nOfficer Jerold Coates, a 13-year employee of the OHA Police Department, and Officer Malcolm Williams are involved in the investigation taking place at Lockwood Gardens. According to Ms. Kelly, \"Officer Coates told me that Carolyn Wilson was demanding that everyone must pay her $500 to $1,000 to move in, and he wanted to know how much I paid her before moving in. I denied paying\nMs. Wilson anything extra to move into Lockwood Gardens.\" \nKelly added, \"From what I am being told by others is that Carolyn Wilson of the OHA skipped town with everyone's security deposits of $500 to $1,000 for each family involved in the scam, and that the OHA will not receive a subsidy from HUD for the families\nfacing eviction in those units, because the OHA believes that the wrong families are residing in those housing units.\"\nOne of the families that moved into Lockwood Gardens, and is now facing eviction, moved away from another public housing location in Oakland in order to move into the Hope Vl project on 65th Avenue. It takes permission to move from one location to another in public housing, and managers or staff at the OHA had to give their blessings before this family was allowed to relocate to Lockwood Gardens. \nJorge Aguilar, an attorney for the Eviction Defense Center, has his own understanding of what is going on. \"An agent of the Oakland Housing Authority defrauded nearly 30 families of the most vulnerable segment of the community,\" he said. \"They are now trying to cover their wrongful act by evicting those families. The OHA is trying to circumvent Measure EE [Oakland's Just Cause for eviction measure]. The irony is that the OHA is using forcible detainers to evict, which have traditionally been used to defend tenants from\nlandlords using self-help evictions.\"\nAguilar recently witnessed the human suffering already caused by the OHA's eviction threats and rough handling of the families involved. He said, \"During a recent interview with one of the families facing eviction, a little boy started crying and stated that\nthe police came by and tried to take my bedroom away from me.\"\nAnother Lockwood Gardens tenant named Winou Wakeyo said, \"I'm from Jimma, Ethiopa, and I moved into Lockwood Gardens on November 22, 2005. I work 12 hours a day on Sundays for a pastor who told me to come here to find housing, and I did everything the Housing\nAuthority asked of me before moving in. A big policeman came by recently late at night with a five-day notice telling me that I must surrender my home to the Housing Authority. There were two policemen. It scared me very much, and someone later told me to find a defender to save my housing, and I contacted the Eviction Defense Center for help.\n\"I do not understand the customs of this country, and I asked my defender what I did wrong, and I was told that someone stole some money. The Housing Authority stopped accepting my rent for April, and about two weeks ago, they suddenly sent back the rent that I\npaid for March, and I do not understand why they are doing this to me.\" \nLaura Lane, an attorney for the EBCLC, said, \"The Oakland Housing Authority seems to be in a complete disarray. The management has failed to adequately screen, train or supervise its employees. But when the employees make mistakes or fail to follow the law, the\nOakland Housing Authority's response is to blame the tenants, blame the attorneys, blame the federal government -- blame anyone but the Oakland Housing Authority. There is an utter failure to accept personal responsibility.\"\nAfter it became apparent that many families were seeking legal help to fight the evictions, a meeting was held on March 20 at the East Bay Community Law Center for the victims of the housing scam. When the tenants started sharing what had occurred to them,\nmost of the families involved suddenly realized that Carolyn Wilson of the OHA had stolen their security deposits, and skipped out of town. \nTenants at Lockwood Gardens believe that there may be another 40 families or more to face eviction, since they learned that OHA police are also investigating other public housing properties in Oakland that may be caught up in the housing scam. \nAs recently as April 22, OHA police were back at Lockwood Gardens pounding on the tenants' doors, and demanding to know if the families have moved yet. \n\"This time the police were not satisfied to know if my family had moved yet,\" said Kelly, \"but they wanted to know if any of us noticed any other families moving out of here lately. Considering the way they have been treating us, I don't think we have to tell them anything at this point, and they need to talk to my attorney if they have any further questions.\" "}

Once the fuel had been used, it would be returned to the country where it originated.\nMr Howard accused the media of misunderstanding Australia's role in the Uranium industry. He told reporters that Australia is simply a Uranium supplier and that it does not convert Uranium into nuclear fuel. Mr Howard believes that the US plan is to create a group of Uranium processing nations that will take radioactive waste once it has been used.\n\"The question of waste disposal of course is an issue for those who process uranium and develop nuclear fuel, rather than the supplier of the uranium - which if Australia were to remain as a bare exporter would be the situation obtaining in relation to us\" said Mr Howard.\nAccording to Mr Howard, the purpose of the plan is to stop the proliferation of countries that have the capacity to process nuclear fuel. \nMr Howard said that Australia would continue to sell Uranium to other parts of the world, subject to its own safeguards. For a country to purchase Uranium from Australia they must enter into a nuclear safeguards agreement, prohibiting Australian Uranium from being used in weapons and must be a signatory to the UN's Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.

However, the Internet censorship is not just on Baidupedia because it's due to the keyword filtering technology on the Great Firewall of China.\nOne of the first people to find this filtering technology was Shi-Min Fang, a biochemist with a stance against ethical lapses in China. Fang, whose site \"\u65b0\u8a9e\u7d72\" has been blocked by the PRC government for years, had found that his Chinese name cannot be searched since last August if someone outside China uses an Internet search engine that is based in China. He posted a message to his own forum. A forum visitor gave him a method to verify what he found. By randomly choosing a website URL that is in China and adding banned keywords to that URL, the server connection will be reset without displaying the normal \"page does not exist\" error message. Take http://www.163.com/\u516d\u56db for example, if you use that URL to link to the site when you are outside China, you will find the server connection will be reset.\nA Chinese Wikinews reporter, , also performed this test.

And Taiwanese testers , Alex S.H. Lin and American tester roc found they will get the \"server connection has been reset\" error message when they tried to search those political keywords on Chinese search engines other than Google.\nFrom the test the testers believe that the keyword filtering technology on the Great Firewall of China is bi-directional. People outside China cannot visit any Chinese websites that have political keywords, and people in China cannot visit any websites outside China that has political keywords.\nBaidupeida that went online this April is a service that provided by the Chinese Internet search company, Baidu, and its form is very similar to Wikipedia, which is blocked by the PRC government since last year.

Originally she was to have moved to the USA in May of 2007. In national paliament she will be replaced by Amsterdam government member Laetitia Griffith starting June 1.\nThe direct reason for Hirsi Ali's departure, is that Minister for Immigration and Integration and fellow party-member, Rita Verdonk has announced that Hirsi Ali never obtained Dutch citizenship, because she lied in her application for refugee status in the Netherlands. She claimed to be a refugee directly from war-torn Somalia and to have only narrowly escaped the threat of forced marriage. In fact, she had held a refugee status in Kenya at the time. She changed her name and date of birth. \nThese facts, which Hirsi Ali previously divulged, were reported last Thursday (11 May 2006) by the Dutch television program \"Zembla\". She had already informed the public of these aspects of the story of her immigration to the Netherlands as early as September 2002 in an interview in the political magazine HP/De Tijd.\nMedia speculations arose that she could lose her Dutch Citizenship because of this 'identity fraud', rendering her ineligible for Parliament. In a first reaction Minister Rita Verdonk said she would not look into the matter, but after Member of Parliament Hilbrand Nawijn insisted, she declared that she would investigate Hirsi Ali's naturalisation process. This investigation took three days. The findings were that Hirsi Ali never received Dutch citizenship after all, because she lied about her name and date of birth. She pretended to be Ayaan Hirsi Ali, born in 1967, but official records say Ayaan Hirsi Magan, born in 1969. Therefore Verdonk's position was that Hirsi Ali never received Dutch citizenship. After accusation by \nPrime Minister Jan Peter Balkenende she works too much on her own and lacks team spirit she said to have no doubt Ayaan will be returned citizenship of the Kingdom of the Netherlands.\nOn May 16, Hirsi Ali resigned from Parliament after admitting lying on her asylum application. Hirsi Ali has announced that she will move to the United States in September 2006. There she will work on finishing her book \"Shortcut to Enlightenment\" and working for the conservative think tank American Enterprise Institute. In a reaction, former VVD-leader Hans Wiegel stated that her departure \"would not be a loss to the VVD and not be a loss to the Tweede Kamer\". Wiegel said that Hirsi Ali was a brave woman, but that her points of view were polarizing. Former parliamentary leader of the VVD, Jozias van Aartsen, was more positive about Hirsi Ali, saying that it is \"painful for Dutch society and politics that she is leaving the Tweede Kamer\".\nAyaan Hirsi Ali has been a member of parliament for the liberal Dutch People's Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD) and is known for her controversial positions on the relationship between women and islam.\nThe events surrounding Ayaan Hirsi Ali has had considerable effects on Dutch politics:"}

When this lawsuit was filed, I promised that I would fight up and down the state until the funding owed to our schools was restored,\" O'Connell, the state superintendent of Public Instruction, said in a statement last week. \"I also promised I would give the Governor credit for doing the right thing if he restored this critical funding. Today, I want to thank Governor Schwarzenegger for working with the education community to invest wisely in our schools \u2014 the best investment we can make in California\u2019s future.\"\n\"This is a good thing for our schools and community colleges throughout California,\" said Barbara E. Kerr, president of the California Teachers Association, one of the parties to the lawsuit. \u201cHaving all the money owed to our schools under Proposition 98 and the governor\u2019s agreement of 2004 restored to our students is the news we\u2019ve been waiting for.\nIn a statement regarding the settlement, Schwarzenegger said, \"I am pleased to announce a resolution that will put the dispute regarding Proposition 98 funding behind us and allow us to invest an additional $3 billion in schools in a way that best helps our students.\u201d\nProposition 98 is an amendment to the state Constitution, passed in 1988, that established a minimum funding level or guarantee for K-12 education and community colleges. O\u2019Connell and the California Teachers Association sued Schwarzenegger and the director for the California Department of Finance last summer after when they diverted billions of dollars earmarked for the schools under Prop. 98 to overcome budget deficits that were crippling California, violating an agreement made with educators the previous year.\nThe agreement restores funding Proposition 98 funding that was due, but not provided in the 2004-05 and 2005-06 fiscal years. The Governor\u2019s May Budget Revision will include $2 billion and language that provides an additional $3 billion to be paid in installments between fiscal year 2006-07 and fiscal year 2013-14, or until paid in full.\nIn addition to the settlement funds, Schwarzenegger\u2019s \u201cMay Budget Revision,\u201d announced last week, also directs billions more of the state\u2019s money to schools. Schwarzenegger said bulging state coffers, filled by unexpected tax revenues, allowed him to budget an extra 8.1 billion for schools, for a total of $55.1 billion-an over 17% overall funding increase from 2004-2005.\nThe settlement and the new budget figures \u201cwill allow us to make good on the debts to schools created through the recent lean years and to make important new investments in public education,\u201d said O\u2019Connell.\nSchwarzenegger had some ideas about how the money should be spent. \"For K-12 schools, I propose that we concentrate these funds to improve instruction in schools with low academic achievement. We should direct the funds to the classroom level for such things as lowering class size, attracting and supporting quality school leadership and fully credentialed and experienced teachers, supporting greater involvement of parents, providing more counselors in high schools, and increasing quality professional development, instructional materials, improved instruction and accountability.\u201d he said.\nAlthough pleased by the outcome of the lawsuit, Jaurequi was cautious about predicting its effect in New Haven \u201c It is significant to note that two-thirds of the new funding is one-time in nature and is not an ongoing revenue stream,\u201d she said.\n\"Although the budget process is far from over and we will likely differ on some of his budget priorities, I am happy to thank Governor Schwarzenegger for working with the education community to invest in public education,\u201d said O\u2019Connell, who\u2019s been embroiled in controversy and litigation over the California High School Exit Exam in recent weeks.\n\"I am particularly pleased to see that the Governor has increased funding to expand remediation programs for students who are struggling to pass the California High School Exit Exam, and to pay for new summer and evening administrations of the Exam,\u201d said O\u2019Connell, who wrote the law requiring the exam when he was a state legislator in 1998, \u201c I also applaud the increase in funding to expand and improve student nutrition programs giving more students the opportunity to make healthier food choices on campus. In addition, I am very happy to see additional funding for high school counselors. Our state currently has the lowest ratio of counselors to students in the nation. This is a statistic we need to improve upon\"."}

The Archbishop of Washington is traditionally a Cardinal, so there is the possibility that Wuerl will soon be elevated to Cardinal status."}

{"id": "40981", "revid": "39076", "url": "https://en.wikinews.org/wiki?curid=40981", "title": "Culture of violence reported in central Australian Aboriginal communities", "text": "Australian media reports that a recently leaked Northern Territory police briefing paper exposes \"shocking\" cases of sexual abuse and violence against women and children in remote Australian Aboriginal communities.\nCentral Australian Crown prosecutor, Dr Nannette Rogers, alleged a range of \"dreadful\" cases she has heard of. Her paper claims details of abuse (over a 15-year period), including the rape of a seven-month-old baby, and the sexual assault and drowning of a girl by an 18-year-old man. The report refers to a disturbingly abusive and secretive Indigenous male culture. She says a \"web of kinship\" has helped to create a \"conspiracy of silence\" and that Aboriginal communities were suffering from \"tragedy fatigue,\" allowing horrific crimes to appear unremarkable. \n\"It doesn't augur well for Aboriginal people to be functional human beings with the attributes of turning around and caring for children themselves,\" she said. \"The child grows up seeing violence done to him or her and having violence done to him or her.\" \nTangentyere Council chief executive William Tilmouth says it is appalling behaviour. \"It's a behaviour that's got to stop, it's behaviour that denigrates the family, as well as the women,\" he said. \nAlcohol, Law and Order.\nSenior Indigenous elder Margaret Kemarre said, \"There are more violence and there's no respect for people around here, no respect for elders and no respect for parents, as we see it now, and it's, you know, it's getting more and more,\" she said. \"I think the grog (alcohol) is really taking away all our families. It's really destroying us.\" Ms Kemarre says the answer to the problem apart from reducing the amount of alcohol in central Australia, is tougher sentencing by the white justice system.\nJane Lloyd, from Ngaanyatjarra Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara Women's Council, said more police are necessary to help restore law and order in remote communities, particularly the remote outstations. \"There is a history and tradition of violence, especially in Western Desert cultures. It's become more extreme,\" Ms Lloyd said.\nAustralia's Federal Indigenous Affairs Minister Mal Brough, says there are indeed problems with policing. \"You go into a community here in the Territory of over 2,500 people and there's not one policeman,\" he said. Mr Brough says the Federal Government has started working with the NT Government over housing and other matters, but something needs to be done urgently about alcohol.\nNorthern Territory Chief Minister, Clare Martin, says slow progress is being made. \"We are taking much stronger measures on alcohol,\" she said. \"Talking to the Aboriginal community over the last couple of months in Alice Springs, the community is very concerned about the impact of alcohol and have decided that enough is enough - that we have to stand up and take tough measures.\" She said there was no simple solution to the problems of violence, abuse, and alcoholism plaguing many indigenous communities.\nMick Gooda, of the Cooperative Research Centre for Aboriginal Tropical Health, says dysfunctional Aboriginal communities should be shut down. \"Children are at risk... they should be removed from their families,\" he said. \"We should not shy away from these hard decisions on the basis that we might be creating another stolen generation. I think what we're talking about here is kids being removed from risk situations.\" \nLyla Coorey, author of a 2005 Federal Parliamentary report on the extent of child sexual abuse in Indigenous communities, say the reasons that child sexual abuse is more prevalent in Aboriginal remote communities are numerous. \"We must look at the factors that particularly make Indigenous children vulnerable to ongoing abuse, she told ABC radio. \"I think we need to look at all aspects of Indigenous children's lives. And it will become apparent that they are probably singularly the most disadvantaged group of Australians.\"\n\"You look at perhaps the social environment that they're growing up in. They're surrounded by neglect, parents who are involved in heavy substance abuse. And I think that in itself is a major issue,\" said Ms Coorey \"And I think if you attempt to examine why that is the case you will find that a number of adults, Indigenous adults, are still suffering and still reeling from their own experiences of child sexual abuse.\"\nTraditional owner Betty Pearce says, \"This is not an Aboriginal culture. Twenty years ago, ...had an Aboriginal person done that, he'd have been killed - had he raped a child.\" \nClaims of \"paedophile rings\".\nIndigenous Affairs Minister Mal Brough has alleged on ABC Television that \"pedophile rings were working behind a veil of customary law.\" Mr Brough says he does not want to steamroll the Territory government but that he will do \"whatever it takes\" to tackle the abuse of Aboriginal children.\nNT Chief Minister Clare Martin said Mr Brough had been incredibly irresponsible. \"We have no evidence of that,\" she told Southern Cross Broadcasting. \"Two weeks ago Mal Brough had quite a session with our police commissioner, didn't mention (it). He had a long session with me, didn't mention it, (then) goes on national television, can't say where it came from, and under our law it must be reported.\" If Mr Brough had evidence of pedophile rings, he had an obligation to report it, Ms Martin said.\nOpposition Leader Kim Beazley described Mr Brough's claims as libel. \"There is nothing in Aboriginal customary law that justifies abuse,\" he said. \"Aboriginal customary law regulates relations between the genders quite strictly and protects people in a situation where they are not yet physiologically adults. The argument that somehow or other these events relate to Aboriginal customary law (is) libel. They don't.\"\nThe Northern Territory Police Association says Mr Brough's comments are offensive and ignorant. \"Mr Brough claims that our members turn a blind eye to crime in Aboriginal communities,\" association president Vince Kelly said. \"That is the most ridiculous claim I have ever heard from a federal indigenous affairs minister.\" Police often did not have the evidence to arrest suspects, Mr Kelly said. \"To suggest police turn a blind eye to crime in Aboriginal communities is nothing short of insulting. To suggest our members apply the law differently in Aboriginal communities is ignorant and displays an absolute lack of understanding of the operational realities our members face in isolated Aboriginal communities, often dealing with complex tribal systems,\" he said.\nAustralian Greens Senator Bob Brown said that the focus on Aboriginal social breakdown, including rape, paedophilia and destructive drug addiction has to broaden to include white exploitation, profiteering and disdain for Aboriginal culture.\n\"We are 11 years into Mr Howard's Prime Ministry. His most memorable early contribution to this outrageous situation was to reject what he labelled 'black armband' view of history. The problem is he turned the black armband into blinkers,\" Senator Brown said. \"The Prime Minister should lift this issue to the top his personal agenda. The plight of the First Australians is a national disgrace. Australia must restore health, safety and dignity to Aboriginal Australians.\"\nSources.\n__NOEDITSECTION__"}

Local media reports that the lucrative deal, announced by the Nine Network, is believed to be the \"highest ever paid to secure news talent\". A planned TV special will be the outcome of a deal secured by Publishing and Broadcasting Limited (PBL), which owns the Nine Network. \nMiners Todd Russell and Brant Webb were entombed nearly a kilometre underground following a cave-in on April 25 at the Beaconsfield Gold Mine in Tasmania. A third miner, Larry Knight, was killed in the rock-fall. The two survivors trapped in a wire cage, survived by drinking water seeping through rocks until rescuers managed to dig a small tunnel to deliver fresh food and water. Their tale has captured the attention of the nation, with media corporations fighting for exclusive rights to the miners' story.\nThe Nine Network's chief executive Eddie McGuire said under the PBL deal, Woman's Day, the Australian Women's Weekly and the Bulletin magazines would also have access to the men. The Nine Network has announced it would broadcast a two-hour special with entitled \"The Great Escape.\"\nAnother deal is expected to be brokered with U.S. media. Mr McGuire said the deal would not restrict the pair from selling their story to CNN, the US Today Show and Good Morning America, who have all reportedly made contact with Mr Russell and Mr Webb this week. \nUnder the PBL deal, Woman's Day, the Australian Women's Weekly and the Bulletin magazines would also have access to the men, Mr McGuire said. Nine says it also wants the footage and photographs taken by the miners during their ordeal. The footage remains in the hands of the mining company.\nThe men, who were rescued on May 9, have not spoken publicly about the time they spent trapped underground. \nSee Wikipedia article: Beaconsfield mine collapse"}

Mundine, an ex-rugby league star promoted the much-anticipated fight that attracted around 40,000 spectators and a national record for a pay-per-view television event. \n\"Who's the man, who's the man?\" Mundine asked the crowd after the fight. Western Australia's Danny Green (the \"Machine\") was defeated after 12 rounds at the Sydney Football Stadium by \"the Man\" Mundine. Mundine has improved his overall record to 26 wins and three losses. His victory sets up a world title bout against Denmark's Mikkel Kessler. \nAfter the bout Mundine praised his opponent's tenacity: \"I just wanna' thank Danny for a great fight... I was starting to get loose man, Danny was starting to put a lot of pressure on me, he's got a good long jab, I had to evade that,\" said Mundine. \"I utilized my speed to catch him and it paid dividends. I was looking for the knockout, I caught him with a few great shots, [and] he can take a great punch. He put up a good performance. He come around, he come prepared - I was the better man tonight Dan, thank you very much. We can do it again maybe, soon.\" \nGreen agreed that Mundine fought the better fight. \"He just beat me fair and square. I have no excuses at all, I trained unbelievable, my preparation was great... Anthony was the better man tonight,\" said Green.\nThe WBA fight consolidated six years of taunts and hyperbole to settle a long-running feud between the men and their supporters. According to media reports the battle was personal from the outset with Mundine's mother Lyn yelling at her son from ringside to \"Knock him out Choc, shut him up my baby\". \nSports media commentators reported that the pace remained hectic in the first four rounds as Mundine stood firm and used his jab as Green mixed his trademark \"power punches.\" As the fight wore on, Mundine appeared in greater control and in better condition. However, Mundine did end up on the canvas in the seventh round, after being pushed through the ropes by Green. \nThroughout the fight, Green's power punches \"missed, missed and missed again\". In the final \"ferocious\" round, Mundine rocked Green with a combination to the head, taunting Green to \"Come on.\" Green attempted plenty of combinations, but Mundine's speed caused problems. After 12 rounds, Judge Pinit Prayadsab from Thailand gave the fight to Mundine 118-11, South Korean Michael Lee scored it 116-113 and Australian Derek Milham had it 118-112.\nAustralian newspapers report that the appreciative crowd included corporate CEOs, former world heavyweight champion Joe Frazier, bikie gangs, peroxide blondes and rugby league players. Referee Terry O'Connor described the event as a fight Australia can be proud of. \"They both gave their all, it was a great fight.\" He described the atmosphere at Aussie Stadium as \"fantastic\" \"It was the greatest fight I have refereed, it was brilliant,\" O'Connor said. \nThe \"Man v Machine\" event fight, promoted by Mundine's Boxa International and the \"Green Machine\" promoters is believed to have beeen the \"biggest boxing match in Australian history\", grossing an estimated $20 million. Each boxer is reported to be earning a seven-figure sum, while spectators have paid up to A$1000 for a seat at the bout. Foxtel reported record sales for their exclusive pay-per-view event, claiming that subscriptions outsold the Lennox Lewis v Mike Tyson heavyweight bout. Heavy betting ensued with one punter laying a $500,000 bet on Mundine to take the honours.\nOf his upcoming bout with Denmark's Mikkel Kessler, Mundine said: \"It was a close fight last time. I think he's the best fighter out there, but I've shown I can match it with him. I'm ready.\""}

This is a remarkably fast turnaround for an appeal of a ruling that was made less than a week ago.\" \nMost appeals of a Superior Court decision go to an appellate court first. \nLast Friday, Superior Court judge Robert Freedman ruled against maintaining the California High School Exit Exam as a condition of graduation for the class of 2006, saying that the law requiring high school students to pass the test is unconstitutional because economically and racially disadvantaged students weren't offered equal educations and therefore didn't have an equal chance to pass.\nIn his statement, O'Connell acknowledged that some students need more help than others, but said the test should stand, anyway: \"We know that some students at some schools need extra attention to overcome challenges brought to the classroom and challenges within the schools they attend. We agree those students must have every option available to them to learn the skills on the exam. But I strongly disagree that the remedy for students still struggling to pass the exam is to simply hand them a diploma whether or not they have learned what they need to know.\"\nArturo J. Gonzalez, the San Francisco attorney who persuaded Freedman to stop the use of the test, told reporters that Freedman had ruled correctly and that the state should give up and let the students graduate. \"There is no basis for the Supreme Court to take diplomas away from 45,000 students who have passed all required courses,\" he said in an email exchange with the \"James Logan Courier\". \"To do that, they would have to find that Judge Freedman abused his discretion. Given the overwhelming evidence in support of his ruling, I do not think that any of the seven justices will find an abuse of discretion.\" \nCalifornia Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger said he supported O'Connell's bid to reinstate the test and would \"put the full weight of my administration behind reinstating the California High School Exit Exam graduation requirement.\"\nO'Connell, who wrote the law, wants the requirement to be enforced against this year's would-be graduates who haven't yet passed the test and so is set to ask the State Supreme Court to immediately stay Freedman's injunction to allow the state to withhold high school diplomas as originally planned. At last count, the ruling affects about 47,000 California Seniors, including about 70 from James Logan High School.\n\"The decision came as more than 1,100 California high schools prepare for graduation ceremonies,\" he said, \"It created confusion and uncertainty not only for seniors in the class of 2006 but for juniors in the class of 2007.\"\nCynthia O'Brien, who oversees testing at James Logan High School, told \"The Courier\" she wants the confusion to end. \"If the Exit Exam is going to go forward, then it needs to go forward. If not, then it needs to be cancelled completely,\" she said last week.\n\"Many students now wonder whether they should enroll in summer school or plan to take a summer administration of the exit exam,\" he said, \"Administrators and teachers are left wondering whether students who need the extra assistance will bother to enroll. And students who should be buckling down to learn the skills they need to succeed in college or the workplace have now been told they can get a diploma whether or not they have those skills.\"\n\"It is our responsibility to all of California's children, especially our disadvantaged and minority students, to equip them with the most basic skills they will need in college, in work and in life,\" said Schwarzenegger. \"Postponing the exam graduation requirement will hurt our children in the long run by depriving us of the best tool we have to measure how well schools are doing their job.\"\nHe said he's budgeted more money to help students pass the test: \"My 2006-07 budget will add $7.7 million for three additional administration of the exam and we will also provide $65 million this year to give students at risk of failing the exam the support they need to pass it.\" \nThe high court has 90 days to decide whether to hear O'Connell's appeal once it's filed, but could act more quickly if it chooses."}

After the overthrow of the monarchy and Hawaii's subsequent annexation in 1900, the government of the former kingdom was \"subordinated to the federal government,\" Lingle said, asserting that Native Hawaiians' relationship to the U.S. has been political in nature rather than purely racial. She claims that this relationship was not adequately reflected in the Civil Rights Commission's report.\nOpponents of the Akaka Bill have disputed the accuracy of Lingle's claims, as well as those of her Attorney General, Mark J. Bennett. They point out that throughout the Hawaiian Kingdom period, through the annexation of Hawaii and into statehood, no racial group in Hawaii ever had an exclusive government for their race alone, and that the Akaka Bill specifically creates a new government based on race, not on politics.\nAttached to her letter was a three-page summary written by Hawaii Attorney General Mark Bennett, outlining the state government's criticisms of the CRC's report. Bennett said that the report reflected \"a complete lack of understanding of this country's longstanding practice of dealing specially with its native peoples.\" Bennett also cited congressional precedent in legislation that compares the situation of Native Hawaiians to that of Native Americans. Bennett sums up the criticism by saying that there is \"simply no legal or moral distinction between Native Hawaiians and American Indians or Alaska Natives, that would justify denying Native Hawaiians the same treatment other Native American groups in this country currently enjoy.\"\nAccording to the Civil Rights Commission's report, a panel of experts briefed the commission on January 20, 2006; and public comment was solicited until March 21, 2006. The Commission noted that most of the comments received were in opposition to the legislation, and that while the supporters \"took great pains to analogize the situation of Native Hawaiians with those of Native Americans,\" many of the opponents argued, \"in very personal terms, that the proposed legislation would be inconsistent with basic American principles of equality, traditional Hawaiian values, and their own personal ethics.\"\nIn the end, the Commission recommended against passage of S. 147 as reported out of committee or any similar bill that \"would discriminate on the basis of race or national origin and further subdivide the American people into discrete subgroups accorded varying degrees of privilege.\"\nTwo of the seven commission members reportedly rejected the conclusion and are expected to file formal dissents.\nFrist had pledged to file a motion before the Senate to bring the measure to a vote when the body returns from May recess. Should 60 of the 100 senators approve the cloture motion, a vote would occur after a maximum of 30 hours of debate. The bill, if approved by the Senate, would still need to pass the House by the end of the year."}

As you are now getting close to version 1.0 of OpenSync, which is expected to become the new synchronisation framework for KDE and other free desktops, we are quite interested in the merits it can provide for KDE users and for developers, as well as for the Open Source Community as a whole. So there's one key-question before I move deeper into the details of OpenSync:\nWhat does OpenSync accomplish, that no one did before?\nCornelius:\nHow do the end-users profit from using synching solutions that interface with OpenSync as framework?\nCornelius:\nHow does OpenSync help developers with coding?\nCornelius:\nTobias:\nWhy should producers of portable devices get involved with your team?\nCornelius:\nDo you also plan to support applications of OpenSync in proprietary systems like OSX and Windows?\nCornelius:\nWhat does your synchronisation framework do for KDE and for KitchenSync in particular?\nCornelius:\nWho, How and Why?\nWhat was your personal reason for getting involved with OpenSync?\nCornelius:\nArmin:\nTobias:\nCan you tell us a bit about your further plans and ideas?\nCornelius:\nArmin:\nTobias:\nWhat was the most dire problem you had to face when creating OpenSync and how did you face it?\nCornelius:\nArmin:\nWhat was the greatest moment for you?\nCornelius:\nArmin:\nTobias:\nAs we now know the worst problem you faced and your greatest moment, the only one missing is: What was your weirdest experience while working on OpenSync?\nCornelius:\nTobias:\nDevices and Programs.\nNow I'd like to move on to some more specific questions about current and planned abilities of OpenSync. As first, I've got a personal one:\nI have an old iPod sitting around here. Can I or will I be able to use a program utilizing OpenSync to synchronize my calendars, contacts and music to it?\nCornelius:\nArmin:\nWhich other devices do you already support?\nCornelius:\nWhich programs already implement OpenSync and where can we check back to find new additions?\nCornelius:\nArmin:\nTechnical Dive.\nIt is time to give the developers something to devour, too. I'll keep this as a short twice-fold technical dive before coming to the takeoff question, even though I'm sure there's information for a double-volume book on technical subleties.\nAs first dive: How did you integrate OpenSync in KitchenSync, viewed from the coding side?\nCornelius:\nAnd for the second, deeper dive:\nCan you give us a quick outline of those inner workings of OpenSync, from the developers view, which make OpenSync especially viable for application in several different desktop environments?\nCornelius:\nArmin:\nTakeoff.\nTo add some more spice for those of our readers, whose interest you just managed to spawn (or to skyrocket), please tell us where they can get more information on the OpenSync Framework, how they can best meet and help you and how they can help improving sync-support for KDE by helping OpenSync.\nCornelius:\nArmin:\nMany thanks for your time!\nCornelius:\nArmin:\nTobias:\nFurther Information on OpenSync can be found on the OpenSync Website: www.opensync.org\nThis Interview was done by Arne Babenhauserheide in April 2006 via e-mail and KOffice on behalf of himself, the OpenSource Community, SpreadKDE.org and the Dot (dot.kde.org).\nIt was first published on the Dot and is licensed under the cc-attribution-sharealike-license.\nA pdf-version with pictures can be found at opensync-interview.pdf (OpenDocument version: opensync-interview.odt)"}

He made amends seven minutes though when he converted a Waratahs penalty.\nLome Fa'atau went over the line for the Hurricanes on the half-hour mark to put them up 13-8 and this is what the scoreline looked like going into half-time.\nThe second half began with the Hurricanes failing to take the lead they deserved and it was the Waratahs who started off the second half scoring when, in the 64th minute, the Hurricanes conceded a penalty that was converted by Hewat. This was followed by another penalty five minutes later that Hewat again dealt to putting the Waratah's up 14-13.\nAfter the Waratahs were penalised from their scrum in the 72nd minute, Jimmy Gopperth scored a 50-metre penalty kick to put the Hurricanes back in front, 16-14. Try as they may, the Waratahs were unable to score in the final eight minutes. \nThe final is the first final the Hurricanes have ever qualified for, having been previously been defeated in three other semi-finals. The Hurricanes also earned the right to host the semi-final, which was the first ever played in Hurricanes territory, by beating the Waratahs a week earlier in Sydney, 19-14, in the final round.\nThe Hurricanes will now meet the winners of the Crusaders vs Bulls clash that will take place tomorrow night at Jade Stadium in Christchurch, New Zealand. The Crusaders have been backed as \"unbeatable\" against the Bulls. The game was Chris Whittaker's last for the Waratahs in Super 14 rugby, after he announced his retirement earlier this year. The match was officiated by Jonathan Kaplan. It was the Waratahs 14th loss in the 15 Waratahs matches that Kaplan has been the referee."}

General Peter Chiarelli, the No. 2 ranking US general in Iraq, has made the assertion that providing jobs for the Iraqi people is key to ending the insurgency and stabilizing the country.\nIn a video teleconference with reporters at the Pentagon he said, \"by creating jobs and opportunity, the Iraqi government would take away a major source of support for violent movements -- aimless, underemployed, young men who would otherwise rather be gainfully employed and supporting their families, but are laying IEDs, shooting RPGs and fighting Iraqi security forces and the coalition because they lack alternatives\u2026. In areas where unemployment is the highest, as I go out and talk to people in those areas, and they tell me the one thing that you can do to lower the number of insurgencies is find jobs for the people. And we're committed to help both the Iraqi government and the PRTs as they go about the business of doing exactly that.\"\nThe General also said that the insurgents were taking advantage of political disputes within the Iraqi leadership as they are attempting to form an inclusive government.\nChiarelli's assertion is similar to a claim made by Lt. General John R. Vines in 2005 that insurgents often attack US forces out of a desire to earn money instead of ideology. Simple tasks, such as placing a bomb or mine, are often done in exchange for amounts as little as $100 to $150.\nThe estimated unemployment rate in Iraq for 2005 was 25-30%. \nOpponents of the Bush administration's handling of the war say that Iraq's unemployment crisis is partially a result of decisions made by the Coalition Provisional Authority in 2003 to disband the Iraqi army and purge the Iraqi civil service of high-ranking members of the Baath Party. Both of these moves led to an estimated 500,000 Iraqis losing their jobs, about one out of every ten Iraqi workers at the time."}

Another noticeable change is the design of the costumed characters that star in the series, which now have larger heads, besides many other modifications.\nCharacters in the series include original members RAGGS, Trilby, Fido, B. Max (B. Maxwell Oliver) and Razzles. New to the series is Dumpster, an opinionated cat. The stars live together in a home, and learn to develop positive relationships with each other.\nMore concerts for the show will be filmed in September 2006. Producers are inviting fans to contact them, to be notified when the open tapings happen.\nCreated by RAGGS LLC Production, the series is co-produced with Southern Star Entertainment Pty Limited. RAGGS was created by former advertising executive Toni Steedman, who now manages RAGGS LLC full-time. Beginning as a promotional company managing mall's kids clubs, RAGGS expanded to a touring show, released CDS, a DVD, and a line of merchandise. The series' creator plans to have the show on the air in the United States, within the next few months. Sixty-five episodes were produced.\nThis certainly isn't the first time a fictional band has had a television series. The Archies, Josie and the Pussycats, The Banana Splits, and Alvin and the Chipmunks are all notable examples."}

Discovery weighs approximately 4.5 million pounds.\nThe launch was supposed to occur in May, but NASA pushed back the date because of a faulty fuel sensor.\nThis will be Discovery's second mission since the space shuttle Columbia broke apart during re-entry in 2003. Engineers believed that foam falling from the shuttle and smashing into the wing caused the disaster. After the accident, NASA grounded the shuttle fleet to determine the cause.\nIn 2005 cameras had shown during launch that a piece of foam being shed from the external tank, as well as smaller tile and foam dings. NASA and the crew decided that mission specialist Stephen Robinson should attempt to pull out the protruding gap fillers. Cameras also detected a small piece of thermal blanket near the cockpit that fell off, but later tests in wind tunnels had shown the piece to be of little concern and Discover landed safely.\nNASA is scheduling the launch for Discovery to be between July 1 and July 19, 2006 and Steve Lindsey will Commander of the mission, flying with pilot Mark Kelly, two spacewalkers, Mike Fossum and Piers Sellers and mission specialists Stephanie Wilson and Lisa Nowak.

Greg Sommerville lead out the Crusaders, in honour of his 100th match for the side, while Bakkies Botha lead out the Bulls in recognition of his 50th match milestone.\nThe Bulls were on the back foot immediately after Fourie du Preez knocked on a Daniel Carter kick. The Bulls also failed to capitalize early on, with Morn\u00e9 Steyn missing a 35 m penalty kick straight in front in the 7th minute.\nThe scoring opened up in the 16th minute, with All Black flyhalf and 2005 IRB World player of the year Daniel Carter kicking a penalty for the Crusaders, as well as taking his own season tally to 200 points.\nAfter a Leon MacDonald chip kick, which he managed to regather, the Crusaders were able to produce quick ruck ball which ended with a grubber by centre Casey Laulala for winger Rico Gear to run on to and place down for the first try of the match. Carter subsequently missed the resulting conversion.\nThe Bulls' first points came in the 29th minute with Steyn kicking a 40m penalty to put three points on the board for the South African team. However, nearly straight after the kickoff, the Crusaders forced a turn over and again were able to produce quick ruck ball for Laulala to put away Gear for his second try of the night. Carter missed the conversion, which was in a similar position to the first.\nCarter was then able to lengthen the Crusaders' lead with a dropped goal 35m out. After some good mauling, Springboks' winger Bryan Habana was able to score a try for the Bulls in the corner just before the stroke of halftime. Steyn missed the conversion, leaving the score 16\u20138 in favour of the Crusaders at half time.\nIn the second half, the Crusaders scored a try through lock Chris Jack after 17 phases, most of which consisted of pick and goes. This drew the Bulls fowards in and allowed half back Andrew Ellis to pass out to Jack who scored. Carter kicked the conversion to make it 23\u20138.\nFour minutes into the second half, promising young scrum half Andrew Ellis went down with what appeared to be an injury to his right knee. He was ably replace by All Black scrum half Kevin Senio. Three minutes later, Habana went down with a leg injury. This could be potentially devastating news for Springboks coach Jake White. Reserve scrum half Senio later went off to the blood-bin, forcing Cameron McIntyre on. Carter then switched into scrum half until Senio returned for McIntyre.\nAfter the Bulls managed to control the ball for the next 20 minutes, the Crusaders forced a turn over. Fullback MacDonald was able to place a grubber into the corner, going out off a Bulls player. Some quick thinking by Aaron Mauger to throw the ball in quickly resulted in try to hooker Corey Flynn, which is his second in two weeks. Carter missed the subsequent coversion.\nMauger was again involved in the action later, this time scoring himself an impressive try in the 67th minute. After receiving a high pass from Carter, Mauger ran 51 m to score, beating 4 tacklers in the process and scoring the try in the 5th tackle. Carter converted and in doing so eclipsed Andrew Mehrten's record of 206 points in a season.\nLate in the game, Pierre Spies scored a consolation try after quick ruck ball and breaking a Senio tackle. Steyn converted. This left it a 35\u201315, the final score.\nAfter the match, Bulls captain Victor Matfield praised the Crusaders: \"They punished us like they always do\".\nThe Bulls loss continues their poor run at Jade Stadium, having won only once, back in 1996. In fact, the Crusaders have not lost at Jade since round 2, 2004. It also continued the run of New Zealand teams - no New Zealand team has lost to a South African team in a semi.\nThe Crusaders started the match as large favourites, paying $1.07 compared to the Bulls $7.00.\nThe final will be held at 7:35 p.m., Saturday, May 27 at Jade Stadium. It is the fourth all New Zealand final in 11 seasons of super rugby. It is expected to be a sell out."}

Rear Admiral Harry Harris, the commander of Joint Task Force Guantanamo says some detainees were injured in \"the most violent outbreak\" at the facility since it was opened in 2002.\nOfficers fired rubber bullets at the detainees after the guards were attacked with \"broken light fixtures, fan blades\" and other improvised weapons. Rear Admiral Harris says, \"minimum force was used to quell the disturbance\".\nThe New York Times reports that a riot-control unit with batons and shields quelled Thursday\u2019s disturbance. Another episode involved two other groups of inmates who tore apart their quarters and attacked guards.\nMilitary officials said the detainees' actions were designed to draw attention to the plight of the terror suspects detained indefinitely in \"Gitmo\". Rear Admiral Harris, said that a prisoner was pretending to hang himself to lure the guards into the room. \"The detainees had slickened the floor of their block with faeces, urine and soapy water in an attempt to trick the guards,\" he said. \"They then assaulted the guards with broken light fixtures, fan blades and bits of metal.\"\nThe guards used pepper spray and blasted the detainees with several shots from a shotgun, firing rubber balls during the five-minute fight. No guards were hurt, but six inmates were treated for \"minor injuries,\" he said.\nColonel Mike Bumgarner said guards shot five rounds of \"nonlethal\" pellets from a 12-gauge shotgun, and a rubber grenade from an M-203 launcher. He said rioting then broke out in two other blocks of Camp Four when around 50 detainees damaged their quarters and made weapons to attack the guards. Colonel Bumgarner said it took an hour to bring the disturbances under control. He says the six detainees received minor injuries.\nA military spokesman said 60 of the detainees were later transferred to more secure areas of the camp. Colonel Bumgarner says \"detainees were jumping out of the beds on top of the guards\" and some guards were knocked to the floor. \"Frankly we were losing the fight at that point,\" he said. \"This illustrates to me the dangerous nature of the men we have detained here,\" Rear Admiral Harris told reporters in a teleconference.\nEarlier in the day, two other detainees attempted suicide by overdosing on hoarded prescription drugs. Guantanamo officials said there have been 41 suicide attempts by 25 detainees and no deaths since the camp opened in January 2002. Defense lawyers contend the figure is higher.\nMeanwhile, the United Nations Committee Against Torture has called on the United States to shut down Guantanamo and close any other \"secret prisons\" it operates. The UN declared the indefinite detention of suspects without charge a \"violation of the UN Convention Against Torture.\"\n\"The State party should cease to detain any person at Guantanamo Bay and close this detention facility, permit access by the detainees to judicial process or release them as soon as possible,\" the committee said. They called on the US to \"ensure that no one is detained in any secret detention facility under its de facto effective control\"."}

Mr Howard said soaring oil prices and environmental concerns from fossil-fuel energy are adding pressure towards the debate in Australia. \"I think it is inevitable. The time at which it will come should be governed by economic considerations,\" Mr Howard said from Ottawa.\nAustralian Greens leader Senator Bob Brown labelled the Prime Minister's call \"a sham\". Senator Brown says the Prime Minister has already made up his mind. \"His talk about a public debate is a complete sham, he's made up his mind,\" he said. \"He's had no mandate, but he's got control of the Senate and therefore we are going headlong into becoming a major agent in the nuclear proliferation right around the world.\"\nScientists have said Australia could not develop a nuclear power industry in time to stave off the effects of climate change. Greenpeace Australia says that even if there was a doubling of nuclear energy by 2050 it would only reduce greenhouse gas emissions by five percent, well below the large cuts scientists say are necessary. Academics at NSW University and the University of Technology Sydney have said, \"No private investor would take on the risk without huge government subsidies.\" \nThe NSW Greens MLC Ian Cohen said that after 50 years, the nuclear industry still had not found a way to store its waste safely. \"We don't want it back and we don't want to create it here.\"\nSteve Shallhorn, chief executive of Greenpeace Australia Pacific says the Prime Minister should have used his trip to Canada to learn why \"nuclear power is not a viable option.\" Mr Shallhorn said that, in Canada, nuclear power has driven up the price of electricity and created dangerous amounts of waste. He says its effect in reducing greenhouse gas emissions is also negligible.\n\"Nuclear power can only solve a very tiny portion of greenhouse gas problems because electricity is only one source of the problem,\" said Mr Shallhorn. \"Nuclear power is not going to solve emissions from aircraft, from the industrial sector or from industrial processes.\"\n\"I think it is inevitable. The time at which it will come should be governed by economic considerations,\" Mr Howard said from Ottawa.\nAustralia is one of the world's top coal producers. The Howard government has supported the coal industry in the face of calls for more renewable energy. Treasurer Peter Costello, next-in-line for the prime minister's job, has said \"nuclear power would cost twice as much as coal power, adding that nuclear energy was not economically right for Australia at the present time because it had such large resources of gas and coal.\"\nJohn Howard said nuclear power in Australia \"could be closer than some people would have thought a short while ago.\" Federal Industry Minister, Ian Macfarlane, claimed it could be as early as 2020.\nThe Opposition's environment spokesman, Anthony Albanese, said Labor opposed nuclear power on cost, safety, and waste and proliferation grounds. \"Labor will not change that view.\" He said he looks forward to \"Labor ending John Howard's nuclear fantasy.\" Energy experts say that Australia could not develop a nuclear power industry in time to stave off the effects of climate change, and such a program would be prohibitively expensive. \nA 2005 survey found 47 percent of Australians supported nuclear power and 40 percent opposed it. The federal opposition party, and all six state governments, oppose nuclear power. Australia has a strict \"no new mines\" uranium policy."}

The official Xinhua News Agency reports the event as a \"landmark in the construction of the project.\" \nLaunched in 1993, the Three Gorges Project, including the 2,300 metre long, 185 metre high dam with 26 power generators, is being built in three phases on the middle reaches of the Yangtze River - China's longest river. Built with over 16 million m3 of concrete, the Three Gorges Dam is considered the biggest reinforced concrete dam in the world. \nThe Three Gorges Reservoir is capable of holding nearly 40 billion m3 of water, including a space of 22.15 billion m3 for extra flooded water. With a length of more than 6,300 km and a natural fall of 5,400 metres from the west to the east, the flood-prone Yangtze River is the third largest in the world.\nThe gigantic project is expected to generate around 15 million megawatts of electricity, 84.7 billion kWh annually when the entire project is completed in 2008. But whilst proponents of the world's largest hydropower project laud the increased electricity generation and improved flood control as benefits to China, opponents claim destruction of the environment, ruin to China's cultural heritage - disaffecting millions of local residents.\n\"In my view, building the Three Gorges dam is a ridiculous and evil farce,\" says dam opponent Dai Qing. \"Many people have known something is wrong with the project, but few have dared to speak up,\" she said. After it becomes operational, the 660km reservoir created by the dam will drown 13 towns, 4500 villages and 162 archaeological sites. \nFriends of the Earth (FoE) are also strident vocal critics. \"The dam is having a titanic social and environment impact,\" the group said this week. \"Sometimes people are being moved out by truncheon and bulldozer because they refuse to leave their home for fear of not being rehoused. Human rights violations are massive and brutal,\" it said. FoE pointed to evidence that the dam was already having a serious environment impact.\nFoE points to a scientific study by the East China Normal University in Shanghai, published in March in Geophysical Research, which said that in 2004, the Three Gorges dam has reduced the supply of sediment to the Yangtze delta to just 35 per cent of the norm.\nMillions of tonnes of silt are drawn along the Yangtze river every year, and critics argue the dam will intercept much of it - with potentially disastrous consequences. They say the lack of sediment further downstream would lead to soil erosion, and the accumulation of sediment in the reservoir could raise the dam level, submerging even more land. \nOpponents say the reservoir could fill with the accumulated garbage from tens of millions of households. The China Yangtze River Three Gorges Project Development Corp. has spent $2.5 million on a vessel to collect as much as 7 million cubic feet of garbage that accumulates at the dam each year, according to Xinhua. Some argue that the impact of the dam project will contribute to the extinction of the rare Yangtze river dolphin. \nThe dam project will force the relocation of a total of 1.13 million people, and communities that have lived in the area for millennia will disappear. Researchers warn sedimentation and rising water levels in the reservoir will lead to the evacuation of tens of thousands more people.\nBut as the waters rise, that which can not be saved will disappear along with some world famous natural scenery. Critics say the dam is under threat from earthquakes, with two geological fault lines nearby. Officials working on the project counter this by saying the worst that can happen is a tremor measuring 6.0 on the Richter scale, while the dam is built to withstand force 7.0.\n\"Although the dam is now complete, we still have a long way to go and cannot become self-satisfied or relax our efforts in the least,\" Li Yongan, general manager of the Three Gorges Project Development Corp, said. The official China Daily in an editorial called for people to remember the more than 100 workers whom died during the dam's construction. \"The best possible way to repay such a debt of gratitude is to make sure the highest safety and quality standards are observed up till the very end of the entire building process,\" the editorial said."}

Palestinian officials say several people were wounded in the explosion, including intelligence chief Tareq Abu Rajab.\nAbu Rajab, the head of the \"mukhabarat\" intelligence service, was among 11 people wounded at his heavily guarded headquarters in northern Gaza. He was with several bodyguards in an elevator when an explosion blasted the building. Abu Rajab's bodyguard and nephew, Ali Abu Hassira, died shortly after the blast. At least eight other people, most of them bodyguards, were wounded in what has been called an assassination attempt. \nUnidentified gunmen opened fire on the convoy of vehicles transporting Abu Rajab to hospital, causing no injuries. The explosion followed a night of armed clashes between gunmen from the rival Hamas and Fatah factions. \nPresidential spokesman Nabil Abu Rudeina condemned the blast and called for launching an immediate inquiry into the bombing. \"The assassination attempt of the head of the Palestinian intelligence services chief Tareq Abu Rajab is a serious escalation and an attempt to undermine national security,\" Abu Rudeina said. \nThe attack \"will lead to a degeneration of the situation in the Palestinian territories\" added Abu Rudeina, currently with Palestinian Authority president Abbas in the Red Sea resort of Sharm El Sheikh ahead of an international economic conference. \"President Abbas ordered an immediate investigation,\" he said. \nTawfiq Tirawi, a top security official in the West Bank who serves as Rajab's deputy, indicated at a news conference that an alternative security force of Hamas militants might be responsible. Hamas government spokesman Ghazi Hamad was cautious not to call the blast an assassination attempt, saying that \"hasty accusations\" should be avoided. \nSome Fatah members demanded that Abbas dissolve the Hamas government and call a new election. A group calling itself the Fatah Protection Unit demanded that Hamas disband its 3,000-strong militia within three days. The militia was deployed earlier this week, despite Abbas' vehement opposition. \nReuters reports that the Hamas-led Palestinian government faces international action unless the militant Islamist movement renounces violence, recognises Israel and embraces existing peace plans. \nSources.\n \n "}

NSW Finance Minister John Della Bosca denied the sale was incongruent with Labor's stance on privatisation, or that it was a pre-election strategy.\nThe New South Wales, Victorian and federal government jointly owns the hydroelectric scheme and have decided to sell their shares by floating the company on the Australian Stock Exchange.\nNSW taxpayers hold 58 per cent of the shares in the scheme and the State government stands to make between $1.5 billion and $2 billion from the sale. Selling the Snowy Hydro scheme could raise up to $3 billion for the Victorian, NSW and federal governments. \nMr Della Bosca told the ABC: \"We've looked at all sorts of arrangements to raise more capital.\" He said the sale would secure the future of Snowy Hydro. \"Snowy is at a point where it's not responsible for it to go further into debt and the best thing for it, to be able to do, is raise capital on the stock exchange.\" The Minister denied the privatisation was a \"grab for cash\".\nLiberal Senator Bill Heffernan is demanding a constitutional referendum to hand control of all rivers to the Commonwealth.

The two candidates had been neck-and-neck in the returns through the night. Early returns with 22% of precincts reporting showed Nagin leading 51% to 49%, while a later update with 48% of precincts showed Landrieu with the lead with the same margin.\nNagin first won the office in 2002, winning 76,469 votes (58.72%). Nagin, a Cable Executive, defeated New Orleans police chief, Richard Pennington, in that election by a lead of more than 22,000 votes with Pennington receiving 53,781 votes (41.29%). The total votes cast for both mayoral candidates in 2002 was 130,250 in comparison with the 113,591 total votes cast in this latest election.\nBoth Nagin and Landrieu called for the citizens of New Orleans to work together in unity. Nagin, in his victory speech, said, \"It's time for us to stop the bickering. It's time for us to stop measuring things in black and white and yellow and Asian. It's time for us to be one New Orleans.\"\nLandrieu struck a similar tone in his concession speech: \"One thing is for sure that we as a people have got to come together so we can speak with one voice and one purpose,\" he said. \"Join with me in supporting Mayor Nagin.\"\nNagin and Landrieu, both Democrats, agreed on most issues confronting New Orleans, including upholding the right of residents to rebuild in all areas of the city, and lobbying for increased recovery aid and upgraded levee protection. \nWhat differentiated the two candidates was leadership style. Nagin, a former cable executive is best known for his maverick, straight-talking, political-outsider style, and his sometimes controversial remarks to the media in the aftermath of Katrina. Landrieu, a member of a prominent political family in Louisiana, emphasized his ability to reach consensus and bring people together during the campaign.\nRace also appears to have played a factor, with Nagin winning majority black neighborhoods and Landrieu winning majority white neighborhoods. However, Nagin did also get a significant crossover vote from the more heavily populated, predominantly white neighborhoods. In 2002, both mayoral candidates, Nagin and Pennington, were black. Nagin won 100% of predominantly white precincts in that election while his opponent faired better in predominantly black precincts.\nLouisiana Secretary of State Al Ater said that turnout was comparable to the April 22 primary, when about 37 percent of eligible voters cast ballots.\nNagin's new term begins May 31, one day before the Atlantic hurricane season begins."}

Greece's singer Anna Vissi, who was one of the favourites to win, came 9th, followed by Ireland's Brian Kennedy. From the start of the song contest as well as during the televoting, the Greek organisers presented viewers choreographies and dances inspired by Greek culture and music, both ancient and modern. In addition, the world famous Greek singer Nana Moushouri was presented by the hosts and gave the sign for the start of televoting.\nWielding spark-spewing instruments, the \"Monster-themed\" rock band beat 23 other competitors, scoring 292 points from telephone voters in 38 countries with its song \"Hard Rock Hallelujah\" in a performance that both shocked and amused viewers.\nA spokesperson for Lordi said: \"We won the contest, looking like this,\u201d he said. \u201cIt just goes to show that Europe is not such a bad place.\" The Finnish band thanked viewers for voting for their song, which featured the lead singer hoisting a double-headed-axe microphone stand above his head. The win has been dubbed as a \"radical departure\" from the catchy pop tunes, folk songs and emotional ballads normally associated with Eurovision.\nComplete with distorted guitars, a catchy chorus and \"mock-demonic imagery,\" Lordi is reminiscent of 1970s American band Kiss - an inspiration acknowledged by lead singer Mr Lordi. \"What this has shown is that there are different styles of music than just pop and rock,\" Mr Lordi told news media after the surprise victory. \"That should be the goal of Eurovision,\" he said.\nMr. Lordi, whose real name is Tomi Putaansuu, hails from Lapland and says his band's masked personas are just characters. \"The guys behind the masks are not interesting - underneath, there's just a boring, normal guy who walks the dogs, goes to the supermarket, watches DVDs and eats candies. You really don't want to see him.\" he said. But the characters \"live on stage and they live in a fantasy world\", he said. \"This element of mystery is one of the cornerstones of Lordi.\" \nThe band has upset many Finns with their outrageous behaviour. \"This is a victory for rock music... and also a victory for open-mindedness,\" Mr Lordi said. \"For the millionth time, we\u2019re not Satanists or devil worshippers. This is entertainment. The masks are like our calling card and we\u2019ll never perform without them. It would be like Santa Claus handing a child his gifts at Christmas time and then pulling off his beard\u2026\"\nThe 51st annual Eurovision was broadcast live across Europe, watched by an estimated 100 million viewers. Regarded by many as the \"contest good taste forgot,\" Eurovision is adored by fans of kitsch and camp everywhere. \nLordi join the likes of Abba, Bucks Fizz, Dana and Celine Dion on the elite list of Eurovision winners.\nBecause of Lordi's first place finish, next year the 52nd Eurovision Song Contest will take place, for the first time, in Helsinki, Finland."}

Our contribution was roughly covered half by the DVD sales, and half by European Union support (http://www.uni-verse.org consortium).\nOne of the most common criticisms of CGI films is focus on technology over content. For instance, \"Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within\" flopped with audiences, in spite of being an undisputed technical milestone. I've seen many reviews that criticized the plot of \"Elephants Dream\" as too bizarre or confusing. In retrospect, are you happy with the story development process?\nHaha, I knew the story and plot would get a mixed acclaim. There's a couple of reasons I'd like to mention for it.\nFirst of all; the criticism resembles how people witness Blender itself, too. Many people expect that Free Software is an easy accessible mass audience product. We get a lot of complaints by non-artists that they can't get into the software easily, whilst the complexity of commercial products like Maya or Houdini is perceived as a confirmation of its \"quality\". Apparently an Open Movie created similar expectations with the audience.\nLuckily we also got many positive reviews of the artistic result of the movie. It is quite abstract, but definitely has many layers of information, inspiring many of the viewers to see relevant real life messages hidden here.\nFor this project we've teamed up with the Netherlands Media Art Institute, internationally renowned as a resource for video art. So for \"Elephants Dream\", we've had the luxury to challenge ourselves to create real independent artistic content as well. The artists had a lot of freedom from the start; they were responsible for the concept, story and creative development of the entire movie. This has resulted in a lot of quite personal choices, based on what the artists liked to do themselves. I really cherish such an approach, it has resulted in a very motivated team working crazy hours the last months to get it all realized.\nBut, most importantly; the main target of our project was not only to create a 3D movie short, but to experiment with ways to improve the efficiency and quality of open source development. On this aspect only, this project was just a huge success, and the main reason for our sponsors (the DVD pre-sale) to support it. I know they might have liked a cartoonish funny movie with furry animals better, but for that you get already pretty well served by the bigger 3D animation studios. :)\nI'm the first to admit that - looking back especially - certain aspects worked out quite weakly; there's loose ends and questionable decisions, \nespecially in story development and continuity. That's just the risk of doing experiments, and nothing I regret really. The five artists from our user community who were invited to make the movie were young people with no professional background in filmmaking. Their personal incentive to participate in this project was also to learn from it, and to create a good portfolio for their future career. I've witnessed them grow in competence in the past year enormously, something I'm incredibly proud of.\nOn the technical level, the only major criticism I've seen of \"Elephants Dream\" is the character animation, especially in the opening scene -- many reviewers felt that the movements seemed a bit unnatural. Do you agree with these criticisms? If so, what do you think can be done to improve on that level?\nYeah, the challenge the artists set themselves - to use quite realistic personages - is also something that easily works against you. In many \nanimation movies they introduce characters in the beginning in a way you get used to their specific characteristic movements, so you accept \na certain level of non-realism easily. (Check the weird walk cycles in \"The Incredibles\" for example). Another aspect is that we've started work on the first scenes, and ended with the last scenes. I can clearly see the animation quality increase, and that whilst the ending scenes were done in much less time due to time constraints.\nWe also didn't schedule to do 9.5 minutes of animation either\u2026. Originally it was more like 6. But, it's always easier to look back to define the right decisions, eh? :)\nI'm very happy with the reviews we got so far; luckily the movie was perceived as a professional quality product, and reviewed based on comparisons with what the big studios come up with. Even when we couldn't satisfy all these quality demands, it has luckily not been branded as a pathetic presumptuous attempt by amateurs!\nDo you think there is hope for a full-length open movie project in the near future? Would the Blender Foundation be interested in such a project, or do you intend to continue focusing mainly on shorts?\nI'd like to wait a little while with defining what a next project would look like. Given the constraints of \"organizing projects to improve \nopen source development\", we might have not much choice either. It would probably mean to work with a new team each time, so most likely \nbe based on shorts only. On the other hand, there's also clear signals that this approach works well, and creates excitement and involvement of a lot of people, also from producers and sponsors. That might enable us to set up a next project based on larger targets. For a full-length feature film however, we should involve a sufficient amount of experienced film makers as well, and/or invite the first team to participate again. That would put a lot of pressure on the required budget\u2026. You can't do that based on a 1000 DVD pre-sale target. Would more be like 20,000 or so\u2026. :)\nHow did the process of making the movie feed back into the development of Blender? Are there major technical changes that were made only or primarily because of the film?\nAlready during the pre-production phase the artists have defined the key targets for Blender development. This then was coordinated with the \nonline development community too. I've done the most crucial (re-)development mostly myself, though. Especially on the character animation tools, on the rendering pipeline and compositing tools.\nIt is especially the latter I'm most satisfied with. In 3D movie production the compositing stage creates a giant content bottleneck. By transparently integrating this in our render-pipeline, a very efficient workflow has been achieved. And, not to forget, Blender now also offers the first production-level open source compositor on the market!\nThe current summary you can find in our work-in-progress release notes.\nWhat are the key technical features in Blender you want to add or improve for future movie projects?\nDepends on what the movie is about! There's always hundreds of features you can work on. However, we'll have to work on that anyway, movie project or not. There's a lot of professionals using Blender \"now\", and they can't wait for the Blender Foundation to do movies! Look at this studio for example:\nhttp://www.plumiferos.com/\nI read that at least one proprietary software package, Reaktor, was used for the sound effects. Is this because no equivalent free software solution exists yet? Will future projects have a \"free software only\" policy?\nWe've limited the \"Open Source tools\" requirement to our own Studio Orange only. That was what we could keep in control at least, and I can tell you it was not always easy even... :)\nFor sound and music we've decided from the beginning to seek an external sponsor. We have chosen to work with the best quality studio and composer we could find, preferably using open source, but not as a prerequisite.\nMy own competence is solely within the CG [computer graphics, Ed.] side of movie making. When it comes to music editing, or video encoding and DVD authoring, I could only decide to choose to work with external parties with proven competences in that area. I have to be practical in projects like this, especially to ensure it will be realized.\nHopefully, now we've got so much attention world wide, we can involve more non-CG open source next time, too. I will definitely strive for the maximum here, but it will fully depend on the amount of professional support we can get.\nBlender itself was originally closed source freeware, until it was \"liberated\" through a fundraising campaign. If you could choose one proprietary application to \"set free\" where such a goal could be realistically achieved, which one would it be?\nWell, the \"realistically achieved\" demand makes it quite difficult. :) Looking back at similar cases, like Mozilla and OpenOffice.org, it \nwas always very circumstantial. It just happens sometimes, you can't organize something like this to happen in advance. The only common denominator is \"a company in troubles\"\u2026 so, who's in trouble now?\nWhat is your personal favorite computer-animated full-length film?\nUuuh\u2026 that differs every week! Probably \"Ice Age\" (the first one). Mostly because they didn't overdo showcasing 3D technology so much, but created truly adorable characters and great funny gags.\n "}

Mr Downer's comments follow similar comments made by Australian Prime Minister John Howard in Canada last week.\nMr Downer said that climate change has strongly influenced many to change their position on nuclear power and to encourage debate. He encouraged people to keep an open mind on nuclear power within the context of reducing greenhouse gases. The production of nuclear energy produces far fewer greenhouse gas emissions than coal and oil power stations.\nMr Downer also said that it would make sense for Australia to investigate nuclear power generation given that it has 30 to 40 percent of the world's Uranium reserves.\nMr Downer said any discussion would need to look at whether Australia would build nuclear power stations in the future and whether a Uranium enrichment program would be undertaken.\n\"There's the question of whether Australia itself would eventually, some time, no doubt in the far distant future, build nuclear power stations,\" he said.\n\"There's a question of whether Australia would ever enrich uranium - in other words, we go up the processing chain, rather than just dig it out.\" Mr Downer said.\nUnlike Australian industry minister, Ian MacFarlane and finance minister, Nick Minchin, Mr Downer refused to say when he thought nuclear energy would become a reality in Australia. Mr Downer said the construction of nuclear power plants would depend on two things - political debate and economic considerations. Mr Downer said that nuclear power plants can be very expensive to build and they would need to be comparable in overall cost to oil and coal based power plants for it to make economic sense.\nOpposition treasury spokesman Wayne Swan has said he does not support Australia building nuclear power plants. He also said that Australia had large energy reserves and has no need for nuclear power generation. \"We are a country with an abundance of energy, we're are optimistic about what can occur with clean coal technologies, we have an abundant supply of gas \u2013 I don't see the need for Australia to go down that road.\""}

Under the program, the bulk of construction costs come from private companies who own the schools for 30 years, after which time they revert to government ownership.\nThe PPP program began in October 2001. According to the government, 19 schools will be delivered under the PPP program by 2009.\nThe announcement follows Member for Bathurst, Gerard Martin's statement to parliament on September 14, 2005 that the government would be rebuilding the school at a cost of $18 to $25 million. \"The Government has accepted the responsibility of the $18 million to $25 million to rebuild the school, which is proceeding post haste\" he said.\nThe PPP announcement has been seen as a backflip by the government.\nWhen approached by Wikinews, Brad Hazzard, the opposition's education spokesperson said that the coalition did not have a formal policy in this area but generally were supportive of the PPP program so long as infrastructure and maintenance are addressed.\nAustralian Greens education spokesperson, John Kaye, said that problems were already emerging with the PPP program in NSW. In March 2006, it was revealed that the government had to negotiate an exit strategy so that after school hours child care could be provided. In a media release provided to Wikinews, Dr Kaye said, \"Yet another flaw in a NSW Public Private Partnership (PPP) has been uncovered. Just like the Cross City Tunnel, the community suffered because the contract failed to protect the quality of service delivery,\"\n\u201cAfter numerous complaints from parents, the Iemma government had to negotiate an exit strategy from the contract to provide out-of-school-hours childcare. Corporate giant ABC Learning which had purchased the original provider, Peppercorn, was clearly not interested in the expensive end of childcare\".\nDr Kaye also pointed out that an Auditor general\u2019s report found alarming evidence that the basis for PPP in NSW could be based on unreliable financial models. Dr Kaye said that the Auditor General has \"cast a very large shadow\" over the government's claimed savings from the PPP program.\n\u201cIt appears that the NSW government does not know with any degree of certainty how much it would cost to perform the same function in the public sector. Any attempt to say that private sector control is cheaper is now fraught with danger,\"\n\u201cThe Auditor General\u2019s report proves that the methodology used by the Government to estimate the costs of public sector provision is highly unreliable and suspect\" said Dr Kaye.\nBoth Carmel Tebbutt and Gerard Martin gave no response when contacted by Wikinews."}

The Australian Greens have rejected the Prime Minister's assumption that nuclear power might be 'desirable' for Australia. The Greens say they challenge Mr Howard to show \"true leadership on climate change and nuclear non-proliferation.\"\nGreens climate change and energy spokesperson Senator Christine Milne said Mr Howard was \"playing politics\" by floating the idea and testing public opinion before developing a government position.\n\"Instead of pandering to US President George Bush and UK Prime Minister Tony Blair - the two most unpopular leaders in the world today - Prime Minister Howard should demonstrate real leadership and put some authenticity into the government's response to climate change and terrorism,\" Senator Milne said. \"Nuclear power and nuclear proliferation are a threat to both.\"\nSenator Milne challenged advocates of nuclear power to explain what they will to do about nuclear waste, how large a public subsidy they are prepared to pay to prop up nuclear power, and why the Sustainable Development Commission was wrong when it recommended last month against expanding nuclear power in Britain.\n\"Australians have already had to subsidise uranium mining companies to clean up after mines have closed, while last week's Budget papers revealed that ANSTO can't estimate the cost of decommissioning the Lucas Heights nuclear reactor,\" Senator Milne said. \"When will advocates of nuclear power admit that it is too slow, too expensive and too dangerous to be a solution to climate change? Nor is there any safe way to dispose of the waste. It is not even safe to transport, a concern supported by the head of the International Energy Agency...\" said Senator Milne in a media release.\n\"Instead of turning to nuclear power, Australia should ratify the Kyoto Protocol, invest in renewable energy, adopt a national energy efficiency target and improve public transport.\n\"Several studies examining options to achieve deep cuts in Australian greenhouse emissions all show this goal can be achieved, cost effectively, without resorting to nuclear power,\" said Senator Milne in a media release.\nGreens leader Bob Brown says the Prime Minister is sending a message of approval for Indonesia to become a nuclear power. \"Australia and our region are essentially nuclear-free. Mr Howard is abandoning that security to grab uranium profits and facilitate an Australian role in nuclear enrichment,\" Senator Brown said. \"This robs Australia of its moral strength to argue against Indonesia resurrecting the Soeharto plan for 12 nuclear reactors and to advance its interest in Russian-built floating nuclear power stations.\"\n\"This will make our region much less secure for the next generation of Australians,\" Senator Brown said. \"John Howard has talked up regional terrorism. Now he is promoting nuclear power proliferation in our neighbourhood. At best his logic is faulty, at worst he is taking Australia into a future unnecessarily menaced by the nuclear threat,\" Senator Brown said. \nLabor MP Kelvin Thomson says John Howard's push towards nuclear power generation could heighten the risk of a terrorist attack. \"The problem with nuclear power is that more of it that is around, the easier it is for terrorists to get access to it and I'm not satisfied that in this day and age we can be absolutely certain that terrorists can't access it,\" Mr Thomson said. \nMr Thompson said the Government should be focussing its interest on \"much safer and environmentally-friendly\" abundant renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar power. Mr Thomson said Australia was a potential world-leader in solar power. \"Surely you exhaust all the other alternatives first before you say let's go down the nuclear road,\" he said. \n\"The problem with nuclear power is that more of it that is around, the easier it is for terrorists to get access to it,\" he said. \"I'm not satisfied that in this day and age you can be absolutely certain that terrorists can't access it.\"\nUnion leader Bill Shorten, a federal Labor candidate at the next election, believes the issue is unpopular with the electorate. A survey in 2005 found 47 percent of Australians supported nuclear power and 40 percent opposed it.\nProfessor Frank Muller from the University of New South Wales, said the framework to manage nuclear power needs to be put in place first. He says it could take decades before a nuclear power plant could operate. \"So it actually takes even longer to provide a greenhouse benefit than it does to build a power plant,\" he said. Professor Muller says nuclear power stations are expensive to build, and safety is a major issue.\nOpposition environment spokesman Anthony Albanese said: \"John Howard's nuclear fantasy is Australia's nightmare,\" Mr Albanese told reporters. \"Intractable problems with nuclear energy when it comes to economic costs, safety, disposal of waste and contribution to nuclear proliferation remain up to some 50 years.\"\nMr Albanese said that if Mr Howard was serious about nuclear power he should say where a nuclear power plant would be built, and where the waste it produced would be stored. \"If he's so confident that nuclear energy is safe... I'm sure he'll have coalition MPs volunteering to have a nuclear reactor in their electorate and to store their waste in the electorate,\" he said. \nMr Albanese said the current Labor policy remained opposed to nuclear energy in Australia."}

On May 22, Mr. Yee held a speech at Dartmouth College and told an audience of 100 he was accused of espionage and spying by the US in September 2003 and was kept in isolation for 76 days.\nMr Yee claimed in The Dartmouth, a Dartmouth College newspaper, the United States was \"accepting torture\" and that this \"damages the reputation of the U.S.\" He continued: \"We've lost that status of being the beacon of human rights because of Abu Ghraib and Guant\u00e1namo\".\nOn May 5 Mr Yee had spoken at the University of California, Davis, to the UC Davis Center for the Study of Human Rights in the Americas (CSHRA). They had hosted a forum about the treatment of prisoners at Guant\u00e1namo Bay. \nMr Yee believes journalists and congressmen who visit Guant\u00e1namo prison do not get an unsanitized picture of conditions there, and spoke at length about his personal experience there, what prisoners and interpreters told him during his time as Guant\u00e1namo chaplain, and what happened when he was imprisoned.\nIn one incident a cell door had mistakenly been left unlocked by guards, and a prisoner left his cell and attempted to lock the three guards in the cell while they were conducting a search. The guards easily overpowered the would-be escapee. \"But the incident didn't stop there,\" said Mr Yee who said this incident lead to a violent reaction from the guards.\n\"One of the guards continued to bludgeon that prisoner on the back of the head after already being shackled at the ankles and his wrists behind his back and, of course, it was a bloody affair. There was blood all over.\"\nYee also said that some prisoners were children \"the ages of some of the prisoners down there, as young as 12 to 14 years old. Prisoners as young as 12 to 14 years old were being held down in Guant\u00e1namo when I was there.\"\nJames Yee was accused of espionage by the military on September 10, 2003, and arrested while heading home from Cuba on a leave of absence. After 76 days, James Yee was released and the criminal charges against him were eventually dropped. He said he was locked away in solitary confinement and abused in a manner similar to that of the other detainees at Guantanamo.\nAbout the treatment he received when he was imprisoned, Mr Yee said he was first more worried about his family, \"I was arrested in secret, held incommunicado. I never showed up at the airport in Seattle like I was supposed to have, where my wife and daughter were waiting. They didn't know what happened to me. My parents in New Jersey had no idea what had happened. I essentially disappeared from society, from the face of the earth.\"\nMr Yee then said he was dressed up as a prisoner and subject to \"sensory deprivation\". \"And down on the way, on this trip to Charleston, the guard pulls out of this bag these goggles ... so now I can't see a thing. He takes out these heavy industrial type ear muffs ... puts them on my ears, and now I can't hear a thing. We call this tactic 'sensory deprivation.' Sensory deprivation, it's something that I recently read that the American Psychiatric Association has included in a draft of their definition of torture.\"\nTaking an ironic look at his own capture Mr Yee said: \"On another aspect of the treatment he experienced, Yee said, \"One of the most ironic parts of this situation is that down in Guantanamo, as the Muslim chaplain, I was able to protect certain religious rights for the alleged, suspected, Taliban and al-Qaeda prisoners down in Guantanamo.

Geoffrey Miller, commander of the Guant\u00e1namo detention camp, is said to have made the decision to jail Mr Yee.

Arcelor Chairman Joseph Kinsch told reporters after a meeting of Arcelor's board that the company's directors would be ready to examine the details of Mittal's latest offer once it has been approved by the CSSF (Luxembourg's financial regulatory body). \nUntil Sunday, Arcelor, the world's second-largest steel company, had firmly rejected world-leader Mittal's bid to take the former company over and form a global steel giant. The softening of Arcelor's stance comes after Mittal Steel raised its hostile cash-and-equity bid by a third on Friday and dropped a key demand for family control over the combined entity. \nMedia reports had suggested that Arcelor was trying to find another company to rescue it from being taken over by Mittal Steel. Possible candidates included Russian tycoon Vladimir Lisin and Russia's Magnitogorsk Iron &amp; Steel Works (MMK). Mittal's move on Friday came after the value of its initial offer fell more than 10 percent behind the market worth of Arcelor, as the latter announced a buyback of its own shares at above-market prices to ward off Mittal Steel.\nLaxminivas Mittal, who has hinted that the bitter takeover battle might have a hint of racism involved in it, told the French newspaper \"La Tribune\" that he was sure that the attractive nature of his revised offer would enable him to obtain over 50% of the Arcelor shares. He added that he was of the opinion that the involvement of a Russian third party would not be in the best interests of Arcelor's shareholders."}

According to Reuters, the statement is perhaps the firmest call yet from one of the two main allies in the United States-led invasion of Iraq on a date for pulling out troops. \nHe said the unity government will hasten the handover of control from coalition forces back to Iraqis, allowing Britain bring some troops home by mid-year. Britain has around 7,000 troops in Iraq. Prime Minister Maliki said overall control of security in most of Iraq's 18 provinces could gradually pass into Iraqi hands by end-2006.\nAs violence continues across Iraq with at least 11 people killed in shootings and bomb attacks, Mr Blair said it had taken \"three years of struggle\" to reach the formation of a government. \"It's been longer and harder than any of us would have wanted it to be but this is a new beginning,\" he said from Baghdad. \nThe installation of Iraq's first full-term government since 2003 has forced discussion on withdrawal plans for approximately 150,000 foreign soldiers stationed there.

Despite expectations, there were no riots that night; however, early celebrations had occurred in the capital Podgorica based off of expected results.\nThis is the first time Montenegro has been independent since 1916, when it became a part of Austro-Hungary. In 1918 Montenegro merged with Serbia. Soon Serbia, Croatia and Slovenia together formed \"Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenians\", which later changed the name into Kingdom Yugoslavia. In 1945. Yugoslavia became a communist state.

As greenhouse gas levels rose, so did the Earth's temperature,\" the scientists reported.\nDr Margaret Torn of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory said: \"It means the warming is happening faster, each decade is actually warming faster than it would have,\" Dr Torn said. \"It's the pace of change that will be one of the big problems.

Over the past 100 years, it has warmed by 0.8 degrees C, indicating a recent acceleration in warmth.

The goal must be to stop plastic bags getting into the litter stream and spoiling Australia\u2019s environment.\" \nThe Senator says the result came from entirely voluntary action \u2013 \"no regulations, no levies or additional costs to shoppers. I am delighted that the major supermarkets are committed to achieving the 50 per cent goal by the end of this year. I also share their view that development of a viable degradable bag to replace existing lightweight plastic ones is a key to achieving further significant reductions.\"\nPlastics have been widely used in Australia in the past few decades but environmentalists say plastic bags have had a devastating impact on the nation's natural environment. According to Clean Up Australia plastic bags can take between 20 and 1000 years to break down. Despite their recyclable nature, an estimated 6.67 billion or 36,700 tonnes of plastic bags are disposed of in landfill sites throughout Australia each year.\nMany thousands of marine mammals and seabirds die every year around the world as a result of plastic litter. A 2004 NSW Parliamentary paper reported that plastic bags are of \"significant concern in the marine and aquatic environment, as aquatic life can be threatened through entanglement, suffocation and ingestion.\" The then Federal Environment Minister was reported as saying: \"All environmental ministers believe that all plastic bags should be phased out within five years. If this voluntary campaign isn\u2019t working then of course we have to consider what to do (next)\u2026.\""}

Toll booths would be set up at the border between the two states to collect revenues estimated in excess of $150 million annually, money that would be split by each state to help pay for needed maintenance of the interstate highway.\nVirginia has apparently changed plans to go it alone with road improvement priorities to the I-95 section at the approach and departure corridors to Washington, D.C. The state strategy of partnering with private, for-profit road construction companies, such as Clark Construction Group and Fluor Virginia Inc., necessarily meant the placement of revenue collecting toll booths where they are least wanted and most inconvenient, on the already congested interstate travel points near the capital city of the United States. \nTwo proposals to widen the Springfield Interchange Improvement Project with more high-occupancy-vehicle lanes near Washington, D.C. on the Virginia side come at a combined cost in the range of $1.5 billion for the state to complete. A public-private partnership to fund the improvements, looked at by Virginia's Department of Transportation in January 2005, has now taken on a less region specific funding solution in favor of an interstate solution.\nAs a practical matter, toll collection booths located at the North Carolina-Virginia state line would spare motorists in the most affected Virginia region the hassle and expense of toll payments, but it misses imposing a toll on roadway users who are most responsible for the needed improvements. That expense, as currently proposed, is passed on to motorists using I-95 for the longer haul.\nNorth Carolina governor Mike Easley has remained opposed to a Virginia-North Carolina Interstate Toll Road Compact. The estimated $4 billion in needed repairs to I-95 in that state, where in some places the roadway is 20-years-old, places a stress on budget resources necessary for the state to perform needed maintenance.\nSenator Clark Jenkins of Tarboro County in North Carolina proposed legislation \"to get the discussion started about the concept.\""}

These sites include the popular holiday destinations of Port Stephens in New South Wales and Westernport Bay in Victoria.\nThe institute identified sites based on the needs of nuclear power generators. They said the most important criteria is for the site to be on the coast so it has access to large volumes of water used by the reactor for cooling. The institute found inland locations are not suitable as \"Australia\u2019s inland water supplies are unreliable and are already over-committed.\"\nThe institute also reports that Port Stephens and Westernport Bay meet other desirable criteria, being near major electricity transmission lines and have good rail and port access for imported fuel rods.\nThe institute said that unused fuel rods would need to be imported, but \"spent fuel will need to be stored in perpetuity\". According to the institute, in Europe nuclear waste is often stored on the power plant's site.\nDr Clive Hamilton, executive director of the Australia Institute said that the government is yet to give an indication on potential nuclear power sites and there is only a small number of sites which would be suitable for a power generation reactor. \u201cIt is not clear whether the Government has yet considered where the proposed nuclear power plants will be located, but there are only a limited number of suitable sites. Other likely sites include the Central Coast and the area south of Wollongong in NSW, the Sunshine Coast in Queensland, and Port Phillip Bay and Portland in Victoria\u201d.\nMr Hamilton said that the institute had decided to investigate possible locations as there is little point having a nuclear debate where no possible sites are identified. \u201cThe Prime Minister has said he wants a national debate about nuclear power, but there is little point in debating it in the abstract\u201d.\nMayor of Port Stephens, Craig Baumann is not impressed by the Australia Institute's findings. He said he would be opposed to any nuclear power facility being built in Port Stephens.\n\"I just don't like the idea of any power station, something like Vailes Point being stuck on the shores of Port Stephens,\"\n\"Obviously the power station should be close to transport, obviously large volumes of water and the grid that it's meant to service\" Mr Baumann said.\nMr Baumann did however suggest a possible location for a power plant.\n\"I'd suggest that they move the ships out of Garden Island and stick it right in the middle of Sydney.\"\nIf the government decided on a location in Victoria for a nuclear power plant there would be some legal implications, requiring the federal government to overturn state law (which is difficult). Victoria enacted the Nuclear Activities (Prohibitions) Act in 1983 which states it is to \"protect the health, welfare and safety of the people of Victoria and to limit deterioration of the environment in which they dwell by prohibiting the establishment of nuclear activities\".\nUnder the act, nuclear power generation is specified as a prohibited activity."}

Among other provisions, the bill seeks to bolster security along the U.S.- border, create a guest worker program, and grant many illegal immigrants a path to citizenship, all positions supported by the Bush administration.\nThe bill passed today by the Senate is in stark contrast to the version passed by the House of Representatives in December 2005, which provides for no guest worker program and makes illegal immigration a felony.\nIn a statement, President Bush said, \"I look forward to working together with both the House of Representatives and the Senate to produce a bill for me to sign into law.\" \nSenate Majority Leader Bill Frist called for swift talks with the House to create a compromise measure. Frist, who had earlier supported the House version of the bill, voted in favor of the bill passed today. He expects that \"the most contentious part\" of the bill would be how to handle the status of illegal immigrants already in the United States.\nWhile Democratic senators were mostly united in support of the bill (38-4 in favor), Republican support was divided (32-23 against). Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-, said, \"The vast majority of the 11 million or so people here will be given every benefit this nation can bestow as a product of their illegality. I don't think that's a good principle.\"\nHouse Majority Leader , R-, acknowledged the difficulty in reaching a compromise, but expressed optimism that an agreement could be reached. \"I'm hopeful that we will come to a resolution and pass a bill,\" he said."}

The purpose of her visit was to inspect progress on Australia's newest nuclear research reactor - OPAL. Whilst at the facility, she received a report on the economics and safety of a nuclear power industry in Australia.\nOPAL, which stands for Open Pool Australian Light water reactor is expected to become fully operational by early 2007 and is in its final stage of development.\nThe reactor, which will replace Australia's sole nuclear reactor - HIFAR will be used to research microbiology, biotechnology and gene therapy in addition to the production of agents used in nuclear medicine.\nThe report presented to Ms Bishop at ANSTO was written by Professor John Gittus and discussed the economics and safety of nuclear energy in Australia.\nThe major conclusion of the study was that new generation nuclear power plants would be as competitive as newer types of coal power plants in Australia. The report also found that nuclear energy is \"the safest, most secure way of generating electricity with greater price stability in comparison to gas or coal power generation\" according to Ms Bishop.\nProf Gittus' report found that when the cost of environmental damage and carbon dioxide emissions from coal or gas fired power stations were considered, nuclear power becomes more attractive.\nSpeaking on the report, Ms Bishop said she wishes for an evidence-based debate about nuclear energy in Australia. \u201cI welcome this report as a useful contribution to what I hope will be an evidence-based debate about nuclear power in Australia. The debate must focus on the facts and not be biased by emotion.\u201d she said."}

Reports stated that America's offer had been \"welcomed\" by the Bharatiya Janata Party-led government in the state. This is the first time another nation has offered to help India tackle Naxalism in the latter country.\nThe Communist Party of India's Politburo reacted sharply to the offer, and condemned the Chattisgrah government for allowing foreign interference in India's affairs without the prior consent of the Centre. The CPI also asked the Central Government to clarify to the U.S Embassy that Washington's involvement in India's internal affairs was not welcome. CPI leaders A. B Bardhan and Shamim Faizi said such meddling was not new for the US, and recalled US Ambassador David Mulford's letter to West Bengal Chief Minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee criticising the latter's remarks against the American interference in India's internal matters.

Senate Sergeant at Arms Bill Pickle announced there were no injuries. FOX News reported that a man with a gun was apprehended by Capitol police, but no confirmation has been made of this.\nThe Senate was in session when the lockdown occurred, but the House of Representatives was not. Many members of congress had already departed in advance of the long Memorial Day holiday in the US. BBC News initially reported some witness as saying the sound may have been a car backfiring. The Associated Press and FOX News also reported speculation about fireworks or the gunfire having come from an indoor shooting range located in the basement of the Rayburn building. MSNBC suggested the noise may have been from a maintenance man working on an elevator shaft near the area where the shots were heard.\nPolice evacuated portions of Capitol Hill and told staff members to lock their office doors and \"stay inside\" as police searched the Rayburn Building floor by floor. At 3:15 p.m., CNN reported that Capitol Police had declared an \"all clear\" and employees and others inside the Rayburn Building were allowed to leave.\nEmployees in the Capitol complex were alerted to the incident via messages sent to their BlackBerries. They first urged employees to move to an interior office space away from windows, closing doors, grabbing their 'Go-Kits' and then to await further instructions. A second message sent at 12:20 p.m. EDT reminded employees to lock their office doors, and issued a code word that Capitol Police would use to confirm their identity when knocking at any door.\nAs the events unfolded, Bill Pickle said \"we have been told by staff of shots fired and the smell of smoke in the lobby of the Rayburn House building,\" said Mr Pickle. In a later statement he said \"Police responded to the area where they believed the shots came from and smelled what seemed to be gunpowder.\"\nAt a Press Conference lead by Sergeant Kimberly Schneider, public information officer of the U.S. Capitol Police, reported that shots were fired inside Rayburn House Office Building garage but that there were no current reports of injuries. It was later announced at 1:20 local time that there were two minor injuries, a woman who was shaken up and a policeman who twisted his ankle.\nCurrent evidence indicates that the reports of gunfire in the Rayburn Building were actually staffers and Congresspeople hearing the sound of construction work in the elevator. A mechanic was reported to be using a pneumatic hammer, the sound of which, when echoing up the elevator shaft, could be misheard as gunfire by those unaccustomed to either sound. Reports of smoke have not been officially explained, though several comments have chalked the reports of smoke up as paranoia induced, suspecting people heard the warning of gunfire and attributed the origin of a slight or strange smell to the ignition of gunpowder."}

The committee is expected to have three members from the four main parties (the DUP, UUP, SDLP and Sinn F\u00e9in) and two from the Alliance Party.\nThe two main parties did not take the news kindly. The Democratic Unionist Party will not sit on the committee if it leads to negotiations with the republicans as it continues not engage in direct talks with Sinn F\u00e9in nor will DUP take part in talks running alongside the talks between the parties and the premiers. \nSinn F\u00e9in says it will not sit on the committee if it turns out to be only a \"talking shop\". However, Martin McGuinness of Sinn F\u00e9in said the party will judge the committee \"on its ability to contribute to the restoration of the power-sharing executive\".\nThe Social Democratic and Labour Party says it will only enter if the committee \"is the vehicle for restoration of the agreement's institutions, not a talking shop or meaningless sideshow\".\nHowever, Ulster Unionist Party leader Sir Reg Empey was more optimistic and welcomed the initiative, commenting that the committee would \"ensure adequate cross-community consensus\". Empey further added, \"This committee prevents the DUP from running away from the substantive work that needs to be done in identifying the blockages that are standing in the way of the restoration of devolution.\"\nAttempts to form a new Northern Ireland Executive failed Monday when Ian Paisley, leader of the Democratic Unionist Party, refused the nomination to be the First Minister of Northern Ireland after being nominated by Sinn F\u00e9in leader Gerry Adams.\nLast month, Blair and Ahern made a joint statement calling for the return of home rule government in Northern Ireland as part of a plan by the two. They set a deadline of November 24 for power-sharing government to be set up in the Northern Ireland Assembly, which has been suspended since October 2002 over allegations of a IRA spy ring. One of the men implicated, Denis Donaldson, turned out to be a spy for British intelligence, he was murdered in his home on April 4, 2006, a few days before the statement by Blair and Ahern.\nIf no power-sharing government is formed by November 24, direct rule from London will continue but with greater input by the Republic of Ireland, a proposition which has greatly irked some unionists."}

It is important that students not get discouraged. They have to stay in school and pass their classes.\"\nOn May 12, Superior Court Judge Robert Freedman agreed with Gonzalez' argument that the state's use of the test as a graduation requirement was unconstitutional because poor and minority students don't have access to equal educational resources, and therefore don't have equal protection under the law. He issued an injunction against the use of the test. \nThat injunction seemed to pave the way for those of the 47,000 seniors statewide who haven't yet passed the test, but have completed all other requirements, to receive diplomas with their classmates at upcoming graduation events. \nBut State Superintendent of Schools Jack O'Connell quickly filed an appeal of Freedman's ruling and asked the State Supreme Court to issue a stay of Freedman's injunction. Earlier this week, the Court granted O'Connell's request for a stay, allowing schools to deny diplomas to students who haven't passed the test. The Court also ordered the Appellate court to hear O'Connell's appeal of Freedman's ruling against the test.\nOn Thursday, Gonzalez petitioned the Appellate Court to expedite their hearing of the case to as soon as next week, but today the court denied Gonzalez' request and scheduled the case for a hearing on July 25.\nIn an email to the \"James Logan Courier\", Gonzalez said he thinks his case is strong enough to withstand the appeal. \"We intend to vigorously defend Judge Freedman's ruling,\" he said, \"The record strongly supports his decision.\"\n\"If the court of appeals upholds Judge Freedman's ruling, students in the Class of 2006 may still receive their high school diplomas,\" he said.\nAbout 70 seniors at James Logan High School in Union City, Ca., mostly minorities and those who are learning English, still need to pass the test.\nO'Connell, an avid defender of the test, which is required by a law he wrote and championed when he was in the state legislature, said this week that he would make sure school districts knew that they had to require the test be passed in order to hand out diplomas to students.\n\"I will communicate with districts today to ensure they are aware that the exit exam is a graduation requirement\" he said, \"Students who have worked hard to pass this exam will be given a diploma that signifies their mastery of essential skills in reading and math.\""}

Civilian gangs, allegedly provided arms by the East Timorese military, have so far been blamed for much of the violence in Dili.\nAs the rest of the 1300 strong Australian deployment is expected to arrive in East Timor tomorrow, Australian Prime Minister John Howard has said that although his government did foresee the current situation in East Timor, military action would have constituted an invasion until mandated through the United Nations' or East Timorese government's request. \"...People say you should have seen it coming. The answer is yes, I did, but until you are asked, it happens to be an invasion.\" said Mr Howard. East Timor requested military assistance from Australia, Malaysia, New Zealand and Portugal on May 23, Foreign Minister Jose Ramos-Horta explaining that the government \"...[couldn't] control the situation,\"; all four nations responded positively to the request.\nDespite one newspaper running the headline \"We'll stay till job's done, says PM\", the Chief of Defence Force, Air Chief Marshall Angus Houston has said that he hopes the Australian military will be able to be replaced within a few months by a UN peacekeepers. In any case, ACM Houston has said that he is believes the Australian presence will stabilise the situation soon, perhaps aided by the good relations that exist between the ADF and the leader of the rebel group, Major Alfredo Reinado. MAJ Reinado was trained by the ADF for three months and has openly welcomed the arrival of the peacekeeping force, saying that the deployment is the \"only solution\" in the face of the government's inability to resolve the conflict.\nAfter praising the speed of the deployment, Washington revealed that the US assisted the transport of Australian troops to position in Townsville and Darwin two weeks earlier.\nIndonesia has now closed its border to East Timor, President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono saying that \"besides security reasons, the closure of the border is to prevent the possibility of issues that may worsen the image of Indonesia.\""}

Frustrated by a lack of political clout, Sorens proposed that libertarians - people who are socially tolerant and fiscally conservative - could move to a single state and have a much greater impact. Sorens received more than 200 messages in response, and the Free State Project was born.\nThe strategy has matured since that announcement, but the core idea remains intact. In a state with a population of 1.3 million, 20,000 activists can break beyond the novelty value of American third-party viewpoints.\nAs of this writing, over 7100 people have made that original pledge. This year, spurred by the success of early movers, a second pledge was created. Known as the \"First 1000\", this pledge has a strict timeline for success; 1000 people must agree, by the end of 2006, to move to New Hampshire by the end of 2008. Like the original statement of intent, should the signers fall short of the goal, none of them are obligated to follow through. As of today, nearly 300 people have signed on to the First 1000.\nMost Free Staters, or \"Porcupines\" so named for the group's mascot, know each other only by way of communicating over the Internet. Once per year, they shed their online monikers and meet in real life, at the annual Porcupine Freedom Festival, known affectionately as \"Porcfest\".\nPorcfest '05 brought an estimated 500 activists from around the country, including former Presidential candidate Michael Badnarik. While the press attended the event, Free Staters used the festival as an opportunity to socialize and relax.\nExternal links.\nFree State Project"}

Benedict XVI addressed young people in his speech and was met with applause. Benedict XVI expressed his contentment with his visit in Poland.\nTomorrow will be the last day in the pilgrimage; the Pope will visit the site of the Nazi concentration camp in Auschwitz and meet with representatives of other religions.\nReactions to the visit.\nThere were some concerns about the reaction of Polish people to Benedict XVI - based on their strong attachment to his predecessor. However, the Pope was warmly welcomed and people were excited by the visit.\nThe pilgrimage garnered significant media attention, not only Polish press, but also from other countries. Seven TV stations, including CNN, NBC, BBC, and EuroNews, broadcast live reports from the event. Journalists from several German stations and Russian NTW came to Poland for the visit."}

{"id": "41815", "revid": "14511", "url": "https://en.wikinews.org/wiki?curid=41815", "title": "Interview with LibriVox founder Hugh McGuire", "text": "Old books never die. They don't even fade away. Instead, their copyright expires and they are released into the public domain, where hordes of volunteers breathe new life into them. Groups like Project Gutenberg, Distributed Proofreaders and Wikisource digitize, preserve and categorize classic works of literature, old encyclopedias, and even periodicals.\nHugh McGuire, a writer from Montreal, decided that he did not only want to read these voices from the past \u2014 he wanted to hear them. \"On a practical level,\" he says, \"I wanted to download a free audiobook.\" Disappointed with the somewhat meager outcome of his search, he decided to create an open community website dedicated to creating spoken word versions of public domain texts. In August 2005, LibriVox was born. The call to action is simple enough:\nLess than a year later, the website features a hundred or so completed books, and 300 people have contributed chapters or poetry. \"Probably another 400\nhave done or are expected to do chapters for books not yet completed or cataloged,\" McGuire explains. The finished audio files, like the texts they come from, are released into the public domain and offered in the MP3 and Ogg Vorbis file formats. Volunteers use the active forums and a wiki to collaborate. We asked Hugh McGuire about the state of the project, internationalization, and the place of LibriVox in the larger free content community.\nWhy did you decide to take the acoustic fate of public domain works into your own hands, and how did you go about it? \nI think that a vibrant public domain is very important to a healthy world, and so I thought: here's a way to help the cause. I launched LibriVox, emailed some friends and some podcasters who where doing literary stuff, and invited them to record a chapter of Joseph Conrad's \"Secret Agent.\" Things have grown steadily since. By the way, AKMA was the first guy I know of to do something like this, with [Lawrence] Lessig's \"Free Culture.\" That, I think, started my thinking about this, but it took a while for the idea to crystallize.\nDo you personally record audiobooks, and did you already do so before LibriVox?\nLibriVox was my first experience recording audiobooks. I still do the odd chapter, but i am a bit delinquent in finishing some of them these days!\nIs there a particular LibriVox book which you think stands out because of the quality, the overall effort involved, its popularity, or for some other reason?\nMy personal favourite is \"Notes from the Underground\" (Dostoyevsky). Other random good ones: \n[Ed.: See the LibriVox catalog for a full index.]\nBrowsing the catalog, I find that the quality of the spoken audio varies greatly from text to text or even from chapter to chapter. If someone wanted to re-record a chapter because they didn't like the speaker, would you then offer two versions?\nYes. We take the Wikipedia approach: if you think it should be better, please help it be so. You'll note we offer a couple of versions of some books. Indeed our weekly poetry project celebrates this diversity of voice: each week a new short poem is chosen and as many readers as wish to record a version, so you get 20+ versions of the same poem, a very interesting audio experience.\nBesides works whose copyright has expired, there is an increasing number of modern books available under Creative Commons and similar licenses. You mentioned Larry Lessig's \"Free Culture\", but it also includes some out of print titles by publishers who are open to the concept, such as O'Reilly. Do you want to limit the scope of LibriVox strictly to old public domain works, or do you have plans to include recent works under reasonably permissive licenses as well?\nWe are only doing public domain works, for a number of reasons, partly to keep simplicity in our copyright situation -- public domain means its as simple as can be. CC makes things more complex. Also, there are other sites, notably podiobooks.com, which are better suited to CC works than LibriVox. we find it makes things clear and easy to say: published works, public domain, and leave it at that.\nAs far as I can tell, podiobooks.com features \"free as in beer\" content \u2014 material which you can download, but which isn't under a free content license. Instead of \"public domain\", wouldn't \"free content\" work just as well, using something like the Free Content Definition to limit the scope?\nThis needs more discussion obviously: we chose public domain because the texts we use are public domain and we didn't want to add new\nrestrictions, especially not non-commercial, since already our recordings are being used for a number of commercialish projects (I can't recall any specific project names, but some pay-education sites use LV stuff). That's good and well and fine with us. We don't want to have to give anyone permission to use our recordings, we want anyone to use them for whatever they want.\nAlso, for the thing to work you need to have many dedicated volunteers willing to do the management (onerous) and many willing to do the reading. While \"Pride and Prejudice\" will attract many readers, I don't know about O'Reilly's latest tome on XML... though I might be wrong.\nAre there plans to fully internationalize the website?\nLV is a totally open project, so where the volunteers go, we go. We have books in German, Italian, French, Spanish, Hebrew, Finnish, Japanese, Old English... and possibly a few more. We also have a wiki, and our response to such questions is to encourage any non-anglos to make translations there, and we can incorporate into the site as needed. We have a language policy, which basically says that in general the forum language is English (so that admin know what's going on) but that if a non-English book project is started, the language in that thread can be whatever volunteers wish to use.\nI was thinking specifically about things like the user interface of the website and the forums. Are there plans to internationalize these? Many people speak no English at all, so an English website might not work for them.\nIn order for this to happen we need volunteers willing to do it. We have no budget (literally zero) and our structure is totally loose and open, so if a volunteer or group of volunteers offer to do this, we will find a way to help make it happen. There is the constraint that we'd be most comfortable with active volunteers doing it, who understand the project and its particularities. \nSince everything is volunteer, the current admin would have to find the time to manage this, too, but I expect if there were a serious desire on the part of some volunteers, we'd have no problem adding the text. We have a wiki, where anyone is welcome to write the text in whatever language, and then we could easily post pages up to the site.\nHas podcasting helped you in gaining more awareness?\nSure! Podcasting was the inspiration for LV ... easy, cheap, do-it-yourself audio! Superb. Podcasting is an important part of our distribution, but torrents and regular downloads are probably bigger.\nSo, do you have an idea how many people listen to your podcast?\nLast estimation was in the 5000 range.\nBesides human readers, there's also the fully automated approach of turning text into sound. Text-to-speech software is getting better every year, with an increasing focus on \"natural\" voices.\nI don't find text-to-speech very interesting. LV is about people reading to you, which is very different than having a computer - no matter the naturalness - read to you. Our recordings have mistakes, fumbles, coughs, and beautiful human voices being human, reading wonderful works of literature. It's not \"just\" transmission of audio information, it's something much more, and something no computer, robot etc. could ever replicate. \nDo you not sometimes get worried that your work might eventually be made obsolete by technology?\nSee above, but we don't really feel like we are in competition with other projects. Many of us are working for similar goals, and there's room for many of us. Personally, I am very much interested in what the \"readers\" get out of the process, as much as the listeners. If there are computer-generated public domain audiobooks, so much the better. There are also many other audiolit projects, and we all seem to be doing parallel stuff. I think that's great. The beauty of LV, podcasting etc. is that it's all so cheap to do - you can have your choice. I will choose a real human reading over a computer reading any day, but others might not agree. That's fine. LVers read out of love of literature, and nothing more. \nWikisource is the Wikimedia project which digitizes and archives free content texts. There's also an existing Wikimedia effort to create spoken versions of Wikipedia articles. Are you guys aware of each other, and possibly already working together?\nWe're aware of some of these projects, and have corresponded with some of these and others. There's so much to do! It's great that so many are doing this stuff, and that people can choose the things that interest them. this is the thing about LV (as with Wikipedia etc) ... we can't control our volunteers, nor do we want to. We just give a framework, and hope for the best. \nWhat is the last audiobook you've listened to?\nTo be honest, I haven't listened to a full book in a long while! Last chapter I listened to was from Whitman's \"Leaves of Grass.\" "}

After a long investigation the FIA's stewards decided to cancel all his fast laps as a penalty for the unsporting behaviour displayed by him. Article 112 of the regulations, applied by FIA, prevents the F1 team Ferrari to appeal this decision. Thus, Schumacher and Felipe Massa, who crashed his car earlier in the qualification, were last on the starting grid. The Ferrari team decided to change the engine in both cars, because there was no more stringent penalty that could have been imposed on them. Michael started the race from the pit-lane.\nAlonso was in the lead for the most of the race. Kimi Raikkonen and Mark Webber, who were the only serious competitors to Alonso for the first part of the race, lost their cars (due to engine failure) almost simultaneously, one by one.

The court also wanted the Centre to explain the basis on which castes would be classified as \"backward\" or \"forward\".\nThe government has been granted eight weeks time by the Bench to file an affidavit in regard to this notice. The apex court also said that it would examine the effects of this policy, which, the petitioner said, would divide the country on the basis of caste thereby threatening India's integrity. The Bench said that the questions posed to it had serious social and political significance and would hence be dealt with appropriately. The two petitions were filed by Shiv Khera and advocate Ashok Kumar Thakur. Additional Solicitor General Gopal Subramianam, who was representing the respondents, accepted the notice and appreciated the Court's view that striking medical students should return to work in the interest of the patients.\nThe medical students welcomed this move and have decided to start running parallel outpatient clinics from tomorrow onwards. They have however clarified that their movement will continue despite the government's assurances that the number of seats in institutes will be increased. The main opposition party, the BJP has said that it supports the reservation policy, but that financially disadvantaged students from the \"forward\" castes should also be given consideration."}

I don\u2019t want any arrangement that in any way disturbs that\". Mr Howard's statements come after the Queensland branches of both parties held separate meetings where the proposal to amalgamate them was supported in-principle.\nIn an interview with ABC Radio yesterday, Mr Howard said there had only been an agreement made to discuss whether a merger of the two parties should occur and that nothing was concrete at this stage. Mr Howard warned that the proposal would need to be discussed with both parties at a federal level and that the state's decision would not be able to be made in isolation.\nThe Australian leader said that as the leader of the Liberal party he would not support any move that would dilute the party's identity. \"Now speaking for myself as leader of the Liberal Party throughout the country, I am totally opposed to anything that would alter the existing identity of the Liberal Party,\" he said.\n\"I am opposed to any new name for the Liberal Party in Queensland, I don\u2019t want New Liberals, or Old Liberals, I just want the Liberal Party of Australia operating throughout the country\" Mr Howard told ABC Radio.\nMr Howard said that he believes the coalition between the Liberal and National parties had served him well over the past ten years and that he supports a close relationship between the two parties.\nThe Prime Minister hinted that the only merger he would support would be one in which the Liberal party takes over the National party. He said he would not support a new conservative party in the state.\nWhile quick to say that he was not wishing for National party members to quit the national party and join the Liberals, it was noted Mr Howard did not say he was opposed to the idea.\nIn the statesman's view the Queensland Liberals are part of a nation-wide party, and Mr Howard vowed to fight any proposal that would split them from the rest of the country. \nAustralia's highest ranked National party member, Deputy Prime Minister Mark Vaile has said that he sees little need for change. He told ABC Radio that he believes the coalition have a \"winning formula\" federally. Mr Vaile also said he had concerns about how the proposal could affect the coalition at the federal level.\nMr Vaile said that the decision to merge would be left to the National party's Queensland members. He said that the national party operates differently to other parties in that it is based at a divisional level within each state and then forms together federally.

The party titled \"Naastenliefde, Vrijheid en Diversiteit (NVD)\" - Neighbourly Love, Freedom and Diversity - is set to enter the 2007 \"Tweede Kamer\" (Lower House) elections, though they are not expected to gain any seats.\nControversially, the party - or NVD - wants to abolish the legal minimum age for youth sexual contact with other youth, lower the legal minimum age for sexual contact with adults to 12, then eventually abolish age restrictions altogether. The members think, contrary to established law protecting minors from sexual abuse, legalising voluntary sex at a young age will diminish the risk of excesses. \nAd van den Berg, one of the pedophile party's founders, says: \"Forbidding it will only feed the curiosity of children. (...) Raising children also means letting them get acquainted with sex.\" The minimum ages for youth-youth sex and youth-adult sex in the Netherlands currently stands at 16 and 18 respectively. \nThe NVD also wants to decriminalise much of the porn industry with plans to legalize the possession of child pornography. They want to lower the minimum age for participation in a pornography production; this currently stands at 18, but the group wants the age to be lowered to 12. The child sex advocates from the NVP say any child who is sexually active at age 12 could voluntarily act in a porn movie. \nThe party also wants to establish a child pornography \"hallmark\", which would somehow ensure involvement of minors in a specific production was voluntary. \nIreen van Engelen exposes the underlying motives of the small but radical group of pedophile campaigners: \"They make it appear as if they wish for more rights for children, but their stance that children from age 12 up should be allowed to enter into sexual contacts of course only serves their own interest.\"\nPolitical scientist Joop van Holsteyn thinks the establishment of the NVD to decriminalise acts most people find abhorrent is a Trojan horse to insert the subject into an otherwise unwilling political debate. \"What is ethically sound is not laid down in the law: it is an element of the political struggle. If it gains publicity, they already have attained their goal, but they will find more opponents than proponents.\""}

The festival, which will last until June 4, consists of a series of LGBT cultural events, including film screenings, theatre and photographic exhibitions, as well as public debates about LGBT issues, and a gay pride parade on June 3, expected to attract hundreds of people. GayFest is organised by ACCEPT, Romania's largest LGBT organisation, and supported by the Romanian Government and Ministry of Health, as well as various private organisations.\nThe main theme of the third GayFest is the legalisation of same-sex civil unions and marriages in Romania. Florin Buhuceanu, the executive manager of ACCEPT, said that, \"The time has come for Romania to acknowledge the rights of all its citizens. Guaranteeing the equality of rights through the recognition of gay marriage... is just a step forward.\" He added that, \"The [GayFest] activities mark the most focused drive yet to change opinions on gay marriage in Romania.\" Same-sex couples currently have no legal recognition in Romania. Legalisation of either civil unions or marriage between people of the same sex would be possible through an amendment of the Family Code, if approved by a majority in parliament.\nLast year's GayFest, which included the country's first gay pride parade, attracted a significant amount of controversy from right-wing groups, as well as the Romanian Orthodox Church. It was initially not given authorisation from the Bucharest City Hall, which claimed that it could not guarantee its security. Approval was, however, later given due to pressure from the Romanian President, Traian B\u0103sescu and the Justice Minister, Monica Macovei, both of whom support LGBT rights. \nUnlike recent gay pride parades in Poland and Moscow, which ended in violence and were actively opposed by government officials, this year's Bucharest GayFest parade was authorised by the City Hall without controversy, even though the Romanian Orthodox Church is once again expected to protest its organisation. In the past few years, Romania has significantly changed its gay rights record, introducing an anti-discrimination law in 2000 that includes sexual orientation, and repealing its last anti-gay law, Article 200 of the Penal Code, in 2001."}

Currently, the stores for Apple and Sony sell music only for use on their own players. Critics of the changes say that the Senate's changes would defeat the purpose of the bill. \nThe two versions must now be reconciled in conference committee, a process that could take months.\nSpeaking in support of the bill, Assembly member Christian Paul said, \"We oppose the idea that the seller of a song or any kind of work can impose on the consumer the way to read it, forever, and especially in the consumer's home.

The search warrant was given on grounds of alleged copyright violation and assisting copyright violation. This move comes as a bit of a surprise, as the legality of the site has been under public debate for over three years, with the operators frequently issuing public press releases. \n\"WiredFire\", in an interview with Rickard Falkvinge, head of the Swedish , is reporting that police arrested three staff members, ultimately taking only two into custody. The \"Associated Press\", however, is reporting that Ulf Goranzon, a police spokesman, is claiming that none were arrested, they were just under suspicion of violating copyright law.\nThe site operators speculate that the police wish to test the legality of the operation. Purportedly, this move comes due to political pressure exerted by United States media corporations. Swedish public broadcaster has backed this claim. Rickard Falkvinge has stated that the (Swedish Anti-Piracy Bureau) has admitted to being behind the police action, and he suspects the IFPI is also involved. Tobias Andersson, of Piratbyr\u00e5n agrees, claiming that The Antipiratbyr\u00e5n \"has clearly misled the police\" and \"has fooled the police into shutting down its antagonists, the Piratbyr\u00e5n. The Antipiratbyr\u00e5n previously gained notoriety by paying an infiltrator to plant copyrighted material on the Swedish ISP Bahnhof's servers.\nDan Glickman, CEO of the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA), has applauded the move, citing it as a reminder that \"there are no safe harbors for copyright thieves\". Kori Bernards, an MPAA representative, claimed The Pirate Bay to be \"one of our No. 1 targets.\" The MPAA allege that The Pirate Bay made available over 150 thousand files, including summer blockbusters such as \"Mission: Impossible III\" and \"X-Men 3\". \nHowever, The Pirate Bay claimed that as they only host .torrent files and not copyrighted material, they are not in contravention of copyright laws. The Pirate Bay also served as a distribution point for freely licensed material such as some Linux distributions and independent music and film.\nThe Pirate Bay claims to be the world's largest tracker.\nIn the raid, the police also took several private servers unconnected to The Pirate Bay. Some have claimed that there is no legal basis for these seizures.\nInitially, there were also rumors that this could be another stunt by The Pirate Bay to promote awareness. This possibility, however, has been already dismissed and only had some credibility given the fact that approximately one year ago today they claimed something similar like this, but instead were simply updating their servers. At current there are already some publications made available by officials confirming the authenticity of the raid.\nOn June the 1st The Pirate Bay site changed its \"Site down\" note to \"Site down - will be up and fully functional within a day or two\".\nGottfrid Svartholm, owner of webhotel PRQ said \"I was arrested for interrogation, and they begun to ask question about Pirate Bay, what I knew and what connections I had to it. I got no public defender, and my regular legal representative was also under arrest, so I said nothing at all\". According to Mr. Svartholm, the police told him that they were not obligated to provide a public defender, as the crime he was accused of doesn't lead to jail sentence if he is found guilty. \nThe day after the raid, Mr. Svartholm is trying to limit the damage for PRQ's other customers that also had their servers confiscated, even if they didn't have any connections to The Pirate Bay.

Close beat out 274 other contestants from 9 to 15 years old. This was Close's last year of eligibility; she was one of only two contestants this year to be in her fifth year at the national competition. She finished seventh in 2005, having gotten a better ranking every year she's competed.\nThis is the Bee's first appearance on network television, with the finals airing on ABC; earlier rounds were televised in the afternoon on ESPN. Close, who enjoys running, music, reading, and her puppy, is the first New Jersey resident ever to win the competition, which she prepared for up to two hours each day. \nSaryn Hooks, 14, was nearly eliminated in the eighth round, with \"hechsher\", a symbol indicating that a food has been certified kosher. The judges mistakenly had the word down as \"hechscher\"; after being removed, she was reinstated in the next round after the judges received the correction. Hooks, who spent six months reading the entire dictionary to prepare, came back with confidence and finished in third place, missing \"icteritious\" in round twelve. This is the first time the judges have made such a visible error in the televised broadcast.\nKendra Yoshinaga, 12, of Thousand Oaks, California, a favorite for the finals, was knocked out in the seventh round just before the ABC broadcast began by \"cointise\", a scarf worn on a lady's headdress. Yoshinaga said that this third national bee she's competed in felt \"a lot more rigid\" than the previous two. \nThis year's schedule was rearranged for the ABC news broadcast: previous championships have been held earlier in the day. The spellers have all been given more media attention; for this reason Yoshinaga is perhaps one of the few who didn't want to win, claiming that it would be too much. She has already received her share of attention, as co-author of \"The Spelling Bee And Me: A Real-Life Adventure In Learning\", a children's book about her experiences.\n\"People I don't know very well seem to make a big deal about it, but my really close friends know that it's not a really huge part of my life,\" she says, of her relative fame. Keenly interested in politics and social issues, Yoshinaga spent a large portion of her last two trips sightseeing in Washington, but this trip, she says, has been more focused on studying.\n\"My mom sometimes finds words for me from books and magazines,\" says the homeschooler, who studied over 30,000 words in the week preceding the national bee. Paige Kimble, bee coordinator, wouldn't have been surprised to see her break into the top ten.\nAnother favorite eliminated earlier on in the competition was Samir Patel, who tied for second in last year's 19-round marathon and placed third in 2003. Patel misspelled \"eremacausis\" in round 7, joining Yoshinaga and 6 others in a tie for 14th place. \nThe studious 12-year-old has one more chance at the national finals; Yoshinaga has two, as students may compete from their fourth through eighth grade years.\nCody Boisclair, a 23-year-old graduate student at the University of Georgia, misses the competition. He competed in the 1997 and 1998 finals, placing fourth in his second try. The Bee has changed since he began participating, becoming more international, and with increased media attention putting more pressure on spellers. Though many critics claim that the rote memorization and drilling of spelling bees is not a particularly beneficial activity, Boisclair believes his experience in the bee helped his knowledge of language rather than serving as a simple display of memory.\n\"I was one of those people who tried to dissect the word into its component parts, to find similarities to other words that I was familiar with,\" says Boisclair, who began reading at the age of two. \"Although I did do some drilling, I tried to find relationships to help me remember words, and even tried to analyze the words I was studying as I studied them.\" His analysis skills led him not to a career in lexicography or linguistics but rather to graduate study in computer science.\nBoisclair, who spent the evening watching the Bee on television while in a chat room with several other former national finalists, looks back on the competition as one of the highlights of his school years. \"I think the best thing about it was a sense of camaraderie\u2014for once, I really felt like I fit in somewhere. I was with people my age who were, by and large, 'on the same wavelength'.\" \nAlso, Jasmine Kaneshiro, 14, from Honolulu, Hawaii, was not a favorite, having done quite badly last year, did better. She moved up from 72nd place in the 2005 bee to 45th place. It was her second year. \"I'm pleased with my performance this year,\" Kaneshiro said. \nSources.\n "}

CAA director John Jones said that the proposal was rejected because it was not cost effective. A spokesman yesterday reaffirmed that position.\n\"Failure to endorse the major safety recommendation of the study team would expose the director to a level of risk that would be difficult to defend in the event of an incident at Taupo that might have been mitigated by an [information service]. We believe your recommendation would place the travelling public and aviation participants at risk and would be indefensible in a Coroners Court,\" study team leader Len Wicks wrote in an internal memo.\nThe New Zealand Airline Pilots Association has issued 11 \"special operating procedures\" for pilots at the Taupo airport. The airport that had the next lowest number of air traffic controllers is that of Umtata, South Africa, which has five.\nTaupo is the tenth busiest airport in New Zealand. It receives and sends out more flights than Napier, Dunedin or Invercargill, but this distinction is largely negated by its air traffic control woes.\nAir New Zealand Eagle Air general manager Doug Roberts, however, said that his airline had been flying to Taupo for decades without difficulty. Likewise, Taupo Air Charter, which has operated in Taupo for 25 years, has suffered no problems in its flights."}

The man in charge of the operation, Graeme Pearson, director of the Scottish Crime and Drug Enforcement Agency, called the find \"the most significant discovery of the drug in the UK.\" \nDenise Caron MacPherson, 45, and Hanan Rabin, 53, have been charged with exporting the drug, also known as GHB, to the United States between 19 April and 24 May. The news of the Scottish factory comes as a US study found drug use was involved in two-thirds of sex attacks, while 5 per cent were given an actual \"date rape\" drug.\nGraham Rhodes for The Roofie Foundation, a helpline for victims of drug rape, said: \"I am very relieved this has been recovered as in the wrong hands it is very dangerous. Not only is it used to spike the drinks of people to rape them but it's also used to assault and rob people.\"\nUsed by ravers, robbers and bodybuilders, the base chemical (gamma-hydroxybutyrate) was taken during a raid on a house and business in West Lothian. The haul would have been put on the United States illicit drug market and sold for fun and more sinister purposes.\nIn its non-powder form GHB is barely detectable: clear and having no smell it can be particularly potent with a few drops mixed into an alcoholic drink. Once a sufficient amount of the salty liquid has been ingested the victim can be knocked out within an hour.\nWhile GHB is known both as \"liquid ecstasy\" and the date rapist's \"Plan A\", the versatile compound is also used by body builders instead of anabolic steroids, by dieters and as a sleeping aid.\nIn Britain, GHB is a \"Class C\" drug which means making it, holding it and selling it is punishable with up to two years in prison. The effects of rape, for which the drug is reportedly used, can last a lifetime. Jane Cumming, from support group Crisis, said she received an average of 4 calls a week from people claiming to be victims of date rape.\nThe pair, who were caught in Livingston, were accused of distributing the drug in Scotland from MacPherson's house around the same time as they were exporting to the United States, while MacPherson was also charged with Cannabis possession."}

The QRU later revealed that one of the Queensland sides will most likely be playing out of Queensland Rugby's old home Ballymore Stadium, with the other team going to either the Gold Coast or Northern Queensland.\nSome Sydney clubs, in particular, Randwick and Sydney University Football Club were opposed to the competition, and want stand-alone status in the competition rather than being part of a cumulative Sydney team, also believing that the competition will see them lose funding. Businessman John Singleton came out and showed his interest in having one of the NSW sides playing at Central Coast Stadium.\nSuper 14 players will be playing, but as there will be twice as many clubs as the Super 14, so there will be a lot of available spaces for club footballers. There is no plan for an immediate draft. Although Super 14 players will be playing, around 30 players will be unavailable due to Wallaby duties. The ABC has apparently expressed interest in broadcasting the games next year."}

In 2004, Mr Costello said that each family should have three children. After seeing the statistics for 2005, he said \"One for mum, one for dad, and one for the country - it was a light-hearted way of making a serious point,\"\n\"I am delighted that at least some families have been taking up the challenge,\" said Mr Costello.\nThe Howard government believes that Australia's aging population and low birth rates will threaten the country's economy in the future.\nAs part of the 2004 budget, the Howard government introduced an AUD $3,000 maternity payment to all mothers who give birth to a child. As of July, the payment will increase to $4,000. As a further incentive to have more children the government increased family tax benefits and from July, will allow families to claim a 30 percent childcare rebate (capped at AUD$3000 per year).\nWayne Swan, the opposition's treasury spokesperson said Mr Costello isn't the reason for the boom. \"I am willing to let Peter Costello claim credit for higher interest rates, even higher fuel prices, but I think claiming his charms have lifted the national libido may be a bridge too far\" he said."}

It is possible the Republicans will use this finding to gain a political edge come election time. An amendment such as one to ban gay marriage may not pass, but some assert this will be a vote-winner for the Republicans during the mid-term polls in November.\nAny such amendment would need two-thirds approval in the House of Representatives (290 out of 435) and the Senate (67 out of 100) as well as the approval of three-fourths of the state legislatures (38 out of 50). Currently, the Republican Party holds 231 seats in the House and 55 seats in the Senate, and has majority control of 20 state legislatures. A similar amendment was defeated in 2004."}

However, one source claims that it was actually Abul Koyair who pulled the trigger, accidentally wounding his brother in the panic - an allegation that Koyair has denied.\nThe brothers, who are both Muslim and of Bangladeshi origin, are being questioned today at London's high-security Paddington Green Police Station. Meanwhile, police officers are still searching the house for a device, which they believe to be a conventional explosive with added chemical components.\nDue to the ongoing investigations, there is still a large police presence at the residence, as well as a layer of sheeting surrounding the building. Despite the small yet ever-present chance of a chemical incident, other residents of the street have not been evacuated. \nIn response to safety fears, police said that \"nothing suspicious was found in an initial search of the house and that neighbours are not in danger.\"\nBBC News reported that Health Secretary Patricia Hewitt was \"keeping ministers informed\" about the unfolding situation but would not comment about specific points of the investigation."}

Meanwhile, a list of possible sites for nuclear reactors has been leaked by the Opposition to media. The locations, listed in 1997, include Adelaide, Darwin, Perth, Lucas Heights, Goulburn, Holsworthy, and Broken Hill in New South Wales and other sites.\nWest Australian (WA) premier Alan Carpenter says the list of fourteen potential sites were a \"facade to soften up Western Australians into accepting a nuclear waste dump.\" The WA Premier said people would not only be surprised but \"stunned to learn that the federal cabinet considered possible sites... without disclosing them to any state government.\" \nMr Carpenter said in a media release that the document mentions a site near Perth airport. \"People should wake up to what's happening around Australia, particularly in WA,\" said Mr. Carpenter. \"Only a few weeks ago, we had three prominent WA Liberal MPs supporting a nuclear waste dump in WA,\" he said. \"This is all a facade in the Howard Government's push to soften up West Australians for a nuclear waste dump.\" \nPremier Carpenter, whose Labor government stridently opposes uranium mining in WA, stated his opposition to a nuclear waste dump: \"I vehemently oppose the prospect of our State becoming the dumping ground for the world's nuclear waste and that is what will happen if we allow uranium mining in WA. The evidence is mounting and indisputable.\"\nThe South Australian Government has ruled out any possible nuclear power plant in SA. \"A nuclear power plant would bankrupt our state,\" SA Premier Mike Rann said. \"It would not be commercially viable and would not, in my view, be acceptable to the public. Nuclear power plants need giant populations to sustain them, there is no-one coming to me from the commercial sector or the mining industry or anywhere else, suggesting a nuclear power plant.\"\nEarlier, Foreign Affairs Minister Alexander Downer said South Australia should build a nuclear power station to run a desalination plant. Premier Rann dismissed the idea as ridiculous and said comments by Mr Downer highlight divisions within Federal Cabinet. He said Mr Downer is at odds with the Federal Finance Minister Nick Minchin, who says the high costs of nuclear power would rule it out.\nMr Rann says South Australia will not allow nuclear power. \"For once I'm agreeing with Nick Minchin,\" he said. \"I think Nick Minchin is right that a nuclear power plant isn't necessary and won't happen and I think that Alexander Downer is having a bit of a lend of him.\" \nVictoria's Energy Minister Theo Theophanous said nuclear energy in Australia did not make sense when the cost and problems of waste disposal were considered. Mr Theophanous has rejected a report that found nuclear power could be competitive with conventional energy generation if it was subsided with help from a taxpayer subsidy.\nA recent report found nuclear power could compete with gas or coal-fired electricity if taxpayers helped to pay for it or shouldered the risk of its production. The ANSTO report found nuclear plants could be built in the next 10 to 15 years and an Australian version would cost about $2.5 billion to establish. To make it viable, taxpayers would pay hundreds of million towards start-up costs, said the report.\nBut Mr Theophanous said Victoria had already had concluded the nuclear proposal did not add up. \"I had my department look at this and provide a report to me more than a year ago in relation to the prospect of nuclear power,\" he said. \"The problem is a commercial one as much as anything else. It costs roughly double the price to produce power out of nuclear energy. If you're going to pay double the price, why not put in wind farms? Why not use renewable energy, which is even cheaper than nuclear energy?\" said Mr Theophanous .\nThe Victoria Government urges householders to reduce greenhouse emissions by reducing daily energy consumption. A new campaign identifies simple measures residents can adopt to cut power bills and greenhouse emissions, including turning the heating thermostat to no more than 20C, washing clothes in cold water and turning appliances off at the switch when they are not being used.\nNew South Wales Premier Morris Iemma has also declared his opposition to nuclear power. He said no nuclear power stations would be built in NSW as long as he is premier. Mr Iemma urged state opposition leader Peter Debnam to join him in opposing the construction of nuclear power plants in NSW. \"While ever I'm premier of NSW there won't be any nuclear power plants in NSW,\" he told reporters.\nQueensland Premier Peter Beattie says he \"would not jeopardize the state's coal industry by supporting a nuclear power plant.\" Mr. Beattie has ruled out uranium mining in Queensland to protect the state's huge coal industry. He said he would not support a nuclear power plant. \"The State Government would not support it,\" Mr. Beattie said. \n\"We have the power to block them and we would block them, we would not support nuclear power. Why would we have a nuclear reactor in competition with the coal industry?\" Mr. Beattie told media.\nClimate change.\nThe Australian Conservation Foundation (ACF) chairman Don Henry says a nuclear debate must consider climate change. \"If the inquiry is just about nuclear power it will be a waste of taxpayers money because nuclear power is too dangerous, too dirty, and too slow to tackle climate change,\" he said. \"If the inquiry is going to be fairdinkum, it needs to look at that issue: what can we do right now to tackle climate change in Australia?\"\nAustralian Greens climate change and energy spokesperson Senator Christine Milne said in a media release: \"Instead of turning to nuclear power, Australia should ratify the Kyoto Protocol, invest in renewable energy, adopt a national energy efficiency target and improve public transport. \"Several studies examining options to achieve deep cuts in Australian greenhouse emissions all show this goal can be achieved, cost effectively, without resorting to nuclear power.\" \nGreens Senator Rachel Siewert says: \"The nuclear industry is engaged in a concerted effort to be given one last chance for redemption... yet every step of the nuclear fuel chain, from mining, milling, enrichment and operating reactors to waste storage, is subject to the same human error, material breakdowns, complexity and incompetence as any other area of human endeavour.\" said Senator Siewert. \"The current inventory of nuclear waste will already present our descendents with a monstrous intergenerational headache. Allowing so much as a kilogram more of this material to be produced is simply immoral.\" \nThe ACF say \"nuclear energy is not a solution to climate change.\" ACF President Professor Ian Lowe says \"Nuclear is too slow to provide any legitimate answer to climate change or to energy security for the developing world.\" The ACF report that, as an energy source globally, uranium provides less power than renewables do. \"Uranium is inextricably linked to very serious environmental and health problems via nuclear weapons and radioactive waste. There is nothing ideological about opposing its use...\"\nNuclear inquiry.\nThe Australian Newspaper reports that Prime Minister Howard is preparing to appoint chief scientist Jim Peacock, a supporter of nuclear power, and other high-level nuclear industry experts to the team. The public inquiry, to be undertaken by three or four selected experts is expected to \"examine the economics of nuclear energy, health, safety, environmental and proliferation issues as well as waste and storage.\" The taskforce will take submissions and is expected to prepare a report to Government within four or five months, with the Government's response early in 2007.\nThe Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation (ANSTO), Ian Smith, says \"at least three\" power plants would be required. Mr Howard said the ANSTO report challenged the view that the cost of nuclear power was prohibitive. Dr Smith told a Senate estimates hearing that Australia would require \"multiple power stations to make the industry viable\".\nFederal Industry Minister Ian Macfarlane said the nuclear energy inquiry would also include consideration of nuclear enrichment plants in Australia. Mr Macfarlane said he would consider a nuclear power plant in his own Toowoomba electorate. \nPrime Minister John Howard insisted he would not be deterred by the unpopularity of nuclear power."}

The soldiers were received by the Portuguese ambassador to East Timor, local representatives and hundreds of locals.\nAfter the landing of the aircraft that transported the Portuguese soldiers at approximately 7 a.m. local time (2200 Saturday, UTC), hundreds of people started to enter the runway with flags of East Timor and Portugal. In addition to the hundreds of locals that were expecting the GNR soldiers, the Portuguese ambassador, Jo\u00e3o Ramos Pinto, and other local authorities received the soldiers.\nBoth the population and the authorities believe that the presence of the GNR troops, many of whom have also served in Iraq, may be essential to allow the inhabitants of Dili to return to their homes.\nA Portuguese military column then left at the beginning of the afternoon, from Baucau to Dili, transporting the 120 soldiers and an medical team of Portugal's National Medical Emergency Institute, INEM. Now in Dili, the Portuguese contingent's main objectives will be to provide security in the city and its suburbs, and to train Dili's police force.\nThe destruction of many public buildings in the last days forced a move of the Portuguese headquarters from a Dili police station to the Dili Hotel 2001, a touristy complex just outside the East Timor's capital. The hotel's gymnasium will be converted to a command post. Some of the other hotel divisions have already a infirmary, set by a INEM team, and a communications center, set by a Portugal Telecom technical team, working.\nAn Antonov An-124 airplane is expected to leave Lisbon next Tuesday with the rest of equipment for the Portuguese force, mainly vehicles, six vans of public order, five jeeps, three pickup trucks, and six armoured vehicles, like those used in Iraq by the Republican National Guard.\nUnlike the troops from New Zealand and Malaysia, who are under the direct command of the Australians, Portugal refused to put its troops under Australian command. This decision was announced by Portugal's Foreign Minister, Diogo Freitas do Amaral, during a news conference in Lisbon this Friday. Freitas do Amaral added that early that day a meeting was held between him, an Australian General, and a second unidentified person.\nThe Australian mission \"was expressly sent from London to Lisbon to ask for clarifications\" to a agreement that was signed last Thursday (June 1) in Dili, between Portugal and East Timor, reaffirming that the GNR group has its own operational command.\nJos\u00e9 Ramos Horta told Lusa News Agency that the soldiers of the GNR \"have to start acting with autonomy and hardness\" in the entire city, Dili, to reestablish the law and order. The Foreign Minister also told the Agency that he \"respects\" the decision of the Portuguese government to put the GNR force out of the Australian command of the international force, affirming that is essential to reach an agreement this Monday, so that the Portuguese Republican National Guard \"can be operational.\"\nRamos Horta added that this would be the position that he will defend in a meeting this Thursday morning with the diplomats of Australia, Portugal, New Zealand and Malaysia. This meeting will define the way that the forces of the four countries will work on the country, having the troops of Australia, New Zealand and Malaysia working under a single Australian command, and the Portuguese force working in an \"autonomous\" way and reporting directly to President Xanana Gusm\u00e3o.\nThe East Timorese Minister, guarded by Australian elite soldiers, and travelling in a civilian car, heard complaints about the lack of protection given by the 1.300 Australian soldiers already at the city, while saying \"that is obvious that there's a arousing frustration of the population before the apparent impunity with those groups that continue to destroy\".\nThe Portuguese military are in East Timor in response to a request of help made by the East Timor authorities to Australia, Portugal, New Zealand, and Malaysia. This is the second time that the special operations team of the GNR has been to this former Portuguese colony, after being in East Timor between February, 2000 and June, 2002."}

The operation could be \"equivalent if not superior\" to the current transplanting methods, doctors said. The method has only been performed two other times, in Germany.\nUsually hearts would be injected with potassium, which stopped the heart from beating, after which it would be covered with ice. This put the heart in \"suspended animation\" but gave doctors only a six-hour window to examine and transplant, doctors said.\n\"Normally the heart is in suspended animation but they still start to deteriorate,\" said Professor Bruce Rosengard, head of the team of doctors who operated on the man.\nThe new method involves connecting the heart to a machine that pumps warm, oxygen enriched blood through the heart.

It also allows them to find a match for whoever may need it.\n\"Once hearts are hooked up to the device, which takes about 20 minutes, any deterioration is fully reversed.

After his disastrous first term, very few would have considered Garcia's comeback to be possible. \nMany in Peru did not like Ollanta Humala's relationship with Venezuelan president Hugo Chavez whom they felt was interfering with Peruvian affairs.

Selwyn has been charged under section 81(1)(c) of the New Zealand Crimes Act 1961, which forbids any such publication which means \"[t]o incite, procure, or encourage violence, lawlessness, or disorder\".

Blogger Idiot/Savant, who has extensively researched the history of sedition in New Zealand, called the law \"an archaic holdover from feudalism, which should have been relegated to the dustbin of history long ago.\" Blogger Lewis Holden, stated \"Allowing the state to prosecute an individual for publishing an idea is morally abhorrent and wrong. The state should not have such a power at its disposal: to do so invites abuse of our right to freedom of speech.\" \nAt the time of the attack, Prime Minister Helen Clark said \"This is violent criminal behaviour and there is no place for it in a democracy...\".\nThe Crown says to find him guilty the jury must decide if the pamphlets encouraged other New Zealanders to break the law through similar crimes, and whether Selwyn knew that is what the material set out to do."}

Proponents of the projects say Gorgon is one of Australia's biggest export ventures, scheduled to provide up to 6,000 jobs and exports of up to $1.2 billion.\nEPA chairman Dr Wally Cox said the Gorgon project operators (Chevron, ExxonMobil, and Shell), had made an effort on flora and fauna issues but in its present state, the Gorgon proposal was \"unacceptable.\" Gorgon LNG general manager Colin Beckett said that Gorgon was a world-class gas field and that the joint venture partners were confident that the decision would be reversed.\nEnvironment Minister Mark McGowan said there was a definite process to be followed. The Minister says he will make a final decision on the Gorgon proposal after considering the EPA report - and any subsequent report from the Appeals Convenor. The EPA recommendations on the Gorgon proposal are subject to a two-week appeals period.\nThe EPA's Dr Cox said that joint venture had \"not been able to demonstrate that impacts from dredging, the introduction of non-indigenous species and the potential loss of fauna could be reduced to acceptable levels.\"\nIn September 2003 the WA government provided \"in-principle agreement\" to the Gorgon joint venturers subject to a number of conditions. Dr Cox said that the Environmental Review and Management Programme had further highlighted the terrestrial and marine conservation values of Barrow Island and the adjacent waters.\n\"Flatback turtles in particular would be put at risk from the proposal with two of the most important nesting beaches located adjacent to the proposed LNG processing plant site and the materials off-loading facility,\" Dr Cox said. \"There is very little science available on the life-cycle, behaviour and feeding habits of Flatback turtles and as a consequence it is not possible at this time to identify management measures that would ensure ongoing survival of this Pilbara Flatback turtle population.\"\nDr Cox also said that the Proponent had not been able to demonstrate that risk could be reduced to satisfactory levels in the areas of: Impacts on the marine ecosystem from dredging; The introduction of non-indigenous species; Potential loss of subterranean and short range endemic invertebrate fauna species. \"As a result, the proposal in its present form cannot meet the EPA's environmental objectives and is considered environmentally unacceptable,\" Dr Cox said.\nGovernment/Industry Support.\nDespite the EPA's decision to block the proposal, the Australian newspaper reports that WA Premier Alan Carpenter was prepared to overrule the EPA's advice: \"While he stopped short of providing a guarantee the project would go ahead, Mr Carpenter said it involved \"massive economic and social benefit\" for the state.\" \nThe Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association (APPEA), has welcomed the bi-partisan support by the Premier, and the Leader of the Opposition, Paul Omodei, to the Gorgon project. APPEA's Chief Executive, Belinda Robinson, said. \"It also involves the world's first commercial carbon sequestration project. It's hard to imagine what more could be done,\" Ms Robinson said.\n\"The Gorgon project is a world class gas resource of more than 40 trillion cubic feet, and its development has the potential to deliver 6,000 jobs, $2.5 billion in annual export income, and more than $17 billion in government taxes and royalties over its 60 year life,\" Ms Robinson said.\nThe Gorgon project proposal involves a two-train, 10 million metric-ton-per-year liquefied natural gas (LNG) plant and a domestic gas plant on Barrow Island, located off Australia's northwest coast. Home to Australia's largest operating onshore oil field for the past 40 years, the island is also a Class A nature reserve.\nHowever, the Greens applauded the WA EPA's advice. Greens Senator Rachel Siewert said in a media release: \"This is the second time the WA EPA has knocked back this proposal. The proponents should review their options to put the project on the mainland, which will ultimately be a win for the regional economy and a win for the unique environment of Barrow Island.\"\n\"This is a proposal that should always have been located on the mainland. Proposing to build something on this scale inside Australia's most precious island nature reserve was deeply flawed from the beginning,\" said Senator Siewert. \"The island has been dubbed 'Australia's Ark' for its unique cargo of endangered species, many of them now extinct or endangered on mainland Australia. He must take strong action to look after the island.\""}

The Federal Reserve often lower interest rates to finance the economy but in an inflationary economy interest rates might also need to rise.

The taskforce is to investigate:\nThe taskforce.\nMr Howard said the taskforce will be led by former Telstra CEO and nuclear physicist, Dr Ziggy Switkowski and will include five other members. In a statement, Mr Howard announced two of the five additional members. One of Australia's foremost nuclear researchers, Professor George Dracoulis from the Australian National University and economist Professor Warwick McKibbin, a board member of the Reserve Bank of Australia.\nThe Prime Minister said that he would announce the other three members today, after they confirm their availability.\nDr. Jim Peacock, Australia\u2019s Chief Scientist, will assist the review process.\nMr Howard said that Australia should investigate the potential to capitalise on its vast uranium reserves. He said Australia had 40 percent of the world's known uranium reserves, and Australia could \"increase and add value to our uranium extraction and exports\".\nThe Prime Minister told reporters that nuclear energy is not something that will happen in the short term in Australia, but may occur in the long term. \"I don\u2019t expect to have nuclear power stations in Australia within the next two or three years,\" he said.\n\"I do think, however, that we need in an open-minded and as emotionless fashion possible, to have a serious debate about this issue.\" Mr Howard said.\nMr Howard said that it is \"foolish\" for Australia to remain solely as an exporter of uranium given the vast amounts of the mineral the country has.\nThe opposition has been calling on the Howard government to name possible locations for nuclear power stations since announcing that they wish to investigate the use of nuclear energy. Mr Howard told reporters that it the plants would be built by private enterprise and those calls on the government were \"putting the cart before the horse\".\nMr Howard said that his government expected the opposition to run a \"fear campaign\" on the issue and that he would not be deterred, as he believes the public's opinion on nuclear energy has shifted significantly. He said that he wanted a full and open review, examination and debate.\nCriticism.\nDuring his press conference on Tuesday, Mr Howard was asked if the taskforce had been weighted to come up with a favourable report as the members announced so far were pro-nuclear. Mr Howard denied the claim saying that members had been selected who knew the subject and were \"open-minded and clear headed\".\nClaims of a conflict of interest with Ziggy Switkowski have begun to surface after it was revealed that he is a board member of the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation, which runs Australia's only nuclear reactors in Lucas Heights, south of Sydney. Mr Howard, speaking on ABC Television defended the claims saying \"He's a nuclear physicist Ziggy Switkowski, he's a proven person in the commercial area, he's got strong public administration skills, that's a good combination for something like this\".\nIn order to minimise the conflict of interest, Switkowski resigned from the board of ANSTO on June 7 2006."}

As tyres are the only part of a vehicle in contact with the road, they affect acceleration, braking and cornering.\nAs well as the safety issues associated with driving a vehicle with a worn tyre, drivers can be fined for \"driving an unsafe vehicle\" and fined AUD$171, in addition police may \"defect\" the vehicle, restricting its use until repaired. Victorian law requires that tyres have a minimum tread depth of 1.6mm.\nWikinews investigated the average price of each tyre on a typical large and small Australian sedan, and SUV and found the cost to be AUD$129, AUD$105, and AUD$191 respectively."}

It is famous for its seafood, especially crabs and oysters. However, in the last century, the bay's oyster population has been in steady decline.\nFor hundreds of years, watermen of the Chesapeake Bay have made a living by harvesting oysters. In the last 50 years, the number of oysters has declined dramatically.\nTommy Leggett is an Oyster Restoration and Fisheries scientist with the Chesapeake Bay Foundation, an environmental organization that works to protect the bay's resources. \"Our population is down to one to three percent of historical levels. So, consequently our bay's water quality is down,\" Leggett said.\nGraham Blake grew up on Sarah Creek, a tributary to the bay. His father and grandfather made a good living as watermen by harvesting, transplanting, fattening, and then re-harvesting oysters from the creek. \nIt was an early form of oyster farming. In the 1940s and \u201850s his family could harvest 200 to 300 bushels of oysters each day. Blake says those days are long-gone.\n\"There is none of it like my father made his living, that is non-existent. Some are still trying to make a living on the water, oystering and crabbing and so forth,\u201d Blake said. \u201cThey have got to do a lot of things. They can't just do it in one industry anymore.\"\nIn the late 1950s, parasites, which were introduced from foreign oysters, began to kill the Chesapeake Bay oyster population.\nGraham and Tommy are now stocking the creek bed with hundreds of thousands of disease resistant young oysters. When they reach adulthood, they are transplanted to state sanctuary reefs in the bay.\n\"Since 2000 we have been attempting to grow about a million oysters a year as brood stock to be placed on state sanctuary reefs to help jump start rivers,\u201d Leggett said. \u201cTo date, we have produced about five million oysters that we have transplanted onto a number of reefs in the Virginia portion of the Chesapeake Bay.\" \nThe project seems to demonstrate that watermen and other entrepreneurs can grow oysters in the bay using aquaculture techniques.\n\"We have pretty well demonstrated it, and over a number of years we have had industry people come out to the site. There have been a number of people who have scaled up and are growing more oysters than we are now,\u201d Leggett said. \u201cOyster farming in the bay is just getting ready to take off.\"\nAccording to Leggett, the number of commercial operations growing oysters on the bay will dramatically increase in the next several years. His primary goal is to restore the natural oyster population to what it once was, but it is a goal he says may not happen in his lifetime.\n\"We are just learning some of the pitfalls and the roadblocks that we are going to encounter. We try and learn from our mistakes and change the way we do things,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will happen in time. It's not going to happen in the short term.\""}

A New Zealand police team also arrived yesterday from Auckland to negotiate their possible contributions towards policing. In addition to these police forces, the international force includes more than 2,000 Australian, New Zealand and Malaysian soldiers."}

The death of al-Zarqawi seems to have been interpreted by the market as good news for the future supply of oil from the region.\nThis is against the backdrop in 2006 when the price of oil had reached a record high of $70 a barrel.\nToday on the New York Mercantile Exchange light crude futures for July dropped from over $70 a barrel to a low of $69.54 before rising to $69.63 for a $1.19 loss. \"There's less of a terror threat in Iraq now,\" said Naohiro Niimura, vice president of energy derivatives at Mizuho Corporate Bank Ltd, in Tokyo, who gave his reason for the fall.\nIraq lies over one-third of known oil reserves but since the Iraq war in 2003 has been unable to pump more than 2 million barrels a day - 1 million less than prior to the coalition invasion. In May exports were said to be 1.5 million bpd.\nThe line on a graph that plotted oil price had done a steady incline over recent years, though many factors are involved in the price of a barrel of oil so it is almost impossible to say how much the troubles in Iraq contributed to this rise. \nIraq's exports make up the largest proportion of its Gross Domestic Product and a significant proportion of world supply. Investors were said to have been worried about developing in the country citing lack of security and legal protection.\nAl-Zarqawi, known for videotaped beheadings, suicide bombing campaigns against coalition forces and civilians and reportedly some attacks on oil infrastructure inside Iraq, had claimed responsibility for bombing three hotels in Amman, Jordan. It was hoped the death of Osama bin Laden's operative in Iraq would remove a man who had opposed the US-backed Shiite-led state and western influence in the wider-region. \nThe Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri Maliki's recent appointment of new security and home affairs ministers also may have affected the oil market. Director general of marketing and economics at the Iraqi oil ministry said both pieces of news together were \"a positive indicator for security,\" said Shamkhi Faraj. \nOther voices sounded a note of caution against the optimism: \"The situation in Iraq has now become so chaotic, that it transcends the death of one man, influential as al-Zarqawi was,\" said Edward Meir.\nThe analyst at Man Financial believes the threat to the Iraqi oil industry is political as well as physical.\n\"Yes, al Qaeda attacked oil installations but they were not the only actors and they were not the main actors,\" he said. \"There is also a new factor -- political parties that are using threats against oil to gain leverage.\"\nIn an announcement about oil, Thursday, Deputy Prime Minister Barham Salih of the Iraqi government said it hoped to produce 4.3 million bpd in four years."}

The drug is known as a maturation inhibitor, which is a new group of drugs. Its purpose is to break down the protective protein coating of HIV. The drug exposes the inner genetic material by making holes in the coating of the virus essentially causing it to break down and disabling its ability to be passed from one human to the next. The drug also shows that it works on strains of HIV that are resistant to other medications. The drug is also compatible with other HIV drugs.\n\"It's a truly novel new class of drugs, and I really support their development. If PA-457 turns out to be non-toxic, easy to use and not to select for resistance, it will find good use,\" said Charles Boucher who researches HIV at Utrecht university medical center in the Netherlands.\n\"It stops the virus by interfering in one of the final stages in its assembly and stops it from 'budding out' from the wall of a cell,\" said Alcorn.\nScientists are expected to begin a larger scale test on 48 people in one month, whose drugs are no longer working; however, the drug itself is not likely to be available for wide-scale use for at least 3 years. Test subjects will be administered either a placebo or PA-457 that will be taken in combination with the medication they already take.\n\"This provides the basis for future studies that will be designed to provide a detailed understanding of the interaction between PA-457 and its target as well as insights into the design of new generations of maturation inhibitors,\" said CEO of Panacos Pharmaceuticals, Graham Allaway.\nAt least 80% of those suffering from the disease have shown resistance to other medications."}

William Caldwell said of the investigators.\nThe US search for the Sheikh included the use of remote controlled aircraft, it was revealed.\nHowever; it is said neither the al-Karbuli information nor the al-Zarqawi betrayer lead the Americans to press the fire button on al-Zarwaqi's two-story home. Al-Zarqawi was hard to catch because he reportedly eschewed trackable cell-phones in favour of high-tech Thuraya-made satellite phones to communicate.\nThe death certificate was signed by the secret informant who said both Sheikh Abu Abdul-Rahman and al-Zarqawi would be in Hibhid, Wednesday night. \nFor the elusive insurgent who had previously escaped attempts to bomb him, the execution came after comparison of this source's information with tracks of the location of satellite phone users. \nThe location found was beside a property with a courtyard surrounded by fields away from other buildings. It appears then the US command made the decision to strike at an address in the small town, near Baqubah.\nUS special forces were on the scene to photograph the dead al-Zarqawi at 6:17 p.m., two minutes after two 500lb bombs were dropped. Al-Zarqawi was said to be alive and being given medical assistance when he died of wounds sustained in the bombing.\nThe announcement of the killing was made Thursday by Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri Maliki. Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki said to viewers of Iraqi television the $25 million bounty for information leading to the death or capture of al-Zarqawi would be \"honored.\""}

Proponents hope it would lower the price of high-speed Internet for consumer by enabling Internet service providers to bundle phone, data, video and mobile phone services. The act is the first major telecommunications bill to come before Congress in over a decade, and it passed by 321-101 vote on Thursday.\nPortions of the \"Net Neutrality\" amendment to the COPE Act sought to assure that communication companies who provide Internet services treated all data delivery passing through their connections equally. It specified that each broadband provider has the duty \"not to block, impair, degrade, discriminate against, or interfere with the ability of any person to use a broadband connection to access, use, send, receive, or offer lawful content, applications, or services over the Internet.\" The amendment's passage would have prevented AT&amp;T, Verizon, Comcast and other broadband providers from charging content providers like Google, Yahoo, Amazon or eBay for priority access to their networks. Democrats were largely in favour of the legislation with 140 Ayes and 58 Noes, whereas only 11 Republicans voted for the measure, with 211 against.\nHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi argued that \"The imposition of additional fees for Internet content providers would unduly burden Web-based small businesses and start-ups,\" and that \"They would also hamper communications by noncommercial users, those using religious speech, promoting civic involvement and exercising First Amendment freedoms.\"\nThe phone companies and their Congressional allies argued that the restrictions in the amendment would discourage investment in upgrading networks.

The bill is due to be discussed next in the Senate, where lobbying efforts from both sides are expected to intensify. The White House said that it supports the current bill. "}

Mr Beazley said such a plan has no place for individual Australian Workplace Agreements (AWA).\n\"I believe AWAs are nothing more than a means to cut wages, cut conditions, undermine decency and fairness in our workplaces,\" he said.\n\"So today delegates I announce that a Beazley Labor government will abolish John Howard's Australian Workplace Agreements.\"\nThe opposition leader told his party faithful that AWAs can not be fixed. \"I know AWAs can't be fixed, they can't be made good, they must be rejected,\" said Mr Beazley.\nMr Beazley said a government under his leadership would reward hard work and effort.\n\"The government I lead will be guided by one core principle - when you put in, you get back,\" he said.\n\"That's my pact with middle Australia. When Australian workers put in a good day's work they'll get job security, decent wages, decent conditions, decent protections against unfair dismissal.\" \nThe announcement comes as the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) launches its multi-million dollar advertisement campaign against the government's changes. The unions say their ads portray the stories of real Australians who have been affected by the government's industrial relations reforms.\nACTU leader Greg Combet welcomed Mr Beazley's proposal, saying they were beneficial for both the ALP and the nation as a whole.\n\"It means that there is a clear choice between the Liberal-National government and the Labor Party on these industrial relations issues at the next election,\" he said.\n\"More important than policy commitments, what Mr Beazley is clearly articulating are labour movement values: fairness, decency, respect for people, dignity in their workplace, the right to be represented, sharing in the economic wealth.\n\"These are all extremely important values that he is articulating and I think it is those values that are going to put Labor in good stead.\"\nMr Combet said that the ALP state conference in NSW showed the amount of support Mr Beazley has within his party, despite recent party in-fighting, leadership speculation and attempts by the government to undermine Mr Beazley's leadership.\nAustralian Prime Minister, John Howard accused Mr Beazley of giving in to union pressure. \"It is clear from Mr Beazley\u2019s AWA rollback plan that the Labor Party will do whatever it takes to make the unions happy, even if it is at the expense of Australian workers,\" he said.\nMr Howard accused Mr Beazley of planning a return to an industrial relations system that left one million Australians without work. Mr Howard also said that Mr Beazley has promised to eliminate AWAs but has failed to put forward a replacement. \"Mr Beazley today proposed that Labor would abandon AWAs but did not outline any replacement for the existing arrangements,\" said Mr Howard.\nIn a statement, Mr Howard said that Mr Beazley had no plan to ensure the continued growth of the Australian economy and accused Mr Beazley and his party of failing to \"take advantage of an increasingly competitive global marketplace\". \nDefending his government's legislation that allows AWAs, Mr Howard said that AWAs give negotiating power to workers. \"AWAs now play an integral role in the nation\u2019s workplace relations culture, with almost one million Australian workers since 1996 enjoying the benefits of making workplace agreements on their terms, \" he said\nThe Prime Minister also dismissed any claims that AWAs have reduced wages and satisfaction of employees. \"AWAs have delivered higher wages, greater productivity and enhanced satisfaction for employees, \" he said."}

The game was another meeting of the 2003 Rugby World Cup finalists, which saw Jonny Wilkinson land a field goal in extra time to win the Rugby World Cup, although the sides have played each other since then, it was the first return to Telstra. In the lead up to the game, England coach Andy Robinson slammed the condition of the pitch of Telstra Stadium. He visited the stadium the day before the test and said he had fears that scrums could be affected by the condition of the pitch. Scrums played a powerful role in the sides last contest at Twickenham last year when the English almost embarrassed the Wallabies with its impressive scrummaging. Since their last clash, John Connolly has been appointed the head coach of Australia, and the game against England will mark his debut. With a new-look team, the Wallabies entered the game having lost eight of its previous nine matches.\nEngland's Olly Barkley kicked off the match, and just three minutes in, Australia was awarded a penalty. Stirling Mortlock's kick is wide of the posts, and the score remains nil-all. England's scrum prospered in the first twenty minutes, and Australia missed a few oppoortunities to score tries. In the 18th minute, England was penalised for not releasing the ball in the tackle. Mortlock was successful with the shot at goal, and Australia moved ahead, 3 points to nil. Just after twenty minutes England looked dangerous as Mike Catt throws a long pass to speedster Tom Varndell near their own goaline, but a stray pass to Tom Voyce led to little. Three minutes later Australia was awarded another penalty, and England found itself a little further behind on the scoreboard when Mortlock was successful with another penalty kick. Shortly after Iain Balshaw goes in for England off a Barkley kick, but being wrapped up by Australian captain George Gregan, the television match official ruled a no try. After an unsuccessful scrum on the Australian scoreline, Barkley misses a penalty kick just left to the posts. English captain Pat Sanderson makes an optimistic break shortly after though a pass is intercepted. Mortlock misses a penalty goal soon after, but on the stroke of half time he kicks another penalty goal to put Australia nine points in front as the game goes sinto half time.\nBarkley got England's first points a few minutes into the second half, being successful with a penalty kick, taking the game to nine to three, with Australia still in front. Though shortly after Barkley is penalised for not releasing the ball, and Mortlock kicks a penalty goal to take Australia's lead to 12 points. Australian fullback Chris Latham scores the first try of the match in the 54th minute, with Mortlock's conversion, Australias takes a convincing 19 to 3 lead over the English. Australia furthered its lead to 22 points as Mortlock lands another penalty goal, with under 15 minutes remaining in the game, an English comeback seemed unlikely. Australia sealed the victory when Clyde Rathbone makes a break up field and passes to Mark Gerrard who regathers his own kick to score a try.

Once we change that, the terrorists win,\" he said.\nLeader of the Australian Greens Bob Brown says that the failure to consider security implications associated with nuclear power generation is \"daft\".\nSenator Brown accused the government of failing to consider the possibility of nuclear material becoming available to terrorists. \"It's daft to say the least and it's really pig-ignorant of the dangers of nuclear material coming into the hands of terrorists,\" he said.\nSenator Brown said he is concerned that the move encourages Indonesia, a country that he claims to have a terrorist problem to build nuclear reactors. \"The Government doesn't understand that their paving the way for nuclear enrichment or reactors in Australia encourages Indonesia, which has plans for up to 12 nuclear reactors and which the Government knows has real problems with terrorism.\"\nThe Greens leader said that there is a possibility a nuclear reactor could become a terrorist target. \"It does make the threat of terrorists getting nuclear materials or targeting a reactor real, and it must be a consideration for any inquiry,\" he said.\nThe opposition has also raised concerns about security risks associated with nuclear energy. Stephen Smith said, \"We don't think that the economics are there for nuclear power stations in Australia, let alone the national security risks that go with that and the waste disposal risks that go with that.\""}

The goal Robben scored, enough to win the game for his side, was tucked away in a one-on-one with Dragoslav Jervic after he had out-sprinted the defence to reach a through ball.\nIn the second half Marco Van Basten's team seemed to suffer with the heat as opposition got more offensive play; but a goal for Serbia and Montenegro did not look likely.\nSerbia and Montenegro gave up 60 percent of the ball possession to the Netherlands, which also restricted the Balkan's team to just four shots on target.\nAnd with its accurate passes, skill and pace the team, known as the \"Orange men\" for the colour of their kit, still threatened. In the second half Robin Van Persie's free kick was driven low across the goal and missed the far post, as well as Holland's forwards, by centimeters.\nThe match was decided by a single goal partly because it was tightly contested in midfield; of the six yellow cards issued by German referee Markus Merk, they all went to defenders and midfield players.\nRobben's individual display, which included a moment when he evaded two opposition players only for his shot to be blocked, earned him the man of the match award from Fifa's technical study group. He was the bright spark that exposed Serbia and Montenegro's lack of pace in defence. \nIlija Petkovic's team did not create enough goal-scoring chances and might think to beat Ivory Coast and Argentina, the two other teams in Group C, they need to work on the attack game.\nStatistics.\nGroup C\nAttendance: 37'216\nReferee: Markus Merk (Germany)"}

Then the Mexican coach Ricardo La Volpe, who was observed smoking a cigarette during the game, made two substitutions at half time. This seemed to change the game.\nShifting from three to two forwards, in the second half the Central Americans won the ball more often in midfield; they then piled pressure on the Iranian goal with an effective short passing game. Iran failed to adequately adapt to this tactical change.\nWith 15 minutes remaining an Iranian defensive error led to the game-winning goal, and a great flowing move four minutes later made the result look convincing for Mexico.\nThe Mexican team did lose experienced striker Jared Borgetti to what seemed to be a leg muscle injury on 46 minutes. This will be a concern to the coach. But the majestic performance of captain Rafael Marquez, who seemed to be nearly everywhere, ensured onfield leadership was unaffected.\nHis team had to wait a while for the go-ahead goal. On 75 minutes Ebrahim Mirzapour's clearance fell short; his centre back then failed to control the ball and Omar Bravo was put through to slide the ball in for his second goal. In the first half Bravo had deflected a Guillermo Franco header into the net for his first. \nIran, in all red kit, had a good first period but was out-played in the second.

With attacking stars Figo, Ronaldo and Pauleta, they lined up against an Angolan team who made their first appearance at the World Cup in the Rhein Energie Stadion.\nBut a score of 6-0 or 5-1 - the scores of the two times the teams had played in their recent fixtures - was not to be. And, in a defensive move, on 61 minutes Ronaldo, was pulled off by Portugal's Brazilian coach Luis Felipe Scolari. \nRonaldo in the first half had a header that hit the Angolan crossbar but it might be the yellow card the gifted 20-year-old had received which prompted the move to rest the player.\nAngola did not make the game easy but when it seemed the Portugal coach was content with his side to defend the lead against the former Portugal colony some in the crowed jeered loud enough to be heard on television.\nThis would be no disrespect to Figo who was on exceptional form, involved in almost every Portugal attack. Despite the defensive tactics he might have created more goals but for the deep-sitting Angolan defence that made it difficult to get a clear sight of goal. \nAngola, in an apparent attempt to keep the score respectable, kept 11 men in their own half of the pitch for much of the game. In the second half, as the clock ticked, Angola appeared reluctant to attack the Portugal goal in numbers such that Portugal could catch them on the break.\nThe only goal conceded by Luis De Oliveira Goncalves side was the result of the inventive play of Portugal's famous number seven. Figo cleverly knocked the ball around a defender and ran at speed into the penalty box. His run brought Angolan goalkeeper Joao Ricardo toward him, and Figo found Pauleta in the perfect position to pass the ball into the net.\nStatistics.\nGroup D\nAttendance: 45'000\nReferee: Jorge Larrionda (Uruguay)"}

Captain Tsuneyasu Miyamoto looked impressive while goalkeeper Yoshikatsu Kawaguchi made key saves against Australian captain Mark Viduka - including a double one in the first half.\nThe Socceroos might consider themselves unfortunate for the goal they conceded. It was disputed with questions of goalkeeper interference. In any event, on 25 minutes Mark Schwarzer failed to reach a cross looped in from the right; the ball sailed over his head and into the net. \nThe match had good passing, inventive plays; both sides played with three defenders and encouraged attacking football, with much of the play in and around the penalty areas. After second half substitutions, Australia ended the match with three forwards over six feet in height and this may have made the difference.\nBut had Japan scored from a number of good opportunities they made the Australian come back may not have been enough.\nThe equaliser on 84 minutes owed to similar element of luck or goalkeeping error as the first goal. The Japan keeper missed a throw from the left. The ball fell loose to midfielder Tim Cahill, close to the penalty spot. The substitute drove the ball low through the legs of players to score.\nThen the Japanese may feel unfortunate - a minute later Tim Cahill appeared to up-end a Japanese player in his penalty box. No penalty was given; the score remained 1-1.\nZico, the Brazilian manager of the Japanese team who had been minutes from successfully guiding his team to a first game win, then watched as Tim Cahill on 89 minutes scored his second from the top of the semi-circle; with much deftness, he curled the ball in off the right post.

Suspected Islamist militants threw three grenades at a crowded bus station in Jammu city, police said, killing one person and wounding 22. The station is close to a camp where hundreds of pilgrims are staying before embarking on a long journey to Amarnath, a Hindu shrine deep in the Himalayas.\n\"I was about to board a bus when something exploded between some buses,\" said Manoj Kumar, who sustained glass splinter injuries and was admitted to a local hospital. Islamist militants fighting against Indian rule in the disputed region have attacked the annual pilgrimage several times in the past but the last three years have been peaceful. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack.\nIn a violent day in the troubled Himalayan region, a teenage boy was killed in Kupwara district when police fired to disperse Muslim demonstrators protesting against what they believed had been the desecration of a Koran and a mosque, witnesses and police said. Twenty others, including 10 policemen, were injured in the clash 85 km northwest of Srinagar. On Saturday, villagers told journalists that soldiers had entered a mosque wearing shoes and then desecrated a copy of the Islamic holy book.\nA policeman was killed and another wounded as suspected militants fired on a police patrol in Sopore town, north of Srinagar, police said. And unidentified gunmen shot dead seven labourers -- said to be from the Indian state of Bihar -- in Anantnag district in south Kashmir. No group claimed responsibility and the army said it was investigating.\nAccording to Wikipedia, the conflict between Islamist separatists and the military in Jammu and Kashmir has claimed thousands since the early 1990s. The region has long been a source of conflict between India and Pakistan, with both nations claiming sovereignty over it."}

Announcing this, Chief Minister M. Karunanidhi said following the decision, the incremental retail price, inclusive of the sales tax component, would come down from Rs. 2.23 a litre to Rs. 1.78. As a result, the price of diesel, that increased from Rs.33.72 a litre to Rs.35.95 on Tuesday, would come down to Rs. 35.50. But, by foregoing the sales tax of 45 paise a litre, the State Government would lose Rs.180 crore annually. The decision not to increase the fares would result in Rs.100-crore additional burden on the STUs, Mr. Karunanidhi said in a statement.\nHis announcement came after a similar initiative by Maharashtra and a day after Union Petroleum Minister Murli Deora met him in Chennai. A couple of days ago, the Chief Minister had said that any reduction in the sales tax could result in the bus fares going up. In the statement, Mr. Karunanidhi said the rising crude oil prices globally necessitated an increase in fuel prices. It had become routine for the ruling party to explain the circumstances leading to the increase and the Opposition to protest. The upward revision in petrol and diesel prices was being talked about by the Centre for some months now, but was put on hold. The Centre, he said, had little option but to increase the price despite some of the coalition partners opposing the move and even the President of the Indian National Congress (Congress Party) Sonia Gandhi not favouring it. \nWhile a reduction in levies on petroleum products by the Centre and the State Government was a temporary solution, the long-term solution was to reduce consumption of petroleum products and promote research on their alternatives. In a statement, AIADMK General Secretary Jayalalithaa said the State Government could reduce the price burden by reducing the sales tax on petrol and diesel. Noting that it was not her suggestion but what Mr. Karunanidhi had given when she was Chief Minister, she said the Centre had recently said that such a move could reduce the impact of petrol and diesel price increase.

At 25 years and two months Ghana also had the youngest team at the tournament. In the end the team's inexperience showed in the result.\nItaly responded to early Ghanian pressure with forceful passing and aggressive attacks through Luca Toni. At first this effected to keep the fearless Africans, always looking to attack themselves, on the back foot. \nWith Luca Toni Italy always looked dangerous going forward. On 25 minutes he evaded a defender and rasped a shot onto the underside of the crossbar. It missed going over the goaline by just a yard.\nRatomir Dujkovic's side had the best chance to shock the Azzuri after half an hour. Emmanuel Pappoe had space in the box - but skied his attempt over the bar. For some time it seemed goals might go in at both ends, as action was at one end, then another. But with tiredness Ghana lost some discipline in defence and ran out of ideas in attack.\nThe challenge of the two superb Italian defenders, Fabio Cannavaro and Alessandro Nesta, proved too tough. The Italian penalty area was almost impermeable to the white shirts for long stretches.\nGhana found no good opportunities to test Italian goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon partly because Ghana was unable to deliver crosses to target inside the box. Efforts on goal were restricted to shots from outside the box from Michael Essien.\nOnly four out of Ghana's 14 shots were on target. In contrast Italy had 18 shots; 13 were on target. This tells the story of a game in which two teams attacked a lot, but a vastly superior defence won.\nAndrea Pirlo scored the game-winner. On 39 minutes, he received a pass from a corner at the top of the area; in plenty of space, he curled it low and hard into bottom left corner of the net.\nRichard Kingston made a number of good saves to keep the Italians ahead by just the one goal but could not do anything about Samuel Kaffour's error on 83 minutes. Kaffour's back pass was too short and Vincenzo Iaquinta rounded Kingston to score.\nEarlier, as Ghana got desperate, Asamoah Gyan tried something to unlock the Italian defence: a solo run; powering past blue shirts he got as far as the penalty area. Then he appeared to be fouled by Daniele De Rossi; the referee did not blow his whistle.\nMarcelo Lippi, the Italian coach, might feel this game, the second in Group E, was a good work out for the Italians who were just a bit too wise for the Ghana team on this occasion. \nStatistics.\nGroup E\nAttendance: 43'000\nReferee: Simon (Brazil) \nRelated news.\nCzech Republic coast to 3-0 win in Group E"}

The study says that the amount of amyloid proteins in different areas of the brain was reduced, in some cases, up to 50%. In the lowest amounts, the protein was reduced 15.5%. In direct areas of the brain, such as the hippocampus and cerebral cortex, the reduction of the protein was 40-50%. Amyloid proteins, when over produced, are believed to cause the symptoms of the illness by forming masses in the brain, which spread. The vaccine involves injecting the mice with the protein and then the DNA vaccine. The vaccine codes itself to the protein, stopping the spread of the masses by not allowing the protein to reproduce.\n\"DNA vaccines are given by intramuscular injection, which stimulates the production of anti-amyloid-beta antibodies. In the early stage, we highly expect that DNA vaccination will prevent disease progression and, hopefully, normalize brain function,\" said Matsumoto.\nHowever, Matsumoto also said that patients who are experiencing \"advanced cases\" of the illness will have \"irreversible damage\" even if they received the vaccine.\n\"In advanced cases, however, neuronal loss and brain atrophy are very severe and irreversible. So it may be difficult to obtain clinical improvement with DNA vaccination,\" said Matsumoto.\nIn 2003 18 of the 298 people testing the vaccine had symptoms of brain swelling and the trials were stopped. At least 6% of those testing the vaccine had an over-reaction, which caused swelling of the brain and some even suffered brain damage.\nResearchers say the new development is \"safe\" but that it will be \"years\" before any real and extensive clinical tests of the vaccine begin.\n\"Any of these vaccines could prove safe and effective. But we are years away from seeing them widely used in clinical practice -- but perhaps as few as three years away,\" said chairman of the Alzheimer's Association's Medical and Scientific Advisory Council, Dr. Sam Gandy.\n\"The findings support the idea that a vaccine is our best hope for fighting this devastating disease for which there is currently no cure,\" said Doctor Susanne Sorensen, of the Alzheimer's Society."}

With the snow-roof closed for television conditions approached something like a sauna.\nThe goal for Otto Pfister's side was scored by Kader on 31 minutes. Between two defenders, Kader took a ball delivered from the right wing, which he deflected into the penalty area with his thigh. Kader ran on to the ball and fired low across the keeper; it went in off the right post.\nMohamed Kader arguably was Togo's outstanding player of the match and caused trouble for Korean Republic in the second half with his pacey runs. \nBut a second half substitution and a sending off favoured the 2002 tournament's semi-finalists to stage a come back. \nThe Korean Republic upped the speed of their short passing game and when midfielder Ji Sung Park, 30 yards from goal, turned and beat Jean-Paul Abalo a chance for the equaliser looked on.\nThe Togolese defender hacked down the surging winger Park, who plays his club football for Manchester United. He was given a second booking and sent off. Issued by Graham Poll, this was the second red card of the 2006 World Cup in Germany. \nThe goal came direct from the freekick; on 54 minutes Chun Soo Lee used his right foot to send the ball with pace and bend beyond Kossi Agassa.\nWith the Korea Republic playing against 10 men the game opened up. But Togo, though it had just 36 per cent of ball possession in the game, was not a push over. The West African team mounted a number of dangerous counterattacks.\nOn 63 minutes the energetic Moustapha Salifou was in space on the edge of the area but could not keep his shot down.\nSeven minutes later Dick Advocat's half time substitute, veteran Jung Hwan Ahn, added another Korean example to the textbook of how to shoot from long range. Wider to the right than Chun Soo Lee's the 30-year-old drove it over Agassa into the same right corner.\nThe Korea Republic came into the tournament on bad form, which included a 3-1 loss to Ghana. But to beat Togo Dick Advocat's side had to improve during the match, which might give them confidence against France and Switzerland, also in Group G. \nStatistics.\nGroup G\nAttendance: 48'000\nReferee: Graham Poll (England) "}

French star players Zinedine Zidane, Patrick Viera and Thierry Henry looked slow and indecisive and failed to dictate the game.\nIn the first half the French had the better chances with Thierry Henry getting in good positions. But it was the Swiss who came closest to scoring after 25 minutes. \nFrom a set-play, Alexander Frei chipped the ball towards goal; the ball missed everyone and hit Fabian Barthez's left post. Liliam Thuram was first to the rebound.\nSwitzerland, while playing a strong defensive game, had more chances to get the ball into Barthez's net in the second half. Daniel Gygax's downward header from five yards brought a brilliant leg save from the French keeper.\nFor the French the second half continued as the first: Zidane was not as influential as the French might have wished, Viera was not aggressive and Henry did not show the creative flair he had done during the season for his club side, Arsenal.\nAn 84th minute substitute Vikash Dhorasoo, 10 yards out to the left of Pascal Zuberbuehler's goal, had the best French chance in the match but his shot skewed wide.\nPhilippe Senderos, the 21-year-old Swiss central defender, was arguably the best player on the pitch for Switzerland coach Koebi Kuhn. However; moments from the final whistle the Swiss might have had another hero. \nA free kick to the left of Barthez's penalty area was whipped across goal for Swiss runners.

But the team with red and white chequers did not use their 50 per cent of possession to create many clear openings, nor did they capitalise on Brazilian errors. \nOn 59 minutes Brazil's defence had a lapse in concentration: a misplaced pass between the back three nearly allowed the quick Croatian substitute Ivica Olic a chance on goal. The advantage came to nothing as the defence recovered. \nThe best Croatian chance fell to Niko Kranjcar, minutes from the end. When the cross came into the box the midfielder was unmarked - but his header went far over the bar.\nThe Croatian manager, Zlatko Kranjcar might consider a one-goal loss a good result against the reigning champions.

Spain's superb form showed in a great understanding between players with passes meeting runs all over the pitch.\nAfter four minutes Ukraine's long free kick from the left touchline found Vladimir Yezerskiy, but he could not direct his header toward goal.

Korea] is moving in that direction, yet we cannot rule out the possibility that at the last moment it will change its mind.\" He also said that the preparations could be \"quite worrisome\", but also said that the U.S. and other nations should not \"make a conclusion\" that N. Korea will test the missile.\n\"CNN\" quoted an anonymous U.S. intelligence official as saying, \"[N. Korea] is doing everything you would expect if you are going to launch a missile. There is reason to think they are doing it for show.\"\nAccording to Alexander Vershbow, the US ambassador to , the U.S. will respond to the test of the missile with \"appropriate measures.\"\nN. Korea last tested a short-range missile in 1998 which shot over Japan's mainland and landed into the . This will be N. Korea's first long-range test since the nation imposed a \"moratorium\" in 1999. According to Tae-sik, N. Korea may be abandoning the moratorium in a move to pressure the U.S. into making diplomatic concessions.\nN. Korea is currently refusing to hold talks with the 5 nations because of financial sanctions placed on the nation."}

But a sending off, an incessant German offensive, a couple of strikes against the woodwork and then an injury time winner defeated them. The German fans then cheered the six points that put the team top of Group A. \nThe Polish tackled furiously but in the 75th minute had the extra handicap of having Radoslaw Sobolewski sent off. He tugged Miroslav Klose from behind earning a second yellow card from the Spanish referee.\nIt took until two minutes into injury time for the German team to score the decider. This was not for lack of chances. In the first half Klose, Bastian Schweinsteiger and Lukas Podolski had all failed to get shots on target. \nKlose might have had three goals in the second half; he missed a cross, had a shot saved and, in the 90th minute, hit the crossbar with a header. Michael Ballack smacked the rebound onto the same piece of Artur Boruc's woodwork.\nIf playing 10-men helped Klinsmann's team so did his substitutions. He removed the young Germans Poldolski and Schweinsteiger. They had appeared inhibited by the aggressive Polish defence. \nOf the three substitutions made, two would combine to score the winner: the experienced Neuville and young sprinter David Odonkor. On 92 minutes Ondonkor was sent down the right wing. He crossed and the ball was met on the bounce by Neuville in front of Artur Boruc.\nPawel Janas's side did not have many chances. On 27 minutes Ireneusz Jelen had an opportunity to set up a goal but chose to shoot. In the second half his long range shot did not trouble Jens Lehmann. Poland now need Costa Rica to take three points from Ecuador on June 15, to have any chance to progress in this competition. \nThe German team were always dominant in and around the Polish penalty area. They had 58 per cent of ball possession, three times as many shots on goal and six more corner kicks as the Poland side. One reason why was left-back Philipp Lahm; this right-footed player was Fifa's man of the match.\nHis brilliant movement and passes created chances for the German strikers. Lahm got forward even more in the second half after Sobolewski's sending off; and when Odonkor was brought on to run down the other wing it seemed only a matter of time before one of the combination cracked the Polish defence. \nStatistics.\nGroup A\nAttendance: 65'000\nReferee: Luis Medina Cantalejo (Spain) \nTable.\n\"Fifa World Cup Group A table June 14, 2006\""}

The protest started when some detainees refused breakfast on Wednesday 14th June 2006. A letter from the hunger strikers explaining why they are seeking to draw attention to their plight in this way has been reproduced in full below.\nThose detained at the centre are mostly men who have sought asylum in the UK and whose asylum applications have been rejected. These people are then held without knowing how long they will be detained for - some end up being held for many years while awaiting deportation. \nThe removal centre, known as Campsfield, or Campsfield House is approximately 5 miles north of Oxford and has been in operation since 1993. It was managed on behalf of the UK Government by Global Solutions Limited, until may 2006 when it was taken on by GEO UK, the centre has a capacity of 198. Only males are detained at Campsfield. \nAccording to the campaign group Barbed Wire Britain Over 2,600 individuals, mostly asylum seekers, are detained indefinitely in the UK without trial and with no automatic right to bail. \nThere have been reports in the UK press of the state taking people to detention centres without notice, in the early hours of the morning using excessively heavy handed tactics, taking children out of schools and separating families. \nMany UK people and politicians express their disgust at the way detainees are treated, yet it continues. Perhaps this action by the detainees themselves will further highlight their plight and result in more UK electors writing to their MPs and demanding improvements to the way in which rejected asylum seekers are treated. \n\"We are detainees at Campsfield removal centre in Oxford. Most of us have been here for a long while now. There are people who have been detained for up to two years and down to three months. We are cramped in here like animals. We are treated like animals and moved around different detention centres like animals. The immigration service have taken husbands from their families and taken people who ran away from persecution in their various countries, and dumped everyone in here.\nOnce you are put in here the immigration service forget you. There are detainees who have applied to go back to their own countries that are still being held here for months without any news about their cases, just so that the private security companies get more money.\nDetainees are asked to seek asylum and then refused. The immigration service also ask detainees to apply for bail. When you get a bail hearing date all of a sudden they serve you with removal papers that are not valid. There are many of these situations. In most cases the immigration service don't take you to your court hearings. And then they tell the judges you refused to turn up, just so the hearing goes ahead in your absence. Many detainees have been served with removal papers and travel documents but nothing happens on the removal day.\nCampsfield has become a slave house. We detainees are treated like slaves, to do odd jobs for officers. Detainees are handcuffed to see doctors or dentists in hospitals or clinic appointments. We have some racist security officers who make racist comments to detainees and go out of their way to make you feel like committing suicide. Detainees have to be at the point of death before they get to see the doctors.\nThe food is not worth eating. Even dogs would refuse to eat what we eat. But we don't have a choice; every single day we eat the same food (the food we eat is rice, chicken, sandwiches, and left-over eggs)\".\n=Sources="}

The government considers 3G mobile communications and subscription-based Internet portals to be emerging content services.\nSenator Coonan said in a statement that the government was supportive of new technology, but felt that the technology requires safeguards to ensure that children are not exposed to inappropriate content.\n\u201cThe Government supports the development of innovative new communications services which provide access to the Internet, email, games, instant messaging, chat rooms, video clips and television programs,\u201d she said.\n\u201cHowever, these new content services may also potentially carry offensive or harmful content and we need to ensure that appropriate safeguards are in place to protect children from exposure to content that might be harmful.\u201d\nSenator Coonan said the government intends to prohibit material rated X18+ and restrict access to other services based upon the subscriber's age and content classification. Speaking of the proposed legislation, the minister said \u201cIt will extend the current safeguards that apply to content delivered over the Internet or television to be applied to content delivered over convergent devices,\"\n\u201cThis will include prohibition of content rated X18+ and above, requirements for consumer advice and age-restricting access to content suited only to adults.\u201d\nThe announcement comes as the government released a report into the effectiveness of the current regulatory framework and how it applies to new delivery methods.\nThe report, received by the government in April, found that the differences between television, print, radio and Internet media would be blurred by devices such as 3G mobile phones and wireless Internet access. It suggested that the government regulate based on the amount of control service providers have over content instead of via the method used to access it.\nIt also found that much of the content available via emerging content services was based upon that of other mediums, where censorship already takes place.\nThe report did however express concern about mobile chat services, claiming they could be used by pedophiles to target children. The report found it would be more difficult for parents to supervise their children's mobile chat behaviour as they would have access to the service from anywhere. The report said this could be countered by the fact that mobile users are easier to identify than users on the Internet, making pedophiles less likely to use the service.\nThe report also suggested that Internet access via mobile telephones be limited to customers over the age of 18, unless minors have permission from their parent or guardian. Under current Australian law, a minor is unable to sign up for an account with an Internet service provider, but is able to access WAP based Internet services without restriction."}

Science education professor emeritus, David Redfield and bird watcher, Uthai Treesucon, were able to catch the rodent, but only after failing to do so four times. They returned it to the wild after they took photos and a video of the rodent.\n\"We went to Laos specifically to find this animal. We were extremely fortunate in so many ways to be able to do this. We photographed it with stills and a movie camera. Then we took it back to its habitat and released it. It's easily one of the most gratifying experiences of my life, and I hope these pictures will help in some way to prevent the loss of this marvellous animal,\" said Redfield.\nThe rodent, whose scientific name is \"Laonastes aenigmamus\", is called Laotian rock rat and known to local villagers as 'kha-nyou'. It belongs to the family Diatomyidae. It was photographed in Laos near the village of Doy, in May 2006. The rodent resembles a tree shrew or a squirrel. It walks like a duck and has angled feet that allow it to climb trees. These are the first live photos of the rodent to be taken, but last year, researchers found bodies of the dead animal being sold at local meat markets. The rodent has since been named as a new species.\n\"These images are extremely important scientifically, showing as they do an animal (with) such markedly distinctive anatomical and functional attributes. This is a truly exciting discovery,\" said Mary Dawson , the curator at the Carnegie Museum of Natural History in Pittsburgh, who confirmed the findings.\nThe rodent was able to be officially named after researchers compared bones from fossils of the rodent found in Asia, to bones of a recently found Laotian rock rat. Last summer, a fossil of the same rodent was found in China.\n\"Dr Redfield's sighting of the living animal is the first to be recorded scientifically. These are the first photographic images of the recently discovered 'living fossil' Laonastes aenigmamus,\" said Dawson."}

Lennon came on in place of England's fourth defender as Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson told his men to go for the Socca Warrior's jugular.\nUntil that moment Trinidad and Tobago though not sealed-tight against England's attacks were more able to counter-attack due to the English side's slow play and lack of movement. \nThe Caribbean side had looked especially strong on set plays and long balls floated towards England's goal.\nEngland's goalkeeper Paul Robinson perhaps best showed his side's nerves: he missed three crosses. On two of these occasions Leo Beenhakker's side were inches from taking the lead. In the most dramatic of them, John Terry had to volley a ball off the goalline to stop England going into half-time a goal down to a Stern John header.\nThe Caribbean threat lessened with the substitutions as constant pressure meant Trinidad and Tobago attacker Cornel Glen when he did break was often unassisted. While England's threat increased with Rooney in the centre, and with Lennon and later substitute Stuart Downing who both tested the Socca Warriors from wide positions.\nWith 62 per cent of ball possession the story of England's game was simply the missed opportunities. Trinidad and Tobago was massively overpowered 23 shots to seven.\nOn 43 minutes Peter Crouch had the sort of miss that was so spectacular it may make highlight reels. Unmarked in the centre of the goal it might have been easier to get the ball on target than to skew the volley so far wide.\nHe was not the only culprit.

By chance, this spectacular incident caused three light casualties. Sometime after 15.42, amazed eyewitnesses saw the tram travel 30 metres across the road, then up the sidewalk. It came, at the closest, to around 30 cm from a shop window. The three casualties are suffering from whiplash injuries to the neck and back according to Raymond Wicky, head of the Service d'incendie et de secours (SIS; Fire and Help services). On the other hand, the driver was affected psychologically by the incident, as were several shop owners.\nPsychological assistance has been offered to them. Nine fire engines, two ambulances, and a dozen policemen and cars quickly arrived at the scene. A large security perimeter was placed around the immobilised tram whose length covered half of the road. \nAround a dozen onlookers assisted with the efforts made to move the tram from the road back onto its tracks. A truck then towed it back to its depot, where police and the Swiss Federal department of Transport are to examine the vehicle.\nOnly a few elements that caused the derailment are known: the tram was on a line different to its normal route. Police will investigate whether the tram was travelling too fast, or if it was a faulty switch at the junction, which would have connected the tram to Rue du Stand, and then return it to normal route. Another element is that drivers have the possibility to change the switches in front of them. The inquiry will determine if the driver, wanting to turn here, chose to merge into his normal route and possibly, this caused the incident.\nats/cab"}

What it lacked in flair it made up for in enthralling passion. There were eight yellow cards in this cut and thrust encounter which Sweden edged on the shot counter 17:16. \nIn the end what decided the match was Sweden's speed and ability to get behind Paraguay's defence and shoot from inside the penalty area. Rarely did Paraguay do this. Sweden's captain and centre-back Olof Mellberg had a strong game and may be the reason Andreas Isaksson had only three saves.\nLars Lagerback's half-time decision to take off Zlatan Ibrahimovic for Marcus Allback also seemed to tilt the outcome of the game in Sweden's favour. The striker combined well with Freddie Ljungberg. \nAllback frequently got in good attacking positions and stretched Paraguay's defence to breaking point. But for 43 minutes, after successive near misses it seemed like Paraguay would just contain the Sweden strikers. \nOn 59 minutes Allback ran clear of the Paraguay defence to receive a bouncing ball; he lobbed Aldo Bobadilla and ran around him for the tap in. Unfortunately for Sweden the thing that hit the net was Paraguay's Denis Caniza; who had run at full speed to clear the ball just before Allback got there. \nAllback then had another chance, set up by Larson on the six-yard box. As he swiveled, with the defender behind him, the goal keeper guessed where he was going to shoot. \nThe pace of the game did not relent and the creative movement of the Swedish attacks began to leave Anibal Ruiz's Paraguayans behind. Freddie Ljungberg found more space down the left and was also able to roam across to the right.\nWhen a long ball reached Allback to the left of goal the striker headed across goal. Ljungberg ran in from the right and headed it back across the goalkeeper; one bounce and in. \nBobadilla made 9 saves in the match but this one was a finger tip too far. Sweden after a disappointing scoreless match against Trinidad and Tobago hung on to their World Cup hopes and look set to qualify from the group together with England.\nStatistics.\nGroup B\nAttendance: 72'000\nReferee: Lubos Michel(Slovakia)\nTable.\n\"Fifa World Cup Group B table June 15, 2006\"\nRelated news.\nEngland beat Trinidad and Tobago 2-0 in Group B"}

Bush yesterday signed an executive order declaring the a , creating the largest protected marine area in the world and the largest single conservation area in the history of the United States.\nIn a signing ceremony attended by Hawaii officials, including Hawaii Governor , Bush pledged, \"This region holds the largest and healthiest untouched coral reef system in the United States. And we're going to preserve it.\"\nBush reportedly moved quickly to protect the archipelago after a screening of 's documentary \"Voyage to Kure\" in April. He invoked powers under the Antiquities Act of 1906, which gives the President the power to restrict the use of public land by executive order. The area was under consideration as a National Marine Sanctuary, but Bush's invocation of the Antiquities Act bypasses the yearlong consultation that would be necessary.\nAs a National Monument, the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands would be subject to one of the highest levels of protection in the U.S. All fishing will be phased out over five years, and visitors will require permits for snorkeling and diving. Lingle had enacted similar protections as Hawaii governor, but the protections were limited to a three-mile radius from shore.\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration would manage the monument along with its 13 national marine sanctuaries.\nAdvocates for the fishing industry have raised concerns about the feasibility of further protections, asserting that a small fishery operation in the area would cause little environmental impact. Kitty Simonds of the Western Pacific Regional Fishery Management Council said, \"The President can do whatever he wants to do, but we're disappointed that we can't continue on a small, healthy bottomfish fishery.\"\nEnvironmental groups generally lauded Bush's move.\n\"When you add it all up, it's a world-class ecological jewel. From both a national and global perspective, this really is a landmark conservation event,\" said Joshua Reichert, head of the environment program for the private Pew Charitable Trusts.\nThe preserve, covering all the islands northwest of Niihau, covers 140,000 square miles (360,000 km\u00b2), covering 10 islands and atolls, and stretches for about 1,400 miles (2,200 km).

The incidents come just a week after the Australian government announced an inquiry into the feasibility of nuclear power.\nThe first incident occurred on June 8, when a carbon canister containing radioactive material exploded, blowing out seals in a cell at the Lucas Heights site. The accident is believed to be an explosion in a carbon canister containing radioactive material, which blew the seals out on Hot Cell No 2 in Building 54 releasing small amounts of xenon and krypton into the atmosphere.\nJenny Macklin (Jagajaga, Labor), shadow science minister and deputy leader of the opposition accused science minister Julie Bishop (Curtin, Liberal) of misleading the parliament. Ms Bishop told parliament on Wednesday that \"there was no measurable contamination found outside the immediate area where the incident occurred,\"\nMs Bishop denied there being any radiation threat to the community. \"According to ANSTO, there was absolutely no radiation threat to the health of the workers of ANSTO or the community.\"\nJenny Macklin said in a statement on Wednesday that details of the incident were being hidden. \"The local community deserves to be told what actually happened at the Lucas Heights reactor last Thursday, and why the release of radioactive gases into the atmosphere was not made public,\" said Ms Macklin.\nFollowing Ms Macklin's statement ANSTO said it was \"surprised and disappointed\" at Ms Macklin's comments. ANSTO refuted that it failed to adequately notify the community saying that they released a media statement the day after the incident. ANSTO said that radiation released during the incident was \"so low as not to be directly measurable\". ANSTO said that it could however calculate the amount of radioactive material released and it was a \"very small fraction of the radiation dose received by everyone each year from naturally occurring\nsources of radiation\".\nANSTO assured the public that the releases could not be detected off-site.\nFollowing a statement by the science minister on Thursday that she was unaware of any incidents at ANSTO in the 12 months prior to the latest incidents, the opposition again questioned Ms Bishop's competence. Ms Macklin asked how the minister could not be informed about compliance reports issued by Australia's nuclear regulator ARPANSA that state there were 12 incidents at Lucas Heights in 2005.\nFollowing Ms Macklin's removal from the house, Anthony Albanese (Grayndler, Labor), shadow environment minister questioned Ms Bishop about incidents at ANSTO on Wednesday. According to ANSTO, a worker received a low dose of radiation from Iodine-123 while packaging radiopharmaceuticals. ANSTO claims that the technician received a dose around four per cent of the annual limit for radiation workers and much less than a thyroid cancer patient would receive during a nuclear medicine scan.\nIn a statement, Ms Macklin later accused the science minister of being ill-informed of the incident at Lucas Heights, saying it was concerning the government had an \"incompetent\" science minister at a time when they were \"pushing the benefits of nuclear power\".\nResponding to the opposition's questions during question time in the House of Representatives, the science minister accused the opposition of engaging in a scare campaign to close down a facility that provides \"a medical service for cancer suffers across Australia.\nANSTO has said that the radiation dose received by the technician was so low he did not require medical attention once he had undergone several tests.\nANSTO admitted another two incidents occurred at its Lucas Heights facility on Thursday. The first occurred when a worker who was cleaning a production area burst a package of radioactive material. The second occurred when a worker packing a radiopharmaceutical dropped a small vial. ANSTO said that the amount of radiation received by both workers was extremely low.\nANSTO said that while it is uncommon for two incidents to occur on a single day, it was not uncommon for minor incidents to occur once a month."}

On the pitch the Argentine players provided the flashes of brilliance.\nAn early goal after six minutes was the first of six goals that were the product of almost flawless team play and individual execution. Argentina swept down the left, Maxi Rodriguez ran at speed into a pass and toe-poked first time beyond Dragoslav Jevric.\nThe next one was the climax of a 24 pass move. Esteban Cambiasso tapped the ball forward to Hernan Crespo just inside the penalty area; a back heal and Cambiasso ran on and smacked it past Jevric.\nOn 35 minutes the Argentina fans in the crowd seemed to know which way the game was going. The chant \"Ole\" was heard as the Argentines continued to pass amongst themselves with great ease.\nTotally dominant, the blue and white stripes had over 60 per cent ball possession come half-time. Roberto Abbondanzieri in the Argentina goal was for the most part the spectator number 52'001.\nIt could have been four nil at the break but on 36 minutes Crespo's effort was judged to have come from an offside position. Crespo got booked because he did not stop when the referee blew his whistle. The television replay showed the linesman was mistaken.\nThe third goal came on 41 minutes. Jevric could only palm a Javier Saviola shot to Maxi Rodriguez at the far post who stuck away his second off the post.\nSavo Milosevic won his hundredth cap for Serbia and Montenegro, a statistic that included games with the Yugoslavia football team. He forced a corner with a hard long range shot and failed to reach a header after Danijel Ljuboja had briefly stretched Argentina on the right.\nOn 64 minutes Mateja Kezman appeared to make a frustrated two-footed lunge which caught Javier Mascherano. The referee reached for the red card and made a hard position harder for the unfortunate Serbia and Montenegro team.\nThen it was the Lionel Messi show. The Argentines were comfortable but had not scored in the second half until the 19-year-old Barcelona striker came on after 74 minutes. Soon there were three more goals to the total.\nMessi set up Crespo for a tap in; he burst into the penalty area and a delivered a superb low pass across the goal that beat both the keeper and defenders.\nAnother young Argentine Carlos Tevez got past two half-hearted challenges from the Serbia and Montenegro defence and put the fifth around Jevric. \nThe goal many Argentines in the crowd had waited for came two minutes from time. Messi, recently back from injury, was fed on another burst into the penalty area. He beat Jevric at his near post.\nThis year Montenegro made their split from Serbia official in the political arena. In the Veltins Arena, Friday, the performance of the two national sides combined might be grounds for the coming football divorce.\nThe mathematics of the Group C table mean Jose Pekerman's Argentina are not yet through to the knock-out stage of the Fifa World Cup.

Cmdr. Alfredo Reinado, and his men handed over ammunition and more than a dozen weapons to Australian peacekeepers. The disarming started after a official request of President Xanana Gusm\u00e3o this week.\nThe disarming process requested this week by East Timor's President, Xanana Gusm\u00e3o, started today in Maubisse, as Alfredo Reinado, the leader of the military rebels, handed over his M-16 rifle, with telescopic sight, to an Australian soldier. Followed by him, his men saluted him and handed over their weapons. As Reinado checked that they were unloaded and turned them in to an Australian soldier, that noted down the weapon type and serial number.\nIn this ceremony at a ninteenth century Portuguese village, where Reinado's rebel group camped after fleeing the Timorese capital, Dili in April, Reinado and his men gave up 12 automatic rifles and four pistols. These were then stored at a container guarded by Australian soldiers.\nAfter delivering the weapons Lt. Cmdr. Alfredo Reinado guaranteed in a press conference that he will continue to fulfill the orders of Xanana Gusm\u00e3o.\nRegarding the polemic question about the continuation of the Timorese first Prime Minister, Mari Alkatiri, in power, the Commander clarified that he is a \"military and a Lieutenant Commander on the hierarchy of the Armed Forces\" and that he is only \"fulfilling orders\".\nThe disarming process of the rebels' weapons will be also followed in Gleno, where the remaining rebel troops lead by the Lt. Cmdr. Marcos Tilman and Alves Tara are camped.\nThe start of the process had been announced this Thursday by Marcos Tilman and confirmed by Army Brig. Michael Slater, commander of the Australian-led forces. The announce was made 24 hours after President Xanana Gusm\u00e3o have proclaimed, in message to the Parliament, that the hour for the second phase of the international military forces in the country had arrived. The international military forces, as the second phase starts, will leave Dili into the interior of the country, leaving the Timorese capital in control of the international police forces.\nAccording to Army Brig. Michael Slater, that was speaking to the press in Dili to announce formally the beginning of the disarming process, the international force \"will guarantee protection\" to the rebels, that as of today are disarmed, in way that \"nobody will go to their meeting with aggressive intentions\".\nQuestioned regarding if the delivery of the weapons translates as a surrendering of the military rebels, Mick Slater rejected that classification, pointing out that \"East Timor is not crossing a civil war\".\n\"There's no civil war and nobody is surrendering. There's yes a internal dispute. The important is to create a reliable climate next to the population, taking it to gradually return to its communities\", he added.\nFirst Prime Minister Mari Alkatiri and Timorese Foreign Minister Jos\u00e9 Ramos Horta showed to be satisfied with the delivery of the rebels' weapons.\n\"It's a good start to stabilize the country. I expect that others follow the example\", Alkatiri pointed out.\n\"They have not done harm to anyone and they have pledged they would not involve in violence with their comrades in the defense force,\" Ramos Horta said. \"So that has only boosted their credibility\", he added.\nRegarding the ex-Lieutenant Gast\u00e3o Salsinha, spokesman of the 600 individuals that subscribed an petition denouncing alleged practical discriminatory in the Timorese Armed Forces, Marcos Tilman assured that \"they don't have any weapons\".\nDismissed from the army in March after going on strike to complain of discrimination, the rebels have been hiding in the mountains surrounding Dili, since the start of the violence in the country in the last months.\nBy request of the Timorese authorities, a force of more than 2,000 military and police troops of Australia, New Zealand, Malaysia and Portugal started to arrive at Dili as May 25, 2006, to establish order and peace in the country, after a violence wave have caused the death of more than 2 dozens of people and 130,000 refugees."}

Late in the match Robin van Persie used his chest to stop a Didier Drogba header going over the goal line.\nHenri Michel's side played an attractive passing game but as the game went on this proved ineffective against the wall of orange-shirted Netherlands defenders. A more direct approach might have been better; as the tall, 180 centimeter, forward Didier Drogba showed when Van Persie was forced to clear from a corner.\nEdwin van der Sar, in the Netherlands goal, conceded his first goal for his country since October 2004 but was otherwise safe and did not allow any rebounds from shots. In the second period he was helped by the Netherlands defence who blocked numerous shots from reaching their destination.\nThe best of the entertainment was in the first half. The first goal led from a free kick earned by Van Persie on 22 minutes. Van Persie ran at speed horizonal to the penalty area and was cut down in full flight by Kolo Toure.\nVan Persie took the free kick and hammered the ball left footed around the wall into the net. \nSuddenly Ivory Coast were opened up again three minutes later. Good passes and movement and Arjen Robben found Ruud van Nistelrooij in space to the right of Jean-Jacques Tizie.

Ricardo stretched and the 36 year old goalkeeper, who did not have a football club, clinched the ball like a trophy and earned his team a 0-0 draw. It was Angola's first World Cup point.\nFor a nation where average life expectancy is 38 years this was the biggest result in Angolan football history. The result also meant if Angola beat Iran they still had a mathematical chance to get into the knock-out stage of the Fifa World Cup.\nIn the first half the crowd was subdued as chances were few. Mexico had free kicks saved, one from Rafael Marquez had come off the post. For Angola Figueiredo's free kick found Fabrice Akwa only for the captain's header to go nowhere near the goal.\nThe best chance in free play before the break fell to Mexico's Guillermo Franco. A long ball into box on 44 minutes bounced off a defender but Ricado was in the way of Franco's weak shot.\nRicardo La Volpe had been banned from smoking on the touchline by Fifa after being observed doing so in his first game. Against Iran the Mexican coach was credited with a change in the game after half time. \n\"Sans\" cigarettes, this happened again against Angola but his team just couldn't get past Ricardo. \nFranco was denied once more on 55 minutes when he tried to lob the keeper but Ricardo got a hand to it. The ball then dropped to Jesus Arellano but his shot was tame and a defender on the line cleared.\nWhen a defensive clearance rebounded to Omar Bravo Ricardo was in the right place to pick up the striker's scuffed shot.\nRicardo, the Fifa Man of the Match, missed a few crosses but when he got them he didn't drop them. On 64 minutes a cross was whipped in from the right and he caught the cross spectacularly with one-hand.\nAngolan attacks were limited. Mendonca's drive went straight to Oswald Sanchez while a Figueiredo blast from outside the box cleared the bar.\nOn 80 minutes Andre was sent off for deliberate hand ball, his second yellow card offense in the game. All Angolan energies were now diverted to keep the scores level.\nIt was a difficult last ten minutes. Jesus Arellano floated a cross from midfield to Jose Fonseca but his volley went wide. With great technique Marquez connected superbly with a long 35 yard drive but Ricardo leapt to his right and used both hands to push the ball behind for a corner.\nWhile two minutes remained Mexico hit the post for the second time in the match. Ricardo missed a fast cross but Omar Bravo's instinctive redirection toward goal was centimeters out.\nThe qualifiers from Group D was not settled by the result, Friday. Mexico's progress became more tricky. But the Central Americans still had the upper hand. Luis De Oliveira Goncalves's side had to score goals against Iran while Mexico needed only to not lose to Portugal in their last game to certainly go through. \nStatistics.\nGroup D\nAttendance: 43'000\nReferee: Shamsul Maidin (Singapore) \nTable.\n\"Fifa World Cup Group D table June 16, 2006\""}

A B-double truck carrying woodchips slammed into a parked table-top truck as it went around a corner. As a result of the crash, the B-double rolled over.

Police said they were investigating the crash and would prepare a report for the Coroner.\nIn a report released in 2004, the NRMA said that the government should give priority to upgrading the highway among others within the region. In 2005, the NRMA also expressed concern about the highway being reclassified as a regional road (from a state road), putting the onus for maintenance and improvements on councils, which already have limited resources.\nAccording to a 2004 audit conducted by the NRMA, the Mid Western Highway is the fifth safest highway statistically in NSW with 18.7 major crashes per 100 million kilometres travelled and 11.5 fatalities per 100 million kilometres travelled.

They commanded the field with their physical presence.\nWith 10 minutes left some sides up by a single goal would hold the ball near the opponent's corner flag to run down the clock. Ratomir Dujkovic's side, at 25 years and two months the youngest at the Fifa World Cup, did not.\nAgainst ten men they seemed determined to get a killer second goal. They eventually achieved this after numerous chances.\nThey surged forward in numbers such that sometimes the ten men Czech Republic broke with three players attacking four defenders - which might be a dangerous situation when two of them are Pavel Neved and Tomas Rosicky and your side is only one goal in front.\nThe Czech Republic did not take their opportunties to score. Their star midfielders looked busy but with the team's best strikers on the injury list - Milan Baros and Jan Koller - the Czech attack was toothless and a bit disorganised. \nAt one point Rosicky let a low cross through his legs for a runner behind when he was in fact in the best striker's position. \nOn 57 minutes Neved left an imprint of his frustration in the stadium when he kicked an advertising hoarding which left visible stud holes.\nThe game had started brilliant fashion for the passionate Ghanians. They never looked back from the second minute when Asamoah Gyan took a long ball down on his chest and from the edge of the area drove the ball low past Petr Cech.\nOn 31 minutes Gyan got behind the defence but Cech, in a good position, saved. Gyan should have chipped it. In the second period the promising 20-year-old arguably missed many equally good chances with only Petr Cech to beat - again shooting low when he might have gone high.\nKarel Bruckner had Petr Chec to thank for the score not being an embarrassment. After the sending off saves from Ghanians came on 71, 73, 77, and 79 minutes. \nAny hope the central Europeans could surprise with a comeback ended when Sulley Muntari showed how to beat Cech on 84 minutes. In space in the area, he fired high left-footed inside the near post.\nBut before that there was drama of a sending off and missed penalty. Ujfalusi had interrupted Matthew Amoah's kicking leg when he was clean through and was shown a red card by Horacio Elizondo. \nThe referee delayed the red card slightly and this led to what seemed to be a misunderstanding. The crowd roared when the belated red was flashed. Gyan, perhaps in eagerness, might have taken this noise a sign the whistle had blown. \nHe took the penalty, though the referee was not yet in position to let it be taken. This earned the striker a yellow card and put him out of the USA match. An example of the inexperience of the young team. \nHis Serbian coached then watched as Gyan hit midway up the right post with the actual penalty and the score stayed 1-0. \nOn 93 minutes there was a flurry of activity near the Ghana goal and Richard Kingston pulled off two fine saves. But with captain Stephen Appiah and Michael Essian in control of midfield Ghana looked a powerful side who well-deserved their win against the understrength Czechs.\nWith three teams in Group E now on three points all eyes then turned to the next games, as potentially any of the four teams still could qualify.\nStatistics.\nGroup E\nAttendance: 45'000\nReferee: Horacio Elizondo (Argentina) \nTable.\n\"Fifa World Cup Group D table June 17, 2006\"\nRelated news.\nUnited States of America draw 1-1 with Italy in Group E"}

Those who had seen the Czech Republic crush the USA 3-0 might have been surprised at the way the underdogs played against the Azzuri. \nBruce Arena's side began with a 4-5-1 formation and started the game with great energy, attacking from the first whistle. However; arguably against the play Italy scored first. A set piece 45 yards out was driven low and Alberto Gilardino got in front of his defender and glanced a header to the far post.\nUSA got an equaliser on 26 minutes. Christian Zaccardo tried to clear a corner one way but skewed the ball the other. Own goal, Gianluigi Buffon did not move. \nThen there was a crucial turning point in the character of the game. Daniele De Rossi rose for a midfield challenge and hit Brian McBride under the left eye with what looked like an elbow.\nBlood streamed from McBride's face. Uruguay referee Jorge Larrionda gave De Rossi a straight red.\nLarrionda went on to show two more red cards in the match which equalled a tournament record. There had only been three other Fifa World Cup games with three red cards: 1938 Brazil v Czechoslovakia; 1954, Brazil v Hungary; and 1998, Denmark v South Africa.\nFor a few minutes McBride remained shirtless on the touchline while he received boxer treatment and three stiches for his cut. Italian manager Marcello Lippi replaced Francesco Totti with midfield tackler Gennaro Gattuso.\nWith half an hour gone the own goal and De Rossi's mistake had given the USA a massive advantage. But it appears they did not keep their heads.\nTen minutes after Pablo Mastroeni had grazed the crossbar with a shot he made a horrible lunge at the ankles of Andrea Pirlo. Jorge Larrionda flashed the red again.\nJust before half-time the USA had neutralised their advantage. In less than one minute after the restart they were to hand the Italians the advantage. \nEddie Pope was sent off after he received his second caution: two yellow cards equal one red card and now it was ten men versus nine. \nLippi almost immediately got substitute Alexandro Del Piero on for one of his defenders to take advantage of their extra player. Arena brought on another defender and lined up 3-3-2. By 80 minutes this had become 8-0-0.\nFor a game with so few players and so much drama there were very few chances. Only three shots were on target; all for Italy. USA had 8 shots; none on target.\nA statistic that suggests the draw was a tactical victory for the USA coach. Italy's forward line was guilty of getting caught offside 11 times.\nPirlo went close with a freekick and almost forced Carlos Bocanegra to head another dangerous dipping cross into his net; fortunately for Keller it clipped the bar.\nAs the Americans were stretched further Kasey Keller made a couple of crucial saves from Lippi's extra attacker. On 73 minutes he got one hand to a Del Piero header and then palmed away two-handed his long range drive.\nIn the last 10 minutes Italy passed well and created a few chances to score. Vincenzo Iaquinta broke the offside trap, but failed to control the ball with only Keller to beat. \nOn 90 minutes Gilardino headed wide under pressure from Steve Cherundolo.\nUSA, despite playing the entire second half with 9 men might say they were unlucky not to get a second goal. A DaMarcus Beasley shot beat Buffon but was over-ruled because McBride was standing offside in the keeper's line of sight. \nOn USA attacks Landon Donovan kept the ball well which allowed respite from Italian attacks and spurred his team on to play further up the pitch, until their stamina cracked with ten-minutes left.\nThe referee arguably was fair if not consistent. In the second half as both sets of players tired decisions appeared more based on necessity to be more lenient.\nLunges were not whistled and there was an aggressive shirt pull in the USA penalty area that was ignored. In an earlier World Cup match, a Ukraine player had conceded a penalty and was sent off for doing this. \nThe shared point meant either one of Italy or Czech Republic would qualify from Group E for the knock-out stage of the Fifa World Cup. USA next play Ghana: a win for Ghana would mean qualification while the USA would qualify if they won and Italy beat the Czech Republic.\nStatistics.\nGroup E\nAttendance: 46'000\nReferee: Jorge Larrionda (Uruguay) \nTable.\n\"Fifa World Cup Group E table June 17, 2006\"\nRelated news.\nGhana surge past Czech Republic in Group E"}

A lawyer from Sydney will challenge the authority of the state's infringement processing bureau to issue fines for speeding and parking offences.\nThe lawyer claims that when the NSW government moved control of the bureau from the NSW Police to the Office of State Revenue in October 2001, the government failed to make correct legislative changes. He claims that all fines issued since the move are invalid.\nThe basis of the case revolve around whether or not the infringement processing bureau has powers to issue penalty notices (fines) under NSW law.\nThe bureau said that the case would only be relevant to fines which are disputed by a person in court. The bureau said that only five per cent of fines are challenged.\n\"People who did not elect to go to court and have paid their infringement notice will not be affected by any decision, so the issue of refunds does not arise,\" a statement by the Office of State Revenue said.\nFor the 2004/2005 financial year, the infringement processing bureau recorded revenues of AUD$158.7 million from fines.\nNSW Opposition leader Peter Debnam said the government has once again failed to write legislation correctly. \"The bottom line with this thing is that the Government simply hasn't done its homework. We see this time and time again, legislation going through parliament, and it ends up costing tax payers a fortune,\" he said."}

The rulings came while the investigative magistrates were insisting on continuing the restrictions. \nFor the past three years, Mrs. Rajavi and 16 members and supporters of the Iranian Resistance had been under judicial restrictions including the denial of the right to travel, entry to the headquarters of the National Council of Resistance of Iran in Auvers-sur-Oise, and the right to have contact with each other. \nMrs. Rajavi welcomed the verdict and said, \"The case was conceived at the request of the fascist theocracy ruling Iran and was solely based on lies churned out by this regime. With the latest ruling, the time has come for this dossier to be brought to an end and all proceedings halted.\", \"The shameful June 17, 2003 raid was a futile attempt to destroy Iran's democratic opposition and aid the Iranian regime.

Nothing can save the clerical regime from its inevitable fall and nothing can stop the Iranian nation from attaining freedom and democracy,\" she added.\nFollowing the court ruling, dozens of Iranian and French sympathizers of the Resistance went to Mrs. Rajavi's residence in Auvers-sur-Oise, to congratulate her. Mayors of Auvers-sur-Oise and Cergy, in the northern Paris province of Val d'Oise also joined the celebrations.\nNCRI Lawyers statement.\nLawyers involved in the case welcomed the decision by the Paris court of appeals to remove all restrictions imposed on Mrs. Rajavi in a press release issued on Friday.

The main target was the office of the National Council at Auvers-sur-Oise. Police arrested Rajavi, the NCRI's President-elect and 164 Iranian political refugees and activists.\nHours after the raids, three leading human rights organizations in France - The Human Rights League, France Libert\u00e9 foundation and the International Federation of Human Rights - issued a strongly-worded joint statement condemning the action. \nCrackdown on Iranian Resistance in France turns into a scandal"}

But a goal by Adriano four minutes after half time changed that and made for a more attacking game.\nAfter nine minutes Vince Grella set the tone for the first half when he raked his studs on Ronaldo's calf. While the referee did not give a caution for this bad foul, four of the five cautions issued by German referee Markus Merk came in the first half. Two went to Australian players.\nBrazil were closed down quickly and suffered 25 fouls in the game. When they had the ball Australia, who wore a dark blue strip instead of their traditional yellow and green, used their ball possession effectively and got forward with neat passes. \nThe Brazilians in contrast did not start well. On an elusive run into the penalty box Ronaldinho had used fine skill to elude his markers but then trod on the ball and fell over. Ronaldo then had an embarrassing moment when he created a good opening to shoot only to kick at fresh air.\nAnd when Roberto Carlos had broken free unmarked the attacking left-sided defender jumped up and down in frustration when Ronaldo over hit his pass. \nBrazil's goal came four minutes after half time.\nRonaldo rolled the ball across the edge of the box to Adriano. The striker moved quickly to his left and passed a firm shot through Scott Chipperfield's legs. The ball hugged the grass and beat Mark Schwarzer's out-stretched left hand.\nAustralia in an effort to get an equaliser replaced a defender with an attacker. But they found it hard to get past Brazil's defence; Ze Roberto made two key tackles to stop Marco Bresciano and Harry Kewell.\nOn 56 minutes Harry Kewell missed Australia's best chance. The ball came loose to his feet and the goal beckoned. But Dida dived at his feet and Kewell skied his effort over the bar.\nWhile Australia made good forward moves Brazil attacked into the space they left behind. Kaka flicked a Ronaldinho corner on to the crossbar and in injury time missed wide when he only had Schwarzer to beat.\nThe exciting second half was rounded off when on 89 minutes Robinho, who was a lively substitute for Ronaldo, hit a powerful shot off the inside of Schwarzer's left post. Fred tapped in the rebound.\nThe result meant Brazil qualified for the knock-out stage of the Fifa World Cup while Australia would need to get a least a draw against Croatia in their final Group F game to extend their stay in Germany.\nStatistics.\nGroup F\nAttendance: 66'000\nReferee: Markus Merk (Germany)\nTable.\n\"Fifa World Cup Group F table June 18, 2006\""}

Their three forwards hardly got a touch; in fact they didn't have a single shot in the first half and had only two on target in 90 minutes. \nBy contrast the French had three times as many shots as the Koreans but managed only four accurate attempts on Lee Woon-Jae's goal - two more than the Koreans managed. A poor showing for a side so at ease it played mostly in its opposition's half of the pitch and did not concede a shot until the 54th minute.\nAll looked good when Henry had scored after nine minutes. The ball got through the defence via a deflection; and with a touch from his right foot the Arsenal striker put the ball into the perfect position to pass it in with his left.\nWith the great throng of red Koreans bouncing up and down and singing there was a great atmosphere in the Zentralstadion and it did not sound like their side were a goal down. \nA Patrick Viera header followed from a corner and was saved by Lee Woon-Jae. There was no great French appeal but the television replay clearly showed the ball had crossed the line. \nAfter half time the French kept to their slow passing game which made Dick Advocaat's hustling team exceptionally tired without killing them off. With ten minutes left the Korean game sprang to life and deckchairs were brought out to witness a mugging.\nEric Abidal brought down Lee Young-Pyo and got a yellow card. Quick Korean passes found their target and the French suddenly looked a little disorganised.\nA cross from deep near the right corner flag from Seol Ki-Hyeon found Cho Jin-Jae. Beyond the far post, the substitute headed back into the path of Park Ji-sung who from five yards helped the ball over both Fabian Barthez and William Gallas. \nThe slowness by which the ball went over a grasping Barthez and the French centre half was tantalising and made the score seem more painful.\nNow there was a ripping end-to-end contest. Three minutes later Thierry Henry got a chance to make it 2-1 but Lee Woon-Jae jammed his arm hard on the ground for a magnificent left-handed save. In the final minute Ahn Jung-Hwan screamed a free kick past Barthez's right post.\nThe result meant France, who still had not won a game since the 1998 World Cup final, probably had to win their last match against Togo for a chance to reach the knock-out stage of the 2006 World Cup.

Jim Furyk, Colin Montgomerie, and Phil Mickelson all tied for second place one stroke behind at 6 over. Ogilvy, born in Adelaide, Australia took home almost $1.25 million dollars. Other notable scores include Vijay Singh at a tie for 6th at 8 over, David Duval making a comeback at a tie for 16th place at 11 over, Adam Scott at a tie for 21st at 12 over and Ernie Els tying for 26th at 13 over.\nDefending champion Michael Campbell of New Zealand, Retief Goosen, and Tiger Woods all missed the cut in the hardest U.S. Open in a long time - the worst Open on record was also at Winged Foot in 1974, where winner Hale Irwin shot 7 over. This was Tiger's first tournament since his father's death on May 9, although he said in a press conference that there was no excuse for his awful playing. Woods said of his poor playing, \"I don't care if you had what transpired in my life of recent or not, but poor execution is never going to feel very good.\"\nOgilvy came in to the clubhouse, almost sure of his second place. But Phil Mickelson's double bogey at the 18th hole gave Ogilvy a boost in the leaderboard, bringing him to first. He said later, \"I thought, Make this and come in second in the Open on your own. I never thought Phil would make bogey at the last. He ended up making double, and it's got to be a hard one to swallow for Phil, because he's obviously been the outstanding player at majors in the last eight or nine months.\" Mickelson only hit 2 out of 14 fairways on Sunday and 24 out of 56 total. He managed to scramble out in the first three rounds, but the course fought back on Sunday. His tee shot at the final hole went far left. He played the shot very aggressively and ended up hitting a tree and putting the ball only 25 yards farther. It just got worse from there for Mickelson. His third shot ended up buried in the left greenside bunker. His fourth went back over the green and into the rough. He chipped out and one-putted for the catastrophic double bogey that cost him the championship. \nOgilvy didn't win purely by Mickelson's double bogey, though. He saved par on the 17th with a chip-in from the rough, and overcame a few tough shots to save par at the 18th. His last two US Opens resulted in a missed cut in 2003 at a tie for 28th last year. His win this year at the WGC Accenture Match Play Championship set him up for the first Australian major win since Steve Elkington at the 1995 PGA Championship. \nBesides Mickelson, there are quite a few other contenders who are not going to forget today - or the vicious 18th hole - for a while. Colin Montgomerie made a remarkable comeback after a poor round yesterday, holing a 75-footer for birdie at the 17th hole. His second shot, from 172 yards away in the fairway, went far right into a very deep cut of rough. His third shot went 40 feet past the hole. He put his par putt 10 feet from the hole, missed that putt, and went on to also make double bogey. Jim Furyk hit a bunker shot to 5 feet on the 18th, but two-putted and came up one stroke short of Oglivy. Padraig Harrington, who ended up in sole fifth at 7 over, went bogey-free for 15 holes and bogeyed the last three to fall out of contention. And of course, there's Kenneth Ferrie, who started the day out tied with Mickelson for the lead. He just crashed the whole day, making 6 bogeys and no birdies to fall to a tie for 6th at 8 over.\nA summary? The Mickelslam is no more, and another newcomer has made his statement at the 2006 US Open. No one can deny that Winged Foot has provided yet again a challenge that has beaten even the best of players."}

The vote is considered a victory for Japan, which has long argued for a return to commercial whaling, and has been 'recruiting' sympathetic nations to join the IWC in order to bolster its vote.\nThe vote does not directly enable a return to commercial whaling, as that would require a three quarters majority, but is significant in being the first time that a major vote at the IWC has sided with the pro-whaling nations in two decades.\nPrevious votes during the conference had been narrowly won by the anti-whaling group of countries, including a motion to introduce secret ballots, to introduce an exemption allowing Japanese coastal communities to whale, the elimination of a Southern Ocean whale sanctuary and a block on the IWC discussing dolphins and porpoises.\nCommercial whaling has been banned under the IWC moratorium since 1986, but some whaling has been able to continue. Japan and Iceland have hunted a number of Minke whales every year under an exemption for 'scientific whaling'. Norway flat out refused to accept the original ban. The stated aims of scientific whaling are to examine the stomach contents of captured whales, in order to examine the whale ecosystem and the effect that whales may have on fish stocks. However, the whale meat from scientific whaling catches is usually sold commercially in order to fund the research. Some observers, including scientists from New Zealand, have accused Japan and Iceland of simply using scientific whaling as a legal loophole. Other whaling allowed under the IWC moratorium includes subsistence whaling by aboriginal groups.\nGreenpeace activist Adele blogged the news from their Stockholm office expressing reservations over the legitimacy of the vote saying it would \"change little or nothing\" as previous votes had already been passed in favour of the anti-whaling group of countries. Mike Townsley from Greenpeace International said, \"Greenpeace is disgusted that any member of the IWC would seek to promote whaling based upon the false notion that whales consume so much fish that they are a threat to food security for coastal nations\". He added that the declaration was more like a whaler's \"wish list, peddling predictable and well-rehearsed rhetoric\". \nA paragraph within the declaration passed at the IWC meeting suggested that a number of international NGOs with self-interest campaigns were using threats in an attempt to direct government policy \"on matters of sovereign rights related to the use of resources for food security and national development\". In response, Greenpeace says they were dedicated to the principles of \"peaceful protests\", adding that the threat was to the world's whales. They stated that they had \"delayed, disrupted and documented hunts in the Southern Ocean\" in order to defend the whales, however.\nDr. Joth Singh from the International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW) said, \"after losing on every single proposal they brought to this meeting, the whaling countries and their supporters cooked up a non-binding statement, sprang it on the commission and pushed it to a vote - they want to kill whales, and they're willing to kill the Commission to do it.\" He added that they were concerned, but not disheartened by the news.\nJapanese commissioner, Mr Minoru Morimoto, praised the winning vote and said the declaration \"added weight to Japan's proposal to normalize the IWC and bring it back to its original function of managing and regulating sustainable commercial whaling.\"\nThe IWC has historically always voted against pro-whaling motions by a majority of around ten votes, but the number of members favoring a return to commercial whaling has increased in recent years, with Japan persuading several new countries to join the IWC, including many that have never done any whaling at all. As Japan has given aid to some of these new countries, some observers have accused it of buying votes."}

The shooting occurred when Calipari was escorting the Italian journalist Giuliana Sgrena on her way to Baghdad airport. When their car came under fire from U.S. Marines at a roadblock, Calipari was fatally shot while trying to shield Sgrena, who was only lightly wounded in the incident.\nThe circumstances of the shooting are a matter of dispute between Italy and the United States. The U.S. military claims that the car was approaching the checkpoint at high speed, when the troops attempted to signal the car with light signals, aiming a green laser at the windshield and warning shots. When the car failed to slow down, the soldiers shot into the engine of the car.\nThe Italian government claims that there were no warning signs prior to the shootings. They contest that the car was speeding and that it accelerated after the first round of fire. Moreover, they allege that a proper inquiry into the case was impossible since the vehicle was removed and army logs destroyed shortly after the incident.\nItalian prosecutors are arguing that the shooting was a \"political murder\" as Calipari was a civil servant and the shooting damaged Italy's interests. In Italy, murder suspects cannot be tried in absentia unless the murder has political connotations. It is expected to take at least two months for a judge to rule on the indictment request.\nThe U.S. Embassy in Rome declined to comment."}

Andriy Rusol ran to the near post and met Maxim Kalinichenko's hard spun cross with his knee. \nUkraine, whose slick passes and fast runs frequently pulled the Saudi Arabia defense out of position, could have been four goals up by half time.\nIn one instance, from another Kalinichenko corner Andriy Shevchenko had a powerful header cleared off the line by Ahmed Dokhi. \nSehiy Rebrov, in acres of space, scored the second from 30 yards; his strong shot dipped across Mabrouk Zaid, who slipped in a vain attempt to reach it.\nThe second period began as the first had; Ukraine scored early. Kalinchenko provided another beautiful cross which Shevchenko guided toward the far post with his forehead.\nShevchenko surged down left wing and set up the fourth goal on 83 minutes. Into the penalty area, Shevchenko committed the keeper and then gave the perfect ball to Kalinchenko who passed it into the roof of the net.\nThough ball possession was equal the telling statistic was the shot total. Ukraine had 19 shots; nine on target. Saudi Arabia had six shots; none on target.\nThere also were 49 free kicks in the match which might be partly due to the rain over the AOL Arena which made the pitch slipperly. Ukraine committed 25 of the fouls and got three of six yellow cards.\nIt was not a rigourous test for the East European side but they now had three points which meant a draw in their next game against Tunisia would definitely send them into the round of sixteen if Tunisia did not win against Spain, who also played Monday. The result against Ukraine would almost certainly put Paqueta's Saudi Arabia out of the World Cup.\nStatistics.\nGroup H\nAttendance: 50'000\nReferee: Graham Poll (England) \nTable.\n\"Fifa World Cup Group H table June 19, 2006\"\nRelated news.\nSpain passes Tunisia test to win 3-1 in Group H"}

His strong run ended with the ball prodded to Jaouhar Mnari. The Tunisian number 12's shot was saved by Iker Casillas but he passed the rebound into the turf and over the keeper.\nSpain were behind. And then it started to rain hard.\nFor 70 minutes Spain attacked and failed to beat the Tunisian keeper Ali Boumnijel. While he made seven saves the wet conditions made holding the football hard and Boumnijel faced a lot of shots. \nIn the first period crosses and corner kicks met heads in the Tunisian box but none of the succession of different foreheads found the target. On 43 minutes Xabi Alonso went closest: his header from a corner was cleared off the line by Anis Ayari. \nAs the clock ticked it seemed Spain's short passing game was the longest route to goal.\nIn the end Luis Aragones's three substitutions can be said to have unlocked the Tunisian defence. On 71 minutes the floodgates opened like the storm clouds had in the Gottlieb Daimler Stadion.\nJoaquin ran down the right and passed to Cesc Fabregas at the top of the area. Fabregas's first time shot was not particularly powerful but Boumnijel gave up a rebound and in followed Raul. 1-1.\nFor his second assist Fabregas then played in Fernando Torres who rounded the keeper for the game winner.\nOn 90 minutes Raul chipped to the far post for Torres who then appeared to be tugged to the floor. The young Athletico Madrid striker scored low under the keeper from the spot.\nTorres, who with three goals in two matches became the top scorer at the Fifa World Cup, could have had two more goals in the final minutes from surges through the Tunisian defence. In the first instance the keeper saved well and in the second Torres blasted over.\nThe goals though they came late created a scoreline that reflected Spainish dominance of the game. They outshot their opponents by 20 and had 11 more corner kicks. Tunisian players accrued six yellow cards in their attempt to hold back Aragones's side who also hogged 66 per cent of possession.\nThe result meant Spain were through to the round of sixteen of the Fifa World Cup and that Tunisia had to beat Ukraine in their third and final match of Group H if they wanted to join them there.\nStatistics.\nGroup H\nAttendance: 52'000\nReferee: Carlos Eug\u00eanio Simon (Brazil) \nTable.\n\"Fifa World Cup Group H table June 19, 2006\"\nRelated news.\nUkraine beats Saudi Arabia 4-0 in Group H"}
