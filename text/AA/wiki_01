They occupy two racks, with each rack receiving electricity from two independent supplies. However, both supplies have circuit-breakers in them, and both opened at the same time, leading to a total power failure. All computers immediately went down. It's normal for fire safety regulations to prohibit uninterruptible power supplies in colos, with the colo providing its own UPS and generator instead. The circuit breakers were on the computer side of this emergency power system, so none of the computers continued to receive power to survive the breaker trip or shut down safely.\nThe actual reason why the circuit breakers tripped is currently unknown.\nWhen power was restored, it was discovered that most of the MySQL databases that store the data which makes up Wikipedia et al had been corrupted. The main database and the four slaves had all damaged the data on their hard disk drives beyond the ability of the auto-correction to repair. Only one copy survived safely, on a machine that is used for report generation and maintenance tasks, which remained 31 hours backlogged while catching up after an unusually heavy update load during the previous week. \nVolunteer Wikimedia engineers worked through the night rebuilding the databases from the sole good copy onto the other servers. The Wikipedia database is over 180Gb in size, making the copying process last 1.5 - 2 hours for every server it was performed upon.\nRegular back-ups of the database of Wikipedia projects are maintained - the encyclopedia in its entirety was \"not\" at risk. The last database download was made on February 9; all edits since then could only have been laboriously rebuilt from logs and recovered from the damaged database requiring much more time and effort.\nLimited read-only service was established late Tuesday afternoon, with editing becoming possible 24 hours after the power failure. Final repairs continue now, as well as upgrades to prevent similar issues in the future. Server-intensive features, such as categories and 'watchlists' that display recent changes to selected articles to registered users, remain disabled to ease the load on the recovering systems.\nThe process which led to the damage originated with the operating system, disk controllers, or hard drives failing to flush the data correctly. \nIf the power to a database server is cut mid-write, the database may be corrupted and unreadable, however the operating system, hardware, and software are designed to make this very unlikely. In a previous incident in 2004 power was also lost to a server but the database was undamaged.\nTo avoid such damage, each database server saves a copy of an edit to be applied to the database on a separate storage system before making the actual update to the database itself. This so-called 'write-ahead logging' should ensure that in the event of a system crash, the database can be rebuilt from a 'last-good' state by replaying the edits saved in the log. \nEarlier this year popular blogging site LiveJournal suffered a similar power failure when another customer at their colocation facility pressed an Emergency Power Off button, intended for use only by firefighters. The company suffered database corruption similar to that seen at Wikimedia. \nLiveJournal are now fitting UPS to their servers to ensure that they have time to shut down safely in the event of a power failure. Wikimedia was said to be investigating the possibility of fitting similar equipment at the time of this failure.\nSeveral pundits have suggested that the use of another database, such as the proprietary database Oracle or the free PostgreSQL, would have avoided the database corruption seen at the server cluster. A post-mortem of the incident show the failure was in the operating system, or the hardware, or some combination of the two. LiveJournal, which also uses MySQL, reported similar database corruption after their power cut.\nThe Wikimedia foundation only allows the use of free software on its systems, and future versions of the Mediawiki software will support the PostgreSQL database.\nUsers are reminded that during times of system failure or excessive demand, they can still search Wikipedia using Google.

The US National Cancer Institute has also accepted the work into its rapid access program, which aims to speed experimental drugs into human clinical trials. \n\"This research is a very important step in setting the stage for future development of a new therapy for leukemia,\" says Rochester researcher Craig Jordan. \"We have proof that we can kill leukemia stem cells with this type of agent, and that is good news.\"\nParthenolide appears to target the roots of myeloid leukemia, stem cells, while current treatments including the relatively new drug Gleevec don't.

Because neutralizing antibodies attack viruses before they enter cells, they could form the basis for effective AIDS vaccines if present before exposure to HIV. But while the body makes many antibodies against HIV, they are usually unable to neutralize the virus. Some people, however, do produce effective neutralizing antibodies for HIV. \nDennis Burton of Scripps and colleagues have now described the structure of one of these, called 4E10. In tests, the antibody neutralized nearly 100 strains of HIV from around the world. \nIsolated about a decade ago from an HIV-infected person by study coauthor Hermann Katinger of the Institute for Applied Microbiology of the University of Agriculture in Vienna, Austria, the antibody shows what type of structure can neutralize HIV. \nIt appears that 4E10 targets an area on the HIV surface protein GP41 that the virus uses to fuse its membrane to a human cell's membrane during infection. \nBecause the antibody's structure shows what this area on HIV's surface looks like, it provides scientists with a template for reverse-engineering components for AIDS vaccines. \nThe research is reported in the journal Immunity.

While seasonal flu kills 12,000 Britons annually, a pandemic would affect far more people and could result in the deaths of up to 50,000 people in the UK if there were no medical intervention.\nThe government will have the power to cancel events where large numbers of people gather, such as football (soccer) matches. It could also advise travel restrictions to and from areas of high infection, but would not be able to enforce any such measures.\nSchools might be closed in the event of a flu pandemic, and infected people would be asked to remain at home, although again no measures could be imposed by the government.\nFurther plans include education of the public to recognize symptoms of the flu and how to avoid infection.\nMeasures will be made to maintain basic services in the event of a pandemic despite staff absences through illness.\nA major cornerstone of the plan is the prescription of oseltamivir, an oral neuraminidase inhibitor drug that combats influenza. The drug is currently marketed by Hoffman La Roche under the trade name Tamiflu\u00ae. \nThe UK Department of Health intends to stockpile 14.6m courses of the drug over the next two financial years, giving enough to treat one in four of the population - the ratio recommended by the WHO. \nCanada and Australia have also bought the equivalent amounts of anti-viral drugs. The U.S. has also bought large amounts of similar drugs.\nThe total cost of the acquisition was not published by the government, but the BBC estimated the cost to be \u00a3180 million.\nUnlike a vaccine, oseltamivir can be used to treat any strain of the influenza virus. Many new variants of the influenza virus are seen every year, and combined with the long lead times associated with the development of vaccinces, mass vaccination is frequently impractical.\nSome parts of the newly-revealed plan already exist. The UK government recently gave \u00a3500,000 to the WHO for survellience of so-called 'bird flu' in South East Asia, a possible source for any future pandemic. The Department of Health will also continue to monitor flu-like cases seen by doctors and hospitals.\nBackground on Influenza, from Wikipedia.\nInfluenza is an extremely variable disease; similar viruses are found in pigs and domestic fowl. In areas where there are high concentrations of humans, pigs and birds in close proximity, such as parts of Asia, simultaneous infections across species enable genetic material to be exchanged between the various strains of flu. This appears to be the principal method by which new infectious strains arise. \nIt is believed that sooner or later, a recombination may occur to produce a strain as lethal as the 1918 virus. In late 1997, a new strain of avian influenza (also known as bird flu) originating from chickens infected 18 people in Hong Kong, of whom 6 died. This strain did not appear to be readily transmissible from human to human, but such a high mortality rate, and the possibility of a further recombination to make it more infectious, meant that the risk was considered so great that all domestic poultry in Hong Kong was slaughtered. Avian influenza transmissible to humans resurfaced in January 2004 in Cambodia, Vietnam, and Thailand.\nThere were several serious outbreaks of influenza in the 20th century. The most famous (and the most lethal) was the Spanish Flu pandemic (type A influenza, H1N1 strain), which lasted from 1918 to 1919 and is believed to have killed more people in total than World War I. Lesser flu pandemics included the 1957 Asian Flu (type A, H2N2 strain) and the 1968 Hong Kong Flu (type A, H3N2 strain).\nAlthough there were scares in New Jersey in 1976 (the Swine Flu), worldwide in 1977 (the Russian Flu), and in Hong Kong in 1997 (Avian influenza), there have been no major pandemics subsequent to the 1968 infection. Increased immunity from antibodies and the development of flu vaccines have limited the spread of the virus and so far prevented any further pandemics."}

A Federal Court judge ruled that his anti-Semitic activities were \"not only a threat to Canada's national security, but also a threat to the international community of nations.\"\nIn a press release given by B'nai Brith Canada, executive vice president Frank Dimant said that \"For decades Zundel has spewed his venom and imbued his brand of hate in a new generation of white supremacist groups that had made him a hero ... Zundel's day of reckoning has finally come.\" Canadian Jewish Congress National President Ed Morgan was quoted as saying that \u201cthis is a significant day for the Jewish community (of Canada) and for all those who treasure tolerance in a multicultural society ... Zundel\u2019s departure demonstrates Canada\u2019s abhorrence for those who would propagate Holocaust denial and antisemitism. It brings closure to our efforts to bring this man to justice.\" \nZ\u00fcndel's Toronto lawyer, Peter Lindsay, said Z\u00fcndel is \"very disillusioned about the process and about being the victim of a secret trial, and now being deported based on evidence he's never seen.\"\nUpon arriving in Germany, Z\u00fcndel, 65, was immediately taken into custody by authorities on the grounds that he was running a web site denying the existence of the Holocaust, which is a crime in that country. Prosecutors in the city of Mannheim have issued a warrant for his arrest according to the Associated Press. A spokeswoman for the federal Justice Ministry, on condition of anonymity, said authorities were able to open a case against Zundel because his Holocaust-denying site can be accessed in Germany.\nIn 1977, Z\u00fcndel founded a small press publishing house called Samisdat Publishers which issued such pamphlets as \"The Hitler We Loved\" and \"Why and Did Six Million Really Die?\" by Richard Harwood aka Richard Verrall (a British neo-Nazi leader) as well as booklets claiming that UFOs were actually Nazi secret weapons operated from secret Nazi military bases in Antarctica. Zundel lived in Canada for 42 years as a landed immigrant. His last two years were spent in a Toronto jail, where he was held under the Canadian security certificate law. The law was passed after the September 11, 2001 attacks in the United States, and allows the Canadian government to hold suspects of terrorism without charge, based on secret evidence that does not have to be disclosed to a suspect or his defense."}

The office suite was translated from the English version of OpenOffice.org, an open source suite based on Sun Microsystems' StarOffice. Jambo OpenOffice.org was translated by a multinational team including Swedish and Spanish programmers, as well as linguists from the University of Dar es Salaam. Monday's release included builds for Linux and Windows.\nThe office suite has four components: a word processor, a spreadsheet, a presentation creator, and a drawing program. The translation effort required translating 18,000 English strings, made up of one or more words, many of which have previously had no direct Swahili equivalent. As part of the translation, the team developed a glossary of 1500 technical words in Swahili. The office suite also includes a spellchecker with a lexicon of 70,000 words.\nSwahili is not the only African language into which OpenOffice is being translated. According to Ethan Zuckerman, a fellow at Harvard University's Berkman Center for Internet and Society, OpenOffice is being translated into nine official languages of South Africa by Translate.org.za. The same organization is also supporting translation efforts to bring the software into the Rwandan language Kinyarwanda, and Hausa, a language spoken largely in Nigeria.\nSwahili is spoken by approximately 55 million people worldwide, predominantly in East African countries, including Tanzania and Kenya.\nInterview with the project coordinator\n\"Replies to questions from by Alberto Escudero-Pascual, March 3, 2005\"\n &gt; 1. Is the suite 100% translated to Swahili now?\nThe suite contains more than 99% of the strings in Swahili. The ones\nthat are left in English (less than 100 strings out of 18,000) will\nbe worked out in the next release. Yes, this release is fully functional\nin Swahili.\n &gt; 2. What would people who speak only Swahili \n &gt; do before Monday's release if they needed a \n &gt; word processor? Are there any alternatives?\nNo alternatives. This is the first ever release of a word processor in Swahili.\n &gt; 3. How widely do you expect the suite to be distributed? \n &gt; What sort of IT infrastructure exists in East Africa?\nI \"expect\" the software to get installed in all the primary schools of\nthe country. I also expect the software to be installed in the main\nuniversities of the country and colleges. We have postive feedback\nfrom them but this is a rather \"political\" decision out of my (our)\ncontrol.\nThe secondary schools have compulsory English so they might not want\nto install it.\nEast Africa, ufff that is like asking what IT infrastructure is in the\nwhole Europe :-D\nIf you mean connectivity, all is satellite VSAT upstreams. Most of\nthe local loops in Dar are based on IEEE 802.11b. It is expensive for\nmost of the locals. But there is an Internet Exchange already in Dar es Salaam\nwhere the ISP peer together. Things will always get\nbetter. The software is placed in the IX.\nThe software will spread slowly, but I am sure that will spread.\n &gt; 4. What next? How many words are there to translate \n &gt; in a small Linux distribution like Knoppix?\nThe Tanzanian team will start translating OOo training documentation,\nand next they will work with Firefox. A Linux desktop might come next\nyear.\nI have no idea what will it take to translate Knoppix, but the\npriorities should be in getting first a couple of good tools as\nOpenOffice and Firefox and do loads and loads of training material in\nSwahili.\n &gt; 5. How will future versions be compiled once you \n &gt; return to Sweden?\nI have developed an almost automatic version to update JambOOo 1.1.3 in\nKiswahili. The UDSM has access to one of the build servers. I expect a\nnew release of JambOO, maybe 1.1.4 with all the bug corrections in six\nmonths. The next step is to migrate to OOo 2.0, I have no clear\npicture of how that will happen.\n &gt; Will it all come through one copy of Visual Studio\n &gt; in Dar es Salaam?\nNope, the Win32 version was developed entirely in Sweden and Spain during\nChristmas 2004 . The new build system does not require Visual Studio\nto \"update\" the Swahili strings.\n &gt; 6. How was the project funded? How can people contribute to this\n &gt; project, or similar projects in the future?\nSIDA (Swedish International Cooperation Agency) has funded the\nUniversity of Dar es Salaam and the Institute of Kiswahili Research\nfor one full year. My company IT+46 also was funded by SIDA to support\nthe project technically.\nIT+46 has contributed 50% of its working-time at no cost to the project.\n &gt; 7. What is the plan for IT +46?\nOur plan was to be in Tanzania only six months and handle all the\ntechnology and the training back to the university as we want them to\nkeep on with the development by themselves. Now, we are trying to find\nsimilar projects that need support. There are many languages out there\nafter all.\nSources.\nCoverage of Linux release in December:\nAbout the Visual Studio donation for the Windows build a few weeks ago:\nBlog entry about workshop in Arusha:\nInterview with Escudero from October 2004:\nGeneral background:\nOlder media coverage:\nRelated stories about Microsoft in Africa:"}

The bill will replace current powers that allow the detention of foreign terror suspects without trial which has been ruled against as a breach of human rights by the law lords.\nThe Conservatives wanted a \"sunset clause\" inserted into the bill which would have allowed ministers to revisit it in November.

Pain researchers have been left furious after work aimed at controlling pain has been used to develop technology aimed at maximising it.\nIntended for use against protesters and rioters, the research focuses on the effect electromagnetic pulses can have on pain reception. Due to be ready by 2007, the Pulsed Energy Projectile (PEP) weapon will fire a burst of electrically charged gas, or \"plasma\", which will generate an electromagnetic pulse on impact. It is this pulse which will trigger impulses in nerve cells causing extreme pain. \nA review of the non-lethal weapon by the US Naval Studies Board in 2003 concluded that PEPs produced \u201cpain and temporary paralysis\u201d in animal test subjects. Studies ongoing at the University of Central Florida in Orlando aim at optimising this effect. The ultimate aim is to generate a pulse which will trigger optimum pain in the subject without damaging tissues. Studies due to be carried out on lab grown cells aim at identifying the threshold of pain that can be inflicted on someone without causing death. There is some concern that the studies will fall short of demonstrating a safe level for a plasma burst. \nThe work came to light after documents were released under the US's Freedom of Information Act to the Sunshine Project, an organisation who aims to expose biological weapons research. One document entitled \u201cSensory consequences of electromagnetic pulses emitted by laser induced plasmas\u201d concerned the generation and firing of PEPs.

Australian officials were aware that he had been transferred by the United States to Egypt for six months. During this time, Habib claims he was subjected to various methods of torture, including electric shock and being held under water.\nThe United States denies that Habib was tortured with their knowledge, although US officials were not present during his overseas captivity and could not guarantee that he had not been tortured. Egypt has not confirmed that Habib was ever in the country.\nA similar case involving Syrian born Canadian Maher Arar, deported to Syria in October, 2002, subsequently held and allegedly tortured for 374 days, led to Canada issuing a travel advisory strongly cautioning Canadians born in Iraq, Iran, Syria, Libya and Sudan against travel to the United States for any reason. A subsequent internal RCMP investigation found several instances of impropriety in the Arar case, including the provision of sensitive information on Arar to US officials, and that a liaison officer may have known of the deportation plan but did not contact his supervisors.\nMr. Arar's attempt to sue American Attorney-General John Ashcroft over the incident in January 2004 was dismissed when the US government invoked the rarely used \"state secrets privilege\", claiming that to go forward in open court would jeopardize intelligence, foreign policy, and national security interests.\nLegal analysts point out that information obtained through the use of torture is useless in court proceedings, but US officials insist that the information obtained from such interrogations is still useful for their purposes, and that \"it has resulted in the capture of terrorists.\""}

A truck from Newmont Mining Company dumped two metal canisters of mercury along an Andean highway, in the communities of San Juan, Choropampa, and Magdalena. Curious townspeople (mostly children) picked up the silvery droplets, and some even drank some of it. Many residents became sick from severe mercury poisoning. Some of those who came in contact with the mercury suffered blindness, and one even had a purplish rash on her body.\nOver 300 people directly suffered the effects of mercury poisoning.\nAs the owners of the Yanacocha mine which produced the mercury, Newmont Mining offered up to US$6 thousand to more than 700 local residents, but over 1,100 others are still engaged in a legal battle with Newmont over the case.\nIn today's global economy, many international businesses have looked overseas to maintain their profits, but environmental law professor James Otto is asking about the cost to the environment and public health. \"Any company that wants to mine internationally now must not only have the legal right to mine but also a 'social license' to operate,\" he said. \"Peru has been a wake-up call.\"\nAs the Peruvian residents gear up for their lawsuit against Denver-based Newmont Mining, the world's largest gold mining firm, some of these important questions may finally be answered. After the breakdown of mediation talks with Newmont on January 20, the residents and their lawyer decided to stop negotiating behind closed doors and take their case to the public. Last Saturday, March 5, 2005, they announced that they are bringing their suit before Denver District Judge Robert Hyatt. \"If successful,\" states Ken Krowder who represents the plaintiffs, \"[this] would mark the first time an American firm is held accountable for environmental damages overseas.\"\nThis is not the first time Newmont Mining has had trouble with an emerging Third World environmental movement. Recently, in August 2004, a US$543 million lawsuit was filed against Newmont Mining by the Indonesian Environmental Ministry and local villagers. They claim that pollution caused by the company\u2019s mining activities has caused serious illnesses and other health problems, including skin disease, tumors, birth defects, and a decline in fish stocks, a staple food. One particular mining practice used frequently by Newmont Mining in Indonesia is submarine tailings disposal, a waste disposal method for mercury and arsenic that is outlawed in the United States.\nAt least six Newmont Mining managers, including an American and an Australian, face up to 15 years in a Jakarta prison for environmental and corporate crime in that case.\nThe local Peruvian residents are continuing their fight for safer mining practices and compensation for existing damage and injuries. Thousands of local townspeople protested against the Yanacocha mine last fall, demanding protection for the local water supply.\nNewmont Mining officials have blamed the June 2000 mercury spill on a contractor, and have lost the battle to keep the case out of the American court system."}

John Pendry, a physicist at Imperial College in London, UK: \"The concept is an interesting one, with several important potential applications. It could find uses in stealth technology and camouflage.\"\nEarlier attempts at constructing an invisibility screen resulted in the chameleon-principle: screens were coloured to match their background, rendering them hard, but not impossible to see, but usually from only a limited point of view.\nThe principle on which the technology is founded can be explained as follows: an object can be seen because light scatters from its surface back to our eyes. If the scattering of light could be prevented, the object could not be seen. By making a screen resonate in tune with the light, scattering of light would be prevented. This can be achieved by using plasmons, waves of electronic density caused by electrons in a metalic surface moving in sync. If the frequency of the light is close to that of the shield, the light scattered by the object will be negligible compared to the light scattered by the shield. For visible light, silver and gold can be used as metals, for other frequencies, such as infrared and ultra-violet, other metals will have to be used.\nSources.\n "}

Taiwan views the development as violating international norms for peacefully resolving disputes. \"This law exposes China's plot to impose armed force to swallow up Taiwan,\" read the council's written statement. \"In essence, it has handed its military a blank check to unleash force against Taiwan.\" A Taiwanese Defence Ministry spokesperson announced that military exercises will be held this summer to practice defending against an attack.\nThe White House had urged China to reconsider the law before it was passed.

A report issued on Feb. 23 by a cadre of environment and economics researchers suggested that Kenya should ban the common plastic bag that one gets at the checkout counter of grocery stores, and place a levy on other plastic bags, all to combat the country's environmental problems stemming from the bags' popularity.\nThe trouble with bags.\nThe new report was a result of work by Kenyan government, the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), and the Kenya Institute for Public Policy Research and Analysis. It evaluated the state of waste management in the country with particular attention to plastic bag pollution, and recommended that bags less than 30 microns in thickness be banned, a levy be placed on suppliers of thicker bags, and a number of programs be developed to encourage people in the country to not litter, but to recycle and use alternative or reusable bags for their shopping needs instead.\nOn one hand, the bags are often better than the alternatives, and are getting better. The Society of the Plastics Industry (SPI) in the United States quotes the University of Arizona 's report that plastics are getting more compact and take up less space in landfills. Plastic bags compare favorably with paper bags which require more energy to produce, generate more waste and burn less cleanly, according to the SPI.\nBut on the other hand, the bags have gotten so thin as to be barely reusable and recyclable: grocers will frequently double-bag heavy produce, and the bag weighs so little that a great number of bags have to be collected to create an effectively recycled mass of plastic. The light-weight bags are easily picked up by wind, and end up escaping open trash bins and refuse heaps. By littering the landscape, plastic bags become a choking hazard for cattle; in the sea they hurt marine mammals. In , plastic bags were banned after they were blamed for blocking storm drains and causing flooding. Even if they do enter the landfill successfully, the bags take up to 1000 years to bio-degrade.\nPlastic bags in Kenya are an especially acute problem. According to the report, waste management in the country isn't very effective, due partially to a lack of municipal trash pickup in squatter settlements and satellite towns outside the cities' boundaries. Less than 25% of the solid waste generated daily gets processed by a combination of public and private efforts. \nSometimes plastic bag litter can have even further consequences. According to 2004 Nobel Peace Prize winner, Kenyan Professor Wangari Mathaai, discarded bags fill up with rainwater and become perfect breeding grounds for malaria-bearing mosquitoes. is Africa's most deadly infectious disease in children, and over 50% of all hospital visits in some areas are malaria-related. Social costs of plastic litter add up as well: countries lacking comprehensive waste management often sprout underground economies of ragpickers \u2014 typically children who wander refuse heaps and collect potentially recyclable materials for sale to shady businessmen operating from official dump sites. The ragpickers in developing countries struggle with plastic bags, preferring thicker materials that require fewer items to be picked up for the same weight.\nThe problem with bags is that they are victims of their own success: they are so very cheap to manufacture that, at a cost of 0.01 per bag, retailers often absorb the price of bags into the price of merchandise they sell. This makes the bag appear free to the consumers, who in turn do not value it, and toss the bag away with little reuse. In a vicious circle, the low cost of the bags drives down the amount of material used to manufacture them, creating bags that are flimsy and not easy to reuse.\nThe report places an emphasis on learning from the successes and failures of other countries' approaches to regulating the plastics industry. Several European countries introduced legislation that deals with plastic bags. In Ireland, a surcharge on plastic bags decreased their use by 90%. A similar move in Denmark saw the bag use drop by 66%. Australia and New Zealand have also considered or implemented some plastics regulation legislation. South Africa's plastic bag problem reached a climax in 2003 \u2014 plastic bags littered the street to such an extent that they earned the nickname \"national flower\". The country introduced regulations similar to those proposed in Kenya, and within less than a year a reduction in plastic litter was already apparent, according to the report.\nThe report also recognizes that policies require tradeoffs, and incorporates this into their recommendations. For example, the suggested policy of banning thin bags in favor of thicker ones seems counterintuitive: after all, the thicker ones contain more material that is the cause of the pollution. Furthermore, a ban on thin bags will decimate the industry producing those bags, likely resulting in job losses for Kenyans, as was the case in South Africa when that country introduced similar legislation. However the report notes that this will be offset by increases in production of alternative bags, or in the recycling industry.\nMaking plastics.\nThe manufacture of plastic bags is a sizable industry. In the United States alone the film, sheet, and bag portion of the plastics industry produces more than $26 billion in sales in one year. The sheer number of plastic bags used are staggering, too: in Hong Kong more than a quarter of a billion bags get used every year, in San Francisco over 50 million, and almost 300 million in Kenya. The SPI \u2014 the parent organization of the Film and Bag Federation \u2014 claims that more than 80% of consumers reuse plastic bags as trash can liners or for similar purposes, but that's misleading even when restricted to the United States, as the number of bags used is still very high on a per-capita basis. According to the Worldwatch Institute, an independent environmental organization, Americans throw away 100 billion plastic bags every year, with only 0.6% of the bags being recycled.\nThe bag manufacturer association in the \u2014 the Film and Bag Federation \u2014 appears aware of environmental issues surrounding their products. The Federation's web site explores some environmental concerns, mainly recycling and reuse. But the issue of plastic bag overuse or excessive littering in developing countries is not addressed directly on their site.\nDonna Dempsey, the Executive Director of the Film and Bag Federation, said in an email to a Wikinews reporter that \"there are better ways in Kenya and other places to reduce the amount of bags used, such as re-educating the grocery bag checker not to double bag products and on the amount of groceries one bag is made to carry\". She said that members of the association \u2014 companies in the United States and \u2014 are investing millions of dollars into \"bag to bag\" recycling programs, which use material from recycled plastic bags to create new plastic bags, as well as programs that buy back recycled bags and turn them into plastic decking.\nSupport and opposition.\nThe government of Kenya has signaled that they support solutions to problems caused by plastic waste. At the opening speech of the UNEP Governing Council/Ministerial Environment Forum on Feb. 21, 2005, Kenya's President Mwai Kibaki said: \"In our major cities, plastic bags are used in large quantities at the household level. However, these bags are not disposed of in ways that ensure a clean environment. My country welcomes initiatives to address this problem.\" \nProf. Wangari Maathai, who is the country's deputy environment minister, supports the effort from her official position. She promotes the 4-Rs \u2014 Reduce, Recycle, Re-use, Repair \u2014 and encourages the use of locally-made cotton or sisal bags. Yet as the authors of the report write policy action must be fairly swift to be effective, so should the government commit to the report authors' recommendations it will have to quickly match political action with their words of support.\nPlastic bag pollution has been a contentious issue with the people of Kenya for a number of years. Six years ago, the Wildlife Clubs of Kenya organized a campaign march to urge the government to regulate the bag producers. But not everyone is optimistic about the plans to regulate plastic bags. Dave Jones from believes that the way to control pollution is to have clear policies on land ownership: \"No single land owner would allow his property to be polluted by others\" he writes in a letter to Kenya's daily newspaper, the Daily Nation. In after the bag regulations were implemented negative reactions included concerns that the poor already re-used the flimsy bags as source materials in producing home-made items such as hats or purses \u2014 occupations made impossible by the ban."}

Berlusconi's speech to parliament comes a day after his Foreign Minister, Gianfranco Fini made a similar speech to lawmakers, where he refuted Ms. Sgrena's claims that the shooting was the result of an ambush. \nThe US began their official investigation on March 8, four days after the shooting. The results are yet to be determined.\nHowever in a statement given immediately after the attack by the US Army's 3rd Infantry Division, who controls Baghdad, said that Italian officials had given no advance warning to the US Army of their journey, and that the car was speeding and refused to stop. One Army official stated that the car was traveling over 100 miles per hour (161 kilometers per hour) and almost hydroplaned several times, an assertion that Sgrena herself seemingly corroborated in her article for \"Il Manifesto\".\n\"The United States has no intention of evading the truth. I'm sure that in a very short time every aspect of this will be clarified.\" Mr Berlusconi said, describing the shooting as an \"accident.\" Adding that he expected the findings of an investigation into the shooting, being led by a US brigadier general, in cooperation with Italian authorities, to be released in three to four weeks.\nMeanwhile the office of Italian President Carlo Azeglio Ciampi said that it had received a letter from U.S. President George Bush saying that the shooting was a \"terrible tragedy\" and that \"President Bush assures President Ciampi that the United States will move toward a swift and exhaustive joint investigation.\"\nRecently, the Associated Press and the Italian RAI TGI television released photos of the car after the attack by American soldiers., The pictures show little visible damage to the vehicle. \nSgrena claims that the American soldiers fired between 300 and 400 rounds at the car from an armoured vehicle. This is disputed by the US military, as a tank or other fighting vehicle would likely have entirely destroyed the car."}

They signed this place on their maps,\" he said. \"But there was no contact, any kind of contact, between the Bulgarian battalion and the American radio post there.\"\nMr. Dobrev said Bulgarian and American military officials will meet in Baghdad Saturday to discuss how to improve coordination and the outcome of investigations by Bulgarians and two American teams.\nHe denied the incident has increased anti-American sentiment in Bulgaria, which is among several Eastern European countries supporting the US-led efforts in Iraq. Bulgaria has a 460-strong battalion in the Iraqi city of Diwaniya, serving under Polish command, and its mandate expires mid-2005.\nBulgarian soldier Gardev, who was buried Tuesday in his home village of Dolno Sahrane, was posthumously awarded the rank of candidate officer and received a medal for his apparent bravery in Iraq.\nHe died around the same time that American soldiers shot and killed an Italian intelligence agent, while also wounding an Italian journalist the agent had helped to rescue from insurgents. U.S. officials have expressed their regret over both incidents. On March 7, the Bulgarian government stated that Jr. Sgt. Gardi Gardev was killed by U.S. troops. \nOfficials from 1st Corps Support Command of the Multi-national Force Iraq are investigating the incident, and have said that they are committed to working with Bulgarian officials to discover what happened.\nSources.\n\"This article is based on a report by \"Voice of America News\", which is in the public domain.\""}

Melville threatened to issue a bench warrant for the arrest of world famous pop singer Michael Jackson if he failed to appear at the Santa Barbara County Superior Court in California Thursday Jan. 10, 2005. Jackson is under indictment there on seven counts of lewd and lascivious acts on a child under 14, and two counts of administering an intoxicating agent. Jackson, held briefly under the threat of jail by authorities on Nov. 20, 2003 when charges brought against him were formalized, gained his freedom later that day by posting a $3 million bail.\nJudge Melville, apparently frustrated with Jackson who had in two earlier instances caused delays in his court room, issued the warrant just 5 minutes after noting the singer\u2019s conspicuous absence at the scheduled 8:30 a.m. proceedings. Jackson's defense lawyer, Tom Mersereau Jr., advised the judge that Jackson awoke earlier that morning with severe back pain and was under treatment at an area hospital at the time. The judge moved to give the celebrity one hour to appear or face arrest for contempt of court.\nAs word of the warrant threat traveled to the large news presence gathered outside, a media countdown began. During the countdown, live televised reports recounted how Jackson had arrived for court 20 minutes late on his own arraignment for these charges, only to be met by a stern lecture from Judge Melville for that transgression. There was also another occasion where Jackson, while recovering from flu symptoms, delayed the trial's jury selection for a week until he was well enough to return. The glaringly clear message sent by the judge was: bad back or not, Jackson was to appear in court! And fast! Only the televised scene of Jackson's expectant defense lawyer Mersereau with his assistant Susan Yu, both busy on cells phones while tensely waiting curbside beside the court house for the Jackson motorcade, seemed to undermine a feeling that Jackson would make it in time to avoid having his bail revoked.\nAs the deadline came and passed without Jackson\u2019s arrival, live reports were busy with speculation on the superstar persona of Michael Jackson then taking on newer aspects of super-bizarre. But Jackson\u2019s flair for tardiness showed itself with an arrival that was a mere 3 minutes after the judge was being forced to make good on his threat. Dressed in a blue blazer over a light weight undershirt, the star's recent departure from the hospital was evident by the pajama bottom pants and open-heeled bedroom slippers he wore into the court room.\nJackson had the assistance of his father and a body guard at each side to keep him steady as he gingerly walked into the Santa Maria court house. He listed slightly to the right and kept a fixed, distant face that was surrounded by uncombed strands of his long hair. The summons issued by the judge forced Jackson from his hospital bed to show the world he was not above the law. \nIn private chambers, Judge Melville met with both the prosecution lawyer, Tom Sneddon, and Jackson\u2019s defense lawyer to verify the defendant\u2019s claims of back pain. After re-taking the bench in the court room, the judge announced to the jury they would proceed with the docket as planned. Mr. Jackson narrowly escaped prison, and the trial would continue where it left off on the previous day with direct testimony from the now 15 year old boy who accuses him."}

Chess is battles, chess is struggles.\" said the longtime world champion Garry Kasparov at the height of his career. In a surprise announcement Friday, the grandmaster said he will retire. He went public with his intentions from , Spain after winning a prestigious tournament there. The news comes as Kasparov, now 41, declared an ambition to devote his energy into the politics of his native Russia.\nAlternately known as brash, emotional and brilliant, the maverick Kasparov could be a formidable opponent in the realm of politics. He will partner with the Russian group known as the Committee 2008 (Komitet 2008), whose members are attempting to influence the 2008 Russian election that will replace Putin. The champion said he also wants to write books, with chess being among the subjects, but he will not play any more at the professional level.\nAlways mercurial in defeat, Kasparov lost his final game in tournament play in a stunning upset by of Bulgaria. The upset did not take away his victory at the tournament, but his announcement came after being bitterly stung in defeat. \nAt age 22, Kasparov became the youngest person ever to hold the title of world champion when he won it from fellow Russian, Anatoly Karpov, in 1985. The two players dominated the field until infighting in 1993 caused Kasparov to break away from the (FIDE) and form the (PCA). In this forum he defeated British challenger . For a period of time, Kasparov, of the PCA, and Karpov, who reclaimed the top spot of the FIDE, both claimed to be world champions. However, the ratings system developed by FIDE held that Kasparov was the stronger player. The PCA eventually fell apart in 1995.\nIn 1996, Kasparov was at the top of his game, when a team led by IBM introduced , the strongest of a new class of chess playing computers. In a highly publicized face-off of man vs. machine, Kasparov won the 6 game match. A year later, against an enhanced version of Deep Blue, he lost.

It placed the Inmarsat 4 F-1 communications satellite into orbit. This was Lockheed-Martin's second try to launch the satellite. Yesterday's attempt ended in a scrub when the flight control computer passed a red-line with less than three minutes remaining in the countdown.\nThis was the fifth launch of the Atlas V vehicle, and the first launch where the rocket used three of the first stage, Aerojet built, solid rocket motors. It also had the narrower 4 meter payload fairing. \nFor the first part of the flight, the rocket was powered by a common booster core with two RD-180 rocket engines plus three solid rocket motors. When their fuel was expended the solid rocket motors burned out and were jettisoned. \nThe common booster core then continued pushing the payload and upper stage, with its two RD-180 engines producing 806,000lbf of thrust. The common booster core expended its fuel around four and a half minutes into the flight. At this point the first stage common booster core separated from the upper stage and payload.\nAfter the stage separation, the Centaur upper stage started its engine and burned for nearly ten minutes. During this burn, the payload fairing separated from the spacecraft, leaving the satellite exposed on the nose of the rocket in the vacuum of space. When the ten minute burn was up, the Centaur coasted with the satellite for another ten minutes waiting to get to the optimal point for the final burn. At around 24 minutes into the flight, the final burn of the Centaur stage occurred, placing the spacecraft in a super-synchronous transfer orbit. After this burn was complete, the Centaur separated, leaving the spacecraft on its own. \nNow the spacecraft must attempt to open its solar arrays and place itself in the final . Because of this special type of orbit, where the spacecraft goes around once every 24 hours, the satellite will appear to sit in one place over the equator. From this location, Inmarsat will use it to provide BGAN (Broadband Global Area Network) which is a 3G compatible, 432kbit/s data service, to much of the world. \nThe Atlas vehicle was rolled out of its vertical integration facility 1800 feet from the launch pad early yesterday morning (before the first launch attempt). The reason for this launch day move is because of the clean pad concept. \nPast American rockets (with the exception of the Saturns and Space Shuttles) have always been assembled on the launch pad. In the case of a delay in launching, this would cause delays in all the rockets that needed to be launched after the one that experienced the delay. With the new clean pad concept, rockets can be assembled and checked out before being moved to the pad, saving delays in the schedule. \nThe launch tower and rocket move out to the pad along a set of railroad tracks, making the 1800 foot journey in approximately half an hour, topping out around two miles per hour. \nBecause of the clean pad concept, none of the launch control electronics or spacecraft environmental systems are on the pad. Instead, they are run along the railroad tracks with the rocket as it moves to the pad on launch day. When they get there, they slide into concrete enclosures so that they are not destroyed during the rocket launch. "}

{"id": "5681", "revid": "70202", "url": "https://en.wikinews.org/wiki?curid=5681", "title": "US Senate passes new bankruptcy bill", "text": "In a vote of 74-25 last Thursday, the US Senate passed a measure that would change laws, making it harder for individuals seeking relief from their debt burden to avoid repayment. Almost twenty Democrats joined Republicans, who currently hold a majority of the seats in the US Senate, in passing the bill.\nLobbyists for credit card companies and financial services firms have worked for the bill during the last two administrations. A similar measure passed both the Senate and House during the previous administration, but then President Bill Clinton the measure in 2000.\nAmendments defeated.\nDemocrats sought to soften the bill by allowing bankruptcy filers to negotiate directly with lenders for relief, but the amendments were defeated by the Republican-controlled Senate. Proponents of the bill claim the rise of bankruptcy filings to nearly 1.5 million a year shows that abusers of credit use the filings to shield themselves from irresponsible practices.\n\"There has been an explosion of bankruptcy,\" said Iowa Republican Sen. Charles E. Grassley, the bill's sponsor. \"We preserve the principle of a fresh start, but we also establish a principle that if you have the ability to repay some of your debt, you are not going to get off scot-free.\" However, Massachusetts Democratic Sen., said, \"This legislation makes the bankruptcy courts of the United States the collection agency for the credit-card industry.\" \nThe bill impacts a broad spectrum of law, but the most significant impact is on personal bankruptcy filings. Individuals who get behind in repaying credit card debt face high interest charges and stiff late payment fees. By only meeting minimum payment requirements, borrowers remit to the lender over the life of the loan an amount in interest and other fees that can far exceed the value of the principal balance of the loan. This can put consumers who run up high balances on various cards at financial risk of default. Critics of the bill blame these aggressive lending practices as a contributing factor in the rising trend of bankruptcy filings from 1996.\nDebt from medical bills also affected.\nThe proposed bill doesn't only affect debtors with credit card debt.\nIt also affects debtors who have run up large medical bills.\nPatients with a past medical history that disqualifies them from full medical coverage, can easily find themselves facing insurmountable medical bills after just a short stay in the hospital. These individuals will no longer be able to get a fresh start after these personal disasters, and will be forced to live in poverty until they can pay off their medical bills as part of their Chapter 13 filing. (Prior to this bill, they would have been able to file Chapter 7, completely discharging their debt.)\n, which accounts for 70% of bankruptcy filings, allows individuals to eliminate most non-secured debts after liquidating assets, with the notable exemption of one's principle residence in most states. The Senate passed bill would change Chapter 7 eligibility by applying a means-test, where those with a median income higher than the state average would be required to file under provisions. Under Chapter 13 protection, an individual's debt is not forgiven; rather it is restructured for payment under more lenient terms.\nAttorney client privilege and insurance affected.\nThis was the first major overhaul of federal bankruptcy law in many years.\nUnder the old bankruptcy law, a personal bankruptcy attorney could not be held financially responsible for his clients mendacity. Under the new bankruptcy law, the bankruptcy attorney is responsible for his client's lies to the Court about his assets and the bankruptcy attorney and his insurance carrier can be held responsible by the Bankruptcy Court.\nThe result is that personal attorneys (this does not apply to corporate bankruptcy attorneys) are likely to flee the personal bankruptcy field when the new law takes effect. Their companies will not offer the sort of coverage that they would need to continue to practice. \nSo when consumers need to file personal bankruptcy under the new law, they will be unlikely to find a bankruptcy attorney to represent them. Consumers will have to file pro se: such consumers will be likely to fail due to the complexity of the law.\nThe bottom line is that the field of personal bankruptcy law as a practice area of law will cease to exist when the new bankruptcy law takes effect, and consumers will be unable to secure legal counsel and so consumers will lose what legal protections counsel now affords them.\nPrison population affected.\nUnder the new bankruptcy law about one half million Americans will be forest to pay for at lest 5 years on longer they will be held in servitude as chattel they will be completely subservient to a dominating influence of the company that holds the loan. Their loan will be put on the market for sale for profit. The people will be forced to work harder. People who fail to go to court will have a arrest warrant made out in their name and people who refuse\nto pay. They will be subject to fines and or jail. About fifty thousand Americans will punished by a fine and or about three \nthousand Americans every year will go to jail under the new bankruptcy law. For some people this will be a third strike they will be put in jail for life.\nHouse vote up next.\nThe bill has the support of President Bush, and its passage in the House sometime next month seems likely. If enacted into law, lending companies will recover more money on what otherwise would be written off as bad loans. Those persons of median and higher income seeking relief would be required to file under Chapter 13 status and pay up to $100 per month under court imposed conditions. It is expected the proposed changes would cause a sharp increase in filings before the new law could take effect."}

Roed-Larson met with the leader at his Aleppo home late last week for talks on Syrian intentions of following the UN Security Council Resolution 1559.\nThe US and French backed resolution calls for the complete withdrawal of Syrian forces from Lebanon and reaffirms Lebanon's sovereignty and independence. It is hoped that the withdrawal will be completed prior to the Lebanese election scheduled for early May.\nA complete plan and time table for full withdrawal is not yet known. White House national security advisor, Stephen Hadley, said the United States is waiting for details of the meeting with the special envoy. According to a report in the Washington Post, the first part of a pull-out calls for one third of the troops to be either removed or relocated into eastern Bekaa Valley and to shut down intelligence headquarters in Beirut by the end of March. Then on April 7, a Lebanese-Syrian military commission will meet to discuss the removal of additional forces.\nThe Washington administration seems prepared to accept a Syrian withdrawal in phases, but is cautious of al-Assad's pledges. Hadley said on a 'Fox News Sunday' broadcast interview: \"In the end of the day, it's going to be deeds, not words, that matter.\"\nThe assassination of Lebanese former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri on Feb. 14 galvanized anti-Syrian opposition and foreign pressure that was calling for an end to the Syrian presence. It is estimated their total military force is now 15,000, with an additional 5,000 intelligence assets, down from a high of 40,000 during years of Syrian involvement. Syria occupied Lebanon beginning in 1976 when the country was at civil war. Associated Press and US intelligence reported significant troop movements out of Lebanon beginning in earnest last week amid differing protest groups in Beirut who marched both for, and alternately against, the Syrian involvement."}

The information was reported by the Brazilian magazine Veja that circulates this week in a headline story called \"FARC's tentacles in Brazil\".\nAccording to the magazine, reporters had access to documents of Abin that described the liaisons between the Workers' Party (PT) and the Colombian guerrilla movement FARC.\nThe Workers' Party (PT) is the party of the Brazilian President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva. PT is one of the biggest left-wing parties in Latin America and at this moment the strongest and more organized party from Brazil. It is one of the political Brazilian parties that has the biggest and most active militancy.\nAbin's main document, number 0095/3100 of April 25, 2002, says that a meeting occurred on April 13, 2002, in a farm near Brasilia. The meeting lasted about 6 hours, there were approximately 30 persons, among them the father Oliv\u00e9rio Medina, one of the representatives of the FARC in Brazil, and members of PT. A disguised Abin's agent participated of this meeting and annoted everything.\nAccording to the agent, during the meeting, father Medina announced that he would donate 5 million dollars for politicians' electoral campaign of his choice.\nAbin agency has six documents that describe the liaisons between PT and the FARC. Among the six documents, 3 of them say explicitly that 5 million dollars donation for PT's candidates occurred. The money probably came from Trinidad and Tobago and went to 300 Brazilian businessmen who distributed the quantity among the party's committees.\nAnother document says that the Brazilian Congress employee and former-militant of the Brazilian Communist Party (PCdoB), Maria das Gra\u00e7as organized the meetings with FARC members. She is considered a personal friend of the FARC commander knows as Mauricio. Maria said: \"I know him [the commander Mauricio] off course, and so what? I did not organize any meeting.\"\nThe militant Antonio Viana who was in the meeting said: \"We have talked about everything, except money.\"\nThe Colombian Radio Caracol says that, according to a research done by the Colombian government, the FARC invests next to 476 million pesos per years in activities in foreign countries. The official FARC representatives for this work are: Luis Alberto Alb\u00e1n, Ovidio Salinas, Ricardo Morantes, Jairo Alfonso Lesmes, father Oliverio Medina, Jes\u00fas Carvajalino and Liliana L\u00f3pez. Father Oliv\u00e9rio Medina is the name of who would be responsible for the intermediation between members of political parties in Brazil and the FARC.\nSometime ago, the Brazilian Deputy Alberto Fraga (PTB) knew about the Abin's investigation and denounced the scheme during a speech on the Brazilian Congress. In addition, he tried to open a commission to investigate the matter. Nevertheless he did not obtain support to open the commission. The PT deputy Luis Eduardo Grenhalg told him that he might be processed by government if he continued on commenting about the subject, says Fraga. Grenhalg says that he only suggested for Fraga not spreading informations that were not real. \nThe PSDB candidate Jos\u00e9 Serra tryed to talk about the FARC-PT liaison during the 2002 presidential campaign. However he was punished by the Electoral Court at that time.\nThe Workers' Party (PT) released an official statement signed by the National President Jos\u00e9 Genoino repudiating the magazine's article and denying all presented facts. Part of the note tells:\nThe note says that the article is irresponsible, that it comments on facts without any sustentable evidence. It still says that the magazine denies itself when later in the text it affirms that it did not find any solid indication to proof that 5 million dollars were really sent to PT by the FARC.\nThe note affirms that this kind of insinuation is not new and the party was already a victim of it before. It says that during the 2002 presidential campaign the candidate Jos\u00e9 Serra (PSDB) was punished because his denunce was empty. The documents commented by the magazine date of April 25, 2002, epoch in which the Brazilian president was Fernando Henrique Cardoso. At that time there were many spies searching and collecting, like snakes, for situations that could prevent the free desire of the Brazilian people to vote for the changes.\nSome members of the National Congress are trying to begin a official investigation.\nThis is the second time, this year, that a South American government is criticized for alleged supporting relations with the FARC. Last month, Colombia and Venezuela almost entered in a war because of the arrestment of the alleged FARC's chancellor Rodrigo Granda. Colombia accused the government of Venezuela of giving protection and support to FARC's guerrillas. Venezuela accused Colombia of hurting his sovereignty. The two countries only entered an agreement after the intervention of the president of Cuba Fidel Castro.\nAlso this is the second time, in less than a month, that a political party from South America is accused of implication with the FARC. On February, Paraguayan authorities discovered Cecilia Cubas Gusinky's body, 31 years, daughter kidnapped of the former-president of Paraguay Raul Cubas in a hole, in \u00d1emby, 29 km from the capital Asuncion. Members of the party P\u00e1tria Livre were living in that place and they were considered to be the main suspects. Osmar Mart\u00ednez, that belongs to the party, was arrested. According to the police, some time ago he had communicated by email with the FARC chancellor Rodrigo Granda. In a interview Martinez said that he supports a \"brotherhood relation\" with the FARC.\nThe presence of the FARC in Brazil.\nA note from the Workers' Party (PT), of February 16, 2002 called \n\"The truth about Colombia and the FARC - and PT\" tries to clarify the relationship between the party and the FARC. A portion of this note says that:\nThe note also criticizes the decision taken during the previous government, of Fernando Henrique Cardoso, which did not recognized the Colombian guerrillas of the FARC diplomatically. According to the note that would not be a good idea, since the FARC could win the war against Colombia.\nThe note criticizes the support of the government of the United Sates to Colombia and affirms that with it the conflict tends to remain more violent and last more. In relation to the drugs, the note affirms that the PT is emphatic in the combat against the drug traffic. Nevertheless it says that there are credit \"contradictory informations\" relating to the implication of the FARC with the drug traffic.\nThe PT refuses to classify the FARC as a terrorist organization. The party justifies the decision saying that it can act as mediator in the conflict, this way.\nThe FARC is member of Foro de S\u00e3o Paulo since 1990. According to the first forum final resolution, on July 4, 1990, the forum goal is \"to improve proposals of united and consensual acctions\".\nRaul Reyes, FARC commander described part of the FARC relationship during an interview for the Brazilian newspaper Folha de S\u00e3o Paulo on August 24, 2003 . In the interview he said that he knew the Brazilian president Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula for the first time in San Salvador during the Foro de S\u00e3o Paulo. The FARC commander affirms that the main contacts in Brazil are the ones in the Worker's Party (PT) and in the Landless Workers' Movement (MST). He says that FARC has contacts among intellectuals, Catholic priests, historians and journalists. Among them there are Carlos Alberto Lib\u00e2nio Christo or Frei Betto (former Lula advisor) and Emir Sader (writer). Also he says that the affirmation that the FARC produce cocaine is untrue.\nThe Brazilian drug dealer Luiz Fernando da Costa, also known as Fernandinho Beira-Mar, was arrested by Colombian army on April, 2001 in the city of Maramduba, in Colombia. With him there was also arrested the FARC leader, Acacio Medina, or Negro Ac\u00e1cio \u2014 O Estado de S\u00e3o Paulo, on April 21, 2001.\nIn Brasilia, Beira-Mar was interrogated by DEA agents. Beira-Mar talked about his liaisons with the Colombian guerrillas. The recording of this conversation was a key factor so the US government could request later the extradition of three other FARC guerrillas. Some details of this meeting were published by the Colombian magazine Cambio \nAccording to Beira-Mar, he was buying 600 kilos of coca, per week, for two million pesos from peasants. He was paying to the FARC a million pesos for every processed kilo. He also said that he was giving weapons to the Colombian guerrillas.\nFARC and ELN delegates act in schools, labour unions and Brazilian universities spreading ideas about the revolutionary movement. \nSome of these meetings are organized by left-wing groups. One of the most\nactive of these groups is the \"Permanent Committee of Solidarity with the People in Fight\". The committee organized more than 40 lectures in S\u00e3o Paulo\naccording to the President of the USP Workers Labour Union \nOn August, 2001, representatives of the FARC, took part of a meeting with the members of the Socialistic Youth of PDT .\nOn March 20, 2002 in Ribeir\u00e3o Preto, a pro-FARC committee was created by the secretary of sports at that time Leopoldo Paulino (PSB), during the government of Mayor Ant\u00f4nio Palocci Filho (PT). Palocci is the current Minister of the Finance , \nDuring a interview to the Brazilian television channel EPTV, yesterday, Leopoldo Paulino said that the comitte did not aim collect founds to the Colombian guerrilla. He said that the committee is of solidarity with Latin American people, engaged and militant. He said that he doesn't think that the FARC need any other extra financial support. Paulino said he has empathy by the guerrilla because they fight against the United States. He also said that he did not take part of the meeting described by the Brazilian magazine and that he don't know father Olivera Medina. \nOn 2001, FARC commanders were received by the governor (at that time) of Rio Grande do Sul, Olivio Dutra (PT) ,\n. FARC leaders were honored and acclaimed during the World Social Forum in Porto Alegre. Ol\u00edvido Dutra is the current Minister of Cities. At that occasion, deputies of Rio Grande do Sul Congress protested against Olivio. \nBrazilian press.\nThe Brazilian press already have published stories about the relationship between the FARC and the Workers' Party (PT). But, none of these previous stories was so emphatic as the recent one published by the magazine Veja, this week.\nHowever the magazine Veja is cautious saying that although all the people and the dates cited by the Abin agents were correct \"the magazine did not find solid evidences to proof that PT received money from the FARC\". \nIn the story, the magazine did not detail the participation of the FARC on the Foro de S\u00e3o Paulo, neither its activities in Brazil. \nFARC and PT have been in contact at least for about 12 years at least, since the FARC joined to the Foro de S\u00e3o Paulo in 1990. Foro de S\u00e3o Paulo was founded after the falling of Berlin wall by Brazilian Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva and the Cuban President Fidel Castro.\nAmerica Libre is the name of a magazine published by some participants of the Foro de S\u00e3o Paulo. The America Libre magazine publishing conseaul is formed by PT members and other Brazilian personalities: Luis Eduardo Greenhalgh (PT), Fernando Morais, Emir Sader, Roberto Drummond, Gilberto Carvalho, Leonardo Boff, Rubens Paolucci Jr, Jo\u00e3o Pedro St\u00e9dile (MST leader), Chico Buarque de Hollanda (singer), etc. Also part of the publishing council is the FARC commander Manuel Marulanda V\u00e9lez (Tirofijo). . The former-president of the publishing council was Carlos Alberto Lib\u00e2nio Christo, know as Frei Betto, former Lula's personal advisor and journalist.\nActivities of the Foro de S\u00e3o Paulo usually are not not mentioned by Brazilian media. Even the story of magazine Veja this week didn't say the name Foro de S\u00e3o Paulo. Instead the magazine preferred to use \"a debate with political parties and social organizations of Latin America and of Caribe to discuss the effects of the fall of the wall of Berlin.\" Rarely the name Foro de S\u00e3o Paulo is mentioned by Brazilian news agencies. \nSome journalists already denied the existence of the Foro de S\u00e3o Paulo. Luiz Felipe de Alencastro already wrote articles for the magazine Veja. He is Brazilian History professor in the University of Paris. In October 30, 2002, during a talk for the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) in Washington, a participant asked Alencastro about the Foro de S\u00e3o Paulo. Alencastro answered: \"It's interesting. You'll see, because I live, I mean, I live now in France. I had been living in Brazil for 12 years. We never heard about this Foro de S\u00e3o Paulo in Brazil.\"\nDocuments about the Foro de S\u00e3o Paulo can be find in left-wing party websites.\n, \n. PT talks about the Foro de S\u00e3o Paulo in its documents \nAt the website of the Perseu Abramo Foundation, organization founded by PT, there is the speech of the President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva during the meeting of the Foro de S\u00e3o Paulo in Havana, Cuba. \nAn article published in the Communist Party of Brazil (PCdoB) official webpage by the journalist and Vice-president of PCdoB Jos\u00e9 Reinaldo Carvalho called \"S\u00e3o Paulo Forum - the convergence point of the Latin-American and Caribbean left\" talks about the Foro. PCdoB is an ally and the party participates on the government .\nIn 2004, a group of journalist sent a proposal to the Brazilian president Lula asking for the creation of an inspector organism to control the conduct of the Brazilian press. This organ would have power, according to the proposal, to censure journalistic works considered inappropriate. Journalists could lost their professional licenses. , , , . \nThe proposal was considered too authoritarian by other journalists who protested against it emphatically. The law had no support for its creation, in spite of the pressure exercised by the government, and by some journalistic sectors supporting the proposal \nOne of the critics against the proposal was that the journalists who supported the idea (and that would be the ones who would fiscalize the media) were members of PT or PCdoB."}

Kramer struck down two California laws that limited marriage in the state to a union of opposite-sex couples. The ruling came one year after when it opened its city hall to same-sex weddings over Valentine's Day weekend through March 11 2004.\nKramer said the two California laws violated the state's constitutional guarantees of privacy and a legal concept called due process - which tries to ensure each person is treated equally by the law. \"The denial of marriage to same-sex couples appears impermissibly arbitrary,\" Kramer wrote in the opinion released Monday.\nIn his decision, Kramer cited United States Supreme Court case law ranging from ' to ' in a step-by-step dismantling of legal arguments against same-sex marriage. Including the following excerpts:\nKramer, a Catholic Republican Judge appointed by , California's previous conservative governor, issued a \"stay\" on his order, making it a tentative decision by delaying its implementation for 60 days to allow the same-sex marriage opponents time to file an appeal to his ruling. The case is widely expected to be brought before the California Supreme Court.\nLess than a year ago, the state's Supreme Court annulled more than 4,000 same-sex marriages which took place in San Francisco County in 2004. The court did not rule on the constitutionality of same-sex marriages, but ruled more narrowly that San Francisco mayor Gavin Newsom overstepped his authority by unilaterally deciding not to follow state laws he did not agree with instead of challenging the laws in court, which is the proper legal way to overturn or affirm laws in California and much of the United States."}

The draft version of the law mandates that the Taiwanese President must report to the legislature on any such actions within thirty days.\nDPP caucus whip Peter Lin said that although the signatures of only thirty lawmakers are required to make the law valid, over fifty have already been gathered.\nThe seven-article draft law states that the Taiwan issue is not a part of China's internal affairs, but rather that it is an international matter between nations. It goes on to state that it is necessary and urgent to quickly enact counter-legislation to deter Mainland China's annexation efforts. It further calls for increased trust and understanding between the two sides, including greater trade, sporting, and cultural links.\nThe Taiwanese Solidarity Union also proposed a new \"anti-annexation\" law. The eleven article draft states that \"Taiwan is already an independent sovereign state and it is not an issue for Taiwan to declare independence or seek separation from China\". It goes on to state that the government should call a referendum to amend the Taiwanese constitution to safeguard Taiwanese sovereignty. The draft law would also give the Taiwanese President authorisation to resort to \"non-peaceful means\" to resist Chinese aggression.\nTaiwanese independence has been a thorny issue in recent years, as some Taiwanese politicians insist that the democratic island is a sovereign nation, and Chinese authorities insist that it is a part of the PRC."}

Chinese President Hu Jintao quickly signed a presidential order to bring the law into effect.\nThe law provides a legal basis for China to use force, or \"nonpeaceful means\" as the Chinese government has phrased it, against Taiwan, should reunification efforts fail. \nChinese premier Wen Jiabao stressed that the legislation is aimed at achieving peace in the Taiwan Straits. \nSpeaking at a press conference following the law's passage, Wen stated, \"This law is meant to strengthen and promote cross-straits relations. This law is for peaceful reunification. It is not targeted against the people of Taiwan, nor is it a war bill.\"\n\"This law is to contain and oppose Taiwan separatist forces. Only by containing and opposing Taiwan separatist forces can the Taiwan Straits have peace,\" he added. \nThe vote was broadcast live on state-controlled television and radio. The Chinese Xinhua news agency has taken the unusual step of setting up a special section on its Internet site to explain the law and its ramifications from the Chinese perspective.\nChinese officials describe PRC policy as being committed to peace to the maximum extent possible, while acknowledging limits to peaceful negotiation. A Xinhua headline from the days leading up to the law's passage declares, \"China Pursues Peace, But Not at Any Price.\" \nWang Zhaoguo of the National People's Congress previously stated on March 8, \"Using non-peaceful means to stop secession in defense of our sovereignty and territorial integrity would be our last resort, when all our efforts for a peaceful reunification prove futile.\" Added Wang, \"No one is more desirous of achieving a peaceful reunification than we are.\"\nTaiwanese politicians reacted with strongly-worded \"anti-invasion\" legislation, and vowed to call a one-million strong rally in opposition to the new law. \nThe timing of the legislation comes at a delicate moment for U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, who is making her first trip to China in a few days.\n\"We do view the adoption of the anti-secession law as something that is unfortunate and not helpful to encouraging peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait,\" said White House spokesman Scott McClellan."}

There were few surprises that had not already been indicated in his 2004 pre-Budget report. The increase in the threshold on stamp duty was greater than that forecast by commentators, as was the amount of the Council Tax rebate to households with pensioners.\nThe Budget in detail.\nDuty.\nBefore the speech, commentators had speculated that the Chancellor would increase the threshold for stamp duty on house purchases from \u00a360,000 to \u00a3100,000 (the same increase that the Liberal Democrats had proposed in their Alternative Budget in February 2005), to reflect the increase in house prices over the past few years and to reduce the burden on first-time house buyers; and would not increase the duty on petrol.

Mr Howard stated that he agreed with the Prime Minister that this would be \"the last Budget that this Chancellor will ever deliver\".\nMr Howard began by welcoming \"the Chancellor back to the General Election campaign\", and throughout his response made frequent references to the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster. He stated that the Conservative Party's policy would be to give pensioners a \u00a3500 council tax rebate in 2005.\nExpanding upon his \"vote now, pay later\" theme, Mr Howard stated that \"this Chancellor has got form\", describing Mr Brown's 2001 pre-election Budget as \"a vote now Budget\" and Mr Brown's 2002 post-election Budget as \"a pay later Budget\". Mr Howard also questioned the accuracy of the forecasts in the Budget report, accusing it of being a \"dodgy Budget based upon dodgy numbers\", and pointed to Mr Brown's Budget reports in previous years where the forecast in the Budget report had been for a surplus of \u00a358 billions but where there had actually turned out to be a deficit of \u00a341 billions. Mr Howard accused \"the Chancellor's forecasts of surpluses\" of being as unreliable as \"the Prime Minister's forecasts of Weapons of Mass Destruction\".\nLiberal Democrat.\nIn a speech lasting 15 minutes, the leader of the Liberal Democrat Party, the Right Honourable Charles Kennedy MP, emphasized themes of \"social justice\" and \"fairness\", and contrasted Liberal Democrat Budgetary policies with those of the Labour Party and of the Conservative Party. \nMr Kennedy began by pointing to the \"favourable backdrop\" against which Mr Brown was publishing his Budget, stating that one of the reasons for the favourable economic circumstances was the implementation by the Labour Party of the Liberal Democrat policy of an independent Bank of England.\nAccusing Mr Howard and Mr Brown of engaging in a \"Dutch auction\" with respect to Council Tax rebates for pensioners, and of both ignoring the \"ticking bomb\" of Council Tax revaluation that would markedly affect people's Council Tax bills, Mr Kennedy stated the Liberal Democrat policy of scrapping the Council Tax entirely and of instead bringing in a system of local Income taxation. Mr Kennedy characterized the Council Tax rebates as a \"quick fix for this year only\", and contrasted this with local Income taxation which he characterized as being one that \"pensioners benefit from every year\". Mr Kennedy also questioned why the National Audit Office would not have \"access to Mr Brown's books\", for checking the assumptions made in the Budget report, until the end of the year.\nFurther outlining the Liberal Democrat aims for \"social justice\" and \"fairness\", Mr Kennedy accused the State Pension system of being one that is \"iniquitous\" for women, whom he said both lose National Insurance credit as the result of time taken off work for starting and raising families and who have to rely upon the State Pension more because of their greater life expectancy. Mr Kennedy also stated that the poorest 20% of people in Britain pay more, as a proportion of their income, than do the richest 20% of people.\nMr Kennedy concluded by pointing to the lack of any mention of the environment in Mr Brown's speech, which he termed a glaring \"sin of omission\", and by describing the Liberal Democrat presentation of its taxation and spending policies as being one of \"That's who'll pay it. That's what it will cost. That's who'll benefit.\", and accused the Labour Party of, by contrast, making pre-election promises in the past to not raise Income tax, only instead to raise National Insurance contributions after the election."}

Liquid water is believed to be a key ingredient for life, therefore the presence of water on Mars helps support chances of extraterrestrial life, reported the journal Nature today. In the studies, strong indications of glacial and volcanic activity were presented. The combined research on this subject, including a study in December 2004 indicating that five volcanoes were active as recently as two million years ago, justifies further search for signs of life on Mars scientists say.\nA few million years is a mere minute on the geological timescale of Mars which has been around for 4.5 billion years.\nThe scarred surface of Mars cannot be attributed solely to asteroids. New images of the landscape taken by the High Resolution Stereo Camera (HRSC) on the European Space Agency's Mars Express Mission show that flowing water, large glaciers and active volcanoes have also taken their toll on the face of Mars.\nSome evidence collected by two Mars rovers that NASA sent to explore the planet shows that Mars was hotter and more humid millions of years ago than it is today. Also important were active volcanoes that can stimulate the forming of microbial life as they do here on Earth. Scientists recently discovered bacteria near the mouths of undersea volcanic vents on Earth where bacteria live off sulfur instead of oxygen and discharge methane as a by-product of their life cycle. Though controversial, the discovery of signs of methane gas in Mars' atmosphere also interests researchers who believe it indicates the possibility of subsurface life.\nGeologist James Head of Brown University led a group of researchers who examined landforms thought to be glacial during the Viking program in the 1970s. They found evidence that glaciers moved from the poles to the equator between 3.5 and 4 million years ago, suggesting that Mars is currently in an interglacial period. \nA third study looked at an area of frozen water roughly the size of the North Sea that formed near the equator around five million years ago. It is now thought that the ice was once liquid water carried along by volcanic eruptions in a region known as Cerberus Fossae.\nResearchers have long assumed water on Mars had all evaporated into the Martian atmosphere. A 1991 hypothesis, then considered outrageous by suggesting Mars was no stranger to floods, is now supported by recent findings. The HRSC data suggests water is still present both in liquid form and ice. Mars Express will deploy a special radar instrument in early May which should be able to detect water and ice even several miles beneath the surface.\nShould water be found on Mars, the chances of finding life are great. Many extremophiles, bacteria living under extreme conditions such as extreme salinity or heat, have already been discovered on Earth. In February 2005, scientists announced the discovery of bacteria that survived in a state of frozen suspension for 32,000 years. \nLikewise on Mars, a sample of ice could offer great insight into the evolution of the Martian environment and atmosphere. These discoveries may offer a great chance to get objective evidence for Mars research."}

Zo\u00eb detected signs of chlorophyll, DNA and protein, which are strong indications of life. Scientists then gathered visual evidence from the pictures taken by Zo\u00eb. The research was presented this week at the 36th Lunar and Planetary Science Conference in Houston, Texas. The study was led by Nathalie Cabrol, a planetary scientist at NASA\u2019s Ames Research Center.\nOne of the important new features developed for Zo\u00eb is a fluorescence imager in the shadow under its belly that can be used in daytime. This tool scans for chlorophyll-based-life that would otherwise be rendered undetectable by sunlight. Zo\u00eb also carries a spectrometer that scans for chlorophyll using visible and near-infrared light.\nZo\u00eb searched for signs of life in coastal and inland regions of the Atacama Desert between August and October of 2004. She was remote conrolled from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania while a ground crew followed her to verify her detections.\nWith studies suggesting the existence of life on Mars, the new system may soon see implementation.

Mahabalipuram is a port city of South India, dating back to the 7th century, around 60 km south from the city of Chennai in Tamil Nadu.\nThe fishermen reported a complex consisting of ancient temples. Some mention seeing at least 20 distinct temples, and hundreds of refrigerator-sized blocks. The walls were covered with barnacles, coral and mud. Local folklore tells of an ancient port in the area.\nOn the shore, three structures consisting of elaborate carvings in the shape of animals were uncovered. The structures appear to have been covered in sand, which had been wiped away by the force of the tsunami. The structures appear to belong to a port city built in the 7th century, said T.

Until that happens, there \"wasn't any hope at all\" of progress to restore the institutions of government to Northern Ireland. He added that the McCartney sisters \"remarkable campaign\" had \"personalised the issue of criminal activity\" and given a face to individuals suffering from brutality and savagery.\nGerry Adams said the case has become steeped in politics, and the only people that could not be accused of political motivation were the McCartney sisters themselves. \nReported separately, the controversial 'detention-without-trial orders', brought in last week under the Prevention of Terrorism Act, could be used against members of the IRA. The government has refused to rule out the possibility of control orders being used on members of the group. Home Secretary Charles Clarke has said that the orders had been working well in their first few days although there had been some teething problems. "}

This is the first such discovery by Cassini, other than Titan, of the presence of an atmosphere around a Saturn moon.\nEnceladus's gravity is too weak to hold an atmosphere around the planet, leading scientists to believe that volcanism, geysers, or gases escaping from the surface or the interior as a continuous source for the atmosphere.\nThe atmosphere was detected using a magnetometer during two close flybys of Enceladus on February 17 and March 9. The magnetometer is used to measure the magnitude and direction of magnetic fields surrounding Saturn and its moons. The magnetometer detected a bending of Saturn's magnetic field around the moon, indicating the Saturnian plasma is being diverted away from an extended atmosphere. The observations from the Enceladus flybys are believed to be due to ionized water vapor.\n\"These new results from Cassini may be the first evidence of gases originating either from the surface or possibly from the interior of Enceladus,\" said Dr. Michele Dougherty, principal investigator for the Cassini magnetometer and professor at Imperial College in London.\nScientists have suspected Enceladus as geologically active and a possible source of Saturn's icy E ring.

Similar snails have been seen in four American states, including at least nine Florida counties, and Indonesia.\nApple snails (those of the \"ampullariidae\" family) are tropical and sub-tropical freshwater snails. They are named for their round shell, which is apple shaped. The channeled apple snail (\"Pomacea canaliculata\") has a yellow-to-brown shell that may grow to the size of a baseball. Unlike many other freshwater gastropods, Apple Snails have both a lung and a gill. This allows them to live even in oxygen-poor waters. Outside of their natural habitat of South America, the snails have no natural enemies. As they reproduce quickly and feed on aquatic plants, which provide food and shelter for native species, they can be devastating to their new environment.\n\"This discovery is one of particular interest because of the invasive nature of the species,\" assistant chief of DNR's Non-game Wildlife and Natural Heritage Section Jon Ambrose told the AP. \"Because of the array of problems that can arise from releasing non-native species into Georgia's waters, we want to stress that this is not a responsible practice for pet owners.\"\nDNR biologists searched the site of the discovery again last weekend. Although no more channeled apple snails were found, they may return for a more elaborate search. The Georgia winter, more severe than Florida\u00b4s, may put a stop to the threat."}

The commission investigated Microsoft's practice of bundling the Windows Media Player software into the Windows operating system in 2003-2004, a practice which rivals complained was destroying the market for their own products. The \"Wall Street Journal\" reported Monday a week ago that the European Commission would decide their course of action in two weeks time.\nNegotiations between Microsoft and the Commission broke down in March 2004 and the company was subsequently fined a record \u20ac497 million (US$ 613 million) for its breaches of EU competition law.\nThe ruling is subject to appeal, but a European Court decided in Dec 2004 that fines imposed on Microsoft by the EU would not be delayed. Microsoft paid the \u20ac497 million fine and must now ship versions of Windows without Windows Media Player. It was also decided by the EU court that Microsoft must license many of the protocols used in its products to developers in countries within the European Economic Area.\nThe European Commission rejected today a proposal by Microsoft to license its workgroup server software protocols. These protocols would allow programmers to build server programs that are compatible with systems and PCs running the Windows operating system. Influencing the decision were complaints from the Free Software Foundation Europe (FSF Europe), which said the per-server licensing proposal violated the principle that the protocols could be used to develop free software, because there is no way of knowing how many servers will be using free software.\n\"Microsoft either doesn't understand or doesn't want to understand the idea of free software,\" said FSF Europe spokesman Joachim Jakobs. \nJakobs explained that as free software is freely distributed, it is impossible to predict the extent of its use. Also, authors of free software would encounter copyright issues with Microsoft when using the protocols to distribute their software. Microsoft stated last Friday that it is still trying to find the balance between the need to preserve the private interests of Microsoft and the public interests.\nEarlier, the European Commission rejected Microsoft's proposal to release the new Windows Media Player-free version of Windows under the name \"Reduced Media Edition.\" Microsoft is now investigating other names suggested by the Commission. It is still unclear whether a deadline is or will be set for the demands by the EU."}

It was generated at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) by smashing beams of gold nuclei together at almost the speed of light. \nThe collision produces a ball of plasma which is about 300 million times hotter that the surface of the Sun. The fireball can be detected because it absorbs jets of particles produced by the collision, but in this case 10 times as many jets were being absorbed as had been predicted by calculations. \nPhysicist Horatiu Nastase of Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island says that the calculations show that the fireball has properties similar to that of a black hole. Nastase says this could help explain why so few jets are seen coming out of the fireball. He thinks the particles are being absorbed into the core and reappearing as thermal (Hawking) radiation, just like theory predicts happens in a black hole. \nOther physicists have pointed out possible holes in Nastase\u2019s calculations.

A victim of severe, and otherwise terminal brain damage, Terri Schiavo's future is locked in a legal battle between her husband who wants to remove life support and her parents, who cite religious reasons for keeping their daughter alive.\nMichael Schiavo, husband of Terri Schiavo, was asked about the Hudson situation on the March 21 edition of CNN's \"Larry King Live.\" When King asked how Mr. Schiavo felt when he learned that President Bush had signed such a law in Texas while he was governor, Schiavo was at a loss of words.\nBut Schiavo's lawyer did respond, saying, \"Obviously, there's a tremendous amount of hypocrisy there ... it would lead one to believe that a lot of this was politically motivated, and I think that's what the American people have concluded.\" Schiavo's lawyer echoed the sentiments of Florida Representative Debbie Wasserman-Schultz, a Democrat, who raised the \"hypocrisy\" question when she first mentioned the 1999 Texas law issue on the House floor last week.\nOver the weekend, President Bush signed a special federal law that moved jurisdiction of the Schiavo case out of the state of Florida and into the U.S. federal court system after Florida courts ruled that Michael Schiavo had the right to remove Terri's life support, which includes a feeding tube and intravenous liquids.\nAfter signing the Schiavo Law Sunday, President Bush said, \"It is wisest to always err on the side of life.\""}

Carol Murray, the marketing director of the Fort Worth Museum of Science and History in Texas, commented that trial customers complained, \"I really hate it when the theory of evolution is presented as fact,\" a view reflected by several others.

Imax presentations are filmed and projected using specialized equipment in specially adapted theatres. Imax films also have tight production and marketing budgets. At any one time, an Imax film may be shown at only two dozen locations.

These types of extrasolar planets orbit closely around their suns, absorbing the starlight and brightly radiating in the infrared wavelengths.\nUsing the Spitzer telescope, the astronomers first collected and measured the total infrared output from both the stars and planets. The stars alone were again measured when the planets disappeared behind them during their natural orbits. By comparing the differences between the two measurements, the scientist were able to determine how much infrared light each planet emits.\n\"In visible light, the glare of the star completely overwhelms the glimmer of light reflected by the planet,\" Charbonneau said. \"In infrared, the star-planet contrast is more favorable because the planet emits its own light.\"\nThe data obtained indicates the planets are at least 1,340 degrees Fahrenheit, justifying the classification of \"hot Jupiter\". More observations from Spitzer could provide information about the planets winds and atmospheric compositions.\n\"Spitzer has provided us with a powerful new tool for learning about the temperatures, atmospheres and orbits of planets hundreds of light-years from Earth,\" said Dr. Deming.\n\"It's fantastic,\" Dr. Charbonneau said. \"We've been hunting for this light for almost 10 years, ever since extrasolar planets were first discovered.\"\nDr. Deming's paper on his findings appears today in Nature's online publication; Dr. Charbonneau's paper will be published in an upcoming issue of the Astrophysical Journal.\nThe Spitzer telescope was launched August 25, 2003 and is scheduled to be de-orbited sometime in 2008. Spitzer was named for Dr. Lyman Spitzer who, in the mid-1940s, first proposed placing telescopes in space.\nThe Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics is located in Cambridge, Massachusetts.\nThe Goddard Space Flight Center is located in Greenbelt, Maryland.\nNASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory manages the Spitzer Space Telescope mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate.

Japanese officials have previously said that in such a case Fischer would be sent to Iceland rather than face punishment for violating US economic sanctions by playing a match in Yugoslavia. The US has said it will oppose any such action.\nThe vote earlier today was 40 in favor, 2 abstentions, 21 absent, and 0 opposed. By a special variation from usual protocol, the measure was pushed through in only 12 minutes. The parliament had earlier declined to grant Fischer full citizenship, offering him instead a special Icelandic passport. This, however, was not enough for Japan, which refused to release him. \nFischer's case has been long and convoluted. Originally pursued by the US for economic sanction violations, Fischer has been on the run since 1992. In that time he has shown his anti-Semitism by having issued statements praising the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks on the United States, and denying that the Holocaust occurred. For these and other comments the United States Chess Federation revoked his membership. He is now also wanted for tax evasion on some property he owns in the US. He was arrested in Japan in July for travelling with a revoked passport, and has been held since then awaiting deportation. In that time he has tried to avoid being deported by doing such things as revoking his US citizenship and marrying a Japanese woman."}

In the community they will be provided income support, Medicare, maternity and child benefits, rent assistance and permission to work, and will be required to periodically report to authorities.\nSenator Amanda Vanstone, Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs said, \"The new Bridging visa will only be granted to a relatively small number of detainees where ... it is not reasonably practicable to achieve removal in the short term and where the detainee undertakes to cooperate fully with removal from Australia, once that becomes practicable.\"\n\"The new bridging visa will not be available to detainees with current visa applications, or who are challenging decisions, either through review or courts,\" the Minister said.\n\"The new bridging visa category does not apply to failed asylum seekers on Nauru. Management of that caseload remains completely separate from onshore cases.\" \nAnd the visa applies only at the Minister's discretion.\nA recent High Court decision has left it in the Government's hands to resolve the issue of indefinite detention, maintaining that under the law there was nothing to prevent immigrants who could not be sent to another country and are not accepted by the Australian Government, from being imprisoned forever.\nThe change is thought to allow release of up to 100 detainees currently held, although it is not a blanket release for all detainees held over three years, for example the longest-serving detainee, Peter Qasim who has been held for seven years, will not be eligible.\nMs Vanstone claims Mr Qasim has not co-operated with the department's attempts to establish his identity. India will only take him if it can be proven that he is Indian - and without any evidence available except his language, he has been unable to return. But according to Ms Vanstone, all it requires is \"further co-operation from Mr Qasim\" - therefore he remains in detention.\nQasim wrote in an open letter in September: \u201cI have asked 80 countries to take me but all have refused. I have committed no crime but I have a life sentence. Please give me freedom. I would work hard with a grateful heart. But I cannot live imprisoned forever without hope.\u201d"}

Kazaa pleaded it could not be held responsible for the copyright infringements perpetrated by its users, as it cannot control how the software is used.\nThe peer-to-peer distribution software and its owner, Sharman Networks Ltd. and its directors were sued by a group of Australian record labels for copyright infringements by the network's estimated 100 million members worldwide. Members of the software share music files with each other, and download up to three billion songs and music files monthly. The music industry claims it has lost millions of dollars in unpaid royalties as a result.\nLawyer Tony Meagher argued that Sharman is no more responsible for the uses of its software than the designers of the photocopiers and video recorders were responsible for the illegal copying of materials on those machines. The remaining question is whether Kazaa authorises its users to download files illegally.\n\"We tell these users in our Web site and we tell them in our license that they cannot use this (software) for infringing copyright,\" Meagher told Judge Murray Wilcox. By consenting to this license by users, Kazaa is exempted from responsibility.\nThe record industry claims Kazaa not only enables but encourages copyright infringement. Record industry lawyer Tony Bannon argued that as Kazaa collected information from its users through spyware and sold it to advertisers, the company's claim that it had no control over the software was \"completely mind boggling.\"\nThis is not the first trial against Kazaa, and other programs of its kind. In August last year, Judge Stephen Wilson ruled that the distribution by Grokster and Morpheus of peer-to-peer software does not violate U.S. copyright law. Rod Dorman, lead trial council for Sharman Networks in the U.S., said, \"As a result of this decision, Sharman Networks will be filing a motion for summary judgement, nearly identical to the successful motions filed by Grokster and Morpheus, and we are confident that Judge Wilson will find that our product, Kazaa, is a lawful product as well.\" However, the ruling held no precedential effect in the Australian trial, as the principles differed.\nKazaa and the FastTrack protocol are the brainchild of the Scandinavians Niklas Zennstr\u00f6m and Janus Friis, and were introduced in March 2001 by their Dutch company Consumer Empowerment.

This year's hunt begins March 29, and lasts for two months.\nThe government reports the harp seal population is large and healthy. \"The harp seal herd - the most important seal herd for this industry - is estimated at around five million animals, nearly the highest level ever recorded, and almost triple what it was in the 1970s,\" a Department of Fisheries and Oceans statement said. Large scale hunts will continue to be allowed until the harp seal population drops below four million.\nEnvironmental activists protest and observe the hunt annually, but this year's larger number of seals has brought a bigger response. Observers are already in the hunt area, and officials said if too many show up they will be prevented from interfering with the hunt. The annual protests, and the publication of photos of the hunt, are a public relations problem for Canada.\nProtests were held in 50 cities around the world last week, and activists say they would press consumers and restaurants to avoid Canadian fish for at least the duration of the hunt.\n\"We're going to be encouraging consumers to enter into dialogue with their grocery stores and their restaurants and say 'Please don't serve Canadian seafood' or 'I won't buy Canadian seafood until this hunt is over',\" said Pat Ragan of the Humane Society of the United States [HSUS] to \"Reuters\".\nThe International Fund for Animal Welfare sponsored two independent veterinary teams to observe the 2001 hunt which concluded the animals are often (42% of the time) killed in an inhumane manner and not in accordance with Canada's own laws."}

She immediately spat it out, warned other patrons to stop eating, and upon recognizing the object as a finger, vomited.\n\"I'm more of a Carl's Jr. person,\" the 39-year-old Las Vegas woman, Anna Ayala, told \"Knight Ridder\". She said this incident was her first visit to a Wendy's restaurant. Ayala described how she found the finger, \"Suddenly something crunchy was in my mouth,\" she continued, \"and I spit it out.\"\nAccording to Devina Cordero, 20, after Ayala found the finger, she ran up to her and Cordero's boyfriend and said, \"Don't eat it! Look, there's a human finger in our chili.\"\n\"We went up to the counter and they told us it was a vegetable,\" Cordero continued. \"The people from Wendy's were poking it with a spoon.\"\nThe restaurant is located at 1405 Monterey Highway, just south of downtown San Jose.\nWikinews reporter drove his car up to the drive-thru menu and found that chili was still on the menu, at a price of US$1.19 for a small serving. He also witnessed workers unloading supplies from a semi-trailer truck in the restaurant's parking lot, and carting them into the back door of the establishment.\nAccording to Ben Gale, director of environmental health for Santa Clara County, the finger did not come from any of the employees at the restaurant. \"We asked everybody to show us they have 10 fingers and everything is OK there,\" he said. The found portion of the finger likely belonged to a woman because of its long and manicured fingernail, also found in the food.\nOfficials seized the food supply at the restaurant and are tracing it back to the manufacturer, where they believe the finger may have gotten mixed in with the raw ingredients used to prepare the chili. The restaurant's operators were later permitted to re-open after preparing new chili prepared from fresh ingredients.\nAs this story was filed, there was no mention of the incident on the Wendy's corporate web site. Wendy's issued a statement through a spokesman.\n\"Food safety is of utmost importance to us,\" said Wendy's spokesman Joe Desmond. He referred to the incident as an \"unsubstantiated claim.\"\n\"We are cooperating fully with the local police and health departments with their investigation. It's important not to jump to conclusions. Here at Wendy's we plan to do right by our customers,\" Desmond said.\nAccording to county health officials, the unfortunate woman who bit into the finger is doing fine, despite her initial reaction. Officials also noted that the finger would have been cooked at a high enough temperature to destroy any viruses.\nThe Santa Clara county medical examiner reported that the finger had a solid fingerprint, although investigators did not say if a search of fingerprint databases would be performed to find the owner of the finger."}

Amal Graafstra, who runs a technology company in Bellingham, WA, asked a doctor to place the chip under the skin of his left hand, and posted pictures of the procedure to the photo-sharing site, Flickr. Graafstra plans to use the chip for keyless entry to his car, home, or as a login for computer systems.\nImplanting RFID chips is a relatively old technology. Professor Kevin Warwick of the University of Reading, UK implanted a 23mm RFID chip into his left arm in August 1998. It allowed him to open doors and turn on the lights in a room as he entered. Further European research in the area was recently dealt a blow when the European Group on Ethics in Science and New Technologies made a presentation to the European Union raising privacy concerns over the potential for such chips to be used to track members of the public.\nIn mid-2004, about 160 Mexican officials received RFID implants for security purposes, and scientists in the past have implanted themselves with such chips for research purposes. In October 2004, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the implantation of Verichip technology for medical purposes.\nAn implantable RFID chip is a minuscule capsule containing a microchip and an antenna, all enclosed in glass. The chip that Mr. Graafstra had implanted was 12mm long and 2mm in diameter \u2014 about the size of a grain of rice. RFID chips work by storing a unique identification number in the microchip. This number can be retrieved by a special RFID reader that is held within close proximity. Graafstra notes that his chip can be read from a distance of about 2 inches (5cm), and only provides the single identifying number.\nDescribing himself as a long-time tinkerer, Graafstra's comments do not show much of a hesitation to perform this process. \"I like to mod things, and I guess it was only natural that it extended to my own body,\" he wrote in an email to Wikinews.\nGraafstra appears to have been impressed by the process, too. \"It was odd feeling it [the chip] being pushed under the surface of my skin... without feeling pain, I was able to really get a feel for just how utilitarian our bodies actually are and how... separate the skin layer really is from the muscle layer under it,\" he told Wikinews. He was able to use his hand to perform technical computer maintenance just an hour after the procedure.\nRFID is a controversial technology. Privacy advocates fear that the technology might be abused by governments and used to track people. Microchip implants have been used for years for tracking lost pets.\nThe pictures that Graafstra posted spurred commentary in the blogosphere, with some assuming that the pictures \u2014 or the process \u2014 were faked. Graafstra denies this, and posted a short video of himself triggering the RFID reader with a swipe of his hand."}

Bishkek was described as sinking into a state of \"anarchy\" by one observer, as gangs of people roamed the streets and plundered stores of consumer goods. Several Bishkek residents blamed protesters from the south for the lawlessness.\n\"There are looters and there are no police to stop them,\" Felix Kulov told \"Reuters\". \"The law enforcement bodies are completely demoralised.\"\nAmid the continued instability, Kazakhstan tightened security along its border with Kyrgyzstan, as Uzbekistan and Tajikistan have recently done."}

The device is Sony's first major attempt at challenging Nintendo's long held grip on the market for handheld games. \nNintendo currently holds a 90 percent of the market share for handhelds in North America. With the recent introduction of Nintendo DS, the fight for control of this market is expected to become even more intense. \nJapanese launch.\nThe first shipment of 200,000 PSP units were made available for purchase in Japan on December 12, 2004. All units sold out within the first two days. Some users reported problems with the launch units, including dead pixels (discolored squares) within the LCD screen and game discs ejecting abruptly if the system is twisted. Sony offered to replace these PSPs under warranty, but said they do not consider a display faulty unless four pixels are within 1cm (0.39 in) of each other. \nGames available for North American Launch.\nSony have said that the following titles will be launched during the \"launch window\":\nTechnical specifications.\nThe unit measures 170 mm (6.7 in) (Length) \u00d7 74 mm (2.9 in) (Width) \u00d7 23 mm (0.9 in) (Depth), and weighs 260 grams (9.17 oz) including the battery. The most noticeable element of the PSP is its 4.3\" 16:9 ratio TFT LCD screen sporting a 480 x 272 pixel resolution capable of 16.77 million colors.\nThe PlayStation Portable's CPU is a MIPS R4000 (32-bit) CPU, split into two cores each operating between 1 and 333 MHz; the system has 32MB of main RAM and 4MB of embedded DRAM. The primary CPU core is responsible for traditional game processor functions; the secondary core, dubbed the \"Virtual Media Engine\", is responsible for decoding multimedia, for example the h.264 decoder. \nThe independent 166 MHz graphics chip provides hardware polygon and NURBS rendering, clipping, morphing, texture compression and tessellation, along with handling image output. Specifications state that the PSP is capable of rendering 33 million flat-shaded polygons per second, with a 664 million pixel per second fill rate.\nUnlike Sony's PlayStation 2 console, the GPU (PS2 Vector Unit equivalent) is not programmable."}

Her injuries, more serious than initially reported, were caused by a projectile that burst her shoulder open and punctured her lungs. She suffers with fluid build-up in her lungs to this day and was unable to leave her home to participate in news interviews. \nSgrena told an independent reporter, Naomi Klein, in a report yesterday (Friday, 3/26/2005) on the \"Pacifica Radio Network\" broadcast called \"Democracy Now with Amy Goodman,\" that they were not on a high security airport road which the Americans had claimed. There were no \"checkpoints\" \u2014 they had already passed through them in the Green Zone. Sgrena stressed this as being very important to this story, and little reported upon in the U.S.\nShe said they received permission from security officials to use a little known, but very secure, road that was near to their airport destination. This road had no roadside bombs \u2014 it is not open to the public and has absolutely no military checkpoints. Access to the road was gained by first passing through the American-held security territory called the \"Green Zone\". Located in the heart of Baghdad, the zone is probably the only partly secure area of the entire country, according to Sgrena. They had their headlights on for easy identification while they traveled, and were in mobile phone contact with Italian security officials.\nMs. Sgrena asks why a tank would fire high velocity munitions at a small vehicle with permission to cross on such a secure road with absolutely no other traffic? What would the motive be to have her killed? It is known that the anti-artillery munitions were 4 inch long armor-plate penetrating rounds, which could explain her severe injury and the death of her body guard.\nHer tragedy and the death of Nicola Calipari have been very detrimental to Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi's public opinion, particularly regarding his participation in the U.S. invasion of Iraq. She had just been released from a horrible sequence of events beginning with her kidnapping and imprisonment in a small room. She did not know \"night from day for an entire month.\" She feared the house she was in might come under fire from American helicopter gunships. She could hear them overhead at all hours of the day and night.\nShe was told by her kidnappers that \"Americans did not want her to get out alive,\" which she dismissed at the time as a threat from the kidnappers. She also said the statement by the kidnappers had an eerie overtone to it, since she knew that Bush didn't want any independent journalists to carry tales out of the killing zones, or to talk to everyday Iraqis. \nAccording to Sgrena, she was placed in the back seat of the escape vehicle with the head of Italy's Foreign Military Intelligence, Nicola Calipari, after her release. He was killed during the attack when he shielded Sgrena from bullets by jumping across her body. The shooting was done by heavy artillery on top of the attacking tank, not a simple machine gun. They fired at Sgrena from behind \u2014 hardly a situation where the car could be a threat to the tank. When the driver, Giulian, climbed out of the shot-up car, he was in touch with his superiors in Italy \u2014 and Ms. Sgrena says he was telling them they had been taking intense gunfire, \"300 to 400 shots.\" The Americans aimed guns at him and told him to hang up immediately.\nKlein, the reporter with this story, stated the American press has not reported any of this. Nor have they given the American people any idea of the seriousness of the injuries to Sgrena. Sgrena also questioned why the US Army was not aware of her release from kidnapping, as all of the major news wires had reported it prior to the shooting incident.\nLate Thursday, Italian Justice minister, Roberto Castelli, contacted American officials for permission allowing Italian police access to the escape car, a Toyota Corolla which was rented from the Baghdad airport. Americans have previously only permitted Italian authorities access to photographs of the car, and have not stated when they will allow the Italians to have access to the vehicle.\nRecently Mr. Berlusconi has begun to backpedal on his statement that Italian troops would be out of the war zone by September. He now claims he never said that, and Italians won't leave Iraq until it can police itself."}

Sarah S. Froman, an alumni of Harvard Law School and a practicing lawyer, implied that allowing teachers to carry weapons is one of the many options that should be examined.\nGuns and other weapons are commonly banned on school campuses in the United States, but the high-profile incidents of students defying the bans and bringing firearms to classes could place the school at a disadvantage if the student were to fire the weapon. In the case of the recent student shooting at a Native American reservation in Minnessota the school had metal detectors and had an on-duty security guard. The guard was unarmed, however, and was gunned down by the student.\nFroman told the AP that if it is the responsibility of teachers to protect students from harm, then the society must find a way to let teachers do that. She also said that gun control laws or bans cannot prevent a malicious individual from acting out, and provided an example of a 1997 shooting incident where an armed teacher was able to help police apprehend the student.\nFroman is currently the NRA's first vice president, and is expected to be elected to the post of president in the organization's elections next month.

The tool offers a variety of views of document histories, including a view that gives each revision equal importance, and a timeline view which displays each revision proportionally to how long it remained current. Each different editor who makes changes to the article has a distinct color, allowing for that editor's text to be tracked over time. \nThe tool was first developed in 2003 by a collaboration between Fernanda B. Vi\u00e9gas of the MIT Media Lab and Martin Wattenberg and Kushal Dave of IBM. It was initially tested out on a large subset of the pages of Wikipedia, a free online encyclopedia project which preserves every change made to each of its articles. The resulting paper was drafted in the winter of 2003 and presented at a conference in April 2004; it remains the most comprehensive overview of the lifecycle of articles in an active wiki community. A year later, the history flow paper is still the most frequently cited source of statistics about the reversion of vandalism on Wikipedia.\nThe current tool is maintained by Martin Wattenberg and Jonathan Feinberg at IBM. It allows users to download the text and histories of the contents of any MoinMoin wiki, or to view the history of the contents of an entire directory of documents.

Protesters report that a fourth person appears to be missing.\nAn estimated 400 protesters have been camping around four kilometres from the centre over the Easter weekend, to highlight the Australian Government's policy of mandatory detention. Police have been using helicopters to watch the protesters as they have marched from their campsite to the centre.\nMore than 200 police charged at protesters as they marched toward the centre. The protesters had formed a tight group and were slowly marching towards the centre. One protester received a minor arm injury during the clash.\n\"I think it was quite over the top,\" said protester Mark Goudkamp. \"I mean it was pretty clear [by] the way that we were marching in very slowly, very packed as a united group that we didn't pose any threat to the security of the centre on the inside.\"\n\"Everyone was banded together and people at the front knocked down the fences and we moved forces past the barrier and down to the detention centre,\u201d said Kate, a protester from Brisbane.\n\u201cWe pushed forward and got quite a fair way into the space.

The first commissioning phase was begun soon after launch and was designed to test and calibrate the instruments on board the two-part spacecraft. All instruments have checked out except for the High Resolution Instrument (HRI).\nMission controllers performed a \"bake-out\" or heating of the HRI to remove moisture that accumulated during the craft's final hours on the launch pad and its travel through the atmosphere. Test images taken after the procedure indicate the device has not reached perfect focus. A special team has been assigned to investigate and bring the instrument into full focus.\n\"This in no way will affect our ability to impact the comet on July 4,\" said Rick Grammier, Deep Impact project manager at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. \"Everyone on the science and engineering teams is getting very excited and looking forward to the encounter.\"\nDeep Impact has four data collectors to observe the effects of the cometary collision: the High Resolution Instrument consisting of a camera and infrared spectrometer; the Medium Resolution Instrument; and a duplicate camera on the Impactor Targeting Sensor. They will record the vehicle's final moments before it slams into comet Tempel 1 at a relative velocity of 37,000 kilometers per hour (23,000 miles per hour). The Medium Resolution Instrument and Impactor Targeting Sensor are performing as expected.\nDr. Michael A'Hearn of the University of Maryland added, \"We are very early in the process of examining the data from all the instruments. It appears our infrared spectrometer is performing spectacularly, and even if the spatial resolution of the High Resolution Instrument remains at present levels, we still expect to obtain the best, most detailed pictures of a comet ever taken.\"\nDeep Impact is a two part vehicle: the flyby spacecraft and a smaller impactor. 24 hours prior to impact, the flyby craft will aim tracking telescopes at the comet and release the impactor.\nThe impactor is a battery-powered spacecraft that operates independently of the flyby spacecraft for just one day. It is called a \u201csmart\u201d impactor because, after its release, it takes over its own navigation and maneuvers into the path of the comet. The crater produced by the impactor is expected to range from the width of a house up to the size of a football stadium and be from two to 14 stories deep. Ice and dust debris will be ejected from the crater revealing the material beneath.\nNASA's Hubble, Spitzer and Chandra space telescopes, along with the largest telescopes on Earth, will observe the effects of the material flying from the comet's newly formed crater along with the imagers aboard Deep Impact.\nDeep Impact was launched on January 12, 2005 on board a Delta 2 rocket."}

The wave at sea had not yet broken, and so posed no threat to vessels far enough from shore.\nIn Sri Lanka in Batticoloa District, the tsunami hit at the hour women on the east coast usually took their baths in the sea.\nWomen looking after children at the time of the tidal wave were further distracted by trying to save their children, while men away from the house were able to dedicate more of their efforts to saving themselves.\nAnother factor particularly important in Aceh was that many of the men of the region had left to seek work elsewhere, while women stayed behind in their home community, which was almost completely wiped out by the wave.\nThe survey looked at Aceh Besar district of Indonesia, the North Aceh district, the two worst-affected districts of Tamil Naidu in South India, being Nagapattinam and Cuddalore, and used rough statistics and anecdotal information from Sri Lanka, where hard figures are not available."}

It also guarantees protection for the area within the city's Second Ring Road.\nDirector of the Beijing Administrative Bureau of Cultural Heritage, Mei Ninghua, said \"the most encouraging content of the regulations is that Beijing will pay more attention to protecting the old city's landscape in its entirety, rather than just focussing on scattered heritage sites.\" This means the old city layout, colours of buildings, and the names of houses and lanes will have legal protection.\n\"We took measures to protect the city's siheyuan courtyard houses by tagging protection plates on more than 650 of them in 2003, preventing them from being demolished or damaged during the city's massive housing reconstruction projects,\" said Mei.\n\"Now the new regulations give legal buttress to the protection of siheyuan courtyard homes, as well as other unmovable ancient treasures, that have yet to be listed but are at risk of being demolished during urban renovation.\"\nModern Beijing, capital of China for 850 years, was built by Mongul Emporer Kublai Khan in 1267 AD. In the vicinity of the current city once was Ji (\u84df), the capital of the State of Yan (\u71d5), a power of the Warring States Period - but it has been lost in the mists of time."}

The Central Election Commission of Kyrgyzstan voted to endorse the legitimacy of the newly elected and protested parliament on Saturday. \nBoth a pre-election chamber, comprising of an upper and lower house, and a post-election chamber, comprising of single house, met in separate rooms of the parliament building on Saturday. MPs from both parliaments are set to meet and debate how to proceed. Among solutions proposed are keeping both parliaments functioning until the next election.\n\"Our opinion is that we should be the legitimate lawmakers because the people have chosen us,\" said Roman Shin, who was elected to the new parliament. He said the MPs of the former parliament, which were meeting once again, \"don't want to abandon power.\" \n\"The revolution was made by [only] 5,000 people,\" he said, and added that he and his allies could organize at least five times as many.\n\"It all happen so fast, we don't even know if we can call it a revolution,\" Felix Kulov, newly appointed head of security ministries, told . \"We still haven't figured out what happened. People just ran into the White House and the president fled the country. It was not planned. It was not a revolution. But now we have to take control somehow.\"\nProtesters meet with Bakiyev.\nHundreds of protesters rushed into the Kyrgyz parliament demanding a meeting with acting President on Saturday, according to a RIA Novosti correspondent. \nThey demanded that the newly elected parliament be declared illegitimate. Bakiyev promised that he'd settle the matter within two weeks, and the protesters were reportedly not satisfied by his assurances.\nEight of ten members of the Central Election Commission of Kyrgyzstan voted to acknowledge the protested results of the last election as legitimate. Earlier this week, the Supreme Court declared the election results annulled.\n\"The decision of the Supreme Court is illegal as it was made under pressure of the crowd. After the announcement of the registration results the Central Election Commission can hold a session, for instance, tomorrow,\" a newly elected MP, Alisher Sabirov, told RIA Novosti. \nOn Saturday the upper house of the former parliament said it would preserve its authorities before the June 26 presidential elections and did not acknowledge the new parliament.\nLeaders of key political structures signed a compromise memorandum on the March 25. The memorandum states that the former parliament will continue to serve until April 14. After that, the new parliament will take over.\nHowever, quite a few MPs are doubting the legitimacy of the March 25 memorandum. They are demanding that the former, two-house parliament's tenure be extended. The more radical MPs are demanding that the new parliament, or \"imposters,\" must leave the parliament building. They contend that the memorandum must be revised.\nThe lower house of parliament is also rumored to be discussing the possibility of declaring a state of emergency, behind closed doors.\nBakiyev appoints new ministers.\n, who was elected both acting president and prime minister, also appointed new ministers on Friday. Among the newly-appointed ministers are Myktybek Abdyldayev, former chief prosecutor who had been fired by deposed president on Wednesday, as interior minister, Felix Kulov as minister of security, and Rosa Otunbayeva as minister of foreign affairs.\nThe ministers were appointed as acting ministers and thus did not need the approval of the upper house of parliament.\nThe former parliament also scheduled Kyrgyz presidential elections for June 26. This announcement was met by MPs with applause. \n\"I think I should run in the presidential elections. God willing, I will,\" Bakiyev said.\nAdding to the uncertainty, deposed president Askar Akayev has said that he has not resigned and intends to return to the country. However, Bakiyev and Kulov both said that there were no grounds for impeaching or persecuting Akayev.\n\"The vote of no confidence takes place in case of high treason or after initiation of criminal proceedings. So far, we have no evidence of either,\" Kulov said in an interview on national television.\n\"I have no intention of persecuting Askar Akayev. He has done much for democracy and building a sovereign Kyrgyzstan,\" Bakiyev told reporters.\nBakiyev reportedly met with the ambassador to Kyrgyzstan and discussed the situation with Russian President over the telephone. Putin reportedly offered the county Russia's help.\nBakiyev appealed to the staff of deposed President Akayev and Prime Minister Tanayev's offices to report back to work. \"We must re-establish order in the White House,\" Bakiyev said."}

It would add greenhouse gas emissions to the list of controlled substances, allowing the Canadian government to regulate those emissions, he contends. \"This is an attempt by the government to get unlimited power to impose multimillion-dollar fines on any basis, without any parliamentary approval or discussion, whatsoever.\" Harper said.\nThe controversial amendment was introduced after a lengthy cabinet debate between Finance Minister Ralph Goodale and others.\nWhen the budget was tabled last month, Harper initially said his party would support the bill. He now says the party will oppose it unless the Liberal government removes the amendment. Environment Minister St\u00e9phane Dion, who is attempting to have a $10 million Kyoto implementation plan in place by April 4, said he would be \"very, very pleased\" to fight an election over climate change.\nThe NDP and Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois have both said they will oppose the bill.

We don't know the plan, we didn't discuss the plan,\" Duceppe said. \u201cI'm ready to have an election any time if this is what they want.\"\nNDP leader, Jack Layton, said \"The Liberals are playing games with the environment. Paul Martin doesn't care about the Kyoto plan.

The discovery was made at the La Silla Observatory in Chile.\nHidden behind a veil of dust and gas, the super star cluster, known as Westerlund 1, is\n1000 times closer than any other known clusters. These Super star clusters were previously known to exist as pairs or groups of interacting galaxies located at immense intergalactic distances. It is so close--within 10,000 light years--scientists will be able to examine its structure in detail. Until now, super clusters were far too distant for individual\nstars to be distinguished.\nInitial observations have led scientists to conclude the group contains at least 100,000 times the mass of the Sun, with some single stars shining with a power of 1,000,000 suns and 2000 times larger than our own. All the stars are in a region less than six light years across.\nThe existence of Westerlund 1's has been known since 1961. Discovered by Swedish astronomer Bengt Westerlund while in Australia, the cluster is located in the Southern constellation Ara (the Altar). It was a dimming factor of more than 100,000 caused by the gas and dust between us and the cluster that prevented the actual structure and nature of the phenomenon to be determined.\nUsing a variety of instruments, including the Wide Field Imager (WFI)\nattached to a 2.2 meter scope and the Superb-Seeing Imager 2 (SuSI2) camera\non the ESO 3.5 meter New Technology Telescope\n(NTT), 200 cluster member stars were identified. These and other\nobservations have revealed the cluster contains young stars on the\norder of 30-40 times more massive than our own Sun. The age range has been\ndetermined at 3.5 to five million years old, making this cluster very young\ncompared to the Galaxy itself at around 13.5 billion years.\nThe research will appear in the leading research journal \"Astronomy and Astrophysics\", and is titled \"On the massive stellar population of the Super Star Cluster\nWesterlund 1\", by J.S. Clark and colleagues. A second paper, \"Further\nWolf-Rayet stars in the starburst cluster Westerlund 1\", by Ignacio\nNegueruela and Simon Clark will also be published in the same journal."}

The statement came after a joint meeting in Beirut with UN ambassadors from Britain, China and Russia. Further meetings with UN envoys from France and the United States are being sought.\nOpposition government pressure, spearheaded by Druze chieftain Walid Jumblatt, called for the removal of all Lebanese security chiefs earlier that day. Urging for their resignations, Jumblatt said, \u201cIt is not possible to carry out a just, serious, clear and transparent investigation if the heads of the agencies remain in their place.\u201d\nLebanon\u2019s pro-Syrian government originally rejected a UN Security Council report issued Thursday that found, \"[security services] has neither the capacity nor the commitment to reach a satisfactory and credible conclusion\" in the bombing assassination of the anti-Syrian former prime minster Rafiq Hariri. The UN investigation complained they could not conduct it more thoroughly, partly due to lack of cooperation from Lebanon\u2019s security services. The UN report bolsters Jumblatt claims these services are staffed by pro-Syrian agents and are the source of the car bombings and other lawlessness.\nThe Hariri assassination on Feb 14 was the galvanizing force that spurred opposition government groups to street protests and rallies. The capital has since been beset with protesting groups both for, and against, the Syrian presence in Lebanon. A recent rally was estimated to have numbered a million people.\nIn the face of these events and UN pressure, the Syrian capital of Damascus agreed to have its forces leave Lebanon. The Syrians have completed the first phase of its previously announced two-stage withdrawal. A meeting is planned for early April where a Lebanese-Syrian military committee will discuss the how the second stage will be conducted. The goal is for complete withdrawal before national elections scheduled for May.\nThe worry is that Lebanon may be so far diminished in the vacuum created by the Syrian exit, the country may plunge into chaos.

If deported to the U.S., the felony charge he faces could carry a maximum 10 year sentence.\nThe U.S. charges Fischer with violating government sanctions 13 years ago against Yugoslavia. He traveled to Serbia, then part of Yugoslavia, for a 1992 rematch against Boris Spassky, a Russian chess king, who Fischer defeated in 1972 to become world champion in a famous showdown in Reykjavik, Iceland.\nDuring his flight to a stop-over in Copenhagen while en route to Iceland, Fischer conducted an interview with \"AP Television News\" on board. \"Bush does not respect law,\" he told the \"AP\". \"It's like in the comics, like Billy Batson used to say 'Shazam!' and he becomes Captain Marvel. He (Bush) just says 'Enemy Combatant! Now you have no legal rights.' It's a farce,\" he said. \"This is absolutely cooked up between Bush and Koizumi.\"\nVery opinionated, but normally less outspoken, Fischer\u2019s verbal attacks express outrage over the treatment he is receiving."}

The law, aiming specifically at child molestation and domestic violence cases, is unlike other cases where the prior criminal conduct of the defendant is not permissable in court.\nThe ruling will allow testimony in cases arising from over 10 years ago.

Grokster\" legal battle were heard before the Supreme Court of the United States March 29. In the case, 28 entertainment companies have joined together to sue , maker of Morpheus software, and Grokster.\nA final ruling is expected on the case within a few months. The issue heard before the court was an appeal of prior decisions made since 2001 at the U.S. district court level and from the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. Both of those decisions were in favor of Grokster's right to market its P2P software.\nP2P stands for peer-to-peer software, which uses the Internet as a medium for millions of users to distribute digital content, such as music, movies, books, and software, among themselves. By far the majority of the content distributed through this method is without the permission of the copyright holder.\nMorpheus is one of the most-popular peer-to-peer software products worldwide. StreamCast also operates MusicCity.com. Lawyers from the EFF Foundation (www.eff.org) are serving as defense counsel in the case.\nThe result of this case could determine the ultimate fate of P2P software in the U.S., whether it is legal for software companies to produce and sell software that, in the opinion of some, facilitates profit illegally from the trade in copyrighted materials. However, even if illegal in America, such software might still be widely available from international hosts due to technological limitations of enforcing such a ruling. The companies behind this effort are aiming to hold technological innovators legally responsible for infringing uses of their technology.\n\"About 36 million Americans \u2014 or 27 percent of internet users\u2014say they download either music or video files and about half of them have found ways outside of traditional peer-to-peer networks or paid online services to swap their files\". As a measure of public opinion on the issue, they stated, \"49% of all Americans and 53% of internet users believe that the firms that own and operate file-sharing networks should be deemed responsible for the pirating of music and movie files,\" according to Pew Internet &amp; American Life Project in their most recent survey,\nThe landmark ' decision of 1984 (') is the most relevant U.S. in this matter (note: the precedent Betamax case supports the legality of P2P netowrks). A decision in the case could either affirm \"Betamax\", or overturn it. This is the case that essentially created the VCR market in America for distributing movies at home, and so in this modern technologically updated version, there are billions of dollars in future revenues now at stake."}

But that doesn't mean it won't buttress the negative image of the United States held by its critics around the world.\"\nThis ongoing dispute does not capture the entire relationship of US and China on civil rights. Even as both sides trade accusations, the US on March 18, 2005, declined to table a resolution at the UN criticizing China, citing the ongoing improvements that are being made in that country. This is the second time in three years that the US has not submitted such a resolution, which in fact has never passed the UN when it was submitted before."}

The investigation was led by former US Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker, who said that the investigation initiated by Kofi Annan should instead have been referred to UN's independent watchdog agency.

The journalists went missing Monday, and have been identified as reporter Marie Jeanne Ion, cameraman Sorin Dumitru Miscoci and reporter Ovidiu Ohanesian. Miscoci and Ion were both from the television station Prima TV, which had been in Baghdad for five days to conduct interviews with Prime Minister Iyad Allawi and interim President Ghazi al-Yawer. Ohanesian was an investigative reporter from the Bucharest-based 'Rom\u00e2nia liber\u0103' newspaper, and was scheduled to return to Romania this weekend.\nThe three journalists were abducted from a street next to the Flowerland Hotel, in the upscale Jadriya neighborhood, where they were staying. A hotel employee stated that the abduction occurred at approximately 20:30 on Monday. Prima TV also confirmed that it lost contact with the crew at 19:45 on Monday, and that Ion and Miscoci were probably kidnapped by a rebel group from Baghdad's al-Mansur district.\nKidnapping confirmed.\nThe kidnapping was confirmed as Marie Jeanne Ion made a phone call to the Prima TV newsroom shortly after she was abducted, speaking a mixture of Romanian, English and Arabic. She told her colleagues to call the Romanian Embassy in Baghdad for help. Voices of men, seemingly angry and shouting in Arabic, could be heard in the background. A few minutes later, Ion sent an SMS message from her mobile phone to Prima TV, saying \"Help, this is not a joke, we've been kidnapped. Help!\"\nDan Dumitru, the news director at Prima TV, told another television station, Realitatea TV, \"All I know [is that] they have been taken by force and we can't reach them any more.\" Ohanesian, the reporter from 'Rom\u00e2nia liber\u0103', could not be contacted, even though his colleagues in Bucharest tried ringing his mobile phone, which was switched off.\nRomanian authorities promise action.\nPresident Traian B\u0103sescu, who has just returned from a surprise visit to Iraq, said on Monday night that \"All the state structures are on alert and determined to resolve the disappearance of the three journalists.\" He also said that Romania has sought the help of the US-led coalition authorities in Iraq.\nRomanian Prime Minister C\u0103lin Popescu-T\u0103riceanu confirmed the kidnapping on Tuesday morning, while on Monday evening he claimed that it was unclear what had happened to the three abducted journalists, and that no-one had contacted the Romanian government or authorities demanding a ransom. He went on to say that the journalists went missing in an upscale district that is only known for low-level crime, and that there is consequently a \"ray of hope\" that their abduction is not serious. However, T\u0103riceanu said that a special crisis unit was created inside the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to solve the abduction problem. The unit will make use of all necessary state institutions, including Romanian and foreign intelligence agencies.\nAbduction could soften Romania's stance on Iraq.\nRomania currently has one of the world's largest contingents in Iraq, with more than 800 troops. During his visit to Baghdad on the weekend, President B\u0103sescu said that he does not want to reduce the troop contingent and that Romania \"will continue to take part in the reconstruction and stabilization missions in Iraq.\" Romania also announced that it will be sending 100 troops for peacekeeping purposes soon. This news comes in a time when most other countries in Europe have considered recalling their troops.\nUntil now, the Romanian presence in Iraq has not been as controversial as in other countries, mainly because no Romanian troops have died in Iraq. However, the abduction of the three journalists, announced on Monday, is expected to result in a decline of public support for the war, especially since 55% of Romanians are opposed to Romania's contribution to the war, after an opinion poll conducted in Bucharest on Monday. This is expect to result in authorities in reducing their plans for a stronger Romanian military presence in Iraq.\nRomanian political analyst Stelian T\u0103nase said, \"It will be a shock for the public. It is the first time something like this has happened. If Romanian authorities aren't able to free the journalists, it will harm the support that B\u0103sescu enjoys.\"\nFrench government send their sympathies.\nThe French authorities were the first government to sent their sympathies to the Romanian people in regards to the abduction of the three journalists. The spokesperson of the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Michel Barnier, said \"Romania can be sure of France's understanding.\" In response to whether Romania and France will collaborate on this case, M. Barnier said, \"We will see if there is a request from the Romanian authorities.\" French journalists have also fallen victim to Iraqi rebels. Florence Aubenas, a French journalist, and her Iraqi guide were kidnapped in January 5 of this year, and have not yet been found."}

After the unexpected popularity of last Saturday's return of the series to BBC airwaves, the star of the show is calling it quits from fears of typecasting.\nAccording to a report from the BBC, actor Christopher Eccleston, who injected a edgier and sexier image onto the title character plans to leave the series once his 13-episode commitment is over later this year. Eccleston told reporters that his last appearance as The Doctor will be for a December Christmas special.\nThe show, which debuted March 26 after a 16-year hiatus, was the highest-rated television show in the UK that night. With an estimated viewership of about 10.5 million at its peak, more than 44 percent of all television households in the country tuned in to see the new Doctor. \"The audience's response for the new Doctor Who has been incredible and I am really proud to be part of it and I hope viewers continue to enjoy the series,\" Eccleston said in a BBC release. \nBut that popularity was a double-edged sword for Eccleston. With roughly half the population seeing him as Doctor Who, he feared that once typecast as a science fiction Time Lord, audiences may not accept him in other roles. At one year, Eccleston will be the shortest-lived Doctor after Paul McGann who starred in the 1996 telemovie.\nBut the television network airing the show wants more of the crowd pleaser.

Tennant is a star of the BBC period drama, \"Casanova\".\nIn the announcement of the renewal of \"Doctor Who\", the BBC did say it re-signed series co-star Billie Piper, who agreed to reprise the role of the Doctor's sidekick for series two.

Media, Technology and the Common Good\" at its Nieman Foundation for Journalism. Held March 3-4 and providing a certain amount of video to be rebroadcast through the web, the event was widely commented on by both bloggers and traditional media.\nAmong the participants was Richard Sambrook, Director of the BBC World Service and Global News Division, which has taken on the challenge of incorporating the voices of citizen journalists into their news gathering and presentation process. At what he calls the \"community level\", the BBC is engaging a project called \"Digital Storytelling\" in which they are assisting and working with individuals in the recording and production of videos that \"document their lives and report and cull things of importance to them\", which the BBC has then distributed by a variety of means. They are also encouraging participation in issues of citizen concern at the national and international levels.\nSome participants such as co-creator of the seminar, Matt Thompson expressed concern over the growing centralization of the ownership of mainstream news media in the hands of a few corporate sponsors, at the same time it incorporates these growing sources of audience information. \"I think that people are looking forward to a media that can truly respond to them, even if the...corporate centralization aspects of it in this giant 'Googlezon' entity give many people pause\" quoting a MetaFilter.com thread to the effect, \"I for one welcome our new Googlezon overlords.\"\nThere was some discussion of the traditional media and its engagement with recent issues of national importance. \"I think there's been a massive media failure across the board...there's been an institutional failure.\", said MediaChannel Executive Editor Danny Schechter in discussing his film, \"WMD: Weapons of Mass Distortion\". He suggested two basic fixes including \"more diversity of perspective...let's have a real debate and discussion\" and \"don't take everything at face value and check facts and look at perspectives from other countries.\" He decried what he called \"groupthink\" in American media and called for \"more feisty independent journalists, and more watchdog, less lapdog.\"\nHowever, some other critics have elsewhere expressed concerns about the actual independence and diversity of webloggers and other non-traditional media as an antidote to perceived media bias. For example, there is often a perceived lack of race or sex diversity among top bloggers. Steven Levy, a senior editor of Newsweek, has recently written a column addressing concerns about the over-representation of white males among top bloggers on the Internet. Technorati.com, a website which describes itself as \"the authority on what is happening on the real-time web\", maintains a list of the top 100 blogs that was used as the basis for his column. However, others such as Heather Mac Donald at National Review have pointed out that there are no actual barriers to participation to anyone who wishes to engage in blogging, and so such imbalances in representation are probably not the result of personal bias."}

In 2001, the tube was removed, but was reinserted two days later after an appeal by Terri's parents, Bob and Mary Schindler. After the Schindler family had all of their appeals rejected, the tube was removed once again in 2003, but reinserted six days later when Governor and the Florida legislature collaborated on a bill, allowing Bush to order the tube reinserted. After the law was overturned in May of 2004, and the Schindler family's numerous appeals were again rejected, the tube was removed on March 18th.\nPresident George W. Bush held a press conference, in part to offer his condolences to the friends and family of Schiavo. The president commended those on both sides of the issue.\nAn autopsy is planned to be performed in the coming days, which both the Schindler family and Michael Schiavo hope will shed some light on the cause of her brain damage.\nSchiavo is survived by her husband, parents and her younger siblings Robert Jr. and Suzanne; she had no children. Schiavo was 41 years old."}

Permission for the sanctions was granted by the World Trade Organization (WTO) due to the U.S. maintaining a law known as the Byrd Amendment, which gives its companies billions of dollars collected from foreign rivals.\nU.S. Congress failed to repeal the four-year-old Byrd Amendment ruled illegal by the WTO in September 2002. The WTO gave the EU and Canada, in addition to Brazil, Japan, India, South Korea and Mexico the right to impose retaliatory tariffs on November 27. The tariffs will take effect May 1.\nThe retaliatory tariffs will largely affect U.S. paper, clothing and machinery for the EU and live swine, cigarettes and oysters for Canada.\nIn the 2004 fiscal year, U.S. based Timken received $40 million, and Lancaster Colony Corp. received about $26 million. The EU says that total payouts will rise as high as $1.6 billion in the fiscal year of 2005 unless the law is repealed. The U.S. Congressional Budget Office estimated that payouts for the fiscal year of 2006 will reach $1.15 billion.\nThe European tariffs will collect near $26 million, while the Canadian tariffs will amount to near $11.6 million.\nThe European Commission, in a statement, said the tariffs were caused by \"the continuing failure of the U.S. to bring its legislation into conformity with its international obligations.\"\nAccording to Canadian Trade Minister Jim Peterson, the tariffs are \"a strong message that we are all sending to the U.S. that international rule, those of the WTO, must be respected.

The ruling lowers the legal bar, over which an employee who felt wronged by an employer must pass, by allowing cases to move forward when explicit evidence is lacking.\nThe court ruled on the case of police officers in Jackson, Miss. In their 5-3 decision, they found for a group of officers to proceed with damages claiming they were harmed by their department\u2019s salary policy. The findings of the court do not mean the group of officers will necessarily win their lawsuit. Rather, the judges thought their particular case was flimsy, but they ruled the officer\u2019s complaints were on valid grounds to pursue the claim. Therefore, the suit will not be thrown out of Mississippi\u2019s state court as being groundless.\nBusiness interests closely watching the case and fearing worse were reassured by the court stopping far short of supporting the officers\u2019 claims. The Jackson city salary plan was changed to increase the pay of junior level officers by 30% to be competitive with surrounding municipalities and attract recruits.\nThe more senior level police officers\u2019 age discrimination allegations will probably not be enough to win the suit, but the effect of the new law means employers will need to defend their practices, and cannot summarily get lawsuits dismissed on the basis of allegations being groundless. Legal scholars believe this has importance because it acknowledges some forms of age discrimination in the work place are subtle. With half of US workers in the workforce now over 40, employers will need to be attentive to their practices or find them challenged in court.\nThe language of the ruling broadens the nation\u2019s existing law found in the Age Discrimination in Employment Act passed in 1967. While lawyers do not expect a great increase in age-bias cases due to the ruling, it does make the path to mounting a case easier. It is notable that corporate policies that do adversely discriminate against older workers are still considered legal if they are formed on reasonable grounds other than age. The law\u2019s effect will not necessarily have employers change their policies, but rather re-think their practices to assure they are fair."}

The project is described as the \"nation's largest neighborhood watch group\" by Minuteman field operations director Chris Simcox. \nThe goal of the project is to make Americans aware of porous and undefended American borders. Motivated by a concern for illegal drug trafficking, the availability of entry points for potential terrorists, and a lack of effective enforcement of immigration laws by US federal and state officials, the name Minuteman was used in order for the group to portray itself as a \"grassroots effort to bring Americans to the defense of their homeland, similar to the way the original Minutemen from Massachusetts (and other U.S. colonies) did in the late 1700s,\" according to the group's website.\nThe activities of the Minutemen are protected by legal rights found in the US Constitution, according to various commentators. Says Arizona Gov. Janet Napolitano, \"People are entitled to exercise their First Amendment rights and entitled to assemble...That's why you can't stop the Minutemen from coming even though, from a law enforcement perspective, it's worrisome to have untrained people, potentially armed, performing what should be a law enforcement function.\" Some of the Minutemen plan to be armed in order to defend themselves in case of aggressive action by potential armed illegal immigrants and those who transport them. The carrying of handguns is allowed under Arizona law and is protected by the Second Amendment.\nThe Minutemen are not allowed by law to arrest or detain potential illegal immigrants, and any such action is forbidden by the group's organizers. The project's goal is to survey the area using planes and binoculars, and to alert the appropriate authorities and follow suspected illegal immigrants until they are detained. Observers from various groups, most prominently the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), plan to be on hand to monitor the activities of the Minutemen with a view to mounting possible legal challenges against them. \nCritics, such as some Arizona state Hispanic lawmakers, are planning to show up at the public gatherings and press conferences of the Minutemen, in order to raise criticism and present contrary points of view in the public eye about what they believe to be the current state of illegal immigration. Some opponents have also complained that many participants may be motivated by racism or vigilantism; however, the organizers of the Project make a point of emphasizing their lack of participation with separatist or supremacist groups and the racial diversity and inclusiveness of their volunteers.\nIllegal immigrants and their public benefits have come under increasing scrutiny in recent months in Arizona, with the passing of Proposition 200 on November 2, 2004 by a margin of 56% of voters in favor. This proposition attempts to prevent illegal immigrants from voting or receiving some government services. The effort to define what benefits they can legally be excluded from is ongoing, for example with the recent failure of HB2264 to pass an Arizona senate committee; the bill would have required some illegal immigrants to pay higher out-of-state rates for college tuition.\nSimilar efforts to the current Minuteman Project have been organized in the past few years, but with few participants and without notable success. Some local residents were concerned that possible violence could erupt from the presence of additional armed individuals, either among the Minutemen or the illegal immigrants. Others welcomed the presence of the Minutemen, considering them tourists helping the local economy, and appreciating their drawing attention to the perceived lax enforcement of border control by Federal authorities. Their activities are planned to last for about a month."}

The bill was passed by the Maine House of Representatives by a vote of 91-58 Wednesday. The State Senate approved the bill the same day by a vote of 25-10.\nAlready protected classes under the state's human rights act are gender, age, religion, race, and physical and mental disability. Additional language was added to LD 1196 before it passed clarifying that it would not extend marriage rights to same-sex couples and exempts privately-funded religious groups from having to comply with its provisions. The new law takes effect June 30.\nGovernment official said the new law is needed to send a message. The office of the Maine Attorney General says that the number of hate crimes against gays and lesbians increased by 12 percent in 2003. Baldacci said those figures underscore why the new law is needed.\n\"This act not only offers essential civil rights, but serves as a welcome,\" Baldacci said in a press conference after signing the new law. \"Our doors are open to all people. This is a proud day for Maine.\"\nBut at least one group is organizing to stop the new gay rights law in its tracks. According to reports, the Christian Civic League of Maine has filed initial paperwork to put a voter initiative on the November 2005 general election ballot to overturn the new law.\nThe group must get at least 50,519 valid signatures from registered voters of the state by a June 28 deadline. Michael Heath, executive director of the group, told the Associated Press that the League has a goal of 70 thousand valid signatures and hopes to raise $2 million to fund a campaign, called a \"people's Veto,\" to repeal the new law."}

The leader urged, \"Zimbabweans must defend their right to vote and they must defend their vote.\"\nPast MDC street protests were met violently by Mugabe's regime, and the court system in Zimbabwe is seen as largely supportive of the Zanu-PF agenda.\nThe Zanu-PF took 55 of the 120 seats in the Zimbabwe Parliament. The MDC took 34 seats. The MDC had received strong support during pre-election rallies and had hoped to gain enough new seats to gain a legislative majority in the parliament. Mugabe, now 81, will appoint another 30 seats, which will ensure his party a majority.\nTsvangirai cites the area of Manyame located near the capital as an example of election rigging.

Under the brand name, U-verse, the SBC's television rollout is set to launch in 2006 after field trials begin later this year.\nThe company is seeking the so-called \"triple play,\" where a telecommunications company offers voice, data and video in one bundled package. Local telephone companies like SBC have been losing business to cable TV companies, which have added telephone and Internet services in recent years.\nIn a slew of recent deals, SBC is looking to stop that trend. Within the past six months it has signed alliances with various technology firms to build out a fiber network to the home strategy. For instance, SBC has a $1.7 billion deal with Alcatel to build out its fiber optic network and a 10-year, $400 million, pact with Microsoft to license its IPTV technology to allow multi-channel television to stream over its Internet backbone.\nIn most of the U.S. only cable TV companies like Comcast have been able to offer the \"triple play\" of voice, video and data services. But traditional phone companies like SBC and Verizon have been upgrading their copper wire telephone networks to fiber optic. SBC says it plans to spend billions of dollars to overhaul its telecommunications network, saying the aging and brittle copper wires which were originally laid in the early 1900s do not have enough bandwidth to allow television capability."}

Inferences of nearly 150 planets in other solar systems have been observed so far by using instruments and measurements that only suggest the existence of another planet. Until now, no planet has been confirmed by the means of a photographed image. There was, months earlier, another team of scientists who took pictures of what might be another planet, but that image remains controversial because it shows what may be an even more distant object instead.\nThe research team that photographed the planet with its host star was led by Ralph Neuhaeuser of the (AIU). \"The detection of the faint object near the bright star is certain,\" he told \"Space.com\" on Friday.\nThe new image contains the star, GQ Lupi, with an orbiting planet. It is smaller than our , 70% the size, and is located 400 away from our solar system. The planet is nearly twice the size of Jupiter. Unlike our sun which is 4.6 billion years old, the GQ Lupi star is approximately 1 million years old and is considered very young for a star. The planet orbiting GQ Lupi is three times further out than 's orbit around our sun, and scientists estimate the orbiting period to be about 1,200 years. The planets wide orbiting distance from the GQ Lupi was an important element for enabling the photograph to be taken.\nThe planet, much like the star it orbits, is very hot \u2014 about 2,000 degrees Kelvin \u2014 so despite the detection of water in the planet's atmosphere, which at that temperature would make it gaseous, there is no expectation it might support life.\nThe discovery will be detailed in an upcoming issue of the journal \"\"."}

Even telephone companies are getting into the act. Cingular Wireless will be rolling out a \"Star Wars\"-themed promotion and handset downloads within the next few days, according to a company spokesman.\nSales from \"Star Wars\" tie-in merchandise have brought in a lot of money over the years. \"Star Wars\" toy sales themed with \"The Phantom Menace\" brought in $500 million. In 2002, \"Attack of the Clones\" toy sales were $225 million, according to reports.\nIn January 2003, toymaker Hasbro struck the biggest licensing deal for the brand when it agreed to pay Lucasfilm $200 million in cash and stock for the exclusive rights to make \"Star Wars\"-themed toys until 2018. That figure does not include Lucasfilm's percentage of the profit from each toy's sale.\nWal-mart and Target, the two largest toy retailers in the U.S. have entire aisles devoted to tie-in \"Star Wars\" action figures, full-sized mock ups of light sabers and other more whimsical items. Hasbro is even marketing a \"Darth Tater\" special edition of its classic Mr. Potato Head.\nThe merchandise also has a literary side. Author Matthew Stover has a monetization of \"Revenge of the Sith\" as part of a multi-book deal between Lucasfilm and publisher Random House's science fiction specialty label, Del Rey. Stover's book has consistently been in the Top 50-most ordered books, according to Amazon.com. Other \"Sith\"-themed books released within the past few weeks include coffee table picture books and behind-the-scenes documentation detailing the making of the film. "}

Cardinal Francis George of Chicago declared in 2003 that \"to some extent, even the appearance of being in some sense captured by, as we say now, the world's only superpower, would not be helpful to the mission of the church.\" Some say the choice of a French Pope would also be overly controversial.\nThe Polish-born Karol Wojtyla was the first non-Italian pope in 455 years. Though in Catholic tradition, the pope bears the title of Primate of Italy and Archbishop of the Roman Province, or for short, \"Bishop of Rome,\" this does not necessarily mean that he must be Italian, or Roman, as was demonstrated with the election of John Paul. Nonetheless, the rise of a non-Italian pope in 1978 may be followed by a desire to reclaim the chair by Italians.\nItaly will be the country with the greatest representation on the conclave, with 20 eligible cardinals. The US trails far behind at 11, and behind them are Spain (6), France (5), and Brazil (4). \nEurope forms the largest bloc with 58 papal electors, while Latin America and Africa have 21 and 11 respectively.\nJohn Paul II was a relatively unknown archbishop at the time of his election, indicating that it is not impossible for church leaders not well known throughout the church across the world to be potential recipients of the office.\nMany analysts suggest the strong possibility that the cardinals will seek to avoid electing a young pope in the wake of John Paul's 27-year reign. Age has been a factor in the choice of pontiff during the church's history, and may surface again. The \"New York Times\" speculates that cardinals may choose a slightly older pope \"in order to avoid another long reign,\" like that of John Paul II. Two well-liked figures, Angelo Scola of Venice, 63, and Christoph Sch\u00f6nborn of Austria, 60, may well be too young to be chosen for the office. Moreover, some feel that an older pope may be selected specifically to serve as a \"transitional\" figure following the previous lengthy papacy.\nAmong the most prominent 'papabili,' or likely potentials for the papacy are:\nOthers include Giovanni Battista Re, 71, president of the Vatican commission for Latin America, and Belgian Cardinal Godfried Danneels, 71.\nAnalysts suggest that among the important issues around which the election of the next pontiff will center are candidates' position on socialism and capitalism, other religions or ecumenism, abortion, homosexuality, clerical celibacy, as well as their degree of progressivism or conservatism and relations with the international community."}

Newcastle hasn't lost a single game since January 23 and looked as favourites for their April 2 home match against Aston Villa. However things haven't went as planned. On the 5th minute of the game Juan Pablo Angel scored for the away side. Villa continued to dominate and in the second half any hopes of fightback for Newcastle were shattered as Steven Taylor got sent off for the deliberate handball. The foul warranted a penalty and Gareth Barry scored from the spot. Seven minutes later he did it again, after Stephen Carr brought down Darius Vassell inside the box.\nHowever, it was not a result that disappointed Toon fans the most. Two Newcastle players, Lee Bowyer and Kieron Dyer, engaged in a fight in the middle of the pitch at the sight of the crowd. Referee Barry Knight made a decision to send both off. After the match, manager Graeme Souness made no excuse for the behavior of the players; however he defended Dyer, as it was Bowyer who started punching him. Both players could be facing 3-match bans by the English Football Association."}

The Archbishop said, \"I hope the cardinals... will follow the first non-Italian pope by electing the first African pope.\" (Note: Pope John Paul II was the first non-Italian pope since the 15th century, but not the first non-Italian pope ever, as Tutu has stated. Additionally, it would not be the first time an African pope has been elected.)\nShould such an event occur, it is widely believed that Cardinal Francis Arinze of would be the most likely candidate.

The purpose of the holiday is to remember the contribution of Scots both at home and abroad, raise the profile of Scotland, and encourage tourism and trade. \nThe date of April 6 was chosen because the \"Declaration of Arbroath, the Scottish Declaration of Independence, was signed on April 6, 1320 and the American Declaration of Independence was modelled on that inspirational document.\" In Australia and New Zealand, Tartan Day is celebrated on July 1, the anniversary of the repeal of the Act of Proscription in 1782.\nPresident George W.

This observance renews our appreciation for the diversity and remarkable heritage that unites us all.\" \nIn the US House of Representatives on March 9 last month, seven years after the Senate approval, a voice vote was unanimously taken to declare \"National Tartan Day\" a national holiday. \nThe number of Americans with Scottish or Scotch-Irish ancestry according to the 2000 US Census is about 9.2 million, comprising 3.2% of the US population."}

Roberts related the fact that Thompson was working on a story relating to the World Trade Center demolition, and did say he was going to be murdered, and that the murder would be identified as a suicide. Roberts says in the second paragraph that Thompson did, however, commit suicide, and was not murdered. \nTwo years ago in January 2003, Thompson actually did give an interview on KDNK radio (Colorado) where he made a suggestion that he may be murdered to shut him up.\n\"Bush is really the evil one here and it is more than just him. We are the Nazis in this game and I don't like it. I am embarrassed and I am pissed off. I mean to say something. I think a lot of people in this country agree with me...we'll see what happens to me if I get my head cut off next week -- it is always unknown or bushy-haired strangers who commit suicide right afterwards with no witnesses,\" the writer said.\nMore confusion has arisen after a quote from one of the police officers investigating the death scene. Deputy Ron Ryan said there was a spent shell casing, but there was no cartridge in the firing chamber, as there should have been under normal circumstances. Sheriff's officer DiSalvo confirmed this opinion; \"I think a bullet from the magazine should have cycled into the chamber\". This \"single bullet\" problem has led to speculation that Thompson was coerced into self-inflicting a gunshot wound, being given a gun with a single shot, perhaps accompanied by threats against his family.\nSpeculation arose that the gun used to kill Thompson could have been capable of a manual ammunition cycle, though as yet no support for this claim has been offered. DiSalvo said he hadn't checked the gun, but that the weapon could have been on a manual cycle that would have stopped the other cartridges from going into the chamber.\nThe spent slug was found in the stove's hood behind Hunter Thompson's body, investigators said.\nThompson died February 20. The county coroner ruled that Thompson's death was a suicide on February 21.\nOther friends were not surprised at his death. \"I wasn't surprised,\" said George Stranahan, a former owner of the Woody Creek Tavern, a favourite haunt of Thompson. \"I never expected Hunter to die in a hospital bed with tubes coming out of him.\"\nNeighbours have said how his broken leg had prevented him from leaving his house as often as he had liked to.\nOne neighbour and long-standing friend, Mike Cleverly, said Thompson was clearly hobbled by the broken leg. \"Medically speaking, he's had a rotten year.\""}

Like the parent HBO Asia channel, along with limited original programming, the new genre channels are expected to offer top Hollywood fare dubbed into local languages.\nThis is the largest expansion of HBO Asia, which has been operating in Asia since 1992 and serves 25 countries, since the launch of Cinemax Asia in 1996."}

All political parties had suspended campaiging for two days; and Mr Blair and other politicians had been attending services to mourn the death of the Pope. \nTimetable for the dissolution of Parliament.\nThe wedding of His Royal Highness Prince Charles had previously been scheduled for Friday April 8, and hence Members of Parliament (Lords and Commons) would have not sat on that day and would have stopped sitting on Thursday April 7. However, because of that subsequently being the date set for the funeral of Pope John Paul II, the wedding has been postponed to Saturday April 9. \nMembers of Parliament (Lords and Commons) will thus stop sitting on Friday April 8. This leaves just four days for all remaining legislation to be passed. It is expected that some government bills will be simply dropped, to be reintroduced in the next Parliament if the Labour Party wins the General Election.\nThe last Prime Minister's Question Time in the House of Commons is scheduled to be tomorrow, Wednesday April 6 at 11:00 UTC.\nAfter the election, the new Parliament is scheduled to be summoned on Wednesday May 11. Its first business will be the election of the Speaker and the swearing-in of members. The State Opening of Parliament is scheduled to then be on Tuesday May 17.\nGeneral Election campaigns start.\nThe calling of the General Election marks the formal beginning of the general election campaigns by the U.K. political parties, although in practice all three major parties have been actively campaigining for several weeks. The Conservative Party election slogan \"Are you thinking what we're thinking?\" was, for example, used by the party leader Michael Howard in his response to the Budget report on March 16, 2005 and was launched by the Scottish Conservatives on March 10."}

But after market research, the new owners of NWI decided that a liberal news network was not financially feasible.\nInstead, they focused on a youth-skewed news channel under the code name \"INdTV\" (pronounced \"Indy Tee Vee\").

The first group (n=120) received psychological therapy; the second (n=60) a more traditional drug routine, and the third group (n=60) only pills.\nThe study found that both treated groups recovered wellness much better than the placebo group. At eight weeks, the medication group was at 50 per cent, the cognitive therapy group was at 43 per cent while the pill placebo group had only a 25 per cent improvement.\nAfter 16 weeks both medically treated groups had about 58 per cent improvement.

The match, a Colorado State Golden Gloves bout, was held in Denver on April 2. Her opponent for the senior women's title in that match was Heather Schmitz, 32.\nZerlentes received a knockout punch in the third round by a straight blow to her left temple. She received immediate attention from ringside physicians, but never regained consciousness, even after being admitted to Denver General Hospital for emergency surgery on Saturday night. She expired on Sunday due to blunt-force trauma injuries received to the head, resulting in a blood clot on the brain.\nHer opponent Heather Schmitz met with reporters and expressed her regret, saying, \"I didn't want to hurt her. I feel very bad about that.\"\n\"Nobody thought it was a very hard blow,\" said Jeanne DePriest, manager of Zerlentes' team. \"We've been talking to people all day trying to find out what happened.\" Zerlentes was wearing her required protective headgear at the time of the accident.\nSeveral commentators have remarked on the coincidental similarities between Zerlentes' death and the events depicted in the recent Oscar-winning film, Million Dollar Baby, in which a character becomes quadriplegic as a result of a spinal cord injury suffered during her last fight.\nUSA Boxing oversees the sport of amateur, Olympic-style boxing in America, as a member organization of the International Amateur Boxing Association (AIBA). The non-profit organization has overseen men's amateur boxing since 1888, but has only admitted women to the sport since 1993. There are currently 2,200 registered women boxers, according to USA Boxing, and interest in the sport is increasing.\n\"The USA Boxing family's thoughts and prayers go out to Becky's family and husband. We are deeply saddened by this loss,\" said Sandy Martinez-Pino, president of USA Boxing.\nIn the aftermath of Zerlentes' tragic death, the USA Boxing authorities have continued to affirm their high level of safety precautions and close oversight of the sport's conditions and equipment. According to their website, amateur boxing was ranked 23rd in rate of injuries, behind soccer and gymnastics (National Safety Council, 1996) and 8th in rate of sports-related fatalities, behind football and scuba diving (Boxing and Medicine, Human Kinetics Illinois, 1995).\nZerlentes had an amateur record of 6-4 (6 wins to 4 losses), and was a former regional boxing champion with several brown belts in martial arts.

The results of the study, conducted by AssetMetrix, were released this week after 136,000 PCs running Microsoft's Windows operating system were examined. Although many of the companies in the poll are still using earlier releases of Windows, such as Windows 2000 and Windows 98, only 24% of businesses using Windows XP had successfully rolled out SP2.\nReleased in September 2004, SP2 includes security improvements for the Windows XP operating system, including an enhanced firewall and a pop-up ad blocker for Internet Explorer. When it was first made available, businesses could opt to postpone installation of the service pack so that their respective IT departments could prepare for the update. However on April 12, Microsoft will force users to upgrade to SP2 via their automatic Windows Update system, which delivers software over the Internet. AssetMetrix believe this move will catch out unprepared companies.\n\"Microsoft allowed a significant period of time to accommodate companies' demand to test and validate Windows XP SP2 within their IT infrastructure,\" explained AssetMetrix Research Labs' managing director Steve O'Halloran.\nHe added: \"Based on our research, a substantial number of companies have yet to decide whether to accept or embargo Windows XP SP2. To date, we have observed that 40 percent of companies using Windows XP have actively avoided upgrading to SP2, and only 7 percent have actively accepted it. The other 52 percent of the companies showed no direction or policy towards SP2, and may find themselves having support issues by allowing multiple editions of Windows XP to exist in their infrastructure.\""}

However the Democratic Progressive Party government did not hold any similar activities.\"\nThe chairs of Taiwan\u2019s opposition parties, the Kuomintang (KMT), New Party (NP) and People First Party (PFP) used the Tomb Sweeping Day break to lead trips to the Taoyuan county Tzuhu and Touliao mausoleums (resting spots of Chiang Kai-shek and his son Chiang Ching-kuo respectably.) Because the bodies of Chiang Kai-shek and Chiang Ching-kuo are planned to be moved to Wutzushan military cemetery in Taipei County in August of this year, the opportunity to visit the tombs of the two former leaders is almost gone.\nDemocratic Progressive Party (DPP) pays no visits to Chiang\u2019s tomb\nDuring the rule of the Kuomintang government, visiting the tombs was a major event, presidents lead the chiefs of the five branches of the government in a memorial at the tombs. Though following Taiwan's gradual shift towards democracy the visits to the tombs have become more and more simple and forlorn. After the Kuomintang lost control of the government the event even became an activity only for the Pan Blues; the DPP government not only didn\u2019t visit the tombs, they didn\u2019t even hold similar ceremonies.\nLien Chan: \u201cwould be pleased to visit the mainland\u201d\nBecause KMT Vice Chairman Chiang Pin-kun\u2019s recent visit to mainland China caused such mixed reactions in the political arena, the question of when KMT Chair Lien Chan would visit the Chinese mainland was also a hot topic. After paying his respects Lien expressed that he was honored by the invitation to visit the mainland, but a time frame for the visit is still awaiting further confirmation: \"I would be pleased to accept such of visit, and go on a 'journey of peace, the time (of the trip) should be in the near future, as for how to determine the time for certain, it will require contact from both sides to decide.\"\nJames Soong: don\u2019t rush\nAs for the People First Party chair James Soong, who in the month of February held talks with President Chen Shui-bian in the so-called \u201cChen-Soong meeting\u201d, appeared conservative in answering questions about himself visiting China: \u201cWhich party wants to rush to go first, the PFP wont do like others did and try to go against the policy, today we hope to place policy before politics.\u201d\nSoong also said that the relationship between Taiwan and mainland China is very complex, and the KMT and DPP both can\u2019t solve the problem within fifty years or five years. The PFP hopes that both sides of the Taiwan Strait can benefit; he said he believes that a relationship between the two sides is not a one-sided wish, and hopes it can take place in an atmosphere in which both sides desire not to encroach on the dignity of Taiwan. Soong also stated that he will soon be able to meet with Chen Shui-bian and Lien Chan to discuss the Taiwan Strait situation.\nJohn Chiang: tombs should become a \u201ctomb containing clothing without the body,\u201d\nAlso worth mentioning is the discussion about what will be done with the mausoleums of the two Chiangs once their bodies are moved to Wutzushan military cemetery. John Chiang, Chiang Ching-kuo\u2019s illegitimate son, said that he hopes the Taoyuan County government will be able to maintain the original spirit and cultural spirit of the mausoleums.

Currently, the operation is only available on the Internet as a streaming media web site.\nThe network started as a experiment by the Walt Disney Company-owned ABC in the summer of 2004 during the U.S. presidential campaign nomination conventions. It was mostly broadcast as a subchannel or shared channel within the bandwidth of an existing digital television (DTV) channel already owned by ABC. For instance if the local ABC affiliate is on Channel 7 with a DTV channel of 23, then \"ABC News Now\" may have been available on digital channel 23.1, sharing the same bandwidth.\nBecause few households in the U.S. are equipped to tune in digital over-the-air sub-channels, and virtually none are carried on local cable companies, ratings were low for the fledgling digital channel. Adding to that technical difficulty, cable carriage of the network was small. \"ABC News Now\" was delivered to only 6 of the 110 million U.S. households via cable. Most viewers of the network, 30 million at last count, watched the network via the Internet.\nCiting money reasons, ABC shuttered the over-the-air \"ABC News Now\" broadcasts in January to focus on building the web-based service. But come July, ABC plans to return its news network and its 20 original programs to local TV stations. Without any commitment from national cable or satellite companies, ABC will return to digital sub-channels on local DTV transmissions."}

The second of the two bursts was bright\nenough to be seen from Earth with a good backyard telescope.\"\nThe Swift science team said these types of distance measurements\nwill become routine, allowing scientists to create a map to understand\nwhere, when and how these brilliant, fleeting bursts of light are\ncreated.\nGamma-ray bursts, the most powerful\nexplosions known in the Universe, are thought to signal the birth of\nblack holes; either from a massive star explosion or a merger of\nsmaller black holes or neutron stars. Several\nappear each day from Earth's vantage point. They are difficult to\ndetect and study because they occur randomly from any point in the sky\nand last only a few milliseconds to about a minute.\nSwift, with three telescopes, is designed to detect bursts and turn on\nits own to focus its telescopes, within seconds, on the burst\nafterglow, which can linger for hours to weeks. The UVOT is a joint\nproduct of Penn State University and the Mullard Space Science Laboratory in\nEngland.\nSwift detected the bursts on March 18 and 19, as indicted in their\nnames: GRB 050318 and GRB 050319. The UVOT team estimated that the\nredshifts are 1.44 and 3.24, respectively, which corresponds to\ndistances of about 9.2 billion and 11.6 billion light years. (The\nsecond estimate reflects a more precise measurement made with the\nground-based Nordic Optical Telescope.)\nDistance measurements are attained through analysis of the burst\nafterglow.\nSwift detected 24 bursts so far. GRB 050318 was the first burst\nwhere the UVOT detected an afterglow. The lack of afterglow detection\nis interesting in its own right, Roming said, because it helps\nscientists understand why some bursts create certain kinds of\nafterglows, if any. For example, Swift's X-Ray\nTelescope (XRT) has detected afterglows from several bursts. The UVOT\ndetected afterglows in GRB 050318 and GRB 050319 in optical light, but\nnot significantly in ultraviolet.\n\"Every burst is a little different, and when we add them all up we\nwill begin to see the full picture,\" said Keith Mason, the U.K. UVOT\nLead at University College London's \nMullard Space Science Laboratory.\nMason said UVOT distance measurements will become more precise in\nthe upcoming months as new instruments aboard Swift are employed.\nSwift is a medium-class explorer mission managed by NASA Goddard Space\nFlight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland.

The Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) asked for a budget increase to about US$2.6 billion a year to fund the program.\nAerospace professor Taketoshi Hibiya, who works at the Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Technology, questioned the value of going to the moon.\n\"If you are hoping to exploit energy resources for example, the question is whether you gain more energy than you expend getting to the moon and back,\" Hibiya told \"Reuters\". \"As scientists, we want to experiment with everything, including manned flight, if we can get the money,\" he said. \"Unfortunately, the country's budget is in a bad way at the moment.\"\nJapan is running a national debt of 751 trillion yen (US$6.94 trillion).\nJapan said it would decide within 10 years whether it would pursue its moon program on its own, or if it would team up with other nations.\nNo country has sent a manned mission to the moon since the Apollo program of the 1960s and 1970s. China and Russia are both planning moon programs of their own. China plans to send a satellite to the moon in 2007. Russia has a plan to send personnel to the moon sometime between 2015-2020 as part of a larger program to one day send a mission to Mars.\nJAXA's next mission will survey the moon with the \"SELENE\" probe. The mission was scheduled to launch this year, but has been delayed for unknown reasons."}

Jonathan Terleski was able to monitor the digital conversation held between his PSP and Sony's website when the browser in his game 'Wipeout Pure' would try to download new software from Sony via the Internet. Using a suitably set up DNS server, Terleski configured his handheld console to access his own custom PSP portal, instead of Sony's website, and then invited other owners to use his gateway to the web. \nFrom this discovery, Robert Balousek later created a web based IRC interface that allows people to talk to each other and hold conversations in real time via the Internet on their PSP consoles. According to Reuters, his IRC website has to date been used by as many as 100,000 visitors and Balousek now plans to introduce a web based interface to the AOL instant messaging network for PSP users.\nOther notable recent 'hacks' include reading ebooks and comics and watching pre-recorded television shows, taken from a TiVo, on the Sony PSP.\nNone of the 'hacks' have yet employed writing custom software for the device. So far, most are spin-offs of Jonathon Terleski's web browser hack. Other hacks, like the ebook reader and television show viewer, are made possible through use of the PSP's built in tools for viewing video and images. Sony has not yet released an SDK which would allow end-users to write 'homebrew' software, therefore hackers are tied to manipulating software included with the PSP or available through the games purchased separately.\nSpeaking to Wikinews, Jacob Metcalf, who documented the web comic's hack on his website, explained his motivation: \"Web comics are already designed for on-screen reading and they have some of the same audience as people who play games - lots of the most popular web comics are about gamers, like PVP and Penny Arcade.\"\nHe added: \"I do wish that [Sony] would come out with an actual web browser like the Dreamcast had. South Korea is going to get a real web browser and I have a feeling in my gut that there is going to be Internet software for the PSP like a web browser and email announced at E3 this year.\""}

As to an alternative to Bitkeeper, Torvalds hinted that he is considering Monotone but that Subversion, a recent replacement for CVS, is out of the running. Bitkeeper was originally developed to allow Torvalds to manage code contributions more easily, according to Jeremy Andrews at Kerneltrap.org, and was previously provided to kernel developers free of charge, though it was restricted in its use.\nBitkeeper is the software that Torvalds and hundreds of other Linux developers use to manage submissions of code to the Linux kernel, the heart of the computer operating systems referred to as \"Linux\" or \"GNU/Linux\". Linux is distributed in many different forms, bundled with other software by companies such as Red Hat, Novell, and Linspire.\nWhile the details are not clear, it appears from Andrews' article that Bitmover's decision to stop releasing the free version of Bitkeeper is related to a dispute with Torvalds' employer, Open Source Development Labs (OSDL).\nAccording to Kerneltrap, an OSDL contractor had been reverse engineering the free version of Bitkeeper in order to make an open source replacement, which is prohibited by the license under which the free version of Bitkeeper is released. Nevertheless, Torvalds notes in his post that he is \"personally very happy with BK, and with Larry [McVoy, the CEO of Bitmover].\""}

Part of the program is the installation of Internet access at 450 secondary schools throughout the country.\nZenawi explained the change of heart that led to the decision to invest in this infrastructure project. \"Not long ago many of us felt that we were too poor to seriously invest in information and communication technology,\" he said at the conference. \"We were convinced that we should invest every penny we have on securing the next meal for our people. We did not believe serious investment in ICT had anything to do with facing the challenges of poverty that kills. Now I think we know better,\" he explained to the delegates.\nNot everyone thinks that the government knows better. Giovani Peri, Assistant Professor of Economics at University of California, Davis, specializes in macroeconomics and growth theory. Peri believes that the Ethiopian government may be misguided in its direct investment in the build-up of information technology, and should instead create incentives for the private sector to build such infrastructure.\nProfessor Peri likened the Internet access project to previous failed attempts by African governments to stimulate growth via large-scale projects. \"[African governments] in the past tried to build airports ... in the middle of desolation.\" \u2014 but people need to know that the environment is right for business, he said, not just a good airport. He said that the investment in Internet access might be too early for that country, and that before it is built, the country needs a good educational system to get the scientific community involved in the process of building technology infrastructure.\nEthiopia's population is mostly rural, and over half of the population is illiterate. The country's per capita is US$560."}

The inscription states, \"In Memory of Paul Ray Smith...His Spirit Lives Forever.\"\nSmith was honored posthumously by President George W. Bush on April 4, 2005 with the highest citation for valor that can be bestowed by the US Armed Forces, the Medal of Honor, for his actions during Operation Iraqi Freedom on April 4, 2003, the day of his death. During a ceremony in the White House, President Bush presented the award to Smith's family and described him as \"a soldier whose service illustrates the highest ideals of leadership and love of our country.\"\nSmith's death occurred while leading a defensive battle against over 100 of Saddam Hussein's Republican Guard. While attempting to build a holding area for enemy prisoners of war about a mile from Baghdad International Airport, Smith and the three dozen men he commanded in the 3rd Infantry Division were surprised and outnumbered. \nDuring the Medal of Honor ceremony at the White House, President Bush said, \"With complete disregard for his own life and under constant enemy fire, Sergeant Smith rallied his men and led a counterattack. Seeing that his wounded men were in danger of being overrun, and that enemy fire from the watchtower had pinned them down, Sergeant Smith manned a 50-caliber machine gun atop a damaged armor vehicle. From a completely exposed position, he killed as many as 50 enemy soldiers as he protected his men.\"\n\"Sergeant Smith's leadership saved the men in the courtyard, and he prevented an enemy attack on the aid station just up the road. Sergeant Smith continued to fire...until he took a fatal round to the head. His actions in that courtyard saved the lives of more than 100 American soldiers...We count ourselves blessed to have soldiers like Sergeant Smith, who put their lives on the line to advance the cause of freedom and protect the American people.\"\nThe US Army has revealed many details about Smiths' actions that day. While his commander was on a reconnaissance mission, he led the defence of his platoon (and the mortar team, scouts and medical aid station based nearby) by throwing a grenade, firing rockets and firing his own weapon. After a Bradley Fighting Vehicle was forced to withdraw from multiple rocket-propelled-grenade strikes and a lack of ammunition, he ordered another soldier to reverse an armoured personnel carrier back into the scene of the fight, whose original crew had been incapacitated moments before by a mortar. Smith then engaged the attacking Iraqi troops using its roof-mounted un-armoured .50-calibre machine gun, knowing it was the heaviest weapon between the attackers and the troops behind him. Smith fired over 300 rounds before he was killed. The US Army states that his actions killed 20-50 Iraqi troops, and that his actions saved the many US troops stationed nearby.\nIn an unmailed letter home, Smith said that he was ready to give \"all that I am to ensure that my boys make it home\". His Medal of Honor citation was given, \"For conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty.\"\nSmith was also the first ever to earn a Medal of Honor flag, a new award which will be given to all future Medal of Honor recipients since being authorized by Congress in a 2002 law. The flag is a simple design that consists of a blue field, fringed with gold, containing 13 white stars, similar to the Medal of Honor ribbon. "}

Most of them die. We now know that we can preserve some of them by giving direct stimuli.\"\nProfessor Bartlett explained recent research findings, including those from collaborator Jeffrey D. Macklis at Harvard in the US.\n\"There are a lot of hormones and changes in blood that go up and down after exercise, and so that may be a lead to some of the chemicals that can drive the production of nerve cells.\n\"One of the chemicals that seems to promote neurogenesis is prolactin, and prolactin levels are very high in pregnant females. Prolactin levels, by the way, also go up during sex as well. So one could think of a number of more entertaining activities than running in order to regulate the production of nerve cells.\n\"Perhaps doing something a little more inquisitive or intellectual might be good at selecting their survival. So perhaps one should run a long distance and do the cryptic crossword or something like that,\" he said.\nProfessor Bartlett gave the same suggestions as being potentially helpful in depression, last year in an interview on the ABC \"Science Show\". \nSee also.\n "}

The Pope changed it to Wojty\u0142a when he left Poland to avoid political persecution. The grandfather of Jo\u00e3o Woidyla is Jos\u00e9 Woidyla, who was brother of Pope's grandfather. Jo\u00e3o's family discovered the relationship when Karol was elected Pope. The pope himself recognized the relationship and sent him a letter.\nPope John Paul II has other cousins in Brazil too: Isidoro, Alfreda, Genoveva (Jo\u00e3o's wife) and Bolessuaf.\nBolessuaf, 86, likes to read the card written in Polish that he received from his cousin, the Pope.\n\"A great man, who always fought for the good of the others\", he adds.\nJo\u00e3o and his wife Genoveva met the pope John Paul II during his visit to Brazil in 1980.\nThe cousins got very sad when they heard that the Pope was gone. \"To me, he seems to be a brother, more than my own brother \", said Isidoro. Jo\u00e3o said about the Pope: \"I think he did the work what should be done. I hope the next one works like him\". He added: \"It is like to lose a father, I am very sad\".\nAccording to \"Folha de S\u00e3o Paulo\", Brazilian government invited Jo\u00e3o to take part in the funeral of the Pope.

The third requirement was reworded by November 2004, according to the Internet Archive: \"Maintain your normal pesticide or non-pesticide use patterns for your household. We will not ask any parent to apply pesticides in their home to be a part of this study.\"\nAccording to the above document, the area of Jacksonville/Duval County was chosen for reasons of existing year-round high usage of pesticides and other household chemicals within the home, as well as relevant data from existing prior studies. The study involved researchers visiting the home of participants, parents videotaping their children's activities with a supplied camcorder, children wearing a small \"activity sensor\", and parents collecting food and urine samples for detailed analysis of the effects of chemical exposure to common commercially available chemicals, primarily pesticides, on which \"current information... is very limited\" . \nSelection for the study began in fall 2004. As incentives for their participation in the planned two-year study, parents were to be given $970, a t-shirt, and other gifts, and would have kept the video camera at its conclusion.\nSenate opposition.\nComplaining that the study was necessary, Johnson yielded to two Democratic Senators who had threatened to block him, using all means available, from officially taking the helm of the Environmental Protection Agency, of which he is the acting head. The block on his nomination was lifted afterwards although some Democratic Senators would not say how they would vote on the final nomination.\nUnder his guidance, the EPA agreed to accept $2 million for the controversial $9 million CHEERS study from an industry trade group, the American Chemistry Council, which represents the chemical insecticide manufacturers. The study was to be conducted with the cooperation of the Duval County Health Department, and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, based in Atlanta.\nSenators Barbara Boxer (D-CA) and Bill Nelson, (D-FLA), demanded the cancellation of the study as proof of Johnson\u2019s acknowledgement of what she called a \"gross error in judgment\".\n\u201cThe CHEERS program was a reprehensible idea that never should have made it out of the boardroom, and I am just happy that it was stopped before any children were put in harms way,\" Boxer said. She added that testing on humans should not be a part of any United States environmental policy.\n\"I am very pleased that Mr. Johnson has recognized the gross error in judgment the EPA made when they concocted this immoral program to test pesticides on children,\" Boxer said.\nEPA review.\nWork on the study was halted last November by Johnson while an independent review of the study's design was conducted at his request. Part of the reason for the study's current cancellation was what the EPA in its press release has termed \"mischaracterization\" of the nature of the study as though children were being deliberately sprayed with pesticides.\nJohnson defended his approach, \"I have concluded that the study cannot go forward, regardless of the outcome of the independent review. EPA must conduct quality, credible research in an atmosphere absent of gross misrepresentation and controversy. I am committed to ensuring that EPA's research is based on sound science with the highest ethical standards.\"\nIn November 2004, William Farland, an administrator with the EPA's research department, told \"The Oregonian\", \"There's no suggestion that we are asking them to use pesticides. We simply want them to continue to carry out their day-to-day activities.\""}

Adelphia is the fifth largest cable service provider in the United States with nearly 5 million subscribers.\nThe market-share grabbing bid trumps the previous Cablevision offer of $16.5 billion. The bid is under scrutiny by the presiding judge over the Adelphia\u2019s Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing, and must also be approved by the company\u2019s creditors owed in the range of $20 million.\nThe acquisition race to gain dominance in the cable service provider market is driven by the high cost of installation and maintenance of cable lines. Fiber optic networks deliver traditional entertainment programming over a cable wire and is becoming increasingly popular for broadband internet content. The growing trust and recognition of Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) suggests phone service subscribers will eventually migrate to cable voice communication as opposed to keeping with traditional copper land lines. Telephone company operators are scrambling to keep up.\nThe largest percentage of the bid would be put up by Time Warner (TW), who could gain by getting subscribers from the valuable Los Angeles market currently owned by Comcast and Adelphia. TW can also simultaneously divest itself of a stake owned by Comcast in TW by making a tax-free swap using some of the newly garnered Adelphia subscribers.\nWhile the consolidation would likely get a look by the government with an eye towards a growing monopoly in the market, it would doubtfully be blocked considering the existence of competing technologies. Competition exists in the form of still numerous television by airwaves usage, satellite providers, radio content companies, and telecom providers.\nAdelphia suffered a corporate scandal in 1992 with similarities to the WorldCom fall. Members of the Rigas family, founders of the company, were alleged to have siphoned off millions of dollars and hidden $2.3 billion leading to the bankruptcy filing. John Rigas and son Timothy were convicted July of 2004 and await sentencing."}

However, as a persistent threat in hospitals, it tends to infect patients who are already sick and whose systems are vulnerable due to IV lines that pierce the skin. Doctors have already battled for years against drug-resistant strains of the bacteria, but the struggle has generally been confined to hospitals. \nNow, however, Methicillin Resistant Staph Aureus (MRSA) has been spreading in communities outside hospitals. Cases have multiplied by 25 times since 1998 at the University of Chicago. A Los Angeles hospital documented 14 cases of the flesh-eating infection, where patients required substantial time in intensive care and surgery. The infections are particularly problematic because nearly a quarter of people who get a staph infection require hospitalization. \nStaph infections are spread much like other diseases, with crowded conditions, poor hygiene, and skin-to-skin contact most frequently to blame. At higher risk are prison inmates, homeless people, military personnel, and families with kids in day care. Athletes also have a higher risk, because sweating makes it easier for bacteria to infect the skin. "}

Developed with the aid of Romania's business community, the new law is expected to reduce corruption and tax evasion. According to the new law, the maximum jail term for tax evasion will be boosted up to 20 years. This sentence, however, will only be passed in circumstances of large-scale fraud. For evasion of up to the equivalent of 10,000 euro, the punishment will be either a fine or up to 2 years in prison. For tax fraud of up to 500,000 euro, the term will be extended to 2-8 years in prison. It is only for those whose tax evasion exceeds 1 million euro that the jail term will range between 10 and 20 years.\nIn the same package of legislation, the government approved several changes to banckruptcy law, which makes it easier for businesses to file for bankruptcy. The new laws are expected to make Romania's business environment cleaner, resulting in more foreign investment, less corruption and more revenue for the government.\nAt the start of the year, the Romanian government introduced a new flat tax system for Romania, in which the tax rate is 19% for both personal income and corporate profit. This has led Romania to have one of the most liberal tax policies in Europe. The lower rate of tax has already reduced fiscal evasion to a significant extent because more people and businesses are encouraged to pay the tax. However, in order to further reduce the grey economy in Romania, advisers said at the start of the year that the government must also back this up with tougher legislation against tax evasion. Previously, Romania's tax evasion laws were fairly lax, leading to quite a significant extent of tax fraud. Now, with the new, highly-publicised tax evasion laws, it is expected that the risk of getting prosecuted for not paying an already-low tax rate will force many businesses out of the black market into the legal economy."}

The ethics complaints were originally filed by Democratic Rep. Chris Bell of Texas on June 15, 2004, and began to heat up in the months prior to last year's elections.\nA Texas grand jury is taking a hard look at Delay\u2019s fund raising practices, and has already indicted three of his close associates. Last week the Washington Post reported that Mr. DeLay took a trip to Moscow in 1997, financed by lobbyists of the Russian Government.\nDelay\u2019s representative, Dan Allen, told reporters \"Congressman DeLay's effective leadership to build and strengthen the House majority is exactly the reason he is being targeted by liberal groups funded by George Soros.\"\nBut Christopher Shays, a Republican from Connecticut, a Republican moderate, told the Associated Press that DeLay\u2019s \"conduct is hurting the Republican Party\" and \"hurting any Republican who is up for re-election [in 2006].\"\nThe news agency reported that DeLay would look forward to meeting the charges with the ethics committee in a sit-down and blamed all of his problems on House Democrats.\nSenator Chris Dodd, a Democrat from Connecticut, advised his Republican colleagues strongly to \u201cBe careful about how closely you embrace Mr. DeLay, as long as he's there, he's going to become a pretty good target.\" His remarks were nationally televised on ABC TV.\nThose Republicans working with the Majority Leader said his ethics are only a problem to Democrats trying to regain power in the House. But the Ethics Committee\u2019s membership is equally divided between Republicans and Democrats.\nOther Republicans are starting to get jittery about their reelection hopes if DeLay is allowed to retain power.\n\"Tom's conduct is hurting the Republican Party, is hurting this Republican majority and it is hurting any Republican who is up for re-election,\" Rep. Christopher Shays, R-Conn., told the Associated Press after making similar comments at community meetings in his home district this weekend.\nHe told reporters he thinks DeLay should step down.\nThe third-ranking Republican in the Senate, Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania, said DeLay needs to \u201cclear the air.\u201d But he thinks everything done by DeLay was \u201caccording to the law.\u201d\n\"I think he has to come forward and lay out what he did and why he did it and let the people then judge for themselves,\" he said on ABC's This Week, a Sunday political talk program. \"Now you may not like some of the things he's done, that\u2019s for the people of his district to decide, whether they want to approve that kind of behavior.\"\nSantorum faces reelection in 2006.\nState and Federal investigations of Tom DeLay.\nDeLay is under investigation by the Travis County (Texas) district attorney, Democrat Ronnie Earle, who has already indicted three members of DeLay's organization, Texans for a Republican Majority Political Action Committee (TRMPAC), on charges of money laundering and accepting illegal campaign contributions. \nDeLay and his associates are alleged to have created a front group to launder money obtained through this illegal method. The District attorney believes he is enforcing the law enacted by the Texas lawmakers.\nDeLay and his supporters contended that this investigation and the indictments were politically motivated maneuvers by the Democratic Travis County, Texas District Attorney Ronnie Earle. Earle has been characterized as a controversial and colorful political figure with a history of pursuing unconventional indictments against elected officials including Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison. However, his record shows that he has indicted more Democrats than Republicans.\nFederal investigators are probing a lobbyist, Jack Abramoff, another DeLay associate, for bilking millions of dollars from Native American casino operators for promises of congressional action to support their businesses.

Reports that he pulled the life support from his own father, when he was fatally injured in the 1980\u2019s, didn\u2019t deter him.\n\"The time will come for the men responsible for this to answer for their behavior,\" DeLay said of the judges.\nAsked what his associates think of DeLay\u2019s latest slew of bad news, spokesman Dan Allen replied, \"Members were very supportive through the week last week and going into the weekend.\"\nThe Bush administration said that DeLay has not become the political liability that Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Mississippi, became in 2002.\nLoyalty has a price.\nBoth Chris Shays and Joel Hefley, a Republican from Colorado, the past chairman of the House ethics committee who sanctioned DeLay three times, have signed a resolution, crafted by Democrats, that would end some of the rules changes that their own party pushed through to help DeLay only three months ago. DeLay voted for the changes to cover his actions as well.\nHefley said \"A lot of folks mention quietly that they are concerned about it.

The students were accompanied by two professors and an officer from the Louisiana Attorney General's office. The officer, Willie Fontenot, was subsequently asked to resign from his position at the Attorney General's office.\nMr. Fontenot has issued a response, provided to by Steve Case, a professor present at the incident. Fontenot writes,\n\"Last week, I was asked by Attorney General Charles C. Foti, Jr. to either retire or run the risk of being fired. No specifics were given to me explaining this decision by the AG. I have always understood that, as an unclassified civil servant, I served at the pleasure of the AG and that I could be dismissed at any time and for no reason. Because of my age, health issues, and investment of twenty-seven years in the state system, I decided early retirement was the best option for me.\"\nThe full text of Fontenot's statement is reproduced here.\nAccording to a press release from Antioch, the group was initially detained by two off-duty police officers who were under the employ of ExxonMobil but dressed in their police uniforms. The officers were shortly joined by two other security officers who were employed by ExxonMobil. When asked what reports the officers intended to file, \"the off-duty sheriff's department officer refused to answer, and instead responded aggressively that he was going to call in 'homeland security' people who would detain the group into the night,\" said the press release. In the end, the group was detained for \"more than an hour.\"\nOne of the professors, Abigail Abrash Walton told the Keene Sentinel that one of the officers, \"aggressively told us that he\u2019d be calling in the Homeland Security people, whatever that meant, and to expect to be with them all night.\"\nThe Keene Sentinel reports that the students were visiting the area because, \"Exxon was said to be buying up houses and paying to relocate their owners for various reasons, including that people were allegedly getting sick because of pollution.\" The other course instructor, Steve Chase, was quoted in the Sentinel as saying that, \"Our objection was not that police officers or even corporate security guards would stop and ask us what we were doing. That seemed totally fair. But lies were told, threats were made and the idea was to intimidate.\"\nThe Sentinel noted that an ExxonMobil spokesperson, Stephanie Cargile, stated that, \u201cWe believe our ExxonMobil Security personnel and the off-duty East Baton Rouge Sheriff police officers acted professionally and cordially to Mr. Fontenot and the Antioch students.\u201d The venue in which the statement was made was not mentioned by the Sentinel; thus far, the report has not been corroborated by Wikinews."}

Now, a new US-Japan study published in the April 11 online issue of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences says that milk and meat from cloned cattle does indeed appear to meet industry standards and appears to be safe for human consumption.\nAs BBC News reports, the scientists, led by Professor Jerry Yang from the University of Connecticut, compared the produce from two beef and four dairy clones, all derived from a single Holstein dairy cow and a single Japanese black bull, with the produce from normal animals of similar age and breed.\nThe meat was analysed against more than 100 physiological, tissue and cellular components, while the milk was analysed for protein, fat and other variables. No significant differences between the produce of cloned and normal cattle were found. Higher levels of fat and fatty acids were found in the cloned cow meat, but they still fell within beef industry standards.\nWhile the study showed the cloned produce to be within the range approved for human consumption, the scientists stressed that the research was still in its early stages. Their findings, they said, provide \"guidelines\" for further research with larger numbers of clones from different genetic backgrounds.\nCloning livestock may one day increase yields by copying those animals that are especially productive and especially resistant to disease.\n\"The milking production levels in the US are three to four times higher than levels in China; maybe even five times or more compared to cows in India and some other countries,\" Professor Jerry Yang told BBC News. \"Therefore cloning could offer technology for duplicating superior farm animals. However, all the products from these cloned animals must be safe for human consumption. ...and it is a major issue for scientists to provide a scientific basis for the data and information to address this question.\"\nAs USA Today reports, there is currently no law governing the sale of meat or milk from the estimated 1,000 to 2,000 cloned farm animals in the USA. But since 2003, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has asked producers to voluntarily keep the meat and milk of these animals, and that of their offspring, out of the food supply.\nWired News reports that companies like ViaGen and Cyagra, which offer livestock-cloning services, have also been waiting for several years for a final say from the FDA.\n\"For the United States agricultural industry, (cloning) can reduce the number of cows necessary for milking,\" said Jerry Yang \"They can have a pleasant environment and produce even more milk.\" He also said that cloning cattle from the United States, where genetic breeding is more advanced, could save developing countries 50 years of breeding.\nThe idea of cloning animals for human consumption is not without its critics. First, there are the welfare concerns, as most cloned animals do not make it to term before being born, and many of those that do are born deformed or prone to illness. The Humane Society of the United States has asked for a ban on milk and meat from clones for just this reason. Second, there is still the concern that healthy clones may have subtle defects that could make their food products unsafe to eat.\nAs the Washington Post reports, some critics are asking why it is necessary to clone cows that produce huge amounts of milk when surpluses, rather than shortages, are the main problem facing the U.S. dairy industry today."}
