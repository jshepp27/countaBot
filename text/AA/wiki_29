It was originally posted at Stack's site, http://embeddedart.com/. The hosting company, T35, took the site offline per an FBI request. The note is reproduced here in its entirety.\nIf you\u2019re reading this, you\u2019re no doubt asking yourself, \u201cWhy did this have to happen?\u201d The simple truth is that it is complicated and has been coming for a long time. The writing process, started many months ago, was intended to be therapy in the face of the looming realization that there isn\u2019t enough therapy in the world that can fix what is really broken. Needless to say, this rant could fill volumes with example after example if I would let it. I find the process of writing it frustrating, tedious, and probably pointless\u2026 especially given my gross inability to gracefully articulate my thoughts in light of the storm raging in my head. Exactly what is therapeutic about that I\u2019m not sure, but desperate times call for desperate measures.\nWe are all taught as children that without laws there would be no society, only anarchy. Sadly, starting at early ages we in this country have been brainwashed to believe that, in return for our dedication and service, our government stands for justice for all. We are further brainwashed to believe that there is freedom in this place, and that we should be ready to lay our lives down for the noble principals represented by its founding fathers. Remember? One of these was \u201cno taxation without representation\u201d. I have spent the total years of my adulthood unlearning that crap from only a few years of my childhood. These days anyone who really stands up for that principal is promptly labeled a \u201ccrackpot\u201d, traitor and worse.\nWhile very few working people would say they haven\u2019t had their fair share of taxes (as can I), in my lifetime I can say with a great degree of certainty that there has never been a politician cast a vote on any matter with the likes of me or my interests in mind. Nor, for that matter, are they the least bit interested in me or anything I have to say.\nWhy is it that a handful of thugs and plunderers can commit unthinkable atrocities (and in the case of the GM executives, for scores of years) and when it\u2019s time for their gravy train to crash under the weight of their gluttony and overwhelming stupidity, the force of the full federal government has no difficulty coming to their aid within days if not hours? Yet at the same time, the joke we call the American medical system, including the drug and insurance companies, are murdering tens of thousands of people a year and stealing from the corpses and victims they cripple, and this country\u2019s leaders don\u2019t see this as important as bailing out a few of their vile, rich cronies. Yet, the political \u201crepresentatives\u201d (thieves, liars, and self-serving scumbags is far more accurate) have endless time to sit around for year after year and debate the state of the \u201cterrible health care problem\u201d. It\u2019s clear they see no crisis as long as the dead people don\u2019t get in the way of their corporate profits rolling in.\nAnd justice? You\u2019ve got to be kidding!\nHow can any rational individual explain that white elephant conundrum in the middle of our tax system and, indeed, our entire legal system? Here we have a system that is, by far, too complicated for the brightest of the master scholars to understand. Yet, it mercilessly \u201cholds accountable\u201d its victims, claiming that they\u2019re responsible for fully complying with laws not even the experts understand. The law \u201crequires\u201d a signature on the bottom of a tax filing; yet no one can say truthfully that they understand what they are signing; if that\u2019s not \u201cduress\u201d than [\"sic\"] what is. If this is not the measure of a totalitarian regime, nothing is.\nHow did I get here? \nMy introduction to the real American nightmare starts back in the early \u201880s. Unfortunately after more than 16 years of school, somewhere along the line I picked up the absurd, pompous notion that I could read and understand plain English. Some friends introduced me to a group of people who were having \u2018tax code\u2019 readings and discussions. In particular, zeroed in on a section relating to the wonderful \u201cexemptions\u201d that make institutions like the vulgar, corrupt Catholic Church so incredibly wealthy. We carefully studied the law (with the help of some of the \u201cbest\u201d, high-paid, experienced tax lawyers in the business), and then began to do exactly what the \u201cbig boys\u201d were doing (except that we weren\u2019t steeling [\"sic\"] from our congregation or lying to the government about our massive profits in the name of God). We took a great deal of care to make it all visible, following all of the rules, exactly the way the law said it was to be done.\nThe intent of this exercise and our efforts was to bring about a much-needed re-evaluation of the laws that allow the monsters of organized religion to make such a mockery of people who earn an honest living. However, this is where I learned that there are two \u201cinterpretations\u201d for every law; one for the very rich, and one for the rest of us\u2026 Oh, and the monsters are the very ones making and enforcing the laws; the inquisition is still alive and well today in this country.\nThat little lesson in patriotism cost me $40,000+, 10 years of my life, and set my retirement plans back to 0. It made me realize for the first time that I live in a country with an ideology that is based on a total and complete lie. It also made me realize, not only how naive I had been, but also the incredible stupidity of the American public; that they buy, hook, line, and sinker, the crap about their \u201cfreedom\u201d\u2026 and that they continue to do so with eyes closed in the face of overwhelming evidence and all that keeps happening in front of them.\nBefore even having to make a shaky recovery from the sting of the first lesson on what justice really means in this country (around 1984 after making my way through engineering school and still another five years of \u201cpaying my dues\u201d), I felt I finally had to take a chance of launching my dream of becoming an independent engineer.\nOn the subjects of engineers and dreams of independence, I should digress somewhat to say that I\u2019m sure that I inherited the fascination for creative problem solving from my father. I realized this at a very young age.\nThe significance of independence, however, came much later during my early years of college; at the age of 18 or 19 when I was living on my own as student in an apartment in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. My neighbor was an elderly retired woman (80+ seemed ancient to me at that age) who was the widowed wife of a retired steel worker. Her husband had worked all his life in the steel mills of central Pennsylvania with promises from big business and the union that, for his 30 years of service, he would have a pension and medical care to look forward to in his retirement. Instead he was one of the thousands who got nothing because the incompetent mill management and corrupt union (not to mention the government) raided their pension funds and stole their retirement. All she had was social security to live on.\nIn retrospect, the situation was laughable because here I was living on peanut butter and bread (or Ritz crackers when I could afford to splurge) for months at a time. When I got to know this poor figure and heard her story I felt worse for her plight than for my own (I, after all, I thought I had everything to in front of me). I was genuinely appalled at one point, as we exchanged stories and commiserated with each other over our situations, when she in her grandmotherly fashion tried to convince me that I would be \u201chealthier\u201d eating cat food (like her) rather than trying to get all my substance from peanut butter and bread. I couldn\u2019t quite go there, but the impression was made. I decided that I didn\u2019t trust big business to take care of me, and that I would take responsibility for my own future and myself.\nReturn to the early \u201880s, and here I was off to a terrifying start as a \u2018wet-behind-the-ears\u2019 contract software engineer... and two years later, thanks to the fine backroom, midnight effort by the sleazy executives of Arthur Andersen (the very same folks who later brought us Enron and other such calamities) and an equally sleazy New York Senator (Patrick Moynihan), we saw the passage of 1986 tax reform act with its section 1706.\nFor you who are unfamiliar, here is the core text of the IRS Section 1706, defining the treatment of workers (such as contract engineers) for tax purposes. Visit this link for a conference committee report (http://www.synergistech.com/1706.shtml#ConferenceCommitteeReport) regarding the intended interpretation of Section 1706 and the relevant parts of Section 530, as amended. For information on how these laws affect technical services workers and their clients, read our discussion here (http://www.synergistech.com/ic-taxlaw.shtml).\nSEC. 1706. TREATMENT OF CERTAIN TECHNICAL PERSONNEL.\n(a) IN GENERAL - Section 530 of the Revenue Act of 1978 is amended by adding at the end thereof the following new subsection:\n(d) EXCEPTION. - This section shall not apply in the case of an individual who pursuant to an arrangement between the taxpayer and another person, provides services for such other person as an engineer, designer, drafter, computer programmer, systems analyst, or other similarly skilled worker engaged in a similar line of work.\n(b) EFFECTIVE DATE. - The amendment made by this section shall apply to remuneration paid and services rendered after December 31, 1986.\nNote:\n\u00b7 \"another person\" is the client in the traditional job-shop relationship.\n\u00b7 \"taxpayer\" is the recruiter, broker, agency, or job shop.\n\u00b7 \"individual\", \"employee\", or \"worker\" is you.\nAdmittedly, you need to read the treatment to understand what it is saying but it\u2019s not very complicated. The bottom line is that they may as well have put my name right in the text of section (d). Moreover, they could only have been more blunt if they would have came out and directly declared me a criminal and non-citizen slave. Twenty years later, I still can\u2019t believe my eyes.\nDuring 1987, I spent close to $5000 of my \u2018pocket change\u2019, and at least 1000 hours of my time writing, printing, and mailing to any senator, congressman, governor, or slug that might listen; none did, and they universally treated me as if I was wasting their time. I spent countless hours on the L.A. freeways driving to meetings and any and all of the disorganized professional groups who were attempting to mount a campaign against this atrocity. This, only to discover that our efforts were being easily derailed by a few moles from the brokers who were just beginning to enjoy the windfall from the new declaration of their \u201cfreedom\u201d. Oh, and don\u2019t forget, for all of the time I was spending on this, I was loosing income that I couldn\u2019t bill clients.\nAfter months of struggling it had clearly gotten to be a futile exercise. The best we could get for all of our trouble is a pronouncement from an IRS mouthpiece that they weren\u2019t going to enforce that provision (read harass engineers and scientists). This immediately proved to be a lie, and the mere existence of the regulation began to have its impact on my bottom line; this, of course, was the intended effect.\nAgain, rewind my retirement plans back to 0 and shift them into idle. If I had any sense, I clearly should have left abandoned engineering and never looked back.\nInstead I got busy working 100-hour workweeks. Then came the L.A. depression of the early 1990s. Our leaders decided that they didn\u2019t need the all of those extra Air Force bases they had in Southern California, so they were closed; just like that. The result was economic devastation in the region that rivaled the widely publicized Texas S&amp;L fiasco. However, because the government caused it, no one gave a shit about all of the young families who lost their homes or street after street of boarded up houses abandoned to the wealthy loan companies who received government funds to \u201cshore up\u201d their windfall. Again, I lost my retirement.\nYears later, after weathering a divorce and the constant struggle trying to build some momentum with my business, I find myself once again beginning to finally pick up some speed. Then came the .COM bust and the 911 nightmare. Our leaders decided that all aircraft were grounded for what seemed like an eternity; and long after that, \u2018special\u2019 facilities like San Francisco were on security alert for months. This made access to my customers prohibitively expensive. Ironically, after what they had done the Government came to the aid of the airlines with billions of our tax dollars \u2026 as usual they left me to rot and die while they bailed out their rich, incompetent cronies WITH MY MONEY! After these events, there went my business but not quite yet all of my retirement and savings.\nBy this time, I\u2019m thinking that it might be good for a change. Bye to California, I\u2019ll try Austin for a while. So I moved, only to find out that this is a place with a highly inflated sense of self-importance and where damn little real engineering work is done. I\u2019ve never experienced such a hard time finding work. The rates are 1/3 of what I was earning before the crash, because pay rates here are fixed by the three or four large companies in the area who are in collusion to drive down prices and wages\u2026 and this happens because the justice department is all on the take and doesn\u2019t give a fuck about serving anyone or anything but themselves and their rich buddies.\nTo survive, I was forced to cannibalize my savings and retirement, the last of which was a small IRA. This came in a year with mammoth expenses and not a single dollar of income. I filed no return that year thinking that because I didn\u2019t have any income there was no need. The sleazy government decided that they disagreed. But they didn\u2019t notify me in time for me to launch a legal objection so when I attempted to get a protest filed with the court I was told I was no longer entitled to due process because the time to file ran out. Bend over for another $10,000 helping of justice.\nSo now we come to the present. After my experience with the CPA world, following the business crash I swore that I\u2019d never enter another accountant\u2019s office again. But here I am with a new marriage and a boatload of undocumented income, not to mention an expensive new business asset, a piano, which I had no idea how to handle. After considerable thought I decided that it would be irresponsible NOT to get professional help; a very big mistake.\nWhen we received the forms back I was very optimistic that they were in order. I had taken all of the years information to Bill Ross, and he came back with results very similar to what I was expecting. Except that he had neglected to include the contents of Sheryl\u2019s unreported income; $12,700 worth of it. To make matters worse, Ross knew all along this was missing and I didn\u2019t have a clue until he pointed it out in the middle of the audit. By that time it had become brutally evident that he was representing himself and not me.\nThis left me stuck in the middle of this disaster trying to defend transactions that have no relationship to anything tax-related (at least the tax-related transactions were poorly documented). Things I never knew anything about and things my wife had no clue would ever matter to anyone. The end result is\u2026 well, just look around.\nI remember reading about the stock market crash before the \u201cgreat\u201d depression and how there were wealthy bankers and businessmen jumping out of windows when they realized they screwed up and lost everything. Isn\u2019t it ironic how far we\u2019ve come in 60 years in this country that they now know how to fix that little economic problem; they just steal from the middle class (who doesn\u2019t have any say in it, elections are a joke) to cover their asses and it\u2019s \u201cbusiness-as-usual\u201d. Now when the wealthy fuck up, the poor get to die for the mistakes\u2026 isn\u2019t that a clever, tidy solution.\nAs government agencies go, the FAA is often justifiably referred to as a tombstone agency, though they are hardly alone. The recent presidential puppet GW Bush and his cronies in their eight years certainly reinforced for all of us that this criticism rings equally true for all of the government. Nothing changes unless there is a body count (unless it is in the interest of the wealthy sows at the government trough). In a government full of hypocrites from top to bottom, life is as cheap as their lies and their self-serving laws.\nI know I\u2019m hardly the first one to decide I have had all I can stand. It has always been a myth that people have stopped dying for their freedom in this country, and it isn\u2019t limited to the blacks, and poor immigrants. I know there have been countless before me and there are sure to be as many after. But I also know that by not adding my body to the count, I insure nothing will change. I choose to not keep looking over my shoulder at \u201cbig brother\u201d while he strips my carcass, I choose not to ignore what is going on all around me, I choose not to pretend that business as usual won\u2019t continue; I have just had enough.\nI can only hope that the numbers quickly get too big to be white washed and ignored that the American zombies wake up and revolt; it will take nothing less. I would only hope that by striking a nerve that stimulates the inevitable double standard, knee-jerk government reaction that results in more stupid draconian restrictions people wake up and begin to see the pompous political thugs and their mindless minions for what they are. Sadly, though I spent my entire life trying to believe it wasn\u2019t so, but violence not only is the answer, it is the only answer. The cruel joke is that the really big chunks of shit at the top have known this all along and have been laughing, at and using this awareness against, fools like me all along.\nI saw it written once that the definition of insanity is repeating the same process over and over and expecting the outcome to suddenly be different. I am finally ready to stop this insanity. Well, Mr. Big Brother IRS man, let\u2019s try something different; take my pound of flesh and sleep well.\nThe communist creed: From each according to his ability, to each according to his need.\nThe capitalist creed: From each according to his gullibility, to each according to his greed.\nJoe Stack (1956-2010)\n02/18/2010"}

It is not clear who the leader of the coup is, although several military sources said that Major Adamou Harouna of the Nigerien Army was responsible.\nThe coup apparently took place during a cabinet meeting in the capitol building, and was preceded by a several-hour long gun battle in the capital, Niamy. The battle began at about 13:00 local time (12:00 UTC), ending about four hours later, with both foot soldiers and tanks involved, although no significant deployment of the military was reported. The morning after the battle, the streets were relatively quiet, and the only significant military presence is heavy artillery around the presidential palace.\nThe battle led to at least ten deaths, four of which were soldiers. The identities of those killed have not been released. Additionally, a curfew has been imposed, and the military has closed Niger's borders. Despite the crisis, the government has yet to release an official statement as to its status.\nThe actions of the military prompted condemnations of the coup from both the African Union and the nation of France, both of which called for negotiations to resolve the situation. The West African group of countries Ecowas has already dispatched a delegation to talk to the group responsible for the coup.\nThe coup came after an extended political crisis in which President Tandja has dissolved both the National Assembly and Niger's High Court, as well as extending his presidential term by three years, and removing all further limits on his term. These actions have led to increasing pressure against him and the government, culminating with a thousands-strong demonstration against the government last week."}

Monserrate had been found guilty in October of misdemeanor assault, in the criminal trial involving an alleged attack on his girlfriend Karla Giraldo. \nMonserrate was expelled from the New York State Senate last week by a majority vote of his fellow senators. The result of the vote was 53 to 8 in favor of expulsion.\nFederal judge William H. Pauley III denied a request to temporarily block the expulsion. A lawsuit had been filed by Monserrate, which had asked for a reversal of the former Senator's explusion and in addition sought a block on a March 16 special election for a replacement.\nThe New York Civil Liberties Union supported Monserrate in the case. The former Senator argued that the act of being expelled from the Senate was not appropriate, as he claimed it violated due process.\nJudge Pauley ruled, \"the question of who should represent the 13th Senatorial District is one for the voters, not for this court.\" The judge explained that the voting rights of the citizens of the district formerly represented by Monserrate would not be significantly negatively impacted, due to the proximity of the upcoming special election. Monserrate has stated that he will run in the special election, and he is not prohibited from doing so. \nThe court's ruling determined that the expulsion by the New York State Senate was not inappropriate, stating, \"the power of a body to determine the fitness of its members is embedded in American democracy.\" Judge Pauley noted, \"Similar processes to discipline have long existed in deliberative bodies at all levels of government.\"\nNew York State Attorney General Andrew Cuomo issued a statement in support of the judge's ruling. \"We are gratified that the Court has confirmed our position that the Senate had the authority to expel Mr. Monserrate,\" said the Attorney General. According to \"The New York Times\", Monserrate was expected to appeal the ruling of the court.\nMonserrate's misdemeanor assault conviction pertained to an incident where he dragged his girlfriend through the lobby while exiting his apartment building. He was acquitted by a judge of charges of felony assault. Felony conviction would have resulted in an immediate expulsion from the New York State Senate. \nMonserrate is the first politician to be expelled from the New York State Senate in almost a century. He is a former New York City police officer. Prior to becoming a member of the New York State Senate, he was a city councilman. He became a member of the New York State Senate weeks after the alleged conflict with Giraldo, and was made chair of the committee overseeing consumer affairs. Along with Democrat Pedro Espada Jr., Monserrate started a shift in control of the Senate by aligning with the Republican Party."}

Howes was best known for his invention of the Easy-Bake Oven. As director of research and new product development for Cincinnati-based Kenner Products, Howes made his famous invention in the early 1960s. The inspiration came from hearing the sentiment of a Kenner salesman returning from a trip to New York City. Kenner engineers concluded that the safest and most practical method of heating the Easy-Bake would be to use a light bulb. The bulb was later replaced by a heating element.\nHowes was raised by his German grandmother and her American husband, as his mother died soon after his birth. He attended Walnut Hills High School but left during World War II to enlist in the United States Navy. Nancy Howes remarked that his grandmother assisted him in, \"fib[bing] about his age\". Howes later attended the University of Cincinnati. According to Christopher Howes, his son, one of his first jobs at Kenner was to remove potentially poisonous chemicals from the toy Play-Doh.

The show, celebrating 25 years since the broadcast of the first episode, was aired on BBC One at 8pm UTC on Friday.\nOver 400 camera shots were taken by thirty-six camera operators, instead of the four usually used in episodes. There were also three golf buggies to relocate actors in the midst of sets. The episode had been prepared for a total of nine months. Three days before the episode, 51 cast members took part in a read-through of the script, as well as two complete dress rehearsals. With the exception of a few minor mistakes at the start of the show by Scott Maslen, who plays the role of Jack Branning, the entire episode was broadcast without any significant problems.\nThe main focus of the plot in the episode was the revelation as to who the murderer of character Archie Mitchell was. The plot, marketed as \"Who Killed Archie?\" had been running consistently in the show for several months and there had been numerous suspects. Towards the end of the programme, character Bradley Branning fell from a roof after being pursued by police officers. At this point, Stacey Slater declared to Max Branning: \"I did it. I killed Archie. It was me.\"\nTen separate possible endings for the episode had been created and rehearsed, and the identity of the killer was not known to actress Lacey Turner, who portrays Stacey, until thirty minutes before the episode broadcast. Character Ian Beale, portrayed by Adam Woodyatt, is the only remaining character that has appeared consistently in the programme since its debut in 1985."}

Operations at subsidiary airlines Lufthansa Cargo and Germanwings were also affected by the strike, but operations have returned to normal.\nThe strike began at midnight on Monday (18:00 Sunday EST) after negotiations between the airline and union, Vereinigung Cockpit, over the weekend failed to resolve the threat. According to the union, the strike was over reduced flying time for the pilots, triggered by Lufthansa's recent acquisition of several smaller airlines, which the union says is causing traffic to be diverted from union-operated routes. Additionally, the union was seeking a pay increase of 6.4% and guarantees that German labor conditions would apply to Lufthansa crews from abroad, which would reduce the incentive for outsourcing to foreign crews. In a statement issued by Lufthansa, however, the airline said that the union also demanded a greater say in the operation of the airline, which Lufthansa was unwilling to agree to.\nOn Monday, less than 24 hours after it began, the union suspended the strike, agreeing to resume negotiations. A spokesman for the union said Lufthansa and the union had reached an agreement after a hearing at a Frankfurt court, where Lufthansa had filed an injunction against the union, calling the strike \"disproportionate.\" The strike is to be officially lifted at midnight Monday, although it's unclear when operations will return to normal. While not ruling out future action, the union agreed not to strike again until at least March 9.\nThe strike has impacted around 10,000 passengers worldwide in the one day it was in place, with about half of Lufthansa's flights being cancelled. The airline attempted to accommodate the disruptions by arranging alternative travel for passengers; train travel for domestic travelers, and booking travel on other airlines for international passengers."}

According to the authors of the letter, Henry Waxman and Bart Stupak, Toyota dismissed, rather than investigated, the idea that the cars' computers were at fault. In a statement, James Lentz, the president of Toyota's American division, claimed that hardware issues were to blame, and that dealers were repairing the faulty part. Toyota also released a study commissioned from the research firm Exponent that said electronic systems were not to blame. \nAccording to the House committee, however, the study involved only six vehicles, none of which had problems with their electrical systems, and was insufficient to produce an accurate result. \"Our preliminary assessment is that Toyota resisted the possibility that electronic defects could cause safety concerns, relied on a flawed engineering report and made misleading public statements concerning the adequacy of recent recalls to address the risk of sudden unintended acceleration.\"\nThe company is under a criminal investigation, and has received two subpoenas for documents from two House committees relating to the recalls, although whether they are directly related to the letter is unclear. The documents are related to accelerator issues in several models, as well as brake problems with the Prius hybrid car, and were served earlier in in February by a federal grand jury and the Securities and Exchange Commission. Toyota has released upwards of 75,000 pages of documents under the requests.\nIn a separate, though related, development, it has emerged that Toyota last year negotiated a limited recall for two models, the Toyota Camry and Lexus ES, that were affected by the accelerator recalls, saving the company an estimated $100 million. A confidential internal presentation in July 2009 made the claim, and a month later, a Lexus ES, one of the models under the limited recall crashed in California, killing four people. The claims apparently referenced a September, 2007 recall of floor mats that could trap gas pedals, the same problem that triggered a full recall of numerous Toyota cars to fix the same problem. In the same presentation, the company claimed to have avoided recalls of another model related to rust, as well as delaying new federal safety regulations. "}

It is being called the Americans' biggest Olympic win since the 1980s \"Miracle on Ice\" victory over the former Soviet Union.\nThe game was only 41 seconds in when Brian Rafalski of Team USA fired a slap shot that deflected off Canadian star Sidney Crosby's stick and bounced past Canadian goalkeeper Martin Brodeur. \nThe Canadians evened the game on a goal nearly nine minutes into the contest on Eric Staal's shot. The capacity crowd roared its approval and the stadium announcer was still giving the details of Staal's goal when Rafalski scored again.\nCanada evened the game in the second period, but American Chris Drury put Team USA ahead again, 3-2. The Americans took a 4-2 lead on Jamie Langenbrunner's shot with just under 13 minutes left in the game.\nCrosby cut the U.S. lead to 4-3 with about three minutes left. Canada pulled goalie Brodeur, adding an extra attacker in a desperate attempt to tie the contest. The hosts had clearly outplayed the Americans, with a shot advantage of 45-23. But U.S. goalie Ryan Miller, frustrated the Canadians all night, including their last-ditch attack.\nThen with just 45 seconds left in the contest, American Ryan Kesler reached around his opponent to slap the final U.S. goal into the empty Canadian net, making it 5-3.\nThe game was just a preliminary round match, but in hockey-mad Canada, where the sport first originated, it was more than that. To lose to the United States in the Olympics on home soil was devastating. \nAfter the game, Canada fans \u2014 many in replicas of the team's red and white Maple Leaf jerseys \u2014 seemed stunned as they filed out of the Canada Hockey Place. Some Americans chanted \"U-S-A, U-S-A!\" But many Canadians, including Melissa Mazeman of Winnipeg, Manitoba, were still trying to realize what had happened.\n\"As soon as that first goal was scored within in the first minute, that did hurt, it was kind of crushing,\" she said. \"But every U.S. player \u2014 or every U.S. fan I have seen on the street \u2014 I have said congratulations [to].\"\nMeanwhile, Canadian coach Mike Babcock has replaced Brodeur in the lineup, with Roberto Luongo of the Vancouver Canucks. Babcock said Brodeur's coordination with his defensemen that led to turnovers and four goals out of 22 American shot attempts. He also noted that Brodeur did not make many big saves.\nBabcock said, \"We\u2019re in the winning business. And to win at any level you need momentum-changing saves.\"\nTeam USA fan David Loring of Colorado Springs, Colorado, one of a vastly outnumbered corps of fans wearing USA Hockey gear, gave goalkeeper Ryan Miller the credit for preserving the win.\n\"[Team USA] played really well tonight. I have to tell you, they got outplayed by Canada. We had some really good goalie work this evening. Brodeur made some nice saves, but Miller really played well tonight. That was the difference I thought.\"\nHowever, not all Americans are happy. The general manager of the U.S. men's team, Brian Burke, feels the team isn't playing at it's best. \"I\u2019m not happy with the way we\u2019ve played to this point. We have to play significantly better. We\u2019re playing with about 10 guys carrying us. They don\u2019t hand out any medals for finishing first in the preliminary round,\" Burke said.\nHe continued saying, \"Our center-ice play, we\u2019ve made some glaring turnovers that have resulted in scoring chances. And our overall intensity for 60 minutes \u2014 for the first 10 minutes in the second period, I thought we were nonexistent.\"\nChris Drury agreed saying, \"I\u2019d still say we would be the underdogs on our lack of experience, certainly now that the tournament takes on a whole new meaning with single elimination. We do need to get a lot better.\"\nThe win is the United States' first Olympic win over Canada since the 1960 Winter Olympics. It also came one day short of the 30th anniversary of the U.S. hockey win over the former Soviet Union in the 1980 Winter Olympics' Miracle on Ice in Lake Placid. \nThe victory assures the Americans an automatic quarterfinal berth. Canada could still make the round of eight, but must beat Germany in a play-in game Tuesday to reach the quarterfinals."}

However, other news agency reports put the death toll as low as fifteen.\nAn official, who requested to remain anonymous, said the accident could have begun as a result of renovation work on the Djingareyber mosque\u2014which is made primarily of mud, and was built in the fourteenth century. Construction work blocked off some of the roads, and that could have been a factor in the incident. \"The mosque is being renovated, financed by the Aga Khan, and the work is carried out by South African specialists,\" the official told the Agence France-Presse (AFP) news agency.\n\"Because of these renovations, the passage on the north side of the mosque is closed off.

We are closing all the beaches and telling people to drive out of the area.\" \nPacific Islands.\nThe tsunami hit the Gambier archipelago at approximately 6:30 am local time. The Marquesas islands were hit about an hour later. Reports from the islands indicate that there was no significant damage or casualties yet. The islands followed the tsunami alert plans put in place following the major 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami.\nNew Zealand.\nIn a statement, the New Zealand Ministry of Civil Defence and Emergency Management commented, \"[the] current assessment is for a non-destructive tsunami for New Zealand with wave heights at the shore of between 0.2 and one metre [three feet]. The first wave may arrive later and may not be the largest. Waves may continue for several hours.\"\nThe centre, which also confirmed the initial Chile earthquake, also added that \"sea-level readings confirm that a tsunami has been generated which could cause widespread damage. \"Authorities should take appropriate action in response to this threat.\"\nThe government noted that the waves were not predicted to have destructive force. According to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, the first waves would not hit the country's shores until fifteen hours after the initial quake.\n\"Stay away from the beaches. Don't go out on the water and if you are already out on the water up anchor and head to deeper water at least half a mile off shore,\" warned Coastguard Northern Region duty officer John Cowan.\nMeanwhile, the Marsden Point oil refinery, the only refinery in New Zealand, put all of its operations on hold as they were waiting for further information about the strength of the expected tsunami, according to production controller Ted Rye.\n\"We've just had a report from a trader fishing boat out at the Hen and Chick islands, about 10 kilometres off the coast, and they have noticed quite a significant surge,\" he remarked.\nNew Zealand Civil Defence Minister John Carter also appealed for residents to heed officials' warnings and stay away from shorelines throughout the day.\nAustralia.\nThe east coast of Australia was placed under a tsunami alert; the impact expected in Sydney from 8:45am local time, Sunday there, and along other parts of the New South Wales coast. Areas in Tasmania potentially affected by the quake would be under tsunami alert until 7:45am local time.\n\"Boats in harbors, estuaries or shallow coastal water should return to shore. Secure your boat and move away from the waterfront. Vessels already at sea should stay offshore in deep water until further advised,\" read a warning by the Joint Australian Tsunami Warning Center. \"[...] Tsunami waves are more powerful than the same size beach waves, with the first wave not always the largest.\"\nThe centre noted that among the areas with a \"potential tsunami threat\" include New South Wales state, Queensland state, Lord Howe Island and Norfolk Island. However, it also added that the bays and harbours of Sydney would not likely be affected by waves.\nMedia gallery.\nPlease click an image to enlarge it and see more info."}

According the French Interior Ministry, at least 47 people have been killed in France alone, with around 60 injured. Additionally, five are dead in Germany, three are dead in Spain, and one dead in each of Portugal, Belgium, and England. French Interior Minister Brice Hortefeux said that the death toll would likely rise, with around 30 people still missing.\nAccording to the French utility EDF, nearly a million homes in France are without power, largely around Brittany and central France. Full restoration of power is not expected until Wednesday. Several towns on the French coast have been flooded, with more than a meter of water on the streets in some areas. The storm produced winds upward of 100 mph and waves up to 26 feet high. Effects of the storm reached inland to Paris, where nearly 100 flights were canceled and a terminal of Charles de Gaulle Airport was severely damaged. Rail transport was also affected, with tracks flooded in both Spain and France.\nIn the United Kingdom, flood warnings have been issued for most of Britain, and warnings for severe flooding that was possibly life-threatening were issued for parts of Cambridgeshire. In London, barriers on the Thames River were raised in order to reduce the potential for flooding. The storm was expected to affect southern regions of the country as it moved northeast towards Scandinavia. \nIn a statement, French president Nicolas Sarkozy expressed his condolences to those affected, and sent France's interior minister to the areas most affected to co-ordinate a response. According to Prime Minister Fillon, the storms were a \"national catastrophe.\" On Monday, the French government officially declared the storms a national disaster, which will allow funds to be released to help affected areas rebuild."}

According to an unnamed official, the review \"will point to dramatic reductions in the stockpile, while maintaining a strong and reliable deterrent.\" \nAs part of the new policy, conventional weapons will have a greater role in the future. According to officials, there are thousands of weapons that could be retired, largely by eliminating those currently stored. The move comes as a significant step towards Obama's stated goal of reducing and eventually ending the spread of nuclear weapons worldwide.\nThe policy changes come as part of the Nuclear Posture Review, a document which is undertaken by all presidents. In addition to the reduction of nuclear weapons, Obama's review will also adjust the United States' defense towards non-nuclear options, including missile defense, largely within striking distance of the Persian Gulf to reduce the threat posed by countries such as Iran. \nA centerpiece of the new policy is a new plan called the \"Prompt Global Strike,\" which involves a new type of conventional weapon that could be fired from the U.S. and reach anywhere in the world within an hour, providing an effective option for attacks worldwide, such as against a missile launch from North Korea or a strike against Al-Qaeda in Pakistan. The new weapons would achieve the same effects as nuclear weapons, without the threat of conventional war escalating into nuclear war.\nThe changes reflect a new focus on nonproliferation and arms control by the Obama administration, policies that were largely dismissed by the Bush administration. In conjunction with new domestic policies, the Obama administration is trying to win passage of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, which would ban all nuclear explosions for any purposes. \nThe treaty was defeated in the 1990s, during the Clinton presidency, and still faces strong resistance in the U.S. Senate. The Obama administration is also trying to revise the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty to close loopholes that have been exploited by North Korea and Iran.\nThe administration has also been pressured to redefine the role of America's nuclear arsenal. Democrats have been pressuring the administration to formally declare that the role of America's nuclear weapons is solely to deter nuclear attack on the United States. \nAmerican military officials, as well as some officials within the White House, however, have urged the administration to retain more ambiguous wording from the Bush era, which says that nuclear deterrence is only the primary role of American nuclear weapons, which would leave open the option of using nuclear weapons against enemies that threaten the US with chemical or biological weapons."}

A state banquet will also be held in his honor at the palace, where he is set to spend two nights.\nZuma, a member of the Zulu tribe, was compelled to make a public apology following a love child with the daughter of a friend. This incident triggered the articles in Daily Mail and Daily Mirror which attacked Zuma.\nZuma, whose state trip includes meetings with Gordon Brown, David Cameron and Nick Clegg, as well as a speech to members of parliament, plans to continue with the visit. This was confirmed by officials today.\nVincent Magwenya, Zuma's spokesman said the incident would have no impact in Zuma's trip. \nMagwenya stated: \"Mr Zuma is in the UK for wide-ranging programme of substantial and serious issues. The comments he made were not aimed at the British public in general but at certain sections of the media which have lambasted him for what he considers to be his culture. Mr Zuma had a meeting with British journalists yesterday and was asked not one question about his private life\".\nHe also added that Zuma did not \"appreciate reading things which he considers are patronising to his culture\" and claimed that it was obvious that \"his comments will have no bearing on the state visit.\" The President, according to Magwneya, looks forward to the visit and will continue with the full schedule.\nMeanwhile, the Democratic Alliance, South Africa's principal opposition party, stated that the reports in the British newspapers did not warrant Zuma's lashing out at Britain.\nKenneth Mubu, of the opposing political party said, said: \"Instead of rising above predictable criticism from a particular quarter of the British press, he has allowed himself to be dragged down to the level of the tabloids. By accusing the British people of believing that Africans are barbaric and inferior, he has insulted his hosts, and no doubt undermined the entire purpose of the state visit \u2013 which is to strengthen relations between South Africa and the United Kingdom.\"\nThe youth sector of the African National Congress supported the President. It expressed its disgust at the British reports.\n\"British media seem to have developed a habit of rubbishing our president and constantly portray him as barbaric and of inferior belonging,\" the youth league said. \"It is quite apparent that the British media is the one that is characterised and defined by the worst form of barbarism, backwardness and racism. These British racists continue to live in a dreamland and sadly believe that Africans are still their colonial subjects, with no values and principles. They believe that the only acceptable values and principles in the world are British values of whiteness and subjugation of Africans,\" stated the party."}

Regardless of the increase, China still spends significantly less on its military as a proportion of its gross domestic product (GDP) than other countries around the world. China spends about 1.4% of its GDP on the military, while the United States spends about 4% of its GDP on the military. The US, which accounts for 48% of the world's military spending, has frequently encouraged China to be more transparent about its military spending, a challenge which China said it was meeting.\nAt a press conference, Mr. Li said that the increase was in response to various security threats to China, although the nature of the threats were not specified. He did, however, say that, \"The only purpose of China's limited military strength is to safeguard China's sovereignty and territorial integrity.\" He also said that the government has limited military spending to the best of its ability, and had tried to ensure a balance between the military and other needs.\nAccording to US military analysis and official Chinese reports, China has been steadily increasing military spending since the late 1980s, when the country began a program of improving its entire armed forces, including developing and producing weapons and equipment. The US Pentagon issued a report in 2009, saying that military spending had increased by an average of 12.9% annually since 1996. Based on this, analysts say that the earlier large spending increases could explain the slower increase for 2010. China in the past few years has seen dramatic spending increases in other sectors, especially costs related to the global financial crisis, and these sectors have complained about the amount of military spending. As one analyst, David Shambaugh from George Washington University, put it, \"There have been complaints from some other sectors that it has been distorting expenditures. Maybe some of those arguments have come home to roost.\""}

The passage came even after the White House warned the panel that the vote would harm talks between Turkey and Armenia, and US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton asked the panel not to proceed with the vote. Additionally, a Turkish parliamentary delegation aimed at convincing panel members to defeat the resolution also had gone to Washington to plead their case.\nJust minutes after the US resolution passed, Turkey issued a statement condemning \"this resolution which accuses the Turkish nation of a crime it has not committed.\" Additionally, Turkey said that their ambassador to the United States had been immediately recalled for consultation. Armenians, both in America and overseas, welcomed the vote, however, with the Armenian government calling the passage of the resolution \"an important step towards the prevention of crimes against humanity.\"\nThe fallout from the vote threatened to disrupt talks between Turkey and Armenia intended to return the two countries to normal diplomatic status. These talks which were acknowledged by President Obama earlier this week in a telephone call to Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan thanking him for his efforts in the negotiations. Additionally, the resolution significantly dampens relations between America and Turkey, which is America's staunchest Muslim ally. The US government is dependent on Turkey for its access to northern Iraq, as well as its efforts to regionally isolate Iran, and the government will undoubtedly be working to limit the diplomatic fallout from the resolution.\nThe events that prompted the resolution were the deportation of Armenians from the Ottoman Empire, the precursor to the current Turkish state, in 1915. Either disease, starvation or deliberate killings by Turkish troops killed around a million and a half Armenians during the deportations and other events during World War I. Since then, more than 20 countries worldwide have officially condemned the actions as genocide. Turkey, however, has rejected the term, and maintains that there was no deliberate attempt to annihilate the Armenian people."}

King disappeared February 25 while jogging in a park near Lake Hodges in Escondido. A body believed to be King's was found Tuesday near the lake shore. DNA matching of semen found on the victim's clothing identified Gardner as a suspect, according to a spokesperson for the California Department of Justice. Gardner was arrested Sunday near Lake Hodges.\nA preliminary hearing in the case is scheduled for March 18.\nThe murder charge carries the special circumstance of being committed during a rape. Deputy District Attorney Kristen Spieler stated that the special circumstance makes Gardner eligible for the death penalty. The charges carry a penalty of 25 years to life if prosecutors choose not to pursue the death penalty.\nGardner is listed in California's registered sex offender database with a home address in Lake Elsinore, about 75 miles north of San Diego. He had been visiting his mother at her Rancho Bernardo townhouse at the time of King's murder.\nKing had planned on going on a run in Rancho Bernardo Community Park on the afternoon of February 25. Her family called police when she did not return home at dark. King's BMW was found in the park's parking lot, locked, with her cell phone and other belongings inside. Nothing indicated that anything violent had occurred in the vehicle.\nAbout 125 professionally-trained search-and-rescue volunteers combed through an area between the park and Lake Hodges. 6,000 other volunteers searched areas around North County, coordinated by the Texas-based Laura Recovery Center. Searchers found a body about 1 p.m. (13:00) local time (2100 UTC) on Tuesday, in a shallow grave about ten feet from a tributary that leads to the lake. The search had already covered that area but had missed the body. A diver searching the tributary spotted it from the water. According to San Diego County Sheriff Bill Gore, there is a \"strong likelihood\" that the body is King's; however, the District Attorney's office does not plan to release positive identification until the preliminary hearing.\nSan Diego police say they have connected Gardner to a December 27 attack on a 22-year-old jogger in the same park where King disappeared. Gardner is also under investigation in the February 2009 disappearance of 14-year-old Amber Dubois in Escondido. In May 2000, Gardner was convicted of a forcible lewd act on a child and false imprisonment. A 13-year-old female neighbor accused him of molesting her and punching her repeatedly in the head.\nIn the 2000 case, prosecutors had originally charged Gardner with more-violent crimes that could have put him in prison for 30 years. They granted Gardner a plea agreement allowing him to be charged with lesser crimes \u2014 and receive a shorter sentence \u2014 in order to \"spare the victim the trauma of testifying\". With the reduced charges, Gardner faced 11 years in prison. The judge agreed to the prosecution's recommendation that the sentence be reduced to six years. Gardner served five years and was released in 2005. He wore a tracking device until his probation ended in 2008.\nDr. Matthew Carroll, the staff psychiatrist who interviewed Gardner in 2000 stated that \"the defendant takes no responsibility whatsoever for his actions...\" and that \"it is my opinion that [the defendant] would be a continued danger to underage girls in the community.\" However, Dr. Divy Kikani, a psychiatrist who had treated Gardner for bipolar disorder, said that Gardner was \"extremely remorseful\" and \"highly motivated\" to get help. A then-girlfriend, ex-girlfriend, and Gardner's mother all expressed support for him in the 2000 case.\nChelsea King's parents, Brent and Kelly King, are arguing for changes in sex offender laws following their daughter's death. Kelly King stated that current law \"lets every child in this country down.\""}

Brown made his statements while testifying before the Chilcot Inquiry. At the time of the invasion, Brown was the Chancellor of spending for the British Armed Forces.\nBrown comments were mainly directed at critics who had alleged that he had limited the spending budget for the war. Brown said that he had told then Prime Minister Tony Blair that he \"would not try to rule out any military option on the grounds of cost.\" One of the most notable criticisms involved the use of the Snatch Land Rovers, a patrol vehicle used following the invasion. People had complained that the vehicles were vulnerable to road side bombs. Brown, however, alleged that he fulfilled all requests for better vehicles. Regarding the Land Rovers, Brown said that he moved to replace them as soon as he heard complaints.\nIn addition to defending his budget decisions, Brown also defended the overall decision to go into Iraq. Brown said that invading was \"the right decision\" and that it was based on \"the right reasons.\" He said the international community was justified in its invasion. However, Brown admitted he may have been unknowledgeable about certain aspects of the war, and hinted that the possibility that things could have been done better. Brown mentioned that there were \"learnt lessons\" from the war. One specific regret he made was that did not apply more pressure towards America regarding their plans for Iraq following the invasion. During the testimony, Brown emphasized the importance of post-invasion planning and reconstruction. Brown also mentioned that he was unaware of doubts that another Cabinet member had about the validity of the evidence that Saddam Hussein was harboring weapons of mass destruction. The member, Robin Cook, later resigned because of his opposition to the war. This is relevant because both the UK and America had claimed that Hussein had had the weapons, and used this as part of their cases for the invasion. It was later revealed that Hussein had never had the weapons. \nIn addition to the issues regarding his handling of the war, Brown is also in the situation of being up for reelection. The main opponent of Brown, who represents the Labour Party, will be David Cameron, from the Conservative Party. The elections will be held on June 3, 2010. "}

The United Nations and international aid agencies plan to immunize 85 million children under five. More than 400, 000 volunteers and health workers will take part in the campaign, visiting children in their homes.\nThe current polio epidemic has been going on for a year and there have been outbreaks in the last six months in Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Chad, Guinea, Liberia, Mali, Mauritania, Senegal and Sierra Leone. These countries will be the focus of the campaign, along with Benin, Cape Verde, Central African Republic, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea-Bissau, Niger, Nigeria and Togo.\nEfforts last year failed to halt the disease because not enough children were vaccinated. The program failed in part because local religious leaders told parents that the vaccines would sterilize their children, or cause AIDS. As well as targeting more children, today's campaign features better training for volunteers. Vaccinations will be repeated on 26 March in the six key countries, and again on 24 April for all 19 countries involved. The campaign is funded by Rotary International who have provided $30 million.\nIn 2009 the World Health Organization reported that approximately 1,600 children were paralysed by the virus worldwide."}

The research team concluded that a giant asteroid killed dinosaurs over 65 million years ago. The asteroid crashed into Yucat\u00e1n, Mexico creating the Chicxulub crater. Their report was published Friday in the academic journal \"Science\".\nIn 1980, Louis Alvarez and son, Walter, had published a paper stating that an asteroid had killed the dinosaurs. The Chicxulub crater was also discovered in Mexico at approximately that same time, therefore the theory gained scientific acceptance. More recent explanations of the cause of dinosaur's extinction included that perhaps volcanic eruptions on Deccan traps or multiple asteroid crashes ended the dinosaurs' existence.\nThe team performed chemical analyses of soil and fossil samples, where a high concentration of iridium (which is commonly found in asteroids and meteors) was found, which dated back to the approximate time of the asteroid crash. \nThe asteroid measured approximately 7.5 miles wide, and hit with an impact of one billion times the force of the Hiroshima atomic bomb. The impact would have immediately killed all animals and plant life within the radius of half of a continent. With such an impact, debris would have flown into the air and then fallen back into the atmosphere with the force of a ballistic missile.\nThe crash of this asteroid into the earth would have also caused the equivalent of the heat of ten noonday suns, which would have burned the skin or feathers of dinosaurs, and created wildfires on any plant life which had survived to that point. The crash would have also triggered massive earthquakes and tsunamis, possibly causing parts of continents to fall into the ocean.\nThe area of Yucat\u00e1n which the asteroid struck had also been rich in sulfur, which was blasted out of the earth and into the sky, where it would have mixed with water vapors, creating clouds that rained sulfuric acid, and which would block out the sun for approximately a decade."}

Peter convinced the girl to meet him via several other social networking websites. Reports said Hall had notified her mother that she was going to visit one of her friends. According to text messages, she believed that she was departing to meet Cartwright's father.\nAshleigh Hall's dead body was discovered in a field in the town of Sedgefield. A short time after the murder, police officers arrested Chapman for minor traffic violations. After being escorted into the police station, he told police officers of his offences while being questioned. A CCTV camera recorded Chapman saying to police officers: \"I killed somebody last night.\" The police then followed him to the location of the body.\nA police notice had been issued in relation to the disappearance of Chapman, who has been convicted in the past for previous offences and was still on parole at the time of his arrest. According to a Merseyside Police statement, the notice was not issued until nine months after they realised Chapman had disappeared from his residence. The notice was issued in September 2009, a month before Hall's murder. \nDuring a trial in Teesside Crown Court, Judge Peter Fox QC stated to Chapman: \"This was an evil scheme very carefully brought, and with considerable detail to trap your victim.\" Peter Chapman was found guilty of offences of kidnap, rape, and murder. Fox sentenced him to a minimum of 35 years in prison, stating to Chapman that \"[f]or what it is worth, I cannot foresee your release.\"\nIn 1996, Chapman was given a seven-year jail sentence for the rape of two prostitutes. In that incident, he threatened to attack the two prostitutes with a knife. He has also been suspected of committing several other offences of sexual attacks and rapes against young women, but was never charged in any of those instances. Chapman has been listed on the Violent and Sex Offender Register since 2000.\nAndrea Hall, the mother of Ashleigh, said outside the courthouse: \"Them sort of people shouldn't be allowed out into society anyway. I blame them [the authorities] for letting them out.\" In a video, she stated to the media: \"Just put the message out that please, parents whose kids are on Facebook, please ask them to tell you who they're talking to. You just don't know who is behind that photo. Look what happened to my daughter. It's unimaginable, what me and my family have gone through. I've got three other children that probably won't have a life now because I'll never, ever keep my eye off them. I'd also like to say thank you to the community and to all my friends for the support that they have given me through this.\"\nFacebook have also released a statement advising Internet users not to meet any individual in person that they have previously met online unless they know who the individual is. They said that \"there are unscrupulous people in the world with malevolent agendas\". Graham Reeds QC, who was on the prosecuting side, noted: \"Having invented 19-year-old Peter to make contact with girls, he now decided to invent Peter's dad in order to persuade Ashleigh that it was safe to get into his car. The plan he devised was calculated and wicked and it worked.\"\nThe leader of the murder inquiry was Chief Superintendent Andy Reddick, who also gave his opinion about this incident. \"Ashleigh made a mistake and paid for it with her life,\" he commented. \"Her death and this murder trial should be a wake up call to parents and Internet companies around the world to ensure as far as they can, that nothing happens to another innocent victim.\""}

Cotton products would face the highest penalty, with the tariff increasing from 6% to 100%. Other American products will be included in the sanctions as well, although the tariff increase will not be as significant.\nAccording to a Brazilian official, a wide range of products was chosen, in order to \"maximize pressure.\" The tariffs will go into effect in 30 days, unless the two countries can reach an agreement before then.\nThe subsidies cited by Brazil as justification for the tariffs pay out around $3 billion to American cotton growers annually. Brazil has argued for eight years that these subsidies were the reason that the US was the second-largest producer of cotton in the world, and in 2008, the WTO ruled that they were illegal. The National Cotton Council in America, however, argued that that the system of subsidies has changed since the WTO's first ruling on the matter in 2005.\nA senior executive at the council said that the subsidies were justified, and that they were an \"important financial safety net for producers.\""}

A U.S. federal judge had previously upheld the expulsion, in a ruling issued in February.\nMonserrate was expelled from the New York State Senate on February 9 by a majority vote of his fellow senators. The result of the vote was 53 to 8 in favor of expulsion.\nIn the lower U.S. District court decision, federal judge William H. Pauley III denied a request to temporarily block the expulsion. A lawsuit had been filed by Monserrate, which had asked for a reversal of the former Senator's explusion and in addition sought a block on a March 16 special election for a replacement. The New York Civil Liberties Union supported Monserrate in the case. The former Senator argued that the act of being expelled from the Senate was not appropriate, as he claimed it violated due process.\nJudge Pauley ruled, \"the question of who should represent the 13th Senatorial District is one for the voters, not for this court.\" The judge explained that the voting rights of the citizens of the district formerly represented by Monserrate would not be significantly negatively impacted, due to the proximity of the upcoming special election \u2013 scheduled for March 16. Monserrate has stated that he will run in the special election, and he is not prohibited from doing so. \nMonserrate's opponents in the March 16 special election include Jose Peralta, a sitting member of the New York State Assembly and a Democrat, and Republican Robert Beltrani.

We'll have more to say when we read the opinion.\" The hearing on Friday before the U.S. Federal appeals court lasted approximately one hour. During the hearing, one of the appellate court judges commented that Monserrate was aware that what he had done was, \"a crime, (and) you\u2019re not supposed to do it.\"\nMonserrate's misdemeanor assault conviction pertained to an incident where he dragged his girlfriend through the lobby while exiting his apartment building. He was acquitted by a judge of charges of felony assault. Felony conviction would have resulted in an immediate expulsion from the New York State Senate. \nMonserrate is the first politician to be expelled from the New York State Senate in almost a century. He is a former New York City police officer. Prior to becoming a member of the New York State Senate, he was a city councilman. He became a member of the New York State Senate weeks after the alleged conflict with Giraldo, and was made chair of the committee overseeing consumer affairs. Along with Democrat Pedro Espada Jr., Monserrate started a shift in control of the Senate by aligning with the Republican Party."}

While minors are still prohibited from sending nude photos of other minors taken on cell phones, they will no longer be required to register as sex offenders. Instead, they could be punished with court-ordered supervision or community service.\u00a0\nThe bill, which was sponsored by State Representative\u00a0Darlene Senger from Naperville, passed with a 114\u20131 majority and will be considered by the Illinois Senate. The lone dissenter, State Representative\u00a0Careen Gordon from Morris, declined to comment on her vote.\u00a0\nSenger says that sexting has become a problem because when teens send nude pictures of themselves to their boyfriends or girlfriends, they don't realize that what they are doing is illegal or that their pictures can be distributed to other people. A national survey has revealed that 48 percent of teenagers have received sexual text messages or emails, while 39 percent have sent or posted sexual photos online.\nCriminal charges are more serious if the content is posted online. As Connie Burch told \"Illinois homepage.net\", however, \"the threat of having to register as a sex offender goes too far.\" The main purpose of the legislation is to create awareness among parents about what has become a prevalent issue for teenagers. As Senger told the \"Chicago Sun-Times\", \"We still have the ability to prosecute those whose intent is to create child pornography even if they're under 18.\u00a0However, if you're just doing something because you think it's a prank, we can explain why this isn't funny.\""}

Such footage included \"reports\" that Russian forces had bombed Georgian military bases and a civilian airport in the capital of Tbilisi. Additionally, the report claimed that Russian forces had killed Georgian soldiers in South Ossieta, the site of the 2008 war.\nAccording to the network, the intention of the broadcast had been to show what could have happened if Russia had invaded again and killed Georgia's president. To this end, the broadcast was bookended at the beginning and end with a notice that the events were a simulation of possible events. The network did not, however, run such notes during the program itself, and many who watched it became alarmed by the events it covered. According to one local news agency, Georgian emergency services had received a spike in the number of phone calls during the time the broadcast was on air. \nAround two hours after the program finished, the network began running scrolling text on further programs, apologizing for the broadcast, and the head of Imedi's parent company issued a statement apologizing for the \"distress\" that the broadcast had caused. Despite the apologies, which included one from a Georgian official, the reaction to the broadcast was generally one of opposition and anger. The leader of the Georgian Orthodox Church, Patriarch Ilia II, issued a statement saying that, \"This kind of experiment is a crime to our people and to humanity,\" and an opposition politician labeled the report as \"disgusting.\" One woman who had been affected by the 2008 conflict said that, \"it wasn't right of them to do it.\""}

Despite the attempts by the film crew to obscure the film's story and intent, it appears the Scientology organisation still found out about the movie. The crew says there were reports of a Scientology spokesman tailing them at one point. Notebooks were also stolen from the trunk of director Niki Stein's car. Not too long after the theft, Stein received an anonymous call whose caller stated, \"We know you're making a movie about Scientology,\" and promptly hung up.\nThe film highlights concerns in Germany about the organisation which the government considers to a business, an abusive one at that and not a religion. The government is so concerned about Scientology that the group is monitored by the country's domestic intelligence services. Tensions reached a high during the making of the movie \"Valkyrie\", which starred Tom Cruise, a well known Scientology celebrity in his role as Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg, the Wehrmacht officer who attempted to assassinate Adolf Hitler.\nCarl Bergengruen, the head of TV movies for S\u00fcdwestrundfunk (SWR or Southwest Broadcasting), the public broadcaster backing the project defended their secrecy practices saying, \"Scientology kept trying to use a variety of methods to find out details about the project. We had reason to worry that the organisation would use all the legal means at its disposal to prevent the film from being broadcast.\" He added, [As such, the project was] \"kept under wraps for as long as possible for security reasons.\"\nMeanwhile, Volker Herres, programme director for ARD dismissed the charges leveled by Scientology at the film's screening saying, \"We're not dealing here with a religion, rather with an organisation that has completely different motives. Scientology is about power, business, and building up a network. Its lessons are pure science fiction, it's no religion, no church, no sect.\"\nScientology has endured further controversy in recent weeks and months. Back in October of last year, Paul Haggis, director of the Oscar-winning film \"Crash\" and writer of \"Million Dollar Baby\", which also won an Oscar, quit the Scientology organisation over its stance on same-sex marriage. Then last week, a feature article in \"The New York Times\" highlighted fraud and abuse that had occurred to a couple who were members of Scientology's high ranking Sea Organization or SeaOrg."}

Commander Steven Drysdale was in charge of the nuclear-powered submarine in May 2008, when it struck a rock pinnacle 132 metres below the surface. A navigation chart showed the pinnacle, but Drysdale said that he had misread its depth as 732 metres.\nOfficer of the Watch Lieutenant-Commander Andrew Cutler and Navigating Officer Lieutenant Lee Blair were also reprimanded for their part in the incident by the court martial, held at the HMS Nelson centre at Portsmouth naval base.\nThe \u00a332 million submarine was in the Red Sea, heading for the Persian Gulf, and was suffering from technical problems at the time which were slowing it down. The officers decided to dive from 100m to 250m, which would allow them to travel faster and reach their destination on time.\nAccording to prosecutor Captain Stuart Crozier: \"The three defendants all looked at the chart and the sub was taken to 250m. No thorough check was made to establish whether this depth was safe from obstacles.\"\nLieutenant-Commander Cutler then realised that a change to the route could shorten it. \u201cOn assessing the chart, Officer of the Watch Cutler saw he could cut the corner of a dog-leg, saving about three to four miles,\" said Crozier. \"He then instructed the plot officer to draw a new line on the chart. However Lieutenant-Commander Cutler did not check the depth around this new track.\"\n\"Unfortunately, with the sub now dived to 250m, this new track went directly over a pinnacle which showed only 132m of available depth.\"\nThe new route was plotted directly over the pinnacle on the chart, and the court martial was told that this made it harder to spot the error. None of the officers, including Commander Drysdale, realised that they had put the vessel on a collision course.\n\"HMS Superb\" struck the pinnacle at 10.01 on May 26, suffering damage to its bow and sonar equipment. There were no casualties, but the submarine was forced to abandon its mission and return to the United Kingdom. It was decommissioned in September 2008, though the Ministry of Defence said that this was not due to the accident.\nCommander Alison Towler, representing Drysdale, said that he accepted full responsibility and had \"deep remorse and regret\" over the incident. \"He believes that due to the surrounding information he simply misread 132m as 732m\" she said. \"It was only later that he realised the plot officer had drawn the sub\u2019s new transit straight through the pinnacle, which made it even harder for it to be seen.\"\nNavigating Officer Blair also pleaded guilty to failing to take into account all the dangers in or near the planned movements, and Officer of the Watch Cutler pleaded guilty to failing to supervise the plot officer adequately. All three officers will continue to serve in the Navy, but Drysdale has been moved to a desk job and will not be taking up the position in Washington DC he had planned to.\nCaptain Philip Warwick, president of the court martial board, told the three: \"It was indeed fortunate that no one was hurt and we note that the submarine could not complete its deployment in full. The failings were unacceptable and we take an extremely dim view of them.\"\nThe Royal Navy has since brought in new procedures on submarines to prevent a repeat of the incident, requiring that all depths are rechecked when plotting a new route."}

They set up a barricade and booed him, blocking his motorcade. The fire had destroyed a large portion of the tombs, which are as much as 128 years old. They are revered by the Buganda tribe, the largest in Uganda.\nThere are accusations that the blaze was started intentionally.

I've seen four people who were injured [...] But the crowd has been largely chased away.\"\nThe president pledged that he would look into the accusations of arson, although he commented that the demonstrators at the \"scene of the crime\" might have interfered, making an investigation more difficult. \"I am suspicious. This could be arson. The problem is the place has been tampered with. [...] [B]ut we are going to investigate and get to the cause,\" Musveni told the mausoleum caretakers.\nJudith Nabakooba, a spokesman for Ugandan security forces, told Agence France-Presse that \"[t]here was a group that confronted security at the scene before the arrival of the president. They were violent, when they confronted us we shot in the air to disperse them.\"\nA Buganda official, Medard Ssegona Lubega, remarked about the blaze to the BBC Network Africa, saying: \"There are many men of our fallen kings lie in this house, which is now down to ashes,\" he told the BBC's Network Africa It is something that we have built and kept and maintained for our children and grandchildren and many generations unborn.\"\nBuganda is one of the country's four ancient kingdoms; the United Nations' cultural organisation, UNESCO, designated it as a world heritage site.

The boy, who has not yet been identified, was found behind a Spar convenience store in the town of Cwmcarn at 1815 GMT on Tuesday. The baby was found to be wrapped in a towel which was in a plastic shopping bag. Bystanders who were walking past the scene mistakenly believed that the bag had been unintentionally left there by a person who had visited the gym that is located next to the store.\nA 14-year-old boy, who is the son of the man who owns the convenience store, then examinied the bag and discovered the baby. He made a phone call to the emergency services, however, when the baby was taken to Royal Gwent Hospital, it was pronounced dead on arrival. The baby was younger than one day old at the time of his death. A post-mortem examination proved to be indeterminate. Gwent Police have now launched an investigation to try and determine the identity of the baby's mother.\nGursewak Singh, the father of the person who discovered the baby and the owner of the shop, explained: \"We asked friends and colleagues what the bag was doing there, but it didn't belong to anyone. A boy who works with us said it was just a towel in there and he didn't open it. In the evening I went out to it and opened it, only saw a towel on top and didn't look thoroughly. I just thought it was clothes underneath and didn't want to root through them. I picked it up and hanged it on the gatepost so someone walking by might see it and recognise it as theirs. At about six o'clock there was a power cut and my 14-year-old son went out and picked up the bag and opened it and saw a little head in there. He called his uncle and said: 'It's not clothes, come and look'. They came over and saw the baby in there.\" Singh commented that this incident \"was shocking. We were all devastated. I wish we had checked earlier. If we had gone through the bag we could have made a difference. I'm worried what sort of condition the person who left the bag is in. We are so concerned about her. Other people saw the bag, but nobody thought about it. There could be a baby still alive. I wish we had checked straight away.\"\nGwent Police member Superintendent John Burley stated about this case: \"We are extremely concerned about the health and wellbeing of the mother of the baby and are appealing for her to come forward to receive any medical treatment she may require. This is a tragic incident which will sadden the local community and our priority at the moment is finding the mother of the baby. I would appeal to anyone who may have been in the vicinity of the Spar store on Thursday morning or afternoon who may be able to offer any information to assist our inquiry.\""}

According to Eide, the two parties had conducted \u201ctalks about talks,\u201d but they had broken down completely after Pakistan's arrests. In an interview with the BBC, he said that \"the Pakistanis did not play the role that they should have played.\" Pakistan's actions have prompted some speculation that the country was opposed to a peace deal between Western nations and the Taliban, or wanted to take a greater part in the talks. Pakistan, however, has denied the arrests were intended to disrupt talks between the UN and the Taliban.\nEide said that the talks between both sides had begun around a year ago, and had continued until several weeks ago, with a pause for the Afghan elections. While other avenues for communication exist, including via the Afghan government, Eide said that it would take at least several weeks for such talks to resume after the disruption.\nPeace talks between the two sides are widely seen as necessary to gain peace with the Taliban, although the approaches taken by European countries and the United States are almost opposite. The US announced a significant military buildup in Afghanistan last fall, and is trying to weaken the Taliban military before engaging in talks. Western European countries are pushing for more immediate negotiations, and officials such as David Miliband, British foreign secretary, are focusing on engaging all but the most militant members of the Taliban."}

He received cuts and bruises and a black eye after being scratched and hit by the kangaroo. Mount Ainslie is located near the centre of the Australian capital, with Australia's parliament houses designed to be viewed from the top of the mountain. \nHe does not remember much about the incident, only that he turned around and saw the kangaroo which hit him in the face. He said that the kangaroo scratched him at first then guessed that it must have hit him which caused him to lose consciousness. He was taken to hospital by a motorist who was passing by. At the hospital he was given x-rays and a tetanus shot before being discharged.\nStriegl had been jogging up the mountain during his lunch break. Joggers and cyclists are common on the mountain, which is located a few kilometres from the city centre. He was a former Australian rules footballer, and says he had never been in a fight, until being hit by the kangaroo. He had seen kangaroos box each other before but didn't know they would box people. He said he would not have thrown a punch back if he had the chance because of their status as a national symbol, and he has no hard feelings against kangaroos. His colleagues at the United Group Ltd. real estate office where he works have given him the nickname \"Skippy\", after the famous television show. He said he will continue jogging at the reserve, but with company next time.\nInjuries from kangaroos in Australia are rare, and it is almost unheard of for someone to be knocked out by one. This attack comes a year after a kangaroo crashed through a window of a house in Canberra before rampaging through the house."}

According to BA, around 65% of the airline's passengers will be able to reach their destinations, despite 1,100 of the normal 1,950 flights being canceled. The effect of the strike varied between airports; while all flights were operating from London City Airport, only 60% of long-haul and 30% of short-haul flights were expected to operate from London Heathrow Airport. At London Gatwick Airport, all long-haul flights and around half of short-haul flights were still operating.\nThe strike began after last-minute negotiations between BA and Unite collapsed. BA and Unite have been at odds for some time; in November 2009, BA announced plans to reduce the number of crew on many flights and institute a two-year pay freeze from 2010. While Unite says it recognizes the need for costs to be cut, it also claimed it was not consulted on the means to do so.\nThe strike also has political implications in the United Kingdom, as Unite is one of the largest backers for Prime Minister Gordon Browns' Labour Party. The opposition Conservative Party have called on the Labour Party to sever financial ties with Unite during the length of the dispute, saying that \"Labour's dependence on funding from Unite is compromising their ability to stand up to the unions and stand up for the interests of passengers.\""}

One of the patrons was in a serious condition upon arrival at Bathurst Hospital due to being allergic to an ingredient in the cleaning product. \"He presented to the emergency department as he was having an allergic reaction after eating a burger from Hungry Jacks, he was in a really bad way when he arrived here and if he had waited much longer it could have been much worse,\" said a Greater Western Area Health Service employee. \"We called Hungry Jacks and they said that three of their employees had been goofing off and sprayed multi-purpose cleaner inside the burgers so we then treated the patients for poisoning.\"\nBoth customers are expected to make a full recovery. During an investigation undertaken by Wikinews reporter Nathan Carter, it was learned that the chemical sprayed into the burgers was KAY multipurpose cleaner which is reported to cause nausea, diarrhoea and mucosal and gastric irritation.

Due to restrictions on the publication of the name of young people involved in crimes in New South Wales, the names of kitchen staff can not be published. Wikinews was told by Hungry Jack's staff that the staff involved in the incident remained employed by Hungry Jack's.

It would be based off an earlier plan, called the M\u00e9rida Initiative, that was introduced by the Bush administration three years ago. According to Hillary Clinton, the new strategy would not supersede the older initiative, but would rather supplement and expand upon it. Other American officials said the new plan would lead to additional efforts to introduce systems that would enable those transporting drugs to be apprehended before they reached the border, rather than just constructing a better defense at the border. \nThe new plan would also eliminate funding for military defense systems in favor of training for civilian police officers. Under the original M\u00e9rida Initiative, much of the $1.3 billion spent was on military equipment such as aircraft for Mexican forces.

An American official said that while \"we are still working to finalize the treaty,\" diplomats from both sides said they were optimistic that the deal was near completion.\nThe new-found optimism came after a recent breakthrough in negotiations, which have taken nearly a year, longer than either the Americans or Russians expected. Originally, the treaty was to be negotiated in London of April 2009, but the completion date was then pushed back to December 2009, a deadline that passed with no deal.\nContentious issues in the negotiations included devising a way to make sure each side was complying with the requirements, the sharing of technology between the two sides, and how to limit defense programs in both countries. While an original plan for an American defense system was abandoned by Barack Obama, a second plan presented by the US was also opposed by the Russians, which were pushing for language that would restrict the American nuclear program. The final text will be composed of largely non-binding language recognizing the relationship between different types of weapons.\nUnder this text, both countries would be forced to reduce their deployed nuclear warheads to around 1,600, down from a current limit of 2,200. The treaty would also require the arsenal of \"delivery vehicles,\" aircraft or missiles that can carry the warheads, to be halved to 800. Arms-control advocates consider the reductions in the treaty relatively minor, but the Obama administration hopes to end negotiations with a simpler and more straight-forward treaty as a way to rebuild trust with the Russian government in preparation for more drastic changes in the future."}

The biggest announcements included abolishing stamp duty on homes under \u00a3250,000 for first-time buyers, whilst increasing it to 5% on homes over \u00a31 million. In his statement to the House of Commons, the Chancellor claimed that the Labour government had made the right calls in countering the global recession, but warned that introducing cuts too early would jeopardise the recovery.\nOpposition leader David Cameron attacked the Budget, saying that the headline stamp duty plans were stolen from his own Conservative party. He criticised the amount of government debt, expected to be \u00a3167 billion this year, pointing out that it was more than every previous Labour government's borrowing added together. Cameron continued his call for spending cuts to decrease the deficit, saying it was time for a \"radical change of direction\". Darling however maintains that it is too soon.\n\"I know there are some demanding immediate cuts to public spending,\" said the Chancellor to the Commons. \"I believe such a policy would be both wrong and dangerous. To start cutting now risks derailing the recovery \u2013 which is already bringing down borrowing more rapidly than expected.\" This year's expected government debt is less than the \u00a3178 billion that was forecast in December 2009's pre-Budget report.\nThere will be an estimated 2.2% real terms rise in government spending this year, and several spending announcements were made. However Darling warned that cuts will follow after 2011, and could be \"the toughest for decades\". The Conservatives have said that if they win the upcoming election, they will introduce an \"emergency Budget\" less than 50 days after taking office. \nAmong the plans announced by the Chancellor today are a green investment bank to support renewable energy and low-carbon industries. This will have \u00a32 billion, half raised by sale of government assets, including the Channel Tunnel Rail Link, and half raised from private investment. Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds will also have to provide loans worth \u00a394 billion to businesses, with small and medium sized companies receiving at least half of this. These companies will also have access to a new credit adjudicator to oversee banks' decisions on loans.\nThere will be a sharp rise of 10% in tax on cider, with wine, beer and spirit duties rising at 2% above inflation as planned. These changes will occur from midnight on Sunday, and tax on alcohol is set to increase a further 2% for two years from 2013. The previously scheduled increase in fuel duty will still happen, but will now be staggered over a longer period.\nOther changes include a freeze of the threshold for inheritance tax for the next four-years, whilst higher winter fuel payments for pensioners will be maintained for another year."}

The second aftershock had a magnitude of 5.1, and occurred at the 10:57 local time (14:57 UTC), with its epicenter located 15 kilometers north of Cobquecura.\nThe National Emergencies Office graded the scale of the seisms on the Mercalli scale, which attempts to quantify the amount of physical damage caused by an earthquake. The intensities of the smaller aftershock were determined to be V in Pichilemu, III in Talca and II in San Fernando, while the larger 5.1 magnitude earthquake only hit IV in Pichilemu, but registered a IV in Talca as well, due to its closer proximity to that city.\nThursday morning the Municipality of Pichilemu posted a letter via Facebook to all those affected by the February 27 and March 11 earthquakes in the surrounding areas of Pichilemu, like Ciruelos, Alto Ram\u00edrez, and others. However, they didn't name the village of Espinillo. The mayor of Pichilemu, Roberto C\u00f3rdova, was criticized for not giving aid to the village.

The remainder would be supplied by the International Monetary Fund. \nGermany and France were the architects of the document, which was subsequently approved by the other members of the eurozone. While it is seen as a partial retreat for countries such as France that previously opposed any IMF participation in the loans, it is nevertheless regarded as a breakthrough in negotiations. Germany had been insistent on relatively strong terms for the plan, a large amount of which was in the final version.\nDespite the agreement, there are no plans for it to take immediate effect, as the Greek government has not requested financial aid, and officials said that they hoped the option would never have to be used.

While initial reports said the cause may have been a torpedo attack by North Korea, South Korean officials have since denied any military altercation.\nThe 1,200 tonne ship was reported to have begun sinking between 9:30 and 10:45 PM local time (1345 UTC) on Friday night near Baengnyeong Island. While no cause was confirmed by authorities, an explosion occurred in the rear of the ship and there was much speculation about the possibility of a North Korean torpedo attack. A spokesperson for the government, however, said that judgement on the cause was being withheld until an investigation was conducted, and South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff said that there was insufficient evidence to implicate North Korea. By the day after the incident, South Korean officials had said that North Korea was not involved, as there was no indication of North Korean military activity in the area the ship sank.\nThe Yonhap news agency said that a South Korean ship had fired shots at another, unidentified, North Korean vessel, although whether the incident occurred before or after the vessel began sinking is unclear. A later report said that the target may have been merely a flock of birds.\nAccording to the ship's captain, one of those who was rescued, there was \"the sound of an explosion and the ship keeled to the right.\" The initial explosion caused the ship to lose power and communications, and the ship sank rapidly, with the rear underwater five minutes after the explosion.\nA rescue operation was immediately undertaken by South Korea, with several of the involved vessels rescuing 58 people. The remaining 46 that were on board the ship are presently unaccounted for, and it is increasingly unlikely that any more survivors will be picked up. The South Korean government has convened an emergency meeting in response to the incident, and the military has activated an emergency task force.\nThe sea around the Korean peninsula has been the site of previous incidents between the two navies, including deadly battles in 1999 and 2002, and a smaller firefight last year."}

However, the University of Chile Geological Survey reported that the seism reached a magnitude of 5.9.\nThousands of inhabitants of Copiap\u00f3 ran evacuation plans in offices and schools. The seism set off many alarms in cars and enterprises, according to radio stations. Parents went to take their children out of the schools. It was reported earlier that cornices fell down from buildings, businesses lost merchandise and cellphone networks encountered problems in the area.\nThe ONEMI reported no damages or injuries, but some roads collapsed. Power and water distribution were not affected. Eva Cansino, ONEMI boss, told TVN that the citizens' reactions demonstrated particular sensitivity to seisms, and she pointed out that it helps to minimize the risks in similar situations. She added that this seism was not an aftershock of the February 27 Maule or March 11 Pichilemu earthquakes, which destroyed many places in the central and south areas of Chile.\nSantiago felt the earthquake to a lesser degree. The earthquake was felt between the Antofagasta and O'Higgins regions.\nONEMI also reported the intensities of the seism in three regions according to the Mercalli scale:\nJoaziel Jamett, from ONEMI, reported that the tsunami alert was discarded in the coast of the Atacama Region, at the 12:45 local time (15:45 UTC). \"SHOA (Servicio Hidrogr\u00e1fico y Oceanogr\u00e1fico de la Armada de Chile / Chilean Army Hydrographic and Oceanographic Survey) has discarded any tsunami in the Atacama Region, therefore we have to keep the people quiet\", reported Jamett to B\u00edo B\u00edo Radio.\nToday marks one month from the earthquake and tsunami combo that hit the most of Chile central and south part. This is the second seism that has occurred in the north of Chile in the last few weeks, after the 6.3 on March 4.\nAlmost ten minutes before this earthquake, at 11:39:08 (14:39 UTC), another March 11 earthquake aftershock was felt between the O'Higgins and B\u00edob\u00edo regions. It reached 4.3 grades, and had a depth of 32.4 kilometers. The epicentre was located 16 kilometers at the southeast of Pichilemu. It lasted about 15 seconds. Another aftershock occurred at the 13:14 (16:14 UTC), reached 3.7 grades, had a depth of 10.8 kilometers, and the epicentre was located 12 kilometers at the east of Pichilemu.

Riley granted a temporary restraining order filed by the\u00a0American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Illinois.\nWhen Judge Riley issued another ruling yesterday, he said the ACLU lawsuit was flawed, finding the law itself to be constitutional. He added, however, that \"the law in question is a rather unfortunate piece of legislation\" that is inherently discriminatory against pregnant minors.\u00a0\nACLU lawyers plan to file an appeal, which Judge Riley will rule on with a new restraining order in place. They argue that the law is an invasion of privacy and dangerous to minors who live in an abusive environment. The Illinois Attorney General's office is defending the law, saying that parents should be able to give their children advice on complicated matters.\u00a0"}

Byee The End\"; in it he instructed them to look at the camera and declare: \"We will miss you, Mummy.\" After recording the video, he strangled them both.

The new document says that the US will use nuclear weapons only in \"extreme circumstances,\" although it did not specify what those circumstances would be. It also commits the US to not develop new nuclear warheads, although the country's arsenal of conventional (non-nuclear) weapons will be maintained.\nThe document does, however, contain two major caveats. Only countries that comply with the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty are subject to the new limitations, meaning that India, Israel, North Korea, and Pakistan would be exempt from the limitations, as these countries are non-parties to the treaty, and Iran would be except while in violation of the treaty. Also, the new strategy will maintain the option of reconsidering the pledge not to use nuclear weapons in retaliation to a biological attack, but only if it was judged that such technology had reached a point where the US was vulnerable to such an attack.\nThe revised strategy is expected to be controversial among both conservatives and liberals, who have, respectively, argued against reducing the power of nuclear weapons and advocated for a pledge to never initiate nuclear warfare.

Yet today\u2019s deployed nuclear weapons are still sufficient to extinguish modern civilization. In addition, nothing has changed about the fundamental inhumanity of nuclear armaments, because their use would affect military targets as well as civilian populations indiscriminately, and thus would be generally contrary to existing international humanitarian law, based on the advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice.\"\nThe physicists are particularly concerned about the proliferation of nuclear weapons, expecting \"that a regional use of nuclear weapons could become more likely if more states or even terror groups obtain access to weapons-grade fissile material\". Having a closer look to the continued work of weapon laboratories of the nuclear powers, they state: \"We cannot accept that nuclear weapons continue to be developed today.\" Strengthening the non-proliferation requires the \"nuclear powers to meet their responsibility for complete implementation of the Non-Proliferation Treaty\", who pledged in its Article VI \"to pursue negotiations in good faith on effective measures relating to cessation of the nuclear arms race at an early date and to nuclear disarmament\".\nThe DPG addresses in its statement the perspective of a nuclear weapon free world as outlined by US president in his Prague's speech last year and that has been supported by 's president, .

Both countries are estimated to have well over 2,000 warheads now. \nThe agreement also slashes by more than half the number of missiles, submarines and bombers that carry the weapons.\nThe pact replaces the 1991 (START I), which was signed by U.S. President and Soviet President in the final days of the . START I expired in December of last year. The treaty complements the other two nuclear arms reduction treaties signed by the United States and Russia, which where the 1993 Russia, which where the 1993 treaty and the 2002 also known as SORT.\nObama said the treaty is a big step forward for world security. \"Today is an important milestone for nuclear security and nonproliferation and for U.S.-Russia relations,\" he said.\nMedvedev said because of this treaty, the entire world community has won. The Russian leader said the year-long negotiations were tough, but hard work on both sides brought success.\n\"That enabled us to do something that just a couple of months ago looked like 'mission impossible.' Within a short span of time we prepared a full-fledged treaty and signed it,\" he said.\nObama says, in addition, that the treaty paves the way for future arms reduction talks with Russia, mainly on short-range nuclear weapons. \"This treaty will set the stage for further cuts, and going forward, we hope to pursue further discussions with Russia on reducing both our strategic and tactical weapons, including non-deployed weapons,\" he said.\nTom Collina, research director at the Arms Control Association, says the new treaty is significant in reducing the threat from U.S. and Russian nuclear weapons, but more significant because it could lead to further cuts. \n\"We think we can even go to deeper reductions, and we hope they sign a new treaty after this one relatively soon. But this treaty is a great step forward, it is very important, and it puts U.S. and Russian arms control back on a firm footing, and, again, sets us up for deeper cuts,\" he said.\nThe signing of the \"New START\" treaty is one of several arms control developments taking place in several weeks. \nEarlier in the week, President Obama announced a major shift in U.S. nuclear policy. He said for the first time that preventing nuclear proliferation and nuclear terrorism is at the top of the U.S. nuclear agenda. The threat of destruction by Russian warheads is now considered a secondary menace.\nUnder Obama's nuclear posture review, the U.S. pledges not to use nuclear weapons on non-nuclear countries that abide by their nonproliferation obligations.\n, a former arms control adviser to President , says the president's nuclear posture review is based on a false and dangerous premise. \"The idea that he can, by reducing America's nuclear arsenal, contribute to the universal abandonment of nuclear weaponry. It will not happen. It will not happen on his watch. It will not happen ever,\" he said.\nObama also plans to hold a conference on nuclear security next week in Washington, D.C..\nIn their hour-and-a-half meeting before the ceremony, President Obama urged Medvedev to support new U.N. sanctions against Iran for its refusal to stop enriching uranium. The Russian leader said the issue is not whether to impose sanctions, but what kind of sanctions.\n\"Smart sanctions should be able to motivate certain parties to behave properly, and I am confident that our teams that will be engaged in consultations will continue discussing this issue,\" he said.\nObama said, \"We are working together at the to pass strong sanctions on Iran and we will not tolerate actions that flout the (Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty).\" He added, \"My expectation is that we are going to be able to secure strong, tough sanctions on Iran this spring.\"\nThe nuclear treaty is almost certain to be approved in the . However, Russian Foreign Minister has said Russia reserves the right to drop out of the pact if it believes U.S. missile defense plans for Europe threaten its security.\nMany experts agree passage in the is not as certain, but that its prospects are good. To ratify the treaty, it will require 67 votes, to pass it will require votes. Republicans in the Senate have expressed concerns that too many restrictions have been placed on America's nuclear arsenal.\nHowever, Obama is confident the treaty will be ratified when asked during a press conference following the signing. Obama stated, \"And so I'm actually quite confident that Democrats and Republicans in the United States Senate, having reviewed this, will see that the United States has preserved its core national security interests, that it is maintaining a safe and secure and effective nuclear deterrent, but that we are beginning to once again move forward, leaving the Cold War behind, to address new challenges in new ways.\"\nObama also noted, \"[T]hat both in Russia and the United States, it\u2019s going to be posed on the Internet, appropriate to a 21st century treaty. And so people not only within government but also the general public will be able to review, in an open and transparent fashion, what it is that we\u2019ve agreed to.\" Copies of the treaty and it's protocol have been posted on the State Department's website."}

The move will make a group with a market value of US$8 billion. The deal has been negotiated since July 2008.\nUnder the plan, both companies keep their own brands and operations, but will be owned by International Airlines Group, a new holding company.

The polls, both independent and those conducted on behalf of political parties, predict that the Conservatives will win only 40% of constituencies, 10% short of that needed for a majority government.\nIn the UK political system, each of the constituencies, whose number rose from 646 for the previous election to 650 for the May 6th poll, is represented by one Member of the House of Commons elected under a first-past-the-post-system. Under normal circumstances this usually favours one party, which if it wins over half of the seats, will hold a majority government.\nWith a working majority the ruling party can implement its legislative programme without the co-operation of opposition parties. However with small majorities party whips have to struggle to ensure that their backbenchers remain healthy, turn up for and actually vote in favour of their party's legislation; to prevent parliamentary rebellions the party leadership may need to moderate their policies or make concessions to factions within their own party.\nIf a party fails to gain the 326 or more seats needed for an outright majority, then the incumbent party is the first to be given the chance to attempt to form a coalition government by negotiating with the smaller parties.\nIn a coalition government the MPs of the junior partner are in effect taking the party whip of the senior party. Depending on how much their aid is needed, the junior party may gain in return some of the Minor Offices of State and some junior ministerships. The senior party may also adopt some parts of the junior party's manifesto or to abandon parts of its own. The stability of such coalitions will depend on how closely aligned the parties are politically, for example the Unionist parties and the Conservatives are traditional allies.\nIn normal circumstances the 'fringe' parties such as The Green Party, UKIP and the controversial BNP, would be of no consequence. Unlike the elections for the members of the European Parliament, which uses proportional representation, the support for these parties, though significant, is too widely dispersed to have an impact. However, due to the disaffection with the main stream parties caused by the Parliamentary expenses scandal, there is a possibility that one or two seats may fall to the minor parties.\nAs the third party in British politics, the Liberal Democrats would be the main target of negotiation, and their leader Nick Clegg has been described as a potential kingmaker, with electoral reform\u2014especially the introduction of proportional representation\u2014being the traditional price for their support. However, after Labour Party reneged on their 1997 promise of electoral reform, they are unlikely to enter formally into a coalition with Liberal Democrats.\nIf the incumbent party is unable to negotiate a majority, then the party with the greatest number of seats is given the chance to form a government; this may be the incumbent party itself. If not, it will likewise attempt to negotiate with the smaller parties in order to gain a majority. It is only when this has failed that the party with the most seats may opt to govern as a minority government.\nA minority government would be constrained as to its ability to legislate. More specifically, it would not be able to enact legislation without either the formal support, usually with a quid pro quo, of the opposition parties. The minority government could also propose legislation that is attractive enough to tempt opposition backbenchers to defy their own whips and support the government. Although the situation may seem unattractive to the political parties, the inability of any party to make major changes without a consensus across the house makes it attractive to some voters.\nHowever, the instability and unpredictability of a minority government would be of concern to financiers who warn of further financial and economic troubles if such a regime came into power. Nick Clegg, the Liberal Democrat leader, suspects that it could to lead to social unrest like that in Greece in recent days. History has shown that the ruling party would find it impossible to work as a minority government, leading to an early general election.\nAlthough such calculations have not been part of Westminster politics since 1974, they have been prevalent in the devolved Scottish and Welsh legislatures. The Scottish Liberal Democrats formed a coalition with Labour in the first two sessions of the Scottish Parliament, and the Welsh Liberal Democrats were in coalition with Labour in the Welsh Assembly from 2001 to 2003. \nEither way, whether the election results in a coalition or minority government, the possibility of the first hung parliament since the general election of February 1974 will be on the mind of at least the leaders of the political parties, if not the voters themselves."}

Sky TV, meanwhile, quoted officials as saying that three people are reported to be missing. The authorities say the landslide was due to a broken irrigation pipe, which caused rocks to fall onto the tracks below. Authorities say they are looking into why the pipe burst.\nThe trains front car hit two trees upon derailment, local media says, which prevented it from dropping off into a river below. The carriage, however, was hanging over the river, and firefighters had to use cables to stop it from falling any more. A crane was also dispatched the scene to help clean up debris, ANSA reported.\n\"The train is hanging off the rails about five meters from the river. It is now only a few trees that are holding up the train and preventing it falling into the river,\" said a witness, Alex Rowbotham, to the BBC.\n\"[...] The landslide occurred at the very passage of the train. It hit the train,\" said Thomas Widmann, a transport official for the city of Bolanzo.\nThe crash was the deadliest in Europe since February, when eighteen people died after two commuter trains ran into each other near Brussels, Belgium. Italy saw its worse rail crash two decades ago, when 29 people died following the derailment of a freight train carrying petroleum gas, resulting in several explosions."}

He added that the security forces had opened fire only when fired upon.\nThe Prime Minister's statement came as he was suffering a double blow to his authority. As coffins draped in Thai flags paraded through Bangkok to symbolise the death of democracy, Thailand's electoral commission ruled that Vejjajiva's Democrat Party should disband. In addition, the chief of the Thai Army, General Anupong Paojinda, publicly called for the dissolution of parliament.\nDespite pressure from the Vejjajiva administration, the Thai Army, which traditionally has been politically significant in the country, has been reluctant to use force against the protesters, and will become even more so following what will be seen as innocent blood on its hands. \nEven though Vejjajiva has stated that the government and military remain united, without the unequivocal support of the Thai military and security forces, his administration has very little room for maneuver.\nIronically, Vejjajiva may be saved from having to concede to the Red Shirts' demands for fresh elections through the same process that deposed his predecessor and led to his own rise to the premiership. A court has ruled that Vejjajiva's Democrat Party accepted \n258 million baht in illegal campaign donations from cement maker TPI Polene. Under Thai law, the courts have the power to dissolve any party ruled to have broken electoral laws and to ban its members from public office for five years. This is the same law that in 2008 resulted in the disbanding of the People's Power Party and the removal of Somchai Wongsawat from office. Leaders from both sides of the political divide have welcomed this development as a way to resolve the current deadlock.\nHowever political commentators note that even with fresh elections the impasse that led to what is now known as \"Black Saturday\" would not end. Thai society has become increasingly polarised into pro-Thaksin Shinawatra and anti-Thaksin Shinawatra camps, and neither side will be willing to see the other side in power whatever the results of elections. \nThe violence on April 10, 2010, the worst for 20 years, saw the death of 21 people, four soldiers and sixteen civilians, including Reuters reporter Hiroyuki Muramoto."}

He said, on a televised broadcast in Chile, that \"Many psychologists and psychiatrists have shown that there is no link between celibacy and paedophilia but many others have shown, I have recently been told, that there is a relationship between homosexuality and paedophilia. This pathology is one that touches all categories of people, and priests to a lesser degree in percentage terms.\" He also claimed to have documents of scientific studies proving his claims.\nHis statements were immediately criticized by several gay rights groups in both South America and Europe. The president of Italy's largest such group, Arcigay, Paolo Patan\u00e9, says \"The equation between homosexuality and paedophilia is a false, despicable and anti-scientific statement that affects the lives and dignity of millions of gay and lesbian people.

Kazhakstan's secretary of state and Foreign Minister called this \"an important step\" to stabilize Kyrgyzstan, thereby preventing conflicts in the country.\nThe whereabouts of Bakiyev's brothers, whom Roza Otunbayeva, the interim President of Kyrgyzstan had refused security was not clear. The Interfax news agency of Russia mentioned witnesses claimed the deposed president had boarded the plane without his brother. Bakiyev\u2019s son, Maksim, is already away from Kyrgyzstan. Details about Bakiyev\u2019s departure and its planning was also not known.\nEarlier today, gunshots were heard in south Kyrgyzstan during a political rally held by the deposed Kyrgyz President. This attack caused no injuries, but Bakiyev took a car to leave the rally after the shots were heard.\nBakiyev has been holding political meetings in towns near Teyit. Thursday's rally was in Osh, the largest city in south Kyrgyzstan, where the former was addressing a crowd of 5,000 people. Bakiyev arrived in a convoy consisting of minivans at Osh, where another rally supporting the country's interim government was being held.\nAziza Abdirasulova, a human rights activist, told \"The New York Times\" agency that when Bakiyev started addressing the crowd, supporters of the interim government came running at him. His bodyguards fired in the air and Bakiyev was assisted into a car and driven away from the city. She affirmed that no one was wounded. Eyewitnesses confirmed what Abdirasulova said, adding that the other political meeting was being held about 300 meters by members of the interim government. Two of Bakiyev's brothers were in the convoy with him.\nBakiyev fled from the capital on April 7 after a violent riot where people attacked government building. At least 83 people died in this violence in the Kyrgyz capital. \"He killed all those young people. All the people are against him. How can he even turn up here?\" commented Alikh Mansurov, an unemployed dweller of Osh. While there is no arrest warrant against Bakiyev, his brother Zhanybek has one against him. The latter was once the head of the state guard service, and accompanied Bakiyev in the convoy.\nBakiyev has claimed he would resign his post if the interim government assured security to him and his family members. The latter have agreed to make such security guarantees to Bakiyev, but have refused it for him family members. They also said Bakiyev would either have to leave the country or be prosecuted, blaming him for corruption and the violences which occurred earlier this month. On Wednesday, Roza Otunbayeva, interim President of the country, said she would consider a direct discussion with Bakiyev but refused to discuss what would happen to his relatives.\nUnited States President, Barack Obama has expressed his support for the interim government of Kyrgyzstan. Robert Blake, the assistant secretary of state for South and Central Asian affairs of the US, met with Otunbayeva on Wednesday.

The official death toll stands at 617, while 9,980 more were injured and an additional 313 reported as missing. The Chinese ministry of civil affairs reports that 15,000 houses had collapsed and 100,000 people - almost the entire population in the area - remain without homes.\nThe plateau where the earthquake hit is frequently visited by tremors; however, there are rarely many casualties due to its remoteness and small population. However, in May 2008 a heavy 8.0 magnitude earthquake struck near Sichuan foothills, killing 80,000 people.\nLogistical problems.\nRescue efforts are underway, but impeded due to the area's remoteness and landslides, which have blocked many roads in the area. Also a factor is the high altitude at which the area is located - about 4,000 metres above sea level (13,000 feet) - which could adversely affect rescue crews not used to being in such thin air. Sniffer dogs, for instance, who aren't accustomed to working at high sea levels, could have a harder time detecting living people buried beneath rubble.\nPower and telephone lines were also downed by the temblor, affecting communication, although the authorities commented that electricity and phone links have been repaired to tens of towns.\nChina's state media reports that troops garrisoned in the Yushu county, with help from locals, have already rescued over a thousand people buried beneath debris.\nResidents and troops garrisoned in the Yushu county have managed to pull out more than 1,000 people alive, according to Chinese state media. They are using shovels and bare hands.\nFurther exacerbating the situation is the weather: temperatures are freezing, and meteorologists predict sleet and wind to come within the next few days. Many people were forced to sleep outdoors, protecting themselves from the cold in blankets, or spending the night in vehicles.\nPierre Deve for the non-governmental organisation Snowland Service Group, was present in Yushu. He described the damage to Times Online, saying: \"There are corpses everywhere on the street. They don\u2019t have time to deal with them. There is a real need for medicine, for food, for water and for doctors. People are terrified that there will be another earthquake. They are also afraid that a dam that has been cracked will burst and flood the town.\"\nA local doctor, Karma Sherab, also commented on the problems the area is facing: \"Most of the hospitals have collapsed and others had become dangerous. The only thing we can do is to clean the wounds in a simple way or simply amputate instead of curing.\"\n'Huge calamity'; leaders respond.\nChinese president Hu Jintao, meanwhile, said that he would be dispatching over 5,000 rescuers and soldiers to the scene of the disaster; the government has pledged over US$29 million worth of aid. Hu described the quake as being a \"huge calamity\". He is also shortening his visit to a summit in Brazil to return to his country. \"That is why I decided to bring forward my return to China,\" he said from Brasilia.\nPremier Wen Jiabao has visited Yushu to oversee relief work; he decided to delay a visit to southeastern Asia due to the disaster. \"As long as there is the slightest hope, we will make efforts that are 100-fold. Your disaster is our disaster, your suffering is our suffering.\"\nThe head of China's disaster relief department, Zou Ming, says that 120,000 articles of clothing, 120,000 quilts, food, and close to 40,000 tents were to be sent to the disaster zone; he encouraged people to donate money to assist in longer-term relief work.\nMeanwhile, some foreign countries have offered financial help; among them is Japan, which has pledged over one million dollars to disaster victims. The United States also said it is \"ready to assist\" if China requests international aid."}

The grounding was even more extensive than that following the September 11 attacks of 2001 when only trans-Atlantic flights were canceled.\nEurocontrol released a statement saying \"...most air traffic in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Denmark, Norway and Sweden is suspended.\"\nThe grounding is because the volcanic ash drawn into the jet stream is of a particle size which allows it to remain aloft in the atmosphere. Ingestion of this foreign matter, because of its distribution, would lead to flame outs in all aircraft engines. The composition of the ash also means that it would first melt into glass if it were to enter the engine of an aircraft before solidifying again as it cooled. This could lead to damage to the compressors and fan blades, which would make it impossible to restart the engines, even if the aircraft were to exit the cloud. \nThe current contingency is informed by the experience of British Airways Flight 9, which on June 24, 1982 suffered just such complete engine flame outs when it flew through the plume of Mount Galunggung in Indonesia. In that case, the flight crew after many efforts was able to restart the engines, though one failed shortly after, and the aircraft landed without casualties.\nThe UK National Air Traffic Services (NATS) has stated that \"restrictions will remain in place in UK controlled airspace until 1300 (UK time) tomorrow, Friday 16 April, at the earliest,\" and that \"We will review further Met Office information and at 0230 (UK time) tomorrow we will advise the arrangements that will be in place through to 1800 (UK time) tomorrow.\" The NATS statement concluded \"...the situation cannot be said to be improving\". \nIn addition to Northern Europe, the ash is drifting south; Berlin and Hamburg airports in Germany are closed, and airports in the Netherlands, Belgium and Northern France are described as now being closed or closing. Some flights from Spain and Portugal, together with upwards of 4,000 flights across Northern Europe, have been affected, and the knock-on effect of aircraft and crews out of position could disrupt air travel worldwide for up to 72 hours.\nOne affected group are British musicians booked to play at this weekend's Coachella Festival in California. Amongst those stranded are Frightened Rabbit, Gary Numan, The Cribs and Bad Lieutenant."}

With the additional funding, NASA would extend the life of the International Space Station (ISS) by four years further, to at least 2020, design a new series of heavy-lift rockets by 2015, and continue development of the crew capsule, a major part of the Constellation program. Initially, the capsule would serve only as a rescue vehicle for the ISS, but would later serve as the \"technological foundation for advanced spacecraft to be used in future deep space missions.\" The proposed project would also retain plans for private operators to service the ISS, despite criticism that such operators were not reliable enough for the task.\nThe centerpiece of the plan would be manned missions to the moon and beyond, beginning with missions to asteroids around 2025, with missions to Mars following within a decade. Initially, Mars missions would consist of sending humans to orbit Mars, with missions to land on the surface of the planet coming shortly after. Obama said that under the plan, \"we will push the boundaries not only of where we can go but what we can do.\"\nObama said that under his new plan, NASA would be able to achieve more in a shorter amount of time than it would have under the Constellation Program. He also said that, contrary to fears that changes in NASA would result in job losses in Florida, where most space missions are launched from, under his new plan, a total of 2,500 jobs would be created in the area.\nThe new plan would, according to Obama, lead to \"major breakthroughs\" in the US space program. He said that the goal of the new program would be \"no longer just a destination to reach. Our goal is the capacity for people to work and learn, operate and live safely beyond the Earth for extended periods of time, ultimately in ways that are more sustainable and even indefinite.\" The president also emphasized the need for continued innovation, saying that \"we\u2019ve got to do it [space exploration] in a smart way and we can\u2019t just keep on doing the same old things we\u2019ve been doing and thinking that\u2019s going to get us where we want to go.\""}

(As an aside, during Campaign 2000, I told CBS News in Monterey, that: \u201cTo heal the country, we have to heal the family.\u201d After working in the chemical dependency field for about eight years, I felt a spiritual prompting \u2013 as other people at times feel spiritual promptings to do any number of things \u2013 to leave this profession and go out on the road to look for people trying to make a difference when it came to things like healing the family, saving the environment, helping the poor, creating peace ...I felt compelled to gather these stories, using my journalism background, then share them with others \u2013 with the hopes of planting \u201cseeds of change.\u201d After a long, considered discernment process, I decided to go on the road and left Cleveland, in 1990. This was the start of an eight-year research period where I logged close to 100,000 miles. What I learned was a lot of tremendously creative, common sense solutions to practically all the issues of our day. Armed with this, I started to running for president in 1999, and have been doing it ever since (four successive election cycles). In each newspaper interview, each radio show, each speech... I share parts of what I researched with the hopes people will try some of it in their own town, and who knows how far out it will ripple from there. (I found that running for president is a great way to get a message out. And yes, I am indeed trying to win as well. Then I could get the information out a lot quicker, and further.) Now as far as the house painting, because I'm on the road some six to eight months a year campaigning, it's logistically quite hard to hold down a counseling or journalism job. So, instead, I do some part-time house painting to make ends meet. And thus, \u201cJoe the painter.\u201d Note: As an example, in the heart of Buffalo, I interviewed Dr. Myron Glick who felt his own 'spiritual prompting' to move his family to inner city Buffalo and start the Jericho Road Health Clinic. He uses a minimal sliding fee scale and has seen people from at least 50 different countries (Buffalo is a port city). Why? Because he's Christian, he told me, and it is Jesus Christ' edict that we help the poor. I have shared Dr. Glick's story all over the country, with the hopes of inspiring other doctors to consider doing some version of the same. And each time that happens, I get a component of our healthcare bill passed \u2013 and another little kid living below the poverty line gets the medical help they might have otherwise not gotten. For more on our healthcare position paper, see or, listen to my \u201cFireside Podcast\u201d on healthcare, and podcasts on other pressing issues of the day, at \nWhen you announced your candidacy following the 2008 election, you remarked that this would be your final run. Why did you make that decision, and why did you announce your candidacy so early in the electoral process?\nGiven the strategy about using running for president as a way of getting a message out to help change America now, I always announce early and start hitting the road often just as early. For instance, I was just on the front page of the LaGrange (GA) News talking about a project we'd researched (the Alterna Project) to provide long-term, affordable housing for new Hispanic immigrants in a community setting. Now if I had walked in the doors of that newspaper, approached an editor and said: \u201cHi. I'm Joe from Cleveland and I have some great ideas I'd like to share with you.\u201d He/she would have looked at me, not like I was from Cleveland, but rather like I was from, oh, Mars... Also being on the road early, gives me that much more time to continue my cross country research for our position papers, and such. And it gives me more time to, well, campaign in general. When you're short on Lear Jets and have to travel in a 1984 family camper, it just takes you a bit more time to get around. \u201cAmerica is a lot bigger than it looks on the map,\u201d I often joke. And as far as this being our final run... we're planning on winning this time. Although it just occurred to me that when I win this time, I'll have to run again for a second term. They don't call me \u201caverage Joe\u201d for nothing. (My wife Liz says I\u2019m sometimes a bit short on forward planning.) For more about Liz . \nBack in 2000, Steve Chawkins with \"Ventura County News\", wrote to you \"You won't win, you won't be president.\" Why do you believe you lost that particular election as well as the 2004 and 2008 elections? What have you done differently during this run?\nWhy I didn't win in 2000, 2004 and 2008? I didn't get enough votes. (Sorry.) Actually, each election I have been somewhat quietly, and under-the-radar, going about meeting with people on the ground, giving talks, doing local media, putting up fliers...We do all the things the other campaigns do, only with a much smaller budget. I recently told the Sun News in Lakewood, that this, indeed, is \u201c...a serious attempt by an average citizen to run for president.\u201d Yet as for the current state of election dynamics in America, we're up against this huge Goliath(s), and our 'sling shot and stone' \u2013 if one allows that metaphor \u2013 will be sparking a grassroots revolution. But for this to happen, and for this to become a national story with staying power (and not a 15-minutes-of-fame national media blip), people would have to know that there has been tremendous depth and breadth to the research and campaigning. (As just another example, I have traveled more than 80,000 miles campaigning in the past 11 years. And I might well be the most well traveled presidential candidate (domestic road miles) -- in the history of U.S. politics.) So as to what we'll do different in this election? Not much. I intend to stick to our \u201cback road to the White House\u201d strategy , continuing to go from town to town \u2013 waiting for that long caravan \u2013 both literally and metaphorically \u2013 to start lining up behind us. \nIn some sources it says you are running for the Green Party nomination, while in others it says you are running as an Independent. Let's clear this up, are you running for any particular party's nomination, or as an Independent?\nI have primarily run as an independent candidate during these four election cycles. And I am currently running as an independent candidate now. However, in 2007 I vied for the presidential nomination with the Green Party. I didn't get their nomination, yet I continued to run in the 2008 election as an independent candidate. For campaign 2012, I might vie for the Green Party nomination again, once their Primary process starts. Or, and this is another possibility, there has been some talk over the years of a \u201cfusion candidacy\u201d among Third Parties. That is, say, the Constitution Party, the Green Party, the Libertarian Party... would all get behind a single presidential candidate to increase the chances of a Third Party candidate winning. If this evolves, I would consider vying for that kind of candidacy as well. Running with a Party increases your chances of getting ballot access exponentially.\nHow large is your campaign?\nIn comparison to the size of most major two Party campaigns, I once told a network news show in Indianapolis, in response to a similar question about our size: \u201cThink the movie \"Hoosiers\".\u201d This, by the way, played well in Indiana.\nHas your campaign received any notable endorsements?\nBill Samuels, president of the organization Consistent Life, has personally endorsed us in several campaigns. (Consistent Life embodies valuing the sanctity of life at all stages from the \u201cwomb to the tomb\u201d and is a network uniting organizations and individuals who support a consistent life ethic. Their issues revolve around improving a spectrum of issues from poverty, to healthcare, to abortion, to global warming... and anything else that has the potential to end life prematurely.) \u201c[Schriner] is a Christian who is running as a consistent life ethic candidate. He is right on all the life issues on which Obama is wrong,\u201d Samuel wrote in 2008\u2026 Then there have been the media endorsements. Some examples: \u201c...he (Schriner) seems to make a lot more sense than most politicians I try not to listen to.\u201d Steve Zender, editor, The Progressor-Times newspaper, Carey. \u201cIsn't our generation ready to truly make our world better? The first step? Vote for Joe!\u201d Leah Beth Bryson, columnist for The Vision student newspaper, Lambuth University. \u201cA lot of what Joe says really would come across as good, common sense to many Americans. They would gladly have someone like him leading the country...\u201d --editor David Green, The Observer, Morenci. Then there have been all the 'average Joe' endorsements \u2013 'notable' to us \u2013 from around the U.S. The following are a smattering of excerpts from a few of these comments (which came in e-mails and letters): \u201cJust wanted you to know that I'm really impressed with all the research on a variety of local initiatives Mr. Schriner has done. I was looking for a candidate I could actually support, and I found one here.\u201d --Iowa. \u201cI had been searching for a candidate with a consistent life ethic, a commitment to actively working for peace and justice, and concern for the environment... I will happily support you at the voting booth today.\u201d \u2013 Washington. \u201cI was tired of not voting for someone, but rather against the other main candidate.\u201d --Ohio \u201cMy conscience will be clear when I leave the voting booth... and I approve of this message.\u201d --Georgia. And from more short media takes on the campaign\u2026 \nDescribe to me an average day in the life of Joe Schriner. How do you spend your time?\nWhen I'm on the road campaigning, my day looks something like this. (Incidentally, we often move from town to town daily, where versions of this template repeat over, and over, and...). First, we generally get up early and either go to Mass, or do family prayer. Then after breakfast (often oatmeal), Liz starts to do homeschooling \u2013 or as we colloquially refer to it: \u201cmotor-home schooling\u201d \u2013 with our three children. Meanwhile I'll go, often unannounced, to a local newspaper (radio stations, TV stations...) and inform them about a corner whistle-stop event we'll be doing at noon in their town. Sometimes they'll have me stay to do an interview right then, other times they'll send a reporter to the event. Around 10:30 a.m., we'll go to a local library where Liz will continue with the homeschooling and I'll update our campaign website blog about the events of the day before. Shortly before noon, we'll arrive at the downtown venue where we'll unfurl banners, flags and go into \u201cstreet corner whistle-stop mode.\u201d We'll wave and call out to passing motorists, the kids and I will walk about passing out fliers, our young Jonathan will try to get passing truck drivers to honk... It's all rather festive. Afterward we do media interviews, then head out to lunch at Taco Bell, or wherever. After some Dollar Menu bean burritos, we'll take the kids to a park or local YMCA where we all exercise a bit. Afterward, a variety of things might happen. Sometimes we go door-to-door in a town passing out fliers and putting them up in downtown businesses as well. Other times, there's a brief window of time in the late afternoon, and early evening, to write the speech for an event we're doing later that night. Other times we'll take the kids to, say, a Little League ballgame early in the evening. And as they watch the game, I go about passing out campaign literature and talking with folks. Other evenings, we're meeting with supporters in their homes, or I'm out doing research on one of the projects we've come across, or for that matter, I'm sometimes out throwing the football around with the boys... Then, as the evening starts to wind down, we'll look for somewhere to park \u2013 whether a campground, church parking lot, Wal-Mart parking lot... And as the kids settle in, we tell \u201cstories from the road,\u201d or read the kids a book, or the kids will draw, write letters, do Lego stuff on their own... We then say evening prayers together as a family before the kids go to sleep. And finally, Liz and I will often stay up late playing Scrabble, or talking about the day, or working on the scheduling and itinerary for the next several stops. Or some nights, after a day of, well, too close quarters with the kids, Liz and I will simply sit and stare out the camper windows, in silence. Silence that is only occasionally broken by an exhausted Liz, or an exhausted me, repeating the refrain: \u201cI think we need a staff.\u201d\nIf you had complete power at this moment, what would you do? How would you change America?\nIf this means complete power, as opposed to having to deal with the checks and balances built into our federal government, this is some of what I'd do: I'd end abortion and all the precipitating factors leading to it (poverty, dysfunctional family dynamics, relaxed sexual mores, alcohol and drug addiction...). I'd mobilize a set of dramatic initiatives to, not just curb global warming, but to actually start to reverse it. I would unilaterally disarm our nuclear weapons. I'd stop the production of nuclear energy. (Anybody hear of Chernobyl?) I would grant amnesty and family reunification to illegal immigrants. (During a talk at an immigration rally in Arizona several years ago, I said we walked through the slums of Juarez, where violence is off the charts and many of the children are extremely hungry. If I was their parent, I'd do everything I could to get these children out of harms way and get them something to eat \u2013 even if it meant risking crossing the border illegally.) I would end the death penalty. Also in Arizona, I read a newspaper story about a death penalty protester who posed: \u201cWhy do we kill people who kill people to show that killing people is wrong?\u201d Good question. I would increase, exponentially, American foreign aid (it is currently only 4% of the budget) to try to help stem world hunger much more \u2013 24,000 people starve to death every day in the world \u2013 and to help realize Habitat for Humanity's goal of providing adequate housing, (\u201c\u2026for every person in the world.\u201d) I would bring peace to urban war zones around the country. (In part of this effort, our family moved into a dangerous part of Cleveland, Ohio, to be part of the solution.) I would end homelessness. (We take homeless people into our home. And we will be doing the same in the West Wing. I mean the Lincoln bedroom is free, as an example.) I would tremendously jack down and simplify the economy, shifting America back to much more of a local production for local consumption orientation, like it was in the \u201cold days.\u201d I would mobilize efforts for a tremendous come back of the small family farm and the practice of growing organically. This was once the backbone of our country, I told the newspaper Country Today in Wisconsin. And it should be again. I would get people to tighten their belts and pay off the National Debt so our children don't inherit it. During a talk at the University of Notre Dame recently, I said I would redirect the technical smarts at NASA toward coming up with better water filtration systems, solar panels, wind turbines..., as opposed to working on things like going to space destinations where we: can't breathe the air, there's no gravity and there's no food! \u201cThat might be, oh, a hint God doesn't want us there,\u201d I said. I would give some of the land back to the Native Americans so it's equitable, like it should have been from the beginning. And I would give the African Americans tangible reparations for past atrocities and the ongoing trans-generational problems slavery caused. And, I would ensure \u2013 as impossible as this seems \u2013 that the Cleveland Browns had a winning season, soon... For a look at how I would actually try to make a lot of this happen, the Cleveland Browns notwithstanding, go to my rather extensive position papers at \nWhen you say \"we are left of the Green Party,\u201d does that mean you view yourself as a socialist?\nNo, I'm not a socialist. In the article you allude to, I made that comment (as I often do) in relationship to being \u201cleft of the Green Party\u201d when it comes to the environment. And that's hard to do. If fact, I told the Freemont Messenger newspaper in Ohio that when it comes to helping the environment, no Party even comes close to matching the Green Party. I have merely used the 'left of the Green Party' thing to illustrate how serious we are about the environment. During a Third Party presidential candidate debate at the National Press Club in Washington, I said that our family had established a \u201cKyoto Protocol Home Zone.\u201d We don't use air conditioning, cut the thermostat back in the winter, dry clothes on the line, recycle practically everything, live simply with few material items, bicycle or walk practically everywhere within a five-mile radius of our home, use lights sparingly... And at the White House, we'd be doing the same. Not to mention, there would be solar panels and a wind turbine on the White House roof. Our point being that we can't wait for something more tangible than the Copenhagen Accord at this point, but rather the time for each American to voluntarily act on this is: now! Note: We have traveled extensively looking at things like a wind turbine installation in Mandan; a geothermal home installation in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan ($17 heating bill in: January); a Southwest Sustainability Project for retrofitting homes with insulation and alternative energy... And our administration would attempt to move America away from being the leading 'Society of Consumers' in the world, to be the leading 'Society of Conservers.' I mean if we're going to lead, why not lead in the right way \u2013 for our kids and for future generations. At the White Earth Reservation in Minnesota, I interviewed Winona LaDuke. Ms. LaDuke is an Ojibwe Tribe member who ran for vice-president with Ralph Nader in Campaign 2000. She said her tribe believes they are environmentally responsible for the next: seven generations.\nAs a former addictions counselor, would you like to see some prohibitions on the sale of alcohol? Would you consider yourself a member of the temperance movement?\nI would, indeed, be an advocate for temperance (more responsible drinking); but not for a return to prohibition. At the outset, let me draw some parallels to smoking. It was determined that smoking was hazardous to one's health. (Currently more than 160,000 people die of lung cancer each year, as an example.) Then there are other smoking related respiratory issues (like emphysema), and second hand smoke issues, and... In light of all this, anti-smoking campaigns gained incremental traction over the past 50 years. These led to eventually getting cigarette smoking ads banned in many media and created a climate favorable for significantly increased taxes on cigarettes. (President Obama just signed a law increasing federal tax on cigarettes from 32 cents a pack to $1 a pack.) And a wide variety of programs started up to alert youth about the dangers of smoking. As a result of all this, fewer than 20% of adult Americans still smoke, according to a recent Time Magazine article. This figure is down significantly from when the campaign started... Now, while again, I'm not advocating prohibition, common sense says you have to look at the level of drinking in our society at this point \u2013 and how destructive it's becoming. As a former addictions counselor, I did indeed see the destruction alcohol can wreak. It lubricates things like domestic violence between spouses, child abuse, broken families... During our cross country research, I also interviewed Mark West, who started a cutting edge two-year treatment model for recovering alcoholics and addicts in prisons nationwide. He said 80% of prisoners these days have committed crimes under the influence of alcohol or drugs, or were trying to get money for alcohol or drugs when they committed the crime(s). Then there are all the alcohol related traffic fatalities and maiming. Then factor in all those alcoholics who have died of cirrhosis of the liver, or have hemorrhaged to death internally from alcohol addiction, or who have committed suicide under the influence. And add to all this, the number of people in mental institutions with \u201cwet brains\u201d and other mental health complications from alcoholism. In essence, the numbers with all this are staggering. And by comparison, because of the tremendously broad ramifications, alcohol abuse has a much more wide sweeping effect on society than smoking... So, like with cigarettes, our administration would push for things like a significant jump in taxes on alcohol. The higher costs, like with cigarettes, will curtail some drinking. Like with what happened with smoking, we would also push for banning drinking ads in the media (There is currently more money spent on ads for alcohol, than on any other product in America.) Another strategy that we're looking at is proposing: drinking licenses. Seriously. A former bartender in Columbiana County, proposed this to us. For instance, he said just like with getting a driver's license, there should be a written test for a drinking license. It would cover such topics as how many drinks it takes approximately to move one's blood alcohol level over the legal limit in a state. Another set of questions might include identifying the signs and symptoms of alcoholism. In the event of, say, a DWI, or other criminal offense (robbery, domestic violence...) involving alcohol, a person's drinking license could be revoked for a period of time. And if he/she was caught drinking during this time, more penalties would be levied.\nYour Pro-Life stance seems to be a big issue in your campaign. What are your thoughts on Scott Roeder, who assassinated George Tiller? Was this action justified? How far are you willing to go to end abortion?\nI believe abortion is a form of murder. And I told the Range News in Wilcox, that with abortion American society has \u201cbecome its own worst terrorist.\u201d During an abortion, a baby is systematically dismembered in the mother's womb, then suctioned out. I mean, c'mon! Yet even with all this (some 4,000 abortions a day in America now), I don't condone the George Tiller killing. Because, well, it's yet another 'killing.' As I mentioned earlier, I don't believe in the death penalty in any form \u2013 even a pro-life vigilante one. I give talks all over the country explaining that I believe that if pro-life people really want to end this evil, they need to organize \u2013 much better than they are now \u2013 and take to the streets en mass, day in and day out, the same as what was mobilized in the South to end the evil of Segregation. (We've reached the 50 million abortion mark since 1973. That's staggering!)) People should regularly be out with protest signs, not just in front of abortion clinics, but in their neighborhoods. As we've traveled, our family has protested on neighborhood street corners and in front of abortion clinics in California, Michigan, Massachusetts, Ohio, Florida, North Dakota... And we'd be doing the same as the First Family, I told the Lewiston Argus newspaper in Montana.) What's more, the newspapers should be flooded with an avalanche of pro-life letters to the editor. Legislator offices should be deluged with pro-life letters. A lot of people in the South didn't want Segregation to end, but they wanted the protests to end even more. So, eventually, Segregation ended. It could well be the same with abortion. Note: As I mentioned earlier, I would also work stridently to help end precipitating factors (poverty, dysfunctional family dynamics, relaxed sexual mores, alcohol and drug addiction...) that lead to many abortions. As I would work to highlight models for the many crisis pregnancy centers we've researched across the country. Centers that provide food, shelter, clothing, college scholarship money, day care... for moms (and dads) who want to keep their baby. We\u2019ve researched these centers in Minnesota, Indiana, Rhode Island\u2026 For more on our stance on abortion, see: or for a more in-depth paper, see \nWhat are your thoughts on President Obama?\nMixed. Given, for instance, my stance on abortion (last answer), I find Mr. Obama's strong backing of abortion extremely troubling. Conversely, I find his efforts toward scaling back nuclear weapons, cutting down on greenhouse gases, getting more access to healthcare for individuals... as commendable (and in line with the Consistent Life Ethic I espouse). I would, however, push for much stronger action on each of these fronts. (Granted President Obama might have as well in some of these categories, but, as has been the case with healthcare, he has been hamstrung to a degree by Congress.) I do disagree with the president's troop surge strategy in Afghanistan. I believe this will lead to a situation analogous to what essentially devolved into the 'Iraq quagmire.' And I believe the stepped up drone attacks in the mountain region between Pakistan and Afghanistan is a mistake, considering all the civilians being killed. (What we so often refer to as a war's \u201cinevitable collateral damage,\u201d is: children, moms, dads...) Admittedly however, when it comes to both Afghanistan and Iraq, Mr. Obama inherited tremendous dilemmas, with no easy solutions. On the environmental/energy front, I strongly disagree with Mr. Obama's plans for more drilling offshore in the Atlantic, and promoting a new generation of nuclear energy plants... For more on our energy policy, see: In regard to personal characteristics, I do admire Mr. Obama's tenacity, which was demonstrated graphically in the last election process and with his relentless pursuit of the healthcare bill. An addendum: There has been much written about Mr. Obama's oratory skills and negotiating skills. Yet I believe this has to be weighed in the context of: Is he saying the right stuff? Is he negotiating for the right stuff? In my opinion, not always.\nWhat are your thoughts on the Tea Party movement?\nI just recently read a \"Newsweek\" article about the Tea Party. An excerpt that particularly caught my eye was: The Tea Party rejects the idea that \u201c...a government of brainy people can solve thorny problems through complex legislation.\" The Tea Party finds its strongest spirit among conservative Republicans. Yet a powerful current of 'blame both sides' also pulses through the movement.\u201d Lynne Roberts, a volunteer organizer of a Tea Party gathering in Albany, New York said: \u201cWe're equally disgusted with Republican and Democrat Congressmen.\u201d ...The day I was answering this question for this article, I was also interviewed by the Americus (GA) Enterprise newspaper. I said when you objectively step back from society and take a look\u2014we have a mess. We have a $13 trillion National Debt and we are mired in a deep recession. We have just crossed the 50 million abortion threshold. Global warming looms as a scary doomsday scenario. Violence and poverty are almost off the charts in many of our big city urban cores. Our prisons are bursting at the seams. Children are being shot in schools and abducted from the streets\u2026 And one of the main common denominators in this: For the last couple decades, we've had 'brainy' presidents who have come out of Yale or Harvard. So what does this say? I believe it says that, apparently, the education one receives at Yale or Harvard (while impressive to many), isn't the type of education that equips people to, well, solve many of the societal problems I just mentioned. I mean if it was... I told the reporter in Georgia that to solve the National Debt problem, for instance, we need a common sense president \u2013 \u201cwith a calculator that works.\u201d I\u2019m serious. But it's not just the presidents (Congress people, Wall Street bankers, corporate CEOs...), it's us, the American people. We have gotten ourselves into this mess. We're in this global warming crisis, as an example, not because the politicians failed to come up with tangible measures at carbon dioxide reduction in Copenhagen; but rather because many of us are failing here. We drive too much, use too much air conditioning, heat too much, buy too much (it takes the burning of fossil fuels to make the products)... We're a society addicted to comfort and immediate gratification. And what's more, just like an alcoholic, we don't want our politicians confronting us about it. So we elect people who don't confront us \u2013 and the dysfunction (read: destruction) continues. For a candid look at what we propose for global warming, see: and \nWhich historical figure do you most identify with and why?\nGeorge Plimpton. He was a rather famous sports journalist who was known for 'walking a mile in an athlete's shoes.' For instance, he spent a spring training practicing with the Detroit Lions and even played quarterback for several downs during an exhibition game. He then went on to write the book: \"Paper Lion\" from the experience. And that's how I've been, to a degree, as a presidential candidate. That is, I try to live the platform I espouse. For instance, as part of our urban platform, we exhort some people in suburban and small town America to roll up their sleeves and move into the urban cores of LA, Chicago, Minneapolis... to work on systemically changing things.(Just throwing more money and police presence at the problem is like metaphorically putting a band aid on something that needs major surgery.) Taking our own advice \u2013 in a very 'Plimpton-like' manner \u2013 our family moved from Bluffton (pop. 3,857 and think Mayberry) to a hardscrabble part of Cleveland (the poorest big city in the country). We moved into a block where a group of Catholic Workers were living every 3rd or 4th house down from each other. There we all helped transform an old asphalt parking lot into an urban farm, volunteered at a drop-in center for the marginalized up the street; coached Rec. Center soccer and baseball teams (many of the kids not having dads at home) and ... Besides participating in the transformation of this area, like George Plimpton again, I wrote a book about the experience titled America's Best Urban Neighborhood... We also, as another example, promote an agricultural platform that would push for the return of the small family farm, en mass. And as we traveled the country, not only did we research the various dynamics of the family farm, but our family worked on a number of them as well. This included chores like chopping wood, bailing hay, weeding by hoe in an organic bean field\u2026 And these were not 20-minute photo-ops, so to speak. These were long, sweaty days out on the farm. The essence of my candidacy has been \u2018being on the ground\u2019 and working side-by-side with ordinary folks, listening to their thoughts, translating them into positions\u2026 Ours, truly, is an \u2018American peoples\u2019 platform.\u2019 Note: While not a bona-fide historical figure (more fiction, but you wish he was real), I also identify with: Rocky. \u201cSome may feel it\u2019s another Rocky Balboa story about an Ohio man against the millionaires.\u201d -- Alban Mehling, Associated Content\nCould you take this test, and let us know where you stand on the political spectrum?\nOn the test, I scored as a \u201ccentrist.\u201d (Surprised me too.) \nAnything else you want to add?\nAnything else I want to add\u2026 My wife Liz and I are running for president as \u201cconcerned parents from the Midwest.\u201d What we\u2019re concerned about is the alarming increase in climate change, the scary levels of nuclear proliferation (including in this country, even with the new treaty with Russia), mounting violence in our inner cities and stark abject poverty in the Third World. Then there\u2019s astronomical national debt, 4,000 babies being killed in their mothers\u2019 wombs here each day, endless war, terrorism\u2026 During Campaign 2004, I told a newspaper reporter in La Cross, that I didn\u2019t want to be sitting on my death bed someday, staring our children in the eye and saying: \u201cI knew all this stuff was going on, but I was too busy making money.\u201d So our family gave up our normal lives and took to the roads of America to look for solutions to these dilemmas.

We found how to end nuclear proliferation in Luck. We found how to stop terrorism in w:Comers, Georgia. And we found how to realign most of the rest of America in Bluffton (pop. 3,857), \u2018America\u2019s best town.\u2019 and And as these were the most unlikely of places, the people behind the projects were often the most unlikely of people. That is, they were often common sense people with the common good in mind. Not profit. Not fame. Just the common good. We\u2019ve done, maybe, more than 1,000 interviews with these types of people. And from these interviews, as I mentioned before, we\u2019ve developed a solid platform. The best platform out there for where the country needs to go at this point, we believe. You see, in the face of all the pressing problems I describe at the outset of this particular answer, a lot of the current policies seem to me to be \u201crearranging deck chairs on the Titanic.\u201d What we need is leadership at this point that can steer the boat away from the iceberg altogether, and quick. (That is, ironically enough, if there\u2019s going to be any iceberg\u2019s left in the wake of global warming.) Our common sense platform does that, in spades. So Americans have a choice this next election. They can go with yet another Ivy League type choice, contemplating the refrain: \u201cIf you always do what you\u2019ve always done, you\u2019ll always get what you\u2019ve always got.\u201d Or they can go with this quite \u201caverage\u201d family from Cleveland, who will bring good old fashion common sense (think \"Mr. Smith Goes to Washington\") to a White House that will look, oh, a bit different\u2014including perhaps even the color. I mean knowing my wife (soon to be First Lady), she\u2019ll have me painting stuff there on the weekends. I\u2019m thinking about going with, like, a soft green on the outside. --Joe P.S. Don\u2019t let the occasional humor fool you. This is, indeed, a very serious attempt by an average citizen to run for president. And wouldn\u2019t it be refreshing if someone like me won?"}

Although South Korean officials have not said specifically that North Korea is to blame, saying only that the possibility of North Korean involvement is being investigated, analysts and the media in South Korea have been speculating on a possible retaliation from South Korea, although a military response is not expected.\nEarlier this week, the stern section of the ship was recovered from the site of the sinking, and investigators from several countries are examining the wreckage in an effort to determine the cause. Yesterday, a lead investigator said that \"It was highly likely that it was an external, rather than internal, explosion\" that caused the ship to sink.\nThe controversy surrounding the sinking of the ship is likely to reflect poorly on the South Korean government, which has already been criticized as mounting a slow response to the wreck. Before the incident, South Korean President Lee Myung-bak had reportedly been trying to arrange a meeting between officials from the two Koreas, and if signs of North Korean involvement become evident, it could undermine Lee's credibility in South Korea, as he would likely be seen as having left holes in South Korea's defense."}

Authorities fear that the ash can cause vital aircraft parts, such as the engines, to fail in-flight.\nThree large airlines \u2014 KLM, Air France, and Lufthansa \u2014 have already made test flights. Ulrich Schulte-Strathaus, the head of the Association of European Airlines (AEA), commented: \"Verification flights undertaken by several of our airlines have revealed no irregularities at all; this confirms our requirement that other options should be deployed to determine genuine risk.\"\nKLM, meanwhile, said that it will allow three freight planes to make flights to Asia, and had transferred seven passenger planes from Duesseldorf, Germany to Amsterdam, without any travellers.\n\"We observed no irregularities either during the flight or during the initial inspection on the ground. We hope to receive permission as soon as possible after that to start up our operation and to transport our passengers to their destinations.\" said KLM chief executive Peter Hartman.\nACI Europe and the AEA also commented about the issue in a statement: \"While Europe's airlines and airports consider safety to be an absolute priority, they are questioning the proportionality of the flight restrictions currently imposed.\" \"Airlines must be able to fly where it is safe to fly and make decisions accordingly. It is what our passengers demand of us.\"\nAirport closures and cancellations are estimated to be costing airlines about US$200 million daily, the International Air Transport Association reports.\nThe operations control head for Eurocontrol, Brian Flynn, rebuffed notions that aviation officials were being too cautious, describing the issue as an \"unknown phenomenon\". \"With the over-riding objective of protecting the travelling public, these exceptional measures have to be taken,\" he remarked. \"[...] As soon as we are able to, with confidence, and when I say we, I mean the entire community of aviation experts [and] aviation authorities, are able to declare parts of the air space and airports open that will be done.\""}

So we cannot go ahead and just wait until the ash cloud will disappear,\" he said.\nKallas says Monday's meeting will try to find a technological solution to the flight disruption, but he stressed that safety considerations will come first. \"It is clear that safety is our first and utmost priority, so we cannot compromise with safety. But we are working based on new evidence about test flights, how to assess the situation and how to find solutions to increase air space without compromising safety,\" he said.\nSpanish Secretary of State for E.U.

However, Air travel in Southern Europe \u2014 including Spain, southern Italy, Greece, and Turkey \u2014 remains open.\nMeteorologists say conditions over Europe were unstable on Sunday and that shifting winds made air travel dangerous. They also note that the irregular eruptions from the Icelandic volcano, which continues to spew ash into the sky, is adding to the unpredictability of the situation.\nOne expert, Guy Gratton, who is head of the Facility for Airborne Atmospheric Measurements at Cranfield University in the UK, took a flight on Thursday and noted \"It's still quite a complex mixture of clear air and very worrying but invisible volcanic ash at all sorts of heights.\"\nSome of his colleagues made a flight on Sunday and noticed in certain locations, \"quite high concentrations of ash.\" Gratton added, \"I suspect it's going to be a few days yet before it's safe to fly.\" Volcanic ash consists of rock, glass and other particles that can stall aircraft engines. \nKLM said it flew four planes in a normal pattern above 3,000 meters from Amsterdam to Dusseldorf on Sunday. The airline's pilots said they did not encounter residue from the ash cloud and that jetliners were not damaged. Lufthansa flew 10 empty planes from Frankfurt to Munich on Saturday without incident, and Air France flew several successful test flights. British Airways also flew a test flight.\nSome aviation officials have criticized the airline shutdowns, arguing that they were based solely on computer models. Air Berlin chief Joachim Hunold was quoted on Sunday by German media as saying that no one has yet sent weather balloons into the atmosphere to collect data on the volcanic ash.\nAnalysts say airlines are losing about $200 million a day because of the European and trans-Atlantic shutdowns.\nThe last major disruption to European aviation followed the September 11 attacks on the United States almost a decade ago. U.S. airspace was closed for three days and European airlines canceled all trans-Atlantic flights.\nMeanwhile, the British government is considering the possibility of sending in the Royal Navy to help ferry the stranded. Currently, officials are seeing what military and commercial vessels are possibly available to be deployed.\nThe volcano, Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull, in southeastern Iceland began erupting on Wednesday, for the second time in a month, after being dormant for nearly 200 years."}

IATA's chief executive officer, Giovanni Bisignani, said that \"[f]or an industry that lost $9.4bn last year and was forecast to lose a further $2.8bn in 2010, this crisis is devastating.\" He also claimed that the airline industry would require three years to recover from the effects of the crisis, and called on governments to provide some form of compensation to airlines.\nBisignani also criticized the response of European governments to the ash threat, saying that they had over-reacted and the shutdown of all airspace was excessive. He said that \"Airspace was being closed based on theoretical models, not on facts. Test flights by our members showed that the models were wrong.

As of last Friday, organizers have collected only 120,000 of the 279,000 votes needed to bypass the state legislature and have the issue decided on solely by the voters in the November 2 election.\u00a0\nThe current process of redistricting, or redrawing district lines every ten years following the nationwide census, is in the hands of the state legislature, or the . The maps are often drawn by party leaders, allowing incumbent legislators to minimize and discourage opposition in their districts and perpetuate the leading party's dominance statewide.\u00a0\nElection statistics indicate that incumbents are successful in their reelection 98 percent of the time, and that Democrats have dominated legislative elections since they were able to draw the redistricting map in 2001.\u00a0The Democratic Party has successfully reinforced their dominance through \"spoking\", which involves extending districts in Chicago \u2014 a Democratic stronghold \u2014 out into the more Republican-leaning suburbs. In addition to allowing more Chicago residents to become legislators, this method severely weakens the strong Republican presence in the suburbs. Republicans, if given the chance to draw the maps, could overturn this trend by keeping key Republican-leaning suburban and downstate communities intact within their districts.\u00a0\nThe Fair Map Amendment, supported by Republicans and good-government groups such as the League of Women Voters of Illinois, would take the redistricting process out of legislators' hands and instead give that task to an independent, nine-member commission. The amendment would apply to the redistricting of only state legislative districts, not US congressional districts. \u00a0The General Assembly would still have to approve the commission's suggested map, however.\u00a0\nProponents initially aimed to collect the required signatures by April 1, but their inability to do so forced them to push their deadline to last Friday. Even then, organizers were still unable to meet their goal, and they now have until May 3 to send the necessary paperwork to the Illinois Secretary of State's office. \"We're not having so much trouble; it's two weeks before we have to file,\" says\u00a0Jan Czarnik, a member of the League of Women Voters.\u00a0\nCzarnik suggests that the petition low number of signatures is due in part to not having \"enough people circulating petitions in such a short amount of time.\" As Kent Redfield of the Institute of Government and Public Affairs at the University of Illinois\u2013Springfield commented, \"If you've got basically volunteers circulating petitions rather than, say, political parties, people that are normally used to doing this, you're going to have to have a larger margin of error.\" Another possible setback is that public opinion may not carry as much fervor as for other previously proposed amendments.\u00a0\nRepublicans, who hold the minority in the legislature, have proposed the amendment through more conventional means \u2014 via the General Assembly \u2014 but have been unsuccessful. Legislators also have considered other ways to reform the redistricting process. A few Republican party leaders' campaign funds have donated cash to the group organizing the petition, and House Minority Leader Tom Cross has asked the governor to call a special session on legislative redistricting. Some Democrats support the amendment, including Sheila Simon, her party's candidate for Lieutenant Governor.\u00a0\nOther Democrats, however, strongly oppose the proposal. Senator\u00a0Martin Sandoval from Chicago warns that \"Hispanics will not see a proportionate and fair increase in Hispanic-majority districts,\" and the Mexican American Legal Defense &amp; Educational Fund wants assurances that minority rights will not be curtailed.\u00a0"}

The US military presence on the island is seen by some as a legacy of Japan's defeat in World War II by the US.\nJapan's current prime minister, Yukio Hatoyama, pledged to move the base off of Okinawa entirely, and transfer 8,000 military personnel to Guam, superseding a 2006 agreement between the Japanese and American governments to move the base to a less urbanized part of Okinawa. Hatoyama said that he would make a decision about the matter by the end of May, and on Friday told Parliament that he would \"stake his job\" to do so. Opposition leaders in Japan have demanded that Hatoyama should resign as Prime Minister if he does not make a decision by the end of May.\nAccording to media reports, Japanese Foreign Minister had met with U.S. Ambassador last week, and had told Roos that Tokyo was in favor of the most of the 2006 deal, a charge which Okada denied, saying that he had met with Roos, but that no concessions on the matter had been made. The reports inflamed Okinawans, and the mayor of , Okinawa said that the government was \"playing with the Okinawans' feelings.\"\nSupport for Hatoyama's government has fallen sharply in recent months, to 30% approval from 70% late last year, as he has been criticized both in Japan and from the US for his handling of the situation. He has been unable to gain support for alternate sites for the naval base, and has thus far been unable to conduct talks with local officials about the matter. Meanwhile, the US government has pushed for the 2006 agreement to be retained, saying it is the only \"viable\" solution to the controversy."}

They are currently estimated to be releasing around 42,000 gallons of oil a day into the Gulf of Mexico, and the oil slick on the surface of the ocean is estimated to cover an area about 48 by 39 miles at its widest points.

One option would be to install a large dome over the leak and send the collected oil to the surface, where it would be collected by ships. This has been done before, although only in shallow water.

People should be free to enjoy the fruits of their labor and government should be limited to protecting the life, liberty and property of its citizens. That includes such things as national defense, a court system to resolve disputes, and the enforcement mechanisms to enforce contracts between consenting adults and legal entities. A key characteristic of the Libertarian Party is that we do not believe that coercion should be used to effect change. When joining the LP, we take the following oath: \"I certify that I oppose the initiation of force to achieve political or social goals.\"\nOn one of California's major issues today, how do you propose to fix our failing economy?\nWe need to roll-back spending to the level of 1998, adjusted for inflation and population (does anyone think we didn't have enough government in 1998?); lower taxes significantly (especially income and sales taxes); eliminate harmful, useless, and duplicate regulatory agencies; significantly reduce the number of employees at most state agencies; and permanently limit future spending increases based on population and inflation and limited to the tax receipts available (no more deficit spending).\nWe need to roll-back excessive salaries and pensions for state employees and increase the retirement age for both current and future state employees to 65 to 70 (from the current 50 or 55). We need to end collusion between politicians, bureaucrats and government employee unions. No elected or appointed official should ever get a pension or post-employment benefits.\nThe friendly business and low tax environment in California will attract tens of thousands of businesses and millions of jobs to California and, eventually, tax receipts will soar. However, any excess revenue should be used to retire debt or returned to the taxpayers.\nWhat is your stance on gay marriage? \nWhy not just get government out of people\u2019s personal lives? Let people choose how to live their lives, choose with whom they share it, and decide for themselves what arrangements (marriage or otherwise) should be made for all of life\u2019s situations. Treat every individual equally. Do not discriminate in favor of or against married couples (or groups). Let them decide what promises to make to one another and embed those promises in contracts. The state can then enforce the contracts, as it should enforce all contracts between consenting adults. If religions want to put their \u201cstamp of approval\u201d on a wedding, let them; let the people involved decide what to do.\nDo you believe in the legalization of marijuana and why?\nYes. I believe in the legalization of marijuana. The government does not have either the right nor the moral authority to prohibit what substances people put into their bodies for either medicinal or recreational or other purposes. Practically, the war on drugs has been a dismal failure. Just like prohibitions on alcohol, gambling, prostitution, etc., they do not work. They push the activity underground and create opportunities for the criminal element and, likewise, opportunities for the corruption of police and other public officials. Generally, such laws are enforced inconsistently and to the detriment of the most vulnerable individuals in society.\nExplain how you think California's immigration laws should work.\nPhilosophically, I believe in open borders. People should be able to come and go as they please. However, the government should not take money from one group of individuals (taxpayers) and give it to others. We should not subsidize nor penalize immigrants. If people want to come to the United States and California to work and take care of their families, they should be allowed to do so. However, those who commit crimes against persons or property should be either imprisoned (for serious offenses) or deported. In that regard, the United States government needs to monitor and control its borders.\nWhy should California \"permanently roll-back spending to or below the level of 1998... and absolutely limit future spending increases?\" \nOver the past 20-30 years, the state of California has continuously increased the share of the economy that it confiscates through taxes and spends, mostly, on unionized government employees and social welfare. It has reduced the amount of money that benefits the general populace in infrastructure. I chose 1998 because that pre-dates the pension scam perpetrated by Gray Davis, the in the state legislature, and the government employee unions, in which retirement ages were reduced to absurd levels and benefits were increased by about 50%. Were we to roll back spending to 1998 levels, we could both eliminate the state income tax and have a budget surplus. In my opinion, that process was a fraud perpetrated on the taxpayers of California and should be prosecuted criminally. The politicians took bribes in the form of campaign contributions and support and the leaders of the government employee unions paid bribes.\nWhy is it necessary to repeal the global warming laws? \nThere is no global warming crisis. The alleged warming trends do not exist and there has actually been a cooling trend over the last ten or so years. The \"scientists\" who raise the alarm on global warming trends have been discredited as having manipulated their data and destroying data that does not support their beliefs (if they even believe them). Billions of dollars of taxpayer money has been diverted to politically correct scientists and scammers like Al Gore who have gotten rich from this falsehood and who propose to use global warming as an excuse to control mankind's behavior (their real intent). Even if there is some minor global warming (which there has been in some earlier periods in history), there is no reason to believe that it would be harmful to the climate as a whole. Some areas may benefit and some may lose, but that would be true if we had global cooling, too. As an intellectual exercise, ask yourself these questions (originally posed by )\nEven if we can say yes, with some degree of probability, to the first question, the answers to the remaining questions clearly is no.\nWhy should the state remove itself from the education of children? Would you also cut funds for the University of California?\nLike everything the government does, it does a miserable job of educating children and spends way too much doing so. Private competitive schools, perhaps funded by vouchers, would be better. Public school systems have way too many administrators and lack accountability. Teacher unions have the same adverse effect on education that government employee unions have on other government \"services.\" Let's give parents choices by eliminating the monopolistic, union-controlled schools. Competition works and freedom works.\nAs far as the UC [] system, it is a massive overfunded boondoggle. Higher education has been protected from price competition for many decades. The more government subsidizes education, the higher the price charged for that education with the result that the students and their parents end up paying as much as before. The cost of education has increased far faster than inflation over the past several decades. From what I've seen and read, most university professors are grossly underworked. They need to spend more time teaching; there needs to be more innovation in teaching to keep the cost down (like online education, but certainly not limited to that). Many of the services provided to students at our universities are more baby-sitting than education. We need real competition in education and we need to privatize our public universities. Let people keep their tax money and use it to decide where to go to school. I propose we sell the UC system to private owners and let it compete."}

The Coast Guard said it was planning to conduct a flyover of the slick to determine its extent sometime on Friday. According to the National Weather Service, strong winds and thunderstorms are predicted to continue through the weekend, hindering cleanup efforts.\nAlso early on Friday morning, a senior government official, White House advisor , said that the government was immediately banning all new offshore drilling until the investigation into the spill had been completed. His announcement came just after a month the administration relaxed restrictions of offshore drilling. \nThe operation to clean up the spill has accelerated in recent days, with the having joined the effort, as well as resources from the Coast Guard and (BP), the lessor of the rig at the time of the explosion. The total assets deployed in the operation are estimated to be around 1,900 people and more than 300 ships and aircraft. Additionally, six remotely operated submarines are trying to stem the leaks, which now number three, at the ocean's floor.\nOn Wednesday, the estimated amount of oil spilling from the damaged well was raised to 5,000 barrels, or around 210,000 gallons, a day, five times the original estimate of 1,000 barrels a day. This figure was later revised upwards again to 25,000 barrels (1.05 million gallons) per day. So far, the cleanup operation has laid around 210,000 feet of containment booms to protect vulnerable wildlife refuges on the Gulf Coast, and an additional 66,000 feet of boom has been provided by the US Navy. Since the beginning of the operation, more than 18,000 gallons of an oil/water mix have been recovered from the ocean, and after a successful test burn of oil, plans are being made to scale the burns up. According to a BP official, \"We believe we can now scale that up and burn between 500 and 1,000 barrels at a time.\" The first test burned around 100 barrels of oil.\nDespite the efforts, many are still worried about the potential consequences of the spill, and officials said that the damage could end up being more than that caused by the Exxon Valdez oil spill 20 years ago, which spilled 11 million gallons of oil into Alaska's Prince William Sound. One analyst said that he expected \"that movement is going to continue to stress and fatigue the pipe and create more leaks,\" adding that \"this is not on a good trajectory.\"\nBP has developed two options to stop the flow of oil at the source, but both are expected to take at least weeks to complete. The first option is to lower large structures over the leak, which would allow the oil to be safely transported to the surface. BP is building one such structure, but it isn't expected to be completed for at least several weeks. The second option is to drill a second well which would then plug the leak at the source. A well for this purpose will begin to be drilled within two days, although it could be up to three months before the leak is completely plugged."}

The vote was 69\u201347, just two votes short of the 71-vote supermajority needed to propose constitutional amendments for ratification by voters in the next election cycle.\u00a0\nIn the redistricting process, the boundaries of legislative districts are redrawn every ten years following the US census. Districts are redrawn such that they contain constituencies roughly equal in population. During the last three redistricting periods, however, discussions have resulted in deadlock such that the maps were essentially chosen by lottery. Democrats, Republicans, and regular citizens alike have all unsuccessfully attempted to reform that process this year. All constitutional amendments must be proposed by Monday in order to be voted on in a referendum during the election next November.\u00a0\nThe Democratic bill,\u00a0Senate Joint Resolution Constitutional Amendment 121, was sponsored by State Senator\u00a0Kwame Raoul and State Representative\u00a0Barbara Flynn Currie, both from Chicago. The representatives voted mostly on party lines: Democrats hold 70 seats in the House, and 69 of them voted for the amendment. 46 Republicans and one Democrat voted against it. Currie presented the amendment as an improvement because it \"gets rid of the tiebreaker.\" In fact, she argues that the public benefits from giving the job of redistricting to the legislature as a whole, rather than an appointed committee. \"...leaving the decision in the hands of 177 people who are elected by the geographic diversity...is more democratic than giving it instead to the hands of four legislative leaders.\"\nCurrie was referring to the Fair Map Amendment, a citizen-led proposal to create a nine-member commission that would contain no legislators. The party leaders would select eight of the members, however, which Democrats have opposed as intoducing too much bias. Others are against the amendment on the grounds that it does not adequately ensure minority representation.\u00a0\nThe lone Democratic dissenter, Representative Jack Franks from , disagrees. \"I couldn\u2019t get past that because I want to have a system where it\u2019s not legislators choosing their electors, it should be the electors choosing the legislators,\" he said. Even Illinois Governor Pat Quinn was not enthusiastic about the bill and thought it was not \"true reform\".\nRepublicans have introduced the citizen-initiated Fair Map Amendment in the legislature as an alternative and have pushed for its passage.\u00a0The bill was quickly struck down by a Democrat-led committee. At the same time, organizers of the petition drive for the Fair Map Amendment announced that they fell short of the nearly 300,000 signatures needed to bypass the legislature and directly place the question on the ballot.\u00a0"}

In general, I direct and oversee the activities of the USPP. At the moment, my most challenging task is to cultivate state parties across the US. Without them, the national party is essentially insolvent. \nWhat is the Pirate Party?\nThe United States Pirate Party is a relatively new party in the U.S., currently undergoing a revival after having been founded a few years ago. We are similar in nature to the various Pirate Parties found internationally, though we differ somewhat in platform and formation.\nWhat are the goals of the Pirate Party?\nWe are dedicated to protecting Americans' rights to privacy, freedom of information, reforming the patent and copyright systems, and ensuring government transparency. \nWhat are some things you personally want to change about the government?\nThere are a great many things I could bring up in regards to changing in the government, so I'll keep it to my three greatest concerns: Transparency, privacy, and ballot reform. Firstly, transparency is required from our government in all but the most dire situations. President seemed, at first, to be promising in this regard, but again and again since he took office, he has proven that hope to be ill-placed. is hidden from requests, more light is not shed about torture techniques, and numerous bills, most memorably the recent health care reform, are not brought to light for the promised number of days--how is this transparency? \nMy second qualm, privacy, is boiled down very simply--as technology grows, so does the ability to invade the privacy of citizens for the sake of a potential safeguard. This route is far from affective [\"sic\"] in its proposed function. We should take the time to find more effective ways to reduce crime without invading the privacy of law-abiding citizens. Not doing so is to treat each and every American as a criminal without a trial.\nAnd, thirdly, ballot access. While not necessarily a plank of our platform, it is a challenge that the USPP will have to face early on. There is a long standing idea that the United States has two political parties, and that's it, end of story. I can't help but wonder of these people--do you think that the country was founded between these two parties alone? We are a nation of many people, with many ideas and many opinions. To try and simply this to a black and white dichotomy does a disservice to the nation and its people. There are shades of gray.\nHow did you get involved with the party?\nI got involved last fall after hearing of the success of our European counterparts in their elections. I was certain that someone had started a Pirate Party in the U.S., but was surprised that I hadn't heard about it already, so I went looking. And here I am.\nDo you think you have a chance against other parties?\nI have no disillusions about it being difficult, but I am convinced that we have the capability to do so, yes. Furthermore, I welcome the challenge. \nIf you could change anything right this second about the government what would it be?\nI think if I had the opportunity to change anything, it would be one of the three that I covered in question 4. I'm inclined to say ballot access, considering the immediate impact it would have for the USPP and other smaller parties, but transparency and privacy would be close contenders. \nCould you take this test, and let us know where you stand on the political spectrum?\nAfter taking the test, I got a 60%/40%, which put me just inside the zone for a \"Centrist\". Sounds about right. \nAnything else you want to add?\nJust today we launched a new website, as part of our effort to restart the movement in the United States, so I invite all who read this to waltz on over to our website and take a look. Thanks for reading!"}

The party is a member of (SYRIZA).\nTzomakas also sits on his local 5th Athens Municipal District committee, which is a joint effort by left-wing parties including SYRIZA, the and a number of other political parties to oppose austerity measures proposed by the government. All left-wing parties in the country except the (KKE) are involved. Tzomakas explained that the KKE prefers not to co-operate with other radical left-wing groups.\nThe interview comes amid tensions in cash-strapped Greece, where the government is introducing controversial austerity measures to try to ease the nation's debt-problem. An international rescue package has been prepared by European Union member states and the International Monetary Fund \u2013 should Greece require a bailout; protests have been held against government attempts to manage the economic situation.\nInterview.\n How are you doing today?\nWe are coping; we\u2019re looking at numbers and digits and how they're tearing us apart.\nHas slavish pursuit of free-market capitalism been the cause of Europe, and particularly Greece's, economic woes? How, given the , and China being communist in name only, would your vision of a communist system have been better for the majority of citizens?\nGiven current circumstances I think the main goal should be to nationalise means of production and services such as banks but under democratic control by unions and local councils where it effects local economies and re-elect local representatives where needed.\nThere is a necessity for a planned economy but one controlled not by bureaucracy but by the people participating in it.\n For right or for wrong, we have now reached a situation where Greece is on the brink of an international bailout. If you were given power tomorrow, what steps would you take immediately to get Greece back on track?\nWe would immediately nationalise the banks. We would refuse to pay the bonds which were called upon during this time, renationalise privatised industries and invest in such a planned economy.\nBasically, we would refuse to pay debts created by the banks on our government.\n Picking up on your comments about defense expenditure: Is that expenditure a result of a from Turkey, and if so, is this really an issue or a creation of a problem where there isn\u2019t one?\nThere has always been tension between the governments of Greece and Turkey, some created by attempts to cover mistakes by both sides. It is no coincidence that both are in dire straits financially.\nIt is an artificial thing created by [the] government[s]. Of course these things can escalate; both Greece and Turkey have a policy of arms buildup. We recently had the in Turkey where they planned to create incidents within Greece in an effort to seize power.\nAlso, many high-ranking army officers have been prosecuted in Turkey for trying to seize power in a coup.\n Why do you oppose the current austerity measures? What has the government, in your view, got so wrong?\nThe government, in its effort to pay back banks and in fact to pay back interest on loans, has already paid in some cases twice the original loan at high interest rates.\nThey're trying to grab as much money as they can and we know for a fact that\u2019s also on the orders of the Greek capitalist class.\nThey are reducing the worker\u2019s rights for more money and this actually leads to poverty. Greece will be in guaranteed recession for two years and hopes then to create a 0.1% GDP rise. That will be very hard.\nWe know from a variety of statistics that the working class will be made to pay around 35% of the current GDP.\nConsuming will go to standstill so that in two years time debt will rise from 120% of current GDP to 150% GDP and people will suffer. We know all the loans, just like the previous loans, will be siphoned off by business and will not go into Greek coffers. It will go instead to lining the pockets of big business.\n I have heard that people in Greece are upset that the euro has weakened Greece\u2019s economic position, as the \u2019s low value actually encouraged spending by foreigners. What steps would a socialist government take to encourage new spending in Greece by both foreign tourists and investors?\nA socialist government could actually work if other economies and other people would follow Greece\u2019s steps. Greece would then be a self-sufficient economy and not need these investments. Of course we once had these investments, through the tourism industry, and they didn\u2019t work.\nThis is whether with the new currency of the euro or the old. The government is seriously thinking of relapse right now which would be a disaster because it would be so devalued. It would possibly even go into a tailspin of devaluation.\nThe possibilities are grossly underestimated in Greece and not enough investments are made in these possibilities.\nTourism is the main industry in Greece because there is little cost needed in investments, and it doesn\u2019t need a very big infrastructure.\nAny infrastructure that was needed has been left to abandonment by both [the last two] governments, the Panhellenic Socialist Movement and New Democracy. A visitor can see and understand this by the shape ships and ferries are in and the way facilities are lacking.\n How do you respond to the assertion that 'democracy is the least-worst of all the political systems tried'? Would the Greek communists accept a multi-party system where some parties would be stridently advocating free-market economics?\nOne of the difficulties people face when seeking answers about a better political system is the black-and-white approach of ideas and names. True, democracy is a necessary principle, but there are vast differences between e.g. a bourgeoise democracy and a socialist democracy...\nAlso especially in Greece, the term \"communist\" is used by many in the left, it's almost a synonym. The majority of the left would strongly disagree with a one-party model. The leaderships - what erroneously most people call \"communists\" - would probably desire such a system, but no-one would advocate such a demand today. The only political forces that everyone in the left agrees should be banned are those of the ultra-right, with racist and fascist agendas, and this because they stand against the principles of democracy in any case... As we can see however throughout Europe and in history the capitalist system needs such \"allies\" especially in times of crisis. In Greece for instance the ultra-right populist La.O.S [] party has proven itself an invaluable ally of PaSoK [Panhellenic Socialist Movement] in supporting the most vicious anti-labour measures, suppression of workers' rights, even a \"no-questions-asked\" policy of currency depositing that would favor money-laundering for illegal trades such as narcotics or human trafficking. In the mean time it tries to put the blame for the crisis caused by the financial system on scapegoats such as the immigrant and refugee populations.\nIf people had a fair and unbiased view of what a planned economy under democratic control could offer I believe that free-market advocates would be marginalized by the working class internationally, with no call for suppression which can lead to dangerous paths!\n You mentioned in your email to me that the KKE does not co-operate with the rest of the nation\u2019s left-wing community. Why is this? Does this split confuse potential voters about who to support?\nUnfortunately the un-democratic Stalinist traditions and practices of the KKE are deeply-rooted in the Greek CP [Communist party] - one has only to read the analysis of their last congress to see this. Therefore the KKE cannot stand in coalitions as an equal to other opinions. The current leadership of the KKE not only refuses to collaborate with the rest of the left but treats it as a class enemy, on the pretext that (the largest faction in the SYRIZA coalition) voted for the \"\". This became more obvious during the December 2008 uprising where it denounced the youth as \"agent provocateurs that seak to destabilize the country manipulating the masses to violence\" and that SyRizA was \"harboring vandals and criminal elements\", earning shameful congratulations from the government and the far-right. Also the KKE through its union front P.A.ME. refuses to collaborate with other unions in industrial action except general strikes, and then always with separate demonstrations and rallies. This behaviour however has not gone unnoticed by the rank-and-file members, and there is sizable discontent with this hardline approach. The only thing that holds them is traditional strict party discipline and the occasional weaknesses of SyRIzA in terms of less militant, and more reformist positions projected by Synaspismos. In both cases, we expect to see developments that will answer to the indeed-confused public that does not give mass support to the left mostly because of disappointment over sectarianism, lack of militancy and larger demands rather than disagreement on principles."}

This merger will allow Continental and United to surpass the recent Delta and Northwest merger, becoming the largest airline in the world when the merger is finalized.\nThe two airlines failed to reach an agreement on a separate merger several years ago when Continental dropped out of the talks.

This led United to begin merger talks with alliance partner , which also failed to come to fruition. \nThe stock price of both companies rose when news of their merger was announced. Unlike most mergers, this one is relatively even in terms of what each company receives as a result. United Airlines is taking 55% control of the combined company and keeping its name, as well as becoming the main base for the group in Chicago. Continental\u2019s Chief Executive Officer will become the CEO of the combined company, known as United Continental Holdings Inc, and will gain control of the other 45% of the new airline. \nSince base operations are moving to Chicago, the city of Houston recently submitted proposals arguing for not cutting Continental\u2019s over 1,000 jobs in Texas.

After last year's relatively quiet season, with only nine named cyclones, meteorologists are on-guard for increased activity over the upcoming summer and autumn. Hurricane season runs until November 30, and while storms are known to have developed at practically any time of the year, most tend to form within those bounds. The peak of hurricane season is considered to be within the month of September. \nIn 2009, a weather pattern known as in the Pacific Ocean and dust from Africa prevented many storms from developing. However, both of these inhibiting factors are relenting, and waters in some parts of the ocean are abnormally warm. As a result, forecasters are concerned that the 2010 season may be significantly more dangerous, comparing it to previous destructive periods, such as 1969, 1998 and 2005. In an exclusive interview, a \"Wikinews\" reporter talks with hurricane expert Dr. Phil Klotzbach on the upcoming hurricane season.\nInterview.\n Thank you for taking the time to answer some of my questions. How do you feel this year's hurricane season will differ from last year's?\nAt this point, we expect this year will be much more active [than] last year. Last year was only characterized by nine named storms, 3 hurricanes and 2 major hurricanes. Our most recent prediction is that this year will have 15 named storms, 8 hurricanes and 4 major hurricanes. El Nino occurred last year, which increased vertical wind shear in the Atlantic, tearing apart many developing tropical cyclones. The El Nino is currently dissipating, and we expect this season to be characterized by cooler waters in the tropical Pacific, which should reduce vertical shear in the Atlantic and make for a more active season. In addition, tropical Atlantic sea surface temperatures are currently running at near-record levels. Warmer waters provide more fuel for developing tropical cyclones.\n How will the 2010 season compare to seasons like 2005 and 1998, which brought about several catastrophic storms?\nAt this point, we do not expect that 2010 will have as many storms as occurred in 2005, since 2005 was characterized by extraordinary favorable conditions in the tropical Atlantic. We do not necessarily think that the sea level pressures will be as low in the tropical Atlantic in 2010 as they were in 2005. Also, landfalling storms are impossible to predict months in advance. The paths that storms take are governed a lot more by mid-latitude weather patterns, which are not predictable more than a few days in advance.\n Which land areas are at greatest risk over the next several months?\nAs mentioned before, you really cannot say months in advance which areas are more likely to be hit by hurricanes. \n Do you expect an above-average number of hurricane landfalls in addition to a high number of storms? \nMore active tropical cyclone seasons tend to have more landfalling hurricanes, so yes, I would say that the probability of storm landfalls is also increased this year.\n Generally, how accurate are pre-seasons forecasts?\nSeasonal forecasts, like day-to-day weather predictions, become more and more accurate as you get closer to the event that you are trying to predict. The error bars on our current forecast (released in early April), based on our forecasts from 1995-2008 is approximately +-2.8 hurricanes. The error bar shrinks considerably by early June, to approximate +- 2.0 hurricanes.\n How can residents prepare for hurricane season, and when is the best time to stock up on emergency supplies?\nIndividuals along the coastline need to prepare by having an emergency preparedness plan in place prior to the start of the hurricane season. That is, now is the time to prepare for hurricane season! A very helpful resource for developing a plan is located here:\nhttp://www.nhc.noaa.gov/HAW2/english/disaster_prevention.shtml\nThen, if a storm does threaten during the hurricane season, the important thing to do is to listen to local emergency management and follow their advice.\n Finally, is it likely that tropical cyclone activity in other parts of the world will also be on the rise this year?\nWe only issue seasonal forecasts for the Atlantic basin. In general, East Pacific activity tends to go down when Atlantic activity goes up. I don't look much at the Indian and West Pacific Oceans, from a seasonal forecasting perspective, so I cannot say much about what levels of activity can be expected there. "}

The fifteen-month probe began after the performed a water landing when bird strikes damaged both engines in a move dubbed the \"Miracle on the Hudson\" by the media. Nobody was killed.\nThe NTSB's final report, adopted after a board meeting today, concluded that a combination of safety equipment better than the mandatory minimums and good reactions by the crew were the main reasons the 150 passengers and five crew survived. The board stated that the aircraft's equipment met the standards required for \"extended overwater operations\", equipment that was not needed for the January 2009 flight. \nThe aircraft was equiped with escape slides that doubled as water rafts at the front and aft emergency exits, but the aft ones were rendered unavailable. Airbus assumed when designing the aircraft that only one engine would be inoperative during an emergency ditching, and current emergency checklists assume plenty of prior warning for dual-engine failure since the aircraft would be at a high altitude. The A320 was at just 2,700 feet when the incident occurred, having just taken off when it collided with a flock of Canada geese, almost completely removing the engines' ability to generate thrust.\nThe final report has blamed a number of factors for extensive fuselage damage caused in the impact, which cracked a rear bulkhead and caused the aircraft to flood, as well as taking the rear slides out of action. The board said standards aircraft should meet in ditchings \u2014 set by the (FAA) \u2014 were inadequate, training in industry was not sufficient for ditchings and the high level of tasks the crew had to focus on made it difficult for the pilot to maintain his airspeed. The pilot's decision to ditch was credited as being the best possible solution to the emergency.\nThe NTSB noted that while the rear rafts failed, 64 people climbed into the forward rafts, and said many of these people would have been immersed in the frigid river. The board claimed that this could induce \"cold shock\", which can lead to drowning within minutes.\nThe report found that the good visibility, calm water, nearby ferries which provided rescues within twenty minutes and good , allowing the crew to maintain control, were further factors that contributed to the survival of those on board. However, it also found that \"more creative and effective methods of conveying safety information to passengers\" are required after learning that most passengers had not paid attention to the in-flight safety announcement. It also noted that many passengers had difficulty putting on the life vests supplied under the seats.\nThe report further stated that the accident was hard to predict due to the fact that bird strikes tend to occur much lower, usually below 500 feet. It considered the possibilities of fitting engine screens or redesigning engines to mitigate bird strike risk, but these proposals were rejected after consideration since they were deemed unfeasable. \nNTSB Chairman Deborah A.P. Hersman described the circumstances as \"a great example of the professionalism of the crewmembers, air traffic controllers and emergency responders who all played a role in preserving the safety of everyone aboard.\" She further discussed the safety recommendations the report will contain when it is released. \"I believe the safety recommendations that have come out of this investigation have an extraordinary origin - a very serious accident in which everyone survived. Even in an accident where everyone survives, there are lessons learned and areas that could use improvement. Our report today takes these lessons learned so that, if our recommendations are implemented, every passenger and crewmember may have the opportunity to benefit from the advances in safety.\" A total of 35 recommendations have been made seeking improved checklists for emergencies, better certification standards for aircraft and their engines, advances in crew training, better safety equipment and improved safety briefings to passengers.\nOne result of these findings is that the board will likely ask the FAA to require emergency equipment for water landings on all commercial aircraft. The FAA has until now held that such a move would place a disproportionately high cost on airlines."}

In addition to meeting the first minister, Cameron also met with the sixteen Conservatives currently sitting in the devolved Scottish Parliament. \nAfter the meeting, both Salmond and Cameron agreed that the conversation had been \"positive and constructive\" and Cameron pledged a mutual \"respect agenda\" which would see him address the devolved Scottish parliament every year if invited and, in return, MSPs would appear before Commons committees in Westminster. \nCameron outlined part of his spending plans in preparation for an emergency budget, scheduled for fifty days after the election. He announced that no cuts would be made to the \u00a330\u00a0billion annual budget for Scotland though that \u00a36\u00a0billion in spending cuts would have to be made\u2014 something likely to cause controversy in Cameron's coalition government. However, both Cameron and Salmond anticipate that cuts may need to be made in subsequent years.\nAt a conference, Salmond said the talks had been \"positive, constructive, detailed and substantive. I prefer a 'respect agenda' to a 'disrespect agenda'.\" He added that \"[h]ow we judge the outcome of that agenda will be based on the policy options the Westminster government pursues, not just the words\".

A process likened to the of a computer with a new operating system.\nVenter's achievement has been dismissed by some as falling short of a true technological breakthrough, claiming that rather than creating a new genome, that he has merely recreated the genome of an existing bacterium: \"a technical tour de force\" but not breakthrough science, according to Caltech geneticist .\nAmongst the possibilities of artificial bacteria talked about are bacteria tailored to solve climate change by taking out of the atmosphere and to develop new vaccines.

The response is believed to be caused in part by the two current oil spill disasters (that of the Deepwater Horizon Incident and more recently the Alaska oil pipeline malfunction). However, Begich is not happy about the actions taken by the White House. \n\"I am frustrated that this decision by the Obama administration to halt offshore development for a year will cause more delays and higher costs for domestic oil and gas production to meet the nation's energy needs,\" Begich claims.\nLast September, the state of Alaska made a public notice about Shell's desire to drill off the coast of the , placing experimental drilling rigs at two drill site location: \"Torpedo\" and \"Sivulliq\".\n\"Shell is committed to undertaking a safe and environmentally responsible exploration program in the Chukchi Sea and Beaufort Sea in 2010,\" said President Marvin E.

The potential for loss in the Arctic is great.\"\nOdum believes that the climate in the arctic will make any spill easier to clean up because, \"Arctic conditions create differences in responding to oil in cold and ice conditions. Differences in evaporation rates, viscosity and weathering provide greater opportunities to recover oil. In Arctic conditions, ice can aid oil spill response by slowing oil weathering, dampening waves, preventing oil from spreading over large distances, and allowing more time to respond.\"\nHowever, Clausen believes that there are no current systems to remove oil from icy ocean waters. \nThis is not the first time that President Obama's administration has taken the environmentally cautious path in Alaska. The President put off limits to oil and gas exploration until 2017. Bristol Bay currently is one of the top salmon fishing grounds in the state.\nInterior Secretary is expected to give a speech at Thursday's address, regarding the suspension of Arctic oil drilling projects.
