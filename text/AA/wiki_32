Rebels claimed to have held off government troops in both cities, though dozens of people are reported dead in the latest violence.\nControl of Ajdabiya has reportedly shifted between government and rebel troops in the past two days. Government forces apparently captured the city during the day on Tuesday, but retreated by evening. On Wednesday, the city was under attack by airplanes, tanks and mortars. At the end of the day, the rebels still appeared to control much of the city.\nAccording to a doctor in the city, at least 26 people have died in Ajdabiya in the past two days. On Tuesday, Libyan state TV reported that Ajdabiya was \"totally controlled and is being cleansed of armed gangs.\" However, a rebel official later said that \"[t]here's heavy, sustained tank shelling and earlier there were air strikes, but now the revolutionaries managed to take seven tanks from those dogs and, God willing, we will succeed.\"\nRebel leaders also claimed that warplanes and a helicopter under their command had been involved in the fighting, and said they had superior weapons than government forces. Outside the city, however, government forces were reported to be amassing several hundred troops, as well as increasing supplies of ammunition and weaponry.\nIn Misrata, rebels claim that they had repelled government forces using tanks and other artillery weapons, though this could not be confirmed. Eleven people are reported to have died on Wednesday in Misrata.\nInternational diplomatic efforts to resolve the situation continue. French president Nicolas Sarkozy wrote to the UN Security Council in support of a proposed resolution that includes the establishment of a no-fly zone in Libya. The international community is still split on the idea of military intervention, though; while the supports a no-fly zone, a G8 meeting on Tuesday ended without support for the idea."}

These pools are believed to be almost empty; if they run out of water the fuel rods can melt and release high levels of radiation. The storage pools have a capacity of about 2,000 tonnes of water, a third of that is needed to keep fuel rods submerged. Each helicopter can carry 7.5 tonnes of water at a time.\nTV footage showed helicopters dropping water from about 300 feet above the reactors. Some time after the helicopters began to drop water, military trucks started using a water cannon to spray reactor three.\nThe crisis at the power plant has led to the evacuation of around 70,000 people who lived within 20 kilometres of the plant, while another 140,000 are under orders to stay inside. The United States has asked its citizens who are within 80 kilometres of the plant to leave."}

He was today sentenced to twenty concurrent life terms.\nMogale's crimes lasted a year from March 2008 to March 2009, coming to an end when police were passed his car's number plate information following a teen's disappearance. He was arrested shortly after the killing of a prostitute he had hired; he was found to have a phone stolen from another victim when he was detained.\nWhilst the killer was still at-large police named him after the West-End factory, a building materials factory in Waterworks, around which most of the attacks were centred. Other victims were attacked in .\nJudge Frans Kgomo also chose to convict Mogale, who is in his forties, of three aggravated robberies, , assault with intent to cause , theft or fraud and escaping lawful custody. He cleared the defendant, who took victims to open areas before comitting sexual murders, of nine other charges.\n41 witnesses testified for the prosecution, including the only two women to survive. Both told the court he had introduced himself as a preacher and prophet. He wore a Christian Zion badge and , which both victims identified; were also submitted as evidence. The accused's distinctive facial scar was recognised by the survivors.\nThe first described his help for a ailment; she said he claimed he needed to have sex with her to exorcise a spirit from her and placed herbs in her vagina, but Mogale countered that they had consensual intercourse as part of an affair. The second said he took her to a veld and attacked her after giving her a lift, knocking her unconscious. Upon awakening the following day she said she had maggot-infested wounds and a dislocated jaw. Her genitals and neck were wounded; her front teeth were missing.\nMost of the bodies were badly decomposed when they were found. They had mostly been killed by to the skull, either with a weapon or hitting their heads against the ground, although some were strangled. Two women were . DNA and mobile phone records linked him to the crimes. He originally confessed to police.\n\"I want you to help me,\" he told officers after his arrest. \"When I am with a woman I lose control and do not know what to do. I kill all of them when they do not give me what I want.\"\nMogale's defence centred on accusations the witnesses - amongst them his partner, Charlotte Manaka - and police were trying to frame him. He said police took a condom used by he and Manaka to obtain forensic evidence to plant. Manaka directly contradicted this in her testimony, saying they did not use condoms, as well as saying Mogale regularly wore the beads and badge identified by victims. The couple have four children.\nJudge Kgomo noted that \"[t]his defence is very suspicious, especially because the DNA kit was compiled long before the accused was even identified as a suspect and long before he was arrested,\" and that the state witnesses were important to the case. \"The accused was not a very good witness... with his contradictions and new versions... at times he wanted to shift blame onto his defence counsel.\" The judge felt \"he was not telling the whole truth\" and criticised his failure to produce witnesses to back up his claims.\nProfessor Gerard Labuschagne, who does investigative psychology for the police, was an important witness. He told the court similarities between the various attacks meant they were \"undoubtedly by the same offender.\" Some of the bodies remain unidentified.\n\"On the day he was arrested, the accused displayed hatred for women,\" said judge Kgomo. \"He behaved like a psychopath, even showing his manhood to the female police officer. When he met the same policewoman at the station he said, \u2018when I come out of here you will be the first person I rape and kill\u2019.\" In summary, Kgomo said, \"[t]he state has proved beyond reasonable doubt the accused\u2019s guilt.\"\n\"I didn't do anything,\" protested Mogale shortly before judgement was handed down. \"You know how life is, this is a challenge, I didn\u2019t do any of those things. I don\u2019t even know those women.\" He has been convicted of rape twice previously.\nAt sentencing today, Judge Kgomo called Mogale an \"evil and perverted murderer and rapist who pose[s] extreme danger to women in society.\" As well as sixteen life terms for the murders, four extra life terms were handed down for raping some women twice. Each of the three aggravated robberies attracted a fifteen-year sentence, each kidnap produced five years, three years for the theft and fraud charge, three for sexual assault, three for escaping custody and five for attempted murder. All the sentences will run concurrently.\n\"Sir, there is no way you can be allowed to be out of prison to come into contact with women,\" Kgomo told Mogale. \"I am removing you permanently from society.\" As Mogale was led away he shouted at the victims' families \"[y]ou are also coming, I pray. I will be out soon.\""}

If this disruption is real, Feng claims that treatments could be developed to correct synaptic function for any defective synaptic protein in an autistic patient. \nFeng continued; \"These findings and the mouse model now allow us to figure out the precise neural circuit defects responsible for these abnormal behaviours, which could lead to novel strategies and targets for developing treatment.\" \nAbout one in 110 children in the U.S., and at least one in 100 in UK, have been diagnosed with an , for which there is currently no effective cure."}

Many political observers believe the couple filed their request so that Torres can stand to succeed her husband when his term ends in September, as the Guatemalan constitution does not allow close relatives of the president to do so.\nComments on the divorce have ranged from 'unthinkable' to 'a fraud', the latter description by candidate .

It focuses on the period between 500 and 500. The game will be released in two parts: the first covering the pre-AD period, and the second running to 500AD. With development well underway, \"Wikinews\" interviewed the development team.\nAviv Sharon, a 24-year-old Israeli student responsible for the project's PR, compiled the below Q&amp;A, which the full team approved prior to publication.\nInterview.\n Could you introduce the development team of 0 A.D. ?\nWe are Wildfire Games, a group of approximately 15-20 people from around the world developing 0 A.D., a free, open-source game of ancient warfare. Cumulatively, about 100 different people have contributed to 0 A.D. over time. Our ages have ranged from 15 to &gt;65 and our locations range from North America and Europe to India and New Zealand. The contributions to 0 A.D. are coordinated by a team of department heads led by a lead producer, Erik Johansson (feneur), who is 25 years old from Sweden.\n Who are the participants ? Salarieds or benevolents ?\nAll contributions to 0 A.D. so far have been on a voluntary basis only. To speed up development, however, we have decided to raise enough money to support 160 hours of paid development of the 0 A.D. codebase. We have tentatively selected the team member who will receive this compensation, Philip Taylor (Ykkrosh), but decided to hold off for a few months until we start using these funds to wait until he has more time to dedicate to 0 A.D. development. Otherwise, 0 A.D. development will continue to be voluntary, and all funds donated to 0 A.D. will be used for team expenses only, such as website hosting costs.\n Why did you want to make games?\nThere are several different reasons. Originally, 0 A.D. was born out of a desire to innovate within the RTS genre. We felt, and still feel, that this genre has a lot of potential for innovation and we wish to explore that with some different rules. 0 A.D. started out as a total conversion mod for Age of Empires II: The Age of Kings, until team members at that time ran into the limitations of changing a closed-source game. Hence, as a wish to break free from the limitations of other games' engines, the standalone version of 0 A.D. was conceived and its development continues to this day.\nSome other reasons include a deep appreciation of ancient history; the wish to improve our skills and be recognized for our talents; and a determination to prove that a group of volunteers collaborating over the internet can make a game that rivals the commercial, proprietary AAA titles.\n Why did you choose a free license?\nPeople are spending more money, time and attention on playing computer games than ever before, and games are constantly evolving into a more nuanced medium of expression and a greater part of our culture. Just observe how much people play on Facebook and their mobile devices. We think this culture should allow gamers to learn how their games work, change them, share them and redistribute their works. This freedom to tinker is what Free, Open-Source Software (FOSS) is all about and so we hope a lot of people tinker with 0 A.D.\n How do you coordinate ? What technical and financial resources has 0 A.D.?\nWe mostly coordinate over a forum system we have, as well as a Trac system for task management and technical documentation. We also conduct discussions over IRC (#0ad and #0ad-dev on QuakeNet), that get more concentrated on the weekend, and Saturday afternoon in particular, when we have our weekly meeting.\n Which type of participants do you need? 'Amateurs' can they participate?\nAmateurs can definitely help with tasks like documentation and spreading the word about 0 A.D. For other tasks, we do require some prior knowledge in fields such as software development, 3d animation etc. \nOur main personnel needs are in three fields: Programmers, artists and sound people. We have many applicants for sound contributors but need a manager to oversee them. For programming we need capable gameplay, AI, sound and graphics programmers, proficient in C++ and/or JavaScript. Finally, in the art department, we could use some more texture artists, 3D artists, animators, and illustrators to draw 2d icons for the game's user interface.\n It's been 10 years since 0 A.D. is developing, what obstacles have arisen and how have you resolved?\nThe biggest obstacle we have run into is underestimating the scale and complexity of an RTS game. When embarking upon this journey in 2001, nobody thought that completing this endeavor would take this long. Evidently, making an RTS game requires a great deal of programming features, art assets and more. And, as we discovered the hard way, the first draft of anything is seldom good enough. For example, one of the most important engine components, named \"Simulation\", was simply planned wrong the first time around. Simulation is in charge of changing the state of each entity in the \"world\" represented in the game, like handling harvesting resources, doing damage to stuff and handling death. Sadly, over time it got implemented in such a haphazard way it devolved into an unstable, unpredictable ball of mud. Debugging became difficult and attracting new programmers from joining the development effort became impossible. Over time, fewer and fewer developers stayed on with 0 A.D. and it seemed as if the project was in grave danger of ending, the way many initiatives on the internet spontaneously do.\nThankfully, one of our programmers, Philip Taylor (Ykkrosh) from the UK, fixed this situation almost singlehandedly over the course of a few months in 2009-2010. Ever since simulation was fixed, it's been smoother sailing and the pace of development picked up considerably. We have recruited several programmers and are constantly adding new features, most recently a prototype opponent AI, which is a big milestone for us.\n What are you proudest of about your game?\nWe are proud of the way our fans go \"wow\" over screenshots, in-game videos and their direct experiences with the game. We get comments like, \"It's like Empire Earth, Age of Empires, and Rise of Nations had a baby and it came out free!\" and \"This can't be open source. It rocks too much!\". We're proud we've built a community of enthusiasts on our forums, Twitter, Facebook and elsewhere, and continuously generated some buzz around 0 A.D. We hope to justify this hype and lead the project to completion.\n What is the schedule for 2011?\nOne big upcoming feature is random map scripting, which allows for much more variety in gameplay without having to manually draw new maps all the time. Our prototype opponent AI is set to get even smarter at all aspects of gameplay, and, with time, will be able to execute any of a variety of strategies to win the game. However, generally speaking, we don't make long-term plans because they never seem to work out. So far, since August 2010 we have released an alpha version every 70 days on average, and we intend to keep releasing more alpha versions until the game is feature-complete. Then we will enter a beta phase, playtest and fix bugs until a point when we decide the game is done, hopefully sometime in 2012."}

Detroit, once one of the top five U.S. cities in population, has its lowest number of residents since 1910.\nPopulation numbers affect the amount of federal and state funding a city receives. In the last few decades, dozens of Michigan state laws have been passed allowing Detroit, because its population was at least 750,000, special measures to raise revenue and allocating it a larger share of Michigan's state revenue than its population warranted.

In spite of this, twelve of the fifteen north-eastern ports of Japan have recommenced operating, while the majority of the oil terminals of the country remained open, according to Inchcape Shipping Services.\nAmongst the aftermath of the earthquake, plant number 3 at the is suspected to have been damaged and may be releasing radiation. The have reported that an ongoing investigation is occurring to attempt to discover the cause of the radiation leak at the power plant. Chinese authorities have reported two Japanese tourists were found to have levels of radiation \"seriously exceeding limits\" on their clothing and luggage. In Tokyo, the amount of radiation in the supply of water has decreased, however it remains high in various parts of the north of Japan.\nAccording to BBC News Online, two workers were hospitalised because of the leak. (TEPCO), who operate the building, reported that three employees placing electrical cables at the location were given treatment for being exposed to radioactive water; they had experienced ten thousand times the regular amount of radioactivity. Of those three men, beta rays caused two of them to receive burns. The two individuals did not stop working despite meters advising of unsafe radiation levels. It was later discovered that they were wearing inadequate protective footwear and failed to draw their attention to a radiation alert. TEPCO has since received government orders to improve worker management.\nThe radiation emitted from the plant has had a significant effect on the Japanese food industry. In the surrounding areas of the plant, shipments of foodstuffs have been prohibited. In , residents have been advised not to consume eleven leafy green vegetable types produced locally due to radiation concerns. There has also been a significant decrease in customer demand at a fish market in .\nJapanese product importers have discovered some foodstuffs to have a small radiation amount, which is not thought to be potentially deadly. Numerous Asian countries, the European Union, Australia, Russia and the United States have prohibited milk items, seafood and vegetables from being imported from various Japanese prefectures.\nClosing the power plant down may take at least one month to achieve. Speaking to , an individual talking on behalf of TEPCO stated that the company is \"still in the process of assessing the damage at the plant, so that we can't put a deadline on when the cooling operations will work again\". Residents living within thirty kilometres of the plant have been advised to avoid going outdoors to attempt to prevent radiation exposure as far as possible."}

Nishiyama could give no predictions of when work would resume. The possibility that water is leaking from the core of reactor No. 3 increases the danger for workers who attempt to cool the crippled plant. The reactors must be cooled before more safety work can begin. \nJapan had been using seawater for cooling since the disaster crippled the power plant's cooling systems, but U.S. officials were concerned that saltwater could harm the equipment, causing it to seize up and corrode, thereby worsening the situation."}

The trams will be used to supply additional capacity on the network between Elmers End, central Croydon and Therapia Lane \u2014 one of the most congested parts of the route.\nTfL, who purchased the Tramlink network from Tramtrack Croydon Ltd. in 2008, announced the plans late January, after submitting the tender to the \"Official Journal of the European Union\" (OJEU) on January 29. According to the notice, the additional trams will operate approximately 75,000km per year, will be needed for \"at least 10, but not more than 20 years\" and can be either new build or existing vehicles that can be modified \u2014 at a reasonable cost \u2014 to run on the Tramlink infrastructure.\nThe tram fleet is currently made up of 24 trams, which were constructed for the opening of the 28km network between 1998 and 2000. 22 of these trams are currently needed to operate the three tram routes each day, and the new service is expected to require at least an additional five trams daily, bringing about the need for a boost to the fleet levels.\nThe shortlist to supply the trams consists of /, and , and the the three consortia will now be invited to submit proposals to supply the additional trams.

The system has had several set backs since construction began, with the network now set to open in stages with a number of tram lines (but not the trams to operate them) being cancelled, leading to a large surplus of vehicles that could be hired out in the short term. The trams are amongst some of the longest and heaviest in Europe, though, and will require a large amount of modification to enable them to be able to operate on Croydon's network if the bid is successful.\nShortly after the announcement, whilst inspecting one of the network's current trams at East Croydon tram stop, Boris Johnson said: \"I have no greater responsibility as Mayor than to ensure people can move around this city with ease, comfort and reliability.\n\"Trams in Croydon have proved a major success and this is reflected in journey numbers which have soared by 45 per cent since the network opened in 2000.\n\"I look forward to the extra vehicles developing this vital, much-appreciated, and indeed attractive, form of transport further.\"\nFunding for the new trams is expected to largely come from TfL, however the London Borough of Croydon has also confirmed a \u00a33m contribution to the project. This will also include the refurbishment of tram stop surrounds.\n Leader Mike Fisher said: \"This is looking like a great deal for Croydon and shows the benefits of an ambitious local authority and committed Mayor working together, pooling resources and expertise.\n\"There is real support to get additional trams for Croydon to keep pace with growing demand for Tramlink services and also to secure major improvements for pedestrians and transport users around and between East and West Croydon stations.\"\nTfL anticipates that, providing a successful bid is made, the new trams would be delivered to the network's depot at Therapia Lane in late 2011, with an entry into service from early 2012."}

The current plans will now see the vehicles operating along a currently-freight-only line between Rotherham and , before linking up with the existing network there and continuing onto the streets of Sheffield.\nThe plans to use tram-trains \u2014 which are already in widespread use throughout continental Europe, but not at all within the UK \u2014 have come about as an alternative to an original proposal to extend the Supertram network to Rotherham, which would be a much larger expense for the same or even fewer benefits.\nWhilst the journey between Sheffield and Rotherham is already covered by mainline trains, project officials believe that the new service \u2013 running via Meadowhall South and and terminating at Parkgate, with a twenty-minute headway throughout \u2013 will attract extra custom to the intermediate points between the two conurbations, as well as making travel easier for people who find it hard to walk to and from ; the tram-trains will serve the heart of the city-centre.\nNow that the funding for further feasibility work has been approved, , and the (SYPTE) can continue to look at the business and project case for the trial, which will look at a range of issues, including economic and environmental benefits of the tram-trains, and ensuring that the vehicles will be safe to run on both the Supertram network and heavy rail tracks.\nTransport Minister announced the sum, and stressed the Government\u2019s commitment to the scheme: \u201cThere is no doubt about finance being available to deliver the scheme. The Government is committed to a trial of tram-trains in the UK and the route between Sheffield and Rotherham is the best place to develop it.

Speaking about this news, Ashcroft said: \"The loss of high street outlets, the slowdown in physical music sales as well as the challenges capturing the full value of music usage online has meant that for the first time we have seen royalties collected dip. Previously, any reduction from falling physical sales had been offset by our strong performance in music licensing both in the UK and internationally. In 2010 slower growth at home and abroad failed to fully mitigate the decline.\"\nIn 2010, the sales of music physically and digitally grew by 7% to achieve 120 million units. Meanwhile, sales of compact discs fell by 12.4% to a total of 98.5 million. British global entertainment retail chain has attempted to save money by closing down sixty of its shops in the UK. In 2010, royalties' growth reduced in speed to 4.3%.\nSimon Neil, of Scottish group , explained that \"[t]he thing about PRS is for a lot of bands it's the only way you make money. In our first six years of being in a band that was the only kind of income we had. It's the bread and butter for bands. It's almost your only guaranteed source of income.\"\nPRS for Music has stated that its payout to its members was decreased by \u00a3800,000 (US$1,3 million, \u20ac900,000), due to improved society efficiency and a reduction in costs related to administration. According to \"\", the small royalty drop may trigger a larger decline, causing new musical composers and writers to avoid joining the music industry.

It is expected that the concessionary contract will be awarded during the coming summer, with construction starting before the end of the year. The contract will run for 23 years.\nTramlink Nottingham chairman Roger Harrison said: \"Building on Arrow's successful legacy, we are excited to be taking forward the next chapter in Nottingham's tram story.\n\"Our focus now will be on working with Nottingham City Council to ensure NET Phase Two can be introduced at the earliest opportunity.\"\nThe reshuffle of operating consortium means that (NCT) \u2014 the main provider of bus services within Nottingham \u2014 will have no part to play in the extended network, despite the numerous awards and high satisfaction levels NET has had since its opening; it is the only one of Britain's five light rail networks to be an instant success.\n\"We're obviously very disappointed not to be part of the selected preferred consortium. Nottingham's tram has won numerous awards and after seven years passengers continue to praise its operation. We would have relished the opportunity to have been part of this continuing success,\" said NCT's Managing Director Mark Fowles.\nBut the council stresses that they are still committed to the future of the company.\n\"This decision in no way reflects the excellent job Arrow Light Rail Limited has done operating the tram since its launch. Annual customer satisfaction figures remain very high and this is testament to this operation,\" added Jane Todd. \"The decision to appoint a new consortium to build and operate the extended tram network was made on the basis of selecting the best proposal to meet the council's objectives for the future of the tram system. The overall offer from the Tramlink Nottingham consortium was stronger. Although disappointing for NCT it is nonetheless good news for the integration of public transport services that the city's other major bus operator, Trent Barton, is part of the preferred bidder. I am certain NCT will continue to provide award winning bus services for the people of Nottingham.\"\nStaff currently employed by Arrow Light Rail are expected to be transferred over to Tramlink Nottingham around August, when further details of the contract will become clear. Other changes that are proposed for the network include 'smart card' ticketing \u2014 similar to the highly successful scheme that is in use across 's service \u2014 and the phasing out of tram conductors in favour of on-platform ticketing machines. Current conductors will be offered new roles within the company, though talks are still on-going about how to combat any potential fare-dodgers.\nFurthermore, an additional 22 tram vehicles will be built by consortium member Alstom for the extended network, though these will be of a different design to the 15 existing vehicles, which were built by to their design for the system's opening. The new trams will be part of Alstom's family, and will bring the total tram fleet to 37. This will also allow for service frequencies to be increased and for overcrowding to be eased at peak times.\nTicketing arrangements for the network will also change when the new consortium takes over. Currently, combined tickets, cards and passes can be used for the tram and NCT buses, but these are due to be phased out and replaced with the new smart cards in time for the opening of the extensions. Prior to that, passengers will be able to use combined tickets, cards and passes for the tram and Trent Barton buses, in a similar arrangement to that which is already offered for NCT.\nPat Armstrong, director for NET, said: \"The move is very much towards more sophisticated smart ticketing, like the Oyster card in London. You use the same card but the money goes back to the company you are travelling with.\"\nThe extended network, new trams and numerous other changes should be fully operational by the end of 2014, but NET users and tramway enthusiasts had mixed views on the matter:\n\"I think it's a bad idea to phase out the conductors,\" said Andrew Blood, assistant editor of the Tramways Monthly e-magazine, \"Not only do they help with revenue protection, but they are also responsible for the high passenger satisfaction levels on the system. In short, they keep tram users feeling safe.\"\nGreg Smith, from Hucknall, was pleased that service levels were going to increase: \"The fact that the trams will be running more frequently is a massive bonus in my eyes. The service we get at [the Hucknall] end of the line is great already, but if [the trams] are running more frequently it's just another advantage of the system over the bus.\" But he was also wary of on-platform ticketing being brought into place: \"I'm not sure that losing the conductors in favour of ticket machines is the way to go, though.\""}

According to Management Institute of Population and Development consultant Devendra Kothari: \"Our federal government sends funds to the states according to their population. This means that the states that have worked harder to reduce their population growth get less money from New Delhi\". Kothari continued: \"The states with lesser population send fewer members to the Indian parliament. Their financial and political clout will go down.\"\nOver the course of the approaching year, concluding census figures will be publicised, according to officials."}

Around 50 bodies of the 228 passengers and crew on board and parts of the plane were found shortly after the crash in 2009.\nAccording to Jean-Paul Troadec, the head of France's (BEA), the accident investigation body for aircraft overseeing the operation and investigation, the wreckage and bodies will be bought to surface and then sent to France for investigation.

The ACLU and EFF cite First and Fourth amendment issues as overriding reasons to overturn government attempts to keep their investigation secret; and, that with being an Icelandic Parliamentarian, the issue has serious international implications.\nThe case, titled \"In the Matter of the 2703(d) Order Relating to Twitter Accounts: Wikileaks, Rop_G, IOERROR; and BirgittaJ\", has been in the EFF's sights since late last year when they became aware of the US government's attempts to investigate WikiLeaks-related communications using the popular microblogging service.\nCase background.\nThe key objective of this US government investigation is to obtain data for the prosecution of Bradley Manning, alleged to have supplied classified data to WikiLeaks. In addition to Manning's Twitter account, and that of WikiLeaks (@wikileaks), the following three accounts are subject to the order: @ioerror, @birgittaj, and @rop_g. These, respectively, belong to Jacob Apelbaum, Birgitta Jonsdottir, and .\nBirgitta is not the only non-US citizen with their Twitter account targeted by the US Government; Gonggrijp, a Dutch 'ex-hacker'-turned-security-expert, was one of the founders of \u2013 the first in the Netherlands available to the public. He has worked on a mobile phone that can encrypt conversations, and proven that electronic voting systems can readily be hacked.\nIn early March, a Virginia magistrate judge ruled that the government could have the sought records, and neither the targeted users, or the public, could see documents submitted to justify data being passed to the government. The data sought is as follows:\nThe order demands disclosure of absolutely all such data from November 1, 2009 for the targeted accounts.\nThe ACLU and EFF are not only challenging this, but demanding that all submissions made by the US government to justify the Twitter disclosure are made public, plus details of any other such cases which have been processed in secret.\nThe Manning connection.\nBradley Manning, at the time a specialist from Maryland enlisted with the United States Army's 2nd Brigade, 10th Mountain Division, was arrested in June last year in connection with the leaking of classified combat video to WikiLeaks.\nThe leaked video footage, taken from a US helicopter gunship, showed the deaths of \"Reuters\" staff and during a U.S. assault in Baghdad, Iraq. The wire agency unsuccessfully attempted to get the footage released via a request in 2007.\nWhen WikiLeaks released the video footage it directly contradicted the official line taken by the U.S. Army asserting that the deaths of the two \"Reuters\" staff were \"collateral damage\" in an attack on Iraqi insurgents. The radio chatter associated with the video indicated the helicopter crews had mistakenly identified the journalists' equipment as weaponry.\nThe US government also claims Manning is linked to CableGate; the passing of around a quarter of a million classified diplomatic cables to WikiLeaks. Manning has been in detention since July last year; in December allegations of torture were made to the United Nations regarding the conditions under which he was and is being detained.\nReports last month that he must now sleep naked and attend role call at the U.S. Marine facility in in the same state, raised further concern over his detention conditions. , at-the-time a State Department spokesman, remarked on this whilst speaking at Massachusetts Institute of Technology; describing the current treatment of Manning as \"ridiculous and counterproductive and stupid\", Crowley was, as a consequence, put in the position of having to tender his resignation to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.\nThe United States Government versus WikiLeaks.\nDespite his native Australia finding, in December last year, that Assange's WikiLeaks had not committed any criminal offences in their jurisdiction, the U.S. government has continued to make ongoing operations very difficult for the whistleblower website.\nThe result of the Australian Federal Police investigation left the country's Prime Minister, Julia Gillard, having to retract a statement that WikiLeaks had acted \"illegally\"; instead, she characterised the site's actions as \"grossly irresponsible\".\nEven with Australia finding no illegal activity on the part of WikiLeaks, and with founder Julian Assange facing extradition to Sweden, U.S. pressure sought to hobble WikiLeaks financially.\nBased on a State Department letter, online payments site PayPal suspended WikiLeaks account in December. Their action was swiftly followed by Visa Europe and Mastercard ceasing to handle payments for WikiLeaks.\nThe online processing company, Datacell, threatened the two credit card giants with legal action over this. However, avenues of funding for the site were further curtailed when both Amazon.com and Swiss bank PostFinance joined the financial boycott of WikiLeaks.\nAssange continues, to this day, to argue that his extradition to Sweden for questioning on alleged sexual offences is being orchestrated by the U.S. in an effort to discredit him, and thus WikiLeaks.\nState-of-the-(Black)-Art, or CyberWarfare.\n\"Wikinews\" consulted an IT and cryptography expert from the Belgian university which developed the current ; explaining modern communications, he stated: \"Cryptography has developed to such a level that intercepting communications is no longer cost effective. That is, if any user uses the correct default settings, and makes sure that he/she is really connecting to Twitter it is highly unlikely that even the NSA can break the cryptography for a protocol such as SSL/TLS (used for https).\"\nQualifying this, he commented that \"the vulnerable parts of the communication are the end points.\" To make his point, he cited the following quote from : \"\"Using encryption on the Internet is the equivalent of arranging an armored car to deliver credit card information from someone living in a cardboard box to someone living on a park bench.\"\nContinuing, the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven (KUL) expert explained:\nViews of a security expert.\n\"Wikinews\" also consulted French IT security researcher Stevens Le Blond on the issues surrounding the case, and the state-of-the-art in monitoring, and analysing, communications online. Le Blond, currently presenting a research paper on attacks on to audiences in North America, responded via email:\nLiberty, and the Electronic Frontier.\nHaving been alerted to the ongoing case through a joint press release by the ACLU and EFF, \"Wikinews\" sought clarification on the primary issues which the two non-profits saw as particularly important in challenging the U.S. Government over the 'secret' court orders. Rebecca Jeschke, Media Relations Director for the EFF, explained in more detail the points crucial to them, responding to a few questions from \"Wikinews\" on the case:\nBirgitta Jonsdottir responds.\nFinally, \"Wikinews\" approached the Icelandic politician, and WikiLeaks supporter, who has made this specific case a landmark in how the U.S. Government handles dealings with \u2013 supposedly \u2013 friendly governments and their elected representatives. A number of questions were posed, seeking the Icelandic Parliamentarian's views:\nOngoing U.S. Government versus WikiLeaks fallout.\nThe U.S. Government continues to have issues internationally as a result of material passed to WikiLeaks, and subsequently published.\nWithin the past week, Ecuador has effectively declared the U.S. ambassador persona-non-grata over corruption allegations brought to light in leaked cables. Asking the veteran diplomat to leave \"as soon as possible\", the country may become the third in South America with no ambassadorial presence. Both Venezuela and Bolivia have no resident U.S. ambassador due to the two left-wing administrations believing the ejected diplomats were working with the opposition.\nThe U.S. State Department has cautioned Ecuador that a failure to speedily normalise diplomatic relations may jeapordise ongoing trade talks.\nThe United Kingdom is expected to press the Obama administration over the continuing detention of 23-year-old Manning, who also holds UK citizenship. British lawmakers are to discuss his ongoing detention conditions before again approaching the U.S. with their concerns that his solitary confinement, and treatment therein, is not acceptable.\nThe 22 charges brought against Manning are currently on hold whilst his fitness to stand trial is assessed."}

The image of such firms has been severely tarnished by repeated revelations of abuse by the U.S. firm , subsequently renamed Xe Services. Blackwater executives and employees have faced civil lawsuits, criminal charges and Congressional investigations related to accusations of bribery and murder in Iraq and Afghanistan. \nThe collapse of numerous investigations related to several alleged incidents has raised questions about the legal accountability of firms operating in war zones on behalf of Western governments.\nThe suggested training of rebels and deployment of contractors appears to confirm Western powers' determination to end Gaddafi's grip on power. \nYesterday's report in The Guardian interprets the move as the start of a new phase in the three-week-old NATO-led intervention in Libya, and a tacit admission by Western nations that the rebels are struggling to make ground despite NATO air support. \nBritain's focus on Arab participation in funding and training the rebels reflects a will on Western powers' part to foster Arab ownership of the intervention, perceived as being crucial to building the legitimacy of the West's support to Libyan rebels.\nAccording to The Guardian, Western military strategy is now turning to cementing the rebels' territorial gains before the negotiation of a ceasefire with the Gaddafi regime."}

According to the DWP staff work under reasonable terms, but \"we have to ensure that our service is available when our customers, who include some of the most vulnerable people in the country, need us.\" To that end the DWP readily admits it uses performance measures to ensure high productivity and performance, their goal is to \"deliver value for money for the taxpayer\", and they do not have any plans to change the way they do business.\nA report in the ' cites more than 500 staff on strike, and quotes PCS regional secretary Peter Middleman describing the culture in-place in Jobcentre Plus contact centres as \"battery-farmed working practices\". Similarly, the ' cites 120 staff on strike at the Cardwell Place call centre and the expectation that 2,500 across the North West of England were expected to take action; Middleman is quoted describing the call centres as \"the modern day equivalents of dark, satanic mills where our members are over worked, overly monitored and forced to endure an obsession with arbitrary targets\". \nThe DWP reported the union informed them approximately 40% of the 9,000 staff in JSP contact centres would be taking action, which tallied with their own estimates.\nFace-to-face Jobcentre services were unaffected by yesterday's strike action; the union have announced that this will be followed with an indefinite ban on members working overtime."}

The Institute determined that United States receives half of its power from coal plants. Some other countries, such as South Africa, Poland and China, use more coal. \"The world is still dependent on non-renewable energy sources \u2013 coal and nuclear with a smattering of oil and gas \u2013 to generate electricity,\" he says, suggesting the IT companies should not be singled out. \nMorgan is also critical of Greenpeace's methodology in gathering the data, as it included only a sample of the data centers of these companies, and some that were not yet completely operational. He noted that because the companies were not always cooperative in disclosing information, Greenpeace estimated a portion of the data. He said that the reader has to \"drill down into the report\" to see the the complete picture. \nAnother criticism of Greenpeace is its definition of coal and nuclear power as \"dirty energy\". Because it does not discharge greenhouse gases, nuclear power is rated more favorably than coal by some environmental organizations. Greenpeace is adamantly against nuclear power's radiation risks."}

He was 84 and had been in hospital since last month, suffering from kidney failure and respiratory problems.\nFollowers and devotees of \u015ar\u012b Baba considered him to be the manifestation of a \"living God\" on Earth and believed he had powers of magic, such as being able to pull things from out of thin air.\nFormer Indian Prime Minister was one of \u015ar\u012b Baba's followers, as was international test cricketer .\nWorshippers carried Baba's image through the streets of Bangalore and extra police were deployed in his hometown of .

In 1993, six people \"died violently in the spiritual leader's private rooms,\" \"The Guardian\" reported. No full explanation has ever been given for the deaths, though speculation of a money dispute has been raised.\nIn a statement, current Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said that the death of the guru was an \"\"irreparable loss\" to India, adding, \"He was a spiritual leader who inspired millions to lead a moral and meaningful life even as they followed the religion of their choice.\"\nThe guru's body is being kept at the hospital amid appeals for his devotees not to flood them to see his body. The public viewing of \u015ar\u012b Baba's body will take place Monday and Tuesday, and a funeral will follow. There are to be four days of mourning in his home state, Andhra Pradesh, by decree of the state government."}

One of those shot is thought to be bin Laden's son. An American helicopter was lost due to mechanical failure, but no U.S. forces or civilians were killed.\nU.S. President Barack Obama announced the news in a statement late last night. \"I can report to the American people and to the world, that the U.S. has conducted an operation that killed Osama bin Laden,\" Obama said. He confirmed he had been told in August of a lead to the location of bin Laden, and approved the operation last week. The operation involved a \"small team of Americans\", Obama said.\nThe operation, led by the CIA, occurred nearly ten years after the 9/11 attacks. CIA director notified U.S. legislators Sunday about the news. His body was verified using several methods, including with DNA from a dead sister's body, stored in a Boston, Massachusetts hospital, as well as facial recognition. However, staff at the hospital in question\u2014\u2014have not been able to \"find any evidence\" of the body ever being stored there. U.S. officials said his body was then buried at sea at around 0600 UTC today, \"in accordance with Islamic law and traditions\" and because of the difficulty of finding a country that would accept the remains of the world's most wanted man. Saudi Arabia, the country in which Osama bin Laden was born, refused a U.S. offer to take the body.\nCelebrations in U.S.; European Parliament says world is 'safer'.\nFollowing the President's announcement, people started gathering in front of the White House in Washington, D.C., and \u2014the site of the \u2014in New York, to celebrate; singing the . Michael Bloomberg, the mayor of New York City, said he hoped the death of bin Laden would \"bring some closure and comfort to all those who lost loved ones on September 11, 2001\".\nThe U.S. government is reportedly expecting al-Qaeda to soon release what they are likely to call a \"martyr tape\"\u2014an audio recording made by bin Laden to be broadcast after his death.\nAlthough the death of the 54-year-old bin Laden, who was the most wanted person in the world, was greeted with celebration in the U.S., analysts have warned that al-Qaeda will \"undoubtedly\" launch a retaliatory attack. \"I think the significance of what has happened cannot really be overstated,\" John Gearson, director of the Centre for Defence Studies at , said. \n\"There will be concerns that there could be some sort of retaliation, that al-Qaeda may well want to demonstrate that they are still strong and still in the game.\" He warned that U.S. officials may \"lose their focus\" after such a major victory, \"and that will provide an opportunity for the remnants of al-Qaeda to reform and grow stronger.\"\nHillary Clinton, the U.S. Secretary of State, appealed to Islamic militant fighters to use the opportunity of bin Laden's death to abandon their groups. \"Our message to the Taliban remains the same, but today it may have even greater resonance: you cannot wait us out,\" she said. \"You cannot defeat us. But you can make the choice to abandon Al Qaeda and cooperate in a peaceful political process.\"\nThe president of the , , said that \"we have waken up in a safer world\", with the news bringing \"safety to millions of people\", whilst U.S. senator John McCain sought to remind the American people to \"be mindful that al-Qaeda and its terrorist allies are still lethal and determined enemies\". The reiterated that \"revenge is inescapable for all terrorists\", and that \"only a joint struggle against global terrorism can bring a result\".\nThe United Kingdom's Foreign Secretary, William Hague, sought to remind people bin Laden was \"the world's most prominent leader\", going on to say that \"it was of great importance that he was still alive and active, and it is unequivocally a good thing that he is no longer able to pursue terror, murder and mayhem in the world\". Mentioning that security at British embassies worldwide have been increased in the wake of the news, he reiterated that the death of the al-Qaeda leader was a \"serious blow\", and that, \"like any organisation that has suffered a serious blow, they will want to show in some way that they are still able to operate\".\nNicolas Sarkozy, the president of France, welcomed the news, along with many other European countries. He praised the \"tenacity\" of the U.S. attack, congratulating the \"major blow\" the move dealt to al-Qaeda. Eight French citizens were killed last week in a bomb blast in , and, although no group has yet claimed responsibility, it is speculated that al-Qaeda were behind the attack. Sarkozy paid homage to them, as well as other around the world, saying the \"victims received justice today and France has thoughts for them and their families\".\nPakistani involvement.\nPakistani officials were not informed of the planned raid, with the White House saying this was \"essential to the security of the operation and our personnel\". However Obama emphasised that cooperation with Pakistan had helped in finding bin Laden. The operation, described by one senior White House official as \"a surgical raid by a small team designed to minimise collateral damage\", was not intended to take bin Laden alive. \"It was a kill mission\", said one security official. Bin Laden died after being shot in the head.\nWitnesses in Abbottabad have described how the U.S. forces carried out the raid on the compound, which had significant security features, including walls up to 18-foot high topped with barbed wire. \"We saw four helicopters at around 2am. We were told to switch off lights of our homes and stay inside,\" one witness, who lives in the town of in Abbottabad, said. The man \nconfirmed he had seen the wreckage of the U.S. military helicopter which crashed after experiencing mechanical difficulties. \nPakistan's said in a statement that the U.S. \"operation was conducted [by] U.S. forces in accordance with declared U.S. policy that Osama bin Laden will be eliminated in a direct action by the U.S. forces, wherever found in the world\", noting that almost \"30,000 Pakistani civilians\" had been killed in terrorist attacks in recent years, with the \"nation fully united in [its] resolve to eliminate terrorism\".\nHowever, Pervez Musharraf, a former president of Pakistan, criticised the U.S. involvement, describing the operation as a \"violation of [Pakistani] sovereignty,\" and saying the raid was a \"a failure of both Pakistani and U.S. intelligence\"; he stressed it would have been \"far better\" if the had carried out the attack. Musharraf went on to say he was \"surprised\" bin Laden was found in Abbottabad, but added the terrorist leader \"had declared war against Pakistan\", and that the news came as a \"victory for the people of Pakistan and all the peace loving people of the world\".\nThe news that bin Laden was hiding just a few hundred metres from , a similar institution to the U.S. or the UK , has been met with embarrassment on behalf of the Pakistani government, and scepticism from others. \"This is a serious blow to the credibility of Pakistan\", according to one Pakistani security analyst. Earlier today, Afghanistan president Hamid Karzai maintained he knew bin Laden was in Pakistan: \"For 10 years we told NATO and the world community but for ten years they didn't listen to our voice. They burned Afghanistan for ten years but Osama was in Islamabad.\"\nWhilst many governments worldwide welcomed the death of bin Laden, more than 800 people marched in the Pakistani city of Quetta, paying homage to bin Laden and burning a U.S. flag. According to the organizer, \"Bin Laden was the hero of the Muslim world and after his martyrdom he has won the title of great \". At the march, pro-Taliban and anti-United States sentiments were chanted, before the protesters dispersed peacefully.\nTehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan have denied that bin Laden has been killed, although in a conference call to several Pakistani media outlets, a rebel spoksperson threatened to seek revenge: \"If Bin Laden attained martyrdom, then we will avenge his death and we will attack the governments of Pakistan and the United States and their security forces\".\nAlthough no images of bin Laden's body have been released, the Obama administration is, according to , in possession of gruesome photographs: a \"massive head wound\" where he took a bullet, with \"blood and brains clearly visible\".\nThe price of oil has dropped following the announcement after speculation that the death of bin Laden will lower the risk of supply disruption in the Middle East, with a barrel of crude oil for June delivery falling by $1.92."}

But the claim by bin Laden's 12-year-old daughter that U.S. forces captured him and then shot him dead in front of his family appear to contradict this statement. The U.S. has also been forced to defend itself against allegations that the raid was unlawful, and claims that bin Laden was not a legitimate target.

It was located and brought to the surface by a Remora 6000 unmanned submarine, then taken aboard the \"\u00cele de Sein\", one of the vessels taking part in the recovery and salvage efforts.\nThis came two days after an announcement on Sunday that the crash-survivable memory unit of the (FDR) of the aircraft had been located and brought to the surface. The chassis of the FDR was located on April 27, with the memory unit missing. It was found a short distance from the chassis. It was also brought to the surface by the Remora 6000.\nWith the recovery of both recorders, which are reported to be \"in good condition\", French officials hope to determine what caused the to crash into the Atlantic Ocean on June 1, 2009, when it departed Rio de Janeiro's before it was lost 600 miles (965 km) off the coast of Brazil en route to Paris' with 228 passengers and crew on board.\nThe leading theory at the moment is that the crew received incorrect air speed readings from the aircraft's , devices which measure how fast the aircraft is traveling. Experts say the tubes may have become iced over, causing the crash. The plane's (ACARS) sent out 24 messages over a four-minute long period stating numerous problems and warnings, including incorrect air speed warnings occurring aboard the aircraft, just prior to it going down.\nHowever, chief operating officer of the International Bureau of Aviation, Phil Seymour, speaking to CNN, believes the memory unit will not be of much use to investigators saying because of the depth it was located at, \"If you were to throw a computer into the ocean, imagine how all the parts would eventually split and you have the corrosive effects of seawater and the depths involved.\" Seymour believes the wreckage will help reveal what happened as more is recovered.\n\"It may be that the more wreckage they find will help them to piece it all together, which bit by bit could help them build a picture of what caused the plane to come down,\" he added.\nA BEA spokesperson had agreed with that possibility a few days earlier when speaking to the Associated Press about the recovery of the flight data recorder. \"We can't say in advance that we're going to be able to read it until it's been opened,\" the spokesperson said. As\nThe wreckage of the Airbus A330-200, was found back on April 8 at a depth of 3,800 and 4,000 meters (2,070 to 2,190 fathoms or 12,467 feet and 13,123 feet), by a team from the , using a Remus robotic submarine and its side-scan sonar. After the wreckage was found, another Remus robot submarine with cameras was sent down to the site, where it filmed bodies in the wreckage. The location of the recorders were localized within 2 square miles (5 square kilometers) of the flight's last position last year.\nIn March, a French judge placed the European aircraft maker Airbus and under investigation for possible involuntary manslaughter charges in the 2009 crash. Both are paying the cost of the search which is estimated to be $12.7 million (nine million euro). The crash is the deadliest in Air France's history."}

The statement from the organization, posted on internet forums, came as the released videos filmed inside the terrorist leader's compound which was raided last weekend. Intelligence officials said at a briefing in Washington, D.C. that the videos showed that bin Laden was still playing an active role in al-Qaeda plotting.\nAlthough the video tapes have no audio, they show bin Laden watching news coverage of himself on television and preparing to record a propaganda film. The tapes are the latest intelligence to emerge from computer equipment seized from bin Laden's compound during the raid on his compound in , Pakistan by last weekend. Earlier this week it emerged bin Laden had been planning an attack on the American rail network on the tenth anniversary of the September 11 attacks this year. U.S. officials yesterday stressed that the al-Qaeda plot was only \"aspirational\", but involved derailing multiple trains by damaging rail lines at various sites. \nTonight one intelligence official said the information gleaned from the computers was the \"single largest collection of senior terrorist materials ever.\" The computer equipment also revealed that there were hopes of attacking major transportation hubs, and that during the six years he lived at the compound in Pakistan, bin Laden stayed in close contact with senior affiliates and played an active role in developing terrorist plots. An unnamed U.S. official told \"The New York Times\" that bin Laden \"wasn't just a figurehead,\" but \"continued to plot and plan, to come up with ideas about targets and to communicate those ideas to other senior al-Qaeda leaders.\"\nConfirming the death of bin Laden in a statement this week, al-Qaeda said his killing would be a \"curse\" on the U.S. and its allies. \"Their happiness will turn into sorrow, and their blood will be mixed with their tears. We call upon our Muslim people in Pakistan, on whose land Sheikh Osama was killed, to rise up and revolt.\" The revelation that al-Qaeda was planning more attacks against the U.S. comes only several days after officials warned the terrorist group was likely to be plotting a revenge attack to avenge the death of bin Laden.\n'We will never forget'.\nFour days after the raid on the compound, U.S. president Barack Obama visited in New York on Thursday to pay tribute to the 3,000 people killed in the September 11 attacks, for which al-Qaeda was found responsible.

But Attorney General contradicted the statement, saying: \"If he had surrendered, attempted to surrender, I think we should obviously have accepted that, but there was no indication that he wanted to do that and therefore his killing was appropriate.\"\nObama's visit came a day after he announced he would not be releasing images of bin Laden's body. In an interview to be aired on \"CBS News\", the president said: \"It is important for us to make sure that very graphic photos of somebody who was shot in the head are not floating around as an incitement to additional violence, as a propaganda tool.\" The images\u2014described as \"very gruesome\"\u2014are reported to show bin Laden shot above the left eye, with parts of his brain exposed.\nGrowing rift in relations.\nAs Obama travelled to New York, the growing rift between the relations of the U.S. and Pakistan was continuing to grow after officials in Islamabad said the U.S. president may have breached U.N. rules by ordering the raid, because Pakistan was not told in advance. Senior officials within the also ordered the number of American military personnel in the country to be cut to \"minimum essential\" levels. , the Pakistani foreign secretary, strained relations further at a press conference when he said there were serious concerns that the U.S. had breached U.N. resolutions on , and said Pakistan is determined to \"uphold our sovereignty and safeguard our security\". Pakistani army officials risked tautening relations between the two countries again on Thursday as they announced they would consider cutting ties with Washington, D.C. if the U.S. mounted another unannounced raid on their soil, and said they would be expelling U.S. military personnel in retaliation.\nThe conflict stems from the raid during the weekend on the Abbottabad compound. Pakistan says it was not informed about the raid, which involved U.S. helicopters flying into Pakistani airspace to drop commandos who raided the house. The rift has grown further after U.S. officials questioned how Pakistani intelligence allowed bin Laden to live in the compound, a short distance from a military training academy, and suggested the terrorist leader may have been harbored by the government. The director of the CIA said earlier this week that Pakistan was not informed about the raid because of fears he was being harbored by Pakistani officials who might warn him about the raid. The president of Pakistan, Asif Ali Zardari, dismissed \"baseless speculation\" that his administration was sheltering bin Laden. \nU.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton insisted tension between Washington and Pakistan over the raid had been exaggerated, and said she was keen to keep relations with Islamabad. \"It is not always an easy relationship. You know that,\" she said. \"But, on the other hand, it is a productive one for both our countries and we are going to continue to cooperate between our governments, our militaries, our law-enforcement agencies, but most importantly between the American and Pakistani people.\""}

The online, collaborative encyclopedia boasts more than 3.5 million articles in English and versions in over 250 languages. Given the website's vast readership, the has proclaimed himself \"a big fan of Wikipedia\" and emphasizes the need for the National Archives to work with the project. The Archives posted the internship listing in March, expressing its desire for an employee who \"will work as a community coordinator and strengthen the relationship between the Archives and the Wikipedian community through a range of activities\".\nMcDevitt-Parks, who describes himself as a \"history buff, a word nerd, a news junkie and an occasional pedant,\" is a 24-year-old graduate student at in Boston. On Wikipedia, he has contributed for more than seven years under the username \"Dominic\", his work focusing mostly on Latin American history.\nHe began his work at the Archives in late May, and since then he has undertaken numerous projects, including uploading onto Wikipedia 200 photos taken by for the . Although those photos have always remained in the public domain, accessing their high-definition versions could be problematic. Researchers who wanted to view the files had to visit the Archives facilities in , Maryland.\nMcDevitt-Parks is also preparing a \"\" on Wikipedia, where works featured as \"Today's Document\" on the Archives' website are also the main focus of newly written or expanded encyclopedia articles displayed on Wikipedia's home page. The first \u2014 and so far only \u2014 winner of the challenge was the Wikipedia article \"\", which incorporated an Archives-held photo of the first African-American recruit to the . Before the challenge, according to McDevitt-Parks, \"a thorough history of desegregation in the U.S. Marines didn't exist in Wikipedia's knowledge ecosystem. The topic wasn't totally ignored, but simply split among related entries; a devoted, focused article never existed solely in its own right.\"\nThe \"Wikipedian in Residence\" position falls within the Archives' social media staff within the Open Government division of Information Services, since the institution's goal is to distribute as much content to the widest audience possible. The internship is 40 hours per week from mid-May to late August.\nInterview.\n Before you started your internship, how close of a relationship did the National Archives have with Wikipedia?\nThere was no official relationship, however the National Archives has long been supportive of Wikipedia. Earlier this year, for instance, the National Archives hosted a meetup in the main DC location in honor of Wikipedia's tenth anniversary. The Archivist of the United States, , is incredibly friendly to Wikipedia, as are many of the National Archives' staff. As he wrote after WikiXDC, \"As an agency, I look forward to our staff learning more about the fabric and culture of Wikipedia and how to get involved.\" He also to the Wikimedia Foundation offering support from the National Archives for the successful Washington D.C. bid for . In all likelihood, this is not a relationship that will end after this summer, either.\n Why is it important that institutions like the National Archives foster this sort of relationship with Wikipedia?\nArchives and other such institutions preserve our cultural heritage not just for the sake of keeping them, but so that we may access and use them. In the 21st century, accessibility is about more than just having exhibitions or a public research room; it is about having a digital presence and proactively delivering content to people with an information need, whether or not they were looking for a particular document from an institution's holding. Wikipedia and its sister projects are perfectly suited for this purpose in a number of ways. The most obvious is \"visibility\". There is no institutional web site in the world that is more popular among general web users than Wikipedia, which is one of the top 10 ranked web sites according to volume of traffic. Its article on a given topic will nearly always rank higher in search engine results than any institution's page, even one about a document actually held by that institution. In general, Wikipedia is the first and often only place online searchers will go to learn about the issues and items in which an institution might specialize. This means that there is no better way to reach the public than Wikipedia, and there is no better way to make one's holdings accessible and\u2014just as important\u2014discoverable than by making it directly available on Wikipedia. The pervasiveness of Wikipedia also means that work to improve it will have much more impact than many other education and outreach programs.\nWikimedia's projects can do more than just reach people, though. It's not merely a content host or a forum, like YouTube, , Facebook, Twitter, and blogs. Wikimedia is a \"community\" with an intellectual mission. It will not only make holdings findable, but it will add value to them. They write encyclopedia articles related to the holdings of cultural institutions, or to subjects for which holdings are valuable source material or illustrations; they organize, categorize, and even sometimes digitally restore images; they transcribe and proofread textual documents. They are doing this for their personal fulfillment, nearly always without the knowledge and cooperation of associated cultural institutions. Indeed, thousands of Wikimedians are already engaged in their own little projects which donated content or expertise can help along; both parties are interested in adding value to their work by partnering with the other.\nFinally, Wikimedia is unique among the major online fora and hosts for cultural content in that it shares cultural institutions' commitment to open access and public education. Wikipedia is a non-profit, and creating free public knowledge is its sole purpose. All original content is released under a free copyright license so that it can be widely disseminated without permission or fee. In fact, its commitment to freedom of information is so strong that it often cannot even accept works from some cultural institutions which restrict their use in some way (such as by disallowing derivative works or requiring non-commercial use), and making institutions truly free and compatible with Wikipedia is one of the jobs of Wikipedans in Residence. Wikipedia is not just a venue for presenting our cultural heritage, it is an active ally for all institutions that seek to do so.\n What aspect of having a Wikipedian in Residence is seen as most valuable to the National Archives? What would you, personally, say is the greatest benefit to any cultural institution from engaging with the Wikimedia community?\nFor the National Archives, all of the above apply. This is about public outreach and increasing access and use. NARA wants to find users where they are, not just wait for them to visit, and the people are on Wikipedia. According to David Ferriero, the National Archives would like this collaboration with Wikipedia to exemplify their \"commitment to the Open Government principles of transparency, participation, and collaboration.\" Wikimedia partnerships are so promising because they can be extensions of any institution's mission in a number of conceivable ways. \n You have already told \"The Washington Post\" that other institutions have hired Wikipedians in residence, including the British Museum, the Museu Picasso, and the Archives of American Art. Do you know of any other institutions that may develop similar relationships with Wikipedia in the near future?\nYou can see a listing of other Wikipedian residencies . There have been several, but still less than ten, and each situation has been unique. I can't really speak to any specific future collaborations being worked on, as I am not privy to those negotiations. However, I will say more generally that these relationships are only going to become more common. Wikimedians and chapters around the world have been in touch with various institutions interested in working with us. I saw and met many of these people firsthand at , which was attended by dozens of excited representatives from cultural institutions attracted by the prospect of a relationship with Wikipedia and just as many incredibly motivated Wikimedians who are involved in reaching out to these institutions. \n Are there other \u2014 non-Wikimedia \u2014 opportunities online you feel the National Archives should look for?\nThe goal of cataloging, describing, digitizing, and transcribing the entire holdings of the National Archives is an impossible one using traditional methods and within traditional budget constraints. Cultural institutions need to engage the interested public to become active partners in preserving cultural heritage, rather than simply consumers. The work with Wikimedia is an important aspect of that new thinking, but there are all sorts of allied projects out there that would also make good partners. This includes similar crowdsourced projects for scanning and transcription, which the National Archives is already seeking out, as well as other specialized groups interested in digital history or particular topic areas.\n How have your experiences \u2014 both in school and in Wikipedia \u2014 prepared you for this job?\nI am a history geek and an archivist-in-training. In my life off of Wikipedia, I have an undergraduate history degree, have worked in library/archive settings before, and am currently pursuing master's degrees in both history and library science (archives management). I think these real-life experiences in their field are one of the main reasons that the National Archives was comfortable letting me on to their staff. I hope to be able to relate to the people and the practices here on a higher level than the average Wikimedian. I believe strongly in the work and the mission of the National Archives completely apart from how it syncs up with Wikipedia.\nAs a Wikimedian, I have been deeply immersed in various aspects of the project for many years now. I first started back in 2004, and have been an administrator since 2005. Along the way, I served as arbitrator, CheckUser, oversighter, and OTRSer, gaining a useful perspective on some of the project's inner workings and (for lack of a better word) governance. I've also done outreach to real people as a for university students in Boston. I am cross-project Wikimedian, having also been very involved in over the years, where I am also an administrator. I have written content ranging from dictionary definitions of modern colloquialisms to articles on Chilean revolutionaries. But, most importantly, I hope that my familiarity with the culture and practices of Wikimedians will help facilitate this National Archives collaboration. \n Having worked in the National Archives for a few weeks now, has your approach to or perception of your work in Wikipedia or the National Archives changed in any way?\nI really wasn't sure what to expect when I got here. The staff have all been exceedingly welcoming and cooperative which is a major relief. The real work has been figuring out what I can do and where best to spend my time. Most of the National Archives' documents are not digitized, and possibly not even cataloged on the item-level. Those certainly include some items that Wikimedians would like to use for their projects, but it remains to be seen how much I can realistically do in one summer with those documents. I do want to get as much digital content as possible on , but aside from the technological challenges we face at Commons in trying to figure out how to do mass uploads, the situation with the National Archives' scan files is just as much of a barrier. They are often confusingly named, difficult to locate, or incomplete. I hit the ground running with the upload of an important batch of Ansel Adams photographs, but it turns out that that was actually the lowest-possible hanging fruit.\n What challenges do you foresee having to face in your work?\nThe real challenges are about organization, both of documents\u2014as I mentioned\u2014and of people.\nOne of the biggest challenges is that we need Wikimedians to get on board with the project in a big way. This is an incredible opportunity for us as a project, but it requires a special community effort to take full advantage of it. We need volunteers to tag articles, to categorize media, to help with templates and coding tools, to write related article content, to transcribe and proofread texts, to add new images to articles, to digitally restore images, and so on. I can personally serve as the point of contact between the National Archives and Wikimedia, but it needs to be much more than that to be a successful project. At this point, the project spaces I am creating on-wiki are my attempt to create an inviting and useful infrastructure to serve as a hub for this effort, but they are not organically grown like most Wikimedia projects. I, and various helpers with templates and coding, have magicked them into existence in the last few weeks. They need participants to sign up and adopt them as their own so we can really get the ball rolling.\n \"The New York Times\" reported in January that less than fifteen percent of Wikipedia's contributors are women. The article raised concerns that this gender gap has affected the relative emphasis of topics covered on the encyclopedia. In what ways would this problem affect your own efforts to organize the Wikipedia community, and how do you plan to address it?\nThis is an issue that I care strongly about. (And somewhat relatedly, I served, and will continue to serve, as Campus Ambassador at a women's college, and it was a wonderful experience.) The problem is really about more than gender imbalance; it's about having a community that represents a diversity of backgrounds, viewpoints, and personalities. Those of us who work in the humanities can also sometimes feel like a minority on Wikipedia, as one would expect from a male-dominated culture. There is a lot of room for improvement on Wikipedia of articles related to women's history\u2014as well as the history of minority and non-Western peoples\u2014and the National Archives has some incredible resources for these topics. One of the things that I would like to be able to do at the National Archives is to tap their existing pool of volunteers and funnel them towards NARA-related volunteerism on Wikimedia projects. As a national organization with various facilities and presidential libraries throughout the country, there is a lot of potential for various local volunteer communities to get involved. Institutions like the National Archives have volunteers eager to help their cause, but who would otherwise not get involved in Wikipedia, and this group of people likely has a very different demographic makeup than Wikipedia as a whole. I can attest that the library/archives community is certainly not male-dominated. The National Archives is interested in collaborating with Wikipedia not because it wants to lay work at the feet of the Wikipedia community specifically, but because it wants Wikipedia to be a platform for the public at large to be able to become active participants in preserving and interpreting their cultural heritage. This plan also means organizing a corresponding corps of Wikipedian volunteers to welcome and mentor such new editors.\n Which aspects of this particular internship attracted you more than any other job opportunity you could have obtained?\nI am a longtime, obsessive Wikimedian with a passion for history who is studying to become an archivist. Every aspect of the opportunity attracted me as soon as I learned about it. :-)"}

The court ruled the company may appeal the restrictions placed on it by a government order hindering the company's ability to conduct its own internal investigation of the disaster. \nThe order controlling Massey's investigations into the disaster was placed on Massey immediately after the incident by the (MSHA) when it seized control of the coal mine six hours after the blast on April 5.\nMSHA's controls prohibited Massey from \"taking or retaining photographs, collecting and preserving mine dust samples, employing mine mapping technology, and participating in or objecting to any destructive testing of materials gathered underground.\" Massey said MSHA's restrictions prevented the company from evaluating the accident site before it was altered by investigators, and denied Massey the chance to gather evidence to use in the company's defense.\nMassey's appeal to the (the commission that decides disputes over mining regulations) to void the order by MSHA was denied by the commission. It based its decision on its interpretation of the that it had no authority to consider Massey's appeal. The set aside this decision, finding the commission's interpretation of the act was \"simply untenable\" and the government's actions had denied Massey the opportunity to gather \"potentially important exculpatory evidence\".\nThe court rejected the commission's position that the Mine Act's language was ambiguous, allowing the government flexibility in its implementation. Rather, the court said, \"No matter how you parse it, [the act] is a model of near-perfect clarity. Indeed, it is hard to imagine a clearer expression of congressional language.\" It also rejected the commission's position that the case was moot: \"This case is not moot. Indeed, even the counsel recognized the near-frivolity of this argument, and made only a half-hearted attempt to persuade us.\"\nThe court's ruling comes after a state government-comissioned report issued on May 19 by investigators found Massey Energy responsible for the deaths of the 29 workers. The workers were killed in an explosion that could have been avoided, the report said, if Massey had put in place standard safety procedures.\n\"The story of Upper Big Branch is a cautionary tale of hubris. A company that was a towering presence in the coal fields operated its mines in a profoundly reckless manner, and 29 coal miners paid with their lives for the corporate risk taking,\" the report read. \"The company's ventilation system did not adequately ventilate the mine. As a result, explosive gases were allowed to build up.\" The report detailed claims Massey threatened miners with termination if they stopped work in areas that lacked adequate oxygen levels and listed numerous other state and federal safety standards that Massey failed to follow. Also blamed in the report was MSHA for failing to enforce federal regulations.\nThe report was considered by the those in the mining industry as especially direct and \"hard hitting\". It firmly rejected conclusions reached by Massey officials that the incident was caused by an unexpected, massive, and uncontrollable bubble eruption, an occurrence that Massey said it could neither predict nor manage. \nThe company immediately challenged the report and issued its own report on June 3, blaming the blast on an act of nature and denying the company's safety culture was at fault. MSHA also have an as-yet unreleased report in the works."}

Every person -- great and not -- who has struggled for the full equality of the body politic. \nFirst among these for me are , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , Charles Allen Rochelle, Dr. Richard Michael Settainte Harris, Sam W. Barnes, Ron Paul and . , , , every woman tortured to death for refusing to either declare herself a witch (or renounce the same) to the Church, , , , , , , , , Rosalie Rochelle, , , , D. Jill Barnes, and Jennifer R. Harris. \nWho did you support in the , , and presidential elections?\n, George W. Bush, George W. Bush, Ron Paul. Earlier on in my adult life, my political activities were limited to voting for the same party candidates as had my parents. However, as I began to read the Constitution thoroughly, and in the wake of its many abuses perpetrated by those same candidates, I began looking for others who espoused to strictly follow the Constitution as well as the Founders' Philosophies which underlie it. \nThis pursuit led me to Ron Paul and the discovery of Libertarianism. I will never again vote for any candidate based upon their party affiliation. What will now and forever dominate my decision is a candidate's demonstrated commitment to the Constitution and the Philosophy of Liberty. \nHave you run for public office previously?\nYes, I was a . Due to no in Oklahoma for Libertarian Party Candidates at that time, I ran as a \"Ron Paul\" Libertarian . Though Ron himself has a policy of non-endorsement of GOP [] primary challengers against GOP incumbents, I was able to secure the endorsement of Senator for my congressional campaign. \nWhy did you choose to run as a Libertarian?\nBecause no other party so ardently champions the Philosophy of Liberty over and Constitutional Governance over Tyranny. Were they alive today, every single one of the Founders would be Libertarians. Since that age, each new generation's battle to tear down the scourges of racism, sexism, classism, bigotry, political persecution and/or religious intolerance, has been made possible by appeal to the principles espoused in the Constitution even if the people who ratified it were limited by the tolerance levels of their own generation. \nThus has the time come for candidates running on our Founders' Platform to rise up, proud of the political lineage whose generations' long aim has been the complete equality of the body politic, yet humble and weary of how prejudice undermines that legacy as well as the Philosophy of Liberty itself. Giving in to socialism will not erase the moral mistakes of the past, but it will return our children to the states of slavery and involuntary servitude against which we have so long struggled. \nWhat do you feel sets you apart from your fellow contenders for the Libertarian Party presidential nomination?\nI do more than preach Libertarianism, or prognosticate about all the ways the GOP or the DNC [] candidates will most certainly carry on with their tyrannies and usurpations of power, given the opportunity. \nI articulate bold policy positions, as well as the means to institute them, based upon the Philosophy of Liberty and the Constitution with the aim of restoring Freedom, Liberty and the Republic. This is the definition of political courage, as taking these strong positions makes me a target for the bullets and blows of the enemies of Liberty. \nBut we are in the fight of our age and we must have champions willing to trade blows with the enemy, not merely repeat Libertarian platitudes. Educational campaigns have been the mainstay of the Libertarian Party since its founding; but if we are going to take that next step \u2014 to actually convince the body politic that we can put into policy that which we preach, then we must nominate a candidate who is not afraid step out, armed with the courage of conviction and lead on every issue. \nOf course our ability to do this is tied to cogent articulation of the philosophy which underlies our political ideology, but for too long have our other candidates engaged in academic debates for their own sake, and not actually deigned to apply that for which they argue to that which they will do. That being said, the biggest thing that separates me from my Libertarian Colleagues is that I am not running this race merely to educate or to increase the Party's ballot access; I am running to win and I believe with all my heart that we can be -- and that we must be -- victorious. \nHow often do you campaign and how would that change if you won the nomination?\nI campaign for several hours each day. Once I win the nomination the only thing that will change is that I will have to add much more travel to the schedule. \nIf elected, what would you do as president?\nI will defend the Republic and the Lives, Liberty and Property of . This I will do by way of projecting to the world our strength at home and in ; and by ending all government infringements of the Constitution and of the . The authority to act on this promise is found in the to \"preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.\" I will do no more than this and certainly no less.\nPolicy.\nWhat necessary freedoms are currently lacking in American society?\nWith the exception of the , the Natural Rights codified in, and the privileges and immunities established by, the remaining nine amendments of the , along with elements of the and amendments, are routinely infringed by all through their collective and Progressive Establishment of Socialism in place of Freedom and Liberty. \nThese charges are made manifest by appeal to some of the very same made by the Founders of this Republic against the for promulgating some of the same tyrannies which are now being foisted upon We the People by our own federal government. \nTo enumerate only a few levied by the our federal government has \n1. \"\u2026erected a Multitude of new Offices, and sent hither Swarms of Officers to harass our People, and eat out their Substance.\" \n2. \"\u2026kept among us, in Times of Peace, [and at our expense] standing Armies\u2026\" \n3. \"\u2026combined with others [NATO and the United Nations] to subject us to a Jurisdiction foreign to our Constitution, and unacknowledged by our Laws; giving [its] Assent to their Acts of pretended Legislation.\" \n4. \"\u2026[cut]off our Trade with all Parts of the World [for products or services with which the elected majority finds disfavor]\" \n5. \"\u2026[imposed] taxes upon us without our consent [by way of deficit spending which will have to be repaid by those not yet old enough to vote]\" \n6. \"\u2026suspended and deprived \"\u2026us in many Cases of the Benefits of Trial by Jury [ and ] \n7. \"\u2026[taken] away our Charters, [abolished] our most valuable Laws, and [altered] fundamentally the Forms of our Governments\" [this referring to the federal government's many infringements of out states' sovereignty] \n8. \"\u2026[declared] themselves invested with Power to legislate for us in [nearly] all Cases whatsoever\" [by way of gross misuse of the , the as well as many others to pass, sign and uphold onerous legislation which would never be countenanced by a free People] \n9. waged the and \"\u2026War(s) against us [and in so doing] has plundered our Seas, ravaged our Coasts, burned [or seized] our [property], [invaded our privacy, killed citizens attempting to defend their property, sexually assaulted women and children attempting to travel] and destroyed the Lives of our People.\"\n\"In every stage of these Oppressions we have Petitioned for Redress in the most humble Terms [by begging for the cessation of: bailouts (), social welfares (), undeclared foreign Wars (, , , Iraq and ), and the devaluation of our Wealth ( and the over-printing of a declining and unconstitutional ), the theft and destruction of our Property () along with the killing and incarceration of our People (the Civil War on Drugs), the sexual assault of our Women and Children in the name of security (), the gross infringements of our Privacy (the Patriot Act) ]: \nOur repeated Petitions have been answered only by repeated Injury [after TARP came bailouts for a host of corporations, the social welfares are too numerous to list, the War in Libya goes on despite its gross unconstitutionality as does the despite having met the objectives contained in the Letter of Reprisal authorizing our actions there, the debt limit is about to be raised once again, the continues its (money printing), the Civil War on Drugs rages on despite the previous failure of prohibition and trillions spent to curb private behavior in the name of morality all to no avail, the sexual assaults being perpetrated by the TSA continue despite several state legislatures attempting to nullify them, the Patriot Act was just extended and all of this despite most of these actions not having the approval of the VAST majority of the People]. \nA Prince [or central Government] whose Character is thus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the Ruler of a free People.\" \nIt should be clear then by the enumeration of this \"long Train of Abuses and Usurpations,\" which represents but a tiny fraction of the same which our central government is using to pursue \"invariably the same Object\" and that it \"evinces a Design to reduce [us] under absolute Despotism.\" \nThus by the precedent established by the Declaration of Independence, and the Founding of the Republic itself under similar, if not even less trying circumstances, that it is the Right and Duty of We the People to use the political process still available to us to \"throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for [our] future Security\" as well as restore our Constitution and our Republic. \nAs a potential Candidate for the Libertarian Party's Presidential Nomination I would encourage the People to begin this restorative political process by electing to the Office of President the MOST Constitutionally Libertarian Candidate available and to continue it by doing the same in the election of all future federal representatives to the Congress REGARDLESS of their perceived political experience. \nFor certainly it is the case that nearly every single member of all three branches of the federal government are very experienced career politicians and yet the state of our Republic and the condition of our Freedom and Liberty are worse off now that they have been at any time since our founding. \nWhen is government necessary?\nTo protect the Lives, Liberty and Property of the Citizens of the Republic.\nIn a market with little or no government regulation, what prevents an entity from seizing the entire means of production and becoming the new main regulator?\nThe freedom and innovation of inventors and the entrepreneurialism of their investors to produce substitute markets, products and/or services to compete with any of the same being seized or monopolized. \nIn context of government's role, what are your stands on the legality of , and ?\nAs reprehensible as are incest and bestiality, policing them remains a matter of state sovereignty under the . However, allowance of child pornography entails the government's enforcement of , 13th and 14th Amendment violations against children and could therefore be policed by the Federal Government should the States or fail to do so. \nDo you disagree with any parts of the Bill of Rights?\nNo.\nShould the people of the United States have a right to constitutionally amend the Bill of Rights to increase the power of the federal government and limit individual rights?\nYes, according to , our Founders, and the Philosophy of Liberty, no government actions conducted outside the consent of the People are legitimate. The Constitution is our codification of that consent and, as such, it is supreme over all other political ideologies. Of course I would very publicly argue, using the Philosophy of Liberty, for the People to NEVER consider such measures but it is their right to affect them by way of the amendment process. \nShould the lives of American citizens be valued above citizens of other nations?\nAs it applies to the Natural Rights, those being Life, Liberty and Property, of all People found to be under the jurisdiction of the United States; no. However, as it applies to providing for the common Defense of We the People and the Republic; yes. \nWhat are your views on immigration?\nI will fight to eliminate the social and the high taxes required to pay for it, which are chasing our jobs and prosperity overseas. Simultaneously, I will seek from the Congress a very robust and permissive immigration policy to help grow our , making us more competitive with other emerging markets around the world.\nI will deploy the backed up by the to protect Border State property owners from violent cross-border organized crime enterprises and syndicates. \nWhen is war necessary?\nWhen the Lives, Liberty or Property of We the People are being infringed by a foreign entity.\nAre you a , , neither or both?\nNeither, although I do intend to ensure the highest level of executive and administrative transparency which will do much to resolve the propensity of some towards conspiracy theories, as well as expose potential conspiracies before they can fully develop. Since this has been sorely lacking from our government of late, I will direct the to fully investigate any reasonably perceived recent lapses in the executive oversight of the federal government's activities."}

Massive floods have devastated the central and southern parts of the country, causing rivers to overflow their banks and triggering mudslides. The rains follow the worst in China in over 50 years, which has decimated crop yields. \nOverall, 40 rivers have risen above safe limits, stressing dykes and dams including those on China's largest waterway, the , which is flooding downstream while experiencing a severe drought near its source in the north. \nChina's disaster level has been raised to four, the highest on the scale. In a statement on its website on Friday, China's said, \"Since June 13, the damage caused by the rainstorms has led to ... the emergency evacuation of 671,200 people to safety.\"\nThe current round of heavy rains began in early June.

But villagers have reported that survival is difficult, especially for those still trapped by the flood waters in small villages, and distribution of aid is slow, with some not receiving any. \nA villager was quoted by Reuters: \"To be frank, those rescue boats cannot go through those narrow lanes inside the village. A lot of them depend on their relatives rowing small wooden boats to get to them... It is hard to help these people inside there.\" Another villager, Shou Pengfei said, \"Some did not even get any relief items. There is no electricity and you get bitten by mosquitoes all the time.\" \nAccording to the Beijing Climate Centre, weather trends have shifted drastically. Currently the rain is coming in shorter but fiercer bursts, with protracted periods of drought in between the torrential rain. \nThe heavy rainfall is not likely to reduce the crop failure caused by months of drought, especially in the north, the heart of China's grain-growing bread basket, where many rivers have dried up. According to reports, the northern countryside has been left devastated by the droughts. Huge dams hundreds of meters wide are now small, muddy pools. Large cities such as are draining the underground water sources and China is facing a long-term water crisis.\nMeanwhile, China is engaged in a huge multi-year engineering project designed to move water to the parched north and away from the flooded south. The North-South water project is a massive series of canals and pipes designed to carry water from the Yangtze and rivers to Beijing.\nIt is likely, analysts predict, that Chinese crop shortages will increase food prices worldwide. Even before the latest flooding, the severe drought in the north caused a shortfall in China's crop yields that will likely affect the price of wheat and may propel a price increase in global markets."}

Harris, radio host Jim Duensing, former Nevada Libertarian Party chair Jim Burns, marketing executive Roger Gary and attorney Carl Person. 2008 Vice presidential nominee is also expected to make a run.\nInterview.\nTen personal questions were asked followed by ten policy questions. \nPersonal.\nWhat are some of your personal achievements?\nFounder and editor of LibertyForAll.net, America's premier online libertarian newsletter.\nLeading the most-successful volunteer drive for the Libertarian Party of North Carolina.\nServing three terms on the ; one term as Vice Chair.\nPresident of the Foundation for a Free Society, a 3 non-profit educational organization dedicated to promoting the principles of liberty, personal sovereignty, private property, and free markets in order to create a more free and prosperous society.\nWhat are your goals in life?\nRight now I am focused on bringing a peaceful America to my children and grandchildren.\nHave you ever been arrested or charged with a crime?\nNo.\nWhat historical or contemporary figures do you admire?\nI admire most of the Founders, but especially and .\nWho did you support in the , , and presidential elections?\n, Harry Browne, , \nHave you run for public office previously?\nA couple of times for local offices, however, I have managed numerous campaigns for other candidates at the local, state and national level.\nWhy did you choose to run as a Libertarian?\nI am seeking the nomination because the Libertarian Party faces a critical test in 2012 and I want to make sure that we're up to the challenge. The Libertarian message in 2012 must be loud, clear and unequivocal call to \u2013 stop all war! We must stop the wars in and , we must stop the and , we must Stop the War on , we must stop the wars on food, healthcare, guns \u2013 you name it. \nWhat do you feel sets you apart from your fellow contenders for the Libertarian Party presidential nomination?\nI've been active in the Libertarian Party and libertarian movement all my adult life. I've never been afraid to passionately champion the unvarnished libertarian message of individual liberty and personal responsibility. Other candidates have tried to refine, revise or remake the libertarian message in order to appeal to voters. That tactic has failed not only the party, but the cause of liberty, as well. Instead, I propose to embrace the principled libertarian message and will not be afraid to speak truth to power. \nHow often do you campaign and how would that change if you won the nomination?\nI am campaigning every day, either in person, online or on the phone and that will not change when I am honored with the Libertarian Party nomination.\nIf elected, what would you do as president?\nMy first order of business will be to disengage the United States from the tangle of misguided, immoral and unconstitutional military conflicts we are involved in by using the same authority and power as so many presidents have abused to get us mired in these quagmires in the first place. \nPolicy.\nWhat necessary freedoms are currently lacking in American society?\nAll our freedoms are currently under attack by and politicians who have conjured up myriads of excuses, \"imaginary s\" to wage war on American citizens and the world. They have manipulated events to distract, divide and terrorize Americans into willingly sacrificing their liberty before the great false god of Security. \nWhen is government necessary?\nGovernment is only necessary to protect individual life, liberty and property. The only just and \"necessary\" government is one, as James Madison said, \"which impartially secures to every man whatever is his own.\"\nIn a market with little or no government regulation, what prevents an entity from seizing the entire means of production and becoming the new main regulator?\nGovernment regulation is in reality a method by which large businesses with power and influence use government power to benefit themselves at the expense of smaller competitors. In a truly free market, there will always be competition to prevent one entity from seizing the entire means of production. \nIn context of government's role, what are your stands on the legality of incest, bestiality and ?\nWhile these practices might be repulsive to most people, as they are to me, government cannot stop them from happening. Libertarians believe people should be free to make choice for themselves about their lifestyle, so long as they do not harm others. In all cases where violations of human rights occur, the proper role of government is to prosecute those who have committed the violation.\nDo you disagree with any parts of the ?\nNo, except that I believe the should have been the first.\nShould the people of the United States have a right to constitutionally amend the Bill of Rights to increase the power of the federal government and limit individual rights?\nNo individual, or groups of individuals, has the right to limit another individual's rights. Our rights come from our Creator, not from any government or document. Two people, 200 people, 2 million people, even the world's populations combined do not have more rights than one person. That is why when it comes to human rights, no number is greater than one.\nShould the lives of American citizens be valued above citizens of other nations?\nNo. All human beings have equal value. No race, color, creed, nationality, language group, ethnic group \u2013 no human being \u2013 is of more value than any other. We are all equal under the Creator. Freedom has no race. Liberty knows no color.\nWhat are your views on immigration?\nThe so-called \"\" issue is an economic issue and should be treated as such. We must change immigration law to match the reality of a dynamic society and labor market. Instead of building walls we should be opening doors. America should be creating a sane and humane immigration process to screen out terrorists and criminals while allowing honest, peaceful, hardworking people to come here to work and help build on the as millions have done before them. \nWhen is war necessary?\nAs C.K. Chesterton said, \"The only defensible war is a war of defense.\" The libertarian principle of non-aggression does not mean you can't defend yourself. If the United States is attacked, we should defend ourselves using whatever force is necessary, and all the power at our disposal to stop the attack quickly and decisively. But we do not have the right to maintain an occupation force or engage in \"\" in the aggressor nation.\nAre you a , , neither or both?\nNone of the above. I am a Libertarian."}

The data came from the spacecraft's direct analysis of salt-rich ice grains close to the jets ejected from the moon. The study has been published in this week's edition of the journal .\nData from Cassini's cosmic dust analyzer show the grains expelled from fissures, known as tiger stripes, are relatively small and usually low in salt far away from the moon. Closer to the moon's surface, Cassini found that relatively large grains rich with sodium and potassium dominate the plumes. The salt-rich particles have an \"ocean-like\" composition and indicate that most, if not all, of the expelled ice and water vapor comes from the evaporation of liquid salt-water. When water freezes, the salt is squeezed out, leaving pure water ice behind. \nCassini's ultraviolet imaging spectrograph also recently obtained complementary results that support the presence of a subsurface ocean. A team of Cassini researchers led by Candice Hansen of the in , Arizona, measured gas shooting out of distinct jets originating in the moon's south polar region at five to eight times the speed of sound, several times faster than previously measured. These observations of distinct jets, from a 2010 flyby, are consistent with results showing a difference in composition of ice grains close to the moon's surface and those that made it out to the E ring, the outermost ring that gets its material primarily from Enceladean jets. If the plumes emanated from ice, they should have very little salt in them.\n\"There currently is no plausible way to produce a steady outflow of salt-rich grains from solid ice across all the tiger stripes other than salt water under Enceladus's icy surface,\" said Frank Postberg, a Cassini team scientist at the in .\nThe data suggests a layer of water between the moon's rocky core and its icy mantle, possibly as deep as about 50 miles (80 kilometers) beneath the surface. As this water washes against the rocks, it dissolves salt compounds and rises through fractures in the overlying ice to form reserves nearer the surface. If the outermost layer cracks open, the decrease in pressure from these reserves to space causes a plume to shoot out. Roughly 400 pounds (200 kilograms) of water vapor is lost every second in the plumes, with smaller amounts being lost as ice grains. The team calculates the water reserves must have large evaporating surfaces, or they would freeze easily and stop the plumes.\n\"We imagine that between the ice and the ice core there is an ocean of depth and this is somehow connected to the surface reservoir,\" added Postberg.\nThe Cassini mission discovered Enceladus' water-vapor and ice jets in 2005. In 2009, scientists working with the cosmic dust analyzer examined some sodium salts found in ice grains of Saturn's E ring but the link to subsurface salt water was not definitive. The new paper analyzes three Enceladus flybys in 2008 and 2009 with the same instrument, focusing on the composition of freshly ejected plume grains. In 2008, Cassini discovered a high \"density of volatile gases, water vapor, carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide, as well as organic materials, some 20 times denser than expected\" in geysers erupting from the moon. The icy particles hit the detector target at speeds between 15,000 and 39,000 MPH (23,000 and 63,000 KPH), vaporizing instantly. Electrical fields inside the cosmic dust analyzer separated the various constituents of the impact cloud.\n\"Enceladus has got warmth, water and organic chemicals, some of the essential building blocks needed for life,\" said Dennis Matson in 2008, Cassini project scientist at NASA's in Pasadena, .\n\"This finding is a crucial new piece of evidence showing that environmental conditions favorable to the emergence of life can be sustained on icy bodies orbiting gas giant planets,\" said Nicolas Altobelli, the European Space Agency's project scientist for Cassini.\n\"If there is water in such an unexpected place, it leaves possibility for the rest of the universe,\" said Postberg."}

Any demonstrated effects are both small and indistinguishable from effects produced by other media. Since California has declined to restrict those other media, e.g., Saturday morning cartoons, its video-game regulation is wildly under-inclusive, raising serious doubts about whether the State is pursuing the interest it invokes or is instead disfavoring a particular speaker or viewpoint.\"\nAccording to Nadine Kaslow, professor and chief psychologist at and , the evidence regarding the .

Drink-driving convictions came in 2008 and 2010 as Myllyl\u00e4 fought alcoholism, and he was thrice convicted of assault. He and his wife Suvi were divorced in 2007.\n\"A champion has passed into eternity,\" according to ex-Finnish Ski Association CEO Jari Piirainen. \"Although Mika will of course be remembered for his sporting achievements, we should of course remember that he was also a father.\" Piirainen also reflected on media attention towards Myllyl\u00e4: \"Maybe it's just... how much pressure we put on our idols and sportsmen. And how do we deal with them when they are at the top \u2013 do we accept that people are people and accept that everyone makes mistakes, and forgive them?\"\nPiirainen himself was caught up in the doping scandal after a news story into Finnish doping led to a libel case. Piirainen's statements in court led to him facing a fraud trial, but he was cleared.\n\"My heart is broken,\" Myllyl\u00e4 said when his doping was exposed \"and there is no way to describe the amount of my agony with words. I kneel down, admit my defeat and beg for peace for my soul.\" The then-culture minister, , said at the time \"Everyone who felt joy at the success of the team now feels betrayed.\"\nMyllyl\u00e4 fathered three children, whom he is survived by."}

The first signs were detected on December 5, 2010 by instruments aboard the Cassini spacecraft when it recorded lightening outbursts in a small bright area on Saturn's northern half.

The cognitive abilities of reptiles have rarely been studied.\nIn a color discriminating task, the lizards learned to flip over the correctly colored cap to reveal a worm hidden underneath. The experiment was conducted at and the results, published in the , suggest that the problem-solving abilities of reptiles may be greater than previously thought. \nThe Puerto Rican lizard, (an ), used in the study, is a well-studied species, known to excel at foraging food by being acutely aware of movement. Several lizards of this species were collected from Puerto Rico for the experiment.\nResearches first wanted to determine if the six lizards used in the study were able to figure out how to flip off the cap to obtain the food. The agile reptiles quickly learned to use one of two ways to move the cap: they closed their jaws on the edge of the cap and dragged it off the food, or ran into the cap with their heads, tipping it over and grabbing the food.\nThe lizards were then given a choice between two caps; one was blue and the other was yellow and blue; under only one was the food reward of a worm. They quickly learned to distinguish which cap had the reward.\n\"They learned to associate the color of the [cap] with a food reward,\" said Manual Leal, the Duke University researcher who led the study. Their success on a test that is based on worms and usually used on birds was \"completely unexpected,\" he said.\nThe lizards solved the problem in fewer tries than birds needed to flip the correct cap and pass the test, Leal explained. Lizards get just one chance per day because they eat less, while birds usually get up to six chances a day. Thus a mistake by a lizard means it must remember until the next day how to correct the mistake, Leal said.\nAnd when the color of the caps was switched, after a few mistakes two of the lizards were able to figure out the trick. \"We named these two Plato and Socrates,\" said Leal. \nJonathan Losos, a biologist at not involved in the study, said Leal's experiment demonstrates that when faced with a new situation, most of the lizards were able to solve the problem. They had the ability to figure out the trick and disregard their previous learning; a sign of a cognitively advanced animal that some mammalian species cannot easily do. \nThe results \"should cause researchers to re-evaluate what they think they know about the evolution of animal cognition,\" Losos said."}

Edinburgh's Chambers Street was closed to traffic for the morning, with the 10am reopening by eleven-year-old Bryony Hare, who took her first steps in the museum, and won a competition organised by the local paper to be a VIP guest at the event. Prior to the opening, \"Wikinews\" toured the renovated museum, viewing the new galleries, and some of the 8,000 objects inside.Dressed in attire, Scottish broadcaster acted as master of ceremonies over festivities starting shortly after 9am. The packed street cheered an animatronic created by Millenium FX; onlookers were entertained with a twenty-minute performance by the Mugenkyo Drummers on the steps of the museum; then, following Bryony Hare knocking three times on the original doors to ask that the museum be opened, the ceremony was heralded with a specially composed fanfare \u2013 played on a replica of the museum's 2,000-year-old war-horn. During the fanfare, two unfurled white pennons down either side of the original entrance.\nThe completion of the opening to the public was marked with Chinese firecrackers, and fireworks, being set off on the museum roof. As the public crowded into the museum, the Mugenkyo Taiko Drummers resumed their performance; a street theatre group mingled with the large crowd, and the animatronic Tyrannosaurus Rex entertained the thinning crowd of onlookers in the centre of the street.\nPress preview.\nOn Wednesday, the museum welcomed the world's press for an in depth preview of the new visitor experience. \"Wikinews\" was represented by Brian McNeil, who is also Wikimedia UK's interim liaison with .\n__NOEDITSECTION__\nThe new pavement-level Entrance Hall saw journalists mingle with curators. The director, Gordon Rintoul, introduced presentations by Gareth Hoskins and Ralph Applebaum, respective heads of the Architects and Building Design Team; and, the designers responsible for the rejuvenation of the museum.\nDescribing himself as a \"local lad\", Hoskins reminisced about his grandfather regularly bringing him to the museum, and pushing all the buttons on the numerous interactive exhibits throughout the museum. Describing the nearly 150-year-old museum as having become \"a little tired\", and a place \"only visited on a rainy day\", he commented that many international visitors to Edinburgh did not realise that the building was a public space; explaining the focus was to improve access to the museum \u2013 hence the opening of street-level access \u2013 and, to \"transform the complex\", focus on \"opening up the building\", and \"creating a number of new spaces [...] that would improve facilities and really make this an experience for 21st century museum visitors\".\nHoskins explained that a \"rabbit warren\" of storage spaces were cleared out to provide street-level access to the museum; the floor in this \"crypt-like\" space being lowered by 1.5 metres to achieve this goal. Then Hoskins handed over to Applebaum, who expressed his delight to be present at the reopening.\nApplebaum commented that one of his first encounters with the museum was seeing \"struggling young mothers with two kids in strollers making their way up the steps\", expressing his pleasure at this being made a thing of the past. Applebaum explained that the Victorian age saw the opening of museums for public access, with the National Museum's earlier incarnation being the \"College Museum\" \u2013 a \"first window into this museum's collection\".\nThe museum itself is physically connected to the 's old college via a bridge which allowed students to move between the two buildings.\nApplebaum explained that the museum will, now redeveloped, be used as a social space, with gatherings held in the Grand Gallery, \"turning the museum into a social convening space mixed with knowledge\". Continuing, he praised the collections, saying they are \"cultural assets [... Scotland is] turning those into real cultural capital\", and the museum is, and museums in general are, providing a sense of \"social pride\".\nThe guided tour.\nMcNeil joined the yellow group on a guided tour round the museum with one of the staff. Climbing the stairs at the rear of the Entrance Hall, the foot of the Window on the World exhibit, the group gained a first chance to see the restored Grand Gallery. This space is flooded with light from the glass ceiling three floors above, supported by 40 cast-iron columns. As may disappoint some visitors, the fish ponds have been removed; these were not an original feature, but originally installed in the 1960s \u2013 supposedly to humidify the museum; and failing in this regard. But, several curators joked that they attracted attention as \"the only thing that moved\" in the museum.\nThe museum's original architect was Captain , also responsible for the design of London's ; his design for the then-Industrial Museum apparently inspired by 's .\nThe group moved from the Grand Gallery into the Discoveries Gallery to the south side of the museum. The old red staircase is gone, and the Millennium Clock stands to the right of a newly-installed escalator, giving easier access to the upper galleries than the original staircases at each end of the Grand Gallery. Two glass elevators have also been installed, flanking the opening into the Discoveries Gallery and, providing disabled access from top-to-bottom of the museum.\nHistory of the Museum.\nThe National Museum of Scotland's origins can be traced back to 1780 when the 11th Earl of Buchan, David Stuart Erskine, formed the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland; the Society being tasked with the collection and preservation of archaeological artefacts for Scotland. In 1858, control of this was passed to the government of the day and the National Museum of Antiquities of Scotland came into being. Items in the collection at that time were housed at various locations around the city.\nOn Wednesday, October 28, 1861, during a royal visit to Edinburgh by , Prince-Consort laid the foundation-stone for what was then intended to be the Industrial Museum. Nearly five years later, it was the second son of Victoria and Albert, , the then-, who opened the building which was then known as the Scottish Museum of Science and Art. A full-page feature, published in the following Monday's issue of \"\" covered the history leading up to the opening of the museum, those who had championed its establishment, the building of the collection which it was to house, and 's donation of their collection to augment the exhibits put on public display.\nThe renovation.\nClosed for a little over three years, today's reopening of the museum is seen as the \"centrepiece\" of National Museums Scotland's fifteen-year plan to dramatically improve accessibility and better present their collections. Sir Andrew Grossard, chair of the Board of Trustees, said: \"The reopening of the National Museum of Scotland, on time and within budget is a tremendous achievement [...] Our collections tell great stories about the world, how Scots saw that world, and the disproportionate impact they had upon it. The intellectual and collecting impact of the Scottish diaspora has been profound. It is an inspiring story which has captured the imagination of our many supporters who have helped us achieve our aspirations and to whom we are profoundly grateful.\"\nThe extensive work, carried out with a view to expand publicly accessible space and display more of the museums collections, carried a \u00a347.4 million pricetag. This was jointly funded with \u00a316 million from the Scottish Government, and \u00a317.8 million from the . Further funds towards the work came from private sources and totalled \u00a313.6 million. Subsequent development, as part of the longer-term \u00a370 million \"Masterplan\", is expected to be completed by 2020 and see an additional eleven galleries opened.\nThe funding by the Scottish Government can be seen as a 'canny' investment; a report commissioned by National Museums Scotland, and produced by consultancy firm Biggar Economics, suggest the work carried out could be worth \u00a358.1 million per year, compared with an estimated value to the economy of \u00a348.8 prior to the 2008 closure. Visitor figures are expected to rise by over 20%; use of function facilities are predicted to increase, alongside other increases in local hospitality-sector spending.\nProudly commenting on the Scottish Government's involvement , Cabinet Secretary for Culture and External Affairs, described the reopening as, \"\"one of the nation\u2019s cultural highlights of 2011\" and says the rejuvenated museum is, \"[a] must-see attraction for local and international visitors alike\". Continuing to extol the museum's virtues, Hyslop states that it \"promotes the best of Scotland and our contributions to the world.\"\"\nSo-far, the work carried out is estimated to have increased the public space within the museum complex by 50%. Street-level storage rooms, never before seen by the public, have been transformed into new exhibit space, and pavement-level access to the buildings provided which include a new set of visitor facilities. Architectural firm Gareth Hoskins have retained the original Grand Gallery \u2013 now the first floor of the museum \u2013 described as a \"birdcage\" structure and originally inspired by built in for the 1851 .\nThe centrepiece in the Grand Gallery is the \"Window on the World\" exhibit, which stands around 20 metres tall and is currently one of the largest installations in any UK museum. This showcases numerous items from the museum's collections, rising through four storeys in the centre of the museum. Alexander Hayward, the museums Keeper of Science and Technology, challenged attending journalists to imagine installing \"teapots at thirty feet\".\nGalleries and exhibits.\nThe redeveloped museum includes the opening of sixteen brand new galleries. Housed within, are over 8,000 objects, only 20% of which have been previously seen.\nThe Window on the World rises through the four floors of the museum and contains over 800 objects. This includes a gyrocopter from the 1930s, the world's largest \u2013 made from the jaws of a sperm whale which the University of Edinburgh requested for their collection, a number of figures, spearheads, antique tools, an old gramophone and record, a selection of old local signage, and a girder from the .\nThe World Cultures Galleries.\nThe arrangement of galleries around the Grand Gallery's \"birdcage\" structure is organised into themes across multiple floors. The World Cultures Galleries allow visitors to explore the culture of the entire planet; Living Lands explains the ways in which our natural environment influences the way we live our lives, and the beliefs that grow out of the places we live - from the cold of North America to Australia's deserts.\nThe adjacent Patterns of Life gallery shows objects ranging from the everyday, to the unusual from all over the world. The functions different objects serve at different periods in peoples' lives are explored, and complement the contents of the Living Lands gallery.\nPerformance &amp; Lives houses musical instruments from around the world, alongside masks and costumes; both rooted in long-established traditions and rituals, this displayed alongside contemporary items showing the interpretation of tradition by contemporary artists and instrument-creators.\nThe museum proudly bills the Facing the Sea gallery as the only one in the UK which is specifically based on the cultures of the . It explores the rich diversity of the communities in the region, how the sea shapes the islanders' lives \u2013 describing how their lives are shaped as much by the sea as the land.\nBoth the \"Facing the Sea\" and \"Performance &amp; Lives\" galleries are on the second floor, next to the new exhibition shop and foyer which leads to one of the new exhibition galleries, expected to house the visiting \"Amazing Mummies\" exhibit in February, coming from in the Netherlands.\nThe Inspired by Nature, Artistic Legacies, and Traditions in Sculpture galleries take up most of the east side of the upper floor of the museum. The latter of these shows the sculptors from diverse cultures have, through history, explored the possibilities in expressing oneself using metal, wood, or stone. The \"Inspired by Nature\" gallery shows how many artists, including contemporary ones, draw their influence from the world around us \u2013 often commenting on our own human impact on that natural world.\nContrastingly, the \"Artistic Legacies\" gallery compares more traditional art and the work of modern artists. The displayed exhibits attempt to show how people, in creating specific art objects, attempt to illustrate the human spirit, the cultures they are familiar with, and the imaginative input of the objects' creators.\nThe Natural World Galleries.\nThe easternmost side of the museum, adjacent to Edinburgh University's Old College, will bring back memories for many regular visitors to the museum; but, with an extensive array of new items. The museum's dedicated taxidermy staff have produced a wide variety of fresh examples from the natural world.\nAt ground level, the Animal World and Wildlife Panorama's most imposing exhibit is probably the lifesize reproduction of a Tyrannosaurus Rex skeleton. This rubs shoulders with other examples from around the world, including one of a pair of elephants. The on-display elephant could not be removed whilst renovation work was underway, and lurked in a corner of the gallery as work went on around it.\nAbove, in the Animal Senses gallery, are examples of how we experience the world through our senses, and contrasting examples of wildly differing senses, or extremes of such, present in the natural world. This gallery also has giant screens, suspended in the free space, which show footage ranging from the most tranquil and peaceful life in the sea to the tooth-and-claw bloody savagery of nature.\nThe Survival gallery gives visitors a look into the ever-ongoing nature of evolution; the causes of some species dying out while others thrive, and the ability of any species to adapt as a method of avoiding extinction.\nEarth in Space puts our place in the universe in perspective. Housing Europe's oldest surviving , dating from the eleventh century, this gallery gives an opportunity to see the technology invented to allow us to look into the big questions about what lies beyond Earth, and probe the origins of the universe and life.\nIn contrast, the Restless Earth gallery shows examples of the rocks and minerals formed through geological processes here on earth. The continual processes of the planet are explored alongside their impact on human life. An impressive collection of geological specimens are complemented with educational multimedia presentations.\nThe more familiar, the \"Refreshed Galleries\".\nBeyond working on new galleries, and the main redevelopment, the transformation team have revamped galleries that will be familiar to regular past visitors to the museum.\nFormerly known as the \"Ivy Wu Gallery of East Asian Art\", the Looking East gallery showcases National Museums Scotland's extensive collection of , Chinese, and Japanese material. The gallery's creation was originally sponsored by Sir , and named after his wife Ivy. It contains items from the last dynasty, the , and examples of traditional ceramic work. Japan is represented through artefacts from ordinary people's lives, expositions on the role of the , and early trade with the West. Korean objects also show the country's ceramic work, clothing, and traditional accessories used, and worn, by the indigenous people.\nThe Ancient Egypt gallery has always been a favourite of visitors to the museum. A great many of the exhibits in this space were returned to Scotland from late 19th century excavations; and, are arranged to take visitors through the rituals, and objects associated with, life, death, and the afterlife, as viewed from an Egyptian perspective.\nThe Art and Industry and European Styles galleries, respectively, show how designs are arrived at and turned into manufactured objects, and the evolution of European style \u2013 financed and sponsored by a wide range of artists and patrons. A large number of the objects on display, often purchased or commissioned, by Scots, are now on display for the first time ever.\nShaping our World encourages visitors to take a fresh look at technological objects developed over the last 200 years, many of which are so integrated into our lives that they are taken for granted. Radio, transportation, and modern medicines are covered, with a retrospective on the people who developed many of the items we rely on daily.\nThe Scottish Galleries.\nWhat was known as the Museum of Scotland, a modern addition to the classical Victorian-era museum, is now known as the Scottish Galleries following the renovation of the main building.\nThis dedicated newer wing to the now-integrated National Museum of Scotland covers the history of Scotland from a time before there were people living in the country. The geological timescale is covered in the Beginnings gallery, showing continents arranging themselves into what people today see as familiar outlines on modern-day maps.\nJust next door, the history of the earliest occupants of Scotland are on display; hunters and gatherers from around 4,000 B.C give way to farmers in the Early People exhibits.\nThe Kingdom of the Scots follows Scotland becoming a recognisable nation, and a kingdom ruled over by the Stewart dynasty. Moving closer to modern-times, the Scotland Transformed gallery looks at the country's history post-union in 1707.\nIndustry and Empire showcases Scotland's significant place in the world as a source of heavy engineering work in the form of rail engineering and shipbuilding \u2013 key components in the building of the . Naturally, whisky was another globally-recognised export introduced to the world during empire-building.\nLastly, Scotland: A Changing Nation collects less-tangible items, including personal accounts, from the country's journey through the 20th century; the social history of Scots, and progress towards being a multicultural nation, is explored through heavy use of multimedia exhibits."}

It also finds boys who masturbate are more likely to engage in safe sex than boys who don't. \nDr. Cynthia L. Robbins, the study's lead author from , spoke of the need for the academic community to focus more on masturbation. \"Many adolescent boys and girls masturbate, and among sexually active teens masturbation is associated with other sexual behaviors and condom use. It is important to recognize that masturbation is an important and normal component of adolescent sexual development.\"\nThe survey, named the National Survey of Sexual Health and Behavior (NSSHB), was supported by , which makes condoms. A representative nationwide sample of 820 teens 14\u201317 years old participated in the study with parental permission. The findings were published Monday in the \"Archives of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine\".\nMale and female respondents were asked to note how frequently they masturbated in the past three months, the past year, and throughout their lifetime. They were also asked to recall whether they masturbated alone or with a partner, and also how often they used condoms. \nNearly three-fourths of boys reported having masturbated, compared to only less than half of girls. About half of boys reported masturbating twice or more per week, also higher than the 23 percent of girls. Masturbation rates for both genders increased along with age, though only boys were more likely to report having \"recently\" engaged in the activity as they grew older. \nAmong adolescents who engage in oral or vaginal sex, boys who masturbate were eight times more likely to use a condom than boys who don't. A similar correlation was not observed for girls. \nThe researchers who conducted the study urge more open and educational discussion of this highly stigmatized topic. \"The findings of this study together with existing publications on masturbation should be used by health care providers to inform, educate and reassure adolescents about masturbation to provide competent and comprehensive sexuality education in the clinical setting\"."}

At the age of 22 years and 6 months she is the youngest professional golfer of either gender to earn . Her final round of 69 allowed her to overcome a two shot deficit to third round leader of Germany and finish with a four shot cushion over runner-up of USA.\nThe Ricoh is one of four designated major championships on the and the final such tournament on the .\nFirst round.\nKorean led the first round, played on Thursday, July 28, with a score of 65. The 29-year-old Lee, a two time winner on the LPGA Tour, hit seven birdies and no bogeys despite playing in the worst weather of the day. Constant rain did not seem to disrupt her game as other players struggled.\nShe started her round by making a birdie at the very first hole. She followed with birdies on all three par five holes and on the par four seventh, ninth, and short 11th holes. On the last hole she got a lucky break when her badly-hit approach shot fell short, and jumped across the Barry Burn to stop three feet from the hole; she missed her birdie chance.\nTwo shots behind Lee was 2009 Kraft Nabisco Championship winner of the US. The American started her round much earlier than the eventual leader and took advantage of more favorable weather conditions. She was at even par after 11 holes with two birdies and two bogeys but things turned for the better and she made two consecutive birdies followed by an eagle on the 14th hole. Lincicome hit another on the 17th hole to seal her final score.\nAnother shot behind were four players - 2000 champion of Sweden, Germany's Caroline Massson, American , and of South Korea. Defending champion and World Ranked Number 1 Yani Tseng of Taiwan was three shots back at one-under-par.\nSecond round.\nSecond round headlines belonged to the 22-year-old Caroline Masson, ranked 141st in the world. The native of Germany, who turned professional at the end of 2009 and plays on the Ladies European Tour, shot a bogey-free round of 65 to lead the championship after two rounds. Her total score of 11-under-par (133) was the lowest halfway result in the event's history.\nMasson, who was tied for third after the first round, took advantage of the benign sunny conditions while playing in the last group on Friday. She went out in 32 making birdies at the 3rd, 6th, 7th, and 9th holes. On the par three 13th hole she added another birdie. On the 15th she went one shot better and almost eagled the par five 17th after hitting the green in two. During the post-round press conference she stated that one of the keys to her good score was work on a low ball flight, suitable for links courses. Masson's swing coach is G\u00fcnter Kessler, who also works with her fellow countryman golfer .\nOne shot behind Masson were two Korean players, overnight leader Meena Lee and . Lee, playing in a group preceding Masson's, could not repeat her Thursday performance and hit just five birdies and two bogeys for a round of 69.\nPark, on her way to a second place finish, shot the day's best round of 64, matched only by her compatriot and , champion who was tied for third place.\nDefending champion Yani Tseng made a jump up the leaderboard after posting a round of six-under. Tseng's total score of 137 gave her a 7th place position, four shots behind the leader.\nOf the 144 players who started the tournament, 68 made the cut which was set at +1. Notables not playing the weekend included Japan's and England's .\nThird round.\nOn Saturday Masson continued to shine over the Carnoustie course. Her first hole, however, put a question mark on whether she would hold on to the leader's position. Her tee shot found the right rough and although she hit the green with her second, she three-putted for a bogey five. She quickly bounced back with a birdie on the second hole as she placed her approach shot within two metres from the pin. She followed with two consecutive birdies on the 5th and 6th holes, added another on the short 11th, and then birdied two remaining par fives 14th and 17th. She closed with a bogey on the last as her approach shot found the front right greenside bunker and she could not get up-and-down from there.\nHer playing partner, Inbee Park, struggled to repeat her Round 2 score and shot 73 to drop into a shared third position.\nThe best round of the day belonged to the defending champion Yani Tseng as she shot 6-under 66 to climb into second place, two shots behind Masson. She carded five birdies, a solitary bogey on the 7th, and holed a 23-yard eagle putt on the 14th.\nThe highest placed British player and a local favorite was the 2009 champion from , . Her bogey-free round of 68 tied her for third.\nFinal round.\nThe start to the final round was the opposite of what followed later in the day. Both Masson and Tseng found the green with their second shots, but it was the Rolex Ranking number one, Tseng, who made the first mistake, three-putting for a bogey. Then the fortune reversed as the German struggled with her shots and the putter while Tseng made birdies.\nMasson's three-shot advantage after the first melted after another two holes \u2013 she three-putted the 2nd and did not get up-and-down after missing the green on the 3rd, while Tseng made a birdie on the third hole. Tseng jumped into the lead after a birdie on the par five 6th, where her pitch onto the green left her with an easy putt. Masson then went on to bogey the 7th.\nTheir scores did not change until the German bogeyed the 10th and 11th, and double-bogeyed the 12th, which essentially dropped her out of contention.\nTseng, meanwhile, birdied the 11th to increase her lead over the rest of the field. Two dropped shots on the 12th and 13th, however, closed the gap to just two shots over the chasing Catriona Matthew, who was 11-under after nine holes. From then, there were no more mistakes for the leader as she birdied par fives 14th and 17th, and closed with a birdie at the 18th for a round of 16-under.\nFor Tseng it was the second season in a row in which she has won two major championship titles; in June she won the LPGA Championship title.\nCatriona Matthew, despite being second at some point during the Sunday's round finished with a double bogey at the last. A total score of nine-under gave her a fifth place finish alongside Caroline Masson, who shot 78, including birdies at the last two holes.\nRunner-up place, four shots behind Tseng, was American who shot a final round of 67.\nBest round of the day, 8-under 64, belonged to another native of the US, . She made just a single birdie on the first nine, but then with five birdies and an eagle on the 14th, scored 29 going home, the lowest nine-hole result on LPGA Tour this season.\nOf the two amateurs who made it to the weekend, American earned the honours of the best amateur player and received the Smyth Salver trophy given to the lowest-scoring non-professional."}

The Bureau d'Enqu\u00eates et d'Analyses (BEA) is being accused of trying to blame the pilots in order to absolve Airbus.\nThe controversy follows the release of the BEA's latest interim report detailing findings so far. At the last moment, the BEA removed a recommendation added by chief investigator Alain Bouillard which called for alarms on s to be modified. \nThe National Airline Pilots Union (SNPL) is concerned the investigation is degenerating \"into a simple charge sheet against the crew,\" and says the latest revelations left them with \"seriously damaged\" faith in the investigators. The SNPL has withdrawn all support in the probe. Air France claim alarms on the A330-200 were \"misleading\" and contributed to the disaster. Robert Soulas, president of French victims' families group Entraide et Solidarit\u00e9 AF447, claims the move proves bias in the BEA.\nThe dispute surrounds stall warning systems. An aircraft stalls if it no longer has sufficient speed to keep itself airbourne. The warnings cut out at extremely low speeds, meaning if a stall progresses far enough the warning can cease. The correct course of action in a stall is to lower the nose, increasing an aircraft's speed; if the speed increases, the warnings can sound again. This may confuse pilots into abandoning corrective measures.\nThe BEA have responded that the last-minute call to remove a recommendation calling for changes to stall warning design was owing to a need to examine the issue further. They say behavioral psychologists and cockpit designers have been teamed up to look into the warnings and how crews respond to them. The BEA intends to make a recommendation on the issue in the future, and a spokesperson expressed \"deep regret\" at the SNPL's response.\nFriday's 117-page report did examine the actions and training of the pilots. The report says they were untrained in high-altitude manual flying and in how to identify and react to failures of speed sensors. Neither was a standard part of training at the time. \nThe failed, causing the autopilot and to switch off.

Air France previously upgraded the speed sensors on their A330s.\nJunior Transport Minister defended the BEA. \"There has never been such a transparent enquiry: it was filmed, took place under the judiciary's control, with Brazilian [and] American investigators. These controversies discredit an enquiry that is exemplary.\" Airbus also responded. \"Can you imagine for an instant that, because of economic interests or links between the BEA and Airbus, we'd put in peril all the other airlines operating this plane? It's neither conceivable nor admissible,\" said a statement. About 180 airlines use the Airbus A330. "}
