This is proven in many real world implementations to reduce the abortion rate by upwards of in the first year and more as time passes.But the forced birthers arent supporting programs like that. In fact in Colorado where such a program existed funded for the first few years by private funds which ran out the forced birth faction actively campaigned AGAINST continuing the program with tax dollars.When I ask forced birth advocates about this they almost inevitably reply either that they dont believe their tax dollars should subsidize someone elses sex life or that they believe it is immoral to have sex outside marriage and that its certainly immoral for teenagers to have sex.The problem here and the reason why this leads me to think they dont really believe abortion is murder is that this means theyre prioritizing their own taxeconomic beliefs above saving babies or that theyre prioritizing their discomfort with people having sex in ways they dont like above saving babies.It isnt just that they have to prioritize its that they have prioritized. Perhaps not in a deliberate step by step conscious process but they have at least subconsciously prioritized their own tax or moral beliefs above killing babies.Im forced to conclude that either theyre monsters who but a monster would argue that their tax policy is worth murdering babies or that theyre not being honest about their belief that abortion is murder.If as they argue abortion is murder and that therefore it is worth sacrificing womens bodily autonomy to prevent it then surely it follows that if abortion is murder its worth them sacrificing a few tax dollars or a bit of squik on their part.',\n  'label': []},\n 't3_2e6v25': {'argument': 'Reference Article I dont buy into the idea that the president should never play golf or relax in any way.

These increases in food production were made possible by a string of innovations and increases in productivity through technological and methodological advances in farming like crop rotation better plowing tools use of animal labour use of manure as fertilizer breeding of crops and livestock chemically produced fertilizers and pesticides and as of late genetic modification of crops.Today is the first time in recorded history that we deliberately use farming methods that decrease output under the moniker of organic food production. I believe that the desire for organic food production is a symptom of rich and saturated societies and is what we here know as a first world problem. This desire has the potential to compromise the global food output if it becomes more widespread and increase the number of people living in hunger and dying from starvation.I dont contest that chemically produced fertilizers and pesticides and GMO crops must be used carefully and in measured amounts to get the riskbenefit balance right and yes there are risks hazards and dangers associated with them. I dont contest either that early pesticides were rather poisonous and at times did more harm than good especially when used naively.However science and engineering progress all the time pesticides become better more specific fertilizers become better to handle cheaper and less energyintensive to produce GMO crops continue what breeding programs have done in the past that is improve a plant species for more and potentially healthier output with equal production cost.And thus I believe that organic food production is a dangerous fad and that to increase food output and eradicate hunger and malnutriton we must use and improve industrial farming methods using and improving all means available to us intelligently and wisely and without the prejudice of labelling something that came out of a chemical plant as bad while labelling something that came out of a cows arse as somehow magically good and instead have a sane costbenefit analysis that takes into account all that is availabe to us.Quite simply we must not throw away much of the food production techniques what served us well the last couple of hundred years because that could kill a large portion of humans alive today.Change my view.',\n  'label': 'Organic food'},\n {'id': 't3_4oh27m',\n  'argument': '.

This is obviously not to say that there is no longer rock music being made that that music is never popular or that that contemporary rock music isnt good. But rock has become similar to jazz and classicalwhile there is still lots of it being made its not a powerful cultural force any more. The modern cultural conversation is being played out in hiphop and EDM.Of the current Top on the Billboard charts the only rock single is Shut Up and Dance by Walk the Moon at and that song is heavily influenced by EDM. The current Song of the Summer is generally agreed to be Fetty Waps Trap Queen. The most consistently popular rock band currently is probably either the Foo Fighters a band that has been around since the late s and still plays a very similar style of music to what they were playing then and arguably still owe a large portion of their popularity to nostalgia for Nirvana a band whose largest cultural moment was years ago or the Black Keys a band playing with a deliberately retro style.',\n  'label': \"Guns N' Roses\"},\n {'id': 't3_3gqfnu',\n  'argument': 'I am Canadian but I think this applies to all of North America.

Another website here states that the ... equivalent to . of total global oil production and of OECD oil consumption comes from there.The Middle East is also a warriddled area riddled with conflict and nonwesternfriendly ideologies and beliefs. When the day comes that the western world moves to renewable energy cars such as hydrogen fuel cells which are set to become a lot more common when the technology catches up income to these countries will plummet and their main export will become useless.
