However Purchasing meat from farms known to produce their meat in an ethical way not only denies demand to large factory farms but helps improve the market share of ethical meatgrowing which seems as though it would be even better for animal welfare.My general view is that people should probably as a rule eat less meat from better growers and that will make for a bigger shift in growing practices than simply people dropping out of eating meat altogether.

I understand why politics use this slogan because they are trying to get americans to vote for them but this slogan is also prominent in ads made by private corporations. As if creating jobs for americans is morally superior to creating jobs for people of other countries.',\n 'Because of the anonymity on chan people are more prone to not think through care about what they post and are quicker to throw out insults. They will care about how people respond to them but since its largely negative they will stoop down to the same level rather than go to any high ground since they are not linked to an identity.Surrounding the entire site theres a general pessimistic group mentality and people are subconsciously encouraged to take part of it in order to feel like they are a part of the group. Some boards will have specific groups of people who they are encouraged to hate women SJWs casual gamers Jews and any reasonable argument against a poster can be made redundant by saying or thinking they are a part of these agendas or groups.On boards you will find echo chambers where people are more prone to believe rumors than proof.

As long as the worker is getting their job done how they dress should be completely irrelevant so long as they arent distracting or offending other people at the office.To head off some arguments I dont believe that wearing a collared shirt and pants that arent jeans are representative that you respect the job any more than I believe that sweatpants and a tshirt are signs that you disrespect the job.What I think would change my view would be any sort of evidence that theres a benefit to having a workplace full of programmers or a call center always wearing slacks or skirts and nice tops.',\n 'Okay so this is an argument I have all the time being a teenager myself . usually what happens is Ill be discussing a topic with an adult usually a family member or teacher then we disagree then they say something that infuriates me like oh I thought the same thing when I was your age or youll grow out of it. even online there is this annoying stigma that all teens are idiots but at the same time think they know everything. sometimes it makes sense. some subjects obviously require experience. Relationship advice for example. Ive never been in a relationship so if I were to try and give an adult or anyone for that matter relationship advice it would make sense to tell me youre too youngyour opinion will changeyoull grow out of it. but when arguing about politics religion or any subject that really doesnt require experience to understand it better saying something like youre just a teen or I used to think like that is an excuse and it usually means you have nothing more to say but arent willing to lose this discussion to a stupid teen. personally Im unsurprisingly an atheist.

For example Thats so gay and You throw like a girl type insults. Many people come to the conclusion that these type of insults are homophobic and misogynistic but I dont believe thats necessarily the case at all.I think the most insulting thing about being called a girl for a boy is the affront to his own identity. He is being called something he is not. He doesnt think its insulting because he hates girls and thinks theyre inferior but rather because his identity as a boy is being taken away.Women in general also hate being associated with masculinity.',\n 'First let me clarify that antifeminism isnt necessarily antiwomens rights but against the belief in the patriarchy and institutional misogyny. Feminists often try to silence womens criticisms of feminism by saying they have internalized misogyny. I dont believe this is the case. A lack of belief in the patriarchy can be caused by the lack of empirical evidence. Examples of misogyny and discrimination dont have to be ignored or excused as one with internalized misogyny would be expected to do because they do not necessarily prove the existence of a patriarchy nor institutional misogyny.',\n 'My logic basically stems from the idea of If you cant afford to have child you cant have a child. Let me explain.In my opinion if one parent wants to keep the child and the other doesnt then unless they can be proven unfit for parenting this includes financial instability then good for them go for it. The only time I could see child support being necessary is if they parent needs the extra money to support their children. But Im sorry you cant have a child if you cant support it and you sure as hell cant take the money from someone else regardless of their involvement in the childs creation. Obviously its a different story if they are splitting custody then an arrangement should be made about how the money should be split.If only the mother wants the child then she can have it and raise it by herself or with whomever she wants.If only the father wants the child then its up to the mother if she wants to have it and the forfeit custody to him after birth.',\n 'Many times in my life I have been helped out by a neighbor or business owner who left an unsecured or nopassword WiFi network.

Although there are horror stories about people being SWATted by those on their WiFi network I dont think the risks of that are statistically much higher than many other technology risks including using a guessable password like or browsing the Internet on library or Starbucks WiFi.

I also understand the underlying arguments for a man being on the hook for child support. However I believe that these arguments clash against each other and I feel that men should either be able to waive their financial obligations to their child or they should partake in the decision for the woman to get an abortion.Women should be the decision maker when it comes to getting an abortion because they should have control of their own bodiesThis is a perfectly valid point. In this argument the fetus is being treated as a part of the womans body and therefore the woman is free to make decisions without consideration for the wellbeing of the fetus and its future.Men should be on the hook for child support because we shouldnt be focused on the parents but rather the wellbeing of the childThis also makes perfect sense. Even if the parents are arguing the needs of the parents shouldnt be placed before the needs of the child.However if we take the argument that women should have control of their own bodies without consideration for the future of their fetus then it should also be right to say that men should have control of their own life without consideration for the future of their fetus.If we take the argument that the wellbeing of the child should come before the wellbeing of the parents then I also think that it is fair to say that a woman should not freely be able to choose whether to get an abortion without consideration for the wellbeing of the childs future.I find it extremely unfair that a woman who cannot financially or emotionally support a child has the right to have a kid because she has a right to control her own body but when it comes to men their life savings can be forcefully taken away because the future of the child should be placed before the rights of a man.Therefore I believe that men should either have abortion rights or the right to waive all financial obligations to his child while abortion is still an option.Note Im not trying to make this into a male vs. female thing.',\n 'Think about it.

It would be better to break it down further so that they are taxed on the first k on the next k and on the next k. Tax rate should be increased bit by bit as someones salary increases rather than having big jumps in tax rate. With a single formula there are no jumps and this leads to a fairer tax system.Heres a graph of a function which I came up with the very rich pay tax on their salary and those earning pay tax.

A deterrent isnt going to stop a heroin addict from getting his fix and overcoming withdrawal youve just changed where he gets it from and how much it costs and the risks associated with it. The user now has to go to a sketchy dealer the dealer has many tiers of other sketchy dealers all the way up to the cartel behind it all and that cartel is arguably more destructive than the drug itself and so is the war against the drug.Making abortion illegal isnt going to stop women from wanting an abortion youve just made it much less likely for them to get it done safely.

There are few if any changes in gameplay and the basic level design for the most part remains the same. Even Advanced Warfare which seemed to promise the most novel changes was criticized for changing too little from its preceding games.Another reason for my opinion is that CoD doesnt really have anything astoundingly different from other games of the same genre.

This situation would be further facilitated by the fact that the density of the universe is low in a heat death scenario as such it would be difficult for the machine to increase entropy via interactions with the environment.

A car or a paper towel has attributes than can be discussed in a commerical in a way that the consumer can understand. They use commericals to inform consumers as to why the product is a better choice than the competition by discussing what is done differently. Medicine is not marketed by talking about what chemicals are in it relative to the competition rather they show clips of patients enjoying life while listing a crapload of deadly side effects. Yes it is true that many products are marketed by showing the viewer shots of a general lifestyle that does not really pertain to the product but the difference is that medicine is far more complicated and can do far more harm to a person if purchased hastily than something like gum or a coffee machine.',\n 'The real problem is the concept of marriage itself. In my view LGBT couples are already married regardless of the legislation that is imposed on them. Marriage isnt a set of civil rights that confirms your connection to your partner its the choice you make to be in private daily lifelong commitment to another being.Tradition dictates that in order to be properly married you have to exchange vows get a ring and have a massive celebration the set of traditions change based upon the culture.

In addition admins should ban subreddits that promote violence against women such as rtheredpill and rbeatingwomen.I can anticipate a lot of the responses Ill get so Ill address some counterarguments right now.This allows the admins to abuse their power and ban nonracistsexistprejudice subreddits.I believe that in order for reddit to ban a subreddit they should have to explain why it was banned and give evidence that it was promoting hate speech.This censors free speech.Reddit is a private company that can do whatever they want legally.

I wanted to spread the peanut butter first but I realized that by spreading peanut butter and then using the same knife in the jelly I would be adding peanuts to the jelly.

Resisting arrest is currently a felony offense in multiple states USA.. but anecdotally the charge is used to basically trump up the offenses committed by the perp. For those of you who are unaware it is still a felonyagainst the law to resist an unlawful arrest meaning that as a citizen obeying the law in a circumstance which gives the police officer no legal grounds to arrest you...they can still arrest you and you arent even allowed to flinch.I think this practice is toxic to our society. Psychologically and physiologically our first reaction to aggressive actions is defense so resisting arrest statutes are legally punishing citizens for their natural instincts. Now Im not saying civilians should be allowed to resist with deadly force or even excessive force but there needs to be some protection for civilians resisting in a reasonable fashion.',\n 'I first learned about evolution as a young child.

While I get that these people are coming from a good place I dont think its the right thing to do for the following reasons.Its ultimately very condescending.

If they were fulfilling that purpose we would expect at least a few percent of the cases they hear to not pass the test. However according to fivethirtyeight.comSo theyre obviously a rubber stamp court doing what the prosecutors want them to do.Since they dont fulfill their positive purpose forcing the state to bring a good case and they do seem to fulfill a rather negative one protecting government agents from prosecution I think we should get rid of them.',\n 'I dont want to believe this Ive tried to find a good counterargument but this is how I feel.

Hell I sometimes get it wrong when Im not paying enough attention especially when it gets back into less recent history English speakers know automatically that th century and th century refer to s and s but how many of us automatically make the shift when we hear th century?The only issue I can see is that when discussing Romanera history around the time BC AD it might make referring to the st Century AD a little more difficult.

That an absolute pacifist relies on others to commit violence for their own continued safety for example the subduing of a dangerous criminal by police forces may be violent and that any personal code which requires other persons to break said code in order to be followed cannot be moral.

WSDOT did a study on this and they found that roundabouts had less fatalities than traffic lights.Roundabouts also allow traffic to move more quickly than way stops according to mythbusters.tldr Roundabouts are safer more efficient for maintaining inertia faster cheaper. They are better for drivers as well as tax payers.',\n 'NOTE those is not the stereotypical whiny Im a nice guy why dont girls like me post. I used to be one of those guys but I am not anymore.

A simplified version of this theory because of the last item is conservatives are motivated by disgust reactions.My point is the problem is that Haidts methodology is flawed because he assumed the same things will effect a disgust reaction in liberals and conservatives. It is not true. His questions are too much conservative focused e.g. desecrating a flag. Liberals are simply disgusted by different things for example desecreating knowledge burning books or libraries.I think liberals feel more disgust over violence and blood for example.',\n 'This includes any sort of welfare assistance health care etc. I honestly dont care if they come to America or not.

From what I understand seeking psychiatric help is voluntary and requires will on the side of the patient to decide whether he or she wantsneeds to seek help. However other medical illnesses arent treated this way if you go to the doctor for a routine checkup and your cholesterol is high the doctor will attempt to intervene and the patient is expected to take the doctors advice.

However I just started a job at an anesthesiologist billing office that uses a company in India to do their data entry a LOT of anesthesiologists use our service so theres a lot of data entry and it got me thinking that theres nothing actually wrong with outsourcing aside from just the potential poor quality but my work really benefits from it and they do a good job.

Its probably not appropriate for your TV interviews as a representative of the scientists that just put a rover on a comet but again your choices are yours.

The karma system allows one group to impose their beliefs on another with a whose side has more people who believe in this kind of numbers game.

Based on the fact that we used to be cave men and women and men would typically have multiple partners in order to pass their lineage on I believe that while we have clearly evolved from that biology has still framed us to struggle with monogamy.

He was born male and his sex change was the result of a botched circumcision. He then suffered bizarre forms of socalled therapy that included a doctor forcing him and his twin brother to rehearse sexual acts. We can all agree this whole situation is fucked up and should serve as a lesson for all medical professionals.

When I was introduced to the PUA community years ago and eventually TRP a few months ago it was the first time in my life I was given helpful advice on how to become someone who can actually make it in todays society in terms of being socialsexual. Those communities taught me about confidence staying true to myselfself embracing my sexuality and most of all become the best version of myself and aim for the stars in a way that is actually applicable to the real world and not in the form of some cliched advice that people oblivious to those concepts could possibly grasp and implement.I do agree with a lot of statements regarding TRP making generalizations about women to a point of dehumanizing them.',\n 'A few weeks ago a woman who was formerly a Baltimore Ravens cheerleader was arrested for rape after allegedly having sexual relations with a yearold boy. This story is not all that unique as there are plenty of instances when older women often teachers have been arrested for having sex with males under the age of consent. And while I dont necessarily think that women in these cases should not be punished at all I think punishing them as much as older men who prey on young girls is also not appropriate.I dont think its a controversial statement to say that males are naturally more sexually aggressive and promiscuous than females. That is seen across cultures and even across species. Simply put men want sex more than women they just do.',\n 'Now with states starting to legalize marijuana a lot of people are saying that people who got jailed for smugglingusing marijuana should be release. I however disagree. Assuming that the law was a reasonable law that got removed because our society changed to such an extent that we no longer need the law the people who broke such a law should be jailed solely for the fact that they ignored the law.Examples of similar scenarios would be someone getting fined for driving on a road whos speed limit was but later the limit rose to . Or someone getting fined for jwalking on a place that later added a crosswalk. In those cases I think that most people would agree with me that those people should not get their money returned.In order for my view to be changed I would have to change my belief that solely for being a criminallaw breaker warrens you being punished',\n 'Whenever I read something in perfect columns I always hate coming across a word broken up by a hyphen just for the sake of having the column of words look nice and be all even.

The soldiers who gave their lives in that conflict can legitimately be seen as laying their lives down to oppose fascism and protect some basic institutions of human freedom.I do not believe the same can be said for the First World War.

Equality in the eyes of the law is in my opinion the single most important part of our society and in the current system the rich and the poor are not equal in the eyes of the law.The second part of my view is that a good solution to this problem is to require that both sides in a lawsuit or court case contribute equally to their own legal team and their opponents.

I understand people should be encouraged to understand the issue at hand and to research representatives however people who do not should not be encouraged to vote.

Not having child is objectively a great decision economically timewise etc.',\n 'Im not saying that U.S. democracy or any specific democracy is the best or better than any other other government but rather that democracy or the idea that every individual should matter and get a say through some kind of vote and that public officials should be held responsible for their actions with that vote is the best political system to date for preventing corruption and promoting social equality and liberty.Sure there is a nearly endless list of democracys shortcomings and failures and the U.S. is an especially good example of how tyranny and atrocity can continue or even worsen under a supposedly democratic government. However I believe these are offset and outnumbered by the tyranny and atrocities committed under nondemocratic governments.When I say this I mean that I believe comparing modern and past democracies to modern and past dictatorships and monarchies throughout history will yield the conclusion that the quality of life in a democracy is substantially better for most people and that as more people are given franchise the better and better it gets. Conversely if for example the U.S. had been a oneparty dictatorship for the past years atrocities such as chattel slavery genocide of indigenous peoples and unwarranted global intervention would be that much worse if imagining such is even possible.I want to clarify that I am using the U.S. as my main example because thats where I am also I think it is a good example of a particularly controversial example of democracy.I believe that one of the biggest problems with American democracy to date is the ambivelence people have towards democracy. Judging even just from the posts on this sub many are incredibly disappointed with democracy and will even go as far as to say it is obsolete or just a bad idea in the first place. When we stop having faith in democracy we stop having faith in the people and ourselves and necessarily cede our power to others.',\n 'Revenge porn can be extremely hurtful there is no doubt about that.

By allowing all eligible citizens to access firearms you neutralise this disadvantage women have. By preventing all eligible citizens from legally accessing firearms you have a disproportionate affect upon women.

I rarely see fat professional tennis players but I have seen a few somewhat overweight snooker and darts players.

I have spoken with a few people about this in the hopes that they would convince me that its ok to continue eating meat but so far the arguments have been entirely unconvincing.Id like to preemptively address some arguments that I do not find compelling..

If a procedure is expensive unavailable or illegal in a persons country of residence it could be anything from cosmetic surgery to various dental procedures to abortions and euthanasia an alternative is to fly to a country which provides the service under more desirable conditions. In my opinion government regulation of this industry constitutes a violation of personal liberty undermines the economic growth of the prospective destination countries and inflates the price of domestic healthcare by forcibly eliminating foreign competition.Examples of regulation include limiting travel to government approved zones countries etc limiting the kinds of treatment allowed e.g. banning certain procedures deemed to dangerous or perhaps banning travel for procedures which are illegal in the country like abortions or euthanasia making the buying of insurance to cover the procedure compulsory and so on.

Why should you only be allowed to dress as a character of your own ethnicity?Please remember I am only trying to find a reasonable explanation for this principle and am not trying to condone racial stereotyping or anything of the sort. If I am ignorant for asking this well at least I bothered to ask.',\n 'Now before I begin I want to make it clear that I am not the stereotypical sports jock who puts down nontraditional sports like cheerleading and marching band. I am currently in high school marching band and have never been good at any actual sports.A sport has always been a competitive activity that involves either individuals or teams competing against each other to win a game or match. Sports have clear winners that can be determined by either the amount of points an individual or team wins ex football soccer tennis etc. or which individual or team finishes first ex swim track etc..Therefore anything that cannot be determined to have a clear winner should not be considered a sport. Even if you dont accept this definition there is a clear difference between artistic activities and athletic activities. Athletic events require mostly physical fitness and coordination and have a clear winner.',\n 'By social contract I refer to the thought that individuals hold moral or political obligations toward each other and the state as a result of a shared contract that forms society.The premise of my argument is this I did not sign any social contract and until I consent to such a thought I hold no obligations to the society I am in at the time or the government that claims to represent them simply because I have a natural right to decide to not give my consent to something or not. This naturally means that government is illegitimate if it tries to rule me in any way. If I need to formulate a natural rights theory in this thread I can. I am not interested in a utilitarian argument for or against government and society. That does not get to the question Am I subject to a social contract against my consent?',\n 'Ive been doing this for years. Im at a healthy weight. My BMI is which in normal range.

Here are the reasons Im against itOften times if a subject is in custody their only source of information about whats going on is their lawyer and those interrogating them. It can be extremely difficult to deduce the truth for a suspect. Often times police officers lie to try and get the suspect to give up information or confess in hopes of lessening punishment or explaining their side of the story. My argument is that such lies also encourage the suspect to confess even if they didnt do it to try and lessen the punishment.',\n 'In short if the US government is willing to spend billions of dollars on defense and millions of Americans support this defense spending why do many of the same people fight so adamantly against the government paying for healthcare?A lot of us dont agree with defense spending myself included. A lot of this War on Terror has just proven to be an inconvenience for ordinary citizens just look at the TSA and what we have to deal with to get on board a plane. Others are blatant violations of privacy such as NSA surveillance.Some people disagree with how universal healthcare should be run and wouldnt support it with their hardearned dollars. But if a similar number of people dont support sending our troops abroad to fight wars that almost nobody has an interest in.To be clear I strongly support implementation of healthcare as it is executed in the Nordic countries and I advocate the Nordic model in general. Im not saying only socialist countries should have militaries but I do say that the implementation of national armed forces and healthcare are too similar from a purely economic perspective to support one and oppose the other.',\n 'I constantly hear about so called rape culture in regards to feminism. Im not convinced that rape culture exists in a significant way and I certainly dont believe that society is cultured to excuse rapists. To clarify I believe that rape culture hardly exists not that it doesnt exist at all. First of all sexual assault is punished severely. These long prison sentences are accepted by both men and women and I rarely see anyone contesting these punishments.',\n 'I think its likely that primitive societies that allowed women to have an equal or dominating say in political matters were probably out competed by patriarchal societies. In this sense patriarchy may be a natural tradition. This does not imply that patriarchy is good or justified though.The reason I think patriarchies outperformed matriarchies is that primitive societies were in no position to compensate for the potential distortions in judgement caused by the menstrual cycle of women. PMS in particular has unpredictable psychological consequences for women. On the average it seems likely that men would be more consistent decision makers than women.Although men do not have better judgement than women do on average a man of good judgement is more likely to be consistent than a woman of good judgement due to the psychological effects of the menstrual cycle on the woman.And to reiterate I am aiming at an explanation for patriarchy with reference to the efficient cause not at a justification for patriarchy.',\n 'For a long time I followed Ron Pauls reasoning on the war in Iraq that we were doing more harm than good and that bringing our troops home would reduce threats of terrorism and save us money in the long run.So we did that ISIS formed and terror threats are much greater than they were before. I still follow Ron Paul and his message has not changed whatsoever despite his assertion that leaving Iraq would be better for everyone.I think that the biggest mistake Ron Paul and libertarians in general made was assuming that leaving the middleeast would cause extremists to forgive us. The reason they hate us so much is not because we were over there but because we support Israel their number enemy. The libertarian answer to that is to simply stop funding and supporting Israel but I dont think that is a good idea especially on a moral level. People argue Israel is strong enough to defend itself but that is only because of all the military support we give them.',\n 'My boyfriend and I got into a debate about whether aliens are flying around our galaxy and solar system and entering our planet.I argued that if there were aliens flying around in outer space even if theyre not entering Earth we would have heard about them from scientists.

When both of those occur together you end up with a populace that hates and fears the police rather than trusting and respecting them.

The U.S NATO whoever would be willing to participate should implement and agency with funding comparable to NASA whos sole purpose is to plan for hostile alien threats. The NATO and the Soviet Union spent years planning how to nuke each other into the stone age and how to fight each other after that its not that big of a conceptual or technological leap to do something similar when facing an alien threat. It could includeA stockpile of nuclear tipped Delta IVs that could hit targets before they reach earth orbit.A continually evolving observation system that can detect objects across the solar system.A plan for resisting an almost inevitable occupation that would includedispersing weapons and special forces units maintaining a global communications network etc.It may seem crazy now but if we were to face an alien invasion our first response as a species would be to fire off all the nukes and head for our bomb shelters shouldnt we make plans ahead of time that would allows us to do that more efficiently?',\n 'Im in my late s.

Things like buying alcohol or tobacco applying for a job getting stopped by police all require photo ID. Yes in theory you could use a birth certificate or social security card as these are forms of ID but if the argument is that minorities or illegal immigrants are discriminated against then these things likely to be just as difficult.Since an ID is necessary in such events why shouldnt it be necessary in others? And if it shouldnt why is it necessary at all?

When Im in class at university and a fire alarm goes off which is usually a couple of times a semester no one takes it seriously. The professor finishes their last thought while everyone takes the time to neatly pack all of their stuff before exiting the building often using the main exit instead of the nearest emergency exit. Similarly at my dorm last year they would run unannounced fire drills as often as once a month it was so common and the odds of fire so low that generally people just assumed correctly that it wasnt real and sometimes didnt even leave their rooms. Back in high school there were fire drill quotas so if the school hadnt done any for a while they would end up having like three in one week although in fairness in high school the teacher and administration made sure everyone followed procedure so if there was a real fire it would not be a problem in this case but I still feel like it helps condition people to the fact that fire alarms are false alarms.',\n 'I believe the modern Libertarian as defined by people like Ron Paul is hypocritical when they dont support the Civil Rights Act.

AfricanBritish is something thats unheard of and I feel that the common practice of labelling certain races as a part of a group of minorities in the US rather than labelling them by their nationality is in fact encouraging social inequality in a subtle way. When you refer to a large of people entirely based on their race and they themselves do as well it may not seem wrong. Particularly when they are given equal opportunities and equal rights as the rest of the population. However I argue that since their identity has been linked to their race nonetheless it in fact encourages an image of separation.',\n 'Im not against feminism for the views and aims im against feminism simply because its the advocacy of womens rights and not the advocacy of mens and womens rights.

I believe that men and women should have equal rights but im not a feminist Id like the rights for both of the sexes were advocated and not simply womens.The only argument I hear when I mention my views on this is that feminism has evolved into what I would like in a equal rights movement. But by definition its the advocacy of womens rights I dont want to call myself a feminist when the name doesnt reflect my opinions.',\n 'So currently a lot of government benefits in the US are given as in kind transfers where the government gives you a voucher to buy a specific sort of thing. In particular food stamps give people a debit card with which they can buy nonprepared food from grocery stores and other food retailers.I think the restriction on what can be bought with these benefits should be repealed and that the recipients should decide for themselves what they want to buy.The restriction on buying only food is paternalistic and reduces the range of options available to poor families. Changing the benefit to a cash transfer will improve the welfare of poor families while saving the government money on their administration of the program. The rules requiring purchasing only food seem designed around ideas that poor people are irresponsible and prone to bad decision making and that the government knows better than them what they need. While some people would make worse decisions with the money it does not seem fair to greatly reduce the value of these benefits for the large majority of recipients who are conscientious people in extremely difficult circumstances.But these programs became the way they are for a reason so maybe Im missing something.',\n 'No I dont think that all people diagnosed with depression should just deal with it.

While I agree that it helps build your general way of looking at literature I think the system that it is taught as is inherently flawed If there is no wrong or right answer I feel treated rather unfairly being graded on a more or less binary system.

Of course with specific personal relationships it varies depending on how much youre supposed to look after the other person and other factors but as a general baseline i think that if the other person is into it you do not need to worry about their other commitments or relationships because they are making the conscious decision to hook up with you. This came to mind because as a straight dude if I hypothetically want to hook up with a hypothetical girl and she has a hypothetical boyfriend the hypothethical boyfriend might try and fight me although I believe I hypothetically did nothing wrong and all the blame goes on the hypothetical girl for not respecting her hypothetical existing relationships.',\n 'I hear lots of complaints about Windows everywhere from reddit to old people in Best Buy.

The former is something I rarely hear supported but is at least unambiguous in its meaning everyone has the same life quality in terms of health wealth education etc. Only people with a view of the world heavily slanted towards nurture believe this is possible and most accept it is beyond the remit of government to achieve it so far as I can tell.But equality of opportunity despite appearing to be meaningful at first glance is actually nonsense or at least as ambiguous as equality. Does this mean starting everyone from a same footing which would involve compensating for background and genetic discrepancies or simply applying the same provision to everyone? I dont view it as within the power of the state to arrange human affairs so that every child can have an equal chance of prospering at school and even if it was possible I think the destruction of freedom and family life it would entail would be deeply wounding.',\n 'I chose these criteria since other elements of greatness like history excitement level fun culture of the fan base universality are much harder to quantify.While I dont think American football is superior to all other sports in all of these criteria individually the sum of the skill athleticism and strategy required in American football makes it great.For example it probably takes more skill to hit a mph fastball or complete a gymnastics routine than to play football. It probably takes more athleticism to run a competitive marathon time or endure an MMA fight. I will say that I cant immediately think of a more strategic sport than football more on that in a bit. Though football isnt the greatest in all three categories it requires a great deal of each.Skill is probably the weakest of the three criteria for football but football is unique in the number and variety of skills required to make a football team function each position has to do things the others dont.

I posit that this doesnt make a difference. As the world moves to more and more mobile formats responsive sites apps more featureful phones saying that videos have to maintain the old ways is borderline curmudgeonly. Its akin to saying that you cant send tweets or use snapchat because I still use email and I cant read your messages with Gmail.A phone is more naturally held in portrait mode and so taking a video that way is going to be more common.

Contemporary Religions Cause Human Rights AbusesAll contemporary religions instruct their followers to conduct abuses of human rights as part of their religion. Contemporary Christianity when followed based on exact instructions rather than its spirit that is general guidelines and recurring themes which are presented throughout the Holy Bible instructs its practitioners to kill maim and torture anyone who happens to violate its codes. While truly literal Christians are a rarity even in the most fundamentalist circles largely due to syncretic difficulties with the currently existing laws and not because of a lack of motive to be even more extremist it is extremely common among more fundamentalist Christians to engage in such things as sexualorientation based discrimination child abuse and worse.

AlSham is itself an Arabic term which can be translated as either greater Syria or the Levant the latter of which is why ISIL is also an accurate translation.The problem is that in the English language media radio TV newspapers internet journalism ISIS is translated as The Islamic State of Iraq and Syria which is not a particularly good translation and it minimizes the international threat posed by the group.The Levant actually covers a huge swath of the western Middle East including Cyprus Israel Jordan Lebanon Palestine Syria and parts of Egypt and Turkey.When media use the term ISIS they are effectively saying that the threat of this group is limited to the two countries Iraq and Syria. On the other hand the term ISIL is slightly more accurate and also serves as a warning that this terrorist group poses a far more broadbased threat to the whole region.Therefore it is more accurate and useful to refer to the group as ISIL rather than ISIS. ..I want to thank everyone who participated and I will continue to respond to comments as they appear though not necessarily as quickly.',\n 'I believe that there is no such thing as a timeless movie book or play and so on.

There are many companies that do this by making customers happy and giving themselves a good public image but any good that is done by a company is an amoral action.

Without any evidence nobody would take my accusation seriously.But because so often theres no evidence in a rape case its become acceptable for evidenceless accusations to be taken seriously. Simply being accused of rape can get people fired from their jobs and destroy their life.Heres a great example of this where a student is carrying around a mattress until their accused rapist is expelled At that point what their doing has nothing to do with the legal system theyre just shaming the entire system until someone gives into their demands.

The formalities that surround it arose out of a necessity to know who is supposed to be responsible for which kids which people are supposed to inherit the property of diseased people and so on.For several thousand years it has been the duty of clergy and religious institutions to formalize monogamous relationships into marriage which is still the case in several countries. Only recently with the advent of suprareligious states brought about by the French Revolution has it been made into a secular issue.It wasnt something that people only started doing after someone voted for a law to bureaucratize it but the other way round it was something that was good and only then did states decide to appropriate it for their own sake.The state doesnt regulate marriage because its good for people.

You have dug that hole and fallen below societys status quo on drug use. If you then manage to maintain sobriety you will then be considered in line with status quo again arguably lower even then since you became addicted in the first place.Some people stay sober their entire lives and are never given accolades or congratulations.

To me activehelpful bystander henceforth known as active bystander mentality is an irresponsible teaching because it is dangerous relieves the school of a lot of responsibility and weakens the success rate of stopping bullying.Being an active bystander is dangerous because it redirects the flow of aggression from the previous victim to the person who decided to intervene. The aggression could be anything from just hateful words being thrown to something as severe as a lifeendingcrippling weapon being pointed at the new defender not necessarily a gun maybe a knife or something else. It forces the defender to cover both himherself as well as the initial victim. On top of this if there are other bystanders who choose to be harmful harmful bystanders now the defender has to defend against or more people.',\n 'With regards to sandwiches triangular cuts are far superior to rectangular cuts and should be the only ones ever used.

But that itself isnt accurate the sound is more of a fizz than pops.. Coke is a brand of soda.',\n 'Whenever I hear a song that ends in a fade out my opinion of the song as a whole drops. It seems to require much less thought and effort than actually coming up with a way to bring the song to a close and its highly unsatisfying to me.The fade out is usually during several repetitions of the chorus which in and of itself seems like lazy songwriting. If the song has said all it has to say repeating the chorus over and over again isnt going to improve or enhance it at all. Its just filler and I suspect thats often how its used to flesh out a song enough to make it long enough to play on the radio. Alternately I suppose that the purpose could be to keep that catchy hook in peoples heads and keep them wanting more which is good marketing but does not necessarily make it a better song.For another thing that wouldnt fly in any other art form.',\n 'A common argument for a flat tax rate is that a progressive tax rate removes the incentive for people to work hard to become rich. A person pulling in million a year taxed at the absurd rate of would be living a significantly more luxurious life than someone making a year taxed at . I cant imagine someone waking up one day and thinking It would be pointless to even try to do something more with my life because Ill just get taxed at a higher rate.

In the third store I finally found one and it was the last one they had in stock and it was in the clearance part of the store most likely meaning that this is their last one in stock and they dont plan on restocking it.This got me thinking I think its dumb how popular wireless mice have gotten when considering how much better wired mice are. Here are some reasons why I think they are better. Wired Mice are way cheaper.',\n 'Its occurred to me several times in the past few years that I take far fewer pictures than my peers.

I dont think its entirely fair to argue that because to those who are prolife opposing abortion has nothing to do with women. It has to do with the fetus. To these people a fetus is a person and has the right to life like anyone else.

That seems to be an absurd and hypocritical standard that the right wing media seems to enjoy holding when its convenient. That said I think its politically and morally tone deaf for a President to have a press conference about the very public and gruesome beheading of an American Journalist and then go directly to the golf course.I also think because of Reddits left leaning bias if this had happened with a Republican in the White House this kind of story would be on the front page or at least on the front of rpolitics.

Police in England are warning that it may be illegal to download or distribute this video.I dont think its too hard to understand my view. ISIS created a video which required irreversible harm to someone in order to create. They arent interested in making a monetary profit theyre interested in spreading their message to people.

The cop is now on trial but the young man is still dead.',\n 'So you dont have to wiki itThe second amendment is often discussed in terms of gun ownership but it seems very clear to me that the purpose of the amendment is to grant citizens the right to band together and protect themselves and their communities using deadly force if necessary.Dont get me wrong Im very glad it hasnt escalated to such a disastrous degree. Regardless I cant help but feel that the Founding Fathers would look at whats going on and say We give you the right to organize a militia and youre going to sit there and LET them point guns at you?',\n 'First of all I am not very informed on the whole Ferguson situation and Im not taking a stance. But in light of events like officers pointing guns at peaceful protestors or at media I have been overcome with rage everytime I see cops get away with behaviour like this. Even worse when I came to the realization that these sort of thing probably happens every day and it isnt until todays era that we can finally have proof thanks to cameras being everywhere. Now I understand the power of doxing and how it puts not only the subject in danger but their family aswell I believe it is the best kind of ultimatum to get these cops to admit their wrongs and be judged fairly by the law.

I dont think these two articles prove the death of religion I think they exemplify a growing divide that is not going to be fixed. I believe this divide is heading toward a turning point in the macrohistory of humanity. People have been moving toward a secularized society for centuries and in the past few decades it has reached a level where the most conservative and religious elements can no longer find enough common ground to coexist.

People are fully capable of voting on things like their favorite ice cream or their favorite tv show.This system breaks down when the voters do not have the necessary skills or knowledge to make a proper judgement.',\n 'There is a lot that we know about the world because of science but we cannot say for sure that we know everything about our own existence. How do we know that beyond what we know there is not a creator? I think that pushing your Atheist beliefs is just as narrowminded as any religious belief. Many Atheists argue that Religion is the cause of many of the worlds problems much like Religious groups have often argued that people who do not follow their own beliefs are the cause of their problems. It is a fairly hypocritical viewpoint.',\n 'Im reading Pilgrim at Tinker Creek by Annie Dillard for school and Im all for appreciating the beauty of nature and everything but I cant help but think its bullshit to look for meaning in it like she does. I want to be able to at least appreciate Dillards writing even if I dont completely agree with her views but thats difficult when she seems like an idiot with a good vocabulary. Obviously that isnt true because otherwise her book wouldnt be so popular but I dont see why.I dont see anything to suggest that there is any sort of special meaning in nature and I think we should enjoy the beauty in the world without trying to find some kind of message from a higher being that probably doesnt exist. Science shows that its all a result of chance and time matter interacting with other matter eventually forming stars and planets and life. It all happened on its own and I feel like thats much more impressive than someone coming along and creating the universe and infusing everything with meaning.Trying to find meaning in things that dont really have any seems like a really common thing and it kind of looks like people trying to change the reality of the universe to try to fit it into understandable terms.',\n 'TLDR In order for the American people to have a significant role with the current government and structure we would all have to become significantly more informed than we currently are.The American political system can be criticized on many levels. For example many feel that the Americas FPTP system is to blame as it reduces electoral competition as per Duvergers law. Others feel that a more powerful criticism is that singlemember districts allow legislators to engage in partisan gerrymandering diluting the voter strength of the opposition party. Some blame draconinan Voter ID laws meant to disenfranchise certain demographic groups. Some blame Americas campaign finance system asserting that unrestricted donations from individuals and corporations corrupts the system and makes legislators beholden to their donors and backers rather than to their constituents.',\n 'I believe that the suburbs are a worse environment to raise children in than either more rural areas or more urbanized areas generally speaking. Im aware there was a on this subject not too long ago However theres a few points I feel werent made there. Ill try to avoid treading over the same ground.For one my idea of an urban area is one where most amenities are in range of walking biking or a relatively short bus ride. This includes schools shops parks etc. This was brought up in the past AMA but the discussion didnt really include a comparison of accessibility.',\n 'I am extremely angered when I hear things like Michael Brown was executed.

Also I am referring to accepting money for scholarships not scholarships that were established in the past and are simply continuing to run on investments.Prior to the past or so years there was a massive gender gap in university. This gap was due to stigma against women and the status quo that existed at that time. Scholarships were very important to encourage females to attend university. Likewise racial minorities were greatly misrepresented.',\n 'First off let me clarify I am not defending the actions of Ferguson Police Officer Darren Wilson. I believe that he did use excessive force and the shooting should be thoroughly investigated. This post is not to debate over whether or not Officer Wilson needs to be tried or whether the Ferguson Police is an example of police militarisation in the US. This post is solely to look at the decision to release the CCTV footage of Michael Brown robbing a convenience store.Now that thats out of the way I dont really understand why everyone was so angry at the release of the CCTV footage showing what appears to be Michael Brown robbing a convenience store. I see in multiple news sources where people have stated that the footage appeared to cast aspersions on the dead man or is a form of character assassination. Finding out that the shooting victim had just returned from robbing a store is critical information because it provides context for the fact that a police officer confronted him over something minor and unrelated like obstructing the street and a violent altercation took place soon after.',\n 'For every song with a positive message like Keep ya head up or Changes hes got more that glorify gang violence and shootings. The idea that he was nonviolent is totally at odds with the music he actually made.A brief glance at his wikipedia page will also show you that he was an exceptionally violent person He assaulted another rapper with a baseball bat in and assaulted a film director in . In both cases he plead guilty. He was also found guilty of gang raping a woman in a hotel a crime for which he was sent to prison.With anybody else those three crimes would be enough to judge someone as an extremely violent and unsafe person highly unsuited to be a role model for anybody but for some reason hes earned a reputation for being some kinda hiphop gandhi. There are plenty of legendary rappers like Mos Def Nas and Andre whose positive messages are overlooked in favour of Tupac despite managing to avoid assaulting or raping people.The fact that Tupac garners as much respect as he does is symptomatic of massive immaturity in certain parts of the hiphop community.',\n 'Okay lets clear some stuff up first. I dont hate children at all I love kids like my nephew hes an amazing little guy and Id like to think Im a pretty good uncle. But having kids means distractions less money and generally less life.

I am specifically arguing this from a perspective of US law.There are various things that disqualify people from being allowed to purchase or possess firearms or ammunition. These generally include sometimes depending on state being involuntarily committed to a mental institution being the target of a restraining order being adjudicated by a court to be mentally unfit to stand trial being convicted of a violent misdemeanor or a domestic violence crime and being convicted of a felony.Most people seem to be perfectly happy with prohibiting some people from possessing firearms based on their history convictions mental illness etc. I believe we should be very careful with who we remove constitutionally protected rights from but I am ok with removing firearm rights through due process of law in most of the cases where we do under current law.My question is why do we not remove the privilege of people to possess and consume alcohol under certain circumstances? This isnt a constitutionally protected right and removal of that freedom would be done with due process anyway so there is no particular reason why we cannot do it.We should create a list of offenses that disqualify a person from being allowed to possess or consume alcohol.',\n 'Im not a fan of the way policy discussion takes place and feel it could be more productive.Let us start off with abortion.

For example I saw a post on two x that didnt really refute any restrictive abortion policies but just stated the right to bodily autonomy as an argument against them.

Im not advocating for the abolition of the age of consent. I accept that the power differential and the immaturity of the younger person makes it problematic at the very least.Yet all the same I think its a great false equivalency to consider it to be a similar magnitude offense to being held down and raped. The primary reason I believe this and admittedly its based on little more than intuition is that I feel that victims of the respective crimes tend to feel much differently in hindsight.',\n 'Ive argued this to friends before and stand by it. If I have the decision and free will to do A B C or X Y Z in my life or in my day then God can not be omniscient and know what is going to happen because ultimately the decision is up to me.

This would mean that anyone saying Im not going to explain these people have done it far better than I ever could arent necessarily wrong in saying that but not to attempt it is anti debate. This is also true because the reading of these materials creates a time delay in which the materials must be found time and then have that time put into reading them which the suggester of the materials is essentially using as a shield.

While meateaters dont actively kill the animals themselves by eating them they support the slaughterhouses and farms that do kill the animals for food production by continuing to consume meat.',\n 'Many people including myself believe that living in the countryside is better for those who wish to preserve several social and environmental values.

Here are a few of the things that I think it would improve.Increased voter turnout as some people may not have someone to vote for but may have someone they absolutely do not want to win.It would make third party candidates chances at winning more viable.People would feel like they can be more engaged without selling themselves short by feeling the need to support someone who is of the same political party but a subpar candidate.It would allow for a whole new analysis of the political spectrum we have once we start seeing polls reflecting this new voting method.I honestly cant think of one negative implication of this idea becoming a reality.',\n 'Obviously somewhat inspired by the sad death of Robin Williams.As the title says I think that the majority of people who declare their sadness for the death of a celebrity are attention seeking simply wanting to jump on the band wagon or irrationally upset.Whilst I accept that people may have been inspired by works that the celebrity has done or feel they can relate to some of their work I do not accept that the emotional outpouring is genuine such as with the current Robin Williams situation and Michael Jackson.People who are genuinely distraught about celebrities theyve never met are likely to be either overly attached or overly involved with that celebrity.I obviously see nothing wrong with expressing sadness that they have passed or concerns for their family but as a generalisation the outpouring of emotion is ridiculous and fake.Change my view!',\n 'When discussing people in altered states including those brought about through organic pathology or mental illnesses like schizophrenia and psychotic depression it is inappropriate and false to state such individuals are less in contact with reality.The reason is that nobody experiences reality directly.

Because your perceptual faculties are shaped by evolutionary pressures.

Im currently in college and I know many high school athletes that use PEDs and it is even more prevalent in college so if you believe this is a problem it is certainly not being solved by policing only the upper echelons of sports.I say these things not because I want Steroids legalized I would never do them I am an entirely natural athlete using only vitamins and whey protein.Some BroScience for Levity',\n 'A TV series is inherently better when watched in the original language.

Instead of discussing the reasons for atheism or what follows from it for example many of those on the subreddits focus on either laughing at theists or arguing against religious beliefs and for humanist ones. If the subreddits are to be used in these ways they shouldnt be named as if theyre about anything other than antitheism. Atheism is a lack of belief in a deity and nothing more. It can be discussed but there is much more to that discussion than petty arguing against Abrahamic religion.',\n 'So I think this is probably a pretty unpopular topic since most of the posts I see on the gaming subreddits are about how great older games are.

I have many fond memories of playing that console at my friends houses back in the mid s but never having one myself because my mom forbade it. I decided to get one now that I am a self sufficient adult and play a few of the games I remember being awesome.

I realize that this law and others like it are possibly in violation of several human rights declarations which these countries have ostensibly ratified.

We focused so much on it I thought that the Declaration of Independence was the most important document America ever had. While it definitely isnt unimportant the DoI was more a list of reasons why the King of England sucked and why they wanted independence as their own nation. The Constitution however is the backbone to how America is run far more relevant to modern American life than the Declaration.Granted st and nd graders might not fully understand what the Constitution is and its easier to teach the Declaration to them but I think that th and th graders would definitely be able to understand the basics of the Constitution Bill of Rights and amendments perhaps even rd graders.The Declaration is great for when you want to teach kids about the Revolutionary War.

The global temperature is increasing wildly and in a few years many heavily populated areas will exceed wet bulb temperature meaning they will become so hot that it would be impossible for human life to exist there. These areas would include much of the eastern and southeastern United States. This would lead to the collapse of much of civilization and untold numbers of deaths would surely follow. I admittedly dont know much about climate science and Im hoping if I did I would be able to dismiss this but from what Ive read it seems fairly solid.Even the US Navy has predicted an icefree arctic by which seems to support the idea that global warming is increasing at an exponential rate.I would really really like my view on this changed.',\n 'Ive had several friends come out as nonbinary or genderfluid and such and such and I just cant buy into it.

At this stage we would be capable of creating consciousness similar to our own. I believe that our current inability to explain the nature of our selfawareness is rooted in ignorance of our biology.

I ended up with a GPA so low that it was an embarrassment to my Asian family who are sticklers about marks.

With that being said I feel that the two game suspension administered by the NFL to Ray Rice is justifiable if not too heavy a punishment. If a court of law decides that the case shouldnt go to trial why should Roger Goodell suspend him for any extended amount of time? I agree that he should face some form of discipline and two games seems a fair punishment if not excessive. However the media has chastised Goodell and the league for condoning domestic violence and not taking a stand.',\n 'A debt snowball is when you pay your debts off in order of smallest to largest ignoring interest rates.Advantages It is psychologically beneficial.

In most of these your character slaughters hundreds or thousands of nameless often identical male thugsguardssoldiers. These characters play no role in the story other than as inconvenient or dangerous obstacles to be shot or stabbed or set on fire.Compared to that individual female characters with names being sexually objectifiedcaptured by the bad guy killed as a plot device isnt too bad.Just to be clear I dont really think either of these is a very significant issue in the scheme of things.',\n 'Fact It is widely accepted that the Universe must have a beginning.Claim Intelligent Design and the Big Bang theory explain this phenomenon with the same basic foundation.ID says There is some intelligent being who exists outside of our understanding of time.

First of all the physicality of men and women are different and on the sports field this would perhaps affect the game. On average men are stronger than women so I dont think that its fair to have people with different abilities to play together.

Why dont bicyclists have these same restrictions and obligations to use those same roads?Many places dont allow bicycles on sidewalks so if that is the case and there is no bicycle lane designated on that particular road then there should be no bicycling allowed in that particular area.

I often come across liberal minded thinkers who say that everyone is entitled to their opinion and should be accepted no matter who they are yet they refuse to accept people they deem as intolerant for who they are. This seems to include massive groups such as organized religion people opposed to same sex marriage conservatives non western cultures that have non liberal views such as arabic culture having a different idea of gender roles if its a culture that is more similiar to our own then it falls under the protected liberal category and various others. I have also seen this view extended to a desire to remove some of their basic freedoms most notably freedom of speech and the freedom to congregate.To clarify I am not asking to debate individual views of the liberal community womens rights gay rights....

If someone has killed another person by say raping and then burying their victim alive what makes an hour or two of suffering on their way out so unacceptable?Since Reddit is largely liberal Id expect a healthy response but let me clarify my position before rebuttals are made. My issue is with the ethics of inflicting pain before execution.

If someone walks into your office or can see over your shoulder from across the room an image on your screen of someones intestines hanging out or some topless lady is something theyre going to recognize and possibly get you in trouble for.A text post on the other hand just looks like reddit.

My main example would be whats referred to as the Brownie Skip in Super Meat Boy.',\n 'I often hear people discussing gun control legislation as common sense seemingly as a way of getting out of having to actually explain the logic behind them. To me the most significant manifestation of this issue is the tremendous amount of support for legislation that would disallow anyone diagnosed with a mental illness to own a firearm. At first thought such a measure seems to make sense. Surely this legislation would make it such that dangerous mentally ill people cannot obtain firearms making the world a safer place.But consider this.

However hes in way too many scenes to the point that he just gets annoying.CPO does nothing to drive the story forward. I feel that you could actually remove him from all of the films and the plots wouldnt really change that much. The only thing hes good at is language interpretations but he doesnt fill that role often enough to justify him getting so much screen time.If CPO was in fewer scenes he would be a decent character but the fact that hes in so many and the fact that hes actually kind of useless really damages our enjoyment of the character.

Generosity is defined as showing a readiness to give more of something as money or time than is strictly necessary or expected. From what I know Id say that in richer circles donating to something andor someone is in fact expected and that you may be perceived badly if you dont donate. Giving above a certain amount can serve as cheap advertising for those donating and serves to increase their reputation with the public. The tax benefits available for those who donate at large amounts can offset the cost of donating and I believe even provide an incentive to give in the first place.',\n 'When you have a slow network you dont improve it by upgrading the fastest nodes.

This currently exists to a much lesser extent with welfare but thats unfortunately necessary because some people are trying to find a job or just cant support a family which if they knew that they wouldnt make enough money to support one anyways then they shouldnt have had kids.Instead of just giving people tax money why dont we put money towards infrastructure that helps people make money through working? i.e. schools for education factories for uneducated workers etc.Also when the U.S is in trillion in debt I dont think the proper investment with our money is to just hand it to people. The people you give the money to will still not be skillededucated enough to get a better job to help our economy. It would only make us go into more debt.So .',\n 'You can charge million per copy and I consider that your right but as soon as you take something off the market permanently I believe you have no right to complain about copyright infringement.Consider a band that creates an album releasing it freely on the internet. They build up a huge fanbase releasing free albums. Then the lead singer has an existential crisis dissolves the band and takes down the website making it impossible for new fans to find their albums.I believe that the bands fans are completely justified in making and distributing copies of the bands albums since the original creator has refused to make them available and has shown no indication that they will ever be available again and in fact has indicated the exact opposite.I believe that in contrast a company like Disney who has a track record of pulling and rereleasing their movies every few years for marketing purposes shouldnt lose their protection.

I would consider myself more independent compared to other teenage girls however I believe that research is required before making decisions such as birth control.I believe that teenage girls are first of all not mature enough to have a well researched or experience say in their sex lives. Their parents have gone through decisions like these and if teenage girls do not have the ability to trust their parents then they do not have the ability to trust their own decisions. Especially since birth control involves potential health risks that teenage girls may not be aware of increasingly validates the point that teenage girls should talk to their parents before deciding whether or not they should take birth control pills.Another point is that I believe if teens were given the ability to take birth control without the consent of their parents they would be increasingly prone to chances of obtaining sexually transmitted diseases. To prevent this teenagers should talk to their parents about possible health risks involved with taking birth control pills.However being a teenage girl myself I feel that my opinions are not well researched and do not consider the statuses of other teenage girls within their families.',\n 'What someone else masturbates to and how much they do it as long as it doesnt involve disturbing others i.e. masturbating in a public place is their business.

For example masturbating to someones picture on Facebook as long as the person doing it does not disturb the other person by telling them about it is perfectly acceptable.

This makes sense in that the Genie requires that his freedom be wished for in order for him to be free.The problem with this is that the Genie was able to get himself Aladdin and company outside of the Cave of Wonders without it counting as one of Aladdins wishes. In this case it seems the Genie has unlimited power but is constrained to fulfill whatever wishes his master desires which brings us to...Scenario Genie can do what he wants but must follow his masters wishes.lets also assume that the Genie cannot free himselfIn this case the Genie lives his life as he chooses but just wants freedom so he doesnt have to fulfill a random guys wishes.The problem with this then is when Aladdin was handcuffed and drowning why did Genie require Aladdin to wish for himself to be saved? Why wouldnt the Genie just save him using his own relatively free will?In either of these situations why didnt the Genie just strike up a deal with Aladdin that if Aladdin wished for the Genies freedom instantly once the Genie was free the Genie could just provide Aladdin with wishes as if he were the Genies master?This is something that is such a critical part in the plot of the movie that really needs clarifying for me to enjoy the film fully.',\n 'This is something I used to go back and forth on with an ex.

This could be done easily with either a hybrid of a forkknifespoon or simply bringing several tools for the job. A nondisposable pair of chopsticks would be even easier to bring with you too.This would also be a boon for hygiene as every person would be responsible for keeping their set of cutlery clean preferably with some type of paper napkin to rub over with after a meal.A common counterargument I get is about where one would carry the cutlery especially for men who tend to not bring handbags with them.

These distractions are either the driver adjusting the music or just the distraction of the sound.Many professional drivers such as airline pilots or train engineers are legally prohibited to listen to music. If professionals are prohibited to listening to music because of distraction then that is even more reason to prohibit amateurs to listening to music.Since enforment of this would be difficult for law enforcement the prohibition needs to be technical. This would mean that all new cars need to turn off music when the car is in motion.',\n 'This was initially my comment in this thread concerning this article.

Having this knowledge at hand gives women power to properly negotiate their salary thus receiving equal pay to men with the same level of knowledgecredentialsexperience.For example and Im just making these figures up lets say Im applying to be a chemical engineer at a manufacturing facility in Cincinnati. Based on the extensive research Ive done I know that chemical engineers with my credentials should make between KK a year.I make it through rounds of interviews and the company offers me the job and says theyll pay me K a year. Based on my research I know that number is unfair so I negotiate until I reach somewhere between KK. If the company doesnt agree to pay me what I believe to be the industry standard and what a man would make in that position I walk. Or I accept the lower pay knowing that it is my fault Im making less than what Im worth.Women who complain that they arent making equal pay to men either didnt do their proper research when applying for the job didnt negotiate their salaries effectively or are too lazy to leave and find another job which pays them what theyre worth.For what its worth I am a woman. !',\n 'Im not really big into sports but I think that having leagues distributed by height could be great for basketball. I always enjoyed college games over professional games due to a greater focus on teamwork and strategy as opposed to personalities doing massive feats. While some even the majority of people will always prefer the NBAs entertainment value there is little to be lost by offering the vertically challenged a chance to strut their stuff.Much like boxing while many want to see the heavy hitters engaged in a mighty battle some appreciate the agility and and timing of the lower weight classes. These lower classes are every bit if not more talented but hardly stand a chance when pitted against the heaviest men in the sport. I think basketball also loses many talented players due to the lack of heightclasses.Only reason I couldnt see this happening is funding but for community and school sports it should be a nobrainer.',\n 'In order for a child to be sucessful heshe needs to be raised in a stable household economically socially and emotionally. It is the responsibility of the parents to maintain this stability. A divorce screws up the devolopment of the child because heshe is being removed from the previous household climate and is likely to become depressed and emotionally unstable. The only excusable times for a divorce while raising kids would be if there is clear domestic violence or abuse in which case the child is not safe. Otherwise divorce neglects the childs emotional needs the same way exposing the child to second hand smoke neglicts hisher health needs.',\n 'At the end of the day the decision made by the supreme courts has very limited application. It only applies to companies that are owned at least by or fewer people. This basically means that if you and your family own a company that gets large enough that you can sell some of it to raise capital you can still run it according to your values. This doesnt mean a company the size of apple could do the same thing.It is also almost completely being neglected that it only applies to types of birth control.

I would also like to add that I think not posting this publicly and still rejecting menwoman on the basis of being insert racialethnic group here is also racist. Why do I think this is racist?An individual in this scenario is outright say heshe does not wish to speak to someone on the basis of race and were to assume heshe will ignore comments from individuals belonging to whatever group heshe is excluding.

They were invented in the US.. Marketing.In fact its much more than in my opinion. Its almost terrifying to me that PURE marketing has made a product as terrible as American football so central to American culture. Both the NFL and MLB are unnecessarily complex in the way they play the game and have very little actual game per game.This has nothing to do with what other nations play or dont play I just find the NFL and MLB to be almost entirely unredeeming events that people only like because they and there family have been marketed the product since birth.The things that people tell me are great qualities about football strategy execution etc. are things that it has less of than several other sports.',\n 'I often see criticisms of the use of burqas and other pieces of clothing meant to cover up Muslim women.

I am neither for nor against the motion of Christian propaganda.With that being said I have meditated and experienced first hand the effects a large gathering of Christians can have on the mindset of a person without a belief system.After visiting a couple church sermons I am amazed at how fast a church is capable of taking someone with a completely opposite mindset and conforming them instantly within a couple sermons. I am even more astounded by how fast churches are capable of taking children and within a week theyve got the child radically supporting an adopted belief system.I thought to myself Either Christianity is so true that a good preacher can convert masses out of how obvious the belief system is or there is some sort of fallacy going on here.Heres what might be happeningTake this first set of statements.

It gets infected and you take a course of amoxicillin and youre fine.AIDS Herpes Chlamydia Syphilis and so forth are much more serious than this. They are dangerous infectious diseases that need to be treated as such.It is my view that the term STI emerged from the STD community as a way for them to not feel like they are carrying a terrible disease but its misleading. The change in the descriptor helps peoples feelings but conveys less information.Saying that someone who has AIDS isnt diseased but merely has an infection significantly reduces the severity of the condition.',\n 'Why I want this view changed?

Proabortion is short for in favor of the right to abort.For the record I am a socialist proabortion atheist. Although I disagree with the antiabortion view I dont think it has anything to do with religion or excessive government control.The chief antiabortion argument is that fetuses are alive. Whether life begins at conception weeks or whatever is not the point wherever you draw the line the motivation behind prohibiting abortion is to save lives.Some peoples beliefs about when life begins are determined by their religion.

See Female character model controversies Mirrors Edge Assassins Creed etc. Jobs dominated by men engineering blue collar jobs etc. are being encouraged more and more for females to join. At the same time society is essentially calling these jobscompanies sexist because of the low percentages of women which has resulted in lots of companies pushing hard for more women in the work place.',\n 'First I will be referring to American Football as football and the sport commonly referred to as football in many regions as soccer.

In the beginning Genesis there was a garden with a tree usually symbolizing knowledge or life. Adam and Eve were told not to eat from the tree i.e. obey God. They nontheless did it anyways. This is where we either became flawed or died from a perfect human depending on the theology.But many years later God sent His only Son Jesus to spread His word and ultimately to be sacrificed to pay for the sins that came after Adam and Even and including that ultimate sin.If Jesus is accepted to be part of the trinity then it has been said that God sent himself to earth to sacrifice himself to himself so that he can forgive us for the act that Adam and Eve did did he forsee this action?.For this I am narrowing it to two specific views.',\n 'Valeri Polyakov the human to live longest in space was there for months.

These kinds of people likely dont even understand the concept of graduation I had one person try to eat his diploma. We have to use all these tricks to make them look at the camera like whistling snapping etc. and even then it hardly ever comes out as a good picture.My view is that the purpose of a diploma is to prove you are able to function in a civilized society. Those without diplomas or equivalent i.e. dropouts are shunned and excluded from society denied the same opportunities in society because they were unable to prove that they could function properly.',\n 'In many superhero TV shows and comics superheroes are extremely unwilling to kill villains instead preferring to capture them. Ordinarily this would be fine and I think it is for the most part effective against ordinary criminals who are easily contained. When we consider supervillains we consistently see that they either break free of capture or avoid getting captured in the first place. These villains often go on to pursue other schemes that result in significant harm or death to innocent civilians. If thats the case then it would be better for heroes to apply lethal force in order to prevent villains from escaping and endangering more lives.',\n 'I have never really been interested in the whole manmade global warming issue. I have strong positions on certain philosophical questions for example I am confident that God does not exist and that morality is as objective as physics. However empirical questions like global warming are less interesting to me because they depend so much on analysis of details. By empirical questions I mean questions that depend more strongly on experimental evidence than on reflection on everyday experience or our knowledge of history.There is an exception to my impatience with empirical issues which is the debate over the theory of evolution. I like studying the evidence for the theory of evolution although I am very far from a biologist because it is a paradigmatic example of settled science that almost all relevant scientists accept.',\n 'Health insurance already covers far more than it should. Theres no good reason why people cant directly pay for routine checkups simple medical treatment e.g. getting stitches or even for drugs that we can anticipate needing as we age. All these things would be much cheaper if their prices werent artificially inflated by the unnecessary involvement of insurance companies.Health insurance should be like all other kinds of insurance It should only cover costs that are prohibitively expensive urgently needed and difficult to predict needing in advance. You dont use homeowners insurance to fix a broken window or use car insurance to get an oil change. So thats my broad reason for being against health insurance covering birth control and incidentally Viagra too.But I would go even further to argue that birth control especially doesnt belong in health insurance policies even compared to Viagra.',\n 'After moving homes about times as an adult Ive started to think that we have the idea of owning furniture and large appliances backwards. We go to great expense and effort to move heavy tables beds refrigerators washerdriers etc. whenever we relocate and at the same time embrace the concept that light fixtures sinks bathtubs toilets kitchen counters and soon should come with the house and be left with the house.I think we should extend this attitude to furniture and appliances. Beds couches armchairs dining room tables and chairs refrigerators washing machines and other large furniture and appliances should be considered part of the house condo or apartment and included in the price when you buy or sell it. They dont belong on a moving van.We should view upgrades to our couches the same way we see remodeling a kitchen. When we move we dont usually rip out the countertops sinks and cabinets just because we paid for them.',\n 'To start this off let me say that I one day want to work in manufacturing currently going into junior year of chemical engineering and thus I tend to view the monetary aspects of issues too much.Pros of electric vehiclesGreat for personal use lt miles dailyVery quite and often comfortable form of transportationLow cost to operate on a daily basis for the userCan be powered through renewable energy sourcesMass production fuels innovationPromotes the awareness of sustainable behaviorsCan be powered from a home easilyConsUpfront cost everyone loves Tesla but thats a ton of money.

This is one of my biggest concerns. If you can afford a Tesla you really shouldnt need a tax break!Artificial cost due to fleet standards lowering the cost of EVs and Hybrids while raising the cost of standard vehiclesPointless if the energy comes from coal the nation is doing a fantastic job at lowering coal dependance though currentlyHigh cost of replacing the battery every yearsCurrent low production of rare earth metals will restrict the mass production of electric vehicles until production picks upDependence on foreign nations for some rareearth metalsMany vehicles simply demand too much energy to be battery powered construction military freight etc. and these vehicles contribute quite a bit to current vehicle emissionsMany purchasers of EVs simply purchase the vehicles as a status symbol with no actual care for the environmentIn some areas EVs contribute to congestion CA allowing EVs to use carpool lanes and thus taking away incentive to carpool which protects the environment more than owning an EV anywaysSo my viewpoint to summarize is thus EVs are wonderful concepts and should continue to be worked on. They should not however be mass produced yet.',\n 'Queuing is a simple system the first person who needs a service is the first person who gets that service the second is the second and soon. I realise that there are other systems and values that can be considered when deciding who gets to use a service first and I am more than happy to use these systems when they are presented. For example separate queues for people who need different amounts of service time and the like items or less checkouts.but of the time a simple queue is the best way to determine who gets served first not a scrum of people crowding around the service elbowing their way forward with no regard for politeness or etiquette this is the kind of systems which promote different values for who gets served first values like being pushy or being physically attractive values which I believe pale in comparison to was there first.This is a big problem in two places bars and everywhere apart from England a joke I assure you though a pointed one. Bars get a small pass because I understand that standing behind someone is a really hard concept to grasp when you are drunk but less sarcastically there are space concerns and barsnightclubs seem to be a place where politeness goes to die.As for the second half I just dont understand why cant people understand that a disordered scrum just isnt fair or dignified and reduces us to piglets suckling at their mothers teat.Sorry for being a little overly British but I have just returned from a three month stint travelling around Europe and this point really struck me.',\n 'Without getting specific as to which ones are worse or denying the necessity of antivirus software in general for you know viruses.

There is real disillusionment in that moment when you first learn that Santas not real and theres a real feeling that youve been lied to because well you have been lied to all your life by the very people you should trust the most.

They are bad for your posture. They reduce the depth of the couch you can sit onIf you want to keep pillows there for sleeping on why leave them on the couch when you can put them away and save extra couch space?

For example studies evaluating the happiness of a child between the two parent sets the portrayal of samesex couples in media think Modern Family.I think that focusing on equating samesex and oppositesex couples effectively destroys a unique culture that cannot be compared to the cultures of cisgendered heterosexuals. By fighting for marriage equality people are truly fighting for the destruction of a culture.Such culture has its own unique jargons histories familial structures and belief systems. This culture exists within the bounds of other cultures and should be celebrated and certainly not shunned. However if Queer people are equated with the heterosexual and cisgendered populations this culture is lost.For example one can observe the history of Native Americans.',\n 'Im fifteen and I come from Maine a very rural town with lots of drug problems in the youth.

To the extent that I think its wrong to do so rather than just that its okay to do so. I believe that society benefits more if these wouldbe philanthropic companies were to avoid the cost of supporting orphanages etc. and passed the savings on to their customers. Ultimately it is consumers who are in the best position to decide how to use that saved money to benefit society whether that is through just keeping the savings for themselves charity starts at home or through direct donations to the orphanage.

I am an Asian male here in America and honestly I have it pretty good but for every Asian American like me Im sure theres some out there who are treated like shit on the daily merely on the basis of their race and the various stereotypes that come with them.I feel since movies from the s along with other forms of media certain stereotypes and forms of subtle racism against Asians has been staggeringly prevalent in not just the US but media as a whole.Also every time I see or hear race being brought up in a debate Asians tend to be neglected in these circumstances.Also my main gripe comes mainly from the slew of stereotypes of Asians I witness on the daily especially in my hometown in Virginia.People act as if its okay because Oh lol! Asians are good at math great with technology and bad drivers! Its always been that way and always will be!More importantly I find it kinda bullshit that as an individual of Asian descentsomething far out of my control and my future childrens as well that I am automatically put at a disadvantage. Im not just compared to other applicants in schools or jobs Im compared primarily to other people of my racial background. I kinda get the feeling Asians tend to be higher achievers because were systematically forced to compete and fight against one another for pursuing similar fields which seems incredibly bogus to me.Before attempting to heres two things I would like you to consider when responding Yes I do indeed find some stereotypical jokes about Asians funny but I dont appreciate the constantly regurgitated ones like were good at math and were bad drivers.

I believe people may have MORE introverted tendencies but to fully identify as an introvert only serves to be selflimiting in social situations.

I have seen people who call themselves introverts complaining about being talked to by extroverts and being forced to talk by being asked questions.

Obviously this is murder but if it is clear that Isildur would be corrupted by the ring and allowing the ring to survive leads to the return of Sauron and countless deaths than the only reasonably course of action is to push Isildur into the fire assuming Elrond could not have forcibly taken the ring. Furthermore if the quest of the fellowship had failed and the ring had not been destroyed at the end of the third age then Elronds passivity would have lead to Saurons dominance over Middle Earth.',\n 'Insanity. n. mental illness of such a severe nature that a person cannot distinguish fantasy from reality cannot conduct herhis affairs due to psychosis or is subject to uncontrollable impulsive behavior.This definition could also be used for almost any person who has faith in any religion.

Firstly he defines reclaiming a word as the oppressed group is able to remove the sting of a derogatory term specific to their group by using it among other members.Basically the only word that has kind of been reclaimed is the nword but that still packs a huge sting so he argues it hasnt been effectively reclaimed. He argues that while minorities should be able to use these words the rest of the population is not equipped to understand why they cant use these words and that When a white kid sees his favorite rapper use the word he assumes that despite the historical significance of its oppressive qualities its now fine to say the nword.

Also he could be thinking we could have just gived him the money..But my point was that just by giving him anything implies we have more money than him and by wearing fancy cloth of a total value much greater than the cheeseburgers was also saying that we have more resources than him.

If this distinction is valid then quantum physics is a soft science.Secondly even before physics we have postulates axioms and first principles which is properly the domain of philosophy and mathematics.I am arguing that Maths philosphy and the assorted sciences are continuous rather than discrete in any meaningful sense.

After the struggle of the whole book it is nice that the protagonist we have grown attached to has eventually found peace and is no longer scared.I understand why some people find it depressing as The Party arent overthrown and the totalitarians that oppress the people win.

In my opinion the churchs account of Christs teachings basically states that ones best chance of receiving salvation lies in his ability to live in total pacifism and that everyone should simply forget their differences love each other and share with each other.

Amperes are to me always behind In a simple household in America the voltage is always V. The amperage continually depends on what kind of device is plugged in according to Ohms law V RI the current seems more of a product of the voltage and resistance rather than the voltage being a product of current and resistance The base definition of an Ampere is lets face it pretty fucked up.

Certainly people can say that the same must be true for accessories like fashion scarves or for things like leather cuffs However even though both of these other examples have roots in utility and function when the functionality is removed something more ornate is added or possible. In the scarf example a utilitarian scarf is thick to provide warmth and insulation a fashion scarf removes the functional thickness but opens the door for patterned textiles or forms that are not possible on thicker scarves.

It is the responsibility of the parent to take care of the basic needs of their child and adequate foodnutrition is one of those basic needs. Sending the child to school does not absolve them of that responsibility and does not transfer that responsibility to the school.The most common argument I have heard is that children are required to go to school and therefore the school is acting as a parent for those eight hours and is responsible for providing for the students needs during that time.

The first is that the school is not responsible for providing any other consumable goods to the students pencil paper clothing etc. and it is unreasonable to arbitrarily assign the responsibility of nutrition to them.',\n 'I think illegal drugs should stay illegal and I havent heard a convincing argument otherwise.

Theres this weird quality that lies outside of the physical realm and cannot be justified by it because you cant easily leap from something existing to something being moral without something being taken as axiomatic and yet we are bound by it with threads made up of this also strange material? All moral systems seem to start from an assumption that X is good and we therefore must do X and I cant seem to find any reason to believe that I should make that jump. Why should I believe in some magical moral rule when the world seems so clearly explicable without it?',\n 'I was raised catholic but under the belief that sex is only morally acceptable between two people who are in love not necessarily marriage. I believe that its wrong to have sex with someone you dont love or have strong feelings for and I dont understand how some people can sleep with many partners and not feel ashamed or embarrassed.

Im not sure how the system works in other countries.Right now any male in the US must register with Selective Service within days of their th birthday. Obviously this doesnt always happen but current rates are estimated to be around percent. The purpose is so that if the US gets in a large war we can institute a draft and conscript an army. This obviously makes some sense.But Id like to take it a step further.Instead of registering with the SSS yearolds should be required to enlist in the Army Reserve for the eight year service period.The reasons for this are pretty simple as I see it Firstly we would never need a draft again because if a large war came we could simply activate some of the millionodd Reservists to fight.',\n 'The longest relationship Ive been in is about months and at the end it was just heart ache and pain of having someone break up with me.

Essentially my current train of thought is as follows. Voter turnout in the United States has turned into a huge issue that politicians and those more politically inclined have latched onto. I believe this probably stems from the civil rights era in which disenfranchised minority voters were denied through unfair voting regulations e.g. voting tests the right to a political vote.',\n 'I believe his for a few reasons Putin will not care.

Something is wrong with us.The rich business savvy Brits they are and the music they make is not only an inauthentic loose impression of folkAmericana music but by bridging the gap between that genre and corporate pop they have perverted the essence of what folk is supposed to be.There exists a tradition of confronting the zeitgeist of society in folk music an independent spirit that will stand up to the bland apathy of a generation of pundits and the status quo. In the sixties folk music mattered to a generation who needed to express a message.We need folk musicians now more than ever with something important to say that matters from a sincere place for a population that needs a voice. Thats what Dylan did and the literal opposite of what Mumford is doing with their whitewashed genre mashup.They are selling records and tickets to people who refuse to confront issues or challenge their minds with innovation in the form of organic music. They might as well be fucking robots and robots are not allowed to play folk music for the sake of all thats holy.What they make is the soundtrack to a commercial designed to capture ones attention in small doses without any sort of meaningful investment on the part of the listener.As critics have pointed out their songs are a manufactured lowest common denominator formula.',\n 'I raised this point in rPoliticalDiscussion and apparently its a controversial issue so I thought I would defend it here to expose myself to the arguments of the other side. This is not an issue I have studied in detail so I am open to having my mind changed.I think a Christian has a fairly easy time of deciding what to believe about abortion provided that they take the Bible to be inerrant. The Bible or the interpretation of the Bible that a suitable authority uses says that abortion is wrong so its always wrong. Maybe we could make a few exceptions in extreme cases like rape but it is certainly not acceptable to have an abortion to make the mothers life easier.An atheist on the other hand will typically have a very different epistemology. Most atheists will base their position on abortion on their perception of the evidence and their own moral convictions.',\n 'My reasoning is simple dishwashers require the dishes to be pre cleaned. This already defeats the purpose why did I pay hundreds of dollars for a machine that doesnt have food processing capabilities? dishwashers rarely removed ingrained or dried gunk. This only worsens when you charge the dishwasher over a couple of days and the older plates have already dried up. You have to take the still dirty plates and clean them manually. dishwashers dont properly dry deep items like Tupperware and pots if you arent careful taking these out youll get everything else wet once again making the process useless.

Additional damage could be inflicted with the breaking of upper limbs and the gouging of eyes.I dont believe that a velociraptors brain is equipped to deal with confrontations that involve more than simple pursuit or evasion. I believe they are fundamentally incapable of dealing with a dynamic combat event and thus could be relatively easily subdued by strategic fighting and basic wrestling.I believe their threat is largely overplayed in the media and that I personally would be able to best this particular dinosaur in unarmed single combat.

In a time when allegations of grade inflation run rampant an abundance of As and Bs in a course can raise redflags. Furthermore even if the courses are graded on curves so that the number of As and Bs is kept reasonably low employers and graduate programs may become skeptical of the rigor of an undergraduate program if they find that their .. students fizzle out. In both cases some students have their grades inflated and their otherwise impressive GPA is found to represent lackluster ability thereby reflecting negatively upon their peers some of whom may have actually earned that GPA.

My reasoning is that the amount of time Id save is less than seconds and the maximum penalty either being hit by a car or getting a ticket though rare is too high to justify such a small amount of time saved.

Imagine there is a hour old thread with comments in it and the top five comments are all mediocre comments that of people who read them upvote. Then someone posts an extremely high quality comment that over of people who read it upvote.',\n 'I first started thinking this when Rick Santorum made his infamous comments comparing homosexuality to bestiality. While this statement was obviously just pandering to a knee jerk emotional reaction to the idea of bestiality the reaction from the GRA Gay rights activists was surprising. While some lip service was payed to consent the emotion of the responses seemed to sum up as Bestiality is disgusting to me and homosexuality is not. Therefore the comparison is invalid and offensive. The consent idea was more of a rationalization and an afterthought.',\n 'Being born has two meanings when a child is expelled from the womb and when a new legal entity is recognized by the state.From Changing the definition of birth and when legal protections apply offers many benefits to parents and the state.If birth is not recognized until the birth certficate has been filed then parents can decide to discard damaged or unwanted babies which would be a legal abortion instead of an illegal murder.Fathers could opt out of child support by not signing the birth certicate. The number of single parent households would drop because the baby would not have been born until both parents sign the birth certificate. Until the baby has been born the birth certificate filed it would not be a citizen.Cases of misattributed paternity could be eliminated by requiring a paternity test before the father could sign the birth certificate. Prenatal genetic testing can identify paternity as an incidental finding. Birth certificates would identify the parents of the child and not the people intending to raise it so anonymous sperm and egg donation would be illegal.Prenatal paternity testing would allow for provisional filing of the legal birth certificate before the baby has been physically born.Babies that have been physically born but not legally born would be in a legal state similar to cohabiting couples who are not married.',\n 'My view is that in some situations a nazi comparison can be a useful and valid tool in an argument and that when such useful comparisons are made Godwins Law and other similar cultural memes serve only to make the discussion less fruitful. An example showed up earlier today in an rFoodforthought thread.uWestlondonwannabe saidTo which utvrr repliedutvrr was downvoted and people replied with comments about Godwins law and how you just cant compare the two. Now Im not saying that the comparison is exactly correct but rather that elucidating exactly how the death penalty is different from the holocaust i.e. actually responding to the content of the comparison rather than just dismissing it would be an important contribution to the conversation allowing us to more clearly understand the parameters under which uWestlondonwannabes statement is true which to me is at the heart of what people are trying to get from this discussion.On the other hand Im not saying that there are no circumstances under which Nazi comparisons can be wrongly used. Two examples that I think of immediately are Person A makes the comparison to which person B responds with This situation is different because... and then person A comes back with Oh so youre on the Nazis side? The comparison is The Nazis did X too when X has nothing to do with why people hate the Nazis.So go ahead and !',\n 'This is inspired by the question on the political compass that no matter how many times and after how many years between tests I always strongly agree with. In essence I believe that patriotism is foolish in that it is arbitrary thing to be proud of and leads only to problems such as sectarianism tribalism and conflict. For example I hold nothing against British people who happen to be born in the county that oppressed the country I happened to be born in. The conflict in northern Ireland as it stands with riots over parades and flagburning is patheticMoreover I think that if one decides that they are not responsible for the terrible actions of their government as they did not choose to be AmericanRussian they cannot deem themselves patriotic without being hypocritical. Since this sort of blew up I wanted to clarifyIm really only trying to get at the notion of being a proud nationality i.e. it is foolishit means nothing to be proud of ones heritage.I think you should only really be proud of something youve had a hand in making.',\n 'The first amendment prevents citizens from government intervention because of things they have saidCensorship is shutting someones freedom of speech down because you dont like what they are sayingIf you support upholding one you must support the otherYou do not have the right to not be offendedBoycotting a company because a head of theirs thinks things you dont like and arresting someone for the same reason is just as bad they both threaten a persons livelihood and if you do one you are welcoming the otherlouis sums it up better than I do',\n 'I consider myself a fair minded and objective gamer.

I believe that there exists a certain privacy in the doctors office that a judge or a police officer cannot go to ban any procedure that happens there...However I think that banning abortion will be a pointless exercise whose only affect will be to harm the women who still get abortions. Currently we should be thankful that we live in a age that women can get safe and effective abortions with minimal damage. I think that if tomorrow an abortion ban were affected that by the end of the day there will be just as many abortion clinics but they will all move undergound. And these underground abortions will harm women because they are operating below the law and there would be people who arent even trained in the medical field preforming these procedures.',\n 'Just as an example there have lately been a lot of laws passed restricting the ability to vote. There are or have been quite the assortment of laws on the books restricting various other civil rights from voting to abortion and everything in between. As it stands legislators with an illegitimate agenda have very little disincentive against passing unconstitutional abusive legislation. In fact they have every incentive to throw it all at the wall and see what sticks passing whatever laws they feel like and hoping they dont get challenged with no repercussions if they do get struck down and causing plenty of harm in the meantime.Legislators should not be doing this. Its unacceptable.',\n 'Let me start off with this idea If I dont know much about a subject and dont want to spend a very long time educating myself about it I think it is reasonable to listen to those who have spent all that time.

The Second Amendment was created with the intent to create a well regulated militia to defend from invasion and tyranny. The United States has come a long ways from the s and no nation could ever invade in this day and age due to the nuclear threat we pose and our massive army. I understand people keeping pistols for self defense but why would any one need something like an AR which is basically the same gun that the United States Military uses. why would anyone need a weapon like that in our day and age with advanced police forces and military. its not like you are going to be attacked by roving hoards of bandits. A stated reason for the Second Amendment is to resist tyranny but I dont think that is possible in this day and age as the modern US military would crush any resistance as they have the best tanks in the world try shooting an Abrams and the best air force. not to mention that few would seriously take up arms in America as we have it far too good. in the end i do not believe there is a valid reason for the second amendment as weapons such as assault rifles are pretty much unnecessary and even a liability as they have been used for horrible tragedies such as Sandy Hook and Aurora',\n 'I understand this might be suited to a different subreddit and that its a bit unconventional for a post here but I thought Id try here first. No idea what the response will be to this.Ive become dissatisfied with the model glorified by the pornsex industry that paints women as hairless and to me it seems odd to sleep withgo down on a lady who is bare down there. This has not always been the case there were times when it excited me as in when I was in my late teens and newish to sex but pubic hair simply seems like the natural way of things and I prefer a woman who trims over one who shaves. These days Im more attracted to a woman who doesnt even trim over one who waxes or shaves entirely. Bare vaginas just look unnatural to me and it has evolved into an actual turn off to get into bed with a partner who has one.Perhaps its a disillusionment with the disconnect between the real women I interact with wink wink nudge nudge know what I mean know what I mean? and the prevailing maledominated sex industrys image of perfection but I find myself labeled as a bush fetishist by many men I bring this up to.',\n 'I believe that it is equally unethical to kill soldiers as it is to kill anyone else.

I think this applies to all elections but to explain myself Ill just give a single example. The obvious example here would be the previous presidential election fought primarily between Obama Romney and Ron Paul. My opinions on Ron himself aside voting for a libertarian presidential candidate was a waste of a vote for anyone who chose to do so. I believe that anyone who at least when it got closer to election day honestly thought that Ron Paul would magically shoot up in ratings and somehow nab the election was either grossly misinformed or simply ignoring the facts in front of them.',\n 'I first came across this idea when I heard of Sam Harris. Ill quote from him Morality and values depend on the existence of conscious minds and specifically on the fact that such minds can experience various forms of wellbeing and suffering in this universe. Conscious minds and their states are natural phenomena of course fully constrained by the laws of Nature whatever these turn out to be in the end. Therefore there must be right and wrong answers to questions of morality and values that potentially fall within the purview of science. On this view some people and cultures will be right to a greater or lesser degree and some will be wrong with respect to what they deem important in life.I guess ultimately this is a very utilitarian moral philosophy essentially replacing good with wellbeing.',\n 'The internet or at least Reddit is filled with grammar Nazis people who point out spelling and grammatical errors with a passion no matter how minute and insignificant.

They always require some kind of special slot or pouch refusing to properly fit into traditional pouchless wallets.On the other hand flat notes are lightweight cheap to manufacture and spaceefficient.

Unfortunately the majority of people is scientific illiterate and cannot be easily convinced to support such strategies because they invariably involve some sacrifice here and now.Researchers try to be honest and say things like there is a small but significant chance that ocean level will raise and destroy Bangladesh as we know it. The risk is lets say in years Reality is we will not act on it even if acting would be logical and sound from an economic point of view alone. Sure we should improve education first but its not a fast process and in the meanwhile Bangladesh is at risk.

Thats true of course but I think it would make much more sense to simply study the English language directly.

An education in literature will also spend time to ensure that you able to understand archaic language find hidden meaning in fictional stories and identify important authors and books.

Many of both consoles nonexclusives have also been shown to underperform graphically when pitted against desktops made for the same price as them.The other point that I feel no longer separates consoles and PCs is their firmware and the need to constantly update it as well as patch games via internet.

Just because cannabis is potentially no more dangerous than other drugs does not mean it should be freely available. If anything someone admitting that alcoholtobacco are dangerous should be seeking to limit availabilitylegality of those drugs not adding new ones to the mix.I hold this view because the legalisation of cannabis will add to the global health burden and treatment of diseases associated with cannabis use will divert funds away from other areas.

While an army of selfarmed patriotic citizens fighting the oppressive government sounds romantic they could simply not contend with tanks jets guided missiles and even flying robots.

What I am disputing is the phenomenon of dismissing a common belief or behavior as just a social construct as if social constructs are totally arbitrary and have no deeper significance. My position is that these constructs must necessarily have arisen out of natural factors and that those natural factors are still around today.My reasoning for this is that social influence could not always have been in play hundreds of thousands of years ago there was no such thing as language and thus social constructs could not exist.
