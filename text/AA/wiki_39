To track the movement of these particles across the United States, the research team established a reduced-complexity model, which can complete analyses faster than traditional models, so the team's study could encompass nearly all the United States' power plants.\nParticulate matter in the air, like that produced at power plants, can cause lung problems, heart attacks and stroke, which then lead to premature death. In the United States alone, particulate matter is indirectly responsible for reportedly upwards of 100,000 deaths annually.\nAccording to the study, in 2014 in the continental United States, roughly 16,000 premature deaths were attributable to power plants, an estimated 91% of those from coal. The researchers also found in 36 states most of the people who died were affected by pollution generated in another state.

We also consider how emissions can react in the atmosphere to form fine particle air pollution [...] That gave us a map of pollution concentrations across the country. Then we overlaid that map with data from the census to get an estimate of where people live and how this pollution results in health impacts.\"\nEven after the researchers adjusted their data for economic factors, premature deaths from this type of pollution were stratified by race, with the highest likelihood for black Americans, at a rate of seven per 100,000 people. They were followed by non-Latino white Americans at six per 100,000; for all other racial groups in the country, there were only four premature deaths per 100,000. Income did affect people's level of exposure but to a far less pronounced extent, a difference of one per 100,000 between annual incomes below US$10,000 versus above $200,000.\nAnother co-author, civil and environmental engineering professor Julian Marshall, said, \"We've seen in our previous research that our society is more segregated by race than by income, and now it's showing up again with air pollution from electricity generation emissions [...] These results can help local, state or national governments make more informed decisions that will improve everyone's air quality and quality of life.\" \nMarshall noted, \"It's especially relevant these days because of what the federal government is doing \u2014 or actually not doing \u2014 around air pollution and around these issues in general[.]\""}

Over 80% of the 452 available district council seats went to pro-democracy candidates, often ousting pro-Beijing candidates, giving them control of 17 out of 18 of the area's districts.\nThe district council is the only level of Hong Kong government that is, as news sources noted, completely democratic, and the councilors make up about a tenth part of the body that elects the chief executive of Hong Kong. Most councilors' duties involve action at the neighborhood level, like maintaining parks, arranging trash collection, and dealing with pests, which in at least one case involved wild boars.\nAlthough Hong Kong's district elections are, reportedly, usually quiet, this year not even one district council candidate ran unopposed. The turnout was about 71%, some 25% higher than last year.\nVoter Kitty Mak told \"\", \"Today we are trying to do the best we can for Hong Kong right now. Every little step matters [...] It is a protest vote against an authoritarian government; we cannot tolerate this government's policies anymore.\"\n political scientist Ma Ngok said the turnout was seen as public support of the protesters who have demonstrated in Hong Kong since June. He noted, \"The government and the pro-Beijing camp have always claimed they have public support [...] But now [...] this is a big slap in the face because the public has showed their real position in record numbers.\"\nThe city has been home to intense, occasionally violent pro-democracy protests since June of this year, some of which have shut down parts of the city. The protests began after the Hong Kong government proposed an amendment to a law to allow the government of mainland China to extradite anyone accused of a crime to the mainland to be prosecuted under the Chinese judicial system, but the motivation behind the events have expanded to include demands for investigations into police brutality and a more representative form of democracy within Hong Kong government.\nAbout 2.9 million people voted in Sunday's election. The total population of Hong Kong is about 7.5 million."}

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States, one out of every thousand children who contract measles develop , which can cause deafness or brain damage.\nMeasles is one of several diseases that drastically reduced the indigenous population of Pacific island nations and the Americas after first contact with Europeans. The first measles vaccine was introduced in the 1960s, and the incidence dropped, in some cases to almost zero, in parts of the world in which its use became widespread. It has since seen a resurgence partly due to vaccine hesitancy and vaccine inaccessibility."}

He had orchestrated attacks on coalition bases in Iraq over the last several months \u2013 including the attack on December 27th \u2013 culminating in the death and wounding of additional American and Iraqi personnel. General Soleimani also approved the attacks on the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad that took place this week. This strike was aimed at deterring future Iranian attack plans.

In a statement following the attack, Ahmed al-Assadi, a spokesman for the PMF, blamed both Israel and the United States for the attack. As of January 3, no evidence of Israeli involvement has been reported.\nThe (IRGC), which includes the Quds Force, declared that Soleimani was \"martyred\" by the airstrike. , the Supreme Leader of Iran, ordered three days of public mourning after the strike. In his message, he appreciated Soleimani's lifepath: \"He was a stellar example of those educated and nurtured in Islam and the school of Imam Khomeini (ra). He spent his entire life engaging in jihad in the path of God. Martyrdom was his reward for years of implacable efforts [...] Soleymani is the international face of the resistance and all who have a heart-felt connection to the resistance seek his blood revenge.\"\nIn his statement, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu found the air strike justified and called Trump's order swift, forceful and decisive.\nThe United States Embassy in Iraq had suspended operations, and advised U.S. citizens to leave the country immediately in its January 3 security alert. The office asked U.S. citizens not approach the Embassy, and if in need for travel documents, to use the consulate in .\n, the acting Prime Minister of Iraq, spoke out against the attack, calling it \"an aggression on Iraq as a state, government and people\" as well as a violation of the rules relating to the presence of United States troops in Iraq.\nIn 2007, the United States government labeled Soleimani as a terrorist and levied sanctions against him. He was further sanctioned in 2011 in relation to a plot to kill the Saudi Arabian ambassador to the United States. Last April, the also designated the IRGC as a terrorist organization.

In regard of clashing claims, he noted \"it is important to point out that the agreement signed between Turkey and Libya infringe upon Greece\u2019s sovereign rights\". \nOn last Thursday, the delegations of Cyprus, Greece and Israel had met for their seventh trilateral summit, that time in Athens at the , to sign an agreement to construct the EastMed pipeline by 2025. The meeting was attended by Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu and energy minister , Greek prime minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis and energy minister , and Cypriot president and energy minister Georgios Lakkotrypis. The agreement was signed by the energy ministers. Greek daily \"\" said Greece and Cyprus had to speed up to counter possible Turkish interference with the project.\nEarlier that day, the Greek gas producer signed a letter of intent on selling two billion cubic meters of gas per year to the Greek gas supplier . The planned pipeline capacity is 10 billion cubic meters per year. Energean has committed 1.7 billion dollars in the Karish and Tanin fields.\nWith this forming of political and economic alliance with Hellenic countries, Netanyahu envisioned the pipeline to end their \"fringe country\" status. Netanyahu called on Italy and Egypt to join the project, adding \"We call on any other country that wishes to join us to do so\". In Cyprus, the ruling in Cyprus hailed the pipeline as an advancement in the nation's sovereignty. , the main opposition force, underlined that the agreement is only a legal framework, and actual construction is in the hands of still undecided private investors. Turkish Foreign Ministry spokesman Hami Aksoy underlined Turkish and Turkish Cypriot mining rights in the region, and projected a failure if these would be overlooked. \n, Italy is a proposed end point for the pipeline, and Italian economic development minister sent a letter of support prior to the signing, but the minister said they are to build another pipeline to , Greece. The United States expressed its support via the December 20 signing of the Eastern Mediterranean Bill, a July 25 quadrilateral meeting in Washington, and sent Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to join the trilateral meeting of EastMed countries on March 20 last year. The EU partially funded the feasibility studies, as it considers the EastMed pipeline to be a Project of Common Interest (PCI), ending the energy isolation of and Cyprus, and diversifying the gas supply of Europe, when completed.\nIn December, a Turkish official said that the , which is already up and running, renders the EastMed building effort unnecessary, reported. On November 27, Turkey and Libya signed a maritime border agreement, according to which a section between Crete and Cyprus would cross the Turkish economic zone. Athens expelled the Libyan ambassador to Greece over this issue. Turkey maintains a position that only Northern Cyprus, which is recognized only by Turkey, has the right to the exclusive economic zone around the island. Because of its drilling operations there, Turkey is already under EU sanctions, and was condemned in a joint statement by Egypt, Greece and Cyprus on October 8.\nIn 2017, a memorandum of understanding about the pipeline was signed between Cyprus, Greece and Israel.\nAccording to the Cyprus Mail, the 2000 km long pipeline is to connect the fields with Crete, the Greek mainland, and would end in Otranto, Italy. The May 2019 map of gas routes by Gas Infrastructure Europe draws the pipeline between the and , Greece, where it merges with the en route to Italy.\nAlex Lagakos, deputy director of the \"Greek Energy Forum\", said the project has a geopolitical significance rather than an economic one. He called it unlikely that the EU would finance the project, as it has committed itself to green energy. The estimated cost is six billion euros, but the saturation of the gas markets and competition from liquid natural gas (LNG) terminals are likely to keep private investors away, he noted. Egypt has two usable terminals in the Nile-Delta, in and . On September 19, 2018, Cyprus and Egypt had signed an alternative deal to export Aphrodite gas through these ports via a new pipeline.\n geostrategy expert and former Israeli security official, Avinoam Idan, said the new EastMed supply can't be considered a significant geopolitical change to Europe's energy market, as it would not affect the market share of Russian gas. In the analysis of the , the high costs and technical challenges render the project unrealistic.\nDuring the trilateral meeting of Cyprus, Greece and Israel on January 28, 2016, the then-envisioned was considered as an alternative route to export the gas as electricity. The 1000 megawatt underwater cable connecting the three power grids is to be completed by December 2023. The estimated cost is 2.5 billion euros, and the EU considers it a PCI. , a similar project between Greece, Cyprus and Egypt, is also in its planning stage."}

These limitations were posted as messages on the checkouts, and on the chains' Facebook pages. Buyers were reportedly stocking up due to fears of COVID-19 in case people need to self-isolate. On Wednesday, Woolworths also limited toilet paper purchases for home delivery to one pack per order.\nThese changes followed the previous four-pack per transaction restriction introduced by Woolworths and Coles on March 4 and 5 respectively. Coles, in its March 8 media release, reported that with the four-pack restriction in place, \"many stores are still selling out within an hour of delivery\", and called the demand \"unprecedented\", while ALDI, in a Facebook post on Tuesday, called it \"unexpected\". Sales went up in a \"sharp increase\" last week, according to a Woolworths spokesperson. 's store in Canberra also limited the allowed amount to two packs last week. \nTo further alleviate the shortage, Coles ordered bigger packages from suppliers and increased delivery frequency, Woolworths ordered extra stock, while ALDI made stocks for a planned Wednesday special available early. Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the , said that retailers try to raise stock, but local council restrictions on the timing of truck-deliveries make it hard. He expects rising production costs, as suppliers try to meet demand, and fewer specials. On Tuesday, ALDI announced that following the early release of stock, some stores can't run the Wednesday special.\nIn a \"\" report, Dr Gary Mortimer, retail expert from , said the stores fill the stock every night. He remarked toilet paper is a bulky item, leading to low quantity of stocks in numbers, and, when sold out, leaves vast shelf spaces empty, hardening the feeling of a shortage. \"Coles and Woolworths have a view [that] if there was plenty of stuff on the shelf, if product like toilet rolls and sanitiser could be [bought] and are there in quantities, you would probably minimise the panic\" said Russell Zimmerman per \"ABC News\".\nRecycled toilet paper producer \"Who Gives a Crap\" said on last Wednesday they'd run out of stock. , which makes Kleenex Toilet Tissue, and Solaris Paper which makes Sorbent, emphasized they were working 24/7 to maintain the supply, according to the \"News.com.au\" report.\nDomain.com, a real estate site, reported some property sellers offering free toilet paper to the first bidder on auctions in Melbourne, when fewer auctions were held because of buyers having time off on the long weekend of . The Thursday edition of \"\", a daily printed in , included an eight-page insert meant to be cut up and used as toilet paper.\nThe stores were originally reluctant to impose restrictions, according to a report from ABC Australia on March 3 in which they said they had no plans to introduce restrictions on the purchases.\nRussell Zimmerman added that other products are also in high demand, including masks, sanitiser, dried goods, handwash and flour. Similarly, outside of Australia, on Sunday evening online British supermarket was observed limiting purchases of toilet paper to two 12-roll packs."}

The state-run Indian Railways launched this event ahead of International Women's Day, for promoting gender equality at work places. Aparna Garg \u2014 who has been the Divisional Railway Manager (DRM) for Mysore Division for almost two years \u2014 discussed this initiative with \"Wikinews\". International Women's Day is observed on March 8.\nInterview.\n Good afternoon, ma'am. Thank you for agreeing to this interview. Allow me to congratulate Mysuru Division for this all-women crew \u2014 the crew which ran the Tippu Express from Mysore to Bangalore on Thursday. How many employees were there in this all-women crew?\n There were fifteen of them. A crew per-se combines only the loco pilot (locomotive pilot) and the guard. But all the people who ran [the train], it includes the ticket checking staff, the escort staff, the RPF (Railway Police Force) staff. So combining everybody, it was around fifteen people.\n How rare is it to have all-women crew running the train?\n Yeah, it is really rare. Actually, we are in a process of a ten-day campaign for International Women's Day and we have lined up one activity each day. So this initiative was a part of that campaign.\n Was it the first time an all-women crew ran the train in the Southern Western Railway?\n No, not really. It has been done in other divisions as well. Mysore, maybe the first time.\n Has it ever happened before in any other regional divisions which you are aware of?\n I think in Bangalore they did a little bit. Whether it was all-women, but they did run a train. And all-India basis also they have done.\n Could you please tell us more about this feat, and when was this planned?\n As I told you, that we have a ten-day campaign running for International Women's Day, the theme of which is \"Each for Equal\". And \"Each for Equal\" is basically each of us can contribute in creating a gender-equal world. Each area they [women] are working, it is not getting highlighted at all. There are basically male-dominated areas where earlier women were not coming. But nowadays, we see in large number, the women come. And in railways, these are [rare] works: loco pilot, working as a keyman; keyman means basically it is designation \"keyman\" but when woman works, it could be keywoman: they have to patrol on the tracks. So there are these people who are working so hard, [?] checking the trains completely. So that is why we decided to give it publicity and make it an all-women crew.\n Was this event planned by the Southern Western Railway, or was it an Indian Railways initiative?\n This was an initiative of Mysore Division. Mysore Division is a part of South Western Railway.\n What has the Indian Railways planned for this International Women's Day?\n They have given a theme of different things to be done. The campaign theme, as I told you, \"Each for Equal\", which can significantly and collectively, each one of us can help create a gender-equal world.\nAnd from 1st of March to 10th of March we have to celebrate, then we have to organise some talks, lectures; then, basically, anything which comes in the public purview to highlight the steps taken by Indian Railways for the empowerment of women, enhancing the role of women in all fields. And [...] basically take steps for the female staff of our division. Social media posts we have to do of whatever we are doing [for the celebration]. Women-specific videos, we have to add.\nWhat we are doing in Mysore division, we did a couple of activities: [...] we had a medical check-up, specifically screening for cervical cancer. Not only for the staff working in the office, but also for the contract staff. The cleaning staff which you see on the station, they are not permanent employees. And they don't have access to good health. There are a lot of ladies working there. Today, I took a lot of ladies who were working in the division office as well as our field for a trek to . So we went [in the] morning there. And tomorrow we have some event planned.\n Could you please tell us about this year's theme, the celebration of Women's Day, and how is it different from last year's?\n Last year, it was basically focused on the particular day, 8th [March] alone. The idea of spreading it over ten days is very significant.\n What are the activities planned in this phase?\n Basically our aim is to encourage lot of participation by women employees in different activities other than their office work, so they get a break. This is for our own employees. Promote them. Encourage them. Create awareness about their own talent. Like, within the office, we organised \"pick-and-speak\" or some things like that and a lot of such events, where we found that even our Group D staff are so talented, some of them. So basically giving them a break from their routine. That was one for our female employees. And we are trying to take care of the staff that are working at the station as well as to the women passengers providing enhanced security.\n Would you call this event a success?\n Yeah, so far, yes.\n What are the challenges faced by women working for Indian Railways?\n Challenges, I would say, are the same as you find in the society. For a women to achieve something, is not as easy as it is for a man. They have to put double the effort, and the recognition comes very late. And then women are multi-tasking everywhere. So a lady who comes to work in the office: first sees her house and then she comes [to work] and then again she goes back and she does [household work]. So she is much more pressure, and I find them very sincere. Despite all the pressure, I find them extremely sincere and dedicated.\n What are the possible remedies to these issues?\n Issues are basically: celebration of Women's Day and all these events, they do bring women in focus. But what is required at large is a change in the society and the mindset, which should begin in each house. And if we have boys in the house and we have male colleagues, we have to sensitise them more. And so that, once we have the support of these people and their mindset changes, and that is how we can influence the collective consciousness.\n What is the gender-distribution ratio at the Mysore Division branch?\n Mysore Division, we have ten percent only women employees. Out of a total of, say, 6900 [employees], we have around 650. So that is around ten percent.\n Are you happy with this number?\n Yeah, it is okay. See, the idea is: each according to their choice. The people who have chosen [to work here] have gotten. I personally don't believe in this too much of gender-bias. They are all individuals.\n Has this number been improving in the past years?\n It has improved. It has improved, it was around seven or eight percent, over the two years it has increased. More number of women getting into technical fields has been a big change. Earlier it wasn't coming. You would find in office staff, okay, which is a ministerial cadre. But now, getting women employees in loco pilot category, in station masters, as guards, as pointswoman: they are all working [on] track, as carriage and wagon helpers. So yes, there has been a change.\n[Women] loco pilots are coming in a big wave. And it is not a very difficult job. The duty hours is eight-hours. So once they cover eight hours, they change. So it is not that in some remote areas they have to drive. No. Eight hours, their shift changes. So if a loco pilot starts from here, maybe at or some place, they will change. So we have something called running rooms, where the have all the facilities. So they deboard there, and after taking due rest, they take a train back to their home place. So yes, ladies are coming in a big wave.\n What are the steps Indian Railways is taking for improving this number?\n There is not [gender-based] reservation per-se, [from] what I know, but Indian [Railways] has been very open about it. Now you see DRM's, I am sitting here. There was a time when the number of ladies who'd become DRM was very less. So now, we have around 60 division, maybe eight are women. So the numbers: everywhere it is going up. It has been very positive about it.\n Can you brief me your role as Mysore Divisional Railway Manager?\n As Divisional Railway Manager, I am in charge of all the operations, all the train running, and my division is around 1300 route . It extends from . It goes right up to, just short of up to . And on the other side, next to . It starts and then goes up to this side. Including and some more branch lines are there which goes up to and goes up to . So this is my jurisdiction. I have a set of 30 officers with me. A lot of supervisors and other staff. Total staff, I told you, is around 6900 for Mysore division. And controlling everyday basically taking the team along, taking decisions, small-small decisions which help in running of the train, carrying out all the initiatives and directions of the ministry is my job.\n For how long have you been working here as the Mysore Division Railway Manager?\n I will be completing my two years' tenure in April.\n Can you please brief me about your career highlights so far?\n My career highlights have been opting for civil services at a very young age, in my first attempt was [the] first important step in my career. Otherwise in my student days there were many things that I did. I was a student leader. I had other achievements. But coming to the career, and thereafter, I [had] initially joined . But then came down to South, and I worked in different capacities. Then, after a few years into the service, I was selected for the Chevening Fellowship in [the] UK, where I did my advanced masters and postgraduate in . That was a big achievement because very few years into service having been selected for that: it was a completely scholarship programme, I did not have to pay for it. So that was a big achievement. Then, while I was posted in the construction wing, making a software programme for: making means piloting a system [which was] Oracle-based for project management. It was integrated with personal management system as well as store's . So piloting that completely, that I would call it as a big highlight. And then getting posted as a Divisional Railway Manager: there were a lot of challenges. Challenge was: the railway station which you see, it was a big project. Working station, improving that, improving the circulating area and then retaining the heritage, and enhancing it faced a lot of flak and opposition also. Because when we do the work, everything looks like in the stage of construction. So you get all type[s] of things. And then still continuing to do; and I have taken a few more challenging works in the division. One is adjacent to our sports ground, there is [an] area which is not very clean. So I have decided to clean it up and make it an ecospace. That project we are working on. The railway museum, which is a must-visit for people, and it's been a 40 years old museum. [In 19]79-80 it was established in a small area. After that, it has not been taken care of so much that the condition was not good. And this was a sanctioned project ten years back. But work had not happened. It was very very challenging what we have done. And we are soon going to open it on 14th. [...] Even Mysore Yard remodelling. We were not able to push our trains from all the platforms towards -side. And we were not able to simultaneously receive train from Hassan-side and SBC ()-side. If a train from Bangalore-side is coming, that would stop. So there were a lot of yard changes which had to be done. Including our interlocking software. This was also very challenging which required a year of planning. We did this successfully. So like this, there were small-small works which were all pending, and which were not done. So we have done a very comprehensive work. But credit will go to the team also.\n How is South West Railway and Mysore Division taking precaution against the spread of coronavirus?\n My CMD [Chief Health Director], I have been talking to her everyday. We have an isolation ward in the hospital but at the station, I think, we are playing a clip about the precautions to be taken. If we come to know, we should take more cautions. Basically the citizens have travelled to these places: like China, South Korea and people from the far East have been coming. So we should announce and we should isolate them. We are yet to put a segregated space in station. That we have not done. But I think, announcements and all we are doing. And if I come to know here, masks and all: we are distributing. And more important is here, the staff who is dealing with the public on a daily basis like out ticket collectors and guards and all, they have been given masks.\n Thank you very much. That would be all the questions I had for you."}

According to the WHO's situation report dated March 16, the virus claimed 6606 lives, and 167,515 cases were reported of this disease. The WHO's website said: \"While some western, traditional or home remedies may provide comfort and alleviate symptoms of COVID-19, there is no evidence that current medicine can prevent or cure the disease. The WHO does not recommend self-medication with any medicines, including antibiotics, as a prevention or cure for COVID-19.\"\nHowever, addressing the global leaders, Chakrapani proposed: \"I request all the presidents and prime ministers of the world to take cow urine on a daily basis. You have all these scientists who don't know the cure, we have the cure given to us by the gods\".\nChakrapani had said, Earlier this month, Chakrapani told \"\", \"Just like we organise tea parties, we have decided to organise a \"gaumutra\" party, wherein we will inform people about what is coronavirus and how, by consuming cow-related products, people can be saved from it\".\nCows are considered by Hindus and politicians of the Hindu-nationalist party Bharatiya Janta Party had previously cited the medicinal benefits of cow urine.

Ohio, which was also scheduled to hold a primary election, delayed its voting in the face of the national emergency around the spread of the COVID-19 disease. The same day, incumbent President of the United States Donald Trump became the Republican Party's presumptive nominee for the 2020 United States presidential election after winning the party's primaries in Florida and Illinois.\nThe Democratic and Republican Parties use primary elections, along with , to select their nominees for the 2020 presidential election. For a candidate to win the Democratic Party's nomination, a total of at least 1,991 delegates are needed. The three primary elections the Democratic party held represented a total of 441 delegates.\nBiden's victories in Arizona, Florida, and Illinois left him with a reported total of 1,124 pledged delegates; United States Senator from Vermont Bernie Sanders trailed him with a total of 815. In the 2016 United States presidential election, Sanders also lost in all three of these states to Hillary Clinton. The Democratic Party awards delegates proportionally to how candidates fare; candidates must receive at least 15% of the vote to be eligible to earn delegates from a state, territory, or district within a state or territory.\nOn the Republican side, 1,276 delegates are required to secure the nomination. After winning the Republican Party's primaries in Florida and Illinois on Tuesday, Trump reportedly amassed 1,330 delegates, more than the number needed, making him the Republican Party's presumptive nominee.\nIn Ohio, which was planning to hold its primary election on Tuesday, Governor Mike DeWine postponed it, citing the health crisis. In a two-part statement on Twitter, he wrote, \"During this time when we face an unprecedented public health crisis, to conduct an election tomorrow would force poll workers and voters to place themselves at an unacceptable health risk of contracting coronavirus.\" He continued by announcing, \"As such, @DrAmyActon will order the polls closed as a health emergency. While the polls will be closed tomorrow, Secretary of State @FrankLaRose will seek a remedy through the courts to extend voting options so that every voter who wants to vote will be granted that opportunity.\"\nDeWine's decision comes a few days after President Trump declared a national emergency in response to the ongoing coronavirus outbreak.

The federation announced their decision although Dorsa Derakhshani had previously decided and informed the chess federation she did not wish to play for Iran.\nDorsa Derakhshani is currently 21 years old and holds the (IM) as well as (WGM) titles. Her brother, Borna, plays for the and holds the title.\nDorsa Derakhshani was banned since she did not wear a \"hijab\", an Islamic headscarf, while competing at the in January 2017. Under the laws of Islamic Republic of Iran, \"hijab\" is a mandatory dress code. Her brother Borna Deraskhsani was banned for playing against Israeli (GM) at the same tournament. Iran does not recognise the existence of Israel, and previously, Irani athletes have avoided playing against Israeli athletes.\nMehrdad Pahlavanzadeh, the president of the country's chess federation, explained the decision to ban the players saying, He further stated, \nIM Dorsa Derakhshani, who currently studies at in the United States and plays for the , discussed her chess career, time in Iran and the 2017 controversy, and her life in Saint Louis with a \"Wikinews\" correspondent.\nInterview with IM Dorsa Derakhshani.\nIM Dorsa Derakhshani grew up in Tehran, and she had learned to read and write at a very young age because her parents were \"persistent\" about her education. She remarked lack of chess tournaments in a country where \"women are seen as second-class citizens\" was one of the challenges she'd faced living in Iran.\nHer childhood.\n Could you please tell us something about yourself?\n I'm a professional chess player and right now I'm a student at Saint Louis University.\n What interested you in chess and who taught you this game?\n I got interested in chess because of my dad. He used to play in high school before the . But since after the revolution chess was banned for about ten years. So he couldn't play in public, so he would just play in the house and I remember he used to play with my mom. And, yeah, that's how I learned chess.\n What do your parents do?\n My dad is a doctor, he is a p\u00e6diatrist and family medicine. My mom is a psychiatrist.\n How was your childhood like?\n I was the first child, so they, my parents put a lot of effort into teaching me a lot of different skills. So, for example, my parents really wanted me to start writing and solving puzzles as soon as possible. So when I was two-and-a-half, I finished first grade. I could do maths and read the books and write. And they kept going. So when I was a little over four, I finished fourth grade. And so they wanted me to start fifth grade when I was five but the government didn't really have any protocols for this so they didn't allow me to skip classes. And so my parents tried to fill my time with other activities such as , painting, music, swimming, and eventually chess. And chess was the one thing that I [jumped for consistently] because I really liked puzzle-solving and I really liked the winning, the competition.\n How did you train as a kid?\n I always wanted to be the best at everything I was doing, and chess had the clear category of what I was best at. And I really liked that. Because for example in ballet or in painting, I was good, but, I wasn't sure what I was good at, just, was I good just for a kid my age, was I good just for the class I was in. And in chess, one of the first tournaments that I played, I won the Girl's Under-8 National Championship. So I knew clearly, I felt like clearly I was best at that. And, yeah, I was very ambitious and competitive, I don't know why.\n When did you realise you were a serious talent?\n My middle and my high school, I went to the organisation which is called . It's an acronym for, hold on, let me look that up. It's called the National Organization for Extraordinary something. I will look that up in just a second. So I knew that I had the ambition and I had the brain because I used to be a TV host when I was a kid and it was always very easy for me. It wasn't very stressful. I didn't have to do too many preparation because of the confidence that my parents gave me. Ah, the name of the school that I went to, on Wikipedia, it's National Organization for Development of Exceptional Talents. So we had to do an exam, somewhat like an , in fifth grade. And we would get into these schools and it was very hard to balance school and chess. And that's around the time that I stopped playing music and I stopped giving concerts and just started to focus on school and chess.\n Who inspires you in chess?\n I really liked the three sisters of Polg\u00e1r, 'specially . Just because she kept on going and she didn't just want to be the best female chess player. She was in top 10. She was one of the first to break the barriers of gender, especially in chess society. So yeah, she would be.\n Tell me about your most memorable tournament.\n She [Judit Polg\u00e1r] played so many. She hasn't been playing much in [the] past few years because she is focused on family, which I also respect a lot because I am a big family-person myself, so I completely understand that. Her most memorable, it's really hard to pick. She played so many high class tournaments.\n I meant \"your\" most memorable.\n Oh. My. I want to go with my first time, the first tournament that I won. The Iranian National Championship for girls Under-8. Because that was one of the changing moments and I remember I wore like a princess dress and a because it felt like a very powerful time for me.\n What is your favourite game? Could be yours, or could be someone else's.\n Favourite game. Um, I play a lot of online chess and lot of good positions and good tactics happens there but I don't really know the name of the opponents.\n Tell me about the challenges you had faced as a chess prodigy living in Iran.\n Well one of the big challenges was that there weren't enough tournaments. Because in Iran, women are seen as second-class citizens, so, I wasn't allowed, and women weren't allowed to play, in open tournaments. And there weren't enough women chess players to organise a big event. And so when I was growing up and I was eight, we started \u2014 my parents started to request that okay, she is a good child, she should be able to play in male-based tournaments, basically. And they weren't even female tournaments, they were just tournaments. And so when I was eight, and when I was ten, they allowed the children, like the girl childs to play, which was kind of awkward. And then they came up with more flexible rules, like if you are in the national team, you can play whatever tournament you want, if you win your category. But still. It was very .\n You mentioned you were a TV anchor as a kid. Tell us more about that.\n Oh, so, one day I was singing and dancing in a mall, just, I don't know why, I liked that, when I was two. And a TV producer saw me and really liked my confidence. So they gave me the opportunity to co-host a TV show for kids. And to try [to] inspire and motivate them to read and write to do other activities. And I did that up until I was six years old, a little over two months and I was six. And I quit because they wanted me to change the way I was dressing and start wearing \"hijab\" and start not wearing dresses and stuff. And I thought that was stupid. So I didn't go anymore and my parents fully supported my decision to stop the co-hosting.\n You also learned to read at a very young age.\n Yep. Yeah that was all due to my parents. They were very persistent with my education.\n How was your personality like, in your childhood?\n Oh, my mom sometimes makes fun that I was like a child robot, that I was always saying what I was thinking. And I was always very confident and just talking and trying to, I quote, she said, \"boss people around\" \u2014 as a two-year-old, which was kind of adorable. [laughs] But I was always very competitive and, yeah: that was something that my parents gave me. My parents [... to] have that potential to want to inspire other people.\nHer decision to not play for the Irani Chess Federation.\nHaving won multiple tournaments as a kid, IM Dorsa Derakhshani decided not to play for the Iranian Chess Federation saying \"it wasn't a good fit\" for her.\n Early in your life you had decided you didn't want to play for Iran.\n Yep. I made that decision around [...] two-thousand, so 2011, 12, 13, 14 were the years that I won Asia National Championships and Youth National Championships. And I just didn't really fit with any of the teammates or any of the people from my federation. And they all expected so much time and energy to try and, for the lack of better words, kiss their asses. I just don't have a better word to put there. And so I refused to do that because I was busy with school and busy with chess, and I refused to go there and sit and have weekly meetings about I don't even know what, not chess-related. So it wasn't a good fit for me.\n And I was looking for immigration even before that because most of my family lives outside of Iran. Not my immediate family but my aunts and cousins from both of my parents' sides. So we were looking for immigration from early on, but I wanted to see if I could grow as a chess player within chess in Iranian Chess Federation but, when I was sure that it was not a good fit, is when I started to look for another federation and decided not to play for Iran anymore. And the last time I officially played for Iran in an official tournament was 2015. And in 2016, I immigrated to Spain to see if that federation and country would be a good fit for to live in and play chess for. But when I was trying to make a decision if I should transfer my federation to Spain or stay with Iran, I received scholarship offers from US colleges and I decided to immigrate here and play for US federation.\n If Iran did not impose the compulsory observation of the headscarf, would you have, in that case, chosen to play for Iran?\n I don't think it was about the headscarf because that's just a piece of clothing. I mean, every job has a dress-code. So it wasn't just about the headscarf, it was more about the way the society viewed women and how hard I as a woman had to fight. I had to work like ten times harder than a man just to be seen as half as good as him, while I understood more and it should have been different. It should \u2014 I mean the women face inequality in so many places but I decided instead of fighting in a country where I wouldn't have enough voice, I would immigrate to another country where I would have a better voice and a better future.\n Back then, did your younger brother Borna also decide not to play for Iran?\n He also wanted to immigrate, but he wanted to see which country. He wasn't sure \u2014 Because my family still do have a pending immigration case to come to the US. So he wasn't sure if he would want to wait until after immigration to start playing for the US, or he would want to play for a European Federation. But since he is going to boarding school in UK, he switched his federation very quickly.\n When did you inform the Iranian Chess Federation about your decision?\n Early 2016. Because they wanted me to play different tournaments for them, team tournaments. Because I would be their solid second board because I was Women Grand Master and then International Master in 2016. So they wanted me to represent their country. And I flat completely refused and I said that I'm in Spain and I'm working to transfer federations and I don't want to play for Iran anymore. So I was in, for example, in 2016 [chess] Olympiad in , I refused to play for Iran National Team and I chose to work as press for the French Chess websites. And I was there. I just didn't play for the team. I went there on my own and I met with my family.\n So how long did you represent Iran at the chess tournaments?\n Well, I stopped representing them in 2015. And, well, I did play in an international tournament in 2006. So I played World Youths in 2006, so I would say nine years? Less that ten years, yeah.\n Had the federation ever warned you to cover your hair?\n Well, I quote, they said \"Even if you are not wearing the headscarf, like on your head, at least have it around your neck\", and I just thought that was extremely stupid because they [the Iranian Chess Federation] wanted this to cover their asses. So if there was a picture, they would say, \"Oh, it [the head covering] just fell\". And it was like, if I don't believe in something, why would I bother faking it? And that whole idea of, like, \"put the scarf around your neck and if somebody sees, just, like, put it up, put it down\". That was extremely stupid. But that's something that other female chess players in the team have been doing for years. And most of them have already immigrated out of Iran anyways.\n Were there any other regulations [Iranian] female chess players had to adhere to?\n Oh yeah, well the classic \"no parties\", \"no alcohol\", \"no contact with men\", blah blah blah, which we all broke anyways, but.\n After deciding you won't play for Iran, what did you do?\n I, in 2015 I was trying to figure out which federation to go, which country to represent. Switzerland was one of my choices. But it [fell] through just because \u2014 it was very complicated. I did want to represent the country of Switzerland, and they did want me to represent them. So I would be their highest female [rated player]. I would be their board one. But it was really hard to fit a good educational system for me and I didn't speak other languages besides English and I needed to be able to speak German or French or something else in Switzerland to be able to live and that was a big problem for me. So I ended up moving to Spain and seeing if that would be the country I would keep living in and I only lived there for a year before I decided to move to US.\nHer career in chess.\n How was your time in Chess Club?\n Very nice. They were very nice people. They helped with a lot of things. They helped me find a place. They helped me find good tournaments. They had good tournaments themselves. I think one of the big tournaments didn't happen last year, but hopefully it will happen this year. Yeah, it was a very growing chess club.\n After immigrating to the US, have you been to Spain again?\n No I haven't had the chance because mainly I am very busy with studying because I am pre-med student and the other problem was that I didn't have my at the time. I got my green card last summer. And I went to South America for a tournament: Panama. I also went to Munich for the talk last summer, and no I haven't been to Spain.\n Tell me about your success at the Iranian National Youth under-8 tournament.\n I don't really remember much from the games. But I do remember I scored eight wins and one loss. And that's how I won the tournament. I didn't really have a coach while the other girls did. And I don't really remember anything else besides the closing ceremony and how much I scored.\n Tell us about your participation in the Asian Junior Championships.\n That's actually around the time I started to think of chess as more possible career. So the first, 2011, was in Philippines. I got the first runner-up. Second one was 2012 in Sri Lanka, I believe. Yeah. And I won that one. The third one was in Iran. Yeah, in 2013. I won that. '14 was in India: New Delhi. After I won that, I just didn't play in the Asian Championship in 2015 anymore, just because I kind of won it a few times already.\n Were you supposed to observe the regulations of Iranian Chess Federation at the Asian Junior Championships as well?\n Yeah, because those were the years that I was trying to figure out if this lifestyle is for me or not. So, yeah.\n What are some of your career highlights?\n One of the big things that I actually realised yesterday when I was reading another article was: in 2016, I got my FIDE trainer title. And even to this date, I am the youngest FIDE trainer in the world which is kind of cool, because that was like four years, almost four years ago. I received the titles of Woman Grand Master and International Master in 2016. 2016 was a big year. And I won so many [...] prizes in international tournaments. I played for different leagues, European Leagues, such as Switzerland, Belgium, Spain. And I am a part of the British League. I just don't really think it is safe to travel right now, otherwise I would be playing for tournaments. Ah, let's see, I did play in 2018 and I will be playing in US [Chess] Championship this year, but it has been postponed because of the [COVID-19] pandemic. But I am supposed to play in it when we know the dates, anyways. I think those are some of the ones that I run over just right now.\nHer games.\n What is your strategy while playing against players rated 2500+ points?\n It really depends on the colour and the preparation that I do. But I usually just try to play solid and wait for opponent's mistakes while trying to put my pieces in the best places possible. So that's something that I do regardless of who I'm playing. But the opening preparations might change depending on the opponent's rating.\n How has your strategy and game improved over the years?\n Well, my is really improved when I started to read 's books. And, those really helped. But I still have a long way to go to feel completely confident in my endgame skills.\n What is the opening you prefer?\n I really do like to play against . Just I've always had a pleasant position and I just have so much space and it really fits with my style. So yeah, I really like to play against French Defence.\n And which chess opening you really don't like?\n When I am black and they play something like against me because it is such a boring and without-any-soul position. I can't really get that creative and everything is just, well sitting and waiting, basically.\n Who is the toughest opponent you ever faced?\n It's kind of hard to say, let me keep thinking for a little. I played the Muzychuk sisters and in a tournament in late 2016. They were, I think they were one of the toughest ones.\n Do you prefer over-the-board games or ?\n A mix of both.\n Which do you prefer?\n Standard.\n How do you prepare for a tournament?\n It kind of depends. Because sometimes the tournament is really, the one thing I try to do is to match my time. So for example, US Championship is going to be held everyday at 1 pm sharp, so I try to do lot of trainings at 1 pm. Just because I want my brain to be prepared for that 1 pm chess-time instead of 1 pm nap-time. So I think that's one of the big things that I always try to do. If I have an important tournament and if I have the chance on the time to prepare for some of the physical and mental habits like this, I try to always do those. I also try to find a coach that I am comfortable with, and who has enough time for me, and just figure out my issues and try to fix them. Like if there is an opening issue, endgame issue, just something that I am missing about how to be better in chess.\nChess in general and other players.\n What do you think of the prevalence of ?\n They're good but I think it's kind of also disturbing to some extent because when you are analysing a line, you don't use your own brain as much anymore and you just rely on the computer's brain. Which is not necessarily a bad thing but it just kind of takes away the beauty of putting your brain to work.\n What do you think is the future of chess?\n It's kind of hard to say. I'm hoping that \u2014 I have a lot of different suggestions from different Grand Masters and Women Grand Masters about the fact that in FIDE's rules there is a difference between woman title and open titles and not everybody is a big fan of that. And we were having a discussion just in the kitchen at the Saint Louis Chess Club with the other Grand Masters about the pros and cons and they were saying that, as pros, some of the women in developing countries when they achieve the titles, that is like a really huge deal for them even though it is a woman title and it doesn't make sense to call something like a Woman Title and another Open Title. So there are a lot of controversies going around, so that as a pro that these women are being helped because they achieved the title. And another con is that, well, this doesn't feel right. It seems you are telling women that you are only good enough for women titles and that's \u2014 it's really wrong because it creates the ideas that men think better, men make better decisions, blah blah blah. I talked a lot in my TEDx talk last summer, that that's not true and this is just something that we have been told by society and by history. And that is something we should work to change but I hope that chess society will be able to come up with better ideas 'cause if I had an idea about what to do about chess society, I would find the right person to pitch it to, I just don't, right now. But I know there is a problem, I just don't have a solution for it.\n Which current players influence you the most?\n I am a big fan of both and because there are both really great chess players. And Fabiano Caruana, he does live in Saint Louis, so I know him more than I know Magnus Carlsen. And their personalities: like how different their personalities are and again, and at the same time, how they both are number 1 and 2 in chess and they're both the best players of this generation. That's something really interesting to me: not just their game, but how they think, and how they behave and, yeah. I tend to analyse people which gets me in trouble sometimes. [laughs]\n Who is your favourite opponent?\n My favourite opponent? My brother.\n How is he doing by the way?\n He is good. He helped me install an anti-virus on my laptop yesterday, so, kudos for that!\n He is in England right now, right?\n Yes.\nThe 2017 Gibraltar Chess tournament and getting banned from the Iranian National Chess team.\n Okay, tell me about the Gibraltar Chess Tournament.\n It was a really good tournament. I played very well. There was just one game where I could have played better. But I had very good results. I was drawing higher-rated Grand Masters and I was winning the lower-rated opponents, and I had a very nice tournament. It was a very high-class tournament and the organisers were super nice. And I was there with my mom and my brother, which made it even more nice. What else? I just really liked the atmosphere. I would like to go back and play again when I get some chance, but unfortunately, it's been during my exam every single year so far. But yeah, it went very smoothly. I played very well, I really liked it. It was just really great.\n Were you satisfied with your performance in the tournament?\n I feel like I could have done a little bit better, but yeah, overall I was, I played very well, and I really liked it.\n But it appears [as if] more happened in the media outside the tournament\n Oh yeah. Yeah, well, that's been kind of... interesting. Well, it wasn't right after that. It was, I played another tournament in Portugal right after, which I got sick during and I couldn't really play to my best. But I did get the best woman, anyways. Anyways, after that, I went for a vacation for about a week. And after that I went to play in tournaments in Austria right after. And that's when, I remember I didn't have Internet connection for a few hours because I was in a train ride from [...] I don't remember, a city in Germany to Austria. And during that time, during that hours I was offline, the whole hell broke lose. Well, yeah it did. And my phone started to blow up when I got Internet connection again. Just with followers and my friends messaging me where am I, if I were in Iran, if I am in Iran I should get out, and I was like, I am not in Iran, I haven't been back in Iran since I moved out in 2016 to live in Spain. But okay, I am not there and I start to follow news. And the next morning, my mom and my brother got to the hotel that we were staying at. And I explained to them what was going on and we were all extremely shocked. Because it's the timing of it, was extremely suspicious. Because the tournament [Gibraltar] happened weeks before and I was a resident of another country for more than six months. So the timing of it was extremely suspicious because the was happening in Iran at that time, and all of the Iranian female players who were playing in that tournament got eliminated and the Federation was under huge scrutiny from the Iranian government and the people. And they were like, \"Well, if you don't have good enough players to actually win this thing, why did you host it and why did you make us spend so much money on it?\" And because a lot of the best women chess players in the world refused to play in that tournament because of their values. And they didn't want to go to a country where they are required to have a certain dress code and they wanted to be comfortable when they were playing the tournament. So that was a whole big mess. And when the story about me broke out that I was not wearing a scarf and I was representing, whatever they were saying, all of the attention shifted to me and my brother instead of the Iranian Chess Federation mistakes in hosting the tournament.\n You weren't living in Iran at that time. You weren't representing Iran. You had made it very clear you didn't want to play for the federation. And yet they decide to sensationalise this banning of yours?\n Yep. That's why it was very idiotic and seemed more conspiracy rather than they actually were offended by my actions. Because they knew I weren't there. They knew I was living in another country and looking to change federations and I've told them that I won't be representing them in official tournaments any more and the whole thing was very idiotic. And more like a trying for a distraction rather than being actually offended. Because if they were actually offended, I would have probably understood that, I guess? But they weren't, because there was no reason to be offended. I wasn't in the country, I was a resident of another country and that was very interesting the way they dealt with it. And the fun fact is that if I was actually in Iran when the news broke, I would most likely still be in jail for I don't know what. So even if I was the resident of another country, citizen of another country, because the laws in Iran don't really follow much of human rights. Yeah, most likely I would still be rotting somewhere. Yeah.\n How did you cope with that?\n With the fact that I would never go back to the country I was from? I kind of expected that anyways, because I am against the government and everything it represents. I don't have enough power to speak up to more authorities and do much. So I just decided to leave the toxic environment. And to live in somewhere that I'm respected for my beliefs and my values rather than being told to shut up and just deal with [the world] as it is. So I didn't like living in Iran because of the Government anyways. So I was okay with my never going back when I moved out to go live in Spain. But, yeah, I still miss it. I still have dreams about my home and a lot of the places in Iran that I went to. But I accepted that I am never going back.\n How did you parents react to this?\n My mom is a huge planner. So she had planned for something to happen because she always likes to have a plan A, B, C, D, be like just continuous \u2014 she is a huge planner. And so she had somewhat prepared for the media scrutiny. And we decided not to give any interviews, because we didn't know at the time what was going to happen. My brother hasn't completed his immigration for his boarding school at that time. He was still working on it. And they probably realised that, all right, I was living in Spain anyways, so I would just live the life as I had. And staying focused on finalising my brother's immigration process. And we all decided to talk to one media at that [time]: . And I told that I am not ready to talk anything political, I want to be respectful and I want to just tell my side of the story. And they said they really liked that I agreed to just talk to someone. But after a few months, I was ready to talk about the political aspects of things. And I felt that I understood that more. So I wrote a piece for \"The New York Times\" and I talked to more media outlets about this whole thing.\n Did the Iranian chess players reach out to support you?\n Very very few. And that was something that I expected to be more. Because all of my high school friends, actually most of my high school, just the class that I had: they reached out and they have a group chat and they were really supportive, my high school friends. But from the chess players, I think, Iranian Chess players, very few, maybe not even five or ten reached out to show their support which was very shocking to me.\nThe Iranian government's hesitation of Iranian players playing against Israeli athletes.\n Your younger brother was also banned by the [Iranian] Chess Federation at the same tournament, playing against an Israeli Grand Master. He was fourteen. He was just a kid.\n Yeah. They keep making a big deal about playing against Israel. But the funny thing is that that tournament was in 2017 but in 2015, we both played against Israel in another tournament and nobody seemed to care, in the old tournament. I don't understand why they make it such a big deal. I understand that they don't recognise Israel as a country, which is super idiotic to me but anyways. And just because they don't recognise it, they want to pretend that it doesn't exist. So we are not supposed to play with it. Something like that. Which just doesn't make any logical sense.\n I just feel he shouldn't have been dragged into this [situation].\n Yeah. That's completely true. He shouldn't have. Because they just wanted a story and, well, the thing is that the first interviewer who talked to the [Iranian] Chess Federation's president, he questioned about my brother first. And then put me in as \"And her sister also doesn't wear a scarf\". But my story became more popular because it was something more relatable to the people outside of chess. Because just playing with Israel doesn't really make much sense why is a big deal to other, to foreign people rather than not being banned for not wearing scarf. But yeah, they made a big deal about him first, and then me, in Iran, in the interview that they had.\n Do organisers of the chess tournaments take measures not to pair Israeli players against Iranians?\n They used to, but, they stopped that since \u2014. Yeah, they used to, and they used to call it \"forbidden pairing\". But I think in about a year or two ago, when one of the Iranian chess players refused to play [against Israeli player] and when he went back to Iran, he became like a national hero. He didn't win the tournament. He didn't really \"do\" anything. He just refused to play against an opponent which is very wrong in any sportsmanship manner, but anyways. He became a national hero. He scored a lot of financial and media attention. He met with like the Iranian Government. Yeah, it was like, just because he didn't play, he gained so much from it. And so that's something that the FIDE refused to play by anymore and they, FIDE, made this rule that, yup, you can't play, we are not going to help you with your not playing against the opponent and then going back to your country and scoring all this financial, and attention.\n In 2016, in a Swiss Chess tournament at Basel, Iranian Grand Master refused to play against an [Israeli] player. Do you remember that?\n Yeah, I was there. I was playing the same tournament. From what I remember, he faked showing up late. He showed up few minutes after the time control has already made the opponent win by time and pretended he was late for whatever reason and, blah-blah. They tend to fake illnesses and get some doctor notes. And that's what they did, some of the boys did in World Junior Championship. And, yeah, it's an ugly situation. Because for the players, it's a lose-lose. If you don't play, you won't be respected as a chess player in the chess society. But if you do play, you'd be under huge scrutiny from the country; the government. So it's a lose-lose. And that's, from what I understood that was one of the deal breakers for and that's why one of the reasons that he immigrated and stopped representing Iran as well.\n I must say, on he [Alireza Firouzja] has been terrific.\n Yeah! I have seen him playing a lot of online tournaments and and he's very cool, I'm very glad for the kid.\nMore about her life in the US.\n Does your family still live in Tehran?\n My family, yeah. They still do.\n What are the things you miss the most about living in Tehran?\n The food. I really really really like Persian food and it is kind of really hard to find it here. And I miss my mother's home-cooked meals rather than restaurants. And she can't just ship me food. It would be awesome if she could. [laughs] Um, what else? I really like spending time with family and friends. Which, right now, everything is just online. So. I still do have some connections. But.\n Why did you choose to leave Spain, and what would you have done if you hadn't received the scholarship?\n Well, I really knew that I would continue in education, 'cause I didn't want to play chess and \"not\" go to university. I wanted to have an option. But I didn't want to play chess because I didn't have options. That is a big thing for me: I wanted to have gone to college and have a degree and see if I want to pursue a career out of chess or to choose chess. So I wanted to have that choice. So I was looking into going to universities in US anyways, and before I did my SATs, I talked to two different universities: Saint Louis University [SLU] and [University of Texas at Tyler]. And they both offered very great scholarships. And the one factor that I, kind of like made my decision was the summer housing. Because I wouldn't have anywhere to go and live. I don't have the luxury of going back to my family for a summer. And I just hated the idea of every summer having to find a friend and just like being living with someone for three months. So SLU offered to cover the summer housing and I would be on campus dorms \u2014 apartments \u2014 and that was the big decisive factor for me.\n Did the Iranian Government cause any trouble when you accepted the scholarship or decided to play for the US Chess Federation?\n No. No; well, they didn't really have a say in this switching the federation part, specially because I talked to FIDE. I emailed FIDE and I informed that I would like to switch federations without Iranian being involved because they already disrespected me enough and I don't want to have to face them and FIDE agreed. And I simply switched federations first to FIDE, and then from FIDE to US.\n Previously you had mentioned, \"no federation is perfect\". Is there anything that Iranian Chess Federation gets right?\n Well, I think you are referring to the interview, that video interview that I had in Baku. Well, I wasn't ready to talk realistically about the Iranian Federation and I didn't want to be disrespectful because at the time, they hadn't disrespected me. And I wanted to keep decent relations with them. And that's why I said \"no federation is perfect\". I was hoping that someone would read between the lines and see that I am not happy with the federation.\n How was the federation in treating their athletes?\n Well, not very good. Most of the student athletes didn't really have financial support or coaches. So it was just like you were basically on your own. And there was some help to send people to tournaments but it was no where nearly enough to see who has what potential.\n Should elementary schools teach and encourage students to play chess?\n Yes, definitely.\n And what are some of the advantages in doing that?\n One of the biggest things is that you learn to plan. You learn to strategise. You learn to think ahead. And I think that those are some of the basic things you learn from chess. If you want to win at any game in chess, you need to be able to have confidence to actually your opponent. You need to have time management. And you need to be able to strategise and plan ahead, see what you opponent want to do.\n What are some of the chess strategies you have applied in your real life?\n Oh, this one I did say in my TEDx talk; I'm gonna use that. I strategically manuevered and removed myself from the toxic environment of the Iranian Chess Federation and I moved to Spain and then US. That was good strategic maneuvering.\n What is the one thing, other than chess, that you are an expert in?\n My cat. I am very good with animals.\n What are the key things you learned living in Iran?\n I learned to fight for what I want. I learned that nothing actually comes easy. You have to work for it. And I learned that even though a lot of thing seem like basic human rights and logic, that's not how everybody sees it. And those are some of the things I have been struggling to deal with here in college, because for most people: they are Americans, and their families are here. And probably the most horrific thing that's happened to them was maybe they had to put a dog down. Which is sad. I understand. But still, you can't compare that to not seeing your family for years, and not being able to go back to your country. I feel like I'm like a hundred years older than the kids my age here.\n How has the atmosphere changed since moving to the United States?\n I have learned, that it is okay to be myself. I don't have to fake it to please people. I hate being a people-pleaser. I am still trying to adjust to how people see the world, because not everybody is always analysing and calculating things the way I am, because that's how I grew up. And that's how I grew up doing chess. And that's something I am still adjusting because sometimes it can be too much for my friends. [laughs] That I am always trying to see moves ahead of what they're going to do, what's going happen in their lives. And, yeah, I can understand how that might not be a pleasant thing for my friends. Because nobody like a smart-ass, so.\n How is life at the Saint Louis University?\n I have a lot of great friends. I really enjoy studying with them. I really enjoy just meeting up with them. And, I really like it here.\n How do you train these days?\n Well, everything is online. So we have been training and playing a lot of online games.\n Tell us about your team at the Saint Louis Chess Club.\n Well, the chess club is slightly different than Saint Louis University's chess team. Because the club and the team do collaborate, but the team is slightly different than the club. [...] For the first time last year, we had an all-girls team. And that was very empowering to me.\n Who coaches you there?\n Alejandro Ram\u00edrez.\n Well, how is it to have Alejandro Ram\u00edrez as your coach? How is he in person?\n He is very friendly. I was friends with him before I came to this college. The year we played a tournament in Denmark, 2014. And he was always a very nice person and always looking out for his friends. And yeah, he was always very nice to everybody.\n How do your fellow teammates describe you as a person and as a player?\n Everybody is quite respectful, but the ideas of gender-inequality do exist. Mainly because they are not informed enough about the biology and how human biology actually works. So I did receive questions about my TED talk and to me it seemed like they simply wanted to understand the topic more than criticise it. So they had questions like \"But by statistics, men drive better, men are better in maths, men are better in chess\". And I was like, so you are saying that men think better and make better decisions basically. And, they were like \"I don't know enough about it, but it seems that way\". And I was like, well, answer this question: If you are dying, if you are bleeding out and they take you to an emergency room and your doctor is a female, would you be like \"No no, I want a male doctor. Female brain doesn't work as well.\" Well, you don't say that. You are glad that the woman is there to fix you. So if you can trust your life with a woman, why can't you trust a woman do think as good. [...] It is not about the gender who thinks better. It is about each individual. And they were very respectful to these topics.\n You had applied for the US citizenship. Has it been approved?\n Yeah! I got my green card last year.\n What is your major at the Saint Louis University?\n I am double majoring in biology and clinical health sciences.\n How do you manage to train and participate in chess tournaments with ongoing academic curriculum?\n Well I haven't been able to participate in as many tournaments as I would want, because I have so many exams and different classes. But I play as much as I can and the teachers are very cooperative. Because they understand that I am a professional chess player and I need to, I kind of \"have\" to play. It's like if I don't play then it's \u2014 well some of the team tournaments that we play also are university sponsored. Well, most of the tournaments we play are university sponsored, so the teachers do their best to cooperate with that as well.\n What is the biggest decision you have made since moving to the US?\n Biggest decision. Wanting to be a surgeon.\nThe chess federations she was associated with.\n Have you participated in the ? And are you looking forward to participating in them?\n I am looking forward to participating in them; I haven't represented any country because I didn't want to represent Iran, previously, and I did tell you that I was there working as press in 2016, . But I refused to participate for Iranian Federation. But I hope that some day I will be able to represent US in Olympiads.\n Are there any advantages of playing for any federation?\n No.\n Apart from the Olympiads, I guess.\n Well, here I have better stability and it's more welcoming than Iran would ever be.\n Did the Iranian Chess Federation ever support you, back in the days?\n Yes. They did send me to different tournaments. And they did provide me with some coaching in 2012\u201313.\n How is the US Chess Federation different in that aspect?\n Well, right now, I am more supported by the University and the Chess Club rather than the Federation as a whole. But the US Federation has been always supportive of my decisions to speak up.\n How can the problems at Iranian Chess Federation be improved?\n I don't think they can until [\"while\"] the government is the same, or, shares the same values and is unwilling to do the basic human rights.\n Tell me about the time you got the title \"International Master\". And which title: Female Grand Master or International Master gave you more joy?\n So, I have received all of the female titles. I started from Women Candidate Master, Women FIDE Master, Women International Master, Women Grand Master, and ultimately men International Master. It was approved in Baku, the same 2016 Olympiad. And it was very pleasant. I expected it to be approved anyways, because that's just their normal routine. But it was very nice because at that time, as soon as it got approved, as soon as I officially hold the titles, my family were in Baku at the same time. So we went out, and we had a nice celebration.\nBridging the gender gap, especially in chess and the society.\n You had previously mentioned in your TED talk, you are curious about the human brain, and would like to study more about it. How is that going to affect your chess career?\n Yep, that's true. Well, I feel like the more information I have about how anything works, it helps me become a better human being. And more mature, and I have seen the way I think about chess has changed compared to when I was, let's say eighteen, just because I am more mature right now and I am more honest to myself. It's easier for me to see certain moves and certain patterns whereas when I was a teenager. So I hope the more information I get anywhere helps me become a better human and better chess player.\n Are the gendered titles and segregated events bad in the long run?\n I think so, yeah. But at the same time, that is not a problem they can fix immediately, because if they take away all of the women titles, so many women will be harmed by that. Because they are receiving benefits from their governments and from the chess federations.\n Earlier this year, an [Iranian] Female Grand Master in a tournament in Moscow: she chose not to wear [a] hijab. Iranian Chess Federation President announced she was now banned from the Iranian Chess Team. Iranian chess arbiter Shohreh Bayat decided not to return to the country after a photo of hers was circulated by the Iranian press in which her headscarf was not visible. What do you think of this situation?\n I mean, I am glad that they're finding their voice. But they were not supportive when I found my voice.\n What was the President of the Iranian Chess Federation Mehrdad Pahlavanzadeh like?\n At the time I thought he was nice and genuine, but the more I got to know him, it felt like he was very power-hungry and a lot \u2014 really fake. I just don't really have better words to put.\n Why does the federation take these actions instead of looking at the player's performance?\n Well, the other problem is that they are under big scrutiny from the government because the government expects the women to behave a certain way and to dress a certain way. So it's not just about what the federation thinks. It's also a lot on the government.\n What message would you like to give to Iranian chess players?\n Be true to yourself. If this isn't the right fit for you, find the right fit. And if you do believe and you are happy where you are, nobody should be able to tell you not to be happy and to disrespect your beliefs.\n Back in 2017, the was held in Riyadh [in Saudi Arabia\u200d] and Israeli chess players were denied visa. Iran hosted the and it was boycotted by [WGM] due to the mandatory hijab. What is your say in organising events in these countries where players are either forced to adhere to a dress code, or denied visa altogether because of their nationality?\n That's very wrong to give tournament organisation to these countries. They shouldn't do that. Because these countries aren't following the basic human rights. And we shouldn't support and encourage them to just keep treating women as they are, and giving them organisation, giving them publicity will just encourage that [what] they are doing is right which they aren't.\n Back in 2017, even [GM] tweeted, \"To organise a chess tournament in a country where basic human rights aren't valued is horrible. Chess is a game where all different sorts of people can come together, not a game in which people are divided because of their religion or country of origin.\"\n Yes, I completely agree with that.\nHer life.\n Well, what are you favourite places to play chess?\n Switzerland.\n What are you favourite chess books?\n I really like the Mark Dvoretsky books. I also really like the five books by Kasparov, '. Another book that I really like is '. A lot of people don't like it, and I probably wouldn't like it right now, but it was a huge deal for me when I first read it. The way that they explain it and the way they inspired me to think was different than what I was doing. So I learned a lot from it.\n What are your favourite non-chess books?\n Non-chess books. Um, I really like to read books by [], and he's a doctor here in the US who writes different books and explains how he felt on his experience, on his intake. So I really like that.\n Who helped you get where you are today?\n My parents.\n What important truths do a very few people agree with?\n I think one of the things that's kind of, people are still trying to learn is respecting everybody's beliefs. Because people can be extremely judgemental. \"I\" can be judgemental sometimes, and I have to talk myself and explain to myself that, okay \u2014 people are allowed to do what they want and it is not my place to judge everybody. And sometimes we all need that reminder.\n What do you do to relax when you are not playing chess?\n I really like to watch TV shows, about different careers, 'cause I am never going to be a lawyer but just watching a law-related TV show helps me understand that aspects too.\n What according to you makes chess beautiful?\n Sometimes it feels like chess is like you are hearing the music that the pieces are making and you're dancing, the pieces are dancing, to it. And then you figure out a \"beautiful\" tactic. I really like that analogy.\n What motivates you to play chess?\n Well, I'd like to show people that you can do different things with your life. And the idea that you can play chess and still study and still have a life outside of chess. I think that's one of the big things for me.\n How much time do you spend behind analysing your own games?\n Quite a lot actually. It kind of depends on the game and ideally if I have the time, I would like to go back and talk to my brother or another chess friend. And get their inputs.\n What advice do you have for new chess players?\n To figure out what they want and to find a book and find a coach who cares about them. Well the book shouldn't care about the person, but the book should be able to speak to the person, because sometimes you just look at the books and look at the positions just because of the positions. But sometimes when you are reading the book, you are actually feel that you understand this, and it is more than just a book to you.\n What are some of the bad traits that hold a player down?\n Feeling like you are not good enough. And feeling like your opponent is better than you, or, lot of these feelings that you are not good enough, you can't do it. Because if you have any of these thoughts going into a chess game, you are not gonna come out it very happy.\n What is the best advice given to you?\n My mom, she always encouraged me to be true to be myself and to find the best way of expressing myself. Because I went through a period when I was extremely straightforward with everybody and it was kind of hurtful. Because I just didn't want to pretend anything. I didn't want to fake anything. And then my mom helps me realise that it is not about being straightforward or faking it. It is actually finding the right words to put in, because sometimes what you say is hurtful but what you mean is not. So that smooth transition between matching what you say and what you mean, I think that was one of the biggest advice I've got.\n In future what do you want to achieve in the game of chess?\n I would really like to be in US top five. And I would also really like to be involved in chess as much as I can. I do have my FIDE trainer title, and I would really like to be able to teach more kids. I do have a few students and it seems to be going good, so far. But I would like to understand better how to fix and help the players.\n Those were all the questions I had for you. Is there something you would like to add?\n Um, no I am good. Thank you."}

The survey was reportedly to be published in \"\".\nLead author Daniel Paluh, a Ph.D. candidate at the , said, \"Superficially, frogs may look similar, but when you look at their skulls, you see drastic differences [...] Some of the weirdest skulls are found in frogs that eat birds and mammals, use their heads as a shield, or in a few rare cases, are venomous. Their skulls show how strange and diverse frogs can be.\"\nSome scientists had previously suggested smaller frogs would tend to develop spiky skulls, but that is not what this study reports. Here, researchers evaluated on 158 different species. They found frogs that had similar ecological niches \u2014 meaning they either acquired food in the same way or defended themselves from predators in the same way \u2014 tended to develop skulls with similar grooves, spikes, or specialized jaw joints .\nAccording to the study, skulls with spikes, grooves or ridges \u2014 called \" \u2014 often accompanied frogs eating very large prey relative to their own body size. The strong, spacious skulls would allow the frogs to have very big mouths with which to catch birds, rodents, reptiles and other frogs. Spikes sometimes coincided with venomous frogs. The researchers speculated the spikes make it dangerous for predators to hit the frog's head, as the spikes would break venom sacs under the frog's skin.\nOther bone formations included projections resembling fangs or lower teeth that different species of frogs use for catching prey and fighting. Very few frogs have true lower teeth.\nOne of the study's authors, herpetologist David Blackburn, told \" the frequency of spiky skulls evolving in otherwise unrelated frogs suggested some deep pattern frogs fell into as circumstances arose: \"Somehow, these frogs are turning on some ancient developmental machinery in their .\"\nSince 1973, when frogs skulls were last comprehensively surveyed, scientists have documented enough new species to double the number known to humans. Also, modern techniques exploit CT scans, of which Paluh and his team made liberal use. The research was part of the oVert project, funded by the National Science Foundation, meant to comprehensively CT-scan over 20,000 vertebrate specimens from United States museums. "}

The rats were trained to develop a preference for one of the two levers: each delivering one pellet of . One of the two levers was harder to press.\nAfter developing a preference, the preferred lever was wired to deliver a shock to another rat in a neighbouring compartment, while delivering a single pellet of sucrose. The study showed the actor rat, which pressed the lever tend to switch the lever to avoid shocking the other rat. The rat receiving the shock was called a victim rat.\nAversion of harm to fellow rats was reported to be equal in both male and female rats. If the actor rats were previously exposed to the shocks, their degree of harm aversion for others was heightened, the study revealed.\nThe investigation reported the rats avoided pressing the preferred lever to shock another rat, even if that lever delivered two sucrose pellets and the no-harm lever delivered only one. However, this was not the case when the rats were given three pellets by the shock lever. Most of the actor rats did not switch when they received three pellets pressing the lever, which also delivered an electric shock. Dr Gazzola called it a \"tipping point\" and said it was a \"cost-benefit\" function.\nThe study also revealed the importance of the (ACC) region of the rat's brain for harm aversion. The scientists tested harm aversion for conspecifics in the after deactivating the ACC using . Muscimol was injected in the rats belonging to the test group, while saline water was injected to rats in the control group. The observations showed without the active ACC due to muscimol, the active rats in the test group were no longer averse to harming the victim rats, but degree of harm aversion did not drop in the control group rats.\nInterview with Dr Keysers and Dr Gazzola.\n Thank you for agreeing for this discussion, by the way.\n Um, hmm. Our pleasure.\n So, I would like to discuss about the study, the observations you've made and what lies ahead to be discovered in this field.\n So, what prompted you, and your interest in studying about this harm aversion?\n So half of the lab works on . And half on , right? So, the main topic of the lab is really to try to discover the brain mechanism that allow us to be , basically. That's the main theme. So in particular, from the human research what we are interested is really trying to see whether embodiment: so these processes that these brain regions have become reactivated when we see somebody else in pain, for instance. You know, the regions normally involve[d] in [making] pain also reactivated when you observe somebody else [in pain]. Whether these, the activity of these regions is essential to motivate us for instance not to hurt other people.\n And one of the biggest limitation[s] in particular of the human research is that you can go so far in understanding the brain mechanism. Because we cannot, we don't have tools with the correct in terms of, for instance, understanding what a single cell does, in these processes. And that's why, for many years, we developed, we tried to develop a model in animals where all these techniques are more available that would allow us to investigate similar processes to those in humans. So processes basically that are involved in perceiving the other['s] distress also in animals. And, that's basically the main reasons why we move towards this research and then we started from coming up with the experiment in which we simply measure the distress of an animal in reaction to the distress of another. Which what we call , for instance. And we made it more and more complex in order to reach slowly a degree of complexity that can be comparable to processes in humans. Emotional contagions: you can compare it, for instance, that the level of humans when you are in a crowd, or when you are baby, that as a crowd you are contaged by the emotions are around. And, but then, we wanted to go a little bit of a step forward: okay now I am contaged, what does it mean to be contaged? Can I use this information to, for instance, avoid hurting other people. And that's how we came about, more or less, so.\n I mean, one other motivation we have is that in the past we've also been interested in people that seemed to lack the aversion to harming others. I mean, with that , sometimes they're called as well. And so, a couple of years ago, we made this study in which we identified psychopathic criminals in high-security institutions. We brought them to the lab, and we scanned their brains while they witnessed the pain of other individuals. And what we saw was that if they don't have any particular reason to empathise with others, they really have reduced activity in their own pain regions while they witness the pain of others. So, of course, that's interesting and it may suggest that perhaps, the reason why if they can make some money, for instance, they don't mind to harm other people is because they don't activate their own pain much while they witness the pain of others. The problem like Valeria was saying, is that in humans we can see that the brain region is active while you see the pain of others, but you can't easily change the activity in the brain region to see whether that would change the way that the psychopathic criminal would act. I mean, ideally, what we'd like to do is increase the activity of these pain regions in psychopaths and see that now suddenly they would really care to not harm others anymore.\n Although it's not yet, it's also not yet very clear that we need activity of these regions to avoid the harm, right? At that point, that's how we came about to run the experiment, because the first question was: is it really necessary. The activity of these regions. So, you start with okay, you want to manipulate these regions to reduce psychopathy. But the field could not even prove that this activity was necessary to reduce harm.\n And so, that was really one of the strong motivation behind the -experiment, because rats have a very similar to what humans have. It is really a core part of the brain that is involved in feeling your own pain. So, if you don't have a cingulate cortex and you hurt yourself, you still feel that you've cut yourself, but you don't mind. And so you are not going to do a lot to avoid being cut again. So this region exists also in the rats and it is a relatively deep brain region. So therefore, we turn to the rats, and figure that in the rat, we can change the activity in the brain region and see whether that would then change how much the rat would be aversed to harming other rats or not.\n Could you briefly explain this study and its findings?\n Ah. So very briefly, what we do is we give a rat a choice between two that the rat can press. Both of these levers will provide the rat with one little pellet of sugar which they really like. So, they are happy to press these levers to get the reward. In the main experiment, what we do is that one of the two levers is a little bit more difficult to press than the other one. So most of the rats start to prefer the easy lever to press.\nNow, as soon as they have developed the preference for the easy lever, what we do is that now, still both levers give one pellet of sucrose. But now the preferred, the easy lever, also gives a shock to a rat that's in the compartment next door. And so then, the rat that presses the lever not suddenly hears someone next door, kind of, in the protesting with the pain-squeak about the shock that he just got. And what we see is that the, about a little bit less than half of the rats will now stop to use their preferred lever because it gives a shock to the other one, and they would start to press the harder lever to avoid to shock to the other rat.\nNow after we found that, we could do is go to the cingulate cortex, which is the region that we saw was less active in the psychopathic criminal, and is normally active when you feel the pain of other people. And what we saw was that when we deactivate this region with muscimol, which is a bit like a local anesthetic, which you can inject the part of the brain, now suddenly, the rats that continued to use their favourite lever even when it harms another rat. So now, what we see in there mainly are kind of two big findings. One is it shows us that humans are not the only animals that don't like to harm other animals. Rat also do that. And second is the fact that they use the same brain region, which is the cingulate cortex that humans use while they witness the pain of other people, as a necessary part of this harm aversion.\nAnd the fact that it's the same brain region that we see to be active in humans tells us that in a way, it's not just the case that rats and humans have independently developed harm aversion. It suggests that there is kind of a common ancestor that already had this ability, and that was then given to both the rats and the humans. Which means that kind of harm aversion and not wanting to harm other people is at least 100 million years old, because that's more-or-less when our separated from rodents like rats and .\n And that also what we see is that there is variability in the responses of the observers, of the rats that make the choice between the levers. And these variabilities also present in humans: when you do tasks that are rather similar, you see that not everyone acts socially, preferring the social lever. But you also have individuals that would go for the reward more often. So this is also another similarity between the animal world and the human world. And on top of that, I think that the other things we've learned from that experiment is that, the decision is a function, basically. Because, we have a condition for instance where we increase the reward for the animal, for the observer. And when you increase the reward, they are less willing to switch to the other lever. So that also another similarity with human world and shows that maybe that it is a bit of complex, a tipping point, and it is like a function that really weighs the cost and the benefit of that particular context.\n Because when Valeria says that we increase the reward, we increase the difference between the two levers. So in the main experiment, the only difference is that one is harder to press than the other, but they both give one pellet. Then in two other experiments, what we did was that now that two levers are equally hard to press; but one of them gives you two pellets, the other one just one pellet. And then rats are still willing to switch away from the two-pellet to the one-pellet to save the other one from pain. But when we made it three pellets versus one pellet, then, none of the rats were willing to give up the three pellets to prevent the shock to the other person.\n Yeah, and then, the last, I think, result I kind of like in a way is that, as in many human studies, also in the animal world we did not find significant difference between . So both, the female and the males acts in a similar way. And in this type of , is also often the case in humans.\n That's true.\n So that's also interesting.\n What is the most fascinating aspect of this finding?\n Well, in a way, I would say, to really show \u2014 I mean, I always believed it that animal performed these choices too. And that they do it to a certain extent to at least care or at least perceive what goes on in the other, right. It can't maybe specifically speaking of voluntarily care about others, but at least they perceive what goes on and I think this is something that the study shows pretty well that they do perceive, and that based on these perception[s], they make a decision. And I think it is a complex \u2014 I mean, to me it was in a way trivial, because I always believed that, you know, if you are a \"\", whether you are a rat, or a person, we are still animals, right? They must develop behaviours that take advantage, or that they adapt to the fact that it's a social environment that involves more individuals. But [...] the field keeps discussing, right? Whether animals also have emotions, whether animals also can take this sort of decision. And to see, slowly that evidence accumulates in favour of processes similar to what we call or . You know, similar: not exactly the same, but similar processes also are present in animals, to me is sort of reassuring also. And I think it allows us to learn from how evolution evolved as well. Maybe apart from knowing exactly how it works, but we start having some models where we can think, oh, evolutionary: maybe this process was already there, and then it developed further, more complex for the humans, but still is there to a certain extent.\n Yeah, and I think the fact that it's really the same brain region as well that seems to be involved kind of gives us some confidence that prosociality in caring about others is really deeply ingrained in our biology.\n What technologies were used to conduct this study?\n Yeah so in many ways it's a relatively simple study. So we didn't need to use anything very high-tech in this case. Because to alter brain activity, we use the injection of muscimol, which is a GABAA blocker. It is a very simple pharmacological agent. So it's really technologically a very simple study. Nothing fancy.\n How did you get involved in this study?\n Oh, we brainstormed about it. We started, as I said, we did a lot of research on, since our early ages, let's say in all our scientific career is based on embodiment, and activities in these areas and slowly we kept wondering more and more, on the role of these areas. And then, the way it goes, we normally speak about a topic and include other people and keep brainstorming, and I think, that's how it goes. At least for us. And in humans, we are also developing similar paradigms, so it just came one plus one equal to two. [laughs]\n What were the roles of other people involved in this study?\n So, Julen Hernandez-Lallement, the first author of the study, was the one that basically made the vast majority of the experiments. And he was helped by the other two: [Augustine Triumph] Attah: who did part of the other animal groups, and then Cindy [Pinhal] and Efe [Soyman] helped to analyse the data. And basically Valeria and me have been kind of help designed this study initially and helped to analyse the data and wind up the study. So we kind of lead the lab, but it's the other people that really manipulate the rats and do all the hard work.\n What was the timeline of this study?\n Well, it was long.\n Yeah, I would say, four years?\n (Wow!)\n Yeah, because the behavioural part is the longest one. Because you need to understand the best way to teach the animal, first to manipulate the lever, then to manipulate two levers, and then, before the lever, there is also another action that they need to do; and everything needs to be done within a certain time. So you need to let the animal the time to learn and for you that you run the experiment, you need to learn what's the best way, what's the best way to teach them to do the task?\nYeah, behavioural experiments of animals: they normally take quite some time to develop, specially more complex ones.\n Which activity took the most time \"and\" attention?\n Yeah, I think that Valeria just said what's really important in these studies is to understand what kind of situation you can create for the rats that they are really understand and which they can in a way, show you what they're capable of. So, kind of fine-tuning all the elements of the task, kind of how long do you let the rats develop the preference for one lever. Because if you give them too much time to get too used to one lever, they are not so willing to switch anymore. So the, most of the time is really involved in trying different versions of the paradigm, understanding what the rats really understand, and then analysing all the behaviour.\n What were the conditions did you test the hypothesis on?\n Yeah exactly; so the three kind of conditions we looked at was the hard vs the easy lever, and then seeing whether they switch to the harder lever when, to prevent the shock to the other one. And we tried the two pellets versus one pellet and, then the three pellets versus one pellet. And then finally, to test really whether the cingulate is necessary for that, we compare the condition in which we inhibit the activity in the cingulate using muscimol against the condition where we just inject salt water into the same brain region which doesn't have any effect.\n So, you mentioned the study took four years. So you started back in 2016?\n Correct. Yeah.\n Yeah, more or less. I don't know the date.\n What was the most difficult part of this study in these four years?\n I think it was really again the establishing the behaviour. And in particular because we, at first \u2014 so the paradigm itself, we took it from a previous study, that was run years ago, do you remember?\n Yeah, in '69, so that's kind of 50 years ago.\n Fifty years years ago, so the idea of the two levers. And so and at that time, the articles' level of detail were not so many. The articles were not giving as much information as we now have to write down. And so we had to guess some parameters over there. And, the fact that the rats would prefer the easy lever was also not so straightforward. So we thought \"oh, they are gonna prefer the easy lever, and that's it.\" But at the end, you know, some rats, some animals develop a preference on the side; like they prefer their right lever, or the left lever, or others, they prefer the heavy lever. Right? And that was also a bit puzzling at first. We said, okay, so what do we do? We find that a couple of rats prefer the hard lever, is that meaningful or not? So we have to discuss a lot, how to adapt the paradigm to make it work, and this is also why we came about in using this switching index, because for our purposes, at the end, as long as the rat is able to switch a preference, right, whatever preference is developed is irrelevant, right? And before the beginning of this study, we were more thinking: oh, they have to develop the preference for the easy lever. And that's what is bringing us a bit out of the main purpose. And we realised: okay, but, what preference they develop at the end, it doesn't matter as long as we have a preference that we can show they can change because of the shock. So, I think this was one of the longest part[s], I would say.\n Were you anticipating this outcome?\n Yes.\n Yeah, I would say yes.\n For once.\n [laughs] Yeah, for once, yeah. I mean, there was some evidence around and previous work was already bringing us towards that direction. And, yeah, I mean we could not anticipate the proportion of animals that they would switch. But, we surely were expecting the rats to switch.\n We were hoping for the cingulate to be necessary, so.\n So what was your first reaction after confirming the hypothesis was true?\n We were happy.\n Yeah.\n How many rats were used, roughly speaking, for this study?\n I think it's written in the paper, but my guess would be something like, I'd say, 70.\n How distantly were the rats related to each other?\n Yeah, so that's interesting, in this study we really find that there is a lot of variability between the rats. So like I was mentioning, we have about 40% that were ready to switch when they witnessed other one getting shocked. And about 60% that do not switch, so as a group, we really see that they do switch. But then only a proportion of individuals really show that sensitivity, and others do not.\n Or did you mean how close they were in terms of familiarity?\n I meant in . How genetically close they were?\n So they're not genetically related. They're not brothers or sisters. And what we have is we have, we made one of the experiments with rats that didn't meet each other before, and it [the experiment] works. And we had other cases in which they were living in the same home cage, and so they [would know] each other very well. And the effect was not stronger. So, amongst our rats, we really noticed that they care even about the fate of a stranger.\n So, if it fair to say there was no change in the degree of harm aversion when the actor and the victim were mates?\n Correct. Well, mates as in cage mates. Yeah, there was no sign of a difference. We did look at it and it was not the perfect comparison because the two groups were slightly different in the paradigm as well. But, it didn't look like there was a big difference.\n So, do you think the degree of harm aversion would have been greater if the actor-victim shared some sort of kinship?\n So we're actually going to test that very soon. And it is up for grabs. But in the past we've looked at whether a rat shows more freezing when it sees another one get a shock. Which is a form of emotional contagion. And there we compare a kind of rats from different strain,s even. So one of the albino rats against a rat, versus, that had never seen each other before, or ever seen a member of that strain, the one end. And on the other end, really the rats have spent five weeks together and knew each other very well. And we didn't see any difference there. So I think the most robust findings is really that they care even about what happens to a stranger.\n Yeah, we are testing it again now, in the future.\n Exactly, specifically whether a mother would do more for her own kids than for...\n Kids of somebody else.\n Yeah.\n Well, that would go on to support Richard Dawkins' '.\n Correct. Right.\n Yeah.\n How was the functioning of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) deactivated in the rats?\n Yeah, what you do is you place a . So you put the animal in a stereotact which is a system where you can go to a very specific position in the brain. We place a cannula, which is like an injection needle just where we know the cingulate to be. Then you let the animal recover with the cannula cemented in place. Then, on the day of the experiment, you basically inject a little bit of muscimol, which is an agent that blocks . Then by doing that, you can reduce the activity of the cingulate for about one hour. And during that hour, you can make the experiment. And then the control group is the same thing, but instead of injecting the muscimol, you inject some salt water.\n What are the affects of muscimol on the rat's body other than deactivating the cingulate?\n Nothing really. Because you inject a very small quantity, that should only spread about 1\u00a0mm in the brain. So it really just affects the region that you \u2014 and you don't see any change in behaviour. So we also tested, for instance, whether they move more or less, whether they press the levers quicker or slower, and there was no difference. The only difference is that they didn't learn to not press the one [lever] that shocks the other.\n And for instance, when you inject with muscimol, in case you see doing a normal paradigm. So whether you are still shocked to the sound, and then you present the sound. In that case, the rat behaves normally. And it still freezes. So, it does suggest that the muscimol effect is not impairing the normal behaviour, but specifically impairs the social behaviour of feeling...\n ...of feeling for others.\n Exactly. That was also the interesting part of the ACC that we believe to contribute really, to including the other [animal] into your decision-making. Because for a normal fear conditioning paradigm, you don't need to go through the ACC. They are made to be self-sufficient. But, if you do a fear conditioning basically that involves another individual instead of sound, like of pain, then you do need to go to the contribution of the ACC. So there seems to be two slightly complementary pathway for fear-detection.\n After the effect of deactivating the ACC wore off, was the degree of harm aversion of the actors back to the previously observed level?\n Yeah, that we didn't measure. So, in that study, the muscimol animals were only in the behaviour with the ACC deactivated and the other ones were only with their ACC intact. So, but this is something that we plan to test in the future as well. To really see whether the ACC is necessary to acquire the aversion versus to maintain it.\n Okay. So it is not a permanent loss of empathy. Right?\n We don't know, but I think there is no reason to assume that when the muscimol wears off, they would not become normal again, right? So that's most likely. What we don't know is whether if we had for instance, because there's three days of experiment, right, where we develop the aversion. And what we didn't try is for instance, give muscimol on Day 1 and Day 2 and then stop it on Day 3, and see whether on Day 3, they would then suddenly stop using the lever that gives shocks on the other days. So that we don't know whether it's necessary for learning or for recall; we just know that if you don't have it at all, you don't learn at all.\n Did any of the actor rats choose to switch when they were on muscimol, and their ACC was deactivated? Did any one of them switch?\n It's a good question. I would need to look in the paper. If you have the paper there, perhaps you can see it. But I can have a quick look to see if I have the paper somewhere. Yeah, so if you look at the Figure 4c, you can see the behaviour of each individual animal. And what you will notice is that there are some animals like some of the red animals which are the muscimol group that did switch, but the majority didn't switch. So I see there is one and only one animal in the muscimol group that really did switch. But what happens is that when you make those experiments, you never know for sure that when you inject the muscimol, that it has the desired effect. Because of course you have a cannula that's in the brain, and the cannula could become clogged also. So it can be that that one animal switched because the muscimol wasn't effective for some reason.\n Did the team test the change in the degree of harm aversion when the actor rats were given psychoactive drugs?\n No.\n No. Could be nice, but we didn't.\n Exactly. Yeah, and in particular, there is a drug called Ecstacy that you may have heard of. So, some people reported that Ecstasy for instance, increases the feeling of empathy amongst humans. And I think that there is somewhere a study suggesting that if you give that to animal, there is also an increase in the sensitivity to what happens in another animal. So we didn't test that.\n Did you also conduct the test with only one lever delivering the food also the electric shocks: how far the rats were willing to starve before they chose the victim should suffer?\n Yeah, no so we didn't do that. That is a very old experiment from . I think in the 50s, he did that experiment kind of with rats and with monkeys. And he sees that the rats will use the lever less. So even if you just have one lever, they'll use it less if it causes pain to others. But in monkeys, that was a very strong affect. Some of the monkeys really would rather not eat anything than to shock another monkey. So it's an interesting experiment, but we haven't done it.\n In that diagram, we can clearly see the difference between contingent harm of males is lesser as compared to the females. Even though it is somewhat similar.\n Yeah, what you see here is the two lines: the dark green and the light green that represents the males and the females. For harm aversion, for that you should look at how much it changes from the baseline through the three shock sessions. And the change is exactly the same in males and females. But the difference between the two curves that you see is the fact that the females started off with the higher preference than the males did. But the reduction in preference is same across groups.\n Tell us more about the observed differences between these rats.\n Between which rats? Rats, you mean, in general in the experiment?\n In general, like the rats, which were on the extremes, how extreme were they on the case-by-case basis?\n Well, that you can see, if you look at Figure 3b in particular, you can see that some examples on the top of 3b of rats that had started off with a very strong preference for that were around 100 on the baseline session. And it stayed at 100. So they absolutely didn't care at all. And in the other case, if you look at the bottom panel, you have some animals that initially had a preference around kind of 80%. And by Day 3, they really go down to 0% of the shock lever used. So it's really a very substantial difference; some changes much as they possibly could and some don't change at all.\n What could be the possible reason for this?\n Yeah, it's a good \u2014 if we knew that, we would be very happy. I think the things that we did look at and didn't play major difference is actually the reaction of the demonstrator. So the first thing we figured perhaps you have demonstrators that really squeak a lot, and others, that don't give a lot of pain signals, and that could could explain the difference. Then we quantified the reaction of the demonstrators, we saw there were no major differences there. Where we did see really, big differences is in the reaction of the observer. So we saw that there is some observers for instance, when they realised that they had shocked the other one, they really stopped to do anything for a while, and took longer to go get their food and ate the food very quickly. So they really showed that they were disturbed by these shocks. And those were the ones that switched. And then were other rats that didn't seem to mind at all, they just kept eating their food as if nothing had happened. And those ones were the ones that didn't switch. So we feel that there's really just a striking difference in how much attention as well the agent paid to the harm signals of the other person.\n But the causes are not known. The causes of these are not: could be different brain activity, it could be the relationship between the distress that the observer perceives from the other that stops them to do anything, or actually motivates the other. I mean, there are a lot of factors that could play a role. And we are trying to think of it: how to test and untangle this aspect apart. But it is not easy, but it is definitely a topic we are interested in.\n How much do we know about the evolution of harm aversion?\n Yeah, well we don't know that much. So from a kind of biological point of view, kind of it's only over the past, I would say, 10-20 years, that evolutionary biology is really paying a lot of attention to kind of and . Because if you read kind of traditional and evolutionary kind of books, they underline the selfishness of individuals. So the idea that you mainly need to survive yourself, and that other animals are really competitors. And then more slowly, people started to say, \"well of course, you care about your kids, because they have a lot of your and therefore, that makes sense\". And it's only quite recently that people start to really see that even if you are not really related to another animal, but kind of you help each other, your whole kind of herd or group ends up better-off. And the individual ends up being better-off. Because often, rats actually, or animals have a sense of mutualism. So if someone was kind to you at some point, you're more likely to be helped by that person in the future. So that helping others is a way to facilitate being helped by them in the future. And so, it still is a relatively young field of research that really acknowledges the fact that kind of in social animals, that live in groups. And individuals will really do things for others kind of and that this is beneficial for evolution. So it's really only starting to be explored.\n Is the ACC responsible for harm aversion in other vertebrates too?\n Yeah, so what we know is that for instance, in monkeys, the cingulate seems to be necessary as well to, for instance, decide to work, to give juice to someone else. So, in the they have some paradigms where you see a symbol on the screen that means that if you now do something, there can be juice for yourself. And a different symbol if you work will give juice to another monkey, and a third symbol if you work that one, there'll be juice that's delivered in an empty glass. And what you see is that monkeys that really work hard for themselves, but they're also willing to work a little bit to give juice to another monkey. And that's more than they are willing to work if the juice is just gonna get wasted in as glass. And there as well, the ACC seems to be important to motivate the monkey to work for another monkey and that's the other example that we know. In mice, there is some evidence that if you disrupt the cingulate, then the mouse will no longer freeze when it see[s] another one getting shocked. But that's it. As far as I know, there's no other animal that has been explored.\n Are there any ethical considerations around conducting this study?\n Yes, of course! So, we ourselves, of course do not particularly like to have to give shocks to one animal. So the only reason we really do these experiments is that we feel that harm aversion is such an important phenomenon. Because in human society, when people lack harm aversion, they really cause a \"lot\" of damage to society. Both because they harm people, and they end up in prison and that has a huge cost; but as well for the fact that these individuals really erode trust and they harm in a way the interaction that all of us have with each other. Because we are always afraid that the person we have in front of us might be someone that will take advantage of you and harm you. So I think, in understanding how that works in the brain is really really important. And because of that, we feel that it's important to really understand how it works. And currently, working with animals is the only way that we can really modify brain activity and see if it changes behaviour.\n In future, might you test this hypothesis with different species?\n Yes, we might do it in mice. So, of course, for other people, rats and mice are pretty much the same thing, but kind of there is a difference between them. And ultimately, we hope we can do this in humans. But for that, we need techniques in which we can modify brain activity in deeper brain regions.\n You can do it once in a while in patients that already suffer from and normally the surgeons inserts electrodes to measure, to find out the source of epilepsy, and you can at times stimulate to see whether the region is essential in some of the normal behaviour. So at times, you can have access to these patients and ask them to participate in our task and we have a couple of collaborations, that we hope that will help us to tell something more about the role of the ACC and the in these type of tasks. And we are also currently trying to develop methods that are human-friendly, in the sense that they are not invasive, and to be used in active participants to try to disrupt the activity of these regions as well. Nowadays it's not easy to do because the TMS that [is] normally used to simulate the brain in humans, the , is not very well suited to reach deeper structure. Like the ACC goes really inside and it's a bit curved as well. You can reach with TMS, but it's not the cleanest way. So we are also trying to see whether we can use, for instance, stimulation to do it and test it directly in humans. Of course, it will also make use of data that comes from patients that show damages in the ACC. And it was a study from Ralph Adolphs in the past that did confirm that some of these regions like insula for instance, are important and essential for discriminating emotions for instance, so, you can also test in these patients: use our tasks and test these patients. So there are bit, some ways, to do it in humans, but it's quite small so we are investing, but the results take longer. And of course, when you use patients, you always have the problem of reorganisation of the brain structure that you are looking at, possibly, so.\n Is there a way to increase the degree of harm aversion in anti-social beings?\n Yeah, that's the question we are really interested in, and we don't know. And that's why we are interested in finding out whether a particular region like the ACC is necessary for the development, or for the behaviour to occur. Because once we know, we can confirm that in humans as well, what you could think are several ways. You can manipulate plasticity in that region, so, ask the participants to go do certain tasks where they learn something. And while you are modifying for instance, the {w|neuroplasticity|plasticity}} of the brain with current or magnetic simulation. Or you can think of targeted therapies, for instance like , when you project the activities of the areas where the participants doing a task and the participants can directly modify through visual feedback the activity of these areas coming up. So that if I now project on the screen the activity, real-time, the activity of the particular regions, I can tell you \"okay, try find a way to modify that region\". So you would come up with thinking of something, you know, it's just a random process, but you could come up with a task saying like, \"Okay, if I think of how my friend is feeling now, I see that manipulated region\". And then you can practice and practice to the point that it becomes automatic kind of things and that activity of that region now is modified based on your exercise and your activity.\nSo there are ways that we hope we may be able to use in the future to see whether we can use, can maybe improve or help these people to care more about. But again we need to identify not just the region that is involved, but also at what point of the decision-making is happening. So is it the motivation that is lacking, is just the attention, or is the general level of activity of that area, I mean, we don't know yet. What is the reason why harm is done or you don't care to the other. And if you consider that these decisions are always or in most of the cases this balance between a cost and a benefit, what you need to do is we need to readjust the cost-benefit balance which complicates the thing a little bit more. But that's the way we want to go but it's the future. So you also have this ethical aspect like, so it depends what \u2014 if somebody, like, with psychopathy, is just in the tail of the normal distribution right, so it is not just the specific dysfunction, but it's just a normal variability that went to the extreme, right, then where would you put the line and say, \"Okay, now I intervene to change these and when I don't\". Because we know that certain traits or certain aspects of psychopathy can be useful in society as well. So, then it becomes an ethical problem of when do we actually intervene? And do we want to intervene early in kids that already manifest aggressive behaviour, or do we need to let them experience it and then act later on.\nSo there are a lot of considerations before doing interventions on these topics.\n Are there any future plans to explore more on the harm aversion and its evolution?\n Ah, yes there are a lot of plans and, roads, let's say. One of the plans we have is to really understand a little bit even more in details what is happening in the brain, at the cellular level and which are the inputs of these are involved, what type of neurons are involved and all these aspect[s], we are also interested in trying [to] understand the developmental curve, what is happening, for instance, if you are exposed to a very stressful life when you're young, what kind of consequence it has on harm aversion later in life. And we are interested in seeing how it is also transmitted through generations, like if you have these variabilities between individuals, with some individuals having higher propensity to be prosocial, or whether, you know, you select individuals that are mostly prosocial, would this selection be brought forward in the next generation. So we also want also to see how much is learned and how much is more genetically encoded. So all these aspects, we are trying to tackle with different experiment. And let's hope we \u2014 of course the other aspects are very early at this stage.\n What are the other research you are currently working on?\n [laughs] You want them all? No, okay, so as I mentioned from the animal's point-of-view, we are doing, we want to do on the, a bit more of the physiology, and up the genetic to discover the role of the ACC and each single cell of the ACC, as I mentioning before. So, is it for instance, let's say, what type of cells is involved in mapping the other pain into my own pain. And where the information comes from, so what is the circuit that is involved, and how the other things change the information: this is one aspect of one of the experiments we're gonna run.\nIn humans, for instance, we are also, we've been implementing a lot of learning paradigms, similar to the one in this paper where people are faced with two symbols: they have to understand what are the consequences of choosing one versus the other and one symbol most often brings you higher reward, monetary reward, but also you would also see the other be more in pain, and the other symbol is the opposite. And we again want to understand whether the circuit that is involved is the same as we see in the animal and vice-versa. And again, whether we would like to simulate some of the areas we find, to see how the causality between this particular brain activity and the behaviour. And we are also curious to see whether it matters, whether you see the other person being in pain in front of you, for instance, compared to simply receiving a message that the other person is in pain. Because we believe that the embodiment component mainly comes into play when you see the other person. You can also recall some embodiment processes through text. But whether there is a difference between the two, we don't know. So we are also interested in that aspect, and also interested in differentiating whether when you encounter such a type of conflict, whether there is a negative consequence like pain vs money as a reward; whether you value the pain of the other similarly to how much you value the pain for yourself.\nAnd this is just a glimpse on all the things we are are doing. I would say, on this aspect. We also are interested in experiments that are trying to see how [we] ourselves encode emotions, do we have cells that code for happiness and cells that code for pain, painfulness or sadness or the cells simply encode the negative and positive aspect towards how strong it is. Independently of a specific emotion. So these are also other questions we have. Unless you want to mention more, but I think it is plenty.\n Yeah.\n Yeah.\n What is your role at the ?\n Yeah, so we basically are both of us department heads, so that means that we each have a a group of people we basically manage. And of course we really work very very closely together. So our two groups kind of together form what we call the Social Brain Lab which is basically investigating how our brain processes the emotions of others and reacts to them.\n Well, that were all the questions we had for you both.\n Okay. Very good.\n Is there something you would like to add?\n No.\n No, I think it was quite thorough. Yeah.\n Thank you very much for agreeing for this [interview]. It was great pleasure discussing this with you.\n You are welcome.\n Thank you.\n Thank you. B-bye. Have a good day.\n Thank you.\n Bye.\n Bye."}

The study stated the black hole is about 1010 \u00b1 195 (310 \u00b1 60 ) away from the , meaning it is the nearest known black hole from the . The nearest previously known black hole \u2014 \u2014 the study noted was usually estimated at more than 3000 light years away.\nThe black hole described in the study is located in the of Telescopium constellation, making it the first system visible to the to contain a black hole. HR 6819 contains two stars, and they are visible from the . The astronomers started observing the system in 1999. Initially, they thought it was just a binary system, consisting of two stars. However, upon examination, the researchers concluded there was a third unseen object in the system. One of the two stars in the HR 6819 system is close to the black hole and orbits the black hole in just 40.333 \u00b1 0.004 days.\nThis newly discovered black hole does not have an . A black hole forms an accretion disk when a significant amount of matter orbits the black hole, as depicted in the image. Accretion disks often emit . Since this black hole does not have an accretion disk, researchers had to rely on the gravitational effect of the black hole on the nearby star in order to discover it.\nResearchers used the to conclude the black hole had a mass of at least 4.2 M\u2609 (; 1 Solar mass = mass of the Sun). Its companion star, which orbits the black hole in about 40 days, is classified as a . The outer star is classified as a . Be stars rotate very quickly around their axes. Since the outer star rotates so rapidly, the star is not exactly spherical, but instead , bulged at its equator, forming a gas disk around the equator.\nThe research suggested HR 6819 was very similar to another system . The HR 6819 system is estimated to be between 15\u201375 million years old (). The inner star has estimated mass of at least 6.3 \u00b1 0.7 M\u2609. Using the mass and the speed at which the inner star rotates, the researchers concluded the black hole had an estimated mass of 5.0 \u00b1 0.4 M\u2609.

And about the future investigations.\n Ah, well yes, do you have any specific question? I mean, the future investigation is to make sure that it really is a black hole and we will probably do that by means of . What we ultimately want to get is: you probably have seen the animation, it is a sequence of images that looks like this animation. The two moving around: not around each other, but with a third object.\n What prompted your interest in astronomy?\n Oh, astronomy in general. That is very long. You see, when I was maybe ten years old, I was already very interested in astronomy and started observing from backyard with a . It's actually that got me into physics and mathematics, and then I studied physics. There was a time I was not sure if I would end up in astronomy or or something else. But in the end, I always decided to continue the astronomy path.\n Could you briefly explain this discovery and its findings?\n Well, it is a long story indeed. Because originally we thought it was a \u2014 just two objects \u2014 not three. And that would have been interesting because these two stars are similar in many senses. Like they have a similar mass. They are similarly old. They are consequently of similar temperature, et cetera. But in one aspect they are very different. Namely, one is rotating very very fast. It is a so-called . Which means it is rotating so fast that it is almost flying apart. There's actually material flowing off the equator. And the other is rotating rather slowly.\nSo the original investigation was to figure out why two stars, that are so similar \u2014 that must have formed together \u2014 why they would be they so different. And now this is not something we could answer in the end because the distant system is of a different structure. But instead we found that it is of a different structure and there are three objects, but only two of them visible. And that means, if you put the data we get into and and the rotation, you find that the third object must be very massive. And if you don't see it but it is very massive, that means it cannot be a star.\n And that is how you concluded it was a black hole?\n Yes. How we concluded it's a black hole is we derive the mass from these 's and 's laws. And then we see if, given the quality of data we have, if it would be possible to detect the star with such a mass. And we went through several options down to the faintest possible stars we could imagine, with such a mass, and there is no such object. Our data is good enough that we would have seen such a thing. And therefore, if it is , it must be a black hole.\n What drew the team's attention to this stellar system, , in the ?\n Well in the first place, because it was in a catalogue of these extraordinarily rapidly rotating stars: the Be stars. They are really so rapidly rotating that they are . They are not round, not anymore, but they are oblate. And they have a gas disk that is flowing off the equator because they rotate almost at . And that is basically my research, in what is forming this.\n Why did the team start observing HR 6819 specifically?\n As I said, because it's a Be star. There are about 100\u2013200 Be stars which are of that brightness. And maybe 150 visible from the southern . And so over the many years, we have taken, not all, but a fair fraction of them, and we started off with relatively few , with only ten spectra. And with this, we slowly sought our way through which are interesting and which are not and at some point, this [system HR 6819] did strike us interesting because we thought it was binary.\n And when did the research team start observing?\n The first observations, these few spectra were taken 1999. And the second set of spectra was taken 2004.\n What was the most fascinating aspect of this finding?\n Well, for me, it's the realisation that black holes are very common. I mean, I knew the numbers: that you get about one black hole per thousand stars. But that actually means there must be some black holes rather nearby. And originally, you would expect most of them single, so that you would never find them, because they are very small, very black. Nothing to see there. But when they are in a multiple system, then you can see them through their gravitational influence on the other stars. And, so that basically was, I think, the best finding, that it is a multiple system \u2014 a stable multiple system. Many stars are in multiple systems. But when a black hole is formed via , you would actually think that many of these systems get destroyed: disrupt[ed] by the explosion. This did not happen.\n What technologies were used for this discovery?\n . In other words, spectroscopy is a technology by which you spread the light, you resolve the light into the individual . And then you can see the signature of the chemical elements as they form in the star. And these signatures \u2014 you usually assume they have a fixed wavelength. If you observe them at a slightly different wavelength, this is due to the . And so with this doppler effect, we could see that one of the stars was moving, not at a constant speed, but it was moving back and forth with a relatively high velocity. Amplitude of 60/s [about 37 per ]. And a long of 40 .\nAs I said, with the combination of Kepler's and Newton's law that is called the , you can use these numbers to get a mass of what it must orbit about. It's a principle, the same technology we use for finding planets, which is called .\n How did \"you\" get involved in this study?\n From the very beginning. As I said, I was interested in Be star[s]. Actually most of the team [...] We were originally arranging this observations of many Be stars and it just turned out this one was particular very interesting.\n Apart from [the] European Southern Observatory, which other observatories were involved in this discovery?\n Uh, none. So only European Southern Observatory plus the observatory at La Silla. Two different telescopes.\n Okay. Which were the two telescopes?\n The 1.52 and 2.2. The point is we always use the same instrument but it was moved at some point from ESO 1.52 to the 2.2m of the .\n Were all the observations made from the La Silla Observatory?\n From La Silla not. There \"are\" other observations available, but we have not used them yet in this study. There are observations available that were made by , there's a data based of amateur spectroscopy, there are observations in the archives that were made from the . So at some point, we are going to look at all those observations, but for the discovery purpose, we only used the observations that were taken from La Silla.\n How many people were involved in this discovery?\n Right now the paper has I think five co-authors. And there is a sixth person, Stan \u0160tef, who some years ago died in a car accident. And I believe \u2014 the paper is dedicated to him. He is not on the co-author list because this particular paper was written completely new. And if he never had a chance to actually even read the draft, then someone should not be co-author.\n What were the roles of the people involved in the discovery?\n Marianne Heida and Dietrich Baade were the ones that originally triggered the idea. Well, it's a long study because originally, we studied if for a different purpose. In this different purpose, it was me, Dietrich Baade, and Petr Hadrava. And we wanted to study it as a binary. Robert Klement was a student of Petr Hadrava and he then also later and now assisted in the study of binary parameters. And Marianne Heida is an expert on X-ray binaries, which have a lot of black holes. So she was originally putting us on the track by presenting another paper on a black hole.\n What was the timeline of this study?\n Well, it took 20 years, as I said; we started observing in 1999. This is a typical scientific discovery: you find something you are not looking for.\n Which activity took the most time and attention?\n Well, what took the most time was basically to realise that there is something that unusual in it. As I said, we originally thought it was something different. And then analysed it. Found it was not what we had expected and so on and all that drags it out. And then of course there's that Stan \u0160tefl was a major driver in the study. He died in 2014 which basically stalled the study after that until now.\nIt was now that we picked it out because there was another paper appearing on a similar object, which, looking at that paper, I realised that HR 6819 must be of the same type.\n What was the most difficult part of this investigation?\n As it basically is for any investigation: you very early on have an idea what it might be. And it is always, the most difficult part is to always to make it sure in such a way that also the colleagues would believe it. You have to explore any other options, any possibilities and exclude them one-by-one.\n What was your first reaction when confirming the unseen member of the triplet was a black hole?\n Well it depends. I mean, the first suggestion that it was a black hole surfaced in 2010. But then we were very cautious. Because we were not quite sure. At that point we hadn't really excluded everything else. And so, this was a very cautious time. And then Stan died, but when I looked at it back in 2019, I managed to convince myself relatively quickly now, whatever I had learned in the past six years.\n How old is this system?\n Judging from the two other stars that still exist in there, these two other stars must [be] between 15 and 70 million years old (). Probably closer to the high upper end. Probably closer to 70 million years. That is probably the age of the system.\n How rare is the occurrence of the stellar systems with black holes?\n Well, when we are talking about black holes of the , not supermassive black holes like are in the hearts of the galaxies, only 50 of them are known. And most of them are in binaries. Because, as I say, a single black hole is almost impossible to find. It is, however, one of the first we are certain of, or at least the one we are most certain that it is not in binary \u2014 one companion \u2014 but a triple, with two companions.\n How different are the stellar systems with black holes as compared to the ones without it?\n Well, black hole is the end phase of the . So every triple system that has a star with higher than 12 solar masses, at some point must have a supernova explosion that results in either a or a black hole. The question is not \u2014 these progenitor systems, they are very abundant, they exist everywhere. The question is how frequently they survive these explosions. That is something completely unknown. But I suspect there are quite many of them.\n This black hole does not have an accretion disk. What does this tell us about the system?\n Not very much. It will eventually acquire an accretion disk. The two other stars are not very evolved. They are still small and compact. As soon as they start evolving \u2014 in particular, the inner one \u2014 it will grow, and once it has grown enough, the black hole will start to accrete from it. But there is a couple of million years to go still, at least.\n Tell us about the orbits of the two stars in HR 6819.\n Well the inner orbit is relatively fast. It's 40 days. That's not an unusual , for two stars. But, the amplitude is very high: the speed with which they orbit each other is high: it is 60\u00a0km/s. And together with the 40 days, that makes a minimum mass of the other object. The outer orbit we don't know. It is \"very\" far away. It's probably, judging from the similarity to other systems [...], it is probably several decades. It could be even long[er].\n How close do these stars get? \n Since the orbit is circular, they will always stay at the same distance \u2014 at least the inner two, the black hole and the other star. For now, they will stay at the same distance. They will not get closer or farther from each other. They are about as far as, closer than the and the (1, 150 million km (93 million miles). The precise value is not known because it depends on the of the system: whether we see the system edge-on, or whether we see it face-on.\n Is the black hole assigned an official name?\n For naming, naming is the job of . So. Traditionally you would call it as Component A, Component B, Component Aa: something like that. But even that, I am not entirely sure how that would go. Because whether you do this by mass, or sometimes you call the \"A\" which the most massive, sometimes you call \"A\" which is the most brightest, so.\n Does the team refer to the name by an unofficial name?\n No. Not really.\n What are some of the properties of this black hole?\n Ah, black holes don't really have properties. It's mass. That's it. It has at least the mass of 4.3 Solar [Mass], which means it has a diameter of maybe about 30\u00a0km (18.64 miles). That's about it. There's not many more properties a black hole can have.\n When I asked about the properties of the black hole, I was hoping you would remark on the spin, and the charge.\n The radius is about 15\u00a0km (9.3 miles), as I said. Nothing is known about spin or charge, but it is likely that charge is zero or close to that.\n What do we know about the history of this black hole?\n Only that it comes from a supernova, and that the triple system still survives. That is basically telling us something about the explosion must have been symmetric in a sense. Because if it had been asymmetric, the system would have been disrupted.\n What are the affects of the black hole on the star closer to it?\n None. It's pulling \u2014 the gravity \u2014 but another star would just pull the same. So it has no radiation. It has not accrete. It is only forcing it into an orbit. Nothing else.\n What were the challenges the team faced to discover this black hole?\n Well, as I said before, it is basically to make sure that you have excluded all other options. It's really: science is really about excluding the alternatives and, so that finally only one possibility remains.\n How are the black holes with the accretion disk different form those which don't have one?\n Ah, if they have something to accrete, then something falls into the black hole. And in that process, they produce all sorts of emission. They produce X-ray emission, . And ours does too, but it really is just black.\n As you mentioned, x-ray emission helps detecting the black holes with accretion disk. What are some of the other ways we can detect black holes without accretion disks?\n Ah, I don't think there's many other ways. You wouldn't get them unless they have another object which you can detect. And then you have to infer it from the gravitational effects, like its orbit.\n Do these stars orbiting the black hole have any known planets?\n Ah, no, and considering their type, it is rather unlikely. These kinds [...] as far as I know don't really have planets. They are too violent, the deformation process is too massive. Planets are normally around older or less massive stars.\n The report mentioned the spectroscopic time series of HR 6819 was similar to LB-1. Tell us more about the system LB-1.\n It's basically the same. This was a press release form the Chinese National in November. And back then they claimed it is only a binary, one is a normal star, the other is a black hole. It has an accretion disk. And from this they infer it could have had very high mass. But from a technical point of view, this type of analysis is incorrect. It was, at least to me, looking at the system it looks fairly clear that the effect they ascribe to the black hole which they thought was an accretion disk must be an outer object \u2014 a third star nearby \u2014 of this Be type, which makes the emission line. So it is basically looking at the paper and realising that they are not right in their result but I know what it is, and that realising I have something similar just in my drawer.\n In what ways are LB-1 and HR 6819 similar and dissimilar?\n They are similar in \"almost\" every aspect. The inner , as far as we can tell at the moment. The B star that is close to the black hole [of LB-1] is rotating even slower than in HR 6819. It could be that it has been a bit modified: that it already has either transferred mass to the black hole or the progenitor of the black hole has transferred mass[...] For [HR] 6819, there's no such indication. But otherwise, we believe they are essentially the same.\n In what ways would the be different if the Sun was in the inner star's orbit, orbiting this black hole?\n It would not exist. As I said, planets simply would not form around such a massive binary. Planet formation around binary in principle is possible. But the inner star would have been a star with at least 12, maybe 20 solar masses. And these stars form very quickly, burn very quickly, die very quickly. Planets would simply not have had the time to form along such an object.\n No, considering \"our\" Solar System was there.\n Right now? Well, if you just \"put\" a Solar System there, that exists, it would probably destroy Mercury, it wouldn't exist, it would be not in a stable orbit. Probably also Venus would not be in a stable orbit. In the region of Earth, the orbit \"could\" be stable. So \"maybe\" Earth could just so barely exist. The would be different. There would be a strong 40-day modulation, which makes every 20 days \u2014 or every 40 days you get a lot of radiation. Every 40 days, you get only much less radiation. So it would be very hostile to life.\n What were the different radiation emissions observed in this system?\n There is only visible light so far. We know of no other [].\n What are some of the other observed systems that have similar radiation emission?\n As I said, this is from the point-of-view of the stars, these are just normal stars. And the black hole does not contribute anything to the emission of the radiation.\n What does the future of these stars look like?\n The outer star will just evolve very normally just like any other star of its mass. The inner star will become a as well. But when it ends its supergiant phase, it will be big enough to get accounted into the black hole and then the black hole will start accreting. It is hard to say what happens then. It may get big enough for the black hole to actually fall into the star, and then shortly after the star falls into the black hole, or it might end with the accretion.\n So you are saying there is a chance the black hole may create an accretion disk feeding on this inner star?\n It will certainly. But it will take another few million years.\n Were you expecting a black hole to be so close to the Solar System?\n Ah yes, as I said, there must be many black holes. I mean, there are certainly black holes which are closer. It's just not very likely to find them. They are not \"in\"frequent objects. They are interestingly very frequent objects. There are just very hard to find.\n What future investigations is your team planning for?\n With interferometry, we want to image that, and maybe we want to look in the catalogues if we can find a similar system. We are looking for candidates where we might reasonably expect that it might be similar and then we can have a look in detail.\n What lies ahead in this system to be discovered?\n Well, basically what we still have to do with this system is to make the numbers certain. Right now, what we have is limits. We have a lower limit for the mass. But what we can do is we get precise value for the mass. We only have a rough distance, we can get a precise distance. We can measure the chemical composition of the stars that still exists, if they in any way have been altered or affected by the original primary, when the most massive star went supernova. So it should tell us a lot, in principle, about heterogeneous systems about how such massive stars evolve.\n Are there any plans to observe the nearby binary stars for black holes?\n As I said, we are looking into the catalogues. If we can find similar systems that could give us hints, that might be promising candidates. But even if they are frequent, they are not that frequent that we could observe every star and just look for black holes. That is not an efficient use of telescope time.\n Are there any other observations you have been working on?\n Ah, well, there's a lot of things I'm working on. But they are unrelated to this particular project.\n What is your role at the ESO?\n At the ESO, I am a science operations astronomer. Which means that I run the telscopes; I support other astronomers when they come here to conduct the observations, and when they cannot come, or do not want to come which also happens, I do the observations for them. And I do this about 60% of my working time, I work for the observatory in this capacity, and one third of my working time I do my own research.\n Well, those were all the questions I had for you. Is there something you would like to add?\n No, I think that was fine, thank you.\n Thank you for agreeing for this interview. It had been a great pleasure discussing this with you.\n Thank you. \"Ciao\"."}

I would like to discuss the study, and the inferences; as well as what lies ahead to be studied.\n What prompted your interest in astronomy?\n Why I am interested in astronomy?\n Yeah.\n Uhh... [laughs] because it's fun. [laughs] Because it's \u2014 it's about objects that are very far from us, and which we never observed before. So it's always very challenging to understand astrophysical objects which are very distant from us; and very different from what we see in the , for instance.\n How did you get involved with this study?\n I was involved because I also took part in the building of the instrument. So the instrument that we used at the Very Large Telescope; instrument is a [Spectro-Polarimetric High-Contrast Exoplanet Research]. And so we started the design of the instruments back in 2005, I would say. So I was involve[d] already at this step. And then when the instrument was implemented on the sky, on the telescope, I was also involved in the survey, that was accomplished with this telescope. And, in addition to the survey \u2014 in addition to all the observations that the of people who built the instrument was running \u2014 I also had my own programs with other colleagues. And this result is part of these other programs.\n Was this instrument built specifically for this research?\n It was built for imaging exoplanets and also .\n What drew your attention to in the in the first place?\n Well it's because it was already observed before, of course, so we knew that there was a around the star. And the most recent images were obtained with Alma: the . It's an working in . And from this telescope, we already had a suspicion that there might be a planet in formation in this disc. And this is why we decided to use SPHERE to observe this system.\n Could you explain this study and its findings?\n Yes so: so AB Aurigae is a star which is more massive than the , but also very very young. The Sun is like 4.5 billion years old; while AB Aurigae is probably only like 5 million years old. So very young. And around young stars, we expect planets could be very bright because we are observing in the . And so we knew that there was a protoplanetary disc around AB Aurigae. That means a system with a lot of gas, and a lot of dust. And so when we see this, you can find out that this gas and this dust will evolve into planets. So this is what we focused on. We decided to observe with SPHERE in order to observe the very details in the protoplanetary system of AB Aurigae and try to identify if there was [a] planet in the system. And so what we find is that we have a lot of structures. And we call these spirals because they have shapes and these spirals are in fact gas, which are taking this shape. And usually, when we see a spiral, we can infer that there is an object which is the gas. The gravitation impact of an object in the gas produces a spiral. So when you see a spiral in a disk, you try to find which object has triggered the spiral. Because you know that it's produced by an instability. So this instability could be anything, but it could be also [a] planet: [a] planet in formation. So we try to identify if some of these pattern[s], structures in the disk could be related to the presence of a planet. And so, when we get the images from SPHERE, we find that one of the spiral[s] was twisted. And it's not a perfect spiral, you have a kind of structure at the tip of one of the spirals, which looks like a twist. Like if the spiral was twisted. And this is exactly what we expect from modelisation, from . When you ask people doing modelling, what looks like a system in which a planet is forming, and if you have gas in this system, what the image looks like, and they will give you an image which resembles a lot what we observe in AB Aurigae. So we did not observe a planet, okay? We never detect[ed] a planet. We detect[ed] a structure which could be the impact of a planet on to the gas. On to this spiral. So this is indirect: indirect\ndetection.\nThe other problem is that we don't know which mass is creating this structure, this spiral. So we see the spiral, we see the structure, we have theories indicating that it could be [a] planet. But we are not able to measure the mass of the object. So, we concluded that it \"could\" be a planet, but it could be also something more massive than a planet. Like maybe a for instance, an object a little bit more massive than a planet. So it's still a study that is ongoing. We are continuing the observations in order to determine if this is actually a planet in formation, or if it is another type of object.\n What was the timeline of the study?\n Oh, the timeline was typically we started by asking telescope-time. So, requesting telescope-time like a year\nago; last year, basically. The request for observing time was accepted. And then, the observation were executed in December 2019. Last year.\n Were you initially looking for signs of formation of an exoplanet \"specifically\"?\n Yes, definitely. This is exactly why we are observing very young star. Because we know that the planets are forming when a star is very young; so when it's like one million or five million years old. And it took about probably a million year for a planet to form. So it is important to look at very young planet, if you want to understand how the planet forms, you need to look at very young systems.\n How many countries were involved in the study?\n Countries! Oh, so we have some people from France, people from US, people from Taiwan, and people from Belgium. So we have four countries.\n And how many people were involved in this study?\n Let me check exactly the number of people if I can. I think we were like ten people? I can check directly. There are one, two, three [counts]. We are eleven people.\n And what are their roles?\n Oh, the roles of the other people? Okay, so the other people contributed to the interpretation of the data, mostly. So once we have done the observation, we need to understand what we are observing. So we need to compare the observation with models for instance. So, a lot of people contributed to this comparison. Some people contributed to making a link with the previous data we have with ALMA. And that's basically the role of the other people. And some of them also contributed to the writing of the paper.\n From which observatory were the observations made?\n They were made from the Very Large Telescope in Chile.\n Which activity took the most time and attention?\n That's a good point. [laughs] I think it's definitely the last: the last phase, of writing the paper.\n And what was the most difficult part of this investigation?\n Well the most difficult was to be convinced that we are actually looking at something which is very new, so we need to convince ourselves that it's valuable for scientific publication. It's not specifically hard, but it requires to be convinced, so to make sure that you have done the analysis correctly. You don't make any mistake, et cetera.\n What was your first reaction when you concluded it is likely to be the formation of an exoplanet?\n I think it was very \"exciting\", even though we don't have an image of an exoplanet directly. Having even a suspicion that it could be a planet-forming, since it is very new; it was very exciting.\n What was the most fascinating aspect of this study?\n Well again it's about the same question but, I think it gives it gives some perspective in the work. So it's a system for which we will re-observe, ask more telescope time to perform more observation, because if we confirm that it's a planet in formation then it becomes very important to follow up. So to monitor the system, make sure that it's a planet, make sure that it rotates around the star, et cetera.\n What were some of the challenges the team faced during the study?\n The challenges?\n Yes.\n Um. Well the challenges [are]: first, to get very good observation; and, well you know, when you observe at the telescope, sometimes the conditions are good, sometimes they are not so good. And I think we were very lucky to have very good \u2014 extremely good condition, in fact. So the fact that we see very clearly something is also related to the quality of the data, the quality of the telescope, of the instruments. So that's the first challenge to get the data with a very good quality. And then the second challenge is to compare the observation with the models. Because there are many models. Some are more or less complex. Some are very detailed. Some are less detailed. And you have to figure out which one is the most appropriate for the comparison. Because you don't want to make an interpretation that is too far. You don't want to conclude something that is not very correct. So you need also to make sure that you use the right model. And so, you use one of the models that exists. It's not the most sophisticated. It's the one, on the opposite, which is almost the simplest. Because it's enough to interpret the images, in fact. So now, of course we need to think about models that are more detailed in order to explain the observations.\n Which technologies were used on this study?\n So we use a technology called which is something which is integrated into the instrument which is able to correct for the . So, when the light from the star cross[es] the of the , it becomes blurred. And we are correcting this blurring in order to have very very fine detail on the images. So that's one of the one of the technolog[ies] we are using.\nThe second one is . So exactly like a system which is able to observe the . So you block: when you block the Sun and you try to see around the Sun, well it's the same sort of technology but applied to stars instead of the Sun. So all the stars \u2014 and so the stars are much smaller \u2014 and this system is able to block the light from the star, so you can see everywhere around, and look for planets, look for discs, look for structures. These are the two main technologies we used.\n Why were these two technologies ideal for \"this\" study?\n Oh, um yeah, it's not the only ones but yeah, they are necessary to perform this study, definitely. Yeah.\n What makes \"this\" study unique?\n Well, it's not unique because we have already many observation of planetary systems. We have a lot of observation of disks \u2014 protoplanetary disks \u2014 and especially SPHERE has observed a lot of them. We also have images of planets. And we know that planet are forming inside disks: inside protoplanetary disks. And we know that planet should generate structures like spirals in a disk. So we knew from the theory that planet and spirals are connected, but we never ever made the connection between the two. So we never observed in the same system a planet and the spiral, ok. So here, we don't have exactly observed that because we did not detect the planet, but we detected the presence of the planet in the structure of the spiral. So we are getting one step closer to making the connection between the planet and the spirals, and the structures in the disk.\n What is currently the best explanation for the formation of exoplanets?\n There are several scenarios for forming exoplanets and we have only \u2014 we never \"witness\" planet formation, so we only have theories, which are based on a lot of observations, of course, including observations of the Solar System, planet in the Solar System, et cetera. The analysis of rocks on the Earth as well in the Solar System. But we [have] never seen a planet forming. So, there are several theories. One of them is that you have rocks forming into the system. And these rocks are colliding, they are making bigger rocks. Bigger and bigger. And when this rock has reached a mass which is large enough, like maybe ten times the mass of the Earth, then this big rock, this big planet, starts to accrete the gas. And it becomes a giant planet like Jupiter or Saturn. So that's the theory for forming a giant planet.\nThere are other way to form planet, rocky planet, like the Earth. But here, in fact, the [case] we were talking about \u2014 if it is a planet, it's necessarily a planet that is big like Jupiter, or maybe even bigger. So we believe that the planet form first: the rock of the core of the planet is forming first. And when the core is formed, then it accretes the gas, which literally falls on the core of the planet, and it makes a bigger planet: which is a planet.\n So what kind of exoplanet will this be if this planet forms?\n It will be a giant planet, really. Maybe even bigger than Jupiter. Maybe 10 times the mass of Jupiter. But it couldn't be a planet that is like the Earth. If it were a planet like the Earth, it wouldn't make this kind of spiral. The spiral would not be detectable, in that case. So it's necessarily a very big planet.\n So, is it safe to conclude that it could be a ?\n No, it's not a hot Jupiter. Because, well hot Jupiter means two different type[s] of planets. Jupiter can be hot if it is very close to the star. And this is usually what we refer when we say hot Jupiter. But, when a planet like Jupiter is forming, then the temperature is very high. It's like one thousand, maybe two thousand degrees. So, it's also a hot Jupiter. But not because it's close to the star: because it's young, okay. So here, we are talking about a young Jupiter planet which is probably very warm.\n What do we know about the planetary system that is being formed?\n Well we don't know \"much\", in fact. [laughs] We know we know a little bit about the edge of the system. We know the quantity of gas and dust that is there, and which will form planets anyway. But we don't know yet how many planets are formed; if this planet will survive, et cetera. So there's still a lot to be understood about this system.\n Why do you think this planet may not survive? [...] As you mentioned we do not know if this planet is going to survive.\n Yeah, because some planets: some planet form in the disk, okay. If you have a planet forming in the disk, then the disk is made of gas. And when the planet rotate[s] around the star, then there is a friction with the gas. And so the planet slow[s] down. And when it slow[s] down, it gets closer to the star. And eventually, it can be a hot Jupiter. And sometimes, it can even disappear into the star: swallowed by the star. So we know that some planets are forming in systems and they finally end up merging with the star. They disappear\ninto the star. So we don't know if all planets survive, in fact. Well this one is probably like 30 [an astronomical unit is the distance from the Sun to the Earth, about 150 million km; 93 million miles] away from the star. So it's very far away. There's not a lot of change for this planet to migrate very close and disappear in the star. But we know that it can happen.\n Could you tell us more about the host star?\n The star is more massive than the Sun. It's 2.4 times the mass of the Sun [mass of Sun = about 2\u00d71030 kg]. It's also very young, as I said, only a few million years. Yeah. Essentially that's the two parameters.\n And what do we know about the history of the system?\n Not much. [laugh] Unfortunately, not much. No. We don't even have an exact measurement of the age. Because it can be between like one and five million years old. So it's not very accurate.\n This host star is a star, right?\n Yeah, yeah.\n What are some of the typical characteristics of a Herbig Ae star?\n They are very bright. Because they are very massive, so it's essentially the mass of the star which makes it an Herbig star. And they have also a lot of emissions. So, when we started observing star with , we realised that it had signatures in the spectrum, and in fact, the reason why they have signature is because they have an environment of gas. So, the light from the star is traveling through the gas, and creates some absorption, or emission in some cases. And we see this is a signature in the spectrum. So, the fact that it's a Herbig Ae star means in fact, that it is surrounded by a disk.\n How common are these stars?\n Oh, I don't have a clear idea of that. [laughs] [I] cannot answer.\n And how often do Herbig stars have orbiting planets?\n I don't know if we have already example. I don't think we have many example[s] of planets around the Herbig Ae star. It could be it could be one of the first, in fact, yeah. Not many.\n As you mentioned, the spot formation of this potential planet is quite far from the host star \u2014 30 astronomical units \u2014 what does the distance between this spiral and the star tell us?\n Well it tells us that planet[s] \"can form\" at 30 astronomical units. That's already: I mean if it is \"really\" a planet in formation then it forms at 30 astronomical unit. Which is not of use, in fact. And, in fact, we never, as I said before, we never witnessed a planet at formation. So it tells us that really, a planet can form at such a distance from the star. In the Solar System, 30 astronomical unit is very far. It's the orbit of . But this one is not the Solar System; it's not the Sun. It's more massive than the Sun. So, 30 astronomical units \u2014 it's far away, but not not as far as in the Solar System, okay. But at least we see that it's possible to form as a planet at this position.\n In what ways will this distance affect the planet formation?\n I don't know. Well, we don't have a clear idea of that.\n Were there any unique traits in the orbit of the system?\n The orbit? No. Well we don't have the orbit yet. I mean, we just have an image, and we don't have the full orbit yet. So, we don't really know yet what is the orbit.\n When did you first consider the possibility of it being a birth of an exoplanet, rather than being something else?\n Well, as I said it's when we started to realise that the image was very similar to the models. So, it's a suspicion that it should be a planet forming. Although it's not a firm conclusion, of course.\n What other plausible hypothesis of what this twist might be?\n It could be a more massive object. It could be a . It could be a star also; it's unlikely, but it could be a star. It could be also just what we call in a system. So not always related to planets. But other sort of instability. A planet is somehow an instability because, while it rotates in the disk of gas, it disrupts the disk, the gas and create an instability. But an instability can arise also for other reasons than a planet.\n And how do they rule out the other possibilities?\n Well, we're not completely ruling out the other possibilities. If it were a star, it should have been visible as a star. So, we believe it's not a star. Well, at least it's not likely. And this is why we believe it should be a planet. Something that we don't see directly. We don't detect it.\n Is there a possibility this system might form multiple exoplanets?\n Yes, definitely. Definitely. Because we see a lot of spirals. And if each of the spiral was actually a planet, then that means a lot of planets. So in principle, when a system from one planet, there is no reason for not forming other planets.\n And how many exoplanets are we talking about?\n Oh, we don't know. [laughs] We don't know at all.\n What does the analysis of radiation emission spectrum of the system reveal?\n In fact it's difficult, because it's not straightforward to measure the emission because of the disk. So the disk has a lot of structures and so it's difficult to measure the from the planet. And in fact, we believe that we are not able to detect the flux of the planet. And this is why we conclude that we don't see the planet. So we see only the flux from the gas and the dust in the system, but not from the planet directly.\n What do we know about the composition of the dust and gas in the spiral?\n Well, we know that there are molecules in this system; like , for instance. Certainly also a lot of , of course. And for the dust, it can be any kind of dust because we don't have very strong constraints. So in fact, the dust that we see with SPHERE is different than the dust that we will see with another telescope, because we are not using the same . So with SPHERE's near-infrared we are sensitive to dust that have sizes of a few [1 micron = 0.001 mm] \u2014 little grains \u2014 and we don't see the other big grains, in fact. It doesn't mean that they are not there. It means that we don't have the sensitivity to see it. So there's a whole distribution of dust; dust sizes.\n What kind of atmosphere will this potential planet [be] likely to have in future?\n Well certainly a gas planet; so with an atmosphere of hydrogen and , in majority.\n How many spirals were observed?\n So in the central part we see at least two big spirals. But in fact, all these spirals have little structures, so we see a lot of them. But mostly in the very inner part. And then, if you look at the very outer part, then you see a lot of a lot more spirals. But we believe that these ones are not due to planets, but more to instabilities.\n Were these two spirals interfering?\n Um, yes, probably! Probably. Yeah, if you have more planets in the system, then they all launch spirals. And all of them interfere.\n How big were these spirals?\n How big? They can be several several hundreds of astronomical units.\n What does the next few million years for this system look like?\n Probably that in one million year the planet will be formed. And most of the gas will be dissipated. So, all the disk we see in the image will disappear and we will be left with planets. Or maybe it will take more than one million year. Maybe five or ten. That's the point. We don't know exactly.\n If that is the case this will make it the youngest discovered exoplanet so far, right?\n Yes, if it is an exoplanet, then it's the youngest, yeah.\n When do astronomers use of the stars?\n Well we use an infrared because it's the wavelength where we can use adaptive optics also. So with adaptive optics, we can provide very detailed images. And we need to resolve the very central part of system so we need adaptive optics. So near-infrared is interesting because you can use adaptive optics, and also because it's the range where you expect a planet to be very bright. If you look in the visible [light range], the planet will be very faint.\n How do you test your hypothesis?\n How do we test the hypothesis? Of what \u2014 Of the planet? Of the object being the planet?\n Yes.\n Well, again I think it's: at the moment the only test is to compare with the models. That's the only thing we can do.\n What is your role at the ?\n I'm a researcher. And I work on exoplanets and protoplanetary disks. Yeah, mostly I work also on design of instruments. I'm doing instrumentation and observations and interpretation of observations.\n Is your team planning to study more about this system?\n Yes definitely. We already asked for more telescope time to re-observe AB Aurigae.\n And what do you expect to find about the system this time?\n We would like to confirm first that the structure is still visible. To see if it rotates around the star in a . And if the the shape of the spiral is stable or evolve[s] over time.\n What lies ahead to be discovered about exoplanets?\n A lot of things. [laughs] Many many many things, yeah. [laughs] It will be too long to describe what has to be done on exoplanets. It's really a young science. So, in particular, we need to understand how they form. And what they are made of, also.\n Are we be likely to find more instances of planet formation in the near future?\n Yeah, yes. Definitely. We've instruments like SPHERE or [Gemini Planet Imager] or other instruments that are installed on 8-meter telescopes. Also with the next Space Telescope, , you will find out more planets. The next big telescope on the Earth will be the which is a 38-meter telescope. So also we expect to find more planets.\n How can this discovery influence what we already know about planet formation?\n Again I think it's really because it's a very young system. So we never really observe this stage with SPHERE. We have done that with ALMA \u2014 with the instrument ALMA \u2014 we can observe very young system, but we don't see the same thing. We see mostly big dust, and gas. But with SPHERE, it's really new to be interested in very very young stars.\n What do we now know about planet formation that we didn't know before?\n What we learn is typically that a planet could form at 30 astronomical unit from a star, that is more massive than the Sun. And that it has an impact on the distribution of the gas and the dust. That's mostly what we learned. And of course, this system is a cornerstone, and we'll probably observe more systems like AB Aurigae in the future.\n What are some of the other studies you are currently working on?\n That's typically on other systems that are a bit older than AB Aurigae, in fact. Usually the stars we are observing with SPHERE are like 10 or 20 million years old. It's basically \u2014 less than 50 million years old. Between 10 and 50, say, million years. And they have gas and dust around, so we can detect discs. And so we are performing a survey of hundreds of stars to detect new planets.\n Well, those were all the questions I had for you. Would you like to add anything?\n No. I think we we already covered the subject very much. Thank you for your questions.\n Thank you for agreeing for this interview. It has been a great pleasure discussing this with you.\n Oh, me too. Thank you very much."}

It features original material compiled throughout the previous month after an overview of the month's biggest stories.\nThis month's spotlight on the campaign trail includes interviews with the vice presidential nominees of the Constitution and Libertarian parties as well as the chosen of the leading Green Party presidential candidate. \nSummary.\nAt the beginning of May, with the Coronavirus Pandemic ongoing and s easing in some states, presumptive US Democratic Party presidential nominee Joe Biden led incumbent US President Donald Trump of the Republican Party in the average of head-to-head opinion polls, 47.4 percent to 42.1 percent. In an poll with then-US Libertarian Party presidential candidate Congressman included, Biden led Trump 47 percent to 40 percent with 5 percent for Amash. \nCongressman Amash, who changed his party registration to Libertarian, contended for the Libertarian Party's presidential nomination, but dropped out of the race just ahead of the party's online . At the convention, the party's vice presidential nominee, , won the presidential nomination. Podcaster received the vice presidential nomination. In other third parties, at its own online , the US Constitution Party nominated a ticket of businessman Don Blankenship for president and Michigan Taxpayers Party chairman for vice president. For the US Green Party, former Minnesota joined the party and had signaled an intent to run but ultimately decided against it. Labor activist broadened his lead among pledged Green Party delegates, approaching the number required to secure the nomination at the online , scheduled for July 11. Hawkins, who is also the presidential nominee of the , had his hopes of a left-wing coalition dashed when it was reported the ballot-qualified Peace and Freedom Party of California and the of Vermont chose presidential nominee as their presidential nominee. Hawkins selected 2016 Socialist Party USA vice presidential nominee to be his running mate. \nBiden first addressed the from former staffer Tara Reade, on television program \"\". When confronted with the accusation he penetrated Reade, against her will, using his fingers under her clothing in 1993, Biden told host \"No, it is not true. I am saying unequivocally it never, never happened, and it didn't. It never happened.\" Meanwhile, a new allegation surfaced from a woman, a niece of Biden's opponent , who claimed Biden commented on the size of her breasts when she was 14 years old. The campaign called the statement \"absolutely false.\" An organizer said Biden was not at the event specified. O'Donnell defended her niece's claim, saying it may have taken place at a different time. \nBiden searched for a female running mate. candidate of Georgia, Congresswoman of Florida, Senator of Illinois, Senator Kamala Harris of California, Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, and were mentioned as possibilities. Biden said he planned to announce his choice around August 1. Continuing a trend from earlier months, Biden made a couple of in May. First, he juxtaposed numbers, claiming 85,000 Americans were unemployed and millions had died from coronavirus. More consequential, he told African American radio host \"if you have a problem figuring out whether you\u2019re for me or Trump, then you ain\u2019t black.\" Backlash from the statement led Biden to express \"I shouldn\u2019t have been so cavalier [...] No one should have to vote for any party based on their race, their religion, their background.\" In another incident, as Biden remarked on investigation, shortly before President Trump took office, of then--designee General Michael Flynn, Biden failed to mention his own request at the time to unmask Flynn's identity. The unmasking came to light shortly thereafter in a release of documents related to alleged abuse, which President Trump described as \"Obamagate.\" An analysis of anti-Biden memes showed \"Dementia Joe\" as a popular characterization of Biden. \nPresident Trump made several controversial statements in May. Early in the month, he received additional fallout from a statement he made in late April about the use of disinfectant inside the body to treat coronavirus. He hinted that the would be disbanded, but later reversed himself. Nevertheless, the task force's daily press conferences did cease. Trump said he himself took the drug , which he promoted early in the pandemic as a counter-measure against coronavirus, despite reports about the side effects. He tweeted support for the protests to end statewide shutdown orders despite it undermining his own guidelines. He also promoted an unsubstantiated conspiracy theory suggesting \"Morning Joe\" host Joe Scarborough was involved in the death of a Congressional intern in 2001. When Trump tweeted that state plans to use to allow people to vote from home would result in voter fraud, Twitter placed a disclaimer \"fact checking\" the tweet. In response, Trump issued an making social media that exercises editorial control open to liability. Twitter continued to edit Trump's tweets. Trump tweeted about the that followed the death of , an African American man who died in Minneapolis while a police officer restrained him. Part of Trump's tweet included the statement, \".\" Twitter disallowed comments and likes and placed a warning over the tweet alerting viewers it promoted violence. Trump later said he meant looting leads to somebody getting shot, perhaps by rioters. The phrase itself has historic, racial overtones, of which Trump claimed to be unaware. Meanwhile, Trump attended the joint NASA- and delivered a speech to mark the occasion.\nBy the end of the month, with coronavirus deaths surpassing 100,000 and protests and riots related to the death of Floyd spreading throughout the nation, Biden maintained his lead over Trump in the RealClearPolitics average of opinion polls, 48.4 percent to 42.5 percent. \nSpotlight.\nWilliam Mohr (Constitution Party).\nAt the Constitution Party's 2020 National Convention conducted online May 2, the party nominated businessman Don Blankenship for president on the second ballot. For vice president, the party unanimously chose \u2014 the Constitution Party's affiliate in Michigan \u2014 chairman William Mohr. \nWhile Blankenship has been widely covered for his role as CEO of during the 2010 that resulted in the deaths of 29 miners, his subsequent conviction for misdemeanor conspiracy to violate safety standards willfully, his one year imprisonment, and his unsuccessful for the Republican Party's US Senate nomination in West Virginia, Mohr is relatively unknown.

How do you complement Jo Jorgensen on the ticket?\n How can you improve on the performance of Johnson-Weld in 2016?\nAngela Walker (Green Party).\nOn May 5, US Green Party presidential frontrunner and the presidential nominee of Socialist Party USA, Howie Hawkins, announced his selection of a running mate for the 2020 presidential race. Hawkins, a union leader and co-founder of the Green Party approaching securing the delegates required for the Green Party's presidential nomination, tapped Socialist Party USA's 2016 vice presidential nominee Angela Walker. \nWalker, a truck driver who currently resides in South Carolina, first met Hawkins in 2014 while she was running for Sheriff of , Wisconsin as an independent socialist and Hawkins was for for the Green Party. Walker received 20 percent of the vote in her race and Hawkins received five percent in his. That showing was Hawkins' best in three successive runs for governor \u2014 , 2014, .

Minecraft is a multi-platform commercial game, which was in version when Ahola challenged himself to create something similar to it from scratch, he told \"Wikinews\".\nMinetest is an open-source game, which is free for anyone to download and play. It is written in the , and the is available on code-hosting site GitHub. According to Ahola, Minetest attempts to run on older hardware, with limited graphics, but to be accessible to more people: those who have outdated technology, and making it available for no cost. Minecraft, on the other hand, is a paid game, currently costing USD 26.95 for its computer version. Minecraft is currently owned by Microsoft, and performs poorly on older hardware.\nA correspondent from French Wikinews contacted Perttu Ahola via a few weeks ago, discussing Minecraft. This interview is built on top of the previous interview, as we take a deeper dive into knowing more about this free game which is about to turn ten years old in a few months.\nInterview with Perttu Ahola.\n Can you introduce yourself?\n Hi. Although I'm usually called \"celeron55\" on the Internet, my real name is Perttu Ahola. I'm a and geek from Finland.\n How did you find out about programming?\n I've had programming as a hobby my entire life. When I was a kid I programmed using on my dad's computers and at school and university I attended programming courses and learned more .\n What made you want to create Minetest?\n Initially I took it as a challenge, but after a year of working on it, it turned into this weird quest of trying to figure out what can be done with it that (now Microsoft) won't do. But initially it was the challenge, and the mystery of how a game world like this works under the hood.\n When did you start working on Minetest initially?\n At the beginning of October 2010.\n How many core-developers were working on the development at that time?\n Myself only. Back then it was exactly what the name implies. The first contributor appeared six months after.\n When was Minetest first available to public?\n It was first published to a private IRC channel for testing, and after about a week I published it on a public programming channel on called #ohjelmointiputka. I created the website sometime during January 2011.\n How were the initial few months for the game? How did the userbase respond? How was it received?\n The initial userbase was mostly a bunch of hobbyist programmers from that IRC channel. Everyone liked messing around in the quirky little multiplayer that it was.\n How many core-developers are working on Minetest right now?\n I need to look this up as much as you do... Looks like we have 13 at the moment. It doesn't really correlate with how many people are working on Minetest though, as core developer is primarily a position of trust \u2014 they decide what is merged into the upstream repositories. Some contributors do a lot but aren't core developers. This goes both ways: Some core developers are quite inactive a lot of the time.\n Do these trusted core-developers have specific roles?\n They used to have, but [it] didn't work very well. Nowadays everyone is simply responsible of only touching things they know about.\n What are you learning from them and what are they learning from you?\n During the first years I learned a lot about programming. Some of it came from others but mostly it was just because I did it so much myself. Later I've learned some things about management as I had to move from programming more into a leadership role. Many young people have come and gone from the project as their life has moved on \u2014 I'm sure they've learned something from it.\n Tell us more about your workflow.\n Historically when making most of my development contribution in Minetest, or currently?\n Tell me about both the times, please.\n Well there's not much to talk about my current workflow, as I'm mainly doing and administration, being an encyclop\u00e6dia about the code and design of the project, assigning core developer, moderator and other roles to people, and just managing the odd weird things that sometimes happen that contributors and core developers can't handle.\nWhen I was programming Minetest in the first many years, and these days in other development projects, my workflow is just to allocate as much continuous time that I possibly can for a task that I want to do, then just begin designing and writing a prototype and iteratively forming it into a final implementation. The only distinct step in between starting and finishing is the first time it runs and does the bare minimum.\nI don't want to boast about it, but people have commented about my ability to solo develop things really fast from nothing into usable state. There's no method to it. I just make sure I have the time, I know what the bare minimum is and then I just get to it.\n Have there been any significant changes in the game or source code in the history of Minetest?\n It was developed in a very . We've never had to throw away any big parts. Maybe iterative isn't the best word, I mean it was always developed by building on what was previously created. Actually we've had one big change, although it too was an addition: When we went from version 0.3 to 0.4, Minetest gained its -based . It was a really big change in how people thought about and used Minetest.\n What are the different ways to participate?\n Many of our users like to write , big and small, and publish them on our forum and content database. If you're more of a person, our GitHub and channels are good places to check out. If you feel like a server administrator, you could set up a Minetest server with an interesting world for people to join in.\nIf you find something interesting in the game world while playing or experimenting, we have a popular screenshot thread on our forums that you can post to. It shows almost the entire history of the project and I still like browsing it. But I think the best part of Minetest is that it sets people free to do their own thing. You don't need to ask us or anyone to use Minetest for anything you would like. Use it to learn programming, use it as a teacher, use it to model an environment, geographical formations, a mathematical formula or an electronic principle, use it to prototype a multiplayer game. Use it as a way to host a party when in ? I think of it more of as a tool than a game project.\nBut you're welcome to contribute something that makes it better. It is a project at multiple levels, so pick a level that you're comfortable in.\n Can you give us some figures on Minetest?\n We don't really keep track of our userbase in any centralized manner, so I don't have any numbers to give unless I go about digging for them. It's difficult to figure out how many installs of Minetest there are when it's packaged in so many Linux distributions that I can't even count those reliably. There are also endless to be found, especially on mobile platforms, even though we do publish an official version.\n What are the tools you use for the development of Minetest?\n , and some common like , , . of course. Sometimes . Minetest uses the build system which is simple to use from the command-line. All in all just the bread and butter Linux command-line environment, with my personal customization of course.\nI don't really like complex slow IDEs [], they get in the way and create new problems that you shouldn't have to deal with.\n How do you track the progress of the development?\n Currently, or when I started the project? In any case the answer pretty much is I don't. Things develop as they do and nobody likes being pushed when they're doing it as a hobby for free. We use a release process where when enough new features have been added, there is a where only are allowed, and then a release. It's the bare minimum to keep things rolling smoothly in a large project like this. We have long wishlists and roadmaps, but in the end what features get developed gets chosen by whoever's putting in the work, as long as whatever they want to do fits the project.\nWell, we of course have an issue list and PR [] list on GitHub. I tend to take that for granted these days.\nThere are multiple levels you can track development in \u2014 issues and pull requests are at the bottom just above commits. You could be tracking roadmaps or minimum viable products or such, but we use a relatively chaotic model if you compare it to a company developing a product for a market.\n How rigorously is the software tested?\n There are for some easily testable portions, and there's a CI [] server that checks whether the project builds on a couple of platforms and whether the tests pass. In addition to developers many of our users are using the development version which helps us catch bugs before they end up in a release, making releases reasonably . How rigorously? Well, you could do more or less, but this seems to balance the effort and the end result.\n Have there ever been critical bugs in the releases, or severe security breaches?\n That depends on your criteria. Nothing that would've made the news. And nothing that I would really remember. Something allowing in-game cheating on a multiplayer server, sure. Something that would have irreversibly corrupted a player's game world, not in a stable release. Something that would have prevented the game from starting on some platform, sure of course. Something worthy of a remote code execution CVE []? Well not really, but that can be just because not enough resources are put into finding out if there are any. Not that we have any resources for that. Contributions welcome!\n What are the key selling points of Minetest? As I understand, Minetest is not just a game, and you can do more with it. What are some of the fascinating use cases you have seen people use Minetest for?\n It's so many things to so many people. The basic premise is, it implements a cubic world which is played in the or perspective, either locally or on a multiplayer server. In the default game there's a sandbox or a survival-ish scenario where you can build stuff from familiar materials, and a world generator that creates a natural landscape.\nBut hooks have been added to it where you can add or remove content to your liking (these pluggable modifications are called \"mods\" by the engine), and the community has used these over the years to create different kinds of above- and underground landscapes that can either be just explored or used as the backdrop for whatever you're doing, logical systems resembling electronics or mechanics, programmable blocks, sets of animals with different design goals, some vehicles (although the engine isn't quite up to snuff for those), trains, multiplayer economics, some RPG [] elements, weapons, things designed for education, and whatnot. Those are combined in multiplayer worlds on servers to something much more than the sums of their parts.\nAnd often the enjoyment is as much in the making of a mod as it is in using the end result. It's an outdated idea that you implement a feature to use it. Minetest can be enjoyed as much inside a text editor as it can be enjoyed by controlling the player character in the game. It's actually interesting also that the fact that it is a multiplayer sandbox environment makes it fun in itself due to human nature. I proved it with the initial versions that had like 3 block types and zero game elements or limits other than basic gravity. You get these layers of creativity: There's creativity in the making of Minetest, there's creativity in making a mod, there's creativity in making a world, there's creativity in the playing itself.\nIf you like messing around in open-ended development and gameplay, Minetest is for you. If you need an end goal and a set path, some specific mods or servers could give you those. I mean, one could write a book about this. It's the question Minetest asked that Minetest has been answering.\n What are the main features that differentiate Minetest from ?\n Minetest has a simple base game that might seem like the exact same thing. However, under the hood Minetest is open source, has a modding API, runs on older hardware, supports more platforms and is free to download. The community has released many kinds of games that run on Minetest and in fact the project is very much based on the community.\n Tell us more about Minetest's modding API.\n Technically the modding API is a Lua interpreter integrated into the Minetest engine, which runs Lua in an environment to which most of the game content and engine features are provided by the engine. There is a simple format for bundling code, textures, sounds and other data to form a thing called \"mod\". Users can install them and enable them for the game worlds they create.\nMods also create their own APIs that other mods can interface to, and the engine implements a dependency model to facilitate this. Some game content is grouped into groups so that handling similar items by mods that don't know about the specifics can handle them in reasonable ways. Say, if you add a new kind of tree formed from its special blocks, they can be marked as being wood or so, and then you can use them as fuel in most cooking or such devices no matter who created them.\nThere is a mechanism for bundling mods into modpacks to easily bundle related mods together, and there is a concept called \"game\" which is kind of a stand-alone modpack. The game Minetest comes with is just one of those, and if you install more, you can choose between them in the menu.\n Why was Lua chosen for the API? What are some of the advantages of using Lua?\n Lua is simple but effective, and designed for . It's also easy to sandbox. Not many languages actually are designed for embedding, and some of those aren't simple. For example, ['s] is complex and its API is changing all the time, and Python isn't really designed for embedding, it's more of a host language and messes with your locale settings and whatnot, and is quite slow.\nThere's also , which is a JIT [] compiled version of Lua. Minetest is able to use it and as such usually Minetest is built with it, as it's faster. Lua also has a track record in games, although that doesn't matter much in practice.\n What are some of the Minetest features that are extremely popular among the users?\n How do I know? Well, I mean, placing blocks probably, I'm pretty sure everyone does that. More seriously what Minetest does that Minecraft don't is that for the vast majority of servers you don't have to modify your client at all, regardless of mods used on the server. The client downloads what it needs from the server and custom code runs on the server. The user of course doesn't need to do anything to make this happen so everyone is automatically using it and it is quite a defining feature.\nModding, of course, is an extremely popular feature \u2014 Minetest wouldn't be what it is without mods. I'd say extremely popular is also the fact that Minetest's mobile versions use the same protocol and code as the desktop version. I don't think most users appreciate it, but some do. It brings you all the power regardless of the device.\nWell, one Minetest feature is definitely also the license, being LGPL [] 2.1. It has allowed many more and less appreciated developers to publish their own versions of it. This has happened on all the mobile app stores, those are full of Minetest forks with awful advertising and schemes. To me it's funny and definitely something that those shady developers appreciate, to users who have fallen for them it's probably quite painful.\n When was the last time you played Minecraft?\n I don't remember, certainly not once after 2014 as I don't have it on this computer. It quickly grew too slow on the previous computer on which I started developing Minetest. In the days [of Minecraft] it was capable of running on it, these days not a chance.\n What are some of the features in Minecraft that you hear about, which aren't currently in Minetest?\n I rarely hear about Minecraft and even then it's about some server and not about features. At one point every place was full of all kinds of Minecraft mods, but nowadays you have to go look for them to find them.\n Actually, what position do you hold in the Minetest development?\n For the past years I've been doing the positions that are the most difficult to fill for contributors: Being the \"CEO\" [Chief Executive Officer] of the project, and doing part of the web hosting, mostly the message board and overseeing the use of *.minetest.net subdomains. Basically just overseeing things and making sure things that people don't like to do don't turn into disasters. Sometimes I help with technical details of the engine that people don't always fully understand.\n What are some of the things you \"really\" like about your work?\n I like how robust Minetest is. It's based on proven technology that are kind of outdated, but that makes it easily compile and run almost anywhere, and as it's also free, it spreads and sticks like some goo. It's also small and low maintenance, which I like in anything I do.\nI also like that it explores what can be done in the game or application category it's in, in an unusual way (like outside the box of gameplay itself).\n Do you do this full-time? Or do you have any other job?\n Even though the first year or two things were quite hectic I've never done this full time. It doesn't really make any money.\n Ah, so you do have other job, too, right?\n Yeah, I've had a number of jobs during this time.\n How does the game development receive financial support?\n I get some donations or \"tips\" as I like to call them, which generally cover the hosting costs of the website and not much more. Other than that, there has never been any money involved. In addition to myself some modders and developers also collect some miniscule amounts of donations.\nI guess development is mostly supported by being able to slap it onto your CV [] and get a better job that way. I guess it's a bit sad. Or for , of course.\n\"Hi, my hobby is taking over the world from Microsoft. What's yours?\" Well it's a bit of a joke of me introducing myself and Minetest. And the absolute craziness of doing it for no monetary gain at all.\n Yeah; but some sort of donation is needed for running the servers, hosting the wiki, and the , right?\n It's not required, but I'm fortunate enough to get enough donations to not [have] to pay them out of my own pocket.\n How does a typical day as the core-developer look like?\n The core-developer?\n Since you are one of the core-developers of the game, how does your typical day as the core-developer of this open-source game look like?\n Currently, as I'm focusing on some other programming projects outside of Minetest, when I have some free time I still check the Minetest IRC channels and GitHub to see what's going on, and if I have something to say I'll make a comment about it. Of course I check my emails to see if any automated system has sent me a warning about something and needs fixing, or maybe there's a private message on the forum about some administrative task that needs doing. I might check some system statistics on the VPS [] running the forum to make sure it's running smoothly and make sure backups look ok.\nThe average core developer of course doesn't have much of these administrative things to do and can focus on some programming task or just check through pull requests to see if a new contribution needs attention. For most core developers the typical day is probably a day off, though, as we work on Minetest when we have free time and feel like it.\n Tell me, what are some of the design decisions that you are not happy about?\n There are none, all of them were required to get where we are now. I think you should never blame a design decision that got you somewhere.\n Okay. How does the developer team decide on the design-decisions and feature requests for the game?\n I have written some blog posts and roadmaps about my vision, and the team is free to either pick from there or simply do anything they think is important. The core team mostly deals with engine things, and feature requests often come from modders. Dealing with game design feature requests is really difficult so we've tried to move them out of the engine and into the independent game content. Most features are accepted as long as they're simply and nicely done and it's obvious players or modders will find use for them.\nThe team will ask from me if they're unsure about something. It doesn't often happen, but they're free to do it and I take the responsibility in that case.\nThis also applies if there's a conflict between team members.\n Conflict between the team members? How often is there a conflict between team members? And how do you resolve it?\n I'm not sure it has ever really happened. It's not as exciting as it sounds. But in that case I get to be the dictator. :-)\n What accomplishment are you most proud of?\n I think it's the initial decision to start the project. Everything is based on that, after all. Maybe also the fact that probably like 50% of Minecraft clones on Google Play are Minetest forks, many of which are at least slightly illegal.\n Looking back at the 9\u201310 years of this project, what are some of the excellent moments/milestones that stand out?\n The initial 0.4 development in late 2011 and early 2012 was an exciting time. One of the contributors at the time helped me a lot in getting it done, he was quite capable and enjoyable to work with. It felt a bit like a \"dream team\". Some persons in the Minetest team are quite anonymous, including this one \u2014 I never learned their real life identity.\nThere was a take over attempt of the project in 2017 by an individual who until then seemed like a contributor with good intentions. It was quite the time too. I don't want to give any publicity to him though, as he's still trying to do it. I don't know if I'd call it excellent, but it definitely comes to mind as something that happened.\nDuring the past few years Minetest has had some physical presence in Europe. A couple of core developers and community members organized a stall at the #live event in 2017 and 2018.\nI guess I have to say I'm not that good at remembering milestones though. I'm sure many people have their own memories about Minetest's history. Many remember their first server that they played on, for example \u2014 my perspective on the other hand is in development. In development, it's a good thing I don't remember much because that means everything has gone rather smoothly.\n Have you been to Freenode #live events?\n I haven't been to Freenode #live. I don't tend to travel that far, I feel international travel is too much hassle and I'm not a very social person at all.\n Do you or any of the Minetest developers attend , or other conferences too?\n I haven't been following too closely, but as they're open source developers and many live in , you might stumble upon them in events around there. They might be in a disguise, though, as they are involved in other projects in addition to Minetest.\nRubenwardy (one of the core developers) has said he wants a Minetest convention and I have to go. We'll see if that happens, and where if so.\n Ah, that would be interesting. Does Rubenwardy have any places in mind? What do you think of organising it in Helsinki?\n As most core developers and contributors come from Germany, France, UK and such, I think Helsinki wouldn't make that much sense.\nDuring Minetest's history, there haven't been almost any Finnish developers other than me. And, given that I live half a thousand kilometers away from Helsinki, it's not exactly my home town either.\nIt's a very international project.\n How do you and Minetest benefit from the presence at freenode? Apart from the platform features, do you also benefit from links with members of other channels at Freenode?\n Freenode doesn't really link projects together, it mostly works as a private platform for discussions for each project. Of course it's easy to join if you're already on some other Freenode channels, as many open source developers are.\n Apart from freenode, how do the developers meet with other developers? Do they use online text or video chat, or do they also have meet-ups in-person?\n I hear people using mostly IRC, Github and the forum. There's some development talk on the unofficial server too. I rarely hear about IRL meet-ups. I've only ever met one Minetest contributor who was visiting with a group to see the which happens this time of the year here in the north.\n What is planned for the next versions?\n I and many of our core developers have big plans but we're a bit lazy and have many projects going on so it's really up to who has a spare week here and there and what kind of new contributions are coming in. We have a history of not ending up even close to what the roadmap was telling us to do. On a weekly basis we do have a continuous flow of fixes and new modding API features going into the engine, so there's always something around the corner. In addition to that, an interesting place to be on the lookout is the modding sections of our forum. Those guys get to use much more imagination than the core engine developers. It's been long in the plans to get more imaginative content into the main Minetest release, but currently it's still kind of boring, so make sure [to] check out the forum and content database.\n What are some of the upcoming milestones for Minetest?\n We're moving release by release and including stuff on a when-it's-ready basis. [Version] 5.3 will be coming out very soon as there are just some bugs left. It's ended up with 50 commits. That's mostly bugfixes, but to pick a feature, the \"minimal development test\" game that comes with engine for mod and engine developing purposes has been rethought and overhauled. What'll end up in 5.4 is still completely open.\nIn my experience setting any milestones you're not doing yourself is never a good idea in a hobby project \u2014 it'll just intimidate people and nothing gets done. Some developers have big plans, including myself, but they may or may not happen. :-)\n How is the [internationalisation] support for Minetest? Do you plan on supporting more languages?\n There are some challenges due to the fact that Minetest supports multiplayer servers with each client using their own language settings, but if you choose your mods carefully, you can get a single player experience in many, many languages. You can check out the translation status for different languages at . You can also contribute translations right there on that website. We occasionally update the English versions and occasionally copy the translated texts over to the project to be included in releases.\nMany open source projects do it like this, we're no different. Currently it looks like 11 languages have 90% of texts translated. More than 90%, I mean.\nOf course with game content, especially that which you find separately, your mileage will vary \u2014 but the engine translations are enough to configure Minetest and get you into a game world. It's an ongoing process to try to make everything we can translatable by the community.\n Okay. Do you also plan on providing more biomes, or making the current ones more interesting?\n We've long been in the process of moving the game content out of the engine and away from the core team more to individual game-focused developers, so the default game content has been a bit boring. However, you don't need to live with it, as it's easily solved: just download some biomes you like into your game. At this point it's not really even intended to be used as-is.\nIt's the core idea of Minetest 0.4, and from there on all subsequent versions. Content is so easy to add and modify that it doesn't really even matter what content you start from.\nIf you want a fleshed out product with everything in there out of the box, Minetest doesn't really do that. But you can search on our forums or content database if there's something that would do it for you \u2014 some game packages are quite complete.\n What are some of the reasons people choose Minecraft over Minetest? What are some of the common complaints you hear about the game?\n I think most of the time people don't like Minetest because they want a full game that they can just play. On the other hand other people choose Minetest because they don't want that, they want something they can easily customize.\nSome don't like how Minetest looks, to the experienced eye the graphics aren't as polished. However it does run on older hardware. People using older hardware often choose Minetest because it works much better. On the other hand, Minetest can't utilize high end gaming PCs as well, it's not optimized for those.\nOf course also the price differentiates the two. Minecraft costs a lot, especially if you're a kid in a poor country, or you want to install it on every computer in the classroom, or even an entire school. But for the money you're getting a fleshed out product. For some use cases you can't beat that.\n Will the improvement in the graphics of the game compromise with the advantage of the game running on older hardware? Is it possible to achieve both without any compromises?\n Improvement in graphics will compromise the advantage of being able to run on old hardware, or it will result in basically two separate rendering engines. To take advantage of new hardware you have to switch to newer versions of , heavily use shaders and such, and as a result old hardware simply grinds to a halt or simply doesn't support those.\nOf course some improvement can be done without compromise, but it's relatively minor if you look at what gamers are expecting these days. On the other hand for use by kids or education or such, looks don't really matter. What matters is that it's able to run on the hardware they happen to have.\n Would you want to create two different engines for those players who have new hardware and want to enjoy the open-source game?\n Maybe, but I'm not the one to do it. High-end graphics is quite a specialized field and it's especially specialized when you want to render a voxel world like this, with voxel-based lighting and whatnot. For more common types of game environments you could use more easy-to-use solutions.\n What contributors are the most wanted at the moment? What activities are in dire need of more eyeballs and helping hands?\n Any kind of contribution is always welcome. I don't think I'm in a position to pick and choose what people spend their time on. If you contribute something because it's important to you, it's going to be important to some others too. I also can't pick and choose what skills people have. If you are a capable programmer and for some crazy reason have lots of free time that you don't know what to do with, you can absolutely trust me and other core developers to give you things to do for the rest of your life. But that's not how it works, nobody is like that. You do what you like and what you feel is important. You will be thanked by the users.\nOn the off chance that I can get a programmer inspired to do something for us: We've been long thinking of Voxel Area Entities \u2014 basically objects that are built from the same blocks that the world is, but that can move within the world based on some kind of moddable logic, like physics. Every year I'm asked by a different person when I'm going to do it, and every year I've had some other project I'm focusing on. Most core developers don't feel they have what it takes to even try doing that.\nOther massive ideas floating in the air in the Minetest developer community, core developers and contributors alike, is abstracting away and switching the rendering engine to something more modern, probably something made by us to fit the needs of Minetest instead of some generic game graphics engine.\n For how long do you see yourself continuing to work as the CEO of the project?\n Until I'm dead, probably. Not because I really want to, but because it's not something anyone else wants to do.\nWhat would you choose, going on the beach, pub or golf field to take it easy, or staying in your basement looking through issues and pull requests, thinking when you're going to upgrade the forum software, trying to figure out why something was implemented in some way in the code, writing about some idea you have that hasn't still been implemented in seven years?\nSee, I'm absolutely crazy. Most people aren't.\nIt's actually an interesting question: Is there any way I could be replaced?\n Is there a way to?\n I do think some parts of Minetest have been made as student projects. Such extra motivation helps getting things done. Maybe a tech leadership school could take Minetest CEO as a student project position? Like, do it for a year and get lots of points. Just an idea I guess.\nAlso, I kind of hate the subject. In that way I'm more of a CTO [Chief Technical Officer] than a CEO.\n Do you think Minetest can benefit from programmes such as Google Summer of Code?\n Maybe, but it's difficult to compete with other projects there and the person doing it has to already be a contributor with a task in mind. Otherwise it takes way too much prepping work to get somebody going in anything larger. Self motivation is key in getting something done in a project like this.\nNobody will make you do anything or guide you. You have to want to do it, and ask for help. We also don't have any centralized official organization in any country, so we can't really collect funds and pay people to do things.\nMoney, official forms, agreements \u2014 No thanks. Throw it in the trash. Our agreement is the LGPL license of the code and of other assets \u2014 it's the bare minimum and works.\nEnrolling Minetest into could be the contribution of someone. I don't think there's anything stopping that. It could be quite beneficial to the project.\n How can the community ensure that the Minetest project succeeds for the foreseeable future?\n Use it, teach other people how to use it, share your in-game and mod creations with other people. Of course reporting and fixing bugs and contributing engine features helps, but the main reason it exists is because it has users that enjoy playing it.\nWhether something is a \"thing\" really only depends on whether it's popular.\n When did you actually think Minetest was getting significant attention and it was getting popular?'\n When I started posting about it on the Irrlicht forums and other places on the 'net, it immediately became obvious there was interest for such a thing. I mean, compared to Minecraft, it has always been tiny. But it was something completely different to anything else I had published until then in terms of public interest. It wasn't just one person saying they checked it out. It easily created a thread with people arguing whether it was even legal to make one like it.\n The legal aspect is something even I wondered about. But you haven't received any legal notices, right?\n Well, it might have not been obvious then that it is legal, but nowadays there are so many Minecraft-like games everywhere people don't even think about it any more. Nothing at all, ever.\nAnd why would I [get a legal notice?] \u2014 it's completely made from scratch and I've never seen any Minecraft source code. That wouldn't be the reason I'd change the name. But changing the name isn't really doable. You could of course publish it in addition under a second name and leave the engine called Minetest. But what's the point?\nMinetest is such a bad name it works as a trademark in itself. Nobody wants to copy it. It doesn't sell, but we don't need to sell. If it was a serious commercial endeavour I would never had named it that in the first place. [A trademark lawsuit would] only make Minetest grossly more popular, and we could simply change the name. Really nothing is stopping us, if we need to, but there's not really any need.\n What are some of your other hobbies?\n In addition to programming I also do electronics as a hobby. I'm very interested in electric vehicle [EV] conversions and have done some reverse engineering for re-using parts from crashed EVs. Some of that has been released as open source. Well, in addition to having them as hobbies, I also work in programming and electronics. But anyway \u2014 whether money is involved or not, that's what I do.\nI've also tried to do some other game development. That was more of a learning experience than something that would have resulted in an end product.\n What sport activities do you normally undertake to stay strong and healthy? How has the pandemic affected them?\n I'm not a very sporty person. If I feel so, I'll go for a walk or ride to town and back with my bicycle. I do try to eat quite healthy though. The pandemic hasn't had much effect on my life overall. I've just shifted from less remote work to more remote work.\n What are some of the important things your have learned as an open-source game developer?\n Well, most game ideas suck, and the programming doesn't really matter. Game development isn't something I'd recommend for anyone, it's such a saturated field.\n Saturated field?\n I mean, too many people are making games already. It's such a popular hobby.\n Well those were all the questions I had for you.\n (That was quite a lot of questions, I think that'd make a small book so far. :-))\n Anything you would like to add?\n I don't think so.\n Thank you so much, being so generous with your time, celeron55. It was wonderful discussing about Minetest with you!\n No problem, it's not too often I answer so much things about my longest ever project."}

It features original material compiled throughout the previous month after an overview of the month's biggest stories.\nThis month's spotlight on the campaign trail includes interviews with the vice presidential nominees of the Prohibition Party, Reform Party, and the Life and Liberty Party.\nSummary.\nAs the campaign entered June, presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden, who mathematically secured the nomination of his party with victories in the June 2 primaries, led President Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, 49.0 percent to 42.2 percent in the average.\n related to the death of continued across the nation.

He received criticism for the move. Protests escalated later in June with the police in Atlanta. Charges were promptly filed against the officers involved. Atlanta's Democratic mayor 's handling of the incident raised her vice presidential prospects. With the issue of race at the forefront of the campaign, Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota withdrew her name from consideration to be Biden's running mate. She endorsed the selection of a \"woman of color.\" At the time, Bottoms, former , Congresswoman , \u00a0New Mexico , and Senators Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren were said to be finalists for the .\nAlso as a result of the protests, the slogan \"\" became popular among supporters of Black Lives Matter. The Minneapolis voted to disband its police force. And in some cities, most notably in Seattle, protesters set up police-free autonomous zones. CHAZ () or CHOP (Capitol Hill Occupied Protests) as it was later known, formed in Seattle's Capitol Hill neighborhood. The Trump campaign connected the \"defund\" slogan and lawlessness to Biden. In addition, rioters started to tear down and vandalize public statues. They vandalized, toppled, and/or destroyed statues of figures associated with the , and statues of , US presidents and , and abolitionist . Law enforcement halted attempts to take down an equestrial statue of US President in Lafayette Square. Ahead of a planned attempt to take down the featuring US President in , Trump vowed to issue an executive order regarding those caught desecrating federal statues. Trump railed against the rioters during his first campaign rally since the coronavirus pandemic fully engaged the United States, on June 20 in Tulsa, Oklahoma. The rally did not require , which led to criticism over concerns about spreading coronavirus. Attendance was underwhelming with empty seats visible. Trump created controversy during the rally with a statement about coronavirus testing resulting in an uptick in the number of infections counted. Although the rate of deaths from coronavirus decreased, infections increased in certain states, resulting in a slowdown in reopening. Due to the pandemic, the planned moved from to Jacksonville.

The administration sued to stop publication, claiming the book had not yet been fully checked for classified information. A judge agreed the book may have contained classified materials but ruled that \"the damage is done\" with advanced copies made available to the media. Notably, in the book, Bolton claims Trump asked Chinese paramount leader Xi Jinping for help in the 2020 election, which Trump denied. Trump said Bolton broke the law and \"likes dropping bombs on people, and killing them.\" Democrats expressed dissatisfaction with Bolton over his unwillingness to testify at the Trump impeachment proceedings. In interviews promoting the book, Bolton said he would not vote for Trump or Biden but planned to write-in an alternate candidate instead. In alternate party news, businessman Rocky De La Fuente, already the presidential nominee of the , was named the presidential nominee of both the Reform Party and the of Michigan. The parties nominated his running mate, historian Darcy Richardson, for vice president. The newly created Life and Liberty Party, a -leaning party, held its first national convention and nominated a ticket of activist J. R. Myers for president and professor Tiara Lusk for vice president.In the Green Party, union leader and party co-founder attained the number of delegates required to secure the Green Party presidential nomination ahead of the party's in July.\nAt the end of the month, Biden held his first press conference since the pandemic was just starting in the United States. At the event, he broached the \"New York Times\" report that Russians were paying bounties to the Taliban to kill American soldiers in Afghanistan.Trump described the story as possibly a hoax and the White House claimed it did not brief Trump on the matter. Biden, during his conference, also countered claims about his mental acuity, declaring that he \"can hardly wait to compare my cognitive capability to the cognitive capability of the man I'm running against.\" Nevertheless, with more in June including the misstatement that 120 million people had died from coronavirus, opposition questions about Biden's alleged mental decline continued. A poll showed 55 percent of respondents believed Biden to be in the early stages of . Still, he remained well ahead of Trump in opinion polls as the month came to a close.

However, the Prohibition Party has access in Mississippi and Arkansas and is attempting to appear on the ballot in Vermont, Colorado, and Tennessee. In addition, Collins won the American Independent Party's California Primary in March. Their victory does not guarantee Collins/Parker the party's nomination and a place on the California ballot. The Prohibition Party has not attained ballot access in five or more states since . \u00a0In 2016, the party's ticket of James Hedges for President and Bill Bayes for Vice President appeared on the ballot in three states and received 5,617 votes. \nCollins/Parker was not the Prohibition Party's original 2020 presidential ticket. In November 2018, the party nominated a ticket of Bayes for President and C.L. Gammon for Vice President. Bayes withdrew in March 2019. The next month, the party nominated a new ticket of Gammon for President and Collins for Vice President. Gammon withdrew due to health reasons around the beginning of August 2019.

Three days later, the ballot- qualified Natural Law Party of Michigan gave its nomination to the duo. De La Fuente/Richardson has already secured the nomination of the Alliance Party, giving it ballot access in Delaware, South Carolina, and possibly Connecticut. Wikinews reached out to Richardson to discuss the campaign.\nRichardson is a political activist and historian who has authored many books on past political campaigns. He owns the political website \"Uncovered Politics\". In the , Richardson served as campaign manager for the late US Senator . Richardson himself entered presidential politics when he challenged President Barack Obama for the Democratic Party's 2012 presidential nomination. He sought the Reform Party's 2016 presidential nomination but lost to his 2020 running mate De La Fuente. In 2018, Richardson for as the Reform Party nominee and finished in third place. \nWith Wikinews, Richardson discussed his role as the running mate of De La Fuente, the complexity of being the vice presidential nominee for so many parties simultaneously, and for what the De La Fuente/Richardson ticket stands.\n What are your duties and responsibilities as the running mate of Rocky De La Fuente?\n De La Fuente/Richardson is the ticket of the Alliance, Reform, Natural Law, and American Delta parties. What can the De La Fuente campaign do to grow these parties? Is the campaign focused more on growing one party over the others?\n What does the De La Fuente/Richardson ticket stand for? What unique issues or ideas should a voter associate with the campaign?\nTiara Lusk (Life and Liberty Party).\nOn June 27, via , the Life and Liberty Party (L&amp;L) held its first national convention. It nominated conservative activist J. R. Myers of Alaska for president. For vice president, three candidates sought the party's nomination. With 71 percent of the vote, Tiara Lusk of Idaho was victorious. Wikinews contacted Lusk about her designation as the first vice presidential nominee of the Life and Liberty Party.\nLusk teaches business management as an adjunct professor at . She served as a delegate at the 's 2018 convention and as a delegate at the Constitution Party's . In addition, she chaired region six of the Constitution Party of Idaho. \nThe Life and Liberty Party formed from former members of the Constitution Party. It has attained ballot access in Arkansas and is currently petitioning in several other states. As of late June, several state Constitution parties were considering severing their ties with the national Constitution Party, which nominated Don Blankenship for president in May. According to Politics1.com, some of these states may attempt to give their nomination and ballot access to the Myers/Lusk ticket. \nWith Wikinews, Lusk discussed why she joined the Life and Liberty Party, what her role as vice presidential nominee entails, and why voters should choose the Myers/Lusk ticket over other conservative tickets.\n What is the Life and Liberty Party? How is it different from the Constitution Party? And why did you decide to seek its vice presidential nomination?\n What are your duties and responsibilities as the vice presidential nominee of the Life and Liberty Party?\n Why should right wing or conservative voters choose Myers/Lusk over President Trump or the Constitution Party's Blankenship/Mohr ticket?"}

It features original material compiled throughout the previous month after an overview of the month's biggest stories.\nThis month's spotlight on the campaign trail includes interviews with the vice presidential nominees of the , the Bread and Roses Party, and the Unity Party of America.\nSummary.\nAs the campaign reached July, presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden led incumbent President Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, in the head-to-head polling average, 49.7 percent to 40.3 percent.\nOn July 1, the city of Seattle cleared the autonomous (Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone/Capitol Hill Organized Protest). Nevertheless, civil unrest including the toppling of statues, still stemming from the police killing of in May, continued elsewhere in the US. President Trump sent officers to protect federal buildings in Portland. Biden criticized the move, arguing Trump was \"sow[ing] chaos and division\" and \"mak[ing] matters worse.\" The Trump campaign accused Biden of \"siding with criminals.\" Trump maintained the campaign theme of . While the nation continued to suffer through the coronavirus pandemic, the President traveled to South Dakota, which, unlike most states, had not enacted a , to take part in a celebration at on the eve of . He delivered a speech in which he condemned rioters who desecrate statues and memorials throughout the nation. In addition, he announced the creation of a special park with statues to honor historic US figures. Most attendees at the event did not practice or wear . The next day, Trump held a Fourth of July \"Salute to America\" in Washington, D.C. in which he delivered another speech. Joe Biden forewent traditional holiday activities as an added precaution against COVID-19. That same day, rapper made a surprise announcement on Twitter that he, himself, was running for president. In an interview with \"\", West outlined his campaign. He named Wyoming preacher as his running mate and introduced the Birthday Party as the vehicle for his run. His platform included . West backed away from his previous support for President Trump, expressing disappointment at reports Trump hid in the White House basement during riots. He leveled greater criticism at Biden, saying he was not \"special\" like himself, Trump, and former presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton. The interviewer questioned whether West was running to help President Trump defeat Biden. West did not deny the suggestion. After the interview, a spokesman for West claimed West decided to drop out of the race. However, subsequently, West officially filed with the FEC and secured a place on the ballot in Oklahoma with a US$35,000 payment. Two other Independent presidential candidates also paid the fee to qualify for the Oklahoma ballot: child actor and entrepreneur ; plus pianist and pageant participant . West, in an interview with a radio station, floated Simmons as a potential running mate, arguing Tidball could be used in a different capacity. He identified fellow rapper as his ideal running mate. West held his first campaign rally in Charleston, where he tearfully discussed potentially aborting his first child with wife , screaming \"I almost killed my daughter!\" He proposed a US$1 million payment for those who give birth to children rather than aborting. At this time, West's family reportedly expressed concerns about West's mental state. The next day on Twitter West accused his wife of attempting to \"lock me up\" due to his comments at the rally.\nIn a July 9 speech in Pennsylvania, Biden introduced an economic plan called \"Build Back Better\" designed to reinvigorate the US economy in the aftermath of the coronavirus pandemic. \"Build Back Better\" is, like Trump's \"\" plan, a form of . \"Build Back Better\" calls for an increase in corporate taxes among economic incentives to \"Buy American.\" Biden claimed the plan would create five million US jobs. Trump encouraged public schools to reopen classes in-person at summer's end. He threatened to withhold federal funds from districts that did not comply. Trump later softened his stance, acknowledging that circumstances may require delaying some school reopenings. In addition, for the first time, Trump was pictured wearing a face mask. As cases of coronavirus increased in Florida, Trump cancelled the in-person planned for Jacksonville. Instead, like the Republicans opted to hold their convention in a largely virtual format. The Libertarian Party held the second half of its partially in-person in Orlando. Although the party had already nominated the ticket of professor for president and podcaster for vice president at the virtual convention in May, party business still needed to be completed. At the same time, the Green Party held its national convention virtually and nominated the ticket of party co-founder and union leader for president and truck driver for vice president. \u00a0 \nIn mid-July, Trump commuted the prison sentence of confidante Roger Stone. Stone had been found guilty of several crimes including false statements to investigators as part of 's of Russian interference into the 2016 presidential election. Trump called Stone's 40 month sentence \"unjust.\" The Biden campaign criticized the commutation as an abuse of power, pointing to the \"ballot box\" as the only way to stop Trump. Several days later, Trump's niece released the tell-all book \"\". The book alleges, among other things, that Trump paid his friend Joe Shapiro to take the for him before his admission to the . Shapiro's widow, former tennis player , said her husband had told her Trump had not met Shapiro until being admitted to Wharton. The July 17 death of Democratic Congressman , a prominent civil rights leader, had a major impact on the second half of the month. The death brought the issue of civil rights back to the forefront of the campaign. Lewis's colleague and leader of the , Congresswoman emerged as a significant contender to be Biden's running mate, joining Senators Kamala Harris, Elizabeth Warren, and as potential candidates. Trump did not attend Lewis's viewing or funeral. Three former presidents including Barack Obama attended the funeral. During his eulogy, Obama took a veiled shot at Trump for his attacks on , which critics, like Obama, have said amounted to voter suppression. As the funeral progressed, Trump tweeted about possibly delaying the 2020 election due to his concerns about potential fraud from widespread mail-in balloting instituted due to the pandemic. Biden attacked Trump for the tweet, claiming he used it to distract from Lewis's funeral. In honor of Lewis, Biden said once in office he would immediately sign the renewal of the , renamed the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Act. On the day of the funeral, the co-chair of Black Voices for Trump and 2012 presidential candidate, Herman Cain, who, like Trump, ran for president on his business credentials, died from COVID-19. He had attended Trump's Tulsa rally in June without a mask and first received hospital treatment for COVID-19 on July 1. Trump lauded Cain as a \"powerful voice of freedom.\" \nAs July came to a close, Biden\u2019s lead over Trump in the RealClearPolitics average slightly decreased, with Biden registering 49.9 percent to 42.1 percent for Trump. \nSpotlight.\nAmar Patel (American Solidarity Party).\nIn July, the 's ticket of retired teacher for president and high school teacher Amar Patel for vice president, qualified, through petition, for ballot access in Illinois.

DeJoy maintained the USPS could handle the increased demand for mail-in ballots amid the coronavirus pandemic. Democrats in Congress pushed for extra funding to avoid potential voter disenfranchisement. Trump endorsed blocking emergency relief as a means to prevent a proliferation of mail-in ballots. Biden criticized Trump for this stance, arguing the President did not want the election to take place. Trump repeated his claim mail-in voting would be fraudulent. In addition,\u00a0he initiated several lawsuits challenging certain states' mail-in voting procedures, particularly a Nevada law mandating ballots be mailed to all registered voters.\nBiden named Senator Kamala Harris of California as his running mate.

Trump questioned the selection. He said the \"phony\" and \"nasty\" Harris attacked Biden during Democratic debates and blasted her behavior during the Supreme Court . He also said Harris' poll numbers dropped precipitously before her withdrawal. Other critics outside the Democratic party raised questions about Harris' eligibility, which Trump also briefly entertained. Commentators compared this response to the debunked that questioned the citizenship of President Barack Obama. One entity whose members challenged Obama's citizenship and now do likewise with Harris, the American Independent Party, nominated a ticket of presidential nominee Rocky De La Fuente for president and rapper for vice president. The party, which has ballot access in California, reportedly did not contact West about the nomination. West, a presidential candidate himself, with the Birthday Party, spent much of August seeking ballot access in various states. According to \"\", West claimed to be in communication with Trump's son-in-law and White House adviser \"almost daily.\" In mid-August, Kushner, on behalf of the White House, helped broker a deal establishing diplomatic relations between Israel and the United Arab Emirates.\nJust ahead of the , Donald Trump's younger brother died of an unspecified illness. Biden and Harris each sent their condolences to Trump. Observers questioned whether coronavirus was the cause of death. The hashtag #WrongTrump went viral on Twitter shortly after, suggesting users wished for the President's death. The Democratic convention took place in a largely virtual format due to the coronavirus pandemic. \u00a0It featured speeches that were, for the most part, previously recorded. Party business took place in , Wisconsin. Speakers hammered Trump for his response to coronavirus. Biden was officially nominated with some delegates pledged to Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who, unlike the other withdrawn Democratic candidates, did not release his delegates to Biden in order to help shape the party platform. At 77, Biden became the oldest person ever nominated for president by either major party. Speakers throughout the four day convention included three former presidents Jimmy Carter, Bill Clinton, and Obama; former Ohio John Kasich, among other Republicans; and two brothers of , whose death in police custody in May led to widespread protests. Former Michelle Obama gave the keynote address on the opening night, urging viewers, \"we have got to vote for Joe Biden like our lives depend on it.\" After her speech, the slur \"Big Mike\" trended on Twitter. Harris, in her address, accepted the vice presidential nomination, becoming the first and first to fill the role. On the last day, Biden delivered his acceptance speech at in , Delaware. Broadcast of the speech appeared on a screen at a drive-in viewing nearby at . Trump described the convention as a \"-produced .\" He defended his record on the pandemic, and criticized Democrats for failing to mention Biden's opposition to Trump's from China and Europe to slow the spread of coronavirus. In a later speech, Trump assailed the event as the \"darkest and angriest and gloomiest convention in American history.\"\nOpinion polls did not show any meaningful convention bump for Biden.\nBefore the start of the , the police shooting of in , Wisconsin led to protests and unrest. Blake survived the shooting but was left paralyzed. Wisconsin declared a state of emergency and deployed the . Unrest continued in Portland, Oregon as well, where a Trump supporter was shot and killed. \"\" was a common theme at the convention. Most speeches were given from Washington D.C., though the party handled its internal business, such as the unanimous renomination of Trump, in , North Carolina. Trump and Vice President Mike Pence, both gave speeches in Charlotte on the first day of the convention. Other speakers during the four day event included four of Trump's children; First Lady Melania Trump; , who drew weapons on allegedly trespassing protesters at their St. Louis residence; and , a former high school student who received a settlement from CNN over the depiction of him during a 2019 anti-abortion march. From Israel, Mike Pompeo spoke, defending Trump's foreign policy. It was unusual for a sitting Secretary of State to speak to a political convention. Democrats in Congress vowed to investigate whether Pompeo used State Department resources to engage in partisan activities. Vice President Pence gave a speech before a crowd of about 100 people in Baltimore, Maryland. On the last night, Trump delivered a long acceptance speech on the South Lawn of the White House with 1,500 spectators and a large fireworks show afterwards. During the speech Trump claimed, \"Biden's plan is not a solution to the virus, but rather it is a surrender to the virus.\" Political commentators such as and described the speech as \"flat\" and lacking energy. Trump's decision to allow part of the convention to take place at the White House raised ethics questions as well. A Black Lives Matter group protested outside the White House on the last day of the convention. A group of protesters surrounded and allegedly threatened Senator and his wife as they exited the event. In reaction to the convention, Nancy Pelosi accused Trump of ignoring \"truth, evidence, data and facts\" and said she would prefer Biden not participate in the presidential debates with Trump. Biden rejected Pelosi's suggestion, saying he would act as a \"fact checker on the floor\" during the debate.\nUnlike Biden, Trump seemingly received a slight bump from his convention. At the end of August, he erased some of Biden's lead in the nationwide RealClearPolitics head to head average, trailing 49.6 percent to 43.3 percent.\nSpotlight.\nBat attacks LP nominee.\nFor Libertarian Party presidential nominee , the August campaign began on a hairy note. According to the campaign, on the morning of August 1 around 4:30 or 5:30 a.m. EST, a flying creature collided with Jorgensen on the front porch of her South Carolina home. That creature, a , apparently approached Jorgensen's neck and struck her on the chin. \"Wikinews\" contacted campaign manager and deputy campaign manager Jess Mears about the incident. \u00a0\n\"Jess Mears and I witnessed [the bat attack],\" said Dasbach to \"Wikinews\". \"I was driving them to the airport to catch a flight to Pittsburg[h].\"\nMears would not confirm Dasbach's account. Instead, she pointed to a video of Jorgensen on Facebook, which corroborated most of Dasbach's telling. Neither Dasbach nor Mears would provide \"Wikinews\" with an image of the wound.\nOn the campaign trail in Pittsburgh, Jorgensen stopped at a local medical facility. Jorgensen received five precautionary shots for since the bat broke her skin. Bats can carry the rabies virus, which is transmittable to humans and could result in death. According to the , treatment for any potential exposure requires a series of shots over a 14 day period. In her Facebook video, Jorgensen confirmed this course of treatment. \n\"I'm taking the instructions very seriously\", said Jorgensen. \"The instructions basically say if you miss any shots, if you don't take them on time, you die. They didn't say it quite like that. They said if you don't take the remaining shots on time then the shots you've taken will do you no good. So that's kind of scary. [...] It is a bit disconcerting to have an encounter with a bat.\"\nNews of the incident was not reported until after August 7 when Jorgensen tweeted about missing campaign events in Mississippi to get shots as part of her treatment. Following the tweet, ', ', ', \"Time Magazine\", ', ', and ', among others, published stories on the incident. A day after the news broke, the hashtag #LetHerSpeak, referring to Jorgensen's bid to be included in the Presidential Debates, trended on Twitter. \nAt the time of the news reports, Jorgensen polled at three percent nationwide in the / poll. She polled at two percent in the . This falls short of the 15 percent threshold for participation in the official debates put on by the .\nControversy in the AIP.\nThe American Independent Party (AIP), the same party that nominated the late Alabama for president in and future president Donald Trump in 2016, nominated a candidate with center left views for its 2020 presidential ticket. At its August 15 convention with around 20 virtual attendees, the party nominated Alliance Party presidential nominee Rocky De La Fuente for president and rapper for vice president. The AIP, which has ballot access in California, the most populous US state, made the nomination amid three points of controversy: De La Fuente's usual running mate, Darcy Richardson, was left off the ticket in favor of West; questions surround whether the AIP nominated the ticket to assist President Trump's re-election; and before the nomination, De La Fuente made several monetary transfers to the AIP vice chairman.\nDe La Fuente, a businessman who first ran for president in the 2016 Democratic primaries and was the Reform Party's 2016 presidential nominee, ran for president again this year; first as a challenger to President Trump in the Republican primaries, and then as the presidential nominee of the Alliance, Reform, and parties. For each of these parties, Richardson is De La Fuente's running mate. The De La Fuente/Richardson ticket has ballot access in a total of 15 states. But for California, with the AIP, West stands in Richardson's usual place. Richardson had his own opinion on the matter. He provided \"Wikinews\" with the text of a message he sent to AIP vice chairman Mark Seidenberg:\n\"Please let Rocky [De La Fuente] know that if he runs with the unstable, bi-polar Trump-loving Kanye West in California that I will withdraw as his vice-presidential running mate nationally.\nI've spent my entire adult life battling the duopoly and certainly DO NOT want my name associated with a candidacy that peripherally includes a Trump/GOP plant like the unhinged rapper ... [AIP co-founder] must be rolling over in his grave.\"\nRichardson has since reconciled with De La Fuente and remains \"fully committed\" to the campaign despite its new association with West. \nWest, who is running for president in multiple states, may not even be aware of the AIP nomination. He has, previusly, not denied allegations his candidacy is meant to assist President Trump but also not admitted it outright. The AIP is less discreet about its intentions. In comments at \"Ballot Access News\", AIP chairman Markham Robinson, whose Twitter bio includes the hashtags #MAGA and #TRUMP2020, writes:\n\"It\u2019s a long shot I\u2019ll grant you, but our ticket may draw enough votes that would otherwise go to Biden-Harris to give Trump-Pence a plurality. \nThink about it for a second, who would votes for our ticket? Well, there will be those [who] vote for it based on their love and/or admiration for Rocky or Ye (Kanye West). There may well be from the ranks of Republicans who will not vote for Trump, but are galled by [the] thought of voting for loathsome Progressives/Socialists like Biden-Harris. And there will be those who will vote for Rocky because of his name and roots. In fact our ticket may turn out to be the most popular protest vote receptacle ever.\" \nAccording to FEC records, De La Fuente's Rocky 101 LLC gave Seidenberg a total of US$10,000 over a series of five payments between December 2019 and April 2020. The reports use the description \"research services\" or leave the label blank. Seidenberg defended the payments in comments on \"\" and denied any allegation of quid pro quo:\n\"[T]he advance[s] received from Rocky [were] to cover hotels and travel expenses around California to run for House and/or Senate races. None [of the money] went to work on [the] race for President. [I] spent three days alone in March 2020 at Library looking up Texas Election Law. Most of the time was [spent] at the offices of the and Registrar of Voters in Kings, Kern, Fresno, and Tulare Count[ies] on Rocky['s] run for House of Representatives.\" \nWhen asked to clarify his association with Seidenberg and whether the payments influenced the AIP decision, De La Fuente gave a terse \"no.\" Robinson and Seidenberg were each contacted for this story as well but have not responded to inquiries as of this publication.\nReturn of the Birthers.\nProminent members of the aforementioned AIP, among others, question the citizenship and eligibility of Democratic vice presidential nominee Kamala Harris. Her selection as Joe Biden's running mate and ultimate nomination at the Democratic National Convention further highlighted these questions. Political commentators see similarities to the and eligibility of President Barack Obama from those termed Birthers. Nearly all legal experts consider the perspective of Birthers as incorrect, arguing there is no question about Harris' eligibility. Still, the vocal minority persists. \"Birther King\" Andy Martin, a lesser-known 2012 and 2016 presidential candidate, \"Wikinews\" interviewee, and former adjunct law professor, provided his own input on the Harris question.\nAt \"Ballot Access News\", AIP vice chairman Mark Seidenberg commented:\n\"[Kamala Harris is] Constitutionally ineligible to serve as VPOTUS (Vice President of the United States). At [her] birth her parents were from foreign\ncountries and not US citizens, viz., she is not a natural born citizen. Then she [grew] up in her formative years in Canada and graduated from a high school in Canada.\" \nHarris was born October 20, 1964 in , California to an Indian-born mother, the late , and a Jamaican-born father, . The two parents were married before Harris' birth but divorced in 1971. Neither were U.S. citizens at the time of Harris' birth. Harris moved to Montreal, Quebec, Canada with her mother and sister, , at the age of 12. She graduated from Quebec's in 1981 before returning to the United States to attend college.\nThe makes the qualifications of vice president the same as the qualifications of president. , Section 1 sets the citizenship qualification for president:\n\"No Person except a , or a Citizen of the United States, at the time of the Adoption of this Constitution, shall be eligible to the Office of President\".\nMartin argues that since the term \"natural born Citizen\" is not defined in the document, the meaning of the term at the time of its writing should prevail.\n\"Under commonly understood legal theory in 1789,\" writes Martin, \"a natural born citizen had both parents born in the United States. Being born yourself in the US made you a 'citizen.' But you were 'natural born,' and therefore eligible to serve as president, only if both of your parents had also been born in the US.\"\nMartin says the founders constructed this \"significant barrier\" to \"prevent foreigners from coming to the US and procreating a baby who would then be eligible for the presidency.\" He claims the founders were concerned \"a German Prince would come to America and father a child to establish Germanic hegemony of the new nation.\"\nThe states: \"all persons born [...] in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens.\" Martin does not consider such to have any effect on what constitutes natural born citizenship, seeing the two as distinct concepts.\nDiffering slightly in a \"Newsweek\" essay, Professor of writes that the term \"subject to\" in the 14th Amendment requires parents to be citizens subject to \"complete jurisdiction\" rather than mere \"partial jurisdiction\" as noncitizens.\nAIP chairman Markham Robinson reflects this view in \"Ballot Access News\" comments:\n\"It is the AIP position that while foreign tourists (or illegal immigrants) are IN US jurisdiction, they are not UNDER it, so the children born in the US of such parents do not in fact enjoy 'birthright citizenship.'\" \nEastman does not make a judgment on Harris, arguing that she needs to answer questions on the status of her parents at the time of her birth. He holds that if they were \"lawful permanent residents\" at Harris' birth then she meets the requirement. If they were only \"temporary visitors\" on student visas, she does not meet the requirement. \nFor Martin, it does not make much of a difference. While he believes Harris does not qualify as a natural born citizen under the 1789 view, he says court decisions made to challenge Obama's status have left the natural born citizen clause unenforceable.\n\"Harris can probably rest easy that despite the renewed debate\", Martin opines, \"she will not be blocked from taking the oath of office if she and Biden win.\"\nThe majority of legal experts reject the views Seidenberg, Martin, Robinson and Eastman espouse. \nProfessor of writes in a \"Newsweek\" essay that the term \"natural born citizen\" derived from the British \"natural born subjects\" which included all people born within the borders of the British empire. Moreover, he says the 14th Amendment phrase \"subject to\" referred primarily to children born to tribes. He concludes Harris meets the natural born citizen requirement. \nOthers dismissed the claims outright. , Dean of UC Berkeley School of Law called it \"a truly silly argument.\" Professor of asked whether Oakland was part of the US and then declared \"that's the full legal analysis.\""}

These are often occupied by either the Progressive \u2014 The LEFT () and the Conservative \u2014 the RIGHT (the Liberal Party).\nHowever, 21st Century Australia is much more culturally diverse. There are different ideals and social values. Australian[s] can not see themselves fit into either the LEFT or the RIGHT ideology online. The people of Australia is more comfortable with fit for purpose policies or CENTRE. The current system does not support a third centre party.\nIn fact, Australians have become more cynical about the two major parties (LEFT and RIGHT). They are well educated and well informed. They believe they can offer the government so much in input and suggestions. They want to have more say in the governing of [...] Australia.\nI have since come to the belief that direct vote or participating democracy is the key for the next stage of the country's evolution. This is [a] movement overseas in terms of direct vote or direct democracy.\nIn Australia, I believe introduction of direct voting needs to be [a] gradual process. Laws needs to be enacted to allow direct voting. But before this, the public and [sitting] government needs to see the benefit of direct democracy.\n What made you decide to run for the Melbourne City's Lord Mayor? Why do you think you should be the Melbourne's Mayor?\n In [the] 2020 Melbourne local government election, I was nominated for the Lord Mayor of Melbourne. I hope to use the election as a platform to seed public awareness on participating democracy.\nI advocated for the creation of a platform called Participate in Melbourne where the people can begin with submitting their issues/concerns, offer suggestions, hold public debate and send those conclusions to elected councillor to deliberate and vote. [I] hope once the benefits are known, the council will enact laws to allow direct vote.\nI have founded an organisation called eTranslate that has offices in different countries. Over the years, [I] have gained a considerable amount of business and life experiences which are important in public life.\nApart from my professional life, I have always engaged in community work. I have a passion to enter public office and serve the community in a larger capacity.\nI have always been active in politics. I was a member of the Australia Liberal Party and participated in a federal election.\nDuring my time in politics, [I] understood the inner workings of major parties and the Australian political system.\nMost importantly, I have lived in Melbourne since 2000 and understand the city intimately as a business operator and as a resident.\n [C]ould you please explain what are the powers of Melbourne's Lord Mayor?\n Unlike the City of London where its local government administer [Central Business District] and greater London, the City of Melbourne is divided in 76 areas and the only administer the Melbourne CBD and two surrounding residential areas, and .\nWhile the area Melbourne City Council administer is small, the Melbourne CBD (second only to Sydney) is the engine of Australia's Economy. So [while] the scope of power is limited, the policies are wide-ranging. The Lord Mayor of Melbourne is partly a ceremonial role and partly a directorship role. It is like the Chairman of a company. The CEO of the council has all the executive powers. But the mayor and the councillors are like the board of directors and the chairperson. The only difference is that this chairperson sets the agenda for the CEO to implement. The chairperson drafts the agenda based on the wishes of the people \u2014 the voters.\n Tell us about your team Zorin. Tell us about your partner Gricol Yang.\n As required by the . All candidates that contest for the seat of Lord Mayor and Deputy Lord Mayor must form a team for ease of identification.\nSo I choose Team Zorin as a name that represented me, Wayne Tseng \u2014 Lord Mayor Candidate and Gricol Yang \u2014 Deputy Lord Mayor Candidate.\nI chose Zorin because I also have another company called Zorin Industries which specialise in Robotics. The name will only last until the result of the election is known.\nGricol Yang obtained a degree in commerce and worked in the as a Commercial Banker.\n You ran in an election as a representative of the Liberal party in 2010 \u2014 why did you quit the party? What have you learned since leaving the Liberals?\n I quit the party so I can run as an independent in the council election. I am pursuing direct democracy which is not an element of the Australian Liberal Party platform.\nHowever, during the time as a member of the Liberal party, I have learnt so much about...\n Tell us about your company eTranslate.\n I founded the firm eTranslate which shares the same name as the USA firm eTranslate (but not related). We specialise in language expertise and language information technology. The firm has two arms \u2014 The technology arm focuses on services to help developers to create language variants of their software. The language/cultural services arm provides cultural communication services to local government. Australia is a lot of ethnic minorities speaking over 120 languages and over 80 cultures. We have offices across Australia and in selected countries.\nSome of our past achievements include:\nWe also won a number of awards for our innovations.\n In the Candidate Questionnaire and Answers, you had listed operating eTranslate has given you expertise in undertaking the role of Councillor. How? Can you please explain?\n As the firm grew, I spent more of [my] time in the cultural communication services arms. There I served as the principal consultant leading a team which delivered consultancy services to all three levels of government in Australia.\n[A] politician needs business and life experience so they can make decisions that address real business and life situations.\nSo I do believe after years of growing and operating a business in so many areas, I could be of a service to the city.\n What do you think of the current governance of Melbourne's Mayor?\n The current mayor, , entered mid-term when the previous mayor was outsed for allegation.\nI do appreciate the hard work Sally did to bridge the political divide in a council chamber she inherited. This year the pandemic has made her work even harder as for any other leaders. But what she fall short off is to stand up to the State Government (provincial government) which [has] restricted the city ability to take its own decisive action to better protect the city.\nShe is Labor aligned so she can not compromise too much of the Labor State Government reign. But a local government needs to be separate [from] State government so it can exercise its power to protect [its] constituents.\n Could you please [tell] us about the 'Precision Policies'?\n Team Zorin pledge to bring all Melbournians to the council chamber. We will deploy an online platform to let Melbournians participate in the running of the city. You can post issues in your area, submit your solutions, raise alerts about wrong doing, rate your councillors action and comment on council decisions. It's called Participating Democracy. We pledge not only [to] formulate policies for the majority, but also [to] formulate precise policies for the minority. We called this Precision Policies.\nYou see the majority rule in current democracy. If you are in the minority, you will not be in luck. Our participating democracy platform ensure[s] that the needs of everyone includ[ing] those in minority group are captured. The government should work harder to ensure there are policies that precisely addressed the needs of everyone including minority group. Thus Precision Policies.\n What are some of the things you can bring to [the] table if you were to be elected as the Lord Mayor?\n Many other candidates in the election only advocate big spending and relief in payment of taxes. Just like the that shaped the 20th century, COVID-19 is shaping our time and the city is ill prepared for the post COVID world. Our council processes and bureaucracies are still paper base, our revenue model is not flexible to enable rapid recovery and take advantage of new opportunity.\nMy strategy is to Re-open, Reset, Reform as part of Melbourne Recovery. There is a comprehensive plan for recovery in all sectors from business to residents. See attached document.\n What does Melbourne lack under Sally Capp's Mayorship which you plan on improving?\n Sally['s] current strategy is to spend to recovery. While this is necessary, fundamental reforms are needed.\nMy strategy is to Re-open, Reset, Reform as part of Melbourne Recovery.\nKey Reforms include:\nMake Melbourne a full digitally transformed city with intelligent systems.\nMelbourne needs an efficient platform to recover and to seize new opportunities. Some of our processes and bureaucracies are still paper base. The tech needed are already available and proven models of digitisation are easily accessible. We should move towards full digitisation plus installation of intelligent systems. In simple jargon, these intelligent systems can enable efficiency projects such as:\nThis new platform will be Melbourne \"Digital Railway\" to recovery.\nMake Melbourne the first to reform council rate calculation.\nPost COVID Melbourne will see many empty shops, office floors and rental apartments. This is in addition to the many heritage-listed and old CBD properties that are not rentable but incredibly valuable. The current council rate calculation which is based on property value will send these owners off the cliff.\nOur team advocate a fundamental change to how council rate is calculated \u2014 based on yield and property value. A property of high value that remains vacant can receive lower rate bill. This will give relief but also give incentive for the property to attract new tenants. For commercial property where the tenant pays for the outgoing, the reduced rate bill will help to attract new tenants and relief for the tenant to grow their business.\nThe same applies to heritage-listed properties and residential rental properties. The list of beneficiaries is long.\nMake Melbourne an active Jobweaver.\nIn some of candidates' campaigns have been alluded Job \u2014 Job \u2014 Jobs; unfortunately, reality is we know old industries including retail will not return the same number of jobs. So where will new jobs come from. Local government should enact policies and implement initiatives to attract new industries. While the federal government hands out Job Maker financial assistance, local government should implement \"Job Weaver\" initiatives to attract new industries.\nWhile one candidate stated he has attracted a billion-dollar project to Melbourne, little of this money trickles to small businesses and local workforce. Melbourne's well-educated workforce can attract industries such as Robotics, AI Systems, Smart Financial Services and Accreditation Services. The key to attract these new industries is the development of the e-engagement platform.\nAustralia [may] enter a new NATO style trade pack with US, Japan, India, and other friendly nations. With so many Indian students and professions in Australia, Melbourne can seize the opportunity to be the business and finance center to administer these new alliances. Again, an efficient digital e-engagement platform is the key to seize these opportunities.\n On Team Zorin's website, you wrote \"Melbourne is too precious to be used as a test lab for half-baked policies.\" What are some of the current policies that are under-serving the residents of Melbourne?\n There are many current policies that are not working and under serving. Here are two examples:\nThe Melbourne city council [...] advocate for more residential towers and approve[d] a lot which is under construction. But there are no essential services in these areas to service residents. Essential services such as doctor, dentist, child care, mental health services and women's health services are almost non-existent.\nHere is my advocacy: There is little on other candidates' platforms for Melbourne as Residential Precinct. There is a Chemist Warehouse in every block. But where to go when you are sick at night. Our team propose to attract essential services (such as 24 hours super-clinic) to service Melbourne residents including GPs, dentist, childcare, radiology, mental health, men's health, women's health and crisis management. We have over 50,000 students in Melbourne; however, they are not entitled to free medical at even with a medical insurance. Gary Morgan rightly said, young family will settle in CBD, but where do they send their children for childcare, early learning, kindergarten, primary and secondary schools. Schools will lift apartment resale value. New apartments are being approved but with little green space and essential services. This will be failed.\nMelbourne City council advocate to re-open business but there is not enough measure to make sure the premises are COVID safe.\nThis is my advocacy: Make Melbourne the first to install a city-level outbreak detection team.\nA hard COVID lesson learnt is that outbreak needs to be contain fast. COVID-19 will not be the last. There are also frequent gastro outbreaks. Our team propose Australia first city-level Rapid Response, Virus education / awareness, Outbreak Detection and Containment Team (jokingly called Bug Busters). While we may not like to mention it, China's city level Bug Busters are key for them to contain outbreaks.\nIn addition, we advocate installation of health check gates at shopping centers and places of high people concentration. These gates will not only measure temperatures but will have regularly updated features to detect other symptoms. Just like security check points, they will become part of the post-COVID world. They may be integrated as part of security and drug checks. (The technology is already in used overseas).\nThink again, this along with PPE when mandated and social distancing is the key to safe opening.\n On your website, you wrote \"Team Zorin pledges to bring all Melbournians to the council chamber\" \u2014 how do you plan to do that? How will this affect people of Melbourne? What technologies would you require to achieve that?\n The phrase bring all Melbournians to the council chamber is a metaphor. The reality is that all Melbournians will have their opportunity to submit their issues and their suggestions into the digital democracy platform. They can participate in virtual debate and trials. Those findings will be submitted to the council chamber for formal debate. Now even if the laws do not allow direct vote, the platform has online polls to allow the people to vote. The elected councillors can see the \"wish\" of the people and voted accordingly. Thus \u2014 \"Bring the Melbournians to the council chamber\".\nTo a number of Melbournians who have been so stressed and depressed, it will take sometime for them to appreciate the opportunity to have their say. At the same time, so many Melbournians are tired and fed up with the current mayor for the lack of real solutions and the state government errors and mistakes, they will look for alternatives.\nI believe instead of installing another leader who is not going to be any wiser or someone who just want[s to] offer sensationalism just to win power, this is the time where we open the pathway to collective governing. The direct democracy or participating democracy (depends on who is framing this concept) will allow Melbournians to work collectively, find out solutions, TRIAL solutions, hold [...] forum and see what really works and then tell their leader to consider these well-founded solutions.\nIt does not affect the people of Melbourne other than giving them a new avenue to seek their answers. It will put the elected official on notice that people demand more, want to take part in the process of governing. Also the demand for greater transparency.\nThere are emerging technologies for participating democracy.\nMiVote is one prominent technology using to enable secured voting. Since the model on how direct democracy is going to unfold, the technologies are catching up with the needs of the people.\nFor the first time in digital revolution, it is technology that is catching up with the people. In this case, it is the digital democracy platform trying to the catch up with the inspiration of the people. Other less sophisticated ones include with template UpVote.\n What do you think of one's right to privacy? Will the people of Melbourne have to compromise a part of their privacy to accommodate to your plans for the city?\n Australia has a very strong privacy protection law. By participating in the democracy platform, the people would not disclose much of their details other than:\n How would you ensure the digital platform you intend to deploy for residents to participate for the running of city is not misused? In what ways will you ensure only the residents of the city can use it? Will the platform use user's privacy respecting software?\n The model in which how this participating democracy works itself will also be debated. Of course, I will seed the initial model.\nThe initial model do not allow anonymous posts or vote. Every one [who] contributes must verify that they are registered voters against the voters roll in the election authority. The voting itself are base on block chain which is the most secure we now have.\nThe software will respect Australia privacy law.\n How do you plan to help those Melbournians who are in the economically weaker category?\n The homeless and people living below the poverty line are part of the Melbourne community. On policy, the council will rent back empty home to give temporary shelter to the homeless or reduce rental for those who are economically weaker.\n Statistics show number of crimes reported in various cities in Australia including Melbourne have increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. How do you plan on handling the COVID-19 pandemic? What policies would you introduce to reduce the rate of crimes in Melbourne?\n On my policy platform, we have advocate[d] for night safe zones, additional CCTV and patrols. We will work with the police department (run by the state government) to ensure they monitor the parts of the city that pose higher risks.\n Why do you think \"Melbourne is poised to be a world city by 2030\"? What are some of the things necessary for ensuring that comes true? What are some of the current barriers which may prevent that from happening? How would you remove those barriers?\n Australia is an island continent. It has the world largest , , and reserve[s]. It has the most agriculturally sound land. It has every geographical [feature] you can find [on] earth. There is enough land to support a population of 2 billion.\nMelbourne like Sydney is a business, administrative and cultural centre. Yet it does not have the financial burden of being the largest city in Australia.\nMelbourne can seize the opportunity to be administration centre of the new opportunities. From new opportunities comes [new] found wealth and city development.\nBut what is stopping the city is its old paper base bureaucracies. This is why I advocate full digital transformation of council processes and install new smart systems. I also advocate the development of a[n] e-engagement system which allow[s] new industries from overseas to quickly engage with the City of Melbourne.\n Tell us about \"Guided Governing\". How would that play out? Your campaign talks about Democracy 2.0. What are the things where democracy is currently failing? How do you plan to fix it?\n In the Democracy 1.0, the majority rules. If you are a minority, you[r] needs may not be addressed.\nMelbourne is so much more than those issues raised by the mayoral candidates. The recovery needs to include everyone, not just those whose needs are on the candidates' policy platform.\nMelbournians will no longer accept that if your needs are not on their agenda, [bad] luck try again in 4 years. A lot can happen in 4 years. One COVID-19 lesson is to address issues head on, fast and with well-founded solutions. We can see from Stage 4, there were mistakes \u2014 50 mistakes as the reported.\nWe understand politicians are human, there is a limit to how much they know \u2014 especially career politicians. Melbournians as a collective can offer so much. Take my extensive policies. In fact, the list is much longer. These are real issues submitted by people at the ground level including suggestions by the people on my mini digital democracy platform.\nFor example, when Sally advocated for the expansion to Southbank Boulevard and big events, residents in Southbank already unhappy at sound levels rejected this completely. They advocate that the council should enforce a quiet zone after 10pm at residential areas. This is on my platform.\nMelbournians can submit their observations of any failures. One election issue is the self-injecting room (I know it is the state government who put it there). While every candidate concedes having one near QVM [] and near residential towers is bad, no candidate mentioned that there are dealers hovering 150 meters away supplying the goods creating an epicentre of drug deals around the self-injecting room. Chinese students living in on reported this on my platform even if they are not voters.\nYou see citizen participating can also stop bad policy in its track, this is guided governing.\nMelbournians can offer topics/suggestions that the candidates don't see. As a collective they have a greater foresight. In my policy document, topics discussed include:\nThese potential ideas and virtual forum findings can be submitted to the council chamber for councillors to debate guided by the evidence presented. Of course the current laws do not allow citizens to directly vote on council decisions. But Melbournians can conduct their votes on online polls. The result will show the councillors in the chamber the wish of the people. If they do not vote reflecting the wish of the people, they will know their [fate] come next election.\nIf I was to be elected, I will take gradual steps to introduce a platform for participation and direct vote.\nMy plan is to expand \"Participate Melbourne \" to empower Melbournians to\nIt goes further:\n Why do you plan to make Melbourne Australia's capital?\n Melbourne was Australia capitol until 1927. Then it was moved to Canberra.\nThe do have rights. But their identity and their rights are either suppressed or not encouraged.\nI want to use Melbourne public space to be a place where the First Nations (Indigenous) people can hold their discussion forum. I want to have the map of their different tribes displayed in Town Hall.\nI also want a day where we have the Indigenous festival.\n You have plans to create a city level disease detection swat unit and to install temperate and health check gates \u2014 how much time would it take to do it all across Melbourne? How much resources and funds are you planning to put behind the disease prevention of the city?\n I am [not(?)] privy to council records. So I don't have all the tools to calculate. But because the area that Melbourne City Council is small. I can work out the budget. I may budget to be the same that the city is spending now controlling the outbreak.\n Your manifesto also mentions reviewing \"animal management plan\" \u2014 could you tell us more about it?\n Pets are not support[ed] and unwanted in City of Melbourne. The current animal management plan advocates if lost pets are not claimed within a certain number of days they are killed.\nMany people who moved from the suburbs to the city often left their pets on the streets. This is sad.\nI think we should be compassionate. I will definitely review the pet plan and called it \"Creatures big and small care plan\".\n How do you plan to preserve the indigenous art and support multi-cultural aspect of the city?\n Mining companies frequently blasted sacred aboriginal sites destroying precious aboriginal artwork. Some of their art work are actually dumped in shipping containers. Melbourne has so many public galler[ies] and museums. They can be commission to preserve, store and exhibit aboriginal artworks.\n Given the owners profit from pairing up with Airbnb which hikes the house rent \u2014 what is your stance on Airbnb and similar short-stay rentals and their long-term effect on affordability?\n and similar short-stay rental are [an] important source of income for city apartment landlords. Yet they are also a source of disturbances for residents. Residents deserve peace and enjoyment.\nSo Airbnb needs to be regulated. My plan is to have public consultation where all stakeholders get to have a say on the digital democracy platform and hold a virtual forum.\nSome of the initial key consideration[s] include:\n What are some of the strongest criticisms you have received for your plans for Melbourne? How did those criticisms change your views?\n My policies for the city of Melbourne have been collectively suggested by talking to the people of Melbourne through my digital participating democracy platform. So they are populist policies. Few actually criticise them.\nHowever, there is one major challenge. The current tension between Chinese and Australia fuel public speculation about why so many Chinese candidate. They are worried about foreign infiltration. While I enjoy pretty good coverage, many other Chinese/Asian candidates are being teased or harassed. Overall, this does not give a good public image for all Chinese/Asian candidates. Any voters who [do] not know me, may not vote for me because I have a Chinese face.\n If you had to vote for the current candidates other than yourself for this year's election, which three candidates would you vote for? Why?\n What are some of the reasons people may not vote for Team Zorin?\n Reasons:\n In case if you do not win the election, what would be your next plan of action?\n [My] goal is to leverage on the friend and networks [I have] developed to further advance participating democracy in Australia.\nDuring the time as a candidate, I have used any publicity available to promote the concept. I have written to the following part[s] of society:\nI hope to promote the concept to all level[s] of society so they will become more educated and understand its benefits. So when future government can enact direct vote, the great people of Australia can easily follow.\nI will formally form a party called Zorin Australia which will attract member[s] across Australia through the democracy platform.\nWe will also gradually establish a nation-wide democracy platform where the great people of Australia continue to post their issues, solutions, vision, hopes and advise the government on the course of governing.\nThe various champions on the platform can be great candidate[s] to represent the people come next election.\n What do you think of world dominance?\n I do not believe in world dominance. The whole point of the participating democracy or Democracy 2.0 is to give the power to determine by the people.\nThe people collaborate in their own community. The different communities collaborate in a city. Cities collaborate in a state/provinces. Provinces collaborate in a country. Countries collaborate together as part of one cohesive entity.\nOf course, this is a utopia that is not going to happen anytime soon. But it is a model that we hope where countries at different stage of readiness will adopt. Step by step humanity improves.\nImagine we have a new martian colony. What kind of government will we want to be there. We will likely want something like participating democracy, everyone['s] needs are address, everyone collectively decides. So if this is what is in the future, why can['t] we start to slow[ly] adopt this model today.\nAbout multi-cultural aspects of Melbourne.\n What does the demographic of Melbourne currently look like?\n According to 2016 census:\nChildren aged 0\u201314 years made up 3.8% of the population and people aged 65 years and over made up 5.1% of the population. Of people in Melbourne (State Suburbs) aged 15 years and over, 23.7% were married and 5.8% were either divorced or separated.\n0.5% of the population, or 24,062 people, identified as Indigenous Australians (Aboriginal Australians and Torres Strait Islanders) in 2016. Melbourne has the 10th largest immigrant population among world metropolitan areas. In Greater Melbourne at the 2016 census, 63.3% of residents were born in Australia.\n How do you plan on making Melbourne the Repository for Cultural Artefacts and Knowledge?\n I always believe knowledge is humanity['s] biggest achievement. Yet they are constantly be[ing] destroy[ed] by successive regime who see certain part do not align with their ideology. It happens all around the world.\nBut I [don't] want to be racist. I am Chinese. So I can comment on China. For a millenni[um] each imperial dynasty aim[ed] to destroy the knowledge and culture of those that were not compatible with their regime.\nThe biggest destruction was [by] the when he unified China. Even to this day, the Chinese has further destroy[ed] what was traditional China.\nWe see it in , and even in Australia.\nThere are a large part of Australia society which love truth, knowledge and fairness.\nAustralia for the time being is very stable politically. The country geographic is stable with no earthquakes and volcanoes. Humidity is low and weather stable.\nTo sum it up, it is a country suitable to [store] artefact[s] and knowledge that are at risks in their host country. The benefit for Australia is that the world will come and see, bring[ing] tourism.\nThe artefacts will only be preserve[d] here with consent of the traditional owners.\n Are you aware of the (Galleries, Libraries, Archives and Museum) outreach project run by Wikimedia? Do you look forward to facilitating the outreach for mutual benefit? How would you facilitate that?\n I did not know until now. I understand what is GLAM. I think it can serve as a great preservation of culture, artefact while Wikipedia is for the preservation of knowledge. I will look into it in the future.\n What according to you is more important: Representation of minorities in the council or minority citizens getting a platform to express their needs, and grievances? Why? What are your plans to achieve that?\n It's democracy in Australia. The City administration changes after each election. Certain administration may be pro-minority, some may not. Some administration may have good minority representation, some may not.\nSo it is important that there is a platform which empowers the minority to post their needs and discuss their preferences. [By] law if issues are known, they need to be addressed by the government.\nSo it will be ideal that we get both good minority representation in government and the platform to support them. But the former can not be guaranteed.\n Why did you start eTranslate? What type of advice does it provide to the three tiers of government?\n eTranslate has two arms \u2014 the Technology arm \u2014 which focus on empowering technologies to support multicultural user needs and multilingual content.\nThe other is multicultural communication services \u2014 It is a like a Public Relation service but focus on ethnic groups. So our team provide this multicultural PR services to government. We empower the government clients with language resources, cultural expertises and ethnic media channel to interact with their ethnic minority constituents.\nSo we work with all levels of government.\n What are some of the problems ethnic minorities face in Melbourne?\n Due to low fertility rate, Australia has [to] constantly embark on increasing migration to top up its population. As such, there is a diverse set of ethnic minority groups in fact over 80. Australia treat[s] its minority well compare to other OECD [(Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development)] countries. But when you have so many group[s] competing for government priorities, it is hard to find a balance.\nMost of the time, the larger minority group[s] gain more access to resources. This is why my participating democracy platform helps to ensure the needs of all minority groups are identified and addressed \u2014 Thus Precision Policies.\n What percentage of residents in Melbourne and Victoria are aboriginals?\n Melbourne 0.5%, Victoria 1.6%.\n Aboriginal population in Melbourne and in Victoria is very low as compared to other states. Why? And would it make sense to make Melbourne capital of Aboriginals when there aren't enough of them in the city?\n The distribution of indigenous people depends on a lot of factors. These again due to historical reasons that we can go on forever. The are tens of indigenous tribes across the country. Sadly some were hunted to extinction in the last century, particularly in Tasmania.\nMak[ing] a location a capital for the First Nations people will be symbolic rather than totally enshrine[d] in law. Ideally it would be best in the . But unless I was a mayor there, it may not happen.\nSo having [it] in Melbourne does allow some symbolic and provide a forum for the different tribes to gather and have open discussions.\nThe \"capital\" can rotate from city to city periodically if other cities allow. But ultimately it will be up to the elders to approve.\n How [do] you envision Melbourne would look like by 2025 under your mayorship?\n Each mayor term is 4 years, that takes it to 2024 at the latest. Realistically, Melbourne and Australia being a much smaller economy will take longer to recover from COVID-19.\nSo to be practical, we hope the city will attain the following by 2024-25:\n If elected, what would constitute a successful mayorship for you?\n I believe what constitute a successful mayorship are\nFurther thoughts.\nWayne Tseng also shared his insights on various things on how collaboration between the members of society,\n Just [to] summarise:\nSince I was 10, I watched how the ant[s] collaborate. I asked how we people can collaborate further. In school, I appreciated competition bring creativity. But I also believe collaboration ensures not only creativity, but accountability, responsibility, integrity and productivity.\nWhen I was in university, my computer studies focused on collaborative computing. My post graduate research was on software globalisation \u2014 again global collaboration.\nMy company eTranslate really aims to empower companies to go global while in Australia assist all ethnic minority groups collaborate and co-exist in harmony.\nIn politics, I seek to find a solution where we can reach consensus. It does not have to be LEFT or RIGHT, black or white. Democracy is one system that endures, but it is no longer acceptable to just say majority rules. This led me to participating democracy or Democracy 2.0.\nOnce can say \u2014 So my life experience really led me towards participating democracy or Democracy 2.0.\n Democracy 2.0:\nWhen I gave presentation, I always said if there is a now, what kind of political system or government would you prefer: Authoritarianism, Communism, Fascism, Monarchy or Democracy?\nIf Democracy, do you want to be squeeze[d] to either the LEFT or the RIGHT or only majority rules? Or may be you want a collective government where the needs of everyone is addressed. So that's participating democracy. Now if that is the future, why don't we progress towards this TODAY.\nI have developed an index to measure to what degree a country has adopted participating democracy. I share this in the future topic.\n Society 1.0:\nWhile developing the model for participating democracy, I saw many institutions have refined processes and some have matured to a point where it is like a car. The [model], functions and overall attributes of a car is matured.\nImagine that we put all the attributes of an institution whether a health system, a hospital, a school or an education department in a bottle. We can deploy this to other countries that have [not] yet got such a matured setup.\nNow imagine we got a whole matured community or city setup in bottle, this can be deploy to new city setup in the dessert or new settled land.\nNow imagine after exchanging and further developing these setup. Eventually, like a car which is quite mature, we have a setup or definition of a city or SOCIETY that is almost universally accepted. I call this SOCIETY 1.0.\nDemocracy 2.0 can lead to SOCIETY 1.0. The ongoing debate of how to govern a society will lead to a universally agreed FORMAT/SETUP/DEFINITION of a SOCIETY.\nDuring COVID-19, the ability of different medical centres to collaborate in the development and trialling of different vaccine candidates showed the need to standardise setup of clinics, hospital and even the health ministry.

The blockade came after GitHub received a Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) take-down notice from the (RIAA). After stripping the metadata from the notice, GitHub published the take-down notice on their site.\nInitially started in July 2008 by Ricardo Garcia, youtube-dl is a written in which can download videos from multiple websites including YouTube, and . youtube-dl is a FLOSS software and is under . Currently, the repository on GitHub is locked for viewers other than maintainers of the project.\nRIAA's DMCA notice alleged the script's purpose of existence was to \"circumvent the technological protection measures used by authorized streaming services such as YouTube\" and \"reproduce and distribute music videos and sound recordings owned by our member companies without authorization for such use\". \nyoutube-dl has multiple in its source code, which test whether the software works in different circumstances or not. Some of the tests include checking if the script can download Creative Commons licensed videos, videos which did not have square pixels, videos with no age restriction, \"offensive to some audiences\" per YouTube community and age-restricted videos. One of the tests included the of some copyrighted songs. Citing this test, RIAA's take-down notice claimed \"comments in the youtube-dl source code make clear that the source code was designed and is marketed for the purpose of circumventing YouTube's technological measures\".\nRIAA's notice published by GitHub alleged violation of 17 U.S. Code \u00a7 1201 Circumvention of copyright protection systems which says \"No person shall circumvent a technological measure that effectively controls access to a work protected under this title\". RIAA listed a number of forks of youtube-dl and requested GitHub via the notice they all be made inaccessible.\nThe notice did not list any incident of anyone using youtube-dl to download or share copyrighted material, nor mention any damages that actually occurred. Unremarked by the notice, YouTube allows videos to be licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution license. When a copyright holder chooses to release their work, be it a photograph, a video, or audio, under a Creative Commons Attribution (CC BY) license, they allow everyone to freely own, share or modify the work as long as the reusers properly attribute the author of the work. YouTube also hosts many audio and video recordings in the public domain which can be used for any purpose without any restrictions.\nyoutube-dl is used by thousands of people around the world. Multiple Creative Commons-licensed and public domain videos on are uploaded via a tool called video2commons, which relies on youtube-dl to download media. youtube-dl also lets users download videos from LiveLeak \u2014 a video-sharing platform for citizen journalism. Videos downloaded using youtube-dl are also used for the purpose of , or for evidence.\nyoutube-dl comes with a small interpreter where it acts as a would behave while receiving video data from the server. The script has \"extractors\" for various websites to handle videos from different sources. Whenever something is displayed on the user's screen, the device has a copy of that content. Web browsers \"download\" data while surfing the web, though most of it is not persistent on the device. It is possible to download copyrighted photos by using a web-browser. The way the works, there are no technological prevention measures to prevent recording and sharing of content such as RIAA talks about in the notice. Photos and texts can be downloaded by taking screenshots, videos by screen recording tools, and audio by recording on a tape if not an audio recording software.\nMultiple users expressed their disappointment on Twitter and . One of the users said \"this is yet another example of why we should use as it was intended, as a distributed network, rather than rely on one single proprietary server\". Git is decentralised version-tracking software which is used by a large number of software companies and projects. It is possible to host one's own git server for software development. While Microsoft's GitHub is a centralised git server, development of software using git does not require a GitHub account.\nSoon after the public access to the repository was locked, multiple users started sharing the source code via self-hosted servers, sites and via the leading to a Streisand effect. Streisand effect is when a measure to information causes further spread of that information. The binary files of the software are still available on its website for users to download. Some people came up with esoteric ways to share the source code, by converting the compressed code into photographs and providing shell commands to convert to the source code.\nGitHub's DMCA repository, where the takedown notice was published for public viewing, was subject to contant vandalism from multiple GitHub users. One user submitted a , the source code of youtube-dl along with the DMCA repository. This enabled users to view youtube-dl's source code from within the DMCA repository, provided they know the commit id.\nThe Electronic Frontier Foundation said on Twitter \"Youtube-dl is a legitimate tool with a world of a lawful uses. Demanding its removal from Github is a disappointing and counterproductive move by the RIAA.\" Richard Stallman, the founder of the Free Software Foundation, has been highly critical of DRM (digital rights management, the subject of the DMCA) for many years now.\n\"Wikinews\" reached out to Sergey M\u2024, one of the maintainers of youtube-dl script, however Sergey said he \"won't give any comments at this time\". Later, he shared an update on the IRC channel. Sergey said, \"they require complete removal of so called YouTube's rolling cipher implementation [...] GitHub requires in order to reinstate the repo [...] under this conditions I could reinstate it in Saturday/Sunday already but this is an unsatisfactory outcome\". He also said, \"I can't guarantee whether [or] not we will bend over them considering the situation with @phihag [Philipp Hagemeister] but we'll see soon what we can do in order to keep the max we have and mitigate potential legal issues at the same time\".\nEFF is yet to respond to \"Wikinews\" queries. \"Wikinews\" also reached out to Philipp Hagemeister, a former maintainer and contributor of the youtube-dl project to discuss this takedown.\n When did you get to know about the takedown notice and what were your initial reactions?\n I saw the takedown notice along with anyone else, on reddit. Since I am no longer involved with the youtube-dl project (except for occasional contributions, my maintainership ended in 2016), I don't know any details.\n Does YouTube implement DRM for videos not under Creative Commons license, and if so, how does youtube-dl bypass it? Could you please elaborate the procedure?\n YouTube implements DRM for YouTube Movies. youtube-dl does not support those.\nYouTube has multiple non-DRM video delivery protocols. I'm not up to date about specifics; my last dabbling in this was in 2015.\nOne of these protocols is described here. YouTube uses to compute parts of the URLs. youtube-dl executes this JavaScript, just like a web browser.\n Could you also explain in brief how youtube-dl functions, and how the maintainers had intended it to be used?\n youtube-dl downloads and plays videos and music, just like any other web browser, from over 1000 different services. Its uses are varied: It enables video playback on many devices (e.g. ) where the video services don't work properly, it makes high-quality video playable for people with a bad or no Internet connection, it enables disabled users to use tools to play videos, and it is used for archival and research.\n What do you think of the DMCA notice?\n I think it is not warranted because youtube-dl is entirely legal. As the DMCA notice has no effect for me personally, I'm not really the right person to address it.\n Why were the copyrighted tests in the source code? Could they be replaced?\n I'm not sure why, but my guess is that users requested support for these videos and thus they were added as test cases. They can be removed trivially, without losing any function of youtube-dl.\n Are you aware Electronic Frontier Foundation said it was a \"disappointing and counterproductive move\"? What do you think should be the next steps?\n Yes, and I concur. I'm no longer involved in the project. If I were, I would probably just remove the test cases, block these music videos (RIAA is not worth the trouble for me, that can be done by other projects), and get the project back online.\nI understand people who think differently."}

It features original material compiled throughout the previous month after an overview of the month's biggest stories.\nThis month's spotlight on the campaign trail: the Libertarian Party's presidential nominee secures ballot access in all 50 U.S. states, the Unity Party of America presidential nominee proposes a novel solution to the issue of \"packing\" the U.S. Supreme Court, and three candidates give their thoughts on the latest military conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan.\nSummary.\nAs the campaign entered September, Democratic Party presidential nominee Joe Biden led President Donald Trump, the Republican Party presidential nominee, in the head-to-head polling average, 49.0 percent to 43.0 percent.\nPresident Trump started the month visiting , Wisconsin, where riots had broken out due to the police in August. Trump referred to the riots as acts of \"domestic terror\" and placed further emphasis on maintaining \".\" His opponent, Biden, in a message to fundraisers, accused Trump of \"trying to scare the hell out of America.\" Biden himself visited Kenosha two days after Trump in what was his first campaign trip to the swing state of Wisconsin. During the appearance, Biden delivered a speech on racial inequality while wearing a mask, discussing the \"original sin\" of . He also visited the family of Jacob Blake and spoke to Blake on the phone. The Trump campaign criticized Biden for not denouncing and for making the trip despite claiming previously that it was not safe to do so due to the coronavirus pandemic. Wisconsin , a Democrat, said he would have preferred that neither Trump nor Biden had made the stop. At least three unfavorable claims about Trump surfaced in early September. First, after CNN reporter and former Bill Clinton questioned whether the President's impromptu visit to last November was the result of a stroke, Trump alleged the media was falsely claiming he had suffered from \"mini-strokes.\" Thereafter, posted a report from ' about Trump's \"mini-strokes\" tweet as the top story on the '. Trump attacked Drudge as a and his campaign called for CNN to fire Lockhart. Next, ' claimed that during a 2018 trip to France, Trump refused to visit a cemetery of U.S. soldiers killed during the World War I and referred to the soldiers buried there as \"losers\" and \"suckers.\" Furthermore, Trump allegedly questioned whether the U.S. allied with the correct side during the war. Aides publicly denied the story as did Trump-critic and former John Bolton. Nevertheless, others, including Fox News reporter , confirmed key parts of the story. Trump called on Fox News to fire Griffin. Lastly, excerpts from 's book ', for which Trump gave insider access, revealed Trump downplayed the coronavirus in February in order to avoid public panic. Trump confirmed the claim, arguing it was not in the national interest to stir up panic about the virus. Biden, while campaigning in Michigan, called Trump's action \"a life-and-death betrayal of the American people.\" He described it as \"beyond despicable\" and \"almost criminal.\" \nTrump stirred controversy for himself both during an interview with a local , North Carolina outlet and again at a rally in Pennsylvania. He suggested supporters fill out absentee ballots, and then visit their polling places and vote in-person if records indicated they had not voted. After Trump tweeted the same advice, Twitter placed a warning over the tweet. People in the Trump administration and campaign said his comments were misconstrued and that he did not support voting twice. According to the , voting twice is a felony.\nIn mid-September, Trump held his first indoor rally in three months, in Nevada, flouting local coronavirus mandates. Afterwards Trump visited California to discuss the havoc in the state. In a public briefing that included California Gavin Newsom, Trump denied the effect of climate change on the intensity of the fires, arguing they were largely the product of forest mismanagement. The climate change issue reappeared on the campaign trail. Biden delivered a speech in Delaware in which he called Trump a \"climate arsonist,\" citing the recent California wildfires, flooding and . He argued that if Trump wins re-election, \"these hellish events will continue to become more common.\" In Florida, where hurricanes have a disproportionate impact, polls revealed Trump strengthening with ; perhaps due, president Domingo Garcia indicated, to Trump's social conservative positions and stances against socialism and protests. As Kamala Harris visited the state and focused more on the constituency, Biden campaign officials expressed concern about Latino support. Biden improved his standing among another large voting bloc in Florida, , who voted heavily for Trump in 2016. Furthermore, a major boost for Biden in Florida came with the announcement that former New York City Michael Bloomberg planned to invest US$100 million into the state and offered to pay fines for former inmates to regain their ability to vote. Trump claimed the move was criminal. \nBuilding on the brokered between Israel and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) the previous month, the Trump administration announced additional deals Israel and Bahrain and between Serbia, Kosovo, and Israel. Like the UAE, the Muslim majority nations of Bahrain and Kosovo recognized Israel and opened diplomatic relations with the nation. The formerly antagonistic nations of Serbia and Kosovo opened economic ties as well and Serbia agreed to move its embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. Representatives from the UAE, Bahrain, and Israel held a special signing at the White House with President Trump. Trump hailed the agreements as the \"dawn of a new Middle East.\" Meanwhile, the between Armenia and Azerbaijan over the disputed escalated to violence. Back home, Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg died, leaving an opening on the Court. Democrats claimed the election should decide who picks the next justice, citing the Republicans' refusal to consider President Barack Obama's nomination of after the death of Antonin Scalia in 2016. Republicans argued this was a different situation than in 2016 because now the party controlling the Senate matches the President's party. President Trump nominated Federal Judge for the seat. Citing concerns Barrett's placement would upset the balance of the Court for conservatives, some Democrats advocated the Court with liberal justices until it reached a liberal majority. That would only be possible if Democrats won the presidency and the Senate. When confronted with the possibility of Democrats winning the election, Trump would not commit to a peaceful transfer of power, claiming the possibility of fraud occurring as a result of increased mail-in voting. Trump received criticism for the statement. Republican Senator Mitt Romney, a sometime Trump critic, said the peaceful transfer of power is what separates the U.S. from nations like Belarus, and described Trump's potential unwillingness as \"unthinkable and unacceptable.\" The Biden campaign recycled a statement it first put out in July: \"The American people will decide this election. And the United States government is perfectly capable of escorting trespassers out of the White House.\" Trump received further criticism just ahead of the first presidential debate, when \"The New York Times\" published allegations about his tax returns. The reports indicated Trump paid US$750 in taxes in 2016 and the same amount in 2017, and that he owed on loans in excess of US$300 million due in four years. Trump labeled the report as \"\" and said he would release his tax returns once he was no longer under audit. Biden left the campaign trail a few days before the debate to prepare both virtually and in-person at his Delaware house. According to CNN, a source told them Trump prepared for a total of two hours, enlisting help from former New Jersey Chris Christie and former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani. He continued to hold campaign rallies and White House events.\nThe first presidential debate between Trump and Biden took place on the penultimate day of September in Ohio. During the debate, the candidates often interrupted each other. Although Biden was the first to do so, Trump interrupted far more often. Moderator was criticized for his inability to maintain control. During the debate, Biden would not say whether or not he supported Court packing. Once, when Trump interjected, Biden said \"Will you Shut up, man?\" During the course of the debate, Biden called Trump a clown, a racist, and the worst president. Trump insulted Biden as unintelligent. After Biden attacked Trump for the alleged \"losers\" and \"suckers\" comment reported in \"The Atlantic\", Trump brought up Biden's son and his dealings in Ukraine and China. Biden defended his son's struggle with drugs. Biden attacked Trump for the over 200,000 U.S. deaths from coronavirus. Trump countered that Biden would have lost even more if he were president due to his opposition to the from China. Trump claimed Democrats pushed Biden to the far left on , the and defunding the Police. Biden referred to himself as the Democratic Party and said he did not support the policies Trump mentioned. Trump argued Biden had just lost the far left by saying he didn't support those things. He challenged Biden to name any law enforcement individuals or groups who endorsed Biden's campaign, which Biden did not do. Trump made a confusing statement about the far right organization , when asked to condemn them, stating \"stand back and stand by\" but argued the far left Antifa organization needed to be addressed. Biden called Antifa an \"idea.\" Trump continued his claims about postal voting causing fraud and again would not commit to accepting the results of the election. After the debate, CNN anchor described the event as a \"shitshow.\" Republican Senator had the same response. Fox News commentator called it \"a mess.\" Biden called Trump a \"national embarrassment\" for his performance, while the communications director for the Trump campaign, Tim Murtaugh, declared victory for Trump. According to the , moderators would have \"additional tools\" to maintain order in future debates.\nAs September came to a close, Biden maintained his lead over President Trump in the RealClearPolitics head-to-head polling average, 49.7 percent to 43.1 percent.\nSpotlight.\nOn the ballot in all 50 states.\nLibertarian Party presidential candidate passed a milestone in September, becoming the only third party candidate in this election to secure ballot access in all states and the District of Columbia. The party had the same access in 2016, but in that cycle there was no coronavirus pandemic hampering petitioning efforts. Before 2016, the last time the Libertarian Party had ballot access in all jurisdictions was when Jorgensen was on the ballot as the running mate of the late . The Browne-Jorgensen ticket, as well as the Reform Party ticket of the late that same year, was the last time before 2016 that any third party or independent candidate achieved full ballot access.\nIn a celebratory email to supporters, Jorgensen exclaimed: \"It's official \u2014 my campaign is on ballot in ALL 50 states! I want to thank all the volunteers and staff who made this possible. It was a lot of work! We're talking about hours upon hours of collecting petitions.\"\nWith the access secured, Jorgensen aimed to gain entry to the presidential debates sponsored by the . The Commission's criterion for inclusion remains a showing of 15 percent support in opinion polls. In late September polls, when included, Jorgensen was in third place. \u00a0She drew two percent in the September 25\u201327 poll, two percent in the September 26\u201327 Redfield &amp; Wilton Strategies survey, and five percent in the September 25\u201327 Analytics poll.\n\"We are the real choice for American voters in November,\" Jorgensen argued, \"yet the corrupt Commission on Presidential Debates refuses to have me. Our campaign is the only viable option to both Trump or Biden.\"\nIn 2016, despite full ballot access and a lawsuit against the Commission on Presidential Debates, then-Libertarian presidential nominee Gary Johnson was denied access to the debates. Nevertheless, he received 3.27 percent of the vote on Election Day, the most a Libertarian Party presidential nominee has ever received.\nA novel approach to Court packing.\nIn mid-September, staunch Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg died after a long battle with cancer. President Trump nominated as her replacement. With a Republican majority in the U.S. Senate, Barrett's confirmation was likely, resulting a 6\u20133 majority for conservatives in the Court. In response, some Democrats, such as former 2020 presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of , Indiana, proposed major changes to the Court, similar to what President proposed in the 1930s. While Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden did not say in the debate whether he supports significant changes, one third party presidential nominee proposed to \"Wikinews\" a novel approach, aiming both to prevent future Court packing and promote ideological balance.\nAfter his programs suffered a series of defeats in the Supreme Court, President Roosevelt looked to add justices that would interpret the Constitution to uphold his agenda. Capitalizing on the public perception of the Court as being too old, Roosevelt sought to tie the number of justices to age. In 1937, he proposed a to amend the , which sets the number of Supreme Court justices at nine.\nRoosevelt's bill would allow the President to nominate one additional justice for every justice over the age of 70 years and six months with at least ten years of experience on the bench. The proposal capped the number of justices to be nominated this way at six. The plan did not receive much support, even from his own Democratic Party. The Senate voted 70 to 20 to send the bill back to committee, where it died.\nNow, 83 years later, some Democrats have revisited a plan to expand the number of justices that Buttigieg proposed during his campaign. He suggested expanding the Court to 15 justices: five Republicans, five Democrats, and five to be chosen by the other justices. Other Democratic plans include a straight-up expansion of the number of justices and a plan to institute term limits for justices. According to a 2019 poll, 57 percent of the U.S. public opposes expanding the number of justices. However, 72 percent support term limits.\nBill Hammons, 2020 presidential nominee of the Unity Party of America, whose running mate Eric Bodenstab spoke to \"Wikinews\" in August, provided \"Wikinews\" with his own plan for the Court. \u00a0While it would expand the number of justices, it aims to prevent future Court packing:\n\"The number of Justices should be set at 13 with a to prevent future Court Packing,\" says Hammons, \"and the four new Justices should be smart non-ideologues who have been ignored for their lack of ideology.\"\nThe U.S. Constitution provides two ways to propose a Constitutional Amendment as Hammons proposes: (1) a two-thirds affirmative vote in the Senate and House of Representatives, or (2) an affirmative vote in the state legislatures of two-thirds of the states to call a constitutional convention. The latter route has not yet been used. If an amendment is successfully proposed, three-quarters of states must then ratify it in order for the amendment to become part of the Constitution. The last successful amendment occurred in 1992.\nWhile both the Hammons plan and the Buttigieg plan aim for balance, Hammons's approach differs from Buttigieg's in that future Court packing, like that proposed from President Roosevelt, would not be possible absent further amendment to the Constitution. Furthermore, there is no partisan classification of justices provided and party identification does not serve as the basis for judicial ideology. Curiously, the number of justices Hammons favors matches the current number of ; the courts from which the Supreme Court hears appeals.\nCandidates react to the Armenia-Azerbaijan conflict.\nA longstanding conflict between the nations of Armenia and Azerbaijan erupted into violence late in September. The between the two centers on the region. It lies within the internationally-recognized borders of Azerbaijan but the Armenian-backed separatist currently occupies it. After inquiry from \"Wikinews\", U.S. presidential candidates of the Prohibition Party, Don Blankenship of the Constitution Party, and Jo Jorgensen of the Libertarian Party, weighed in on the issue.\nArmenia and Azerbaijan fought a over the Nagorno-Karabakh region in 1994. Russia brokered a cease-fire agreement but skirmishes continued to break out. The latest violence began with conflicting claims from both sides. The Armenians claim they were retaliating against missile attacks from Azerbaijan. The Azerbaijanis state they were responding to Armenian aggression. The president of Turkey vowed support for Azerbaijan, while Russia called for a cessation of fighting. As of September 30, Armenia claimed 790 Azerbaijani soldiers had been killed, with 103 Artsakh deaths. Azerbaijan claimed to have killed about 2,300 Artsakh soldiers.\nPresident Trump commented on the matter during a White House Press Briefing, \"[W]e're looking at it very strongly. [...] We have a lot of good relationships in that area. We'll see if we can stop it.\" Although Trump's State Department asked for any \"external party\" not to involve themselves in the conflict, his main presidential rival Joe Biden called on the President to demand directly that Turkey stop interfering on Azerbaijan's behalf.\nCollins saw compromise as the best way for the two nations to resolve their differences: \"I think that those countries should compromise and split the disputed area in half.\" Nevertheless, Collins did not want the U.S. to involve itself militarily and calls on Washington to remain neutral. His opponents, Jorgensen and Blankenship, shared this view.\n\"The conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan is their conflict. Not ours\", said Jorgensen. \"We have no business taking either side. Our foreign policy should resemble one giant Switzerland, armed and neutral.\"\nBlankenship concurred: \"We need to stop policing the world and allow other countries to manage their own affairs\", he argued. \"We need to withdraw our troops from all but a very few foreign countries. Armenia and Azerbaijan should be given the freedom to solve their own issues. \" \nThere is precedent for the U.S. President mediating international disputes. In 1905, President mediated a peace agreement between Japan and Russia, fostering the that ended the . Roosevelt's efforts earned him the Nobel Peace Prize. President Jimmy Carter mediated an end to the conflict between Israel and Egypt at the in 1978 that brought about the 1979 and the normalization of relations between the two nations. The cited this in awarding Carter the 2002 Peace Prize. And President Trump, in September 2020, addressed the in mediating the that normalized relations between Israel and the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain."}

Doctors reportedly treated the president with a cocktail of medicines that included an experimental drug from as well as the anti-viral and the steroid . His condition was said to be improving and he posted a four minute long video from the hospital. Supporters gathered outside and Trump made a much-criticized ride to wave at them from the presidential limousine. After a three day stay, Trump was released from the hospital and returned to the White House. He tweeted, \"Don't be afraid of Covid. Don\u2019t let it dominate your life.\" A couple days after Trump\u2019s release, the only vice presidential debate between Vice President Mike Pence and Democratic vice presidential nominee Kamala Harris took place in Utah, moderated by \"USA Today\" Washington Bureau Chief . Pence often spoke over his allotted time and interjected. In one exchange, as Pence attempted to interrupt, Harris exclaimed, \"Mr. Vice President, I'm speaking.\" A fly landed on Pence's hair for about two minutes. Page received criticism for not asking follow-up questions. Politico regarded the debate as \"markedly more civil\" than the prior Trump-Biden debate. The next day, the announced its second official presidential debate between Trump and Biden would be virtual due to President Trump's positive COVID-19 test. Trump declined such an arrangement and the Commission canceled the debate. In its place, Biden scheduled a town hall to air on ABC. Trump later scheduled a competing town hall on NBC.\nWith the Supreme Court confirmation hearings for looming, the issue of returned. Biden and Harris both refused to answer whether they would support Court packing. Biden said voters \"don't deserve\" to know his position. A few days later, Biden made another frank comment when he claimed 56 percent of respondents to a poll, who regarded their personal situation as better now than four years ago, were not remembering correctly, adding people should vote, whatever their beliefs. Still recovering from coronavirus, Trump gave his first speech since the diagnosis from the White House balcony. Trump's doctors said the President no longer posed a risk of spreading the virus. Two days later, he returned to the campaign trail with a rally in , Florida. At the rally, Trump declared himself \"immune\" and offered to kiss members of the crowd. White House doctors said Trump tested negative for COVID-19 for two consecutive days.\nIn another potential \"October surprise,\" on the week of Trump and Biden's dueling town halls, the ' published an article about the discovery of a laptop belonging to Biden's son Hunter that he allegedly abandoned at a Delaware computer repair shop. According to the Post, former Trump adviser told them of its existence and current Trump personal attorney Rudy Giuliani, the former , recently gave them a copy of its harddrive's contents allegedly obtained from the shop owner. E-mails in the copy detailed Hunter's worldwide business affairs and alleged . Contrary to the elder Biden's assurances he had no involvement in his son's business deals, an e-mail alluded to a 2015 meeting between the elder Biden and a Ukranian adviser to the board of the energy company , on which Hunter served. The report claimed after the meeting the elder Biden used his influence as vice president to have a Ukrainian prosecutor investigating Burisma fired. The material also contained a video of Hunter smoking crack cocaine and taking part in a sex act. Fifty former intelligence officials, including former CIA John Brennan, Leon Panetta, and , signed a letter saying the \"Post'\u200d\"s report \"has all the classic earmarks of a Russian information operation.\" Current Director of National Intelligence said the information was \"not part of some Russian disinformation campaign.\" According to \"The Washington Post\", intelligence officials warned the administration last December that Giuliani could be a conduit for Russian disinformation. Twitter prevented users from sharing the \"Post\" story, claiming it violated their policy on hacked materials. Twitter CEO later said they made a mistake. Facebook did not censor the story but limited its spread on their platform. Shortly after the report, Trump and Biden held the dueling town halls on NBC and ABC, respectively. While NBC simulcast Trump's hour long town hall, hosted by , on the main network as well as MSNBC and , ABC broadcast Biden's town hall with for two hours. The broadcast of Biden's event received more viewers than Trump's event. At his town hall, which newspaper ' described as combative, Trump refused to disavow the and defended his pandemic policies. At Biden's event, Biden implied he would consider making a potential COVID-19 vaccine mandatory. On Court packing, he said his decision would depend on how the Senate conducts the Barrett confirmation hearing.\nThe Commission on Presidential Debates announced the moderator for the third debate would have a mute button to prevent interruptions during the first two minute candidate responses with each question. Biden left the campaign trail to prepare for the debate. Trump did minimal preparation, holding rallies instead. At this time, he made critical remarks about director Dr. and posted footage on Twitter from a soon-to-be released \"60 Minutes\" interview with , that Trump claimed was unfair. Trump's previous debate prepper Giuliani received further media scrutiny when he appeared in the \"\". In a scene, Giuliani goes into a hotel bedroom, where a hidden camera records him lying on a bed with his hands in his pants in the company of a young actress posing as a conservative journalist. Giuliani claimed he was tucking in his shirt after removing his microphone and suggested Borat actor and producer may have deceptively edited the footage. Giuliani received news concerning the laptop harddrive data in his possession: Fox News reported two separate law enforcement sources confirmed an FBI money laundering probe connected to the laptop. Additionally, Ratcliffe and FBI director held a press conference discussing concerns about Iranian and Russian interference in the election. Ratcliffe claimed Iran spoofed e-mails to spread false information about voting to hurt President Trump's chances of re-election. Former Trump adviser Steve Bannon predicted Trump would run for president again in 2024 if he lost in 2020. Democrats continued to attack Trump on his taxes. Senator Bernie Sanders slammed Trump for a \"New York Times\" story alleging Trump paid more taxes to the Chinese and other governments than to the United States. \u00a0\nJust before the final presidential debate, Hunter Biden's former business partner Tony Bobulinski held a press conference claiming Joe Biden knew about his son's business deals, particularly with China, and that the elder Biden was involved with them. He claimed to have evidence supporting the claim. The issue came up at the , Tennessee-set second presidential debate, moderated by of NBC News. Biden denied the allegations, labeled them as Russian disinformation. Echoing an email from Hunter Biden's laptop referencing a mysterious \"big guy\" who received a cut of money, Trump said, \"You're the big man, I think.\" Trump attacked Biden for accumulating wealth since leaving public office, accusing the Biden family of going around the world and sucking up money like a vacuum. Biden slammed Trump, viewing the president as having no plan to combat COVID-19. Trump said he banned travel from China in January, which Biden opposed as . He claimed a vaccine was near and said people are \"learning to live\" with the virus. Biden countered that people are instead \"learning to die\" with it. Biden argued that Trump had no healthcare plan. He proposed a and claimed nobody lost their health insurance as a result of Obamacare. Trump alleged Biden's plan would strip and . He vowed to protect people with from being denied health coverage.

Biden asked Trump to post the video on his website. Welker brought up the at the border. Trump point out the Obama administration constructed the cages seen in widely circulated photos taken in 2014. Trump blasted Biden as a career politician and repeatedly asked why Biden did not already implement the policies he proposed. Biden attacked Trump on paying fewer taxes to which Trump claimed he prepaid \"millions of dollars\" in taxes. Trump cornered Biden on when Biden admitted wanting to phase out the industry. Trump said Biden just lost Texas, Pennsylvania, Oklahoma, and Ohio as a consequence. Welker received near-universal praise for her performance. Observers noted the debate was more orderly than the first.\nIn the final days of October, Trump ramped up his campaign, holding up to five rallies a day throughout such states as Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Iowa, Nebraska, Arizona, and Florida, among others. Biden limited campaigning but still made stops in Pennsylvania, Georgia, Florida, Iowa, Wisconsin, and others. Due to COVID-19, attendees to Biden events were required to socially distance or to stay in their automobiles with horns in the place of applause. At one Biden rally in Pennsylvania, Trump supporters audibly chanted slogans nearby. Biden referred to the people as \"chumps.\" At another in Minnesota, Biden referred to hecklers as \"ugly folks.\" Meanwhile, a series of news events broke as Election Day drew closer. The Senate confirmed judge Barrett to the Supreme Court. Justice Clarence Thomas swore her in at a White House ceremony with Trump looking on. The White House also announced a deal it brokered to normalize relations between Sudan and Israel. This followed deals the administration brokered between Israel and the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, and Kosovo, in recent months. The fatal police , a mentally ill African American man armed with a knife, sparked riots and looting in Philadelphia. Biden-Harris released a statement: \"[w]e cannot accept that in this country a mental health crisis ends in death.\" President Trump called it a \"terrible event\" but urged for the National Guard to be brought in to end the violence. Category Two slammed into the Louisiana coast. Winds from the storm delayed a rally Trump planned for North Carolina. The anonymous insider who wrote \"New York Times\" op-eds and a book critical of the Trump administration was revealed to be former chief of staff . The Trump campaign described Taylor as \"just another standard-issue arrogant, Washington, DC swamp bro who loved President Trump until he figured out he could try to make money by attacking him\". The released a report showing growth in of 33.1 percent in the third quarter of 2020. This was the largest growth for the nation in a quarter since World War II, topping the record of 16.7 percent in the first quarter of 1950. Trump hailed the report on Twitter and warned that Biden could destroy the growth with his proposed tax increases. Biden described the growth as not \"nearly enough.\"\nAt the end of October, President Trump trailed former Vice President Biden in the RealClearPolitics head-to-head matchup, 51.3 to 43.5 percent.\nSpotlight.\nFree and Equal debates.\nThe held two debates in October, attracting third party and independent candidates. The criterion for inclusion was ballot access in at least eight states. \u00a0The two major party candidates qualified but were barred from participating due to the contracts they signed with the . \u00a0Libertarian Party presidential nominee , Alliance Party presidential nominee Rocky De La Fuente, and rapper were each invited but did not attend. \u00a0Those who did take part in-person were: Independent presidential candidate , Green Party presidential nominee , Constitution Party presidential nominee Don Blankenship, presidential nominee , and presidential nominee . \u00a0All of these candidates also confirmed for the final debate, but Blankenship ultimately decided not to attend. Free and Equal Elections Foundation founder and director moderated both debates. This was the fourth election cycle the foundation has held a debate. \u00a0The debates used the format the developed when \u00a0they held the official presidential debates before the creation of the Commission on Presidential Debates.\nAt the initial debate, held October 8 in Denver, Colorado, after opening statements, the candidates received a total of 13 questions on the\u00a0, and , national debate reform, the surveillance state, space warfare, indigenous rights, police reform, education reform, Yemen, the , vaccinations,\u00a0gun rights, and excessive imprisonment. Questioners included Tobin, anti-war activist Cindy Sheehan, Aaron Hamlin of , Eli Beckerman of Open the Debates, actor , SpaceX co-founder , indigenous leader Doug Good Feather, and the mother of prisoner \u00a0. \u00a0The debate closed with final statements from each candidate.\nIn opening the debate, Carroll introduced himself as \"pro-life\" and said climate change must be addressed. \u00a0Pierce derided the two party system and argued it cannot resolve the nation's problems. La Riva blamed as the root of all the nation's ills.\u00a0 Blankenship offered US$1 million to to have a debate with Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden and made the same offer available to President Donald Trump. And Hawkins, the only candidate wearing a facemask, endorsed the and the . \u00a0\nThe candidates agreed on many issues with varied nuances. All supported the removal of US troops from Afghanistan though Pierce and Carroll raised concerns about the problems that \u00a0could arise from a hasty withdrawal. \u00a0While La Riva and Hawkins attacked war as a tool of the US ruling class, Blankenship wanted the US to avoid being the policeman of the world. \u00a0Blankenship described efforts toward approval or rank choice voting as too complicated and \"diluting\" efforts toward ballot access. All the other candidates favored rank choice voting. \u00a0La Riva favored offering voting rights to documented and undocumented immigrants, prisoners, and youths aged 16 to 18 years. \u00a0Most candidates felt the League of Women Voters did a better job holding debates than the Commission on Presidential Debates, agreeing the sponsor should be nonpartisan. Pierce commented on the unfairness of \"rigged polls\" excluding third party candidates. Blankenship attacked the media for maintaining the status quo, providing an example of the media falsely describing him as a \"felon\" ahead of the 2018 West Virginia Republican Senate primary. Blankenship favored expanding space exploration, arguing the US should be at the lead rather than some other nation. La Riva criticized any space agency as militaristic. \u00a0Most candidates agreed to the need of an international body to regulate space. On Police reform, Blankenship and Carroll expressed opposition to while La Riva fully endorsed it, Hawkins expressed an interest in community control of the police, and Pierce focused on providing further training for officers. \u00a0Pierce and Carroll endorsed , though Carroll expressed concerns about for-profit schools. Hawkins said many charter schools were scams. \u00a0La Riva said she fully opposed charter schools. Pierce called for an end to the War on Drugs, with which Hawkins and La Riva somewhat agreed. La Riva agreed and favored prosecuting banks for providing funds and said legalization would not be helpful, cautioning about the dangers of pharmaceuticals. Hawkins called for the decriminalization of drugs like Portugal but felt those exploiting others should be prosecuted. He favored providing medical access for addicts. Blankenship opposed ending the War on Drugs but said those at the top should be prosecuting rather than users. \u00a0Carroll agreed and cautioned about the effect of cannabis use on the brain. La Riva, Hawkins, Blankenship, and Carroll all agreed that vaccines have done more good than harm. Hawkins, Blankenship, and Carroll all argued they should not be mandatory. Pierce said he would not take a vaccine for COVID-19, claiming it alters the recipient's and turns them into \"genetically modified humans.\" \u00a0Carroll and La Riva disagreed about whether a clinic in San Francisco was selling the body parts of aborted fetuses. \u00a0La Riva said she fully supports abortion rights. \u00a0On the issue of guns, Pierce expressed concern about the number of US citizens purchasing guns and warned of an impending civil war.\nIn closing, Pierce urged voters to \"vote their conscience.\" La Riva argued that only socialism can bring about equality to the nation. \u00a0Blankenship claimed he was the only candidate on the stage who based his platform on the US Constitution and called for the use of cost-benefit analysis for policy. \u00a0Hawkins predicted President Trump would lose in a massive landslide and asked voters to vote for what they truly believe. Carroll demanded the protection of human dignity and support for the family as society's basic unit.\nAt the final debate held October 24 in , Wyoming, after opening statements, the candidates received ten questions on fairness in debates, veteran suicides, military propaganda, centralized control of technology, national sovereignty, the primary system, rank choice voting, ballot access laws, regulation of artificial intelligence, and the national debt. Chad \u00a0Peace of the Independent Voters Network, antiwar activist , Brian Anderson of Nexus, conspiracy theorist , Kaia Los Huertos of the National Association of Nonpartisan Reformers, Renaldo Pearson of , of \"\", and Tobin, each asked questions. Like the previous, the debate concluded with final statements from the candidates.\nWith Blankenship's absence, only four candidates took the stage. \u00a0In opening, La Riva called for an end to the capitalist system, and the cancellation of all rents and mortgages. \u00a0Pierce professed himself \"deeply concerned\" about the future of the US and endorsed using \"life\", \"liberty\", and \"happiness\" as the measure of success. \u00a0Hawkins renewed his support for the Green New Deal and an Economic Bill of Rights, and added a call for the abolition of nuclear weapons. \u00a0He noted that the is very close to midnight. Carroll argued that the US has the strength necessary to overcome all the problems it faces. \u00a0He found it curious he was called a \"Democratic socialist\" in one publication and yet received the endorsement of a writer for \".\nLike the previous debate, there was much agreement among the candidates. Pierce and Hawkins both argued for using ballot access as an inclusion standard for debates. \u00a0La Riva disagreed, stating that the Electoral College should be eliminated. She criticized the Top Two election policy in California and called for the \" decision to be overturned. Carroll also backed the overturn of \"Citizens United\". \u00a0Hawkins attacked the \"macho culture\" that idolizes the military while it fights to protect the interests of the upper class. Carroll recalled someone who went to fight in the \u00a0and returned changed. He wondered how the US can train people to be racist killers and then expect them to return to society. La Riva described the military as a \"horrible\" use of the working class. \u00a0She called the a \"genocidal war.\" \u00a0Pierce then explained he was an honorary ambassador in Korea. He longed for the reopening of the border between North and South Korea. \u00a0Pierce emphasized big tech censorship as a problem more than military propaganda. He argued that tech companies should either decide to be publishers or platforms. La Riva regarded technology under capitalism as problematic but said it would be beneficial under socialism. Pierce countered that technology is amoral and can be good or bad based on how it is used. \u00a0Hawkins argued that big tech is moving the nation in a democratic socialist direction. \u00a0Carroll argued for checks and balances for big tech and for a new level of government to regulate big tech. \u00a0La Riva then called for the expropriation of big tech companies and to let the US people decide how to use the parts. \u00a0Concerning national sovereignty, Pierce said he favored treaties over war and endorsed an audit of the . \u00a0Hawkins called for the nationalization of the Federal Reserve and expressed concern about the nation losing its sovereignty to corporations rather than other nations. La Riva agreed with the nationalization of the Federal Reserve. \u00a0Carroll argued that trade deals like have unforeseen consequences like pushing Mexican corn growers north of the border. Carroll also said he wanted to edit the to remove corporations from its protection. \u00a0Whereas Pierce and Hawkins all felt parties should decide the procedures for their own primaries, La Riva favored the system, arguing it is more democratic than Top Two. \u00a0Pierce claimed was the last third party candidate to be elected president and that he appointed a cabinet of rivals. \u00a0Pierce said he was embarrassed about the questions politicians asked to tech leaders, and argued the nation needs \"visionary leadership.\" \u00a0La Riva argued against (UBI), proposing be increased to US$20 an hour. \u00a0Carroll agreed with La Riva, saying that jobs are more important than UBI. \u00a0He named his economic view as , which he said was an extreme form of capitalism. \u00a0Hawkins claimed that as a currency issuers rather than a currency user, the US government has enough money to spend and that the debt and deficit does not matter. La Riva agreed, claiming there was enough wealth in the nation to pay for everyone's needs.\u00a0Carroll called on the US to end its involvement in foreign wars worldwide and to stop paying for wars on a credit card. \u00a0Pierce viewed the debt as an issue and that government has run out of control and tax reform is necessary.\nIn conclusion, Carroll explained that he is pro-life on all issues. He supported social justice and considered strong local \u00a0communities, strong small businesses, and strong families as fundamental. La Riva argued socialism is growing in popularity and private ownership is the real tyranny people live under. \u00a0Pierce emphasized the need for education across the nation and likened the current system to indoctrination. \u00a0Hawkins claimed the coronavirus pandemic shows the US is a \"failed state.\" \u00a0He urged voters to vote for what they want.\nFinal pleas.\n\"Wikinews\" provided an opportunity for three presidential candidates who did not participate in either of the Free and Equal Election debates to give their final plea to voters. \u00a0Those giving their final pleas are: Libertarian Party presidential nominee , Prohibition Party presidential nominee , and Unity Party of America presidential nominee Bill Hammons.\nJo Jorgensen.\nI'm counting on my libertarian and independent base because they know that I'm the real deal. \nTo dissatisfied Democrats stuck with a candidate who voted for more war and who wrote some of our most oppressive criminal justice laws, I say, \"There is a real party of peace and justice.\" The party that selects the author of draconian incarceration and a prosecutor who locked up thousands for victimless crime does not deserve your vote. To them, I say, \"Be Bold. Vote Gold.\"\nTo small-government Republicans who've watched out-of-control spending and fiat money creation, who rightly fear Venezuela-style inflation and economic collapse, I say, \"There is a real party of smaller government and individual responsibility.\" We can unshackle the market to create prosperity and opportunity, and we can reduce government by 75% without leaving anyone out in the cold. To fiscal conservatives, I say, \"Be Bold. Vote Gold.\"\nPhil Collins.\nMy final plea is telling voters that I remind people about the harmful effects of alcohol. I tell them that we care about other issues. We support a balanced budget. We're pro-life and pro-gun rights.\nBill Hammons.\nIt is highly possible that this election will be the first to be thrown to the House of Representatives in the modern era. The outlines that the top three finishers in the receive consideration for a House vote, and I would just need a handful of (or perhaps even just one) Electoral Vote(s) to be in the final running alongside two men who, not to put too fine a point on it, are walking National Security risks considering their health, age, and risk factors for a raging COVID-19 Pandemic. I ask voters to vote their conscience, because Presidential Electors are people too, and enough Hammons votes might convince enough Electors to also vote their conscience.\nPredictions.\n\"Wikinews\" asked three political pundits to give their predictions for the tally of the 2020 presidential election. The pundits were: former U.S. Congressman Tom Tancredo, who represented as a Republican; political blogger Thomas Knapp, who founded the |Boston Tea Party; and attorney Ron Gunzburger, founder and publisher of the elections website Politics1.com. \nTom Tancredo.\nIn addition to his time in Congress, Tancredo ran unsuccessfully for the Republican Party's 2008 presidential nomination.

We would also like to heartily thank our main website hoster Uberspace who is currently being sued in Germany for hosting our essentially business card website and who have already spent thousands of Euros in their legal defense.\"\nHours after GitHub restored the public access to the repository, Stoltz tweeted \"I think of youtube-dl as a successor to the videocassette recorder. The VCR empowered people to take control of their personal use of free-to-air video, but it had to be saved from the . The same goes for youtube-dl. GitHub did the right thing here.\"\nyoutube-dl is used by thousands of people around the world. Multiple Creative Commons-licensed and public domain videos on are uploaded via a tool called video2commons, which relies on youtube-dl to download media. youtube-dl also lets users download videos from \u2014 a video-sharing platform for citizen journalism. Videos downloaded using youtube-dl are also used for the purpose of fair use, or for evidence. \nWhen a copyright holder chooses to release their work, be it a photograph, a video, or audio, under a Creative Commons Attribution (CC BY) license, they allow everyone to freely own, share or modify the work as long as the reusers properly attribute the author of the work. YouTube also hosts many audio and video recordings in the public domain which can be used for any purpose without any restrictions.\nIn the blog post announcing \"youtube-dl is back\", GitHub said, \"Although we did initially take the project down, we understand that just because code can be used to access copyrighted works doesn't mean it can't also be used to access works in non-infringing ways. We also understood that this project's code has many legitimate purposes, including changing playback speeds for accessibility, preserving evidence in the fight for human rights, aiding journalists in fact-checking, and downloading Creative Commons-licensed or videos.\"\nGitHub also announced any new 1201 takedown notices will be \"carefully scrutinised by legal experts\" to reject \"unwarranted claims\", and said it will side with software developers if the claims are ambiguous. The announcement also mentioned GitHub Trust and Safety team would treat developer's as a \"top priority\". GitHub also pledged donation of USD 1 million for developer defense fund \"to help protect open source developers on GitHub from unwarranted DMCA Section 1201 takedown claims\".\nGitHub had blocked public access to many forks of youtube-dl upon receiving the DMCA notice in October. At that time, \"Wikinews\" noted public access was not yet restored for the forked repositories listed in RIAA's copyright notice and was still displays \"Repository unavailable due to DMCA takedown\".\nDuring the period when GitHub had disabled public access for the repository, Sergey M had been developing youtube-dl and hosting it on , another code-sharing and hosting site. However, since GitHub has restored public access of youtube-dl, Sergey M has made the GitLab repository private.\nAfter this, \"Wikinews\" reached out to Richard Stallman, the founder of Free Software Foundation, who has been highly critical of DRM (digital rights management, the subject of the DMCA) for many years now, to discuss the harms of DRM and DMCA 1201.\nInterview with Richard Stallman about the harms of DRM and DMCA 1201.\n What is DRM and whose rights [is] the DRM trying to protect?\n Well, DRM as I consider it, stands for digital restrictions management. It stands for system functionalities designed to restrict users in their use of copies of works. It's an injustice. It is a system of giving, generally, the more powerful additional power over everyone else. They [who implement DRM] like to say that this is a matter of protecting rights, but it's really a matter of protecting power. That power is an injustice and it should not exist.\n What do you think of the Recording Industries Association of America's DMCA take down notice against youtube-dl?\n Oh. Well it was, as I understand it, it was entirely a distortion of the law. And the Electronic Frontier Foundation explained why that was so. And I believe that's why GitHub put it back up again. But I'm more concerned with the morality of it than the legality of it. And basically it was a system\nof oppression. But that's what the DMCA was mainly there to achieve: Make it easier to repress.\n Why was the DMCA introduced?\n Well of course I don't \"know\" the motives. I can only try to guess. But in general, the bad things in the DMCA give more power to publishing companies and secondarily occasionally to authors and artists to stop people from sharing. Now that was visible here it was to stop people from sharing youtube-dl. But the DRM portions of the DMCA were designed to stop people from breaking the digital handcuffs that companies place on them.\nSo before 1998, companies tried implementing DRM and people who didn't like being handcuffed by DRM implemented ways to break the handcuffs. The DRM[...] the DMCA made that much more difficult and it's been followed by hardware designed to restrict the people who use it \u2014 the people who supposedly buy it \u2014 are forbidden to change the parts of it that are designed to restrict them.\n Is the existence of DRM necessary for the DMCA to serve its purpose?\n Well, if the purpose is to repress, then yes, the DMCA; a part of the DMCA: because the DMCA says many different things. So there are two parts of the DMCA that are pertinent here. There's the part that sets up the takedown system and then there's a part about DRM and forbidding the distribution of any equipment to break DRM. So you you better say which one you mean because there's so much else in the DMCA.\nThe large goal of the DMCA is basically to stop people from sharing. And both of those parts of the DMCA serve the purpose of stopping people from sharing. I believe sharing copies of published works should be lawful and any law designed to stop that \u2014 any law against that \u2014 is an attack on society.\nSo if the goal is to to divide people and stop them from sharing, well DRM certainly contributes to that goal.\n Is the DRM really harmful for an independent society \u2014 a society which is not controlled by a select few companies.\n Oh, well DRM tends to increase the control of certain areas of society by companies, and especially large companies. You see, a truly effective DRM scheme typically involves getting everyone to follow the same standard to restrict people so there are no exceptions. They need something like a monopoly. If there were effective competition \u2014 competition between systems and practices that are\ndiverse \u2014 then people would find ways to get copies without DRM. But what happens instead is a DRM conspiracy is set up whereby all the publishers start using \u2014 although they're supposedly competing and may in fact be competing in some other sense \u2014 in regard to their use of DRM, they're all the same. So just about everyone publishing recorded videos at one point switched to DVDs. The DVDs were designed to have DRM. It's all the same DRM system. And they were all basically the same player system.\nAnd it means that basically competition does people no good. You can't find a publisher that's publishing the same things but without DRM: they're all restricting you the same. So if you are completely firm in your hatred of DRM like me you say well I just won't buy any such thing. But if you're not so firm you'll probably surrender and go along with the restrictions of the system that they've switched to, which at that time meant DVDs. And then, because people had found ways to break the DRM of DVDs, another sort of monopolistic system for DRM was designed and that was . And you'll notice that all sorts of video publishing companies started publishing on Blu-ray discs. Well that was one single technical standard with the same DRM. And they all used the same DRM implementing disc players for Blu-ray discs. So they have a chance of success when they avoid competition. If there were enough competition, some publishers might start saying, \"Hey we'll publish without the DRM.\" My understanding is, you can't write a Blu-ray disc that doesn't have DRM. I've been told you can't make and sell Blu-ray discs that anyone can copy. That was one example of a change for the worst compared with DVDs. You can write DVDs that don't implement the DRM.\n What are some of the ways DRM mistreats the users without them actually knowing about it?\n Well, when DRM mistreats you, you'll notice. You know, if you can't copy the contents into a file on your disk you'll notice. So there are many malicious things that programs can do to users without users knowing for instance spying on users. It could have a . And unless you notice the use of the back door, you can't tell. But DRM is one thing that you can tell.\n How according to you should the laws concerning should be applied?\n I'm afraid that question is fundamentally confused by use of the vague over-generalisation \"intellectual property\". Are you talking about ?\n No, I'm talking law specifically for Intellectual Property Protection.\n Sorry, you don't understand. The term \"intellectual property\" is applied to many different kinds of laws. For instance, patent laws. When you ask that question whether you know it or not, you're asking about patent laws. That term is also commonly applied to trade secrecy. So whether you know it or not, your question is asking about law. And it's also applied to , which really just you know those are just names. And the trademark law just says what that you can register a trademark and then other people can't call their products by that name. So whether you knew it or not your question was asking about those laws too. There are also plant variety monopolies, which are not the same as patents, and you were asking about those laws too. And there is also copyright law. So whether you knew it or not, you were asking about copyright law. And there are others I don't even know what all of them are. Because there's so many and they're all different. And you were asking about all of those laws at once because you said \"intellectual property\".\nI recognised about 20 years ago that that term \"intellectual property\" reliably causes confusion because it asks about so many different laws at once and these laws are totally different; they apply to different areas; they have different purposes. They're designed to achieve different things but that term \"intellectual property\" treats them as if they were all minor variations of the same thing and they're not.\nSo every time you use that term, you're causing yourself to be confused and other people who think your question or statement is meaningful will get confused too. So I decided to reject that term completely because I want people to understand the differences between these various laws and they can't understand that until they realize that these laws are different.\nCan you try to make your question specific enough that I could answer it?\n There are a lot of complaints which try to hide behind these IP laws in order to protect the software. \n They hide behind the term \"intellectual property\" to prevent it from becoming clear which law they're talking about and what the issue is in the case. But actually to speak of \"protecting software\" there's another sneaky point there. What does it mean to \"protect software\"? Prevent it from being destroyed? Prevent it from being erased? Protect normally means \u2014 to something means \u2014 to stop it from being destroyed or damaged or ruined. So for instance, if somebody threatens to break a DVD, well a DVD of software, and you \"stopped\" the person from destroying the disk, that would be protecting software, right? That's protecting software by the usual meaning of the word \"protect\".\nWhen in that kind of question when they say protect, it's bogus. So I would say to them \"What do you mean by that? What exactly is the thing you're trying to stop?\" I would refuse to take up the intentionally confusing terminology like protect software. I would insist on getting a concrete description of what you're trying to do. And then I could give a concrete response do you want to give a concrete description? Of course you're quoting the others, you're not saying that this is your goal. You're talking about others who say that this is their goal. And if they're speaking gobbledygook, well you can't tell what they really mean. I'm saying that when they use that terminology they are basically confusing people.\nIt's gobbledygook. It's not a real question. And I would refuse to try to engage with their gobbledygook. I talk about concrete questions that I can describe like should anyone be able to stop you from making a copy of something. And if you want we can make it more concrete than that but you'll have to say which concrete case you mean. The point is I don't believe that anyone should have the power to stop you from making a copy to give to your friend or to somebody you just met. And if somebody wants to try to argue for that we should give that power, well the onus is on per to demonstrate why person should have that power.\n A person who paid for a tool owns it and is used to modify as they wish, for example you do not like the color of your chair, paint it if your car's tire is flat, change it or ask a mechanic to help you with that, except for cases where there is a computer and usually a software involved.\n Yeah. Well I think you should have the same freedom to change the software. And that relates to the issue of free ' or ' software. I have fought for free software because I believe all users who are running programs should have the freedom to change those programs or get someone else to help change them. And that's why I've developed free programs and released them to give other people that freedom. And that's why I refuse to run non-free programs because they subjugate their users by stopping the users from changing those programs. It means that the users don't have control of their own computing. I consider that unacceptable so I don't accept it. I simply say I won't use that non-free software, take it away.\n But why is computer software treated differently than other tools? For example, if we take case of John Deere tractors.\n Oh well, morally, it shouldn't be. Morally, all software should be free. Users should always get the source code and they should be able to change it and publish modified versions so that others can get the benefit of their changes.\nNow, I can tell you practically speaking why it is not treated the same way. It's because software was treated as a kind of written work. Written works were covered by copyright law. They generally were not tools of any sort, you looked at them. You didn't pick up a written work and turn something with it. Right it's not a tool in the same sense as a screwdriver is. And physical structures were treated legally different from collections of text which is what a program is. And so carrying forward those two existing practices, they ended up saying that programs were copyrighted and at this point the lobbying of the companies, some of which were already large in the 1980s, was enough to cause copyright law in the US to be interpreted in rather strange ways for software. For instance, companies started saying: this program is copyrighted and it's a trade secret. Now it used to be that copyright applied to published works and anything that's a secret is not published. If it were published it wouldn't be a secret anymore. But the companies lobbied and they were allowed to have it both ways. They could say the source code is a secret and the compiled executable is published. And so they could have the benefit of copyright law and trade secret law for the same work at the same time.\nNow, if the people writing the laws had been thinking based on what is in the public interest, they might have said that's absurd but they were thinking about \"how can I please these companies that will give me a job later. You know, once I'm not in office anymore, I want to get paid by companies\". So they did things to please the companies which probably told them, \"We'll have work for you later\". That system is known as the revolving door between business and government and it's fundamentally a form of corruption, even though it's not necessarily illegal. But morally speaking it's corruption.\nSo what we ended up with, well, so we ended up with software that was copyrighted and the source code was secret and thus the company had two ways to restrict the users of that program. One was they couldn't get the source code so they couldn't change it really except by patching the binary and that's hard to do: it's hard to make a very big change by patching the binary. And at the same time it was copyrighted so they were forbidden to redistribute it. And if they so if they managed to patch the binary they were not allowed to share that with anybody else. And so the users were helplessly under the power of that company. That was the situation in the early 80s which led me to develop free software and start the free software movement. And meanwhile non-free software led to DRM. You see, in order for a program that's intended to restrict users to succeed in restricting users, it has to be secret. Or else there has to be something that stops the users from changing it, and stops them in some other way. Because, you know, if someone puts some shackles on you and you can then change the shape of the shackles so you can take them off your feet, they're not really effective shackles, are they?\n You see this is rather odd that a car manufacturer never stops the users from opening the bonnet and expect what is underneath or even change it.\n Well yes, actually with software they do exactly that. And that's basically what John Deere is doing with the tractors. Because now there are computers in the car or the tractor and the computers are running software. The software is an important part of the car or the tractor and that's what the supposed owner can't change. So when you see that, you get to see the evil of non-free software and I don't think they should be allowed to sell cars with non-free software in them. I think that they should be required to make the software free so users can change the programs.\n What changes to the current system do you propose?\n Well, that's rather complicated. [T]he changes I propose in laws and the system of distributing for the legal system for publication. Basically I think all software should be free. Free as is in freedom of course. I don't mind if you charge money for a copy but the software that you distribute should always respect users freedom. However, I am against making it a crime to distribute a non-free program, simply because criminalising such things tends to fail to achieve its goal. I mean, look at for instance dangerous drugs, that it's a crime to sell but people just break those laws massively and meanwhile in the US hundreds of thousands of people, maybe more than a million are in prison for breaking those laws and yet people are still doing it in tremendous quantities. So that's the only reason I wouldn't want to make it a crime to distribute non-free software. But it shouldn't happen. For other kinds of works, however, we have to look at copyright and I would say that works that are meant to serve a practical purpose, such as textbooks, for instance, or reference works, they should all be free as in freedom also. However, for other kinds of works, such as artistic works and works of testimony, it's okay for those works to be copyrighted. But people should at least be allowed to non-commercially redistribute exact copies. So you should be allowed to be a good member of your community, which includes among other things making copies and sharing them.\nNow, if you have a copy of something and your friend says, \"hey could I have a copy of that?\", of course you will want to share a copy that's the friendly thing to do.\n What do you think of DRM actively trying to stop the right to repair?\n Well, the right to repair is basically a small part of the freedom that free software gives. So of course I support the right to repair and anything that works against it is wrong. But I would go much further in the right to repair. I would say the software in your car, your tractor or your radio or whatever it might be should be free software. And that basically, that provides the right to repair because it means that the users of the product can study how it works and they can extract the knowledge needed to do the repairs and share that knowledge, you know write it down, publish it and that way all the users of the product will be able to repair it.\n What do you think of the companies today leasing their products or services as per the EULA and abusing DMCA and DRM to prevent the consumers from having control of the things they own?\n [L]easing a product; if a company leases a product to you then you don't own it, however I would say that if you have the possession of the product for the long term, that's enough reason why the software in it should be free. So you should be free to change that software. Of course, maybe someday you terminate the lease and you return the product and they probably will restore the standard software inside it before they lease it to someone else.\n When I say product/services I meant the so-called software-as-a-service.\n Oh, software-as-a-service \u2014 it's too vague a term to mean anything. It's of interest perhaps to businesses for thinking about their strategies, but in terms of how they're treating customers it's too vague, it doesn't mean anything.\n I could call it service-as-a-software-substitute.\n Oh that's different, you see, though. That is a much more specific term. It doesn't cover as many different cases and that's why I use it because it's more specific, it's narrow enough that I can say something coherent about it. I can't really say anything about \"software-as-a-service\" because it's too broad, it's too varied. Service-as-a-software-substitute I can say something about because it is less varied. It means that the service consists of running a certain program for you. And my response is don't let someone else run it for you, run it yourself. If it's a free program and you run it yourself, you have control over it and that's the way it should be. If it's a free program, but you pay someone else to run it for you, then you don't really get control over what that program is doing, because it's running in a someone else's computer.\nOf course, if it's a non-free program then even if you run it yourself you don't really have control. You don't have control over what it does, but you have more control if you were running it than if someone else is running it.\n So what do you mean when you say you own a copy of a software?\n Well, with free software, when you get a copy, you own it the same way you could own a chair. You buy a chair you own it. With a free software you buy a copy you own it. But with, say consider, for instance, some software package you might think that you're buying a copy, but the company will say you don't own it, you just have a license to run it under limited terms. Well I think that is mistreatment of the public. That's part of the reason why I won't ever use that software.\n [T]alking about software, what are the set of rights an owner of a software must have?\n What do you mean by owner of a program? Do you mean the developer, do you mean a user?\n Anybody who bought the software.\n Okay, so first of all, well, I would say since we're talking about the user of a program, that software should be free. And that means that the user, any user, gets the four essential freedoms: Freedom zero is the freedom to run the program however you wish for whatever purpose you have in mind. Freedom one is the freedom to study the source code of that program so they've got to give you the source and then change it so it functions the way you wish. Freedom two is the freedom to make exact copies and then give or sell them to others and freedom 3 is the freedom to make copies of your modified versions and give or sell them to others.\n You talk about reselling. Now it is completely okay if I had to resell a vehicle. But in case, if it came with a software, let's take example of Tesla.\n Oh well please be careful. You're using the term resell which is not a term I used. What I said is the freedom to make copies and then give the or sell those copies to others. Now that's not reselling in the usual sense of that word. Because what I'm talking about involves making more copies. With a free program, you have the right to copy it and give or sell the copies. You also have with a free program you have the right to change the code and then copy that and give or sell copies.\nSo this is a rather firm stand. It's not the same thing as you bought a car and you sell the same car to somebody else.\n Should that right also be protected for the free software. If I get a copy of the software, should I be allowed to give that copy to someone else permanently? Let's say I bought it on a DVD and I would give that DVD to someone else, me not having the copy at all.\n Well, that I expect is lawful nowadays although there are some that will try to make you sign a contract and won't let users get copies without that. And that is an additional level of oppression. But I'm going far beyond that. I'm not just saying you should be allowed to resell the same copy. I'm saying you should have the freedom to copy it to, make more copies.\n So while we are speaking about selling the exact the copy itself now consider this the Amazon Kindle. It comes with the account tied to the Amazon account. If I were to give it to someone else the books would not transfer.\n Well, that's one of the injustices of DRM. This is one of the reasons I would never use an Amazon eBook, and I never have. No company should know what books you have. No company should be able to stop you from giving those books or selling those books to someone else. And if the book is digital, that means it is possible to copy it so no company should be able to stop you from non-commercially copying and redistributing those books. If you have a book and I would like a copy of it and you wish to copy it, you should be allowed to copy it for me. You shouldn't have to, but if you feel like to, you know it might be a lot of trouble and you'd say \"I'm sorry, I'm too busy\", but if you want to do it and suppose it's easy, then you should be allowed to do it. So I'm not just against the specific method, which is DRM, I'm against the goal that [it] is ostensibly meant to achieve \u2014 that goal shouldn't be achieved by anything. People should be free to share.\n Why do you think the EULA exists?\n Oh, well you mean why do companies impose EULAs on programs. Well they want to restrict people. They're trying to subjugate users. They have many ways of doing that. I have never agreed to any EULA.\n You know the analogy that I prefer for DRM is think of a car that you just purchased. The seller tells you that 'if it breaks down, come bring it to me and I'll fix it for you'. One day you realise that it's not working. Turns out the exhaust pipe has some blockage in it and if you try to fix that now the seller tells you, \"just because you did that now not only I'm not going to fix if the car breaks down I won't even let others fix it for you\".\n I would say I don't think they are similar. They're not really analogous. I would say that restriction on a car is comparable to the restrictions on proprietary software regardless of DRM. You know any non-free program because typically it's impossible for you to fix it because they don't give you the source code. Even if you are an authorised user, you can't have the source code for most non-free programs. The source code's not released at all. So you can't fix it yourself. Now these various situations they're related but they're not closely analogous. They're not the same thing going on in these different fields. They're often somewhat different and both evil but not in exactly the same way.\n How has the software distribution changed over the decade specifically in the rights that the users had?\n Well, non-free software started to exist in the 1960s at least maybe in the 1950s. But in the 1970s free software almost ceased to exist \u2014 all the software with small exceptions was proprietary, non-free. And it was in the 1980s that I launched the attempt to re-establish free software and to liberate users.\n What are the problems with the DMCA 1201 which is circumvention of copyright protection [measures]?\n Well that basically the worst part of that is the complete prohibition on distributing things that \u2014 tools that can break DRM. So for instance, anything that could access the video on a DVD or a BluRay disc is forbidden unless some company gives permission for it. I'm not sure which company is allowed to give permission for it. But basically you can't get permission for that so it has to be an underground device, one that is circulated without permission \u2014 a forbidden tool.\n What are the modifications that you would propose for the DMCA laws regarding anti-circumvention?\n I would eliminate them entirely. I might make \u2014 I might go further, yeah, I would go further and say that making or selling or leasing or importing what is it making, importing, selling, or leasing any product with DRM is a crime.\n Is the Free Software Foundation, SF Conservancy and the Electronic Frontier Foundation aware of and working with any senator to sponsor a bill [for these changes]?\n I don't know what those other organisations are doing. I don't think the Free Software Foundation has contacts so high in government. You know, opposition to anti-circumvention existed around 20 years ago but it mostly got crushed what happens is most people will not continue to oppose the law once it has existed for some number of years. It's too easy for people to say \"well we lost that one, now what battle are we gonna fight?\" But people like me, we never give up.\nDRM is evil and since I will never accept a copy of anything with the DRM, I have to fight against DRM.\n What are some of the ways a digital publisher can sell copyrighted works...?\n The words you are using, I will not accept. I'm not going to answer that question because to do it I would have to accept the concept of piracy and the concept of protected and I will not. I refuse to use them. When people, when they say piracy what they mean is sharing. It's a smear term to insult people who share. I will not smear sharing. I think sharing is good and stopping people from sharing is evil. Now I when they say protected, what they really mean is restricting. And I think that's bad. However I am in favor of supporting artists better. The existing system changes so as to support artists less and less. Now this has become a scandal in the field of music as the streaming disservices pay musicians so little when streaming their music that the musicians are basically going broke. What this shows by the way is the hypocrisy of the copyright system which ostensibly exists to support the artists. But in fact it supports businesses that screw the artists.\nWell, instead of trying to fix that system I say let's replace it and in the article in the page I told you about \u2014 copyright versus community, I propose two different two alternative systems to support artists. So take a look at it.\n How should artists and publishers who sell their art (music, artwork, literature) in a digital form sell it without imposing DRM, without worrying about one individual paying for it, an redistributing it to a larger audience, non-commercially?\n You must accept that people will do this, because it would be wrong to try to stop them.\n How do you think the browsers are affected by implemented by w3c allowing EMEs [Encrypted Media Extensions] to exist?\n You mean allowing DRM in browser? Well, basically what that means is free browsers cannot support the entire web standards. The DRM is something that only non-free browsers can do. So you have to decide do you want freedom or do you want to surrender to DRM and access the DRM covered works. For me the choice is clear. I won't accept a copy of a DRM infected work. But the danger is that is will we be able to keep free browsers going at all.\n I believe in the announcements Mozilla mentioned how they had to choose between either supporting DRM or otherwise giving up on their[...]\n Yeah, well that's basically that's how these schemes are set up. Most users don't understand freedom. They have superficial short-term desires. They want to get copies. So if a conspiracy of publishers \u2014 and that's effectively what it was all, people don't like to think of it that way \u2014 if a conspiracy of publishers says \"we're all going to publish using this scheme to restrict you, so if you want to get anything from of the kind of work that we publish DRM will be your only way\", people will say all right we'll accept the DRM. And then they push browser developers like Firefox and stores and so on into handling the DRM subjugated tools and products except for people like me who say, \"No thanks, I don't want any of those at all ever\".\n Was the rather too late to prevent [damages of DRM]?\n I'm afraid so. I'm afraid so. Although of course, we don't know what would have happened if history had been different. You can only speculate about that.\n Is there any scenario where DRM is morally justifiable?\n Not that I can imagine. The users should be, first of all DRM means non-free software designed to stop people from doing things with copies of published works. I don't think users should be stopped from copying and changing and sharing published works. For art, they don't have to. I don't think users have to be permitted to distribute modified versions. But they must be permitted to non-commercially share copies and DRM always prohibits that.\n Are you aware of and that are used to install applications [on GNU/Linux]?\n I've heard of it and I know that they can be used to install non-free software which of course it's foolish to do. You shouldn't trust a non-free program. But yes you can install non-free software. That has always been true and the reason is with free software ultimately you can do whatever you want. There's no way to stop you. So a free operating system always permits you to install non-free programs.\n The applications, which would otherwise be available in the distribution repository. Now, the software developers are just moving towards...\n That's a bad thing. That's a bad thing. It's a foolish thing. It's hard to trust these snaps and flatpaks. And not only that, but those platforms distribute non-free software, so it's a bad idea to point to them at all. And in addition, it means that there aren't multiple -- you know with with distributions, as distributions package a program they will look at the program and thus they can fix things, if they see anything bad they can change it. And thus, this is part of how users collectively maintain their control. I've never installed a snap or a flatpak. And I don't think I want to. I wouldn't. I don't trust it. How do I know whether that flatpak includes some non-free software. How could I check? I don't think they're designed to let people check. They're not designed for anyone to be able to build the program. As far as I know, I could be mistaken but if all everybody does is just install the binaries, in the flatpak. Nobody's building it, how does anybody know if the complete source is available."}

At least five of the nine CentOS Governing Board listed on the project are Red Hat employees. \nStarted in 2004, CentOS has been a free-of-cost free/libre open source software which provided with Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) \u2014 Red Hat's paid operating system. CentOS was absorbed into Red Hat in 2014, with Red Hat gaining the trademark rights of \"CentOS\".\nRed Hat also sponsors the operating system. Red Hat even gives the software engineering interns laptops with Fedora on it. Till now, software development took place on Fedora, which was later adopted in RHEL, which the Red Hat maintained and provided support for, for those customers who had RHEL subscription. CentOS would then follow RHEL to provide the same features free of cost, but without the support.\nStream was announced in September 2019, just two months after Red Hat was acquired by IBM. CentOS Stream's development cycle had new features added to it before the features became a part of RHEL. Stream receives more frequent updates, however, it does not follow RHEL's release cycle.\nWith CentOS Stream, developments from the community and the Red Hat emplyees would take place beforehand on both Fedora, and Stream as a , before those features are absorbed into RHEL. CentOS followed the release cycle of RHEL and therefore it was a stable distribution. Features available in CentOS were tried and tested by Fedora, and then RHEL maintainers. Stream, on the other hand, has features added to it before those features become a part of RHEL. That implies Stream would be ahead of RHEL's development, containing new features which are not yet tried and tested by RHEL developers, and not be binary code-compatible with RHEL.\nWriting \"The future of CentOS Linux is CentOS Stream\", Wright further wrote in the announcement, CentOS Stream \"provides a platform for rapid innovation at the community level but with a stable enough base to understand production dynamics.\" Wright also said, \"CentOS Stream isn't a replacement for CentOS Linux; rather, it's a natural, inevitable next step intended to fulfill the project's goal of furthering enterprise Linux innovation.\"\nSince the announcement was made, many people expressed their anger on (IRC), Reddit and CentOS project's mailing list. CentOS 8's End of Life (EOL) has been moved up from May 2029 to December 31, 2021, while CentOS 7 is expected to receive maintenance updates through June 2024, outliving CentOS 8.\nGregory Kurtzer, who had started the CentOS project, announced a new operating system, Rocky Linux. Rocky Linux describes itself as \"a community enterprise Operating System designed to be 100% bug-for-bug compatible with Enterprise Linux\". The project said \"Rocky Linux aims to function as a downstream build as CentOS had done previously, building releases after they have been added to the upstream vendor, not before.\" The project maintainers have not decided a date for when the operating system will be released.\nKurtzer explained the reason to call the OS as Rocky Linux: \"Thinking back to early CentOS days... My cofounder was Rocky McGaugh. He is no longer with us, so as a H/T [] to him, who never got to see the success that CentOS came to be, I introduce to you...Rocky Linux\".\n\"Wikinews\" reached out to the members of the CentOS project, Pablo Greco and Rich Bowen, to discuss this move, its implications as well as the future of CentOS. Greco is a maintainer of (32-bit processors) and is a part of the CentOS' team. Bowen \u2014 who unlike Greco, works for Red Hat \u2014 is the community manager of the CentOS project.\nInterview with the CentOS team.\n Can you tell me about your current role in the CentOS development, and how did you get involved with the project?\n I'm the armhfp maintainer, basically helping out fixing things that are not part of the Red Hat supported architectures. I do help out with other things like secondary , and creating images for armhfp and . I got involved not too long ago when a project that I was working on needed to use ARMv7 hardware, and although CentOS had a version, it wasn't complete.\n I'm Rich Bowen and I'm the Community Manager for the CentOS project. That means that it's my job to help people get involved in the project, manage the social media and newsletters (the \"voice\" of the project), and generally work with the community. I've been at Red Hat for almost 8 years, and during that time have worked in this capacity with a couple of other projects, too. I've been dedicated to the CentOS Project for going on 3 years now. And I've been doing stuff for about 25 years now.\nI should also note that I'm not alone \u2014 either on this team, or in responding to these questions. I have a team of colleagues who help me out with CentOS through the Open Source Program Office (OSPO) at Red Hat, and across the many other departments that are part of the / (RHEL)/ projects at Red Hat.\nThere's also a number of colleagues looking over my shoulder as I write this response, to ensure that I get the story straight. As a community manager, I'm not the technical expert on all the things, and so I need that support to get the details right in some of your questions.\n What is the relationship between CentOS and RHEL?\n CentOS started as an external project, that was acquired by Red Hat 7 or 8 years ago. But I don't think that it counts as an answer. I think you'll get a better answer from people from Red Hat.\n In many ways, it's the same as it's always been, but with a different end result and project structure. This is a community-focused open source project that delivers a strong Linux distribution foundation where non-operating-system focused (\"layered\") open source projects can develop, test, and innovate. For example, and .\nThe main shift with this evolution of a focus on is how it is developed in the open, in the community space, allowing contributors to get involved in the creation and shaping of the future. This also means RHEL users, customers, partners, independent hardware/software vendors, and anyone else can participate in the future of RHEL in true open source fashion.\nIn the past, the relationship between Fedora, RHEL, and CentOS was effectively, \"Fedora gets snapshot every so many years, then RHEL engineers develop RHEL behind closed doors until release day, then the RHEL source code is released, then CentOS would take the RHEL source and rebuild.\" While that is an oversimplification, it is essentially accurate. Now the new structure is, \"Fedora gets snapshot every so often and becomes the basis for the next CentOS Stream release, then development happens in the open with community contribution involvement and influence, and then RHEL rebases frequently on CentOS Stream.\"\nThis moment of integration is called \"the development phase\" in the RHEL engineering process. This is being misinterpreted as a \"beta\". Rather, this is an aspect of a distribution that is continuously delivered.\nThis is not software that is untested and not considered ready for inclusion in RHEL. It is already planned for the next RHEL release, has passed QA [quality assurance] and [Continuous Integration] checks, and is considered stable. In the past, this software went right into RHEL without external visibility. We don't schedule software for inclusion into RHEL unless it has been used/tested/integrated at other levels (such as Fedora), and is considered stable enough for inclusion. This same philosophy will still be at play with CentOS Stream.\nOne thing I would like to highlight here is this is the first time in the history of RHEL that development happens in the open and allows for collaboration and contribution from the broader open source community. That is a large goal of CentOS Stream and we're making the move to focus on that entirely.\nFor an example of where this evolution has been discussed in the past, this presentation from Fedora's Flock 2018 \"The Penrose Triangle\" shows how this problem has been discussed and worked through for a number of years now.\n How has CentOS evolved after Red Hat acquired it? How has it evolved since IBM acquired Red Hat last year?\n The biggest change when CentOS came to Red Hat was that individuals who were working on CentOS in their weekends and evenings now had the ability to devote more time to it.\nIn addition, the project for the first time was able to put significant resources on helping make the platform useful for open source software development of other projects in Red Hat's ecosystem. This included the expansion of the SIG program [Special Interest Groups] to include layered projects like , and .\nIBM is not involved in the CentOS community or Red Hat's work in it. An unfortunate misconception about this announcement has been conspiracy theories about IBM's involvement in this decision. Red Hat operates independently from IBM, and IBM had no influence or involvement in the decision.\n What are the similarities between CentOS, Fedora and RHEL?\n I'm gonna explain in a really loose way, ok? Fedora is where everything starts, all the fast moving packages. Some maintained by Red Hat employees, some by contributors. Every few years, Red Hat gets sort of a snapshot of Fedora, and starts stabilizing and improving it, and that becomes RHEL. CentOS originally was a rebuild of that.\nAbout 1 year ago, Stream was introduced, as a way to make the work around RHEL more public, allowing the users to contribute. Making it sort of a continuous preview of what's to come for RHEL. That doesn't imply anything about it being of lower quality by definition, or some like some people call it. Many of the packages that are built for stream, reach the next version of RHEL unmodified. So even if there is a higher level of testing in Stream, it is far from a traditional .\n They are each Linux distribution projects, which work on a common code base at different points in its life. It's born in an open source project, and travels through each of the projects as it matures.\nFrom a community perspective, the projects are each run as open, collaborative communities, but with different audiences. By the time we get to RHEL, it's done inside Red Hat, but that team also operates with the principles of open source.\nThe exciting thing about CentOS Stream is that it makes RHEL development more open, both in terms of decision making, and in who can participate. We're believers in the Four Opens, as the OpenStack community talks about them here \u2014 https://governance.openstack.org/tc/reference/opens.html\nOur roots are in open source, but that's not enough without the other three.\n What are the similarities and differences between CentOS and CentOS Stream? Or do they just share the name and are completely different?\n For me, Stream is not CentOS, Stream is the next RHEL, the rest is just branding.\n The name \"CentOS\" is frequently misused, and has been for a long time, so here are the basics: CentOS is the project. CentOS Linux is a rebuild of Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL). CentOS Stream is an upstream distribution from RHEL, which reflects what the RHEL team intend to put into the next minor release of RHEL. The CentOS Project also contains other things, such as the SIGs (Special Interest Groups), the Promo/Events team, the CI/CD and build system (CBS) project, and so on.\n Do you have any stats for the userbase of CentOS vs Stream?\n I don't, but Stream is rather new so I don't expect the number to be that big. I've been using Stream for most of my things ever since it came out, and I love the idea for it. The only problem is that Stream is being used as an excuse to kill CentOS, and that's the part I hate.\n We don't. For reasons of privacy, we have never kept server logs around CentOS Linux, and other CentOS Project \"downloads.\" And these files are served by a large network distributed around the world, much of which we don't have any actual access to.\nI put the word downloads in quotes, because installing a Linux distribution isn't exactly just downloading something. It's composed of thousands of packages which are (can be) installed independently, and figuring out which of those packages are going to CentOS Stream machines, vs CentOS Linux machines (vs machines, and so on) and which ones are being mirrored for further use by additional users behind a firewall, is a lot of guesswork.\nWe have some general ideas, but have always been reluctant to try to put actual numbers on it, because of these reasons and others. Linux user surveys [...] perhaps have a better handle on this than we do, since we have simply never gathered these stats.\n Could you briefly explain what Red Hat announced and what it means for the future of CentOS?\n They announced that the CentOS as we all know it, doesn't exist anymore, there's only Stream from now on. This applies to all releases starting with [CentOS] 8, [CentOS] 7 seems to be unaffected by this. In my view, CentOS is dead, there is no CentOS anymore, because as I said, I view Stream as a RHEL thing and not a CentOS thing.\n Could you briefly explain Chris Wright's announcement, and what it means for the future of CentOS?\n The future of CentOS is stronger than ever, as it is now literally in the critical path of RHEL development. The CentOS Project as a community continues, and in fact the community grows more facets as CentOS Stream provides more ways where the community can engage with Red Hat and each other. There will be some growing pains as users of CentOS Linux find out and help shape whether CentOS Stream meets their needs. Communities are built in overcoming challenges together, and there are many challenges ahead in making CentOS Stream right for members of the CentOS community.\nA major aspect of this is that in the past, CentOS Linux users could not shape the future of the distro within the project. From now on, not only developers but end users of all types will be able to shape the future of the distro. If CentOS Stream does not meet a user's need today, now they can advocate and contribute toward it meeting their needs as it evolves.\n Did Red Hat speak with the CentOS core developer team about this plan?\n I don't have a contractual relation with Red Hat, just as many of the people that helped in the CentOS-QA team. I assume that those who are knew about this, but the rest of us didn't. But this is all my assumption, don't have any evidence one way or the other.\n Did Red Hat speak with the CentOS core developer team about this plan? Were there any oppositions within Red Hat about this decision? Was it put to vote?\n Red Hat discussed this with the CentOS Governing Board, which is responsible for the oversight of the CentOS Project. There was a lot of back-and-forth on that proposal. The CentOS Governing Board voted and reached consensus.\nRed Hat's engineering resource focus has never been decided by voting. Some of the core developers are on the Governing Board but not everyone in our community was involved in the decision. As I'll touch on later in this interview, that's one of the reasons that some of the community have taken this change so hard.\nIs every Red Hatter happy with the announcement? Of course not. A big part of Red Hat's culture is the ability to voice an opinion and ask hard questions. And Red Hatters have definitely expressed their thoughts about this.\n Do you know why this sudden move from Red Hat?\n No idea, I can assume it was a business decision, but no information whatsoever.\n CentOS Stream was introduced in September 2019, so while the news may have come as a surprise to many, Red Hat has also had that time to get feedback on CentOS Stream and see momentum that reinforced the role it believed CentOS Stream could fit in the RHEL ecosystem. I've seen Red Hat's VP of Linux Engineering explain the timing internally \u2014 once Red Hat took the decision to the CentOS Governing Board and the Board had voted, they all thought it was important and most transparent for the community leadership to communicate that decision as soon as possible. \n Why has the End of Life [EOL] been shortened?\n Good question, I don't have an answer for it. I guess someone from Red Hat should give you that. I'm not happy about it to say the least.\n Why has the EOL been shortened? Is this unusual?\n First, it's important to understand that the dates that the CentOS project lists as EOL (End Of Life) dates are, and always have been, dependent on Red Hat. That is, we can say that CentOS Linux 7 will be EOL on a particular date, but if the dates around RHEL 7 shift, hypothetically speaking, then so will those around CentOS Linux 7. That's what happened with CentOS Linux 8. This decision was made by Red Hat and the CentOS Board. \n What are some of the reasons people consider CentOS for their daily driver or for their servers?\n It used to be rock solid distribution, with almost everything that RHEL has, but without all the hassle or the costs of a RHEL license, and obviously without the main benefit of RHEL which is the support. CentOS 7 still fits that description.\n Besides the obvious cost benefits of running CentOS Linux, many users find that the friction of running CentOS Linux is much lower than other options. There's no web form, registration, or subscription management. And while these frictions are things that the RHEL subscription team is actively working on, this remains part of our users' mindset.\n How different are CentOS 7 and CentOS 8?\n Upgrades between major release versions provide a chance to provide the latest versions of packages to our users. A major release will stay on these base package versions for the releases' lifecycle. The \"rebasing\" of packages allows us to incorporate all of the fixes and enhancements that have occurred between major releases and ensure we maintain the balance of upstream momentum, with the stability that backporting patches and fixes provides.\n In some ways, very different, Modularity may be the biggest, many new versions of things (there was a 5 year gap between 7 and 8). But for the most part, usage is the same as it has been forever, like in things like repos [repositories], installing and removing packages, building packages, etc.\n Would it be feasible for the developers to fork CentOS 8 after EOL, to continue developing the OS?\n We've actually covered this in the FAQ that we published on Tuesday. The short answer is yes, and we fully expect that to happen. Indeed, the Rocky Linux project has already indicated their intention to do just that. \nThere's also ongoing discussion on the CentOS Project mailing lists of how this could be done within the community itself.\n Very, to me the most difficult part of coming up with a new fork is the human factor. The technical side may have its complications (many to mention), but at the end of the day, they are solvable.\n Will Red Hat employees be barred from contributing to any community-driven development of forks of CentOS?\n A large part of Red Hat's culture is ingrained in the idea of open source and community. Red Hat will never prevent its employees from pursuing upstream development and open source projects. \nI think section 6 [of Red Hat's Open source participation guidelines] \"Contributing to upstream projects not maintained by Red Hat\" applies here. \n What are the implications of this move for the userbase?\n Where to start? There are too many cases in the userbase to mention, but taking some examples. If you have a fast deploying platform (like the Facebook example given in the press release), and you take advantage of the benefit of Stream even with the shortened EOL, this may not even affect you. But in my opinion, this is not the majority. Most users wanted CentOS for its premise of being bug-for-bug compatible with RHEL, and since that option doesn't exist anymore, until a suitable replacement appears, things are going to be complicated. I guess I could extend this by a lot, but that's the gist.\nDepending on your use case, you may be unaffected, or have a really complicated year ahead of you. I think very few people will be unaffected.\n Is the success of Stream somehow responsible for this move?\n In my opinion, no. The need for Stream to succeed maybe, but I just don't see Stream succeeding under the new conditions.\n Is the success of CentOS Stream somehow responsible for this? In the announcement, Wright said Stream was not the replacement for CentOS. What is the possible solution for those who relied on CentOS? \n CentOS Stream is not a drop-in replacement for all existing use cases. It requires sysadmins out there to evaluate the new information and adjust their workflows. We would do our user base a disservice to claim otherwise. For many use cases it can be used as a replacement. Indeed, for people who wanted the stability of the CentOS Linux base operating system, but were frustrated by the slowness of application updates, CentOS Stream will be a better replacement for CentOS Linux \u2014 now those updates will be available sooner, should users choose to update.\nWe also want people to understand the difference, so they can see the additional options it brings to them. We want people to go into this decision with eyes open, and not expect it to be something that it's not.\n What can be done for those users for whom CentOS Stream does not meet their requirements?\n Pay for RHEL, move to another distribution, or wait for someone to fill in the gap. If someone has another solution, I'm all ears.\n We hope any users who are in that situation will tell us, so we can figure out how to fix that failing. One of the exciting things about the move to CentOS Stream is it's designed to be an actual contributor community, rather than the legacy CentOS Linux that is almost entirely a consumer community.\nCentOS Stream is more than just something you download and install. It's a process and a community \u2014 a venue for contributing changes, making suggestions, and reporting bugs. All of that feeds back into making CentOS Stream better, and, in turn, making RHEL better.\nThat said, Red Hat is working on some \"low- or no-cost programs\" for users who cannot, for whatever reason, deploy CentOS Stream in their environment. This is discussed in the Red Hat announcement and we anticipate hearing more details around that in the coming weeks. \n What are some of the best arguments in favour of, and against this move that you are aware of?\n I have nothing positive to say about the announcement, let's just leave it at that. [About against the move,] I can't put it into words you can publish.\n While I empathize with users' response to the decision, I believe that shifting focus to CentOS Stream is the right solution for our community, in the longer term.\nCentOS Stream creates a place where the community can actually participate in the development of the OS on which they rely. They can now actually file bugs against it and have those considered by the engineering team. They can submit their own changes to the project and expect that they will actually be considered and accepted into the code.\nThe arguments against it have been made eloquently elsewhere, and if I can summarize them, they would be timing (dropping the announcement right on the heels of the CentOS 6 Linux EOL) and timing (cutting the maintenance lifetime of CentOS Linux 8 from 10 years to 2).\n How will this move affect the development of RHEL, and other GNU/Linux?\n RHEL maintainers try to do as much work as possible \"upstream first\". This means starting in upstream open source projects like the kernel, then participating in Fedora, then bringing those changes in for RHEL. CentOS Stream gives RHEL maintainers a place to collaborate with the community in public on what's coming for the next minor release. \n I don't think this will affect other distros in a negative way, quite the contrary. With respect to RHEL development, depends on how much people contribute to Stream. If people contribute to it, it will make RHEL a better product, because it will have a broader testing in the earlier stages. But that's just the benefit of stream. I mean, this was still true before the announcement.\n Will the maintainers appoint some new maintainers (not necessarily Red Hat employees) to see some development? Can the current maintainers continue to work on CentOS in their spare time?\n As far as I understand, no. CentOS is a of Red Hat, so anything would have to be done on the outside. But I'm not a lawyer, and I think you should get a formal answer to that from someone who represents Red Hat.\n What does the strong reaction from the CentOS community indicate?\n For me it indicates that Red Hat didn't expect this, or that they did expect it and were prepared to handle it. I don't like any of the options.\n What is the reason for such a strong reaction from the CentOS community? Had Red Hat considered this while making this move? How are they planning to handle it?\n Open source communities are often very passionate about their projects. The very nature of open source means that each person has equal ownership of the project. So the strong reaction here is understandable. A decision was made outside of their view, which they would not have made themselves. That makes people feel betrayed. We get that.\nAnd, yes, we discussed, in the leadup to this, how it would affect people, and that they would be angry. We tried to minimize that, but we understand community skepticism about that statement. It's a big change, being made quickly, and driven by business needs that the majority of our user community doesn't know or particularly care about.\nI've talked in other places about the stages of grief. The community has lost something, and they are grieving that. Part of that process is anger. This is neither unexpected nor strange in any way.\nWe also understand that this explanation rings hollow to some, and sounds like, \"We considered that and then decided to ignore it.\" That's not the case, but we understand why some people feel that it is.\nHow are we planning to handle it? By ensuring that CentOS Stream lives up to our promises by doing rather than talking. I'm here, as the community manager, to help people find the solutions that they need, and to help them navigate this period of transition. \n How many core developers are there, who are not working for Red Hat?\n The CentOS QA team which handles most of the day-to-day things, are about 20 people, most of which are not Red Hat employees, like myself.\n How do you think Fedora now fits in the grand scheme of Red Hat development?\n Fedora is still the upstream for whatever comes to RHEL, and is where most of the big changes happen. So in my opinion, Red Hat needs a stable and vibrant Fedora.\n Many users are calling it \"The death of CentOS\". Do you agree with that? Will the maintainers appoint some new maintainers (not necessarily Red Hat employees) to see some development? Can the current maintainers continue to work on CentOS in their spare time?\n No, obviously I do not agree that this is the death of CentOS. As I said earlier, CentOS is a project with multiple outputs, and the remaining outputs are still important both to CentOS users and to Red Hat. The project continues, it just looks different now, with a different primary focus.\nThat said, we totally understand community members who feel that we have killed the part of the project that they care about, and that, to them, this means the death of the project. That's not confusing or surprising at all.\nIn the coming year, we hope to demonstrate that CentOS Stream is every bit as useful, to most of our users, as CentOS Linux was. And for the users for whom it is \"not\" as useful, we will strive to understand why, and whether we can address that gap.\nThe very first sentence of my blog post on Tuesday was \"The future of the CentOS Project is CentOS Stream.\" Clearly that implies that I don't believe that this is the end of the line, or the death of the project. Our job going forward is to demonstrate the value of CentOS Stream, and build the contributor community around it.\n How can an open source project ensure situations like these do not repeat?\n Wish I knew, maybe not letting for-profit companies dictate the future of non-profit organizations/distributions. Unfortunately, I don't think I'm equipped to solve that :(\n All projects in the open source ecosystem are unique and face unique challenges. We would not presume to try to predict how to anticipate another project's issues."}

Gregory Kurtzer told \"Wikinews\" he started CAOS Linux around the time when Red Hat announced for their in favour of subscription-based Red Hat Enterprise Linux. CAOS was succeeded by CentOS when Rocky McGaugh, a developer of CAOS rebuilt the source code of RHEL to provide a monetarily free alternative. CentOS was absorbed into Red Hat in 2014, with Red Hat gaining the trademark rights of \"CentOS\".\nRed Hat also sponsors the development of the operating system. Until now, software development took place on Fedora, which was later adopted in RHEL, which the Red Hat maintained and provided support for, for those customers who had RHEL subscription. CentOS would then follow RHEL's release cycle to provide the same features free of cost, but without the support.\nStream was announced in September 2019, just two months after Red Hat was acquired by IBM. CentOS Stream's development cycle had new features added to it before the features became a part of RHEL. Stream receives more frequent updates, however, it does not follow RHEL's release cycle. \nWith CentOS Stream, developments from the community and the Red Hat employees would take place beforehand on both Fedora, and Stream as a , before those features are absorbed into RHEL. CentOS followed the release cycle of RHEL and therefore it was a stable distribution. Features available in CentOS were tried and tested by Fedora, and then RHEL maintainers.\nRed Hat's Chief Technical Officer Chris Wright wrote in the announcement \"CentOS Stream isn't a replacement for CentOS Linux; rather, it's a natural, inevitable next step intended to fulfill the project's goal of furthering enterprise Linux innovation.\" Since the announcement was made, many people expressed their anger on (IRC), Reddit and CentOS project's mailing list. CentOS 8's End of Life (EOL) has been moved up from May 2029 to December 31, 2021, while CentOS 7 is expected to receive maintenance updates through June 2024, outliving CentOS 8.\nSoon after Red Hat's announcement, Kurtzer announced his intentions to develop , to fill the role CentOS had been playing for so long. Kurtzer said Rocky Linux was named after Rocky McGaugh. \"Thinking back to early CentOS days... My cofounder was Rocky McGaugh. He is no longer with us, so as a H/T [] to him, who never got to see the success that CentOS came to be, I introduce to you...Rocky Linux\", Kurtzer wrote. \"Wikinews\" discussed with Kurtzer the beginning of CentOS, and future of Rocky Linux.\nWhile no formal date of release has been announced for Rocky Linux, Kurtzer said they are planning to release the CentOS replacement before the end of life of CentOS 8. Kurtzer also said Rocky Linux will run on both x86-64 and ARM-based processors, and CentOS users would be able to convert their OS to Rocky Linux just by running a single command.\nSaying Rocky Linux is for the community, Kurtzer said he \"take[s] the responsibility of ensuring that all decisions are in favor of the community and the project and free from corporate control\" including his own company. Talking about the attention from the userbase Rocky Linux has received, Kurtzer said, \"I have never seen an open community come together this fast and be this passionate about working together towards a common goal.\"\nInterview with Gregory Kurtzer.\n Why was CentOS originally created? What were the reasons why it was then absorbed by Red Hat?\n CentOS was originally created because Red Hat decided to EOL (End of Life) (RHL) shortly after releasing RHL 8. Overnight, RHL ceased to exist and Red Hat instead released Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) which was a commercial only product. This means that the majority of RHL users were left without a \"free\" solution or upgrade path.\nAt the time a Linux distribution that I founded called CAOS Linux was just beginning to get underway, and we too were relying on RHL as a bootstrap build environment. One of our developers, Rocky McGaugh, quickly rebuilt the sources in RHEL to give us a stable foundation. That was the beginning of CentOS which was released as an open source project.\nAfter CentOS became widely known, CentOS was separated from Caos Linux Foundation and another person took the lead. Later, the project underwent some drama \u2014 lost developers, contributors, and a lot of support, to the point where only a couple of developers were running everything and Red Hat hired most of them. I had no visibility of the acquisition of CentOS.\n How has CentOS evolved since it became a part of Red Hat?\n Red Hat has invested a good deal of resources into the CentOS project itself and the community has benefited from additional developers, closer ties to Red Hat's internal development team and infrastructure (including Fedora), marketing, branding, conference presence, etc.\nRed Hat has always been a tremendous supporter of Linux and open source, but that doesn't make Red Hat/IBM a good home for CentOS.\n How will this move by Red Hat, to move focus towards Stream, affect those who relied on CentOS?\n The focus towards Stream, while not exactly meeting the needs of enterprise use cases, wasn't the biggest problem, it was the unexpected change in the CentOS End Of Life (EOL) which moved from 2029 to 2021. But either one, much less both together, demonstrates that the Community Enterprise Operating System is not technically \"community\" or \"enterprise\". We have heard from many people now that this move has undermined not only trust in CentOS, but also other open source distributions of Linux which are commercially controlled. Who is to stop them from doing something very similar?\n Tell us about Rocky Linux.\n Rocky Linux is a Community Enterprise Linux distribution by the community and for the community. Our goal is to be with RHEL and provide a long life for enterprise needs.\n How will Rocky Linux aim to fill the void that CentOS will leave?\n The last time I checked, CentOS was the most utilized Linux server operating system on the Internet. All of these users, including development teams, need stability. Linux is free. Myself, among many thousands of developers and companies around the world, have contributed to what makes up a Linux distribution. While nobody has a problem with companies offering value by building a usable, supportable platform out of open source software, there needs to be a freely available version out of respect to all of the people who have made the distribution possible as well as the organizations that have contributed time and resources into Linux. It is not owned by the Linux distribution vendor, it is packaged by them.\nRocky [Linux] will provide a freely available, stable, enterprise-grade operating system that can be used everywhere by anyone.\n Will Rocky Linux provide a way to migrate CentOS 7 and 8 to Rocky Linux? How will you ensure it is a smooth transition?\n We are not currently forking CentOS 7 because that has not changed its EOL. If that changes, we will rebuild that as well.\nTo convert a CentOS 8 system to Rocky Linux 8, you only need to run a single command:\ndnf install http://your.favorite.rocky.mirror/path/to/rocky-release*.rpm\nBecause Rocky is completely compatible with both CentOS and RHEL, this single command is all you will have to do to keep your system running, patched, and supported.\n Which hardwares will Rocky Linux run on? Is the aim to provide support for all hardwares CentOS supported, or just those which Red Hat supported?\n So far we have very active support and interest in as well as . Nobody from has reached out to us (yet).\n Will Rocky Linux be the same as CentOS in functionality, or will it do some things differently?\n Bug-for-bug compatibility.\nWe've already been approached by multiple people asking about (SIGs) for value adds over and above the base enterprise platform. One of my interests, for example, can be supported here with an HPC () SIG. , /, and enhanced security have been among the other SIG proposals we've received.\n What are some of the challenges that Rocky Linux currently faces? How do you plan to tackle those?\n Velocity of growth is the biggest challenge so far. We are six days old and we keep hitting the invite link limits for our , which now has thousands of people in it. I've requested a sponsorship from Slack, but so far, we haven't had a very positive outcome. We're looking into alternatives to Slack for real-time communications as well. For durable discussion, we've had more than 100,000 views of our forums in three days, and already we're hitting limits with our hosting there, so that needs to be scaled soon as well.\nAlso, we are working on certifications and standards which have been a consistent request. That means that the security and compliance team is guiding how every aspect of the infrastructure is set up to guarantee security, compliance, and trust.\n How many developers are working on Rocky Linux? What are the important things that require significant developer time and attention?\n We are about 65 contributors actively driving Rocky right now, all in small task groups to do specific things. We also have about another 250 who have volunteered and are awaiting roles, and even more asking to help drive and build the community. We also have small to massive corporations stepping up to support us in the form of sponsorships, donations, mirrors, hardware, cloud resources, etc.\nVery careful attention will be paid to the security, trust, and compliance of what we are creating.\nI have never seen an open community come together this fast and be this passionate about working together towards a common goal.\n Can we expect Rocky Linux to be released before CentOS 8 reaches end of life?\n Yes. While we haven't given any ETA on release, we already have a large percentage of the work underway and if I were to make a SWAG [], it will be near the end of Q1 or beginning of Q2 2021.\n How will the governing body of Rocky Linux function? How can Rocky Linux ensure similar situation like this does not repeat?\n At the moment, we have a structure similar to most organizations. People have been empowered to make decisions and report upwards. This may change in the future, but right now, we need leadership and I take the responsibility of ensuring that all decisions are in favor of the community and the project and free from corporate control (even from my own company).\nMy commitment to the project is that Rocky will always remain in the best interest of the community and everyone who wishes to be part of the organization, with good intentions, will be welcomed. Since day one, Rocky's coordination efforts have been completely transparent. I invite anyone reading this to join the #rocky-coordination channel on our Slack instance. There you'll find many high-level discussions taking place with direct community involvement.\n What are the short-term and long-term goals of Rocky Linux and how will the project ensure it stays on its path?\n Short term: organization of technology and people.\nMid term: general availability of Rocky Linux.\nLong term: growing the community like sponsoring SIGs."}

Wales is the first of the UK to introduce this ban.\nThis is in addition to various restrictions on the practice, including a ban on smoking in enclosed public spaces in place since 2007 and a ban on smoking in cars with children in place since 2015.\nThe , governed by left-wing party , said the measure was to discourage adults and children alike from smoking by making it appear less normal, and encourage the already partaking to quit. \nTwo hospitals in the country's south have installed a button-activated speaker system to remind people hospitals are smoke-free. In 2016, a similar mechanism was tried at hospitals across Wales, where an announcement recorded by local school children would play upon pressing a button.\nMinister for Mental Health, Wellbeing, and the Welsh Language said she was \"immensely proud to have brought into force this law\", and \"[t]his legislation will benefit the health of future generations in Wales, as fewer children will be exposed to smoking\". She concluded, \"[w]e need to do everything we can to combat the harmful effects of smoking.\"\nThe government was criticised by many smokers rights groups. Simon Clark, Director of the compared the law to \"taking a sledgehammer to crack a nut\", saying: \"There is no evidence that smoking in the open air poses a risk to anyone else's health, including children.\" The director further explained, \"Banning smoking on hospital grounds is particularly unjust because it targets smokers who may be stressed and in need of a comforting cigarette. Most smokers use their common sense and don't smoke around small children. They don't need politicians telling them how to behave.\"\n\"Wikinews\" contacted Eluned Morgan's office to know more about this ban.\nQuestions asked to Eluned Morgan's office.\n What is the core objective of this law? If everything works out as you had intended, regarding this law, how would the future of Wales (in terms of smoking) look like?\n We are bringing in this legislation to protect people from being exposed to harmful second-hand smoke, help those trying to quit and reduce the chances of children starting smoking.\nWe are committed to our longer-term goal of making more of Wales' public spaces smoke-free and helping people to make positive changes to their health and wellbeing. We intend to progress work to extend the smoking ban to outdoor areas of cafes and restaurants and city and town centres.\n How do you respond to the criticism the government is trying to \"micro-manage people's lives\"?\n The law is being introduced to protect the public's health, both from harmful second-hand smoke and to support those trying to quit. We hope to denormalise smoking among children and young people so they are less likely to start in the first place.\n Do you think it is an individual informed adult's right to smoke? Why, or why not?\n Smoking is the biggest cause of early preventable death in Wales. We have brought in this legislation as we need to do everything we can to combat the harmful effects of smoking and to support people to make positive choices for their health. We hope that by increasing the number of smoke-free areas it will improve the health of people in Wales, but there will still be places where adults can smoke.\n Where should someone smoke, if they so choose?\n The smoke-free law only applies in areas set out in the legislation.\n Does the current ban on smoking in playgrounds only apply when there are kids present, or should it be during all times? Can you please elaborate?\n All public playgrounds in Wales will be required to be smoke-free all of the time. Even if there are no children in the public playground, the playground must be smoke-free at all times. We know that reducing the number of young people taking up smoking saves lives. Therefore, restricting smoking in areas where children and young people go regularly, like public playgrounds and school grounds, will help to make smoking behaviour appear less normal and reduce the chances of children and young people taking up smoking."}

Of them, Adrian Mizher agreed to answer some questions by phone on March 30 about their campaigns and policies. The following is the interview with Mr Mizher.\nMizher describes himself as a senior loan closer on his profile at , a -based subsidiary of . He has lived in for five years and the for 16 of the last 24 years. A graduate of , he grew up in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and has lived for eight years in Albuquerque, New Mexico. He endeavours to bring \"a never ending fight for fidelity to the Constitution and promotion of our Conservative values\", speaking to \"Wikinews\" on matters ranging from the economy to immigration.\nAn Inside Elections poll published on March 18 shows Republican candidate Susan Wright, the widow of Ron Wright, is ahead by 21% followed by Democrat with 17% and Republican with 8% with a 4.6% among 450 likely voters. The district is considered \"lean Republican\" by Inside Elections and voted 51% in favour of Donald Trump in last year's US presidential election. This is down from 54% for Trump in 2016's presidential election, the same poll stated.\nInterview with Adrian Mizher (Independent candidate).\n Well, my name is Adrian Mizher. I don't have much history in official politics \u2014 I've never run for office before \u2014 but I have been paying attention to politics my whole life, I have been playing close attention to it, so I feel myself just as knowledgeable as anyone else is on the issues of the day, and the history of the news and politics during my lifetime, like I said I have been paying close attention to. So, that's pretty much it in terms of the history of politics. This is my first foray into a[n] official race for either national or local politics.\nI graduated college in 2001 with a bachelor's degree in accounting from in . I have a wife, three children. I was a history and math teacher for five years after college and then got into banking; have been in banking for the last 16 years. That's it, that's my r\u00e9sum\u00e9!\n What are, in your opinion, the powers and duties of the ?\n Well, as it lists in the Constitution: to carry out the duties that the Constitution lists for Congress to do in , Section 8 and to uphold that Constitution against any invasion both foreign and domestic as the says. Primarily, what a representative is supposed to do is carry the power of the purse and make sure that the is such that fits with its Constitutional limitations, which of course they are certainly not doing and haven't done for quite a long time. \n You're running as an independent in a House district controlled by the Republicans since 1983, and currently contested by both major parties as well as the Libertarian Party. Why do you think Texas will elect an independent this time?\n Well, I think if people get to know my viewpoints, they will see that they are very grounded in the Constitution and in our Founding Principles, and they are very conservative at heart: things that the Republican Party should be, but often is not. We, not necessarily just from this district, but we have elected many Republicans to Congress who, when they get there, don't \"act\" so Republican. So, in this case, because it was a unique situation, I chose to take a label that would be more clear about the message I want to bring: even clearer than the label of 'Republican'. So, I put down on my application 'Constitution Party', so I would run under the banner of the Constitution Party. The 's office then informed me, after they have said \"yes, I can put that\" that the Constitution Party, while it is a political party, is not officially registered with the Secretary of State, so they couldn't list me under that name on the ballot, and so my choice at that point was to be listed as an independent, which I took. So, it's not so much a calculation of \"I think Texas will elect an independent\" in a Republican-controlled district as it was the ability to, like I said, make a clearer messaging on my label rather than just the label \"Republican\", without it being political suicide like it would be in a normal election \"and\" without it away from another Republican any more than it will be completely splintered with all 23 candidates.\n What do you think about the governance of the late Ron Wright [...] the election itself was of course called because of his death?\n Yes, his untimely passing is very sad. I thought Ron was an excellent Congressman. I met Ron several times, had some private conversations with him, and I have to give him great credit for doing everything, as far as I know, that he said in his he was going to do. And everything he told me, like I said, in private, that he would be interested in getting done. He went out and voted the right way, and did the best he could to get that done. So, I have nothing but good things to say about Congressman Wright \u2014 I thought he did a great job for our district and I'm sorry to see that he's gone.\n What are some of the most pressing issues you will raise to Congress if elected?\n The one I already mentioned, almost to the exclusion of all else, which is to shrink the size of the federal government and the federal budget. The federal government is far too large, it is far too involved in our everyday lives. It's far too outside the bounds of its constitutional limitations. And I fear we are headed towards even worse things to come, and we need to turn that around and bring it back down to the size that it was always intended, and make our local and state governments more important in our lives and the federal government less important. That's by far the number one issue in for Congressman Mizher. And that's by far the number one issue that I want to speak about on the campaign trail. \nOther issues that are also of importance: election integrity. Unfortunately, it's always been of course important, but it is all that much more important nowadays after the that we just went through. Whether or not that election was \"stolen\", as people say, I really don't know. I certainly don't have evidence to show that it was, nor have I seen foolproof evidence to show that it wasn't, but the problem is that so many people believe it was. Whether it was or was not, the fact that many people think it was \u2014 that's an issue, and we have to do something to make sure that people have confidence in the elections. If we don't have that, we don't have anything and, unfortunately, more will ensue because of that feeling if we don't get a handle on it. So, that is another hugely important issue that Congressman Mizher wants to speak about and work on. \nImmigration is another big issue. is a problem, and we need to make it easier and simpler and less costly to \"legally\" immigrate; we should be welcoming all the immigrants that we can that want to come here, and we should be glad to have them. And, often the Republican Party does not speak in those words, and they ought to, because we're so anxious to , as well we should. But, the best way to stop the flow of illegal immigration is to make our \"legal\" immigration system much simpler and more easy to access, as well as, like I said, less costly and less time-consuming. And, I think most people would choose to \"legally\" immigrate if we could make the system better than it currently is. \n Your website says both \"we must remain a sovereign nation who is in control of all our borders\" and \"our immigration process should be simple enough that a child can follow it.\" Could you please elaborate?\n Yeah! I think it also says on the website, if I can quote myself, that if somebody wants to come here\u2014I certainly believe in the that's on the : that we do want the world's , and those that were not wanted somewhere else, and they may not have amounted to something somewhere else in the world, but they . And they can with the freedom and opportunity that our country provides; we want them and we want them to achieve their best and make us better by them coming here, as have waves of immigrants in the past, of which \"all of us\", (), have descended from. And, we need to continue that pattern where we are welcoming immigrants to come here. \nTo elaborate on how to make the process simpler: if they don't have a communicable disease, if they do not have a history of criminal activity, if they're willing to learn English \u2014 of course they may or may not know English when they show up at our doorstep \u2014 and if they're willing to learn American history \u2014 they may or may not know that when they show up at our doorstep \u2014 and, down the road are willing to to our flag and our values and say \"yeah, I'd like to be an American\", then we want them! If they're not bringing us harm, either through physical disease or criminal behaviour, we want them. And then, all we ask is that those simple things \u2014 learn our language, while bringing your own culture and its influences to us to improve what we have here in our \u2014 and we want you. And then, you can be allowed in on a temporary basis to do whatever it is you've stated you've come here to do, and then work your way towards citizenship \u2014 and again, I wouldn't make it be that long; I know now people have thrown around 'seven years', '14 years', to me that seems too long!\nIf somebody wants to be here and wants to be an immigrant, we want them to be here. Again, within certain limitations: we can't take everybody, but we certainly should have an annual cap of some kind \u2014 I don't have a particular number in mind on what that would be \u2014 but I want people to be here who want to be here.\n Your website states \"as the , did we must appeal to the Supreme Judge for our \"; \"we must regain the firm reliance on the protection of Divine Providence as our Declaration urges us to seek.\" Could you please elaborate on that?\n Well, I think it sort of speaks for itself. America and its founding is inextricably tied to and a belief in God and a , if they don't use the word 'God' in the , but in the divine \u2014 if you read the writings that they wrote to each other at the time, clearly all of these men had some belief to some extent or another in the supernatural, in the divine, in something , in something \u2014 a guiding hand \u2014 that we have over us that provides us values and a moral code to which we should aspire. \nAnd, I think that America has been throwing that away for at least half a century now, and running as quickly as we can in the opposite direction throughout my lifetime. Most of the time, I see God and Godly values, especially those of Christianity, if not other religions, trashed and ridiculed and made fun of in popular culture, and I think that has a corrosive effect on our society that I think is very detrimental. And, I think it is one of, if not the main cause of many of the social ills we see today; is the fact that many people do not have this belief that there is something greater than themselves: something to which they must aspire to. And therefore we're all a little kingdom unto ourselves what we believe to be right and wrong, and where we differ it's just going to be the guy with the biggest stick who gets to beat his way onto the other guy. And, I think that's a very dangerous place to be, and I hope we turn around from that direction and go back to where our roots were in our founding.\n How will you handle the if elected?\n How would \"I handle the vaccine rollout if elected\"? Well, I'm not sure that that's Congress' responsibility to \"decide\" how to handle the vaccine rollout. Get as many vaccines out as quickly as we can, and let the states governments and local governments decide how best to distribute them to their population, and pretty much just be out of the way and do what they need to have done. \n How will you help the economically-disadvantaged if elected?\n I think the best way to help the economically disadvantaged is to put that help as close to them as possible, and to get it out of Washington, D.C. I think every time Washington D.C. tries to help people, they almost always create more trouble than they solve. So, those who are economically disadvantaged are going to best be helped by their friends and family and communities and local organisations and charities that are near them and on the ground. The argument will come back the other way: \"well, what about those who fall through the cracks?\" Well, that is what local and state government is for. I don't believe Americans are so callous that they'll let people be starving or destitute on the street who don't want to be. They will find a way to help their fellow man.\nRight now, a lot of people just pass by those on the street we see that are destitute because \"you know what? I've paid taxes, and the federal government is taking care of that, therefore I've already done my duty\". But I would like to devolve that back to the localities and to personal responsibility to say, \"You know what? The homeless in your area, those who are sick in your area and don't have healthcare, those who are poor and need food in your area: they're your responsibility. And I want you people, the locals to pick those up for, again, friends, family, churches, local communities, charities\" and, if all else fails and a government needs to step in so we don't have those sick and starving, then that should be as local a government as possible because it will provide the best help for that person rather than the big meat from Washington, D.C. that just has to throw out money in a one-size-fits all sort of solution. \"Plus\", it will be allowed to require back from the person receiving help certain responses that you would want from this person so that hopefully, they are not continually needing of this help but only on a temporary basis. \nAnd, I'm happy to help you out, and here is how we can get on a path where you won't need my help anymore. That's much more likely to come from local help than it is from a cold and distant help from Washington, D.C.\n What are your thoughts on President [Joe] Biden?\n [laughs] I think you could probably guess based by what I'm saying! He's far too much into the left-wing agenda. You know, I think, like a lot of politicians Joe Biden is doing what he needs to do in order to satisfy the constituency he continues to satisfy to stay in power. I'm not even sure all the things he's proposing are things Joe Biden really believes are going to work. I mean, I think that's true of a lot of politicians: I think they propose and promote theories and ideas that they themselves don't even truly believe in oftentimes, but they know that they need to do these things for political expediency. And, I think his agenda is far too left-wing and unconstitutional, and I don't support it from \u2014 almost all of it. \n All right, moving onto the complete \"other side\" of it, what are your thoughts on the former President [Donald] Trump?\n Ah, President Trump! I think President Trump did a lot of great things for the United States of America. I give him a lot of credit for much of , although not all of it. Especially in the Middle East, where he was successful in bringing about peace agreements; I am a strong supporter of his , I thought that was a great and courageous move. For the most part, I think he did a pretty good job of appointing to the , although I'm slightly disappointed in all three of his to the Supreme Court, but certainly better than some that we've had in the past. \nI think President Trump gets a lot of credit for de-regulation and cutting of government , which helped the economy quite a bit, and certainly is in line with my philosophy of governance and how things should go. I'm a bit frustrated with President Trump on \"two\" subjects: one, his caustic and divisive nature did not win as many converts as could have, if he had learned how to speak a little better and more politely. I do like, in fact, the thing I probably like most about him is we finally had a Republican \u2014 a big national Republican who was willing to fight the left \u2014 most Republicans that I see are spineless cowards and not willing to fight the left and they run cowering into the corner afraid to be called a racist and a bigot and a and a and a and all the other names that leftists like to put on us. Trump did not run from that and I appreciate that \u2014 that he was willing to fight the left, and he stood strong against all of their attacks, especially from the leftist media \u2014 I know I'm talking to the media now so pardon me for disparaging you \u2014 so I really appreciate that about Donald Trump that he was a fighter and that he was willing to fight for the values that I believe in.\n\"But\", I think he often did it in a[n] overly brash, overly caustic, overly harsh way that wasn't necessary. And was not able to explain why. The conservative values that he says he held \u2014 in which he governed from for the most part \u2014 why those were a better way, and he needs to \u2014 any national leader needs to be able to do that. It's fine to speak to the choir \u2014 I could go to a room of Republicans and they'd all applaud [for] everything I've told you so far. \"But\" that doesn't do us very much good unless we can convince independents and Democrats to say \"hey, you know what? This smaller government thing, this constitutionally-limited government thing, this really is a good idea! This is actually the best way to help the poor, this is actually the best way to get people healthcare, this is actually the best way to take care of the environment and all the other issues\" that we are often told we don't care about.\nAnd last point on President Trump: frustrated quite a bit with his attitude. He made it difficult to defend him, oftentimes, and that's a frustrating thing because you want to defend the agenda, but then when he does or says some things that are indefensible, it becomes difficult because those two things are so tied together. And lastly, my biggest criticism of Donald Trump is he did not cut the size of the federal government. Donald Trump talked a lot about 'better' government: \"I'm going to do this better than Obama\", \"I'm going to do that better than Obama\", \"I'm going to be more efficient\", \"I'm going to cut red tape\": that's great. But I want smaller government, Mr President. I want you to cut spending, but he didn't do \u2014 he spent \"more money\" than Obama did! And, I have a \"real\" problem with that. That is not conservative. And, that's often true of a lot of Republicans. They talk a \"lot\" like I do, about but when they get their hands in the pie, they like to spend as much as anybody else. And I have a real problem with that. I think that was the biggest failing of President Trump.\n Do you have any remaining thoughts on the ongoing crisis?\n Well yes, I have a lot of thoughts, I mean, as you can tell, I have a lot of thoughts and opinions about everything! The current border crisis I find interesting \u2014 again, both sides like to use this to the other side with. When President Trump was in office, were awful. Now that President Biden's in office, these aren't kids in cages, they're merely until we can find some better place for them to be. But Republicans will say \"hey, when Trump was in office [...] those aren't kids in cages, we have to stop the bleeding\" but now all of a sudden Biden's in office \"look at him he's so cruel\" and I'm very frustrated with the illegal immigration debate because frankly, it's not that difficult to solve.\nIt's gonna be a lot like how we decide to let people in or out of our house as a guest. We check them out: if we think they're safe, we're going to let them in and welcome them in. If not, then we won't and we need more , we need more case workers, we need more personnel there to deal with these millions coming over. And then we can enforce the few laws we should have, the very simple process that we should have, we should be able to enforce it very strictly. And, we're not. But it's not just Joe Biden's fault, which is what a lot of Republicans would tell you. Suddenly now this is this huge crisis and before it was not. That's not true. Now, it's more of a crisis now because Biden said \"yeah, welcome in, we have open borders\" so of course more are coming, but is the practice really all that different than what President Trump was doing? And, frankly I don't see the evidence that it is.\nAnd, that's bothersome to me: that both sides use the issue, but both sides don't seem to really to want to \"solve\" the issue unless the other side and solves it their way. Now, that's very bothersome to me.\n Regarding the economy, your website states your goal in office will be to \"begin to move us towards a more balanced approach\" because \"our society's foundation and framework are far outside of the needed balance.\" Could you please elaborate?\n Well, I'm a big fan of over , which is under heavy attack nowadays: that \"capitalism is bad\". But I think that there, again, this goes to Republicans not being able to explain our messaging very well. There are problems with capitalism too, and a much better term for the system that we should have, but don't have, is the . Because capitalism, the left is, in many ways correct. It rewards greed, and it rewards \"\" in some ways. I'm not a big fan of big business either, I do agree they try to keep all the money for themselves and mistreat their workers \u2014 I am one of those workers and I've worked for a living my whole life, and they're right. The employer is absolutely trying to pay you as little as possible and get as much work out of you as possible. Of course!\nAnd the worker is of course trying to get as much money as possible for as little effort as possible. Naturally. Now there's nothing wrong with either of those doing that, we just got to understand that's what human nature is. And so capitalism does reward those with the capital, and therefore the rich are advantaged. And I have a problem with that. The government should not give an advantage to the rich. The government should have a free enterprise \u2014 I think that's a much better word for it \u2014 point of view where it gives no preference to either. Here's an example: if somebody comes to my little town in Kennedale, and it's Amazon[.com], and Amazon says \"you know what? We want to set up a huge plant and we're going to employ 25 thousand people.\" Well I can promise you that plant will be under construction very, very quickly. They will get , the red carpet will be rolled out for them, all the regulations will be waived as much as possible and Amazon will be in business as quickly as possible. But if you or \"I\" wanted to start a little coffee shop, it's not that they would tell us \"no\", but we would certainly have to pay for \"all\" of the necessary fees. We would have to go through \"all\" of the hoops that are naturally there, and we would be disadvantaged as opposed to Amazon. I have a problem with that, when the rich guy gets the red carpet rolled out for him and the small guy doesn't, and that's what capitalism does. And, I think our government needs to take a much more even-handed balanced approach to not providing those preferences, and I think we would have more small- and medium-sized businesses which then would increase , and I'm just not a fan of and there's a \"lot\" of businesses in this country that are too big to fail and are able to easily crowd out the smaller guys. And I don't like that. \n What are your thoughts on the size of the US military?\n It's too big. As far as I know, I would need some justification for why we have to be that big. Now this is not going to be popular for me amongst Republicans, I'm going to get attacked by the right on that. But unless I can have some justification for why we are spending more than \u2014 again here's a leftist talking point \u2014 more than the other nine countries behind us combined \u2014 yeah! I'd like to know why we're doing that too If we conservatives \u2014 if we constitutionalists think that is a waste of money and 's a waste of money and 's a waste of money and the 's unconstitutional and a waste of money and the 's unconstitutional and a waste of money but doesn't? I don't understand that logic.\nThe Pentagon wastes a lot of money, just as much as anybody else. Because the federal government can't do anything well without wasting money \u2014 any \"large\" enterprise like that naturally; gather that many human beings together trying to do something and there's going to be a waste of energy and money. The Pentagon needs to have its belt tightened quite a bit, and it needs to justify more for why it has the money it has, rather than just having it. Now as a Congressman, I wouldn't be in charge like the President is, but I would think the President would want an answer to say \"hey, why are we doing this? Why do we have soldiers over there?\" 'Cause I can't stand news reports where I hear \"three Americans died in a helicopter crash today in Namibia\" and why are we even \"having\" soldiers in Namibia? And that's a real problem to me, and what a Congressman is able to do about that is to hold the purse-strings until he gets justification from The Pentagon as to why it needs as much money as they want.\nSo, your question was the size of the military, right? Wasn't that your original question. And the bottom line is it's too big. It's too big. It does \"not\" need to be that big. It needs to be smaller than it is, unless we have some justification that can be given to say \"hey, we need this and we need to do that with it\", okay.\n What are your thoughts on the criminal justice system?\n Um, I think it is a big problem, but \"not\" for the reasons that, again, you're gonna \u2014 I guess this makes me sound more independent every time I say \"both sides\", but it is not for the reasons that leftists are trying to teach us, which is that America's a horrible -marked place that can never recover from its racist past. I don't believe that to be true. Certainly there are elements of racism still around, and in government, and people are not being treated right from time-to-time over the issue of race. And where that is occurring, it must be shouted loudly and mercilessly stomped out. I will be the first in line to end any form of racism from anybody anywhere, but I think that that is overused in today's society; the left finds it everywhere! Racism, racism, racism to the point where it means nothing anymore.\nAnd, unfortunately, I think it does crowd out the fact that there are two systems of justice. There's a system of justice for the haves: if you can hire the better lawyer who can play the game better, you're probably going to have a better chance, and the have-nots, who are not going to get as good a shake in the justice system. It is unfortunately not as blinded as our tell us that it is. Now, this won't make me popular on the left but I look at somebody like Hillary Clinton or , I feel like they're getting away with stuff. Again, do I have proof of that? Of course not, I'm reading biased news like everybody else. My judgement is they're getting away with stuff. But I am for sure that prominent Republicans get away with stuff too. Prominent non-political figures get away with stuff. There are definitely, as John Edwards famously said \u2014 somebody whose policies I can't stand but he was correct in this, although not for the reasons he said, \u2014 \"there are \"; there are two systems of justice, that's true.\nAmerica does have a problem with , much more so than it has a problem with racism. But because we are so hyper-focused \u2014 oftentimes where it doesn't exist \u2014 on racism, the classism gets covered up. So our justice system needs to be more responsive and \u2014 like I said with everything else \u2014 more localised. I would love to see a justice system \u2014 the example I always use, it's going to get scoffed at by many people, is , . And that's a fake TV show and of course reality can't mirror that, but if we could try, that would be the right way to go where justice, is that we call it a 'justice system' but it so often doesn't dispense justice and it operates much more like a legal system rather than a justice system and it dispenses \"legal\" opinions. \nAnd again, if you're better at playing the game, you're more likely to have a good outcome and it should not be that way. It needs to be more localised, under more local control where you know your police officer's name who's getting you in trouble, where you \"know\" the judge's name who you're going before and he knows your name and he says \"Hey Adrian, what're you in here for? Oh, okay.\" and he can dispense then actual justice, which is going to be a blend of and mercy and tailored to what I need, or what that criminal needs. So again, that devolving of the power back towards the people, I think that's the better way to do better justice system than we have now.\n What are your thoughts on Medicare?\n I think it's completely unconstitutional and eventually \u2014 I need to \"stress\" that word: eventually \u2014 it needs to be done away with. It is \"not\" the federal government's responsibility to be providing healthcare or \"access\" to healthcare \u2014 not actually providing healthcare, providing access to healthcare or healthcare insurance to the poor and those who don't have it. It is a \"bad\" idea to think that the federal government is going to distribute that and do it well. There are much better ways to provide healthcare. If a government needs to be providing healthcare to somebody it should be the state government, or even better their local city government who can dispense a form of what we now call Medicare. But, it's definitely unconstitutional. There's no way to justify that. \nJust because it's unconstitutional doesn't make it a bad idea \u2014 there are some things that are unconstitutional that \"yes, yeah you're right Adrian it's not in the Constitution but it's still a good idea\". This is both unconstitutional \"and\" a bad idea. It is not a good idea for us to pay money to Washington, D.C. so they can turn around and pay it back to us in the form of helping the poor have access to healthcare that they otherwise wouldn't. So, eventually it needs to be done away with. We can't go in there guns blazing like a bull in a china closet and just start yanking the rug out from everybody and cutting these programmes off, because you're going to cause more human suffering than you're going to solve. But it needs to be rolled back, and people need to understand that we are headed the other direction, guys. You're gonna have to solve your own problems more locally, and think of solutions for yourselves more locally rather than relying on us to do it up in Washington [D.C].\n What are your thoughts on the rise in as a result of the and recent in Atlanta?\n I'm not sure there is a rise in anti-Asian sentiment, I know the media tells us there is. Again, like I said before about racism \u2014 I don't want to say there's \"not\"not, I certainly can't prove there isn't a rise in anti-Asian sentiment, I'm just not sure that there is. And, from what I understand \u2014 I'm no expert on what happened in Atlanta a couple weeks ago, \u2014 but my understanding is that it didn't have anything to do with race. It happened to be that most of the victims were Asian, but that that was not the intended target, necessarily, of the perpetrator, the criminal. So, again, I am leaving room for myself to be wrong there, or in many other famous incidents that get reported on the news about racism. From what I can tell, it does not appear to be a racially-motivated issue.\nSo, I will take issue with the question at first. I am not sure \u2014 although I am not-not sure \u2014 that there is a rise in anti-Asian sentiment. This pandemic has been around with us for a year, so you would think we would be hearing more about this anti-Asian sentiment since then, so it seems a little opportunistic now as an issue for certain politicians \u2014 mostly on the left \u2014 to use to their advantage. But, if there is anti-Asian sentiment, like any other racist nonsense, it must be stamped out mercilessly. First we must show that it's true, and then once demonstrated, it has to be ostracised completely from our society. To judge somebody on the basis of their skin colour or ethnicity to me is the most intellectually-vapid, stupid, moronic, nonsensical thing I've ever heard of. And where that exists, we have to destroy it.\n What are your thoughts on President Biden's recent talks with China [on March 19, 2021]?\n Well, again, I need to know more to really determine. Reading the media that I enjoy reading because they agree with my point of view, well, he got taken to school and they took him out of the woodshed and embarrassed us, you know. I don't know, I don't know that that's true, so I \"need\" to know more to really have an opinion on his recent talks with China. I'm nervous \u2014 I don't trust that Joe Biden is ready to stand up to China in a way that needs to be done, but these most recent talks, again I don't have enough evidence to have an opinion on it and say \"yeah, he really screwed up\" in this way or that way. It's more of a feeling of general distrust that he is not going to stand up to China in the way that the United States needs to, because China definitely is our most pressing foreign threat at the moment.\n The of February left millions without power, including of course the 6th district, sometimes for days. Its damages are estimated at USD 195 billion and 111 [people] are estimated to have been killed. How will you endeavour to prevent this from happening again if elected?\n Well, my house was one of those that was without power and mine is one of the ones with a few thousand dollars worth of damage, so I certainly feel the issue personally. Although, I was out of town \u2014 \u2014 I was out of town when this happened on a \"long-ago\" scheduled trip, so my adult children were here in the house and had to deal with that. But, my house was definitely affected.\nIt is not primarily the federal government's responsibility to solve that problem or to prevent it from happening again. So, I'm not trying to duck your question, but along with my philosophy of smaller federal government \u2014 this is one of the areas where I don't want us looking to our federal officials and say \"what would you do to solve it.\" Now, what a federal official could do is certainly put pressure on the state officials to solve it and, again, from what I've read \u2014 no fully informed expert here \u2014 but from what I've read in the media about what happened, we've got quite a few problems: that our power plants are not winterised \u2014 naturally, we're in Texas, this doesn't happen very often, \u2014 is it really worth wasting the money winterising them or should we just suffer like we did every hundred years when this freak storm comes through. But what was more bothersome to me is hearing that all of the members, or most, of the members from [Electric Reliability Council of Texas] were not even citizens of this state! \nSo, I have criticisms of the way the state government seems to have things set up. But I would say primarily it's a state government issue to find out the reasons for and resolve rather than a federal issue. Because frankly, energy production and distribution, again, is not in the Constitution and there should not be a Department of Energy or a federal role in taking on such things.\n What else would set you apart from the Republican Party and other candidates who would also claim to promote \"conservative values\"?\n I'm sure we're all going to get asked that: \"eleven of you Republicans, Adrian \u2014 who's an independent but, you know promotes himself as a conservative and constitutionalist \u2014 so how are you guys all different, you all sound the same and say the same things.\" I agree, and I'm glad for that. I don't to distinguish \u2014 I don't want to look for ways to say \"hey, let me say it a little bit differently this way so I distinguish myself from them\"; I hope that all twelve of us \u2014 as well as the Libertarian, as well as Phil \u2014 and, for that matter any of the Democrats, all want to promote constitutionalism and constitutional ways of governance at the federal level. So, I'm happy that we all sound the same, if indeed we do. \nSo, where I may or may not have separated myself in these answers already, I'll leave that to you, but one thing I do believe separates me \u2014 and I know all these people personally \u2014 but I definitely think I am going to be the loudest and most aggressive voice for our conservative values of anybody in the field, and we need that. We need somebody not just with the right ideas in their head, but somebody who has the spine and the aggressiveness to tirelessly and go after it, the way the left does for their values. We must have that same intensity, we must have that same drive that they do, and I believe I'm able to explain these values to others in a way \u2014 like I criticised President Trump for that he could not \u2014 I am able to explain this in a way that I believe won't convince everybody, certainly, you never will do that, but will be able to convince many people that the conservative values doesn't equal racism, the conservative values doesn't equal hates the poor, hates minorities, hates women, things the left portrays us as. We have to fight against that and I think I, and my personality, would both couple the aggressiveness, but also the ability to explain these values to people who may not currently understand them and have a misconception of what conservatism is.\n How has COVID-19 affected your campaign?\n COVID-19 has not affected my campaign that I can tell. Now, I have never campaigned without COVID-19 around so I guess I don't have a reference point, but I can't tell an effect that COVID-19 has had on my campaign. \n If you aren't elected this time, what are your ambitions for the future?\n I think that remains to be seen. I don't know.\n Lighthearted comment before we finish this: which historical figure do you identify with the most, and why? It is an open-ended question.\n I would say my favourite historical \u2014 I would say , who is certainly historical, but to me is well beyond historical as my favourite, but that also takes us out of \"light-hearted\" and into a much more serious spiritual place. So I'll say is my favourite historical figure, somebody who I have \"tremendous\" admiration for. Working under the difficult circumstances that he did and the growth that he showed in his political life from where he was in the 1850s to right up to ; how he showed growth in his opinions and came to understand \u2014 again I believe in divine guidance \u2014 things that he previously had not understood. So, I think Abraham Lincoln would be my favourite although I don't know that I'm a whole lot like Lincoln other than sharing the same values.\nSo, I certainly have great admiration for Ronald Reagan as well: that's definitely someone I want to be like. Speaking of lighthearted, but his lighthearted humour and his ability to connect with people on that level is something I feel I am like and certainly aspire to be. So I picked two obvious ones. Yeah, kind of bland, right? Ask a Republican: \"who do you want to be like?\" \"Oh, Lincoln and Reagan...\", so yeah. Sorry that it's so generic.\n Any final comments?\n Nope! I'm pretty sure I laid it out, said it all. If I have a closing statement it's going to be to repeat what I said in the opening."}

Of them, the office of Democrat Daryl Eddings, Sr. agreed to answer some questions by phone March 30 about their campaigns and policies. The following is the interview with Ms Chatham on behalf of Mr Eddings, Sr.\nEddings is a federal law enforcement officer and senior non-commissioned officer in the US . His experience as operations officer of an aviation unit in the includes working in Los Angeles to control riots sparked by the and the police handling of , working with drug interdiction teams in Panama and Central America and fighting in the Middle East. He is the founder of Operation Battle Buddy, which has under his leadership kept in touch with over 20 thousand veterans and their families. He was born in California, but moved to . He endeavours to bring \"good government, not no government\". Campaign manager Faith Chatham spoke to \"Wikinews\" on matters ranging from healthcare to housing.\nAn Inside Elections poll published on March 18 shows Republican candidate Susan Wright, the widow of Ron Wright, is ahead by 21% followed by Democrat with 17% and Republican with 8% with a 4.6% among 450 likely voters. The district is considered \"lean Republican\" by Inside Elections and voted 51% in favour of Donald Trump in last year's US presidential election. This is down from 54% for Trump in 2016's presidential election, the same poll stated.\nInterview with Faith Chatham on behalf of Daryl Eddings, Sr. (Democrat).\n Could you please introduce Mr Eddings and his history more broadly?\n Okay. Daryl J. Eddings Sr is a retired senior non-commissioned officer. He has 26 years of military experience, and then part of that time he was also working for the . So, he had 30 years of federal law enforcement experience, and he's only 60 so that's pretty incredible. He's a highly decorated veteran; , but if you look at his uniform, there's not even a place to put another medal! Just about anything you could give him from a , he has earned. He lives in , Texas. His family ties, his dad's family, goes back six generations, but he says by an accident of birth he was born in California. So, he graduated from high school in California and went immediately into the military. And then, when he came out of the military, he became a single father and so he went back to California where his children were. And went into the National Guard in California and, at the same time he went to work for the US federal service. So, with the US federal service he was the non-commissioned officer, operations officer, on the back \u2014 he wasn't the commander of the plane, but he was the person that was in-command of everybody on the plane with US national service.\nSo he had fourteen deputies under him, and then he was supervising people on three different federal agencies. He basically, I found he'll say \"oh, I was in the military\" and then when I peel it down and I peel it down it's so much more complex. There is a time he basically went back to California thinking he'd be closer to his kids, but that was during the George Bush years. And if you remember what happened to people who go into the National Guard during that period of time, he was deported more during that period of time than otherwise. He was sent to Panama on drug interdiction, he patrolled the on drug interdiction and he was the operations commander for emergency management with the state of California while he was there.\nHe was the senior non-commissioned officer reporting to a during the , the riot, earthquakes, forest fires. He supervised an aviation unit that flew to this big state, you know, surveying it for wars, he was responsible for moving troops and equipment and people and personnel. And also his team was directly responsible for the security of the governor and the mayor and their staff during the O. J. Simpson and the Rodney King riots. So, he has an incredibly wide range of experience.\nIn his foreign deployments, and he's been deployed all over the world, he was the in Iraq, and there was a tactical team that was under his command that was looking for the top generals of the Revolutionary Guard, you know, right after Saddam [Hussein] and you know, that kind of stuff. He was being a provost marshal, it was the equivalent of being the police chief over a city of 50 thousand and a 75 mile (121 kilometre) radius. So, he's always been the person that was responsible for the people above him and below him. He's always been the person that they went to to find solutions. Whatever was needed, he was the one that was supposed to figure out how to get it and how to take care of it, and this is what he continues to do. \n What would he consider the powers of the US representative?\n The power of the US representative, in his thing, is the ability to deliver for the people what they need. He thinks that what most people are doing is not really, you know, that's not really; it upsets him to see so many of our representatives representing a very small number of people instead of really looking out for the majority of the people. He takes very seriously; he decided to \"run\", he'd been thinking about it for a long time but he made up his mind , because he doesn't believe that there are, he believes that there are too many in Congress that don't understand what their oath of office is. They don't understand that their loyalty is to the Constitution of the United States, not to any one person or a party.\nHe knows that there were too many of them up there that are applauding what [Donald] Trump did, and are saying that it was just a demonstration, or it was just a riot. And he's been in riots; he knows what a riot is and he knows this was an . He believes very truthfully that one of the greatest powers that we have is the power to vote, and this was an attempt to abridge the right of people to vote. And so, a person that's in Congress is a representative of the people that have elected them. And that's the power: the people are the power. We've lost it, it's been lost because of and and many things in that area. And there's many attempts right now to abridge the vote even further. And so, he really feels like that we have got to regain more of the seats so that we can protect what he and his friends have fought so hard and given so much to give us, you know.\nSo, that's, I guess that's about as good of an answer I know I can give for him. We've been through this stuff so much now, I've almost got to memorise it.\n Alright. He's running as a Democrat in a house district which is controlled by Republicans since...\n He is a life-long Democrat, he's been very active in the Democratic Party; he was the chief of staff and the security officer for Dr Shirley McKellar who ran three times against down in , and he helped to organise East Texas, and he was very much in favour of Hillary Clinton, and so he was working to try to help, you know get out the vote for Hillary during those years that we was working down there. And he's participated in the state convention and in the .\n Alright, well, my question was he's running as a Democrat in a house district which has been controlled by Republicans since 1983, it's being contested by the Republicans and the Libertarians and an independent. Why do you think Texans would choose a Democrat this time?\n This district has been going . In , we made a turn in that district. In fact, the \u2014 Tarrant County is the largest part of the district, and it is now purple. The two smaller, in fact the last three elections the Democrats would have won if it hadn't been for the Republicans in the small rural counties of and . He lives in Midlothian, and that's the part of the county that is \u2014 Ellis County \u2014 that's been turning blue, and he has a lot of support in that part. And the Democrats that are running are not running against each other; they're running together. And they're not in there attacking each other, they're basically running together, and so the district has been turning steadily blue. There's enough people that are, there's been, you know, it's a matter of building infrastructure. You build political infrastructure year after year after year, and I believe they really began building that political infrastructure in in that district, and it's been by certain, it's been by candidates that have run and lost, but they have put certain things in place that the next one can deal with. And so, there's a possibility. It's not a done deal.\nBut this district, in case you remember, this is a district that ; Phil Gramm was a Republican who went to work for \u2014 he lost, he ran for Congress as a Republican and lost, he went to work for a Democrat. Then, he ran as a Democrat and won, and then he immediately went in and partnered with Ronald Reagan to get passed. And, he made mad, and he pulled him off of all of his committees, and he took his marbles and became a Republican, it's been Republican ever since. Trickle-down economics has not worked in that district. The district, especially the two rural counties have got poorer and poorer ever since that happened, and one of the things that really caused that is that trickle-down economics and also the GOP that had no-strings-attached meant that companies no longer invested in employees' education and training. They no longer had to invest in upgrading their infrastructure, on upgrading their own [...] on investing here in America. We lost American jobs, and Ellis and Navarro counties are two counties where they really have lost a lot of jobs. And, there's been a lot of things that have happened in that district: the housing costs have gone up rapidly, they have less access to healthcare.\nSo, there's been a real price. Now, there's also , who was of course Phil Gramm's , and Ron Wright was Joe Barton's chief of staff during a large part of the time that Joe was on the . And the main thing Joe did was protect the energy companies. And here in January, we had a very bad , and the protection that had been given to the energy companies really meant that a lot of Texans really lost their life, and many others basically lost, you know, were out in the cold literally; because they didn't force them to winterise, they set up a scheme to where if they didn't produce the energy \u2014 if you don't deliver energy you can profiteer and charge much . \nSo, some people are waking up on this. There's also, there are people that are very staunch, this particular race in particular, you have a real divide between those that are all for Donald Trump and those that aren't. All twelve of the Republicans voted for Donald Trump in November. There's only \"one\" out of the twelve that says he no longer deserves to be the leader of the party because of January 6. So, you have a real agreement on Trump's policies, and you also have a great many of them that really believe that the insurrection was just right, you know it was just fine and dandy. There are a lot of people that don't believe that, and so that's basically what we're saying, you know, is that there's a difference in, and there's a difference in ideology, there's a difference in thought. \nNow, no one can say that he's anti-law enforcement because he \"is\" law enforcement. No one can say he's anti-military because he is military. He's not anti-gun; he is in favour of background checks and controls on assault weapons, but you know this is someone that is the very fabric of this nation. But yet at the same time, he values civil rights; he worked for immigration for a brief period of time but he's flown the entire border. He's also been down in Central America so he understands what the root causes are. That's why these people are coming across the border now. He sees that there's no simple fix and he knows that it's not the policy of the current administration that's causing that. He knows that these are factors that would have driven them north no matter who was president.\nAnd, there are situations that we've got to change. So I think that there are enough people that these issues resonate with now, that they may have been oblivious to them before January and before the storm in February, but they're not as oblivious as they were before. I think there's some Republicans that will stay home. And this is also another different story. Usually a Congressional race is only in November. This is a local race. We have no way of knowing what's going to happen, because most of the people that vote in the primary and in the general election never show up and vote in a local election. So, it's going to be real interesting to see what happens with this one. I've worked a lot of elections, but this one is the strangest I've ever come across.\nBut basically, if you look at the demographics, the district has been steadily turning blue.\n All right. Moving on to the reason of course that this election was called at all, the death of Mr Ron Wright, what does he feel about his governance \u2014 the governance of the late Ron Wright?\n Ron Wright was the in for a number of years, and at the same time he was the chief of staff of Joe Barton. So, Ron Wright is basically just a shadow of Joe Barton. He was only in office one year. He did not have the opportunity to really make his own mark on that area because, for one thing he was battling cancer, and he was denying COVID-[19] and ended up, you know, sadly dying from COVID-19. He was doing quite well, from what I understand in battling his cancer, and then he contracted COVID and was dead almost immediately. But he was very extremist in many areas. Mr Eddings is a very devout Christian, but he doesn't go around thumping the Bible, he doesn't go around using his religion as a tool. Ron Wright did.\nRon Wright as the, now, I don't know if Mr Eddings would say this, but I would say this, but as the tax collector of Tarrant County he had put on all the envelopes so when you got your tax notice from Tarrant County you got it and it said \". He had that clearly on the side of the vehicles, and I'm a Christian too but I don't think that was the appropriate thing to do in those places. And it was done in a very area, but also when he was the mayor pro tem of Arlington, he helped to push through a very extreme programme. The way they did that is that they came in, and they first of all leased the city's property, the county's property and the school district's property, and they had the flat prod[uction well]s and the already in all of these neighbourhoods. And then they came to the people and they said \"oh, if you don't sign the gas contract, we'll take the gas anyway.\" But, you know, you've already got this industrial waste dump in your neighbourhood. \nAnd so Arlington had, by the time he was no longer mayor pro tem, there were over 300 gas wells in the 99 square miles of Arlington. I used to live there, and I had to leave because I couldn't breathe, the air quality was so bad. I had watched our former Congressman, a wonderful man: , who was also a Democrat, then Republican, but I have watched him work for years for where we had a good , where you knew when you built a house what was going to be next to you. And in that one administration, you know, when Ron Wright was there, they managed to \u2014 and of course he was basically also working for Joe Barton \u2014 to push this through for the energy companies. And they basically just completely ruined the entire zoning of Arlington. And, you know, it's made a real problem for homeowners in that area. \nSo, there's a lot of problems with Ron Wright in what he did, and he basically did not do anything for the people. There wasn't anything that he fought, he voted time and time again against healthcare, and this district has a higher rate than most . It has a higher than most third-world countries: you're more likely to die within a year of giving birth if you're a woman living in Tarrant County than you are if you live in most African countries. So, he basically is voting against healthcare and voting against , saying that he's pro-life while he's putting in place policies that are causing women and babies to die, and not doing anything about it. \nHe didn't do anything about bringing good jobs to the area, he was so determined to use Joe Barton's vote to protect the companies that he didn't do anything about \u2014 he kept their in place, and did nothing to subsidise the new industries that could create jobs for people. And so, these are some of the problems, what he failed to do. And then, the way he managed to, you know, who his friends were. And there is a place for \u2014 Daryl Eddings is not anti-, he's not anti-energy, he just says, you know, we've got energy companies that have been here for a long time, we don't need to subsidise them. They're already here. \nWhat we need to do is we need to go in and help the new industries get started so people can have new jobs that are here, and we need to revise our tax code and restore, you know, the top per cent shouldn't have the amount of tax breaks they have. We have to get a working again. He would prefer to see us go back to the policies that were similar to what had, you know. Eisenhower put in the and it opened commerce for the nation. We've got to put in a really robust Internet system so that people can work at home. In Ellis and Navarro County, there were lots of people that their kids couldn't study at home because they didn't have the Internet connectivity. People have trouble working from home because the Internet is so slow. We've got to get it to where every home in America has reliable connectivity so that we can move into the new way of working and the new way of studying. \n What are some of the most pressing issues Mr Eddings would raise to Congress if elected?\n Healthcare. Housing \u2014 affordable housing. Healthcare, housing and education. The cost of healthcare, housing and education has escalated much more rapidly than peoples' paycheques. We also have to address the national debt; the way we do that is to get people at work, at good-paying jobs. People say \"oh, $15 \", well he's not just interested in a $15 minimum, he's interested in people who are not working to be able to get a good-paying job. And then, the ones that are working, to have an opportunity to get the college and the training that they need, so they can qualify for higher-paying jobs. \nSo, if we get people back to work, and then we get people that are underemployed employed better, and have a . Most people don't have a career ladder anymore. I'm an old woman and there was a career ladder when I was starting out, but you know, when you create a world like has been created by Phil Gramm and Ronald Reagan and those that have followed them, where independent contractors are about the best you can get, that you can get your college degree and you can be one of the best data people in the world but you're competing with people on the other side of the world, and the employers here are hiring them in India, in China, instead of hiring them here in your own community. We've got to change that. What we have done with our computer jobs, we're going to have new industry technologies that we haven't even thought of, and they're going to be the jobs that are going to employ the next generation. We have to make sure that those and those jobs are here in America. \nIf we do the R&amp;D [research and development], we need to get them and have them here in America. And the only way you do that is by revising the tax code so that it's not an incentive to invest abroad, but there is an incentive to invest here, and to invest in research and development and upgrading technology and \"employees\", you know, in the training and the education of your employees. These are things that need to be restored to the tax code, and it can be done out of that percentage of tax that has been gained, has been given in these Republican tax cuts recently that have given us such a hard time. And when we do that, that's going to go ahead and help us rebuild the middle class, and it will help us get over the debt that we're going to have to go into to take care of COVID-19.\n Your website states \"Tea Party Republicans have neglected residents\" and \"Ronald Reagan's trickle-down economics leaves too many people out in the cold\". Could you please elaborate?\n Quite truthfully. And a lot of what I was just saying. Trickle-down economics was originally when Phil Gramm and Ronald Reagan basically said \"we're going to start giving tax cuts to industry because if we give a tax cut to industry, then the businesses, their profits will trickle down.\" But it didn't work that way. They gave the no-strings-attached tax breaks, and instead industry either \u2014 the people that got the tax breaks \u2014 either just banked it, and usually , or they invested out shore, instead of investing here. So, that's where we are. And in doing that, we lost those jobs. There were lots of people in Ellis and Navarro counties that had union jobs, they had , they had retirement, they had training, they had healthcare and they knew that they had a job for as long as they did a decent job. And all those jobs have just gone away.\nBut the others didn't come in, you know, they really did not come forward. Now, Daryl Eddings is a owner, and so, you know, he's not anti-business. But he comprehends that we have got to be able to get our American workforce with some level of protection, and the way we have to do that is we have to outfit investment: we have to invest in our own workforce, and people aren't going to do that unless, you know, it's a shame that it's and wisely, they're not doing it. But what we've found is we've found a lot more of these businesses have just been sold, you know, off by, you know, somebody buy it and then sell it to make a profit, buy it and sell it to make a profit, buy it and sell it to make a profit, take all the profit out of the good ones.\nThere's nothing left for the people. A good example is \"media; a very good example\". I started out in newspaper when I was a young woman, and we never made a lot of money in newspaper, we thought we had a hard time but as I have watched colleagues of mine that work for the and the and these others: every time their newspaper gets sold, they get less and less and less. And also, it's now gotten somewhere they have cut. There are very few newspapers in the United States that really even have an team. And of course, everybody else always, which, the newspapers find out what the background was before they got on the television and they got on the radio, and so it's hurting on almost every level, but that's just one example.\nWe've got to get to the point where we have a tax code that encourages people to invest in our companies here, and invest in our workforce here. And where workers and where companies look up and say \"you know, our workers are valuable.\" And it used to be that way. Workers used to be: you wanted to retain your workers, you didn't want to just have them be a contractor and walk away. And so we've gone over the cheap and it's cost us dearly. And it was very obvious with COVID. We didn't have the in place to be able to have the equipment we needed to take care of our people. \nSo, it's a national security issue, it's a jobs issue, it's an economy issue, it's a moral issue and it's not right for the middle class to be the one that's bearing the of the taxes, and those who are the most wealthy not paying their fair share. So, you know, and of course, Donald Trump always talked about \"I paid all these taxes\". Well, he's talking about . He didn't pay any income taxes, he paid employee taxes: that was the money he collected from the employees out there with only! [Laughs] It wasn't his paid taxes, you know! And so they look at it and say \"well, I want the cheque\".\nAnd I've been a business owner too. I know how hard it is to write those cheques when it's time to pay your employee interest. But your employee taxes, it's not employment taxes, you know; what you collect from your employees you're passing on. We've got to get to the point where it's not the employees that are bearing the brunt of it. We need to share it around better, we need to be fair, it needs to be more equitable. And so this is something that's going to have to be debated, and it's not going to be popular, but it has got to be done. People have got to stop running away from that, and face it: that we do not have a workable tax code.\nAnd there's things that we get in place, and they're myths that have existed in this country about Ronald Reagan that the facts don't back up. And we need to go back honestly and look at the facts, and see what happened and where it started \u2014 and it really started with Ronald Reagan and Phil Gramm right here in US Texas 6, and I would like to see it end in US Texas 6. And let's have a new beginning. People will come in and really look at, and it will be better for Democrats, it will be better for Republicans, it will be better. \nAnd he's not running just to represent Democrats \u2014 he's running to represent people. He will be there for whoever. He will be there for whoever. He's not going to be there patting people on the back if they say that it was an illegal election because it wasn't an illegal election. Once you have exhausted all of the legal appeals, recounts and you've gone through the courts, then you accept the outcome. You don't go in and try to the security officers at the Capitol, because your guy didn't win! I've been very unhappy many, many, many times when the election results came in, but I never went out and was violent, I never went out and committed treason, you know, I never tried to do a . That's what we saw happen in January, and it's really time to bring that back, yeah.\nWe need people in office that will not be leading tours of the Capitol for people who are planning on coming in and kidnapping the Speaker of the House and the Vice President of the United States, to keep from the certification of votes. This is the reality, you know. We have Texas, we have congressmen from Texas that literally led tours the day before that insurrection, and it was a time when the Capitol was supposed to be closed; there were not supposed to be any tours! The only ones that were on tours were these people that were, you know, yelling with Trump. And so, we've got to get back and change that around.\nThe other thing that's really important is we've got to stop dark money in our elections, we've got to \u2014 and this is a very bipartisan area, the don't like it, but they have done surveys of most of the Republicans, and most of the Republican base said \"we need to know who the millionaires are that are financing our elections; we need the .\" That's a very bipartisan issue. He's very much for revoking and getting dark money out of Congress, out of our elections, and we need to have an independent body, an independent body, not elected officials draw the barriers, the boundaries. Elected officials picking their voters is not how this was supposed to work, you know. That's not how we're supposed to be doing it, and so there's some things that need to be done on election reform, and they're reasonable things.\nAnd I think in the long run, a lot of Republicans will buy into it. The people in the glass room, some of them in the office won't because it, you know, it protects them in office. But we need to get it to where we're really protecting the people, not protecting the ones who are in front of us. \n Your website also [says]: \"I served within the chain of command under the commander-in-chief, but I did not swear an oath to any one man or political party.\" Could you please elaborate on that?\n Okay, there are a lot of people, as of January 6, that are putting Donald Trump \u2014 and I mean, this is appalling to see what some of the churches have been doing \u2014 they've been putting the up there like he is some ; and there are members of Congress that, instead of recognising how serious it was, they have been very frightened of going against Trump. Several of the Republicans have stated that if it had been a , that they would have voted to remove him. The repercussions, you know, the repercussions on it. Donald Trump is not to who we swear. You don't swear a to the president of the United States. The commander-in-chief is charged with leading our military, but our military swears an oath to protect and defend the Constitution of the United States. And that's also the oath that the president takes, and that's what Congress takes.\nBut instead of looking at what we do to protect the Constitution of the United States, which was to have a peaceful turnover of the government, there were too many of them that continued to say \"this is an illegal election\", \"it was not fair\", you know, and even though the judges by and large were Republican appointees by Donald Trump, they were saying \"oh this isn't fair, some Democrats have done it\", they put out too many lies and they instigated a level of doubt and discord and disharmony that destabilises our country \u2014 and actually led to a large number of people, many of whom were law enforcement agents, and many of whom were veterans that stormed the Capitol with a military plan. It was very clearly executed, this was not spontaneous, it was a plan to go in and forcibly stop the certification of the vote to turnover the presidency to the man who had won the election. And this is not how it's supposed to work.\nEvery one of those people in that building has sworn an oath to the Constitution of the United States, and the Constitution of the United States outlines what the process is when we have a question about it, how we answer it, what the process is with the courts. And when it is settled, which it had been, we peaceably turnover power to the next elected administration. It always has been that way except under Donald Trump. \nDaryl Eddings came back from Iraq in a coma. He spent eighteen months in a military hospital undergoing multiple surgeries and years of rehab to get to the point where he could work and make a living for his family. He lost people over there that he cares about who were fighting for this country, and for him to sit there and watch what happened on January 6, and to hear the words that came out of the mouth of Ted Cruz and Donald Trump and and a lot of other elected officials that basically were lies. He knows what it is to be in countries where there are palace coups. And to sit here and see this going on in his own country? Can you imagine what kind of a \"reaction\" he has? Can you imagine how it hits him in the gut? How he would decide to put his life on the line?\nThis is a man that has always been very private. There were very few photographs of him because he was a , and he worked on drug interdiction, and he knew that there were people that might recognise him from those missions that were not nice people. And he didn't want them knocking on his door with his family. And he sat down and talked to his family about it and decided to put his face out there, and put his name out there and run for Congress because his \"that\" worried about where our nation is right now. He's that worried for his neighbours: Democrats and Republicans, independents and Libertarians.\n How would Mr Eddings handle the vaccine rollout if elected?\n He's very pleased with how President Biden has done it. The vaccine rollout has been \u2014 Donald Trump was good about getting it on making it, but he did not have in place a real plan to distribute it. Daryl Eddings, he spent, you know years in emergency management, you know. He's been working on another Master's [degree] in emergency management, but he would be working very much like what President Biden has been doing. He'd be working with the scientists, he would be working with the supply chain, he'd be working with the military, he'd be working with the nurses to get it out to as many people as possible as fast as possible, and as efficiently as possible. And that's one thing he's very efficient is when there's something that needs to be done, he knows how to move the people and move the resources and assess the problem and get the job done. \nAnd so on that area, he's been much more relieved to see what has happened this year than what we were watching last year. \n How would Mr Eddings help the economically disadvantaged if elected?\n Jobs. Very definitely jobs. Jobs and access to education, and also expansion of healthcare. Right here in Texas, the and the Governor refused to expand but we're basically paying for other states to have Medicaid! There's so many things: everybody that has held a private policy is paying a higher premium because we have so many uninsured people in Texas. He would be working to, you know, to expand it, to look at the ACA [Affordable Care Act], see what the problems are instead of revoking it like Joe Barton has tried to do; he would basically be working to look at it, to see what the problems are and to find a solution to make it work for as many people as possible \u2014 not to eliminate the options for private healthcare, not at all \u2014 but yet to give more people an opportunity to.\nAlso, he would be looking for ways that people could have an opportunity to buy a home again. Housing cost is a big problem. We have too many families that are being pushed out of their housing, and we have too many veterans living under the bridges, and he has worked on veterans' housing with a number of non-profit organisations for years; that's been one of the things that he's worked very heavily on is veterans' housing. And, he also has been very active on veterans' mental health issues, and so a lot of families are suffering because of mental health issues and they don't have the opportunity to have the on demand that they need there. If there's a long waiting list for it, when you get ready for it there's a waiting list, and you know with an addict, somebody that has a problem, if you don't strike when the striking is hot, if they have to wait then they're not ready to go in and do anything about it.\nAnd so that's one of the big problems he'd be working with, very much. He's done a lot on and mental health issues and [post-traumatic stress disorder]. And these are issues that are not Democratic or Republican, they're not black, they're not white: these are problems that, because every time we have a lot of veterans that come home, and then there are a lot of us that are suffering from PTSD that were in military, you know, they are military things; people that have been in or in different areas of that area have PTSD. And so, we need a better network, a better social network.\nAnd then, we also have to strengthen our retiree social network. \"Retired\" people shouldn't be paying some out of their Social Security cheque, and when somebody has been working for a company they should be able to take their retirement plan with them. And what we've allowed is in there are too many cases of corporations declaring bankruptcy to get out of paying the retirement for their employees, and then they leave it to the federal government to take up the slack. We may need to go with something like what we have for where there's an insurance: it's an insurance policy instead of a pension plan, and that it goes with the employee wherever they're going, so that after you've worked twenty years if you've worked at five or six or seven different jobs, you still have some .\nAnd we have to keep Social Security, you know. Social Security is a \u2014 we can't do it, but the way we do that is by putting in work, you know. People have to work: them ore we work, the more we pay in, the stronger these systems are. But as long as our jobs are offshore, as long as employers can just, you know, call you in as an independent contractor and let you go, you know, whenever it suits them and not, you know, not in that area, as long as we have no protection for our employees and there's no investment by the companies into our workforce, we're not going to have the resources we need for people to have the retirement as necessary. \nHouses, jobs, retirement, access to infrastructure, health rights: those are the things that everybody needs. Those are not Democrat needs, and Republican doesn't. Those are the things everybody needs, and that is exactly what he is, that's exactly what he'll be working for. And also, everybody's vote must count, and we need to know that it's counted fairly, and that when that election is over that you can go through the process and you may find out that some of it was wrong and you can correct it, but if you find out that it wasn't wrong, then you just, you know, you just take it on your chin and you just wait for the next election. That's the American Way, and that's where we need to go back to.\n What are his opinions on President Biden?\n He is relieved to see the things that President Biden has been doing. He feels like reversing most of President Trump's executive orders was a good move. He is pleased to see the calibre of people with experience to accept the mission of the departments they're being appointed to, that'll be his appointees, you know. Because we found under Trump people that had no credentials whatsoever were appointed, that was mainly , and they were appointed to destroy the departments, not to build them up. Daryl Eddings believes in good government, not no government. That doesn't mean that government gets to do everything, you know, but basically we always try to do better. \nWe had a bureaucracy that basically, our civil service was designed so that it didn't, you know, the civil service and the worked for us; my mother was still in civil service. I didn't even know she was a Democrat until she was dying, I thought she had voted Republican until she was on her deathbed because she took the Hatch Act so seriously. [Laughs] She didn't even let her kids know what her partisanship was. But because a federal employee is supposed to be non-partisan in the way they conduct their business, we had a steady transition, and we also had experts who knew what was going on, was there to continue running things until the next one is in place. That's been really tattered and shattered, you know, in so many areas.\nOne good example is the , you know, the post office department. There's no for-profit business that's ever going to make profit serving every community in the nation, you know. No company is going to make a profit serving every community in the nation. And yet at the same time, they're going out of their way to destroy the United States Postal Office that basically services every community in the nation. And so, we have to go back in and look at that, so it's good.\nHe's for people that are science, data, look at the facts, go with the facts, use your science, use your data, rely on the experts, get the politics out of it and make the decision based off what will work. That's Daryl Eddings. Make the decision based on truth, the best information available, verify it and put people in charge that have a background and the expertise to do the job, and who believe that the mission, as is set out in our legislation of that agency, is what they really have a commitment to. If they don't have a commitment to the mission of that agency, they should not be put in charge of that agency. And so he sees Biden trying to do that, you know, more so. And in the last administration, they wouldn't.\n Well, we've talked about Mr Biden, so what are Mr Eddings' thoughts on former President Trump?\n Oh...he never called him the commander-in-chief, as he was out of the military by the time, he was retired by the time he came in, but he never called him the commander-in-chief, he called him '45' because he never earned his respect. There was not any reason for Donald Trump to be leading our troops. Donald Trump was putting too many people at risk on a whim without reading the intelligence briefings, without listening to his generals, without, you know, unless it was an that was feeding his ego, he had no time for it. And it was dangerous, it was dangerous. He's relieved that he's no longer, you know, I mean it's not that he was a Republican, it was that he was a danger, and that he was a danger to this nation, he was a danger to the men and women who are putting their lives on the line to watch out for us. \nAnd also, he violated some of our greatest allies, you know. The things that he did to our allies was unconscionable, and it wasn't just the ones that were our peacetime allies; he basically betrayed some of our allies when they were, with their lives were in danger and they were literally fighting for their very lives. And so the betrayals, you know, it's very difficult for a man who has had the kind of life that Daryl Eddings has to watch what happened under Donald Trump, and not be appalled.\n What are his thoughts on the ongoing crisis at the Southern border?\n Well, he worked for immigration. And, at the same time he understands, and then he also worked on drug interdiction, so he's flown from the top to the bottom, but he's also been in those countries. And he knows that it's not what our policy is that is bringing them here. What's bringing them here is what's happening in their countries. It's the terror, the crime, the severe poverty and it was bad enough because they're always having hurricanes and disasters, they're just knocking them off the line, but when you get down to it you also have COVID-19 that's on top of it. But he knows that if someone is terrified, and they believe that they or their children are going to die if they stay in their neighbourhood, they're going to go somewhere else. And, they're not going to be able to keep them back; they're going to go wherever it is they think that they will be safer \u2014 maybe not safe, but safer.\nSo he knows that those are situations that \u2014 it's a humanitarian problem, but it's going to have to be solved on a multi- attack. It has to be solved in co-operation with the countries to help the countries counter the drug and the terror and the gang activity. They also have to be helped in a way that deals with the poverty. And then, we have to be as humane as we can in receiving those who came. We had four years of the United States government refusing to process asylum applications in a timely manner. We were already understaffed before this happened, and then he made that to try to make it as a punishment. You can't make it as a punishment.\nHe also knows that there is no way to put a up, because he's flown from the Pacific Ocean to the Gulf of Mexico; just the terrain would make it totally impossible. And besides that, what are you going to do with a fence when you have two oceans on both sides of you, you know. So you're not going to keep people over. The higher the fence, they're going to come over. So, we have to find a way. But as a law enforcement officer, he really believes we have to be able to allow the people who are here to come out of the shadows, because as long as we have people in the shadows, and they're afraid to co-operate with law enforcement, it's harder to take care of the drug dealers in the , and it's harder to take care of criminals that are preying on them. \nAnd as long as a criminal can prey on somebody, and there's somebody there that was a witness or a victim, and they can't co-operate with law enforcement, we're all less safe. So, we have to do something to give them a chance to have so they're not afraid of being deported, so that they can co-ordinate with law enforcement here, and he sees that as a real nice thing. And he did go down to with ACLU [American Civil Liberties Union] when they were under the Trump Administration; he actually went into the courtroom and saw children that were being brought before the court, without an adult. He saw multiple immigrants, multiple people that were in orange shirts, orange sheets that were teetered together, they will all fly together as a mass thing to be deported, not even having an individual chance before a judge. He saw things that were not fine, as a criminal justice person, that was not fair, and that were not humane.\nAnd what's happening now is very sad, but they're at least trying to take care of these children, they're trying to move them out of those shelters as fast as possible, they're trying to get them, they're trying to speed up the background checks \u2014 that's one of the big problems: they \"have\" to do background checks on these people that are coming forward to be their guardians, because they're children that have literally ended up being sex trafficking by people who claimed them, so you have to do that. It's not an instant process, but yet at the same time what you do with those children, and the mental health support that they have while they're in there, you don't go in there and tell them that their parents have deserted them. You don't lie to the parents and tell them, you know, those things, so we have to be honest, we have to be truthful with the people, we have to do the best job we can do, and our best job isn't good enough, but in the last administration it was cruel! You know, it wasn't that it wasn't good enough, it was that it violated the in almost every way.\nAnd also, we test them. You know, they were refusing even to give those kids under Trump. We test them, and, you know, we do our best to take care of them, and we try to get them out of our custody as fast as possible, because the more you have together, the higher likelihood of sexual assault, or violence, or harm to one of them. And so, you have to process them, and get them out as fast as possible, and protect them because, you know, it's just a nightmare. But yeah, he was very concerned for the children; he's got seven grandchildren of his own, and what he saw as a former [Immigration and Naturalization Service] person knows that was not how it was supposed to operate. And it still has a ways to go now, but at least they're trying to do it, instead of trying to do the opposite.\n What are his thoughts on the size of the American military?\n That's one question that we haven't discussed: about the size of the military. I can't really give you an answer. I do know that he believes very much in the military, he believes in the military; it is a peacekeeping operation, he believes that it is beneficial in that it is one of the ways that people who come from poorer families can get an education, can have a chance to buy a house with a reasonable area, you know. If you live through your military service, you have benefits, but also there's a lot of people that do not survive their military service. \nHe doesn't believe that the military should be used for everything, you know. We have reasons to use the military; we don't use the military just at the whim of the commander-in-chief. There has to be a valid reason to use the military, and so that's one of the reasons that he trusted Hillary Clinton more than he trusted Donald Trump, you know, on that area. \n What are his thoughts on the criminal justice system?\n Well, he was an officer, of course. He believes in it, and he also believes that we have many wonderful law enforcement people, and we have some bad apples. We have too many racists that are in the, you know. do not belong in law enforcement. There are some people that do not have the temperament to be in law enforcement. And he became a friend of 's mother during the time that she was trying to find out what happened to her daughter, what the real circumstances were of her , and he has looked very closely with her, over the years, that she actually came to Texas in 2018, I guess it was; maybe this was '16, 2018, and volunteered in Dr Shirley McKellar's campaign because of the relationship they established.\nHe was very pleased to see the Sandra Bland Act signed into law by Governor [Greg] Abbott. It does some things that are important; he would like to see the Act and the Sandra Bland Act, those elements of it be merged and passed nationally. The Sandra Bland Act has transparency, it has a lot of protection, it has a lot of things in dealing with the mentally ill and drug addiction; very often a jailer would just say they had gone by and checked on them when they didn't, so it calls for electronic monitoring so they have to push the button right there at the cell to show that they have checked on that person. It basically says that if there's ever a death in custody that you don't get to investigate it yourself, it has to be an independent law enforcement agency to do the investigation.\nSo those are the protections. Then, the George Floyd Act has some others that are important too; now the George Floyd Act basically goes in and says if there is a registry, then we need to have a registry of law enforcement officers that have been discharged because of not following the protocol. And so that's pretty controversial with it, but he also believes that we have to go in and address; he believes that everyone should be able; he believes in protecting the rights, obviously, he is a gun owner. \nBut, he believes that there are s, he believes there are military weapons, and weapons that can be modified to be military weapons, that belong on the battlefield, and that and should be used for hunting game, not hunting people. They shouldn't be worn around as a fashion statement into restaurants to intimidate other diners. We need to be able to have everyone licensed, everyone background-checked, everyone to have training. And we have to close the loopholes of gun purchases. There's still going to have the people that are getting a hold of the weapons illegally, but if you take care of that, you can then address the others. But, law enforcement are designed to shoot to kill if there is a threat: that's their protective life.\nHe believes that we have got to stop using our police for everything that we haven't got covered. They're not supposed to be the box we check when we don't have anything else to do it. Every call should not be going to the police. If it's mental health, drug addiction, we should have people who are trained in mental health and trained in drug addiction do the first call on that. You might have a police officer with you, but you shouldn't, you know, those tiny areas. \nHe serves on the Mental Health Advocacy Board; he's an officer on that. He works as a mentor, he volunteers as a mentor in a one-year programme, it's called the \"Veterans Court\" in Dallas, where you work with someone who has been in drug addiction or mental, you know, has just gotten in trouble with the law, and it's aversion programme, and you have a mentor and you work with that person 24/7 wherever they need them, and he does that. He works from down in East Texas, they realised that there were thirteen counties that did not have access to in-person psychiatric counselling, and social work counselling. He worked to see that they got it, and that the VA paid for it, so yeah, he has some real, real concerns with what's happening with the mentally ill, and the people that are falling through the cracks.\nHe knows that he's where he's at because people helped him when he came back, you know. And he sees a lot of veterans that are falling through the cracks, and he's very concerned about that. And then, there are other people that are falling through the cracks. And so, law enforcement, you know, law enforcement needs. And also, he's a black man. He's got black grandchildren. He's a law enforcement person; you know, the bias that goes, the more likely you're going to be shot by a police officer if you're mentally ill, or you're a . Those are things that would concern any father, any grandfather.\nAnd yet at the same time, the officers shouldn't have, you know, if an officer is at greater risk of being killed now because of the number of guns that are out there. How do you know, if you're in a grocery store, and someone comes in with a gun, if they're coming in just because they've got a licence and they're just shopping, or if they're coming in to do something. We used to be able to know that if somebody came into with a gun, they didn't have a good purpose, you know. They can stop them close to do the door. Now, they're right up on the aisle with you, before you get a chance; they're right up on top of you, able to do a lot of damage. So, there's a lot more risk to law enforcement right now than there was before, we have to address it on both ways.\n What does he feel on Medicare?\n Medicare? The best, most efficiently-managed healthcare delivery in the nation. It's not perfect, but it is definitely, when you look at the cost of administration for Medicare, it is the lowest of any insurance company, any insurance divider; even military is not as efficiently run as Medicare. But, he would like to look at possibly a buy-in for people that are 50, to where some people might be able to buy into it; he's not sure, but he thinks that something should be evaluated. He wants to put on the table of our system, and look at what the flaws are, see where we started with the Affordable Care Act, what we know now are the problems, the inequities, see how we can correct those, and how we can get more people covered, and it is by making Medicare go a little bit longer, or if it's a way of jacking up the Affordable Care Act.\nBut also, he believes that people should have dental coverage, you know. That's a way to find a way to make dental coverage affordable. So, you know, there's a lot of that's caused because of bad dentistry, and there's a lot of people that can't afford to go to the dentist, and it concerns him that people are working and they can't afford to, you know, they're too poor to go to the dentist when they need to, they're too poor to go to the doctor, they're too poor to get that psychiatric counselling that they need. And so, the way that we do this is we invest in our people, and that's one of the investments in the people.\nWe also have to see how do we pay for it. And that's the other chance it is not an easy solution. We have to look at what we can do, and what's reasonable and how do we pay for it. And those are questions that, instead of fighting over it we need to come to the table and \"solve\", you know. Really look at them, and debate them, and research them and solve them instead of just asking the book when we're with them. He's a person that basically looks at it, listens and figures out a way to get it done. And he's done that since he's left \u2014 he's done that when he was in the military, and he's done it since he left the military. Operation Battle Buddy is an example, because when he was with \u2014 now, there's two organisations: this isn't the , this is the one that does the mentoring, but he founded that organisation. When he was the CEO of it, they were mentoring 20 thousand vets that had, you know, come through Brooke Military Hospital.\nBut he looks at it, he sees a need and he finds a way to get it done: that's what they need down in East Texas with the mental health services, and that's what he's done with some veterans' housing projects in different areas. So, and that's just as an individual. And so, as a congressperson I believe that he has the relationship with a number of people in Congress, and they'll look at him and they'll see his heart, and see his skill and see his willingness to solve problems. You know, you gravitate together: those who are really wanting to find solutions find ways to find solutions, and that's where he'll be; he'll be with the ones that are looking to find the solution.\n What are his thoughts on President Biden's recent talks with China [on March 19, 2021]?\n I don't know, we haven't talked about that. So that's one, on all these mountains and mountains of things we have not talked about China, other than what's happened with trade. So, I can't even answer that one.\n What are his thoughts, then, on the rise in as and recent ?\n Oh, it's deplorable. Hate and discrimination coming against any person is an abomination to him. He considers one of his proudest moments was when he was on the with the late honourable . He does not believe in, you know, I mean if you're Muslim, if you're Asian, if you're LGBT, if you're a woman, if you're black, if you're Hispanic, you're an American, and you should be treated with respect as a human being. And no one, in this country of any race is responsible for COVID-19. Nobody here caused it, nobody here brought it over here, you know, there's some people that are responsible for not helping us deal with it in a timely \"manner\", you know, there's some people that dropped the ball on it, but we did not cause it. And just because of your ethnicity, you know, you definitely should not in that area, so the discrimination in the attacks on them are very troubling.\n The power outages of February left millions without power, sometimes for days, including of course, the sixth district. Its damages are currently estimated at US$195 billion and 111 estimated to have been killed. How will Mr Eddings prevent this from happening again, should he be elected?\n On the federal level: require all energy transmission sites to be listed and winterised. Without protecting them out on the cheap, you know. I mean, instead of just keeping them from having to do that, here in Texas, we know that there's a piece of paper. They can just have them listed of which ones were supposed to get that, and also they did not have the winterisation. Our pipelines should have been buried deeper, but the pipelines doesn't require it. So, on a federal level we're probably going to have to go in and put some controls in on a federal level to address these issues, these issues.\nAnd also, there has to be some kind of control put in on the profiteering schemes of energy. Here in Texas, Joe Barton, Greg Abbott and certain legislators have done their very best to protect their big donors at the expense of everybody else, and it's cost people lives. And you know, now Abbott's trying to deflect from it, you know, he's sent people down to the border, he's tried all kinds of things. He's done his math bit, all this stuff to deflect from the fact that he really blew it...but he really blew it, and he basically \u2014 they sat there and they knew, they knew from 2011 what was going to happen. They were told in 2011 what they needed to do, and every year in January my electric bill always jumped up even though I didn't use any more electricity.\nAnd every Texan has paid through the nose because they have willingly taken compression stations offline so they could get those higher prices in January, and this time it crashed. And they still got them, you know. Two and three and sometimes even a thousand per cent higher: that's profiteering, that's schemes, and that has to do with the failure of politicians to look out for the people of Texas. And the buck rests not just with the [Public Utility Commission of Texas] and not just when what was left, the buck rests with the Governor, and with certain people who have been in office that have been the real protectors of that sector at all costs. That sector is an important sector, but they should not be allowed to profiteer at the expense of the Texas citizens.\n What sets Mr Eddings apart from other candidates in the Democratic Party; of course, there are multiple running, there are multiple Democrats, multiple Republicans, multiple everyone. So, what sets him apart?\n There are some others that are veterans that are running on the Democrat and Republican sides, but none of them have the width of experience he has. None of them have the experience in emergency management. It was really a[n] eye-opener for me during Hurricane Katrina when I realised that I couldn't just call the people that were running the show in Arlington while we were receiving them, because they were locked in a, you know, in a secure area and the public had no access to the telephone in that area. A state of emergency, which is is a very serious thing, and most citizens don't understand what happens during that.\nHe does, because he has worked states of emergency for years in California, and then the senior operations officer over there, so if something happens in the district and he's in Congress he's going to know what's happening, he's going to be able to put his hands on them, he's going to be able to know who to contact, how to contact them, what to look for, what usually happens where the break-down is, to take care of things: that's the level that he has. Also, he comes with them. This is a personal situation: I travelled with him a lot, and he was the security person on our team. And usually, we never, you know usually, if there was something we wanted it was no problem, but if it was something that had to do with security we always knew that if he nodded or said no that it was no, because he is always looking out for the security of everyone around him.\nIf you're in his neighbourhood, he's going to be as concerned about your security as he is going to be about his own wife's security. That's where he looks at. He looks at what is going to keep people alive, and at the same time respect their freedom to be the very best that they can be. That's how he is. He is the most \u2014 I'll tell you, he's a hard candidate to work for, because he's so modest! You know, I mean he's unlike any politician I've ever worked with because he's not a politician, he is a person that is \u2014 he's usually finding solutions and pulling other people together to make them happen, and then he pushes them to the foreground but doesn't take any credit for what he instigated, for what he did. \nHe's not out there to take vows for himself, he's out there to make things better. He \"sincerely\" is out there to make things better. You know, of course that's coming from somebody who knows him, and I wouldn't be doing this \u2014 I would not be doing this if I didn't know him as well as I do, because basically I said \"I'm not doing this again!\" I've done enough of that, you know, it's time for somebody else to look to own this ship, but yeah, he's just, he's a very rare individual. \nAnd also, in the years I have known him I have never once had something the man told me that I couldn't take at face. He has never even covered up, you know, I mean he might not say anything about it but there's never been one field, one attempt to misdirect anyone I have ever seen in all the years I've known him. That's not something you come across in these politicians. I don't know how you put that in the story, but that's just not; he's just not your normal egg, you know. He's just not normal egg.\n How has COVID-19 affected the campaign?\n Oh, enormously. Because for one thing, : usually, you're out meeting people and rubbing hands and all that, and that's practically every interview, every meeting is by , you know, we're just now getting ready to starting with block walking where we're having to, you know, all of that we're trying to, you know, we'll try to get people vaccinated so that they can be out there. We've done the masks, social distancing and we have Dr McKellar, who is a [Registered nurse], who was a commander over military units in Iraq, in the Middle East, who has basically set down what our COVID-19 protocols are.\nIt makes all the difference in the world on how we did it; it made a big difference in just being able to file. Usually when you file, you go into different Democratic club meetings and you go to your neighbours, and you get your petition signatures. Well, when he said he was going to try and do petition signatures in three days during a pandemic, I said \"it couldn't happen\", but he got his veteran buddies out there and they basically collected the, you know 5500 signatures that we needed. We didn't use them, because we didn't have time to check them out to make sure they were valid, and we still paid the money but to be able to make contact with that many people is astronomical.\nSo, we're still doing the things that we can do, and you know, in next week we're going to actually start literature drops instead of, normally you go and you knock on the door, you try to talk to people, we're going to be trying to do literature drops. Somebody comes out and gets them to talk to them, but they'll be at distance and everybody'll have a mask and, you know, that whole kind of area. So, it makes it very different.\nAnd also, people are hurting, you know. We're dealing with people who are in greater need, even if they have the roof over their head and the money isn't the situation, they've got emotional needs, they've got psychological needs, they've got grieving needs that have gone on. And so, everyone is in a very different place this year than they were last year.\nAnd also, if it were not for COVID, two of the three seats that are coming up this month in Congress would not be having special elections. One of them in Louisiana was because the congressman took a job in the Biden administration, but the other one is because the died of COVID-19, and so did Ron Wright. So, COVID is making the difference politically and opening seats up, and that's not how you plan on running. It also means that this is the most complex election \u2014 we had fifty days to do what normally you do in eighteen months in a congressional race. And just to file the paperwork and get the checking account to do those kinds of things is astronomical.\nAnd also, a candidate usually has months in which to get his one minute, his two minute, his three minute , and to get all, you know all that kind of stuff, and to get the issues, and you did it all at the same time in very accelerated speeds. And you're running against \u2014 there's 23 people on the ballot, who knows what in the world that's going to do, and you can't judge, you can't go back and look at any other election and make a guess about what the turnout's going to be. Because, even if it was another special election it wouldn't have been a special election between these candidates, you know. And if it was a congressional race, it wouldn't have been a special election with your local candidate, so it's just a crapshoot, you know, who knows what's going to happen here.\nBut we do know this: that whatever we do, we will be building some infrastructure, we'll be identifying some voters, we will be engaging some voters that may not have been engaged, we will be bringing out some folks that voted in 2020 to a local election for a congressional race, and maybe some of these folks will get in the habit of voting in their municipal elections, and we have a difference, you know. And that may be a good one, because if they get in a habit when they're young, then maybe they'll continue doing that. So, you know, whatever happens \u2014 there's a good side and a difficult side anyway you check it.\n If Mr Eddings isn't elected this time, what do you anticipate his ambitions for the future would be?\n He's already said that he's running in 2022, you know, if he isn't elected. In fact, we had a discussion today about his filing his FEC [Federal Election Commission] intention to run, you know, and I put it out to him, you know \"you've already got your checking account, you've already got your ads clean, you've already got a lot of stuff done, and so, you know just go with it.\" Yeah, his intention is to run in the 20s, he's been thinking about running for a long time, he just hadn't thought about running this year because he didn't know this seat was going to be open.\n Light-hearted question to end this: which historical figure would he identify with most and why, or which historical figure do you think he identifies with most and why?\n Okay, he says the two that he admires most, and that he would rather fashion himself after would be John Lewis and Ruth Bader Ginsburg. And that is because they each faced great discrimination, they each persevered and they each opened doors to segments of people that many people thought would never be opened, and basically he said \"if it is necessary, it is not impossible.\" You can't afford for it to be impossible if it's something people desperately, finally need, and so you continue working for that as long as it takes to take care of it, and those are two conclusive of that, so he looks at that.\nThis man hasn't got a misogynistic bone in his body, I mean, it's just incredible, you know. I've asked him what he thought about Don't ask, don't tell in the military, and he said \"some of the best soldiers I've ever known: men and women were under don't ask don't tell, and it was good for them to be able to of the covers on that type area.\" He's not at all, he has no problems with LGBTQ in the military. And he also truly has no problems with women because he was staunchly behind Hillary Clinton, and he has put the last eight years of his life on hold to try to get Shirly McKellar elected over Louis Gohmert down in East Texas.\nSo, he just, you know, he's a rare bird.\n Any final comments?\n Well, I think I'm pretty well commented!

The statement further added: In our country, nutrition care of children is deemed a top priority despite difficult conditions and insufficiency.

In the report, Quintana said COVID-19 led to deaths by starvation following the decline in business. UN's report mentioned \"several individuals who were caught breaking anti-epidemic prevention measures were reportedly executed in public\". These alleged executions are said to have taken place in cities including the country's capital city, Pyongyang, where a man was allegedly executed for having partaken in 'illicit trade' with China, the report elaborated.\nIn a \"The Korea Times\" article, an unnamed non-governmental organisation said \"approximately 440 thousand children and pregnant and lactating women will not receive , approximately 95 thousand acutely malnourished children will not receive necessary treatment and approximately 101 thousand kindergarten-aged children will not receive \".\nBorder restrictions in North Korea have been implemented as a way to stop the spread of COVID-19, but the restrictions have caused shortages of necessary goods such as medicine, Reuters reported quoting Russia's diplomatic mission to North Korea. These shortages have caused an \"exodus\" of foreign diplomats leaving North Korea, the same report added."}

Ingenuity left the rover on Sunday, after which the rover moved away to expose Ingenuity's array to direct sunlight.\nThe NASA-Jet Propulsion Laboratory released a statement saying this was the first time Ingenuity survived the night by itself while being exposed to the planet atmosphere directly. In the statement NASA wrote this has confirmed they have \"the right insulation, the right heaters, and enough energy in its battery to survive the cold night, which is a big win for the team.\" The temperatures could go as low as -90 \u00b0 (-130 \u00b0), the statement said. The helicopter used the energy from its solar array to power a small heater and protect its electronics from the cold.\nMars just has 1% of atmosphere as compared to Earth. Ingenuity's propeller had to rotate about three times faster for flight on the Martian atmosphere as compared to flying on Earth, ABC News reported. Ingenuity has been designed to be light to make the takeoff easier. Its mass is about 1.8 kilograms. Tim Canham from NASA said \"The processor on the helicopter is about 100 times more powerful than the processor on the rover itself\".\nThe next step would be a blade movement test scheduled for today, CNN said. If successful, it would be followed by first flight test, which can take place by Sunday. That would be the first powered, controlled flight on another planet. Five flights were expected to occur in the next 31 days. If successful, they would be followed by further movement of the helicopter, as it would collect samples of rocks, and collect photos of its observations. Throughout the entire duration of research, Ingenuity would also measure its temperatures and battery recharge performance.\nPerseverance rover is to deliver images from Ingenuity to Earth, reportedly a few hours after they were captured. NASA said the rover travelled a distance of 471 million km to reach the crater."}

The treatment of taxi drivers has been a disgrace and money that was meant for them has been held back by the [Scottish National Party] SNP to ransom them in this election.

As a technically advanced economy with global soft power the focus must be on the promotion of technological solutions, not energy austerity. We favour much more nuclear and in the UK and to use diplomacy to drive up energy efficiency in the USA and pressure Canada away from oil sands which are extremely polluting. The WTO [World Trade Organization] based order on tariffs predates the divergence in global environmental standards we are seeing. We oppose any phase out in fossil fuels for cars and will let technology lead us to carbon free fuels in due course[.]\n Why did you make the decision to also run for the in the Holyrood election?\n These elections are close in timing but different in nature. A4U is about maximising the pro-UK vote with a crisp consistent message that voters can follow. We aim to remove the SNP from government and audit Holyrood. George Galloway has taken a team approach and invited the skills needed for a true turnaround team. This is the first stage in encouraging other parties to work together by leaving them to contest constituencies. We have made tactical voting our number one strategy and it is now the main issue of the election. That achievement is extraordinary in such a short time when canvassing was impossible.\n What reason do voters have to give you their vote over a number of other pro-union parties?\n As above. Candidates were invited to form a team around a mission. Only A4U has sought to cooperate with legacy parties even when we disagree with them on many things, we are the only party in this election that is goal orientated. That's new and for the establishment it's terrifying.\n You left UKIP in 2015 over what you said was racism and bullying. What led you to the Scottish Unionists?\n Elements in UKIP attempted to adopt sectarianism as way to appeal for segments of the Unionist community. Growing up in where Catholic and Protestants live together happily this was to me. It reflected the divisive goals of the SNP and I have no patience with such cynical indulgent behaviour. I rejoined the Tories to further Brexit and left when they resorted to tribal blackmail over a second referendum to win a few seats. The Scottish Unionists are a British party that welcomes people of all religious traditions, always conscious of Britain's Christian heritage.\n What is a local issue that you think isn't being addressed that should be?\n is being failed as are so many district general hospitals where politicians want to centralise services and power to serve big cities where the votes are. Distance matters to emergency care. It's a matter of life and death. I've seen it when people take too long to get to A&amp;E because they don't have a car. For a young mum with children or an elderly couple, a round trip in a taxi of one hour is very expensive night out. Distance punishes those least mobile. It's obvious if you think about it.\n If you're elected, what's one thing you'd like to change about the law?\n I worked with my boss MEP [Member of the European Parliament] helping a Catholic family in Liverpool trying to save their child from having life support turned off. The hospital went as far as banning the child from being treated elsewhere and spent tens of thousands in court fees to this end. I saw a young doctor, , destroyed by a pernicious GMC [] who used members' fees to pursue her to destroy her. So I'm going to support both Alfie's Law and [Hadiza]'s Law:"}

According to his web site's 'civic vitae' section, Sturm was co-chair for the (Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party), District 62 in 2005 and a member of Veterans for Kerry.\nHe was a volunteer special deputy in , Minnesota, a member of the emergency helpline workgroup for the (MPD), the 9/11 and Remembrance Task Force with the and the racial equity fund with .\nAccording to Minneapolis' official website won the last election in 2017 receiving 44.69% of the vote in the final round of voting. reported Frey announced his run for re-election January 21. Sturm registered his candidacy on March 22.\nInterview with Philip Sturm.\n Please introduce yourself: your history and background.\n I'm Phil, 40 years old, married, white. Moved to Minneapolis in 2003 after being honorably discharged from the . Born in , TN [Tennessee] but grew up in the suburbs in , MN [Minnesota]. Graduated from in 1998. Went to for 2 years, but stopped going after the to go back to work. I work in chemicals and manufacturing. Solidly middle class now. I volunteered as a Special Deputy in 2018\u20132019 to learn more about public safety, emergency management and community service. I was privileged to serve on the MPD/911 workgroup which studied and recommended pilot programs for alternative responses other than police.\n What made you decide to run for Minneapolis Mayor?\n During the rioting in 2020, one night the mayor and were giving a press conference at 2 am. We watched online for two or three days as there was no government, no police and no safety. The governor is on the TV raving like a lunatic about Russian agents and . I knew then that we were at the mercy of highly credentialed yet fundamentally incompetent people. This experience solidified in my mind a need and a growing burden to do something about it. We have been lurching from crisis to crisis at the hands of so-called experts who consistently fail upwards. And I'm tired of it.\n Please elaborate on your military service.\n Joined in February of 1999. Went to boot camp in San Diego, CA [California]. Trained as Combat Engineer. Spent first year in . Was assigned to on , NC [North Carolina] (). Was on leave when 9/11 happened. We were assigned to the [Marine Expeditionary Unit] with . We captured Kandahar in Dec[ember] 2001, and began patrol and humanitarian operations in the area. Served under Gen[eral] . Did a lot of . \nWas in Jan[uary] 2003 as they were working up to invade Iraq. Was attached to as lead engineer element for RCT 1 () under Colonel Dowdy. Gen[eral] Mattis relieved Col Dowdy for going around Al Kut instead of through it. I would've been one of the first into the city and would've probably been killed or injured if we went that route. I was responsible for engineer assets, bridge capacities and neutralizing weapons caches, explosives and missiles, as we made our way north. I was sent back home soon after we reached Baghdad when everyone thought the war was over and everything was hunky dory. \n Why should Minneapolitans vote for you?\n People should vote for me if they want to try something other than the carousel of lawyers, professionals and MBAs that consistently produce substandard results, yet live in a world of awards, back patting, compliments and \"success\". We are all suffering for it. I'm an empirically minded person with experience in an industry which demands actual results and you can't fake it. I understand how to lead martial organizations and the values needed to reign in those cultures when they're out of control. I am ready and willing to make the necessary enemies, and am not concerned primarily with maintaining professional reputations, contacts and networks so I can get a nice cushy non-profit, consulting, or lobbying job somewhere after being mayor.\n Your civic says you resigned from the 9/11 and GWOT Remembrance Task Force [recently]. Why?\n I didn't want a political run to distract from the work of the Task Force or bring negative attention to it, and to avoid seeming like I was using it as a campaign point.\n Your web site says \"it is a falsehood that police just need good faith political allies to effect change [...] They [the Minneapolis police] do not view themselves as part of the community\". Could you please elaborate?\n We have listened to police chiefs, sheriffs, and unions now for years offer to \"sit down\" and work on reform \"together\". This is nothing but lies and stalling and media relations. They have no interest in sitting down with people who aren't cops and submitting to a reform process that isn't led by them. The ideology of the , the practice of , their all speak to an insular and autonomous culture operating in the grey zones of society. Part of the purpose of my campaign is to clarify where things stand, to say things that need saying, and to say those things other professional politicians can't say.\n Your web site also lists your promise to \"systematically dismantle the culture of militarism which is prevailing in police today\", adding \"[w]here there is militarism there is racism.\" Could you please elaborate?\n Given my experience in the Marine Corps, I was interested in our organizational history during the . I read a work by a social scientist who studied the effect of colonizing and occupying the global south on social trends in general. This work studied how the Marine Corps occupation of Haiti under exacerbated racism, produced new stereotypes, and increased chauvinist impulses in society. It elucidated the contradiction between trying to \"help\" other nations by militarily occupying them, while back at home racism against those people increases as a result of conflict. We see the same thing today in the aftermath of occupying Iraq and Afghanistan. We are there ostensibly to \"help\", but in our helping it foments and fosters a militaristic and xenophobic culture back home.\nMilitarism is appropriate in military settings. It is inappropriate outside of the military. Militarizing the police leads us to the same contradictions we see in global geopolitics: we are there ostensibly to \"help\" people in poor neighborhoods, but the occupying of those neighborhoods simply leads to an increasingly racist culture within the police force and the / cultures which support them.\n Your web site mentions a potential shift in tax burdens \"as necessary to address long standing economic disparities, as no cost is too great to achieve justice and equality.\" Could you please elaborate?\n By providing sales tax relief and other forms of tax relief to oppressed neighborhoods the tax levy burden would automatically shift by default to other areas of the city, with more money and wealth.\n On housing, you have voiced support on your web site for \"a tenant right to purchase, pay to quit notice and eviction protections, as well as rent stabilization.\" Could you please elaborate?\n I support a yearly based on inflation plus a set percentage (something around 5%). In light of the pandemic I support efforts to keep people in housing and making landlords whole under some sort of program afforded by federal relief.\n What does Minneapolis lack under Mayor Jacob Frey you hope to supplement?\n What I will bring is a more down to earth, empirically based, skeptical point of view to a self-reinforcing professional community that lacks insight into their blind spots, failures and limitations.\n Who did you support in the , if anyone?\n I supported .\n Who did you support in the , if anyone?\n I supported and voted for [Tim] Walz.\n Who did you support in the 2020 United States presidential election, if anyone?\n I supported Bernie Sanders and voted for [Joe] Biden.\n The reported in 2019 only 37% of low-income Minnesota students were proficient in maths and reading, and only 67% of African-American students graduated high school, compared to 88% of white students. How will you address this, if elected?\n The most effective thing we can do in concert with the school board is work on stable housing and food security. There is already work being done in this area between the city and the schools. Housing policies can more generally support low income and African American communities by reducing instability, uncertainty and the churn of changing schools and always moving and being shuffled around from lease to lease, which negatively impacts student learning and vitality.\n According to Data, the median black family in the has a median income of $38,178 a year, compared to the median white income of $84,459; Minnesota as a whole has the biggest income inequality of any state. How will you address this, if elected[?]\n We need to continue supporting living wage polices, enforcement of sick and leave time, and promote stable long term housing solutions which really give people a chance to get on top of bills and start saving some. We should pursue institutional cooperation with companies and educational organizations willing to sustain technical and trades education to support our manufacturing industries in the area (medical device, semi-conductor, plastics, prototyping, etc.)\n How will you handle the vaccine rollout, if elected?\n\"No answer was provided.\"\n Hennepin County has confirmed over 120,000 cases of COVID-19 and over 1,700 deaths since the beginning of the pandemic. How will you address this, if elected?\n\"No answer was provided.\"\n What distinguishes yourself from the other candidates?\n\"No answer was provided.\"\n If you could not vote for yourself, who would you vote for, if anyone?\n Undecided, but I generally support AJ Awed. \n What are some reasons people may not vote Sturm?\n Not enough government executive experience. Another white male running for office, etc.\n What do you picture Minneapolis looking like in 2025 under your leadership?\n\"No answer was provided.\"\n Which historical figure do you most admire?\n I am an avid history reader and it changes with whatever I'm currently reading and studying. Overall I would say that I admire as I strongly identify with his leadership style, personality, and example of calm, polite, level-headed executive style. I often identify with people who aren't immediately identified as leaders or successful, but when the shit hits the fan, they outperform their peers. It reflects my experience in the military as I wasn't recognized until I excelled under fire, and my occupational knowledge and competence helped me lead when others weren't expecting it. \nI look to as an example to counterbalance my cynicism, as he was the \"happy warrior\", and we could all be more positive in politics.\nA related quote that I like: \"This is a long tough road we have to travel. The men that can do things are going to be sought out just as surely as the sun rises in the morning. Fake reputations, habits of glib and clever speech, and glittering surface performance are going to be discovered.\" -\n Anything else you would like to say?\n\"No answer was provided.\""}

My name is Vitaly Filipchenko, I am an independent candidate for New York City mayor.\n What was it like growing up under and the ?\n So, really interesting. Like, basically, if you give a child a little bit more interest and a chance to be, how do I put it, in ; it's like you give a child the stock market. Giving that kind of information: what this mean, what this is, what this for? That time was like that.\n What made you decide to run for New York City mayor?\n I have [not seen] an honest mayor before, trying to see how [immigrants get] marginalised, because all this big money. Doesn't matter where you have it: from Democrats, from Republicans. They just followed that money. And all these big politician people? Its only interest: money, not real problem[s] from the people. They doesn't matter, Democrats, Republicans, they just making money. It's a money machine, for politician['s] gains.\n According to , you're the first Russian candidate for New York City mayor. Do you think that will help you among the immigrant population in the city?\n Not really, because people [are] so afraid. We didn't see the real democracy in New York. Everyone can speak up for democracy, but half of them [are] not registering to vote, half of them, they [do] not believe anymore in politicians \u2014 doesn't matter who you are \u2014 and a lot of people, just like, they don't care, you know? They can talk too much, but they['re] not doing anything.\n Why should New Yorkers vote for you?\n Because I'm a basic, basically like [the] whole history of, like, : I came from nothing, and became a self-[made] businessman, I became [a] hardworking person. And anyone from any kind of country, anyone from any kind of community, they can see [me] reflecting themself, themselves, because they're working really hard. I'm not standing behind any kind of big corporation, I'm not standing behind any kind of money. I'm just a regular guy. I want to be honest, I want to make a real democracy progress.\nLots of people, they just get tons of money, and they don't care. They not, really don't care. They don't have experience [with] what we have a problem in New York. I represent small business owners, I represent immigrants, I represent people who will struggle in this pandemic. Other candidates? They do not represent anyone. They just represent themselves. They are one per cent [of the] rich people. They never have problems, because rich people make more money on this problem. Other population[s], like office employee[s], who've been working in an office in a pandemic, who['re] still working from home, and making more than 100 thousand, and it's working at home! They just [do] not see [the] problem, what's exactly, what's going on right now. They just keep working!\nI represent essential business who are really working outside, who are really working with the streets, working with the people who are exactly doing the job for the people. Like, most of them, these employees, this is a high-level money, they['re] just still working from home, and still making [the] same amount [of] money. We, we [are] struggling, because we got big problem[s] with our business: a lot of business[es] get shut down, a lot of business[es] get closed like restaurants, deliveries. And a small business owners, it's like really struggling, and in New York, [the] Mayor has done nothing for this. It's also a horrible person.\n You've criticised to Sputnik News that \"if we look at other states, warm Florida, Georgia, their state budgets are not even ten times but 20, 50 times smaller than New York's. And their roads are better.\" Could you elaborate on that?\n Oh, it's simple. I'm [a] civil engineer. I got a[n] engineering degree for building roads: highway roads, and you can see how the difference [in the] state[s] of New York, Florida, Tennessee, Virginia, North Carolina. In Florida, they got a budget [of] USD4 billion, and the roads are so much better. In New York state, you got like [a] 190 billion budget in the state, and it got ten times worse, because I can see what they're doing right now. They just manipulate the budget.\nThey're doing one road, and [it's] suppose[d to be] if you do a good job, you can repair this road after ten years. But if you do repairs after like one or two years, they just budget, they're just like, obviously they're stealing money. If you're doing the same repair after two years, it's obviously \"oh you're stupid, you don't know what you're doing?\" They're just a regular: sit, then try to steal the money from the budget. It's called corruption.\nAnd I see all these roads, in New York, I'm not looking from just [the] perspective of like [a] simple idiot who doesn't know how to build the roads \u2014 I'm professional, I know how to build the roads \u2014 and I saw [in] 2019, on a Brooklyn expressway, there was building [of] two , it's like 500 feet, building completely new, for six months, and a did not match by like eight inches. They tried to connect to ramp to the main Brooklyn express; the level didn't match [by] like eight inches. They just demolish everything, and start building again from over.\nIt's like, \"Excuse me. You just spent [the] whole budget, and doing [it] again, what does this mean?\" It's like, you engineered, your was non-effectual, or what's wrong? And when I was spoke with other people, it's not only one example in New York. A lot of examples, a lot of\u2014because I'm living in Manhattan, I can see repairing the roads like [the] first time again. They did repair two years ago, and they just repair it again. It's like, \"Excuse me. Why [do] you waste a lot of money? And the quality with doing this repair, is, like, horrible!\"\nWe do have , , for eight years, and she's done [a] horrible job. Horrible. I'm a driver. I'm driving every day [in] like a regular car, like a truck. And I know..., , \u2014 Manhattan, Bronx, \u2014 all this road: horrible. Nothing just like repair; in [the] condition [of] who do[es] this job, I don't know who signs in contracts. Was this like a construction company, they do not have experience, or they're just like not qualif[ied] for this job.\nAnd more important: if you['re] Department of Transportation, you have to sign [an] agreement. If you're doing a bad job, you have to repair. Because, how are you going to get paid for [a] bad job? If you do a new job for interview[ing] me, and it's like probably, your boss gonna like \"oh, we're not going to pay you because it does nothing.\" Same thing. This person, Department of Transportation, Polly Trottenberg, they got moved up in Washington DC at a high position. It's like, that's a horrible job in New York, are you guys in DC completely idiots to hire this person, or something is corrupt. Same thing with the Mayor.\nAnd if you start pointing each one corner in New York, you will be surprised. Like, for example, all these candidates who are running like \"I have experience, I built so many \", they didn't do anything, you just negotiated with when you change the from like twenty-story building to forty-story building and asking \"give me ten, twenty apartments\" and they give you ten, twenty apartments for low-income because you're not building anything! For eight years in New York, low-income NYCHA [] didn't build nothing, it's still like negotiators with landlords.\nIn my position, I travel like New York City, we can build a lot of buildings, for high-quality luxury buildings, can sell it. And all this profit go back to New York budget. We say we can build, like NYCHA building, but actually residents can be like , they['re] allowed to decide where the budget has to go, not like, for example, New York City to decide \"well, we have to pay that whole buildings.\" I don't think they need any kind of painting, they have to just repair like [the] plumbing system, the electric system, and the people are in NYCHA who like co-op can decide it: \"okay, we need this first and then this second.\" And a lot of did not do many more after [the] 50s-60s.\nI want to build this Mitchell-Lama loan, same thing. We didn't have a clinic who wants New York City, because if you build new clinics, if you create a lot of construction job[s] to build, because the city was doing\u2014they just hired a little company with a high-quality payroll and have wasted money again! If you just hire New York City employers to create the New York City jobs, and start building, like, New York City clinics. You can hire a professional physician, all these doctors. It's when we create more jobs, and all these jobs are going to be get paid for New York. It's a simple way: stop wasting money for all these big billionaires; you just put a lot of infrastructure money to these billionaires! We can do that for citizens' sel[ves], to help oursel[ves]. That's my policy.\nJust like, I'm doing this from my view, because I'm living every day, one more day on the street, with these problems on the street. I understand what's going on. Most of New Yorkers just see something wrong, it's like \"oh, I don't know what's happened, I don't like it\". But they never focus what's the problem. What's exactly the base of the problem.\n Your web site has said \"I do not want to - but retrain.\" Could you please elaborate on that?\n Oh, simple way! You have information about, like, what's going on right now in New York. A lot of, it's called \", but if you be [specific], what does [it] mean, 'hate'? It mean[s], hate Asian; it's mean[t] for the basic information. What they say 'hate crime', it mean[s] Asian people hate Asian people, but it's not. Right now in New York City, most of 90 per cent [of] black people are completely destroying Asian people, and it's mean[ing] it's not 'hate crime', it's actually a \"racist\" crime. I have to be specific, and I have to call [a] specific name [for] what's going on, and they try to cover this and for this to know it's just 'hate crime'.\nNot possible, 'hate crime'. It's a completely racist crime! Because most of them, who [are] doing this act, it was like a different ethnicity [of] people. It's a, obviously, race crime. And to find out with this problem, you have to put more officers to work, [it] means you have to pay overtime, and to pay more officers, for example, if you go every day and there's, say, like ten thousand officer[s], you have to put in fifteen thousand, because you have to be undercover, you have to be [taking] more shift[s], you have to be [spending] more time on the job to stop this crime.\nIf you want to defund police, how are you going to stop the crime? It's like : we want to defund police, but we need more security on the streets. That doesn't work. And I say it's like \"no, it's not defund police, you have to retrain.\" Because in my opinion, [a] bad person has to be in a bad place; a good person has to be in a good place. It doesn't matter if police officer, or just regular citizen. If you do something wrong, you deserve to be in the wrong place. Same thing with police! If you're not deserv[ing] to be a good officer, excuse me, we have to fire you. I have to get trained-better police officers; it's better quality.\n[In] most of [the] states, for example Vermont, Virginia, Georgia, North Carolina, District [of] Columbia, a police officer has to pass [a] physical exam every six months. For example, you have to run in 1.7 miles on the time. If you look at the New York police officer? Obviously, after three years, in [officers], I can see half of them cannot run. It means they [are] not physically trained for this job. And if you can see, I'm not gonna blame. I want to say the systems are really bad. And if you try to stop any kind of crime, you have to be physically prepared. And what [do] police officers do? They start shooting. Because they're afraid! They're not physically prepared for any kind of physical violation. They cannot prepare any kind of physical fight: , boxing, , because they don't have experience.\nIf a person [is] really sick, what's he gonna do, if they have a power? Just going to shoot you. Simple answers. And I saw a lot of New York police: overweight, and not ready for any kind of physical activity. That's a big problem. New York State, they['re] screaming \"we Democrats, we['re] for democracy\", not actually, not guys. You['re] just hypocrites. They try to blame everyone except themselves.\n How do you plan to, in your words, \"support small businesses with rent law changes\"?\n Oh, I told everybody. When it was a[n] epidemic\u2014COVID-19 problems, I told everybody [a] simple way, because I was trying to volunteer [for] : it's a food distribution from the city from volunteers, from donors who, like, small business owners that needed the food. Now obviously food bank[s]: not bad, not bad, but again, it's a canned food, not a lot of good food. And, in my opinion, back in the time, [the] city can make a contract with all small business restaurants. Together, for example, for one period [of] time, from like 8am to 10pm, [the] city will pay money for, like, breakfast or lunchtime for homeless people, who lost a job or [have] low-income. People can get [a] normal meal, and in [the] late time, all these restaurant[s] can [be] working like regular restaurants, and you can make your profit and money.\nBecause you can see a lot of businesses were shut down, because they can't survive. In my opinion, it's completely mismanagement with small businesses. We just can sign the contract. First of all, we can help these people who really struggle with food; they can get a good-quality food. It's like what all deserves.\n How do you plan to, in your words, \"Build back a greener, fairer city\"?\n First of all, you should notice [the] city's like a cement jungle: a lot of , a lot of cement. And again, if you notice, we do a lot of bus lane and bike lane, and a lot of people know it's really toxic paint. When you do this painting, you can make it worse for [the] environment. And most important, when you're planning bike lanes, bus lanes not correctly, you create your traffic contractions. When you create your traffic contractions, what's happening? A lot of coming from the cars, a lot is and it's going to be worse.\nPeople say like \"oh, we got the bikes, that's safe\". No, because we still have stores, we still have deliveries, we still have truck[s that] have to deliver with food, have to deliver it [with] any kind of supplies, material, but where's he going to park? That's no way to find the parking. That's really [going to] have to , triple park, and blocking in the street, and it cause[s] congestion. And the people still like to stop because they have to deliver, they have to support small business. But city can't violation, one, second, well, it's a big traffic, sort of with conjunction with oxycarbonite. This means there was planning completely not, how would [I] say in really nice way...completely stupid.\nBecause I see all this planning was like, they created, okay, for example, if you notice a lot of parking spots for trucks, for cars, for deliveries, it was [a] parking zone. But, because restaurant[s were] struggling, they put in extra seats from the parking spots. It means they took all the parking spots for cars, but the cars have to deliver the food, and they have to plan, where they have to park? Nowhere. It's deteriorated worse and worse, this was planning completely stupid. If you plan in [a] correct way it deserves, like different countries Norway, like British, you can see exactly how the location [of] the parking spot. How [it's] allocated all this green zone.\nIf you put in a lot of bushes, if you plant in a lot of green trees, and then you make it a better environment. If you create it like [a] sidewalk over the road, nothing across the road like a lot of China, Korea and Japan, they created over the road. It's like small parks, each one is like [a] tiny park with the trees, with benches, and it's [safe]! People can cross over the road, and they have to cross the road, they go over the path, there's a small\u2014tiny parks, it's a great idea [that] already exists in China, and in different countries.\nAnd I was planning the same thing to create in New York City but again, all these candidates [are] screaming \"I'm going to put in four billion dollars on the parks\", \"I'm going to put ten billion over that\", guys. You just drop the name and numbers. You never offered any kind of specific job. Like for example, I live in New York City, Manhattan, where you have . And now Mayor put it in the budget 1.2 billion dollars to renovating the park. But [the] park is functional. It exists, and I'm running every Sunday there. It's working really good, but you want to do the repair, idiot. There really exists this park, you have to create a different one which does not exist and will, like for example Bronx, Queens, they need more parks for people. Why focus all big money for little Manhattan?\nAnd to figure out exactly where is the problem, where the problem is actually that we have the big . Then you have to create a park in that area. Over here, what they're doing is just try to create it, like, new park, and new park is bad, and they see like all this rail and space to high landlords, therefore the price skyrocket[s]. Because he got a better park, he got more trains. Same with Andrew Cuomo. He tried to create a more normal train station. We already have enough train stations. Like family, four years ago they built four extra stuff for , they spent four billion dollars. For four billion dollars, you can buy with the 20 thousand apartments for [the] same price. 20 thousand apartment[s], you can put all these people who [need] a low-income property. To pay it all, it's a lot of apartments.\nAnd I see all this planning, what's going on in New York, it's just like it's a waste of money. They['re] pretending we need to build train station, of course we do, but we've have to look with the needs first.\n Why have you decided to run as an independent candidate?\n Because the problem is that Democrats and Republicans: they just, most of them, they say they're for people. But actually they're not for people, they're just for money. Because if you['re] like, for example, , for example. \"I want to help the people\". Dude, you already got your business, you're getting millions dollars, you already spent like a hundred million dollars when you're in the United States, now you're running for mayor. Dude, you already got power, you got business, you can help them as anyone else.\nI don't have a power, I just to be like speak out from the people who really deserves the help. Because I'm living in this problem, and as you guys are not living the problem! Because they're just looking above us, because they have [a] different style [of] life, they own the apartments, they own the houses, they got assets of millions of dollars. I'm just a regular guy! I can speak up for everybody. That's my main form because I try to help people, because I know the problem. I'm living the shoot with these people.\n What has [current mayor] Bill de Blasio not done that you would like to do instead?\n Oh first of all, he completely screwed the city. If you remember back with COVID-19 became; he said like \"okay, guys, I give you free bus rides\" instead [of] say[ing] like \"no, no bus rides, no any kind of train\", and if I was the mayor I can say \"you know, people, you can use the bikes, like whatever for free, Citi pay [to use], if you guys drive in the car, you have to work\", like for example I was talking [to] a lot of nurses and doctors. Do you know how many they got through because they have to work, they can't find the parking spot and again paying a lot of money.\nAs for me, if you drive a new car, you got a big distance from anybody else. It's [the virus] is not spreading out. But back in the time, de Blasio said like \"okay guys, everyone in the [Metropolitan Transportation Authority] is essential business\". But bacteria don't care [about] essentially; you're not essential, you just spread disease. And instead he said like \"all these busses [are] free in New York.\" Really, and all that mentality for people, free bus can get more riders in the bus, and he obviously just spread[s] more and more COVID-19. That's a big problem.\nAnd if you want to do essential business, okay, I understand! Some people [don't] have a car, some people\u2014like for example, do you know many nurses live in , they have to drive their car? A lot, a lot! And if you try to create, you have to do, for example, like China, Korea or Russia. What['ve] they done? They created more jobs, they put a person who was working on a station to check your temperature, and if you see the high fevers like, if you necessarily have to go back home, you cannot spread the fever. That's how they created the job, and that is how they stop the spread.\nBecause I remember back, I would always wake up six in the morning, I walk in flat six stor[ies], and I see [it] packed: whole train, whole bus, was packed. Even right now, even two months, five months, six months, because I wake up, I'm working to go work by the train, by the bus. And I see it's completely packed.\nIf you want to do a better job, you can send to people who can do like, you know, like cashiers, or like managers of like , like excuse me guys, in this wagon: 20 people, next wagon please, 20 people. To get the distance. Back in the time, why this was so horrible, COVID-19 struck in New York with people spreading through the empty [space] in their busses because nobody came [at] a distance. That was bad, bad, horrible, it was [a] bad job for a mayor, and bad job for Governor Cuomo. Both of them did a horrible job.\n Who did you support in the 2017 New York City mayoral election, if anyone?\nBecause you know, some people, they pretend, it won't help. But when you get more information\u2014because most of them, you can see information [for] any kind of candidate because they got more money, so they can post themselves but from better sides. But like for example, like immigrants like me, they get marginalised. Because why do I have to put \"simple guy\" to be a mayor? Because [the] one per cent in New York City, they never get to problem, because rich people want to say in New York, they feel good. All these guys who is represent[ing] New Yorkers, they [are] the one per cent. You got [a] high-payroll job, got tons of money. Guys, you don't know the problem, how do you know it helps the poor person, if you never live in his shoes?\nThat's a big problem. Because I came here in this country. Tourist visa. Overstayed, not legal. [I] was afraid to get kicked out by [Immigration and Customs Enforcement]. Then I , and [got] s, then I got , then I got my company. I run [a] moving business for ten years. Every day working hard, every day on the street I know what's going on, what kind of problem.\nThis was my main idea because I know the problems. I'm not conceived from any kind of paper, or statistic, or anywhere in [a] computer. No, I really live this problem. Other guys? They try to pretend to be living the problem. But you never know the problem. How do you [be] like a person who's struggling for food, trying to listen for . Since right now, same thing. \n Who did you support in the , so, the one for governor, basically?\n Who did you support in the 2020 presidential election, if anyone?\n You lived in Russia, so, who did you support in the , if anyone, if you want to say?\n Well yes, but did you support anyone, any one candidate?\n New York City has been notorious for being one of the heaviest-affected cities at the start of the pandemic, and still the city has over 930 thousand total reported cases of COVID-19 [and] over [32] thousand deaths. How will you address this, if elected?\nBecause I spoke [to] a lot of Russian doctors, American doctors, skilled professionals; because if you do any kind of procedure, you have to put it in mask. You go to your patient, you write it down: information, you check this person, then you get out from the room. You take it (mask) off, and throw [it] away because [it's] already hazard material. You cannot go, with this mask, in a different room.\nAnd back in the time, they didn't give you full information: how to operate it, what they have to do; because a lot of people [don't] know to put it, gloves, how taking off this gloves. Because when I was an auxiliary, I was training for CPI, and they explained how to use the mask, how [to] use the , how taking off this gloves. But this high-quality position person got access for TV, never [gave] you free classes [to] explain how this work[s], how to use your mask because I will see on the street people holding the cell phone, , put it in the\u2014second, , put it in the pocket, and still using gloves. Guys, you cannot touch this stuff in the gloves and put it in the pocket because when you're coming back home, you pull it out [of] your wallet without gloves, and all this bacteria going to spread it out.\nAnother big problem: most of the foreign countries, they did sanitise the street. They did [it] using, like, light, they've been using special spray[s] on the street because when you walk, where usually goes the virus? It's on the ground. And you step in your shoe, whatever you got the mask, whatever you got any kind of gloves, you're going to bring them home in your shoes. But other countries, they're doing better because they did the stret. New York City [has] done nothing because they['re] like \"oh, we want to put more money over there, over there\", but it didn't do exactly the job what it needs.\nEven they started disinfecting [the] MT[A] after six, seven months later, is it like, ridiculously stupid? \n How will you help racial and ethnic minorities, if elected?\nFor my opinion, I would like to create a lot of extra classes: re-qualification, because if you created more s, for example, [in the] community, we have to grow a lot of trees and bushes and small to get organic food, to teach the kids. Because I grew up in Russia, everybody knows because everybody [has] a when we grow, like, all these vegetables or just fruits, and we learned how to do this. American kids [don't] know because they don't have a lot of programmes, and if you created everything back to community, to school, to give them gardens, to colleges, to any kind [of] big\u2014for example, like... \nAnd you can't see it, you got a big square roof, and you can plant the garden over there. Any kind of building can create a small garden with that. You can create it, more oxygen with all this green, because it's a simple, it's a biological process. You have to put [in] more green, and if you create it to start back to community, that will be co-operation. You can help all these people who really struggle: any kind of minority, any who's struggling for new job, we can [create] the job. Stop giving away money in jobs for big corporations; [they] already have enough money.\nYou have to focus on ethnicity, on the people who lost [their] job. Don't forget: New York City still [has] . Try to get a job: if you're wrong, you can get a job! If you['re] getting over 50, no way! That's a big problem. It doesn't matter who you are: Russian, Asian, from Africa; if you're over 50, [it's] really difficult. And if you['re] an immigrant, no, harder, because we['ve] got [a] . And then, they['re] looking at nothing but like \"oh, you can't speak English.\" Yes we can, but we got accents.\" Doesn't matter.\nWe saw people coming from different countries, got two or three education[s], two or three colleges. But you know, in America, if you['re] someone [that's] got [an] accent, already it's like \"foreigner.\" I know some people who told me on the street \"go back to your country.\" Doesn't matter, but I'm still here because I love this country. \n Data collected by CBS News finds homeless New Yorkers are two to three times more likely to die from COVID-19 than the general population, and homeless students graduate at a sixteen per cent lower rate. 88 per cent of individuals facing homelessness in New York City are black or . How will you address the homelessness crisis, if elected?\nWe have to participate each one person who loves their job, retrain and give one more chance to get a new job. That's why my plan to build new houses using people for the city, that's when I created [for the] city: more jobs. Because you're going to get more salary, you're going [to] get more insurance and they get medicine. That's when I'm planning to build medical buildings and, as they build on by city, it's like if you created more jobs, all these people from the homeless, they can get retrained.\nMost important for me: all these college students who [are] in New York, people try to\u2014\"oh, I'm going to give you for free college tuition, blah blah blah\", even Biden said that, but we have zero. For me, honestly, I'm not going [to] promise any kind [of] free college but, I got a guarantee: if you go to , you're going to guarantee to have a job in New York City because [the] city gonna create a lot of jobs, and [it's] gonna be enough for everyone.\nIt's like with : [he] created more jobs with more money, exactly in all the cit[ies] in all the state[s], not only for people who gives this opportunity to live [a] good life, not for big corporation[s], because big corporation[s] already got enough money, why [do] they have to sign this big corporation contract if I keep creating a lot of small jobs? Focus on the people, not on the big money. \n How will you handle the rollout?\nBecause right now, people, most of people [don't] have education and they're thinking like \"vaccine is so stupid\", but if you created some kind of classes. And again, if you created classes, you created the job: who is going to be training on these classes, who gives this\u2014provides this information for community. I mean, we already solved two problems: we created more jobs to give better education for communities.\nBecause right now, people, they don't care: \"oh, government always gonna lie to us.\" And if you created this information in classes, people can believe it, what's going on. And you have to give some kind of example, not just say \"we have to be vaccinated.\" If you show how it's work, what is the problem and how does it solve this problem. It's when you give information, and the people will decide better because they got better information. Right now, we don't have any kind of information. Why [do] they have to get this information from the governments who don't care about me? They just offered me to put it, vaccine, but didn't explain in [a] simple way for simple people. \n If you couldn't vote for yourself, who would you vote for?\nThat's more important for me. If you're looking back like President, he was starting from an axe-man, the chuck in the woods, then he became like postmaster, delivering the mail for [the] community, and he would talk to each one person when delivering the mail.\nYou have, you know, like most of these candidates, they just doing; promote themselves. They're not really believe in our needs for people who [are] really struggling. Because I represent like immigrants, I'm represent[ing] small business owners, I'm represent[ing] like part of police, I'm represent[ing] part of MTA because I've been in one's infrastructure, and it's always a problem. Because I have overview in which one solution. And other candidate[s], to be honest, they['re] dropping the cool name or any kind of programme: \"you can see with my web site one hop and step for each one day what I'm gonna do.\" Excuse me, I want to hear you right now, simple explanation.\nBecause people want to know how. And when. Because I want to see the numbers. Because I want to know exactly how it's work, because I'm a simple guy, I'm not going to be playing like someone cannot calculate it, because I'm [an] engineer, I know how to calculate, how [to] measure it, how created this stuff. That's what was studied in college. \n What are some reasons people might not vote for you?\nIn the basic democracy, everybody get[s] the same chance to speak up, explain what they're doing, have opportunities to be on the ballot. And these arrogant Democrats, it's like \"already [chose] one, I don't want to vote for you.\" You're not voting for new\u2014simple explanation. You don't know the rules. You're ready not to represent democracy, democracy exactly are opposite. You have to give the chance for everybody, you have to help everyone, that's how it works because democracy, when you get a process discussion, when you get across in a debate, it's coming [up with] a real, true solution. That's how democracies work.\nThat's always really surprising New York. A lot of people? \"I don't know, I love this guy, I love this guy.\" Excuse me! If you want to get real democracy, you have to give chance[s] for everybody, when they coming time to debate, discuss, you can figure out who is better. Because if someone got money, okay, what is about money? Everybody who's [a] successful businessman I'm going to ask a simple question: \"are your employee[s] union[ised] or not?\" That's it! Because big corporations never want to have the union guys, because union guys can be protected by government. That's my answer.\nObviously, all this who's running, they don't care, they just care [about] themself. And if you see how [many] contributions they have I suggest it's lying, you know what contributions: you have to match one to eight? And all these candidates got like one million, got contribution from city five million, another one got like half million, got contribution three million. Guys, you still have money, who need[s] it?\nBecause all this money for taxpayers who really suffer right now, who need a day, who loves the job, who cannot pay rent, you guys promised to help it and then taking this money from mentioned five, ten contributions and spend it for advertising millions? I think it's hypocrisy. Who try to promise our poor people, and spend money for advertising. Is it hypocrisy? \n Which person from history do you identi-\n Anything else you would like to say, then?\nBecause other people, other candidates, they just buy people who collect the signature. I'm not buying, because I don't have any money, I'm not behind any kind of big corporation, I just do it by myself. If someone's interested and believe me, they can contact me on my web site, through my e-mail, office @ vitalyformayor.com, and please, if you can help, we can win. We can prove it: immigrants can get job done! "}

Gray won the seat with 45.1% of the vote at the , winning 13.1% more than the second placed candidate Helen McFarlane of the Scottish Labour party, who received 32.0% of the votes.\nOne of the eight candidates running in this constituency is Neil Manson, the Scottish regional chair of the (SDP). The SDP website claims Manson has \"enjoyed a varied career working across international markets in both the manufacturing industry and energy sector\", and Manson joined the SDP in 2019 after reading the party's New Declaration, which outlines the party's principles.\n\"Wikinews\" spoke to Manson about important issues facing Airdrie and Shotts in this by-election.\nInterview.\n Why did you decide to run in this by-election?\n The SDP are seeing a genuine resurgence across the UK, as more and more people become disillusioned with current party politics and look for an alternative party with honest policies at its heart based on our families and communities - no more so than in Scotland. As the Regional Chairman for Scotland I'm a strong advocate for the SDP and also a local, having moved here over 20 years ago and brought up my family in Airdrie.\n What are your thoughts on how the coronavirus pandemic has been handled by Westminster?\n To be honest it's been a difficult task to lead the country through the pandemic, and I don't think there's any doubt mistakes have been made by both the Westminster and Holyrood Governments but being overly critical doesn't help. We as a party supported the , but since then have been sceptical of the ongoing Stop-Go approach which didn't suppress the virus and has only served to undermine peoples liberties, and risked causing a prolonged economic depression and negative impact on society.\n What do you think needs to be done to improve transport services in the Airdrie and Shotts constituency?\n Our primary policy pledge for transport is to nationalise the rail system, and in the first instance to assert greater control over bus services, particularly an increase in funding support for regional and rural bus travel.\n Do you support the idea of a ?\n No. The constitution is a reserved matter and the UK Parliament agreed to a referendum which resulted in the decision of the Scottish people to remain in the the United Kingdom. Any change would need to first be discussed and agreed at Westminster.\n Do you think the Conservative government is doing enough to combat climate change?\n Environmental issues suffer from too much talk and not enough action under the current (and previous) governments. Whilst the SDP will honour and comply with our global environmental obligations, we would look to implement sustainable changes by encouraging behavioral changes within industry and society as a whole.\n The SNP describes themselves as social democratic. Where are some primary areas of difference between your party and theirs?\n Firstly, we'd disagree that the SNP are social democrats, they're populists. The SDP are actually social democrats in our every day thinking, beliefs and policies - and not just at election time. We're also patriotic, and believe in a strong Scotland within a strong United Kingdom for the benefit of all its citizens.\n Do you agree with your party's policy that an should be established?\n Yes, I believe this policy can assist in healing many of the divisions we see across the UK, ending the perception of the UK Parliament as an English parliament with Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland under its rule. This multi-tiered approach dissolves accountability, fosters a culture of apathy and creates a vacuum where parties like the SNP thrive.\n What does mean to you?\n The SDP seeks the common good in Britain's national interest. We represent neither capital nor labour, not private industry nor the public sector, but only the welfare of the British people and residents of these islands. We seek a path where all the constituent elements of our society can grow and prosper. We believe in a Social Market Economy where pro-public sector and pro-market policy can beneficially coexist within a balanced programme \u2013 provided each inhabits its correct domain, and neither is allowed to distort our country's economy in the service of ideology.\n What is a local issue that you think isn't being addressed that should be?\n I have concerns over the long term plans for our sports and leisure facilities in our local towns and communities throughout the constituency. Many are potentially at risk due to continuing Scottish Government funding cuts to council budgets and access for people of all ages to these facilities to improve our physical and mental health is vital, even more so now to ensure our recovery from Covid[-19].\n If you're elected, what's one thing you'd like to change about the law?\n I'd support the repeal of the much-maligned SNP Hate Crime and Public Order Act, which threatens to criminalise speech on a range of issues if it is thought to be 'hateful'. We feel the bill is ambiguous and lacks sufficient safeguards, even after a recent campaign found that 87 per cent of Scots hold free speech to be an 'important right'. The Hate Crime Bill also raises issues over the erosion of sex-based rights. Within the SDP Transgender and Biological Sex-based Rights policy, we state that it is our belief that biological sex is real, and pledge to support the use of plain English for discussions of biological sex in health and reproductive care."}

Incumbent mayor , who won the with 59% of the vote, is eligible for a fifth term but announced on May 6 he would retire.\nInterview with Arthur Kostendt.\n Please introduce yourself: your history and your background.\n I grew up, one of four children, in [Ohio], an outer ring suburb of Cleveland (to the North) and (to the South). I was a student-athlete (Tennis) and musician (Saxophone). I went to college at the University of Notre Dame, in [Indiana], where I studied Finance. I joined the Army Reserve Officer Training Corps halfway through college, and received my diploma and officer's commission on the same day in May, 2013. I attended the 's basic course in [,] and then began my banking career in Cleveland, in January of 2014, at B&amp;F Capital Markets.

I received my passing bar exam results on April 20th, 2021 and I am now licensed to deal blackjack, which I plan to do part time at night while growing my solo law practice based in downtown Cleveland.\n What made you decide to run for Mayor of Cleveland?\n I love my home, the city of Cleveland, and I believe it is a great place with amazing Neighbors. In the future, I believe Cleveland will be recognized as the best place to live in the United States. However, living here today, we are confronted with the reality that our city government suffers from poor leadership. The consequences are severe: rampant crime, litter and blight, poorly maintained streets, ineffective schools, and waste are just a few of the ways our Neighbors suffer from poor government leadership[.] Rather than just complain about it, I decided to run for mayor with a goal of improving leadership in city government and provision of city services to our people.\n What are some of the reasons Clevelanders should vote for you?\n I am a leader, not a politician, and a true change candidate. I am committed to service above self, and I am not looking to use the office of mayor as a stepping stone to greater power or more money. I will finally hold municipal departments accountable for effectively serving the city.\n Please elaborate on your service in the US military.\n I joined the Army ROTC after my second year at the University of Notre Dame, and earned a commission from the President on the day I graduated in 2013.

Attached to North Carolina's , the \"Steel Panther\" Battalion served in Kuwait, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE from Autumn 2019 to Autumn 2020. After returning home, I joined the Battalion operations team and I am in the process of transitioning to the Ohio Army National Guard Judge Advocate General's Corps.\nI have been awarded the , the Army , the , the , the , the , the , the with M Device, and a [.]\n Your web site promises \"service above self.\" What does that mean for you?\n In 10:42-44, instructs his : \"You know that those who are considered rulers over the s lord it over them, and their great ones exercise authority over them. Yet it shall not be so among you; but whoever desires to become great among you shall be your servant. And whoever of you desires to be first shall be slave of all.\" The good leader, as I have witnessed in the military, is a servant of the mission and the team. He does not lord his position over his charges but instead seeks to assume their burdens to whatever extent is possible and prudent.\n What are some of the things you would do as Cleveland Mayor?\n Reform and empower the Division of Police to protect our Neighbors; demand adequacy and discipline in our public schoolhouses; take the initiative to clean up litter, graffiti, and abandoned structures; and hold personnel in city departments accountable to Clevelanders for competent service.\n You mention disciplining government and cutting waste. Could you please elaborate?\n [Kostendt had provided a link along with this answer, which is mentioned in the External links section.]\nMs. [Rachel] Dissell's reporting sheds light on undisciplined conduct in our city government, in this case the health department. The Editor's Note further demonstrates lack of accountability and transparency in our city government.\nDepartments of the Cleveland city government struggle to respond to [Freedom of Information Act] requests from media in a timely manner, struggle to organize efficient street clearing in winter, struggle to facilitate/approve much-needed community togetherness events proposed by motivated Neighbors, etc. I would change this. In terms of waste, the Mayor has 27 executive or special assistants according to the 2019 budget, one of whom is now facing rape charges. I believe I could do more with less.\n In one of your essays on your web site, this one titled 'Urban Blight', you wrote \"[r]ehabilitating the lands of our city, including destruction of abandoned and neglected properties [...] starts with doing the work to get it cleaned up\". Could you please elaborate?\n Cutting grass, removing debris, and deconstructing a home is work that anybody could do, given time and instruction on safe procedure. \"Building\" a home is work that layman volunteers often do, such as with . The city should take the lead on finding people motivated to do the work, finding a contractor willing to provide them the instruction, and executing. Blighted structures are not only an eyesore, but costly in terms of property value and taxes, and dangerous havens for criminal activity.\n In one of your essays on your web site, this one titled [\"]The In-Crowd of Cleveland 'Politics'\", you wrote \"when you vote, you can vote somebody in the in-crowd, or you can vote for me.\" Could you please elaborate on your thoughts regarding Cleveland's \"in-crowd\"?\n\"No answer was provided.\"\n You wrote in your essay \"Climate Change\": \"climate change is of no consequence to our city, and I consider it an enormous distraction and waste of potentially productive time.\" Could you please elaborate?\n The climate in Cleveland is awful -- high of 51 [] today on May 11th. In this day and age, people are largely free to choose what climate they live and work in, and they largely choose climates that are warmer. Cleveland's low average temperatures are a significant hindrance to our growth and prosperity. Change would be a great thing, potentially leading to shorter and milder winters. At the extremes, extreme heat is less deadly and less destructive than our extreme cold. I spent June and July in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, where temperatures linger above 100 [] in the midnight darkness, and human life is doing just fine there. Cleveland is in no danger of getting that hot. The benefits of warmer temperatures, less snow, and less ice dramatically outweigh the supposed risks to our city of extreme heat or tornadic/hurricane activity that are associated with climate change. Larger population centers that have been preying on Cleveland's population for decades are in much greater danger from the effects of warmer temperatures and rising sea levels, so climate change would be very likely to reverse those trends and improve the fortunes of our own city (admittedly at the tragic expense of other American communities).\n What does Cleveland lack under Mayor Frank Johnson you hope to supplement?\n Energetic leadership of the municipal staff, and a culture of accountability that guides all city departments.\n Who did you support in the 2017 Cleveland mayoral election, if anyone?\n Mayor Frank Jackson, reluctantly[.]\n Who did you support in the , if anyone?\n Governor Mike DeWine (who it may be worth noting is my commander-in-chief) and Lt. [Lieutenant] Governor [.]\n Who did you support in the 2020 United States presidential election, if anyone?\n Mr. and Ms. Michelle Tidball[.]\n Cleveland was ranked in 2019 by the US Census Bureau worst in child poverty, second-worst for working-age adults and third in older-adult poverty among the largest US cities. How will you address this, if elected?\n By investing in our Neighbors, our children, and our future, we can drive a positive feedback loop of investment and productivity in our neighborhoods. Cleveland is shrinking, and so is our customer base and our tax base. By securing the streets from crime, improving schools to make Cleveland an attractive place to raise a family, cleaning up our shared spaces, and fixing lackluster provision of city services, City Hall can reverse population decline and make Cleveland an attractive place to invest in businesses, property, workers, and a bright economic future. Education and future-oriented investment are the \"leading indicators\" of economic self-sufficiency.\n Cuyahoga County, which Cleveland is in, has recorded over 110,000 cases of COVID-19 and over 2,100 deaths since the beginning of the pandemic. How will you address this, if elected?\n Clevelanders can best fight the effects of disease, and other more common deadly health conditions, by prioritizing healthy eating, abstinence from substance abuse, and consistent physical fitness.\n How will you help racial and ethnic minorities, if elected?\n Racial and ethnic minorities make up a majority of our Neighbors, so they are the ones who have suffered the most from ineffective leadership and poor provision of city services. I will help racial and ethnic minorities, and every one of our Neighbors, by providing them what the city government owes its people: safe streets in every neighborhood at any time of day, effective schools, a clean and safe environment, and a disciplined city administration.\n If you could not vote for yourself, who would you vote for, if anyone?\n I am really impressed with many of the candidates that have participated with me in discussions thus far. My answer at this point is probably Justin Bibb with honorable mentions to Landry Simmons, Zack Reed, and Ross DiBello in no particular order.\n What are some reasons people may not vote O'Kostendt?\n I will face a learning curve when it comes to working in city government, as I have never done so before. It will take time for me to learn the nuts and bolts, and become fully effective.\n How will you manage the rollout, if elected?\n Some reports indicate that virtually all adults who want the vaccine have received it, including yours truly. The Ohio Army National Guard in association with CSU [Cleveland State University] and other providers did a commendable job in organizing vaccine distribution.\n Imagine Cleveland in 2025 under an O'Kostendt leadership. What do you picture it looking like?\n\"No answer was provided.\"\n Which historical figure do you most admire?\n Jesus Christ of [.]\n Anything else you would like to say?\n Thanks for your interest in my campaign, [...], and sorry for the extended wait on my response."}

Should it do so, Netanyahu's twelve-year tenure of fifteen years total as Israel's longest-serving prime minister would end, being replaced by head of right-wing party Naftali Bennett, a staunch advocate for the controversial Israeli settlement in the West Bank and opponent of an independent state of Palestine.\nUnder the rotation agreement agreed by the eight parties, Bennett will serve as prime minister for the first two years of a four-year term, and Lapid foreign minister, according to CNN.

It shares the \"liberal\" with Australia's governing Liberal Party, who called the New Liberals a \"cynical attempt to piggyback\" on their own name, even presenting a survey from Crosby Textor of over 2000 voters that claimed over two-thirds of voters could percieve a connection between the parties, in an attempt to prevent the party's registration. Ultimately, the decided that, on balance, the name of the New Liberals was \"sufficiently visually and aurally distinct\" from the Liberal Party's name, and registered the party.\n\"Wikinews\" spoke with the New Liberals' party leader Victor Kline via email about the plans of the New Liberals and their policies and values.\nInterview.\n One of your party's key slogans, as seen on your website, is that you're economically responsible and socially progressive. Could you explain to me more of what this means?\n Economically responsible means that we look to what economics can achieve for society unlike many who see economics as some sort of God which must be served. So our economics will be used to get the three million people who live below the poverty line above that line and in the process of getting them into employment, stimulate small and large business alike. Socially progressive is really the other side of the same coin, in that we want to achieve a just, balanced society where everyone has equality of opportunity and a strong purpose. And you can see that that social progressiveness is underwritten by our economic responsibility[.]\n Why is it that your party decided to call yourselves the New Liberals, given there's already a Liberal Party?\n The current Liberal Party of Australia has abandoned all and is actually an ultra- party. Indeed we are suing them through the for misrepresentation and fraud by continuing to use the word 'liberal' in their name, and if we are successful, they will be deregistered as a political party. We are a real liberal party as that is understood around the world and has been for two hundred years, to mean a party which believes in equality of opportunity, compassion and justice, plus freedom of the individual but with a strong place for government to ensure that in exercising that freedom, the individual doesn't impinge on the freedom of others.\n Lately, the issue of a family in immigration detention has been a topic of debate. The has been held in immigration detention for 2018 after their request for protection was rejected, after 5 years of living in the Queensland town of . They've now been reunited in Perth, where four year old Tharnicaa is being treated after a serious blood infection. What are your thoughts on this case, and on immigration law more broadly?\n We believe that the treatment of refugees and asylum seekers over the last 30 years has been nothing short of a national shame, which will be looked back on with the same sort of horror people have when they look back on slavery. We intend to totally reform the system including, first and foremost, the abolition of mandatory detention of asylum seekers.\n Why did you decide to join the New Liberals?\n I was actually one of the four founders of the New Liberals. The party was founded because we felt that the major parties had both moved so far to the right that there was no-one to represent the majority of the people, and that our civil liberties were under such threat that our democracy was at risk of imploding into an authoritarian regime.\n According to your website, your party has so far chosen 17 candidates for the next federal election. How did you come to select them?\n We actually have quite a few more candidates but who are yet to go on the website. We were looking for people who were smart, and with a strong moral compass, and who have real world experience unlike 80% of the current political class who have not worked outside of politics or the unions.\n What do you think about how the federal government has handled the COVID-19 pandemic?\n If it had been up to the federal government, we would have run an open borders, open business policy akin to what was done in the USA with consequent massive loss of life. We were saved from this by the fortitude of the State governments.\n Could you give me a political issue that you think isn't getting enough attention? What would the New Liberals do about this issue?\n There is massive corruption at the federal level, and the media does not focus nearly enough on that. We will create an ICAC [Independent Commission Against Corruption] with teeth, meaning a body which will have the power to investigate and charge, politicians, judges and bureaucrats who have been corrupt, in dereliction of their duty or who have abused their power. And there will be a separate court which will have the power to try and convict such people and sentence them to terms of imprisonment[.]\n What's a key way in which the New Liberals differentiate themselves from other parties?\n We are unlike every other party in almost every way, but the key would be our economic policy which enables us to invest in the nation via putting people back to work. This will be done through our Scheme which would enable anyone who wants a job to have one, and at a good \u2013 a job which suits their skills and interests, and if there is no such job available they will be trained for appropriate work and paid a full wage whilst training.\n One of the 10 values in your charter of core values is \"to promote Australia's environmental health by acknowledging that care for the environment and good business practice are complementary, not mutually exclusive\". Could you elaborate on what this would involve?\n So for example a government can invest in renewable energies, which is both good business practice and helpful for the environment.\n How would you describe your style of leadership?\n I have one main desire, to tell the truth at all times no matter what the consequences, and to answer the questions I am asked. I believe that inspires or should inspire confidence in a leader. I also want to always have the courage to call out the wrongs in the world, and to not be afraid to name those who are responsible and say why. The flip side of that is that I hope always to have the courage to admit when I have been mistaken."}
