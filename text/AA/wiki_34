No life jackets or lifeboats were aboard the ferry at the time of the event.\nAccording to officials, many of the bodies may have floated 25 miles down river to Bangladesh, due to strong currents. The river is a vital source of irrigation and transportation to the people along its coast. It is approximately 1,800 miles long, making rescue efforts difficult to pursue quickly. Rescuers are working around the clock in efforts to locate any remaining survivors.\nAbout 150 passengers swam to a nearby shore. The remaining passengers are missing and are feared dead.

It features original material compiled throughout the previous month after a brief mention of some of the month's biggest stories.\nIn this month's edition on the campaign trail, the leading candidates for the Americans Elect presidential nomination respond to a major announcement from that organization's board of directors, two presidential candidates in favor of react to President Barack Obama's announcement of support for the practice, and \"Wikinews\" interviews the newly-selected Libertarian Party vice presidential nominee.\nSummary.\nMay began with the expected withdrawal of former Newt Gingrich, who felt the continuation of his campaign to be fruitless. He endorsed former Massachusetts Mitt Romney, whom the press had already designated as the presumptive Republican Party presidential nominee. Shortly thereafter, former candidate Rick Santorum also threw his support to Romney. Another former Republican candidate, former New Mexico Gary Johnson, took a different path. He won the presidential nomination of the Libertarian Party to continue his campaign into the general election. Congressman Ron Paul remained a candidate in the Republican race, but scaled back his campaign, announcing the suspension of active campaigning while still competing in state conventions to amass delegates.\nRomney swept the Republican primaries in West Virginia, North Carolina, and Indiana, but President Obama had some difficulty in the Democratic primaries in the first two states. 41 percent of Democrats in West Virginia favored prison inmate over the president and 21 percent in North Carolina voted uncommitted over Obama. North Carolina voters also passed an amendment defining marriage as an institution between a man and woman despite vice president Joe Biden's vocal support for same-sex marriage prior to the vote. Biden's statement and the North Carolina result prompted Obama to make an announcement. During an interview with , Obama explained that his views had \"evolved\" and that he now supports same-sex marriage. Romney countered, responding that \"marriage is a relationship between a man and a woman.\"\nObama's primary difficulties continued later in May, as attorney John Wolfe, Jr. of Tennessee won 42 percent against him in the Arkansas primary, and as a similar margin of voters supported uncommitted over the president in Kentucky. Romney easily won the two states' Republican contests, but later faced potential troubles of his own. ' published a lengthy article alleging that Romney bullied a student while in high school. Romney said he did not remember the episode and apologized for the \"dumb things\" he did in school. Subsequently, the alleged victim's family disputed the story. Next, the Obama campaign attempted to make an issue of Romney's activities as CEO of . , the Democratic Mayor of , criticized this attempt, arguing on ' that advertisements against the firm left him \"uncomfortable.\" Booker later clarified that he supported and still intended to help re-elect Obama as president. In what \"Real Clear Politics\" described as an attempt to counter the attacks on Bain and highlight high unemployment as an issue, Romney predicted that if elected, unemployment would fall to six percent at the end of his first term. The Obama campaign and supporters said the announcement was nothing new since it simply mirrored the 's projections for 2016, regardless of who wins the election.\nIn late May, Romney won the endorsements of former President George W. Bush and former Condoleezza Rice. Rice's immediate predecessor, General Colin Powell, who endorsed Obama in 2008, withheld an official endorsement, but like Obama, announced his support for same-sex marriage. In the final primary of the month, both Obama and Romney each handily won their respective party's contest in Texas. As a result, Romney surpassed the required number of delegates to secure the Republican nomination and Obama faced his last contested primary on the Democratic side. However, the question of whether Obama's nomination would be unanimous remained unanswered as lawsuits from Judd and Wolfe disputed the party's decision to not award them delegates for which they qualified in the aforementioned West Virginia and Arkansas primaries.\nAmericans Elect makes major decision; leading candidates respond.\nAmericans Elect, the non-profit organization that spent an estimated $35 million to attain ballot access in 29 states with hopes of nominating a bipartisan 2012 presidential ticket, decided in May to forego the 2012 presidential race. Via press release, the organization's board announced that none of its candidates had met the minimum threshold, which required the accumulation of 10,000 pledged supporters for \"experienced\" candidates, and 50,000 supporters for other candidates, prior to the May 15 deadline. Though this decision drew criticism, the board claimed its actions were to maintain the integrity of the organization's rules.\nAs a result, candidates that actively sought the organization's nomination including former Louisiana Buddy Roemer, former , activist , and economics professor were forced to reassess how to continue their campaigns.\nRoemer, who led all candidates with 6,293 supporters, called the decision disappointing and commented that \"Americans Elect's procedure was ripe with difficulty related to access, validation and security.\" Though he simultaneously sought the Reform Party's nomination, Roemer ultimately decided that the party's ballot access in four states was not enough, and suspended his campaign at the end of May.\nAnderson, who finished second in supporters with 3,390, referred to the Americans Elect process as \"discriminatory\", and announced his support for a movement within the organization, headed by delegate Andrew Evans, attempting to overturn the board's decision. Meanwhile, Anderson removed all references to Americans Elect from the front page of his campaign website, and has focused his energies on the , which he founded last year. It currently has ballot access in Mississippi and Utah. Anderson is also a candidate for the , which will appear on the California ballot.\nRisley, who came in third with 2,351 supporters, argued that \"people feel really used and manipulated\" by Americans Elect. In a letter to the board, she wrote that the organization \"will be stigmatized as the latest example of third party failure\", \"Instead of being the prototype for high tech democracy\". Like Anderson, she supports the actions of Evans, and has even opened a petition for it on . Since Risley is not competing for another party's presidential nomination, this is now the crux of her campaign.\nKotlikoff, who finished fourth with 2,027 supporters, told \"Wikinews\" that he felt the Americans Elect board was more interested in attracting \"big names\" than focusing on the issues. He cited this as \"the most disappointing aspect\" of the decision, adding that \"big names don't necessarily equate to big ideas or good ideas for moving the country ahead. And all big names start small.\" Like Roemer, Kotlikoff had decided to also seek the Reform Party nomination, and following the decision, choose to end his Reform Party bid and his presidential campaign as a whole. He opted instead to promote his \"Purple Plan\", which combines elements of Republican and Democratic solutions to resolve political issues.\nTwo candidates react to President Obama's same-sex marriage backing.\nAfter President Obama announced his personal support of same-sex marriage while maintaining it should be decided on a state-by-state basis, two candidates already supporting marriage equality reacted in two very different ways.\nRepublican Fred Karger, the first openly gay person to seek a major political party's presidential nomination, sent an e-mail to supporters praising Obama for the announcement, saying that \"he will be a great advocate as we do battle [against marriage definition propositions] in four states this November.\" He added, \"It's nice to have another presidential candidate on board for full equality.\"\nFormer New Mexico governor Gary Johnson, the Libertarian Party presidential nominee, had an opposite interpretation of Obama's announcement. He commented, \"while I commend [Obama] for supporting the concept of gay marriage equality, I am profoundly disappointed in the President.\" \"Instead of insisting on equality as a U.S. Constitutional guarantee, the President has thrown this question back to the states.\" Johnson speculated that Obama cared more about not alienating voters in the swing states of Ohio, Colorado, North Carolina, and Virginia, than supporting change on a federal level.\nWhen approached with this view, Karger argued, \"sure, [I] would rather [Obama] came out for a federal marriage solution...[but]\" \"just his coming out for marriage equality is the key.\" Karger maintained that the issue would ultimately be decided in the courts rather than in Congress.\nKarger is currently campaigning as an alternative to Mitt Romney in California ahead of that state's June 5 GOP primary, while Johnson, whom Karger has described as a friend, is hoping to achieve ballot access in all 50 states to challenge President Obama and the Republican nominee in the general election.\nThe Libertarian Party's newly-christened VP nominee discusses his role.\nAfter the Libertarian Party nominated former New Mexico governor Gary Johnson for president at May's , upon Johnson's request, the party selected Judge of California for Vice President to complete the ticket.\nGray has worked as a judge since 1983 when appointed him to the Santa Ana Municipal Court in , California. Six years later he was appointed to the Superior Court of Orange County. His work in court earned him two \"Judge of the Year\" awards: first in 1992 from the Business Litigation Section of the Orange County Bar Association, and then in 1995 from the Orange County Constitutional Rights Foundation.\nIn addition to his work as a jurist, Gray has been involved in (MADD) and has advocated against the federal government's prosecution of the . Moreover, Gray's vice presidential campaign is not his first experience in politics. He ran for U.S. Congress as a Republican in 1998, and was the Libertarian Party's 2004 nominee for U.S. Senate in California.\nJohnson described him as \"not only a highly-respected jurist, but he is also a proven leader on issues of concern to Americans \u2013 from drug policy to civil liberties to ethics. I am proud he is joining me to offer America a real choice in this election, and excited that his forceful and extremely credible voice will be a vital part of our campaign. Judge Gray is a reformer with the track record and credentials to prove it\".\nGray reserved some time to speak with \"Wikinews\" about his role as the Libertarian Party vice presidential nominee, what he adds to the Johnson ticket, and what Johnson-Gray can do to better than the 0.4 percent former Congressman Bob Barr and businessman won as the 2008 representatives of the Libertarian Party.\nWhat are your responsibilities as the Libertarian Party vice presidential nominee?\nHow do you complement Gary Johnson on the ticket?\nHow do you plan to achieve more electoral success than the 2008 Barr-Root campaign?"}

He came in first in 36 counties and finished only 16 points behind President Barack Obama, who won the primary with 95,382 votes for 58 percent. The result tops prison inmate 's 41 percent West Virginia primary showing against Obama two weeks ago as the strongest outing for a Democratic challenger thus far. According to \"The Green Papers\", Wolfe qualified for 19 delegates, which the party has already announced they will deny.\nWolfe, who is concerned about the influence of in the Obama administration, announced his primary challenge to Obama last year. So far, along with Arkansas, he has qualified for the primary ballot in New Hampshire, Missouri, Louisiana and Texas. Before Tuesday, his strongest showing came in Louisiana, where he won 12 percent overall with over 15 percent in some congressional districts, qualifying him for delegates. However, these were stripped after the party claimed Wolfe had not filed the necessary paperwork. He has announced plans to take legal action against the party, and in an interview with \"Wikinews\" last week, commented, \"the Democratic Party decided to avert, quite flagrantly, the will of the people and assign all the delegates to Mr. Obama, even though their bylaws, the rules themselves say that the results of the primary are binding...They forsook their own law in order to make it look like there was unanimous support for Obama.\"\nAlthough President Obama has won enough delegates in this election cycle to secure the Democratic Party nomination, previously unknown challengers such as Wolfe have qualified for delegates. In March, anti-abortion activist and perennial candidate qualified for delegates in Oklahoma, but later had them stripped by the party for not filing delegate slates and, in Terry's case, not qualifying as a \"bona-fide\" candidate. The same outcome occurred for Judd in West Virginia, and as mentioned above, for Wolfe in Louisiana and Arkansas.\nAfter the announced prior to Tuesday's vote that any delegates Wolfe gains will not be seated, Wolfe told \"\" he would pursue further legal action, proclaiming, \"It will be a summer of litigation. \u2026 I hate to do it against my own party, but they\u2019re acting as if this guy [Obama] is some kind of emperor.\"\nThe last Democratic Party presidential incumbent, Bill Clinton, faced fewer challenges than Obama during his , but the party still had to deal with a candidate that won delegates. Challenger qualified for delegates in Louisiana and Virginia that year, but the party stripped these, claiming LaRouche's views were \"explicitly racist and anti-Semitic.\" Like Wolfe, LaRouche proceeded to sue the party, but was unsuccessful.\nRegardless of whether the party ultimately awards the delegates, some analysts say the results provide insights into voters' perception of Obama. Peter Grier of \"\" explained that \"white working-class voters\", who make up a majority in Arkansas, \"have been disproportionately hurt by the economic downturn, and they're resistant to what they see as Obama\u2019s liberal health-care reforms and support of gay marriage.\" Republican Congressman of Oklahoma argued \"Obama fares poorly in states like ... Arkansas because he has nothing in common with them. They are rural, he is urban. They are populist, he is elitist. And in case anyone hadn\u2019t noticed, they are conservative while he is liberal.\" Former Democratic Congressman largely agreed, commenting \"The most significant factor is the perception/reality that the Obama administration has leaned toward the ultra-left viewpoint on almost all issues.\" \nOthers have dismissed the results, arguing it is a foregone conclusion that Obama will not win Arkansas in the general election, and that opposition there may be the result of racism against Obama, the first president. of \"\" published an article questioning whether racism played a role and concluded that though it likely did, \"simply labeling [the people of] Arkansas who backed Tennessee lawyer John Wolfe over the incumbent as 'racists' is a major oversimplification.\" political scientist warned Democrats against overlooking the results, saying \"Obama will never carry white working class. But he can\u2019t afford to lose it by massive margins, either.\"\nThe \"Associated Press\" asked a few Arkansas voters how they cast their ballot and why. One voter, described as a 57-year-old resident of , said she voted for John Wolfe because she \"wasn\u2019t satisfied with Obama\" and had a particular concern about . An 85-year-old retiree from , Arkansas said he also voted for Wolfe, but called it \"a wasted vote...I guess you just do it in opposition.\" \nAs for the Obama supporters, one Little Rock voter said he cast his ballot for Obama, even though \"I am not entirely happy with what he is doing.\" Another, identified as a 51-year-old attorney from Lonoke, said she voted for Obama and fully supports him because \"he stands up for what he believes in and he has not wavered.\" One 73-year-old retired aircraft mechanic said he voted for Obama because \"they don\u2019t have but two names on the ballot: President Obama and that other guy [John Wolfe], [and] I don\u2019t know anything about the other guy.\" \nIn other races on Tuesday, \"uncommitted\" won a similar margin as Wolfe against Obama in the Kentucky Democratic primary. On the Republican side, former Massachusetts Mitt Romney easily won both the Arkansas and Kentucky primaries with 68.3 percent and 66.8 percent, respectively. \nThe next primary will be held May 29 in Texas. Wolfe will be on the ballot alongside Obama, historian Darcy Richardson, and activist Bob Ely."}

The event \u2014 which is entirely the work of more than 700 volunteers according to coordinator Colin Aprill \u2014 generated around 5 million for the \"Valley of the Sun\" during its four-day run. \"Wikinews\" was there.\nAs one unknown source from the crowd was overheard saying, \"It's all about the fans.\" Descending into the hall by escalator gave a sense of the scale to the creativity in the center. Fans could be seen scattering about in a flurry of motion on their way from one event to another and producing their own spectacle, most in costume, on their way. \nThis year the four-day convention in the Valley was estimated to set a new attendance record as 30,000 visitors showed. Most were clothed in costumes that transformed themselves into , creeper box heads, , Lady and Knight couple, , , Star Trek officers, ' Empire troopers, , and . One of the most common activities at Comicon was people taking photos of each other while they took turns posing or snapping shots.\nThe Camp family stopped intermittently to have their photos taken by others. The Camps were led by eldest brother Jim \"Batman\" Camp. He attended Comicon with his sister Tina \"Good Witch\" Camp, who brought her daughter Katie \"Super Woman.\" Sibling Tony Camp, who attended with his daughter Stella \"Bat Girl,\" was said to be \"the instigator\" behind the family's turnout at Comicon. \"You get to be dressed up and can act goofy, and you don't feel weird because everybody is dressing up, too,\" said Tony about the family-friendly event. \nThe exhibit hall was filled with artists and merchants selling comic books, trinkets, memorabilia, wares and keepsakes. Amidst the shoppers, the photo opportunities continued to attract the most attention. For all the star-studded autograph booths and an artist alley with famed comic book artists, the most fun was simply enjoying the presence of other fans in costume. \nThe Thirteenth Floor Haunted House took advantage of the photo-op activity by supplying monsters \"Nemesis\" and \"Collosus\" for more of this activity. Manager Tim Pugsley says the company owns five out of the top 1300 haunted houses in the United States. The monsters' human counterparts remained anonymous on purpose. \"The characters don't get ruined that way,\" said a handler. \nMontana E. had his picture taken with \"Nemesis\" by friend Joey Deihl, while Eddie Deleon and young Raquel Munguia posed with \"Collosus.\"\nFans also gathered Saturday for a event, in which people danced or acted to mega-hit song . An entertainment group calling themselves \"The Zombie Chicks\" attended the flash mob and then later drifted in trance through the exhibitor hall of the convention center. \"We're here for the performance, not for the stuff,\" said Tori Hoganson, who pointed like a bored consumer at the trinkets in a stall. She was careful to use as few words as possible to speak her mind out of character before going back mindfully to her mindless performance. She was accompanied by her friends, who in human form are known as Emmalaine Wright and Lyle Yanak. The group was watched closely and held at bay by \"The Keeper\" Ben Fondren, who lurked nearby as a faceless shadow.\nThe fans also turned out to see big stars, like , who portrayed in the original \"Star Trek\" series; , who is synonymous with the ship's engineer in ; or , who was the sometimes hero and sometimes anti-hero in the TV series .\nFather and son John and David Phelps, who are both \"Star Trek\" fans, attended the event together and were excited to see Shatner. \"He can be funny, but he's also fun to laugh at,\" said John Phelps with a smile. His son David liked to laugh at Shatner when the artist attempted to sing. Shatner has had an alternative \"tongue-in-cheek\" career singing hits such as on the 2004 album .\nHunter Lewis got Jon Bernthal's autograph, which came penned with the message, \"I F@&amp;#'in hate Zombies.\" Zombies were the main source of the angst that bedeviled characters in his hit TV show. Hunter's friends Justin Rose, Ryan Scola and Taylor Fagen also met with Bernthal in the autograph line. This was just one of many examples of how friends and family were bonding and sharing together in the spectacle throughout the convention center.\nThere were also breakout sessions for classes, performances, gaming, and crafts. Nyki Robertson Crosby, a.k.a. \"Lady Thunder,\" who is the matriarch of one of the largest houses for the Society for Creative Anachronism in the Phoenix area, sponsored a class on creating a \"Basic T-shirt Tunic\" so that anyone who wanted to attend an S.C.A. event in costume could fit in with a minimal investment in time, effort and money. She said the secret is to create a costume that could be one someone would wear between 600\u20131600 A.D. \"We're the Society of Creative Anachronism and not the Society of Creative Accuracy,\" Robertson Crosby said.\nThe Phoenix Comicon was carnivalesque in its look and feel. And it spread well beyond the convention center as knights and Wonderland characters and more walked the streets of Phoenix and lunched and dined with the \"civilians\". The civilians were the ones who kept asking, \"What's going on?\"\nThey may have been \"out of towners\" visiting the \"Valley of the Sun\" between May 24\u201327, because after ten years, Phoenix now has an established tradition.\nThis year's largest Comicon is to be San Diego 2012, July 12\u201315 in ."}

The court previously held he financed a war which left an estimated 50,000 dead.\nTaylor, 64, is considered likely to remain incarcerated for life if the sentence stands, but his legal team has vowed to appeal. The prosecution sought an 80-year sentence. Taylor's is the first conviction of a head of state by an international tribunal since the fallout from World War Two, when the were underway.\nThe Special Court for Sierra Leone, which is operating from the Netherlands to avoid unrest if Taylor were tried in Africa, spent more than a year deliberating before convicting Taylor last month. Acquitted of ordering crimes or of acting in a joint enterprise to conduct them, he was nonetheless convicted of aiding and abetting the offences. There were 94 prosecution witnesses and 21 for the defence.\nThe allegations date to civil war in Sierra Leone, which ran from 1991 to 2002. Taylor, who had been a warlord since the '80s, backed the rebel (RUF). Taylor was elected Liberian president in 1997 after a different civil war concluded. \nSix years later he was ousted when an arrest warrant was issued and fled to Nigeria. He was arrested there in 2006 whilst again trying to flee and went on trial later that year. Taylor, who had been facing a rebellion against him since 1999 in Liberia, received training from late Libyan ruler Colonel Muammar Gaddafi's regime.\nTestimony included claims that Taylor-backed fighters adorned roads with human intestines and ate human flesh. One claimed to have seen Taylor himself eat human liver, something Taylor denied. One described asking RUF rebels to sever his only hand in exchange for his young son's life.\nFurther allegations said teenage children were involved in the fighting and that Taylor sold illegally mined diamonds to finance arms purchases for the RUF. Western celebrities , a model, and , an actress, described an incident at a charity dinner held by , then South Africa's head, in 1997. Campbell and Farrow said Taylor gifted Campbell a number of diamonds. Taylor is claimed to have ordered seizure of Sierra Leone's diamond deposits by RUF soldiers.\nIt was claimed in court that child soldiers were used in conflict, as diamond mine guards, and to carry out amputations. Allegations of forced amputation were made. Taylor was convicted in late April of aiding and abetting forcing amputation, as well as rape, murder, child soldier recruitment, sexual slavery, and pillaging.\nThe court's panel of judges, presided over by Judge Richard Lussick, heard a 30-minute address by Taylor at an earlier sentencing hearing. \"I express my sadness and sympathy for crimes suffered by individuals and families in Sierra Leone,\" said Taylor, adding he acted \"with honour\" and as a peacemaker, asking for \"reconciliation, not retribution\" in sentencing. Taylor also gave evidence at his own trial, spending seven months of testimony saying he strove for peace in the region.\nLussick noted the panel felt 80 years to be excessive given that Taylor was cleared of directly carrying out offences. However, the court found other factors aggravated the case: In particular, he was a head of state. \"Leadership must be carried out by example by the prosecution of crimes, not the commission of crimes,\" Lussick said in court. \"The special status of Mr. Taylor as a head of state puts him in a different category of offenders for the purpose of sentencing,\" the judge said, with the convict \"in a class of his own\".\n\"[His] positions both as president of Liberia and within the west African regional bodies distinguish him from any other individual that has appeared before this court,\" Prosecutor Brenda Hollis said at a sentencing hearing. \"Taylor's abuse of his authority and influence is especially egregious given that west African leaders repeatedly entrusted him with a role to facilitate peace.\" She had claimed \"No significant mitigating circumstances exist in this case.\"\nLussick also told the court today Taylor stood convicted of \"aiding and abetting, as well as planning, some of the most heinous and brutal crimes recorded in human history\". \"The lives of many more innocent civilians in Sierra Leone were lost or destroyed as a direct result of his actions.\" These were, the court said, crimes of the \"utmost gravity in terms of scale and brutality\". The prosecution had claimed Taylor followed no more motivation beyond simple greed and power lust. Lussick said today the judges were unanimous in imposing a term of 50 years.\nThe defence had called for a sentence that gave Taylor a realistic prospect of eventual release. They also noted he is set to be sent to the United Kingdom to serve sentence. The defendant would be \"culturally isolated\", facing a \"punishment within a punishment\". At least one war crimes convict has been attacked in prison in the UK, and it is anticipated Taylor will end up in a high-security prison after the UK has promised to uphold an agreement to imprison him there made by ex-Foreign Secretary Margaret Beckett.\n\"The sentence is clearly excessive, clearly disproportionate to his circumstances, his age and his health and does not take into account the fact that he stepped down from office voluntarily,\" said counsel for the accused Morris Anya. The prosecution may also appeal the sentencing, and the verdict itself with intent to increase Taylor's convictions beyond merely aiding and abetting. The defence also intends to appeal the verdict. \nThe appeals process means Taylor is likely to remain at The Hague for several months, where the court has been holding sessions in nearby . He is the last defendant to face trial before the Special Court, which has previously convicted and sentenced eight other prominent figures in the conflict."}

Smaller violations can be dealt with by detention of up to fifteen days, and up to 200 hours of community service is available as an alternative sentence to a fine. Protestors are banned from concealing their faces and nobody with a criminal record may organise a protest.\nSupporters say the bill is required for public safety. Putin explained protests \"must be organized in such way that they inflict no damages to other citizens, who do not take part in them\" and insisted authorities \"should apply the new law in such a way that it does not limit the citizens\u2019 right for expression over any issue of internal or external politics, including street marches, events and rallies\".\nDmitry Peskov, Putin's spokesperson, said the law would be published in Saturday's edition of the \"\"; it takes effect instantly upon publication.

He today spoke of last year's \"mass riots, torched cars and robbed stores\" in the UK.\nThe law has faced local and international criticism.

It features original material compiled throughout the previous month after a brief mention of some of the month's biggest stories.\nIn this month's edition on the campaign trail, a presidential candidate who announced his 2012 plans to \"Wikinews\" four years ago speaks to \"Wikinews\" once again, the candidate leading the California presidential primary discusses his campaign, and \"Wikinews\" explores whether Senator of Kentucky will be selected as the Republican Party vice presidential nominee.\nSummary.\nIn June, California held presidential primary elections for both the Democratic and Republican parties. President Barack Obama was uncontested on the Democratic ballot, and easily won; as did presumptive nominee Mitt Romney on the Republican side. Other presidential primaries in California involved the , , , and Libertarian third parties, though not all of these were binding. In the binding Green primary, physician edged comedienne to secure enough delegates to become the party's presumptive presidential nominee. As for other primaries in June, the Republican Party held its final in Utah late in the month with Romney easily claiming victory. Afterwards, Fred Karger, the first openly gay presidential candidate for a major party's nomination, officially ended his campaign.\nStarting off, the had a few difficulties in June: a jobs report for the previous month showed a spike in the rate; Democrats failed to win a against the Republican governor in Wisconsin, bolstering Romney's prospects in the state; Romney called Obama \"out of touch\" for his remark that \"The private sector is doing just fine\"; and despite Obama's position against extending the for the wealthy, former Democratic president Bill Clinton suggested during a \"\" interview that in current circumstances, extending the Bush tax cuts would be \"probably the best thing to do right now.\" Clinton's spokesman later clarified that Clinton backed the president's position. However, consumer advocate and frequent presidential candidate speculated that Clinton was \"undermining Obama...to appear with Hillary as very friendly to business\" in order to lay the groundwork for a 2016 Hillary Clinton presidential run. \nThe Romney campaign faced a few challenges of its own: reports surfaced that Romney impersonated police officers in his youth; Obama attacked him for his investments' alleged outsourcing of jobs; and vice president Joe Biden discussed his , portraying him as an elitist at odds with the middle class. Nevertheless, a large amount of Romney coverage in June focused on his search for a . After \"\" reported that Senator of Florida was not being vetted as a possible vice presidential candidate, Romney disputed the report and claimed that in fact Rubio was being vetting for the nomination. Additionally, two prospects, former Minnesota and former Condoleezza Rice, both took their names out of consideration for the spot, though Rice reportedly 'stole the show' at a Romney retreat. At the end of June, Senator of Ohio received increased mention as a potential nominee after Senator John McCain jokingly told a group of Portman interns, \"now you can say you interned for Vice President Portman.\"\nIn mid-June, Obama injected the issue of immigration into the campaign when he announced by decree that illegal immigrants at most 30 years old who entered the United States before the age of 16 and remain in good standing in their communities, would no longer be deported. During the announcement, ' reporter Neil Munro interrupted the president to ask how the move would affect American workers. A frustrated Obama acknowledged the interruption, and responded, \"It\u2019s not time for questions, sir...Not while I\u2019m speaking.\" The interruption threatened to overshadow Obama's announcement, which analysts suggested was aimed to solidify support among Hispanics. Romney did not explicitly respond to the announcement, but said during an interview with ' that he instead would implement \"a long-term solution\". About two weeks after the announcement, \"\" analyst Aaron Blake of 's \"The Fix\" examined polls from and reported that though many voters in the swing states of Florida, Pennsylvania, and Ohio favored the new policy, those concerned about the issue were much more likely to oppose it. Blake concluded that the new policy would likely help Obama in the Latino-heavy swing states of Colorado and Nevada, but might possibly hurt him in Pennsylvania and Ohio.\nOther political events shaped the campaign as June came to a close. The U.S. Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the as a tax. Though deemed a political victory for President Obama, Romney proclaimed that the ruling brought a \"greater urgency\" to the election, explaining to his base that repealing the health care bill now required Obama to be voted out of office. In the first three hours after the ruling, the Romney campaign raised one million dollars, a spokesman reported. On the same day as the decision, the U.S. House of Representatives voted to hold in for refusing to hand over documents related to . President Obama claimed the documents fell under . Many congressional Democrats walked out during the vote and accused Republicans of playing politics. Pollsters said Holder was the most unpopular member of the Obama administration but predicted groups outside the Romney campaign would focus on the issue, in order to not divert Romney from his message on the economy. The Romney campaign ran ads at the end of June that used footage of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, polled as the most popular member of the Obama administration, criticizing Obama during the for \"perpetuating falsehoods\", concluding with \"Shame on you, Barack Obama.\" On June 30, Obama led Romney in the national \"\" average, 47.5 percent to 43.8 percent.\nWikinews interviews Green Party candidate.\nIn addition to Jill Stein and Roseanne Barr, , an air quality inspector from , participated in June's California Green Party presidential primary. He finished the contest in third place with 10.8 percent behind Stein's nomination-clinching showing of 49.3 percent and Barr's second place 39.9 percent. In the aftermath of the primary and ahead of the July 12\u201315 , \"Wikinews\" reached out to Mesplay.\nMesplay, who serves as a delegate to the Green National Committee, had previously sought the Green presidential nomination in 2004 and 2008, falling short both times. \"Wikinews\" first interviewed Mesplay during his second presidential campaign in June 2008, when he announced his intentions to seek the Green Party's 2012 presidential nomination. During his 2012 bid, Mesplay has campaigned on his support for , , , and reductions in . He has received the endorsements of party co-founder , 2004 Green Party vice presidential nominee , and Green activist .\nWith \"Wikinews\", Mesplay discusses his thoughts on Stein and Barr, in general, and his future political plans.\n With the outcome of the California primary, physician Jill Stein has secured enough delegates to be the Green Party presumptive presidential nominee. What are your thoughts on Stein and her policy proposals? How do they compare to your own and have you discussed the vice presidential nomination with her?\n Comedienne Roseanne Barr, who finished second in California, seems to be hinting that she may continue her campaign as an Independent after the National Convention. What is your reaction to Roseanne and her campaign? Has she had a positive influence on the Green Party?\n When we last interviewed in June 2008, it was under similar circumstances: you were seeking the Green Party presidential nomination; the National Convention was just a few weeks away; and like Stein, Congresswoman Cynthia McKinney had already secured enough delegates to be the party's presumptive nominee. At the time, you mentioned that you were \"taking the steps to begin running for the 2012 presidential race.\" Now, at this point in the 2012 race, do you have similar plans to run for president in 2016?\nAmerican Independent Party primary results.\nThe American Independent Party (AIP), a group formerly affiliated with the Constitution Party that has guaranteed ballot access in California, listed three presidential candidates on its ballot for June's California primary: the party's former chairman ; radio talk show host ; and former \"Mad\" Max Riekse.\nIn the tally last updated on June 26, Noonan led Roth 16,625 votes (38.8 percent) to 16,044 (37.4 percent) with Riekse polling 10,227 votes (23.8 percent) for third place. \"Wikinews\" tried to contact the leading two candidates, but only successfully connected with Noonan.\nNoonan, who ran for both in 2006 and U.S. Senate in 2010 as the AIP nominee, told \"Wikinews\" that the \"only purpose\" for his run was to \"have standing\" in a lawsuit against President Barack Obama. Noonan, who refers to Obama as \"Mr. Soetero\", said his most recent suit was dismissed in court. He believes Obama's birth certificate \"is forged and a fraudulent document\" due to \"multiple layers of different typewriter font sizes\", signatures in \"multi-colored [ink] and sliced into the document in different patches.\" Furthermore, he says that without a legitimate birth certificate, Obama \"cannot prove that he is an American citizen [because his]... was a foreign national from Kenya\". Noonan says that this disqualifies Obama from being president.\nAs a candidate, Noonan has sent out press releases and made numerous attempts to spread his message through the internet; however, he has received very little media attention. He argues that people are indifferent to politics and that the \"corrupt news media\" ignores third party candidates such as himself. Additionally, he sees the two major parties as corrupt and refers to them as \"two heads from the same beast.\" He describes his opponent Roth as \"a Republican traitor\" and feels the AIP made a mistake by listing such a non-member on the primary ballot.\nRoth, who says she feels God has called her to seek the presidency, unsuccessfully sought the Constitution Party presidential nomination earlier this year. On her website, she calls for the institution of a two percent , the eventual repeal of all other taxes, and the elimination of the national debt in four to five years. Ahead of the primary, she received the endorsement of notable birther activist . \"Wikinews\" has made numerous attempts to contact Roth, but has thus far received no response.\nFormer congressman Virgil Goode, the Constitution Party's presidential nominee, and , the presidential nominee, are both also reportedly seeking the AIP nomination despite not being listed on the primary ballot. The nominating convention is scheduled to take place August 11.\nMight Rand Paul be the GOP VP nominee?\nAfter Senator of Kentucky endorsed presumptive Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney in June, speculation spread that Romney might select Paul as his running mate. However, according to two political analysts, the scenario is unlikely and may not be strategically wise for Republicans. \nPaul, who holds libertarian views similar to those of his father, Congressman and 2012 Republican presidential candidate Ron Paul of Texas, announced his endorsement of Romney on \"\". He cited Romney's support for a audit, a repeal of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, and opposition to the Stop Online Piracy Act as rationale for the move. However, Paul did not mention his policy disagreements with Romney on such issues as the , the , and the . \nSome libertarians and supporters of Ron Paul reacted angrily to the decision. The Libertarian Party released a statement saying \"no true libertarian, no true friend of liberty, and no true blue Tea Partier could possibly even consider, much less actually endorse or approve of, the Father of Obamacare, Big Government tax and spender, Republican Mitt Romney.\" \nNevertheless, some saw it as an attempt for Paul to position himself as a potential vice presidential candidate. Paul said it would be \"a great honor\" for Romney to consider him as a running mate. Proponents of this idea, such as Daniel McCarthy of \"\", say Paul would help steer Republicans and the possible Romney administration away from and policies. Others do not view this as sound campaign strategy.\nAccording to North Star Opinion Research strategist Dan Judy, the endorsement was simply Paul's \"way of supporting the Republican team and hoping to curry some favor with the Romney folks in hopes of getting his dad a speaking slot at the \". Though Judy held that the pick would help Romney with those concerned about Romney's such as the \"hard core Tea Party base\", he sees Paul's political inexperience, questionable appeal to political and , and the lack of any geographic advantage for the ticket as reasons that the scenario has \"virtually no shot\".\nPolitical analyst Kyle Kondik of largely agrees, stating that the selection would be a \"real surprise\" and that though \"supporters of Ron and Rand Paul are a vocal part of the Republican Party, they are but one small constituency, and their views, particularly on matters of war and peace, are too different from Romney and the Republican mainstream to imagine Rand (or Ron) in the No. 2 slot on the ticket.\""}

Discussing his qualms in detail during a November 2011 \"Wikinews\" interview, Richardson cited Obama's extension of the , his inability to include a in his , his failure to renew the and pass legislation, and his seeming reluctance to defend and .

Overall he received a total of 41,386 votes in the five states, 25,296 of which came during the May 29 Texas primary, after he had already suspended his campaign. \nLast April, Richardson ceased all campaign operations, and shifted focus to his news blog \"Uncovered Politics\". At the time, he said he planned to support Americans Elect and Reform Party presidential candidate Buddy Roemer, in part due to his economic plans, such as the reinstatement of Glass-Steagall. Richardson described Roemer as a \"straight-talking, anti-Wall Street former governor of Louisiana who is ... head and shoulders above any other potential third-party candidate in his conception of the current economic crisis.\" \nAfter Roemer ended his presidential campaign as a whole following Americans Elect's board decision to not nominate a 2012 ticket, Richardson was left to decide whether to support Obama's re-election or reconsider his own campaign. He ultimately chose to relaunch his campaign, and like Roemer, run for Reform Party nomination. He concluded:\n I can't in good conscience support President Obama's re-election. He's a good man, but entirely out of his league in putting the country on a path to economic recovery. The American people are hurting, and they're hurting badly.

That may not sound like much, but FFnet is big - that comes to thousands of stories.\" feckless-muse on Dreamwidth reported the purge included banning users. Despite the purge, reports no drop in traffic to FanFiction.Net.\nCritics United.\nSome in the fan community blamed Critics United for the purge, and a few Tumblr users created a group to fight them. The group earned a mention on the .\nAccording to feckless-muse, \"people reporting these so called site violations are literally ganging up on the writers and leaving comments like the ones below en masse. The poor writers are spending hours (and in some cases months and years for ongoing fics) on their works only to be abused, bullied and then having their work deleted without notice.\" With these sentiments being echoed on , jessioriginal reported threats from the group at the same time the purge took place.\nTwo months ago, David Anderson, of , created a petition condemning Critics United which drew increased interest in light of the purge. By earlier today, 224 people signed it including Danny Kleemann of Peoria, Illinois, Brian George O'Connor of Chatham, New York, Tegan Chin of Arlington, Texas, Holly Reichert of Euclid, Ohio, Claire Owen of Houston, Texas, Joanna Zhang of Charlotte, North Carolina, Amber Keystone of Monroe, Louisiana, Lily Hamilton of Charlotte, North Carolina, Allison Law of Charlotte, North Carolina and Erica Winchester of Clinton, Massachusetts who all signed today. Earlier this week, Timothy Hall signed, saying \"The profiles are being deleted due to either content violations or inactivity, including the stories in connection with the profiles. Most of profile and story deletions are because of depicted content about adult or violent themes being detailed beyond its 'suggestion' even in the slightest manner.\" \nSo great was one person's anger, they created a page about Critics United on Encyclopedia Dramatica several months ago. People mentioned this and praised people trolling Critics United on Tumblr and LiveJournal as recently as yesterday.\nFan response.\nTwelve days ago, a FanFiction.Net contributor named Charlotte Weatherly created a petition on requesting FanFiction.Net stop its own destruction by purging stories. Earlier today, the count of signatories stood at over 30,000, many offering their perspectives on why the site acted in error. Kara Bularzik's comment, liked over 270 times, said: \"... I cannot believe so much valuable work is being trashed because it doesn't fit parameters that have not been strictly enforced since they were put into action. [...] What is the point of a ratings system if anything disagreeable is automatically purged? [...] I am truly disheartened, and I hope either a different course of action is taken or I wish ff.net and its future users (all within the PG reading range) the best as I sadly look for a site where one can truly 'unleash their imagination'.\" Zaynab Quadri's comment, liked 88 times, expressed a similar sentiment: \"Writers give warnings when they write explicit content, so if anyone's reading anything they shouldn't be, that's their own fault. Let the writers have freedom of speech.\" Lex Black's comment, liked by 30 people, said: \"Some of the best stories are being threatened by this. This rule hasn't been inforced for ten years and limiting creativity now is ridicules. If it upsets you, then be MATURE enough to not read it.\"\nPeople continue to support the petition, with Maria Adams of San Diego, California, Matthew Sandrock of , California, Jessie Brown of , Mississippi, Cynthia Mora of , Washington, Anis Rosdi of , James Clarke of , North Carolina, Blair Ritchie of , Oregon, Rianna McMahan of , Washington, Hannah Johnson of , California and C.J.

Discussion of the petition on a FanFiction.Net message board generated over 3,000 messages, and is still active.\nOn , members urged FanFiction.Net users to back up their work lest it be deleted. Users auronlu, vieralynn and others encouraged people to spread the word of possible deletion. \nThe purge story was picked up by Hannah Ellison at the two days ago, who compared the FanFiction.Net purge to a book burning. Ellison went on to say, \"[t]hese unpaid authors are at the mercy of the sites willing to house their work and as such must adhere to the lines drawn in the very murky sand of copyright law. Some of these authors spent months writing and editing novel length works to then have them deleted entirely, as if they were something with no artistic or cultural worth; artefacts that either follow the rules or don't.\" Ellison's post earned 1,900+ Facebook likes, with 50 comments on the article. \nEllison's story appeared on several Tumblr posts. xmarisolx posted her response on Tumblr a day ago, claiming FanFiction.Net was shooting itself in the foot, driving traffic to other archives such as \"An Archive of Our Own\" (AO3). candycanine, quoting , supported Ellison's book burning reference.\nTalking to Wikinews, former fan fiction writer and current professional writer Angelia Sparrow indicated a lack of surprise over FanFiction.Net's actions saying, \"Ten years ago they purged all the NC-17 stuff. Sounds like they just did a cleanup again. We're getting more puritanical everywhere, you know? All Romance Ebooks is strongly limiting what romances can contain.\"\nLong time fan fiction writer Tikatu told Wikinews, \"The content purge hasn't bothered me at all, really, though I've been lurking around on ff.net's Critics United. They've been blamed for all the deleted stories -- never mind that they don't have enough people to have reported that many fics.\"\nAnime fan fiction writer and artist Hurricane Islandheart defended FanFiction.Net's actions, saying \"All FF.net was doing was catching up on their site maintenance and reports - people just freaked because they'd finally been caught breaking the rules.\" She reinforced this idea on her .\nFan fiction archives.\nIn response to the purge, users flocked to other sites and archives. Recommendations for sites included , , YourFanFiction.Com and \"An Archive of Our Own\" (AO3).\nAO3 experienced down time as the site's servers could not handle the additional load from FanFiction.Net users, generating a number of at the height of the problem. The site's parent organization, , not mentioning server problems on their \"Dreamwidth\" account, updated their website six days ago to discuss the situation.\nThe traffic increase came on the back of -reported increase earlier in the year, 57,201 visitors at the end of April, up from 40,560 at the end of March. Alexa reported a big drop in traffic for the archive the day of the purge and traffic has subsequently remained at above average before FanFiction.Net purge levels. This matches other organizationally reported increase. AO3 took measures to reduce server load such as disabling tag filtering, improving statistics caching, turning off alphabetical listing of users, suspending the ability for people to request invitations to and from the site. Even before FanFiction.Net's adult content purge, AO3's invitation code queue exceeded 17,000. Before the site closed registration, Tumblr user alien-rz requested a code and received a confirmation e-mail saying \"You\u2019ve been added to our queue! Yay! We estimate that you\u2019ll receive an invitation around 2012-12-13.\" \nFanFiction.Net users like fujiwara-nanaho registered for in case FanFiction.Net removed their content.\nNo problems were reported by Hurricane Islandheart on MediaMiner.Org, an anime-centric fan fiction site popular in the mid-'00s that is largely absent of moderators at the moment. The site saw an increase in traffic earlier this year, going from 24,156 at end-December, according to Quantcast, to 58,558 visitors at the end of March this year.\nAccording to Tikatu, a member of FanFiction.net Writers Unite, an eFiction software based site, YourFanFiction.com went down under the additional traffic strain. According to Tumblr users, having been created in response to the purge, the site swelled to over a thousand users including a number of Tumblr users like bluelilacflame, konata-the-espeon and getwhatyouwantorjustgetold.

The Turks claim the jet mistakenly entered Syrian airspace, but had left again after a warning and was in international airspace when it was attacked. \nThe EU has today announced fresh sanctions against Syria: Another person and six organisations were added to the EU's sanctions list, which now imposes asset freezes on 43 groups and over 100 people; the individuals also face travel bans. The growing list is in response to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's violent suppression of an uprising against his rule. China and Russia consistently use their vetoes as permanent UN Security Council members to prevent calls for al-Assad to step down.\nThe UN puts deaths at the hands of Syrian government forces at 10,000; Syria attributes 2,600 government and security forces deaths to \"terrorists\" with foreign assistance.

A Greek restructure of 200 billion in debt has caused the bank a \u20ac3.65 billion loss, and money is being lost on loans domestically and to Greek customers.\nCyprus Popular Bank chairman today revealed talks are also underway with China about a possible loan. Low taxes and regulation have attracted large amounts of foreign money to Cyprus, including much Russian money, producing a banking sector far larger than most nations that size.

The case was reopened and in 2000 a coroner recommended charging Jeffrey with murder. In a trial in 2008, after one in which the jury could not reach a verdict, the court heard expert testimony that 25-year-old Christopher's body had clustered stab wounds similar to those inflicted on Helen and Stephen.\nThe prosecution also contended the elder Gilhams had been killed before the fire was started. Jeffrey was convicted of murdering his parents and given two life sentences. He spent three years in prison before being released when his convictions were quashed in December, leaving open the question of whether he was to be retried or completely acquitted. The court has now fully acquitted the former convict in a 2\u20131 majority decision.\nThe appeal court found the forensic evidence flawed. It heard the prosecution had elected not to bring an expert to the court who felt no conclusions could be drawn from the clustered stab wounds. The court noted clusters are not uncommon, even in cases with multiple killers and victims.\nEvidence supporting the fire being lit after the elder Gilhams were dead also came under scrutiny. A US expert contradicted the prosecution case by saying Christopher and the parents had inhaled enough to demonstrate the fire started before their deaths. This was in opposition to the prosecution expert, who said a low level of the gas in Christopher's body proved he was already dead.\nTony Gilham, who submitted fresh forensic evidence to the appeal court he said undermined the defence, vowed to \"fix\" his nephew as he left the court. He said he would ask the New South Wales Director of Public Prosecutions, Lloyd Babb SC, to appeal to the High Court in a bid to retry the \"family killer\". \n\"I'm glad today that I've been acquitted of the charges,\" Jeffrey said as he too left the court.

Following Barack Obama taking office, another request was filed; again, access was denied with the Obama administration asserting that national security concerns justified the entire draft and related documents remaining secret.\n, stated Sebastian Nerz, vice-president of the . \nProtesters criticised the vague wording and legal uncertainty ACTA would have introduced. Widespread censorship of the internet and curtailment of freedom of speech were feared; patent regulations were highlighted as having potentially adverse impact on access to medicines and crop seeds. The trade agreement, which US-based pressure group described as \"giving the U.S. a structural competitive advantage over other countries\", had already amongst its signatories Australia, Canada, Japan, Morocco, New Zealand, Singapore, South Korea, and the United States.\nThe long-running campaign against ACTA can in part be traced to publication of a leaked draft of the agreement on whistleblowing site Wikileaks. Their analysis concluded one part of the document was \"a ' , and the then-leaked draft would force internet service providers to provide \"perfunctionary disclosure of customer information\" and would \"likely outlaw multi-region CD/DVD players.\""}

In response to the report, Obama proclaimed \"It\u2019s still tough out there\". Presumptive Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney responded that Obama's \"policies have not worked\" and said it's \"time for Americans to choose whether they want more of the same.\" Romney also reacted to June's \"\" Supreme Court ruling that upheld the . He explicitly referred to the individual mandate as a tax, mirroring the decision, despite comments from campaign adviser Eric Fehrnstrom, who deemed the individual mandate as a penalty, sharing the view of the Obama administration. Media mogul criticized the Romney campaign, tweeting that it needed to hire political professionals and said it was doubtful Romney could win the election. After meeting with Romney early in July, Murdoch expressed dissatisfaction with the campaign's message and its lack of attacks on the \"incompetent\" Obama administration.\nAdditionally, speculation about Romney's vice presidential selection intensified earlier in July as Romney's wife revealed that her husband was considering choosing a woman for the ticket. This came out before Romney appeared at a parade with Senator of New Hampshire, who had been mentioned as a potential pick. Other women discussed as possibilities included South Carolina , New Mexico , and former Condoleezza Rice, who took herself out of contention last month. Others receiving speculation in July included Senator of Ohio, Senator of Florida, and Louisiana . Also in early July, Romney spoke at an convention. Despite the fact that most African Americans supported Obama in 2008, Romney said, as president he \"hope[s] to represent all Americans, of every race, creed or sexual orientation, from the poorest to the richest and everyone in between.\" During the address, after he mentioned his plan to repeal Obamacare, Romney was met with a chorus of boos. Nevertheless, he continued the speech and proclaimed that if elected, conditions would improve for African Americans. He received applause after arguing in favor of traditional marriage. The next day, vice president Joe Biden addressed the convention, and alluded to , asking the audience, \"Did you think we\u2019d be fighting these battles again?\" President Obama was unable to attend the convention, but sent a taped message instead. Also, in mid-July, physician , who previously challenged Romney for governor of Massachusetts, won the presidential nomination of the left-wing Green Party. She selected homelessness activist as her running mate.\nThroughout the month, Obama continued his attacks on Romney for allegedly outsourcing jobs while at , releasing a new advertisement referring to Romney as an 'outsourcing pioneer.' However, the Romney campaign disputed the attacks as misleading. and Romney himself said that the alleged outsourcing took place during an absence from the company while focusing on the operation of the in . Obama heightened attacks on Romney's refusal to release all of his tax records, with one surrogate calling Romney's actions possibly \"felonious.\" Romney described the comment as \"beneath the dignity of the president\" and asked Obama for an apology. Obama refused, suggesting, \"Mr. Romney claims he's Mr. Fix-It for the economy because of his business experience, so I think voters entirely, legitimately want to know what is exactly his business experience.\" Furthermore, Obama argued that entrepreneurs like Romney should not take all the credit for their successes since others chipped in: \"If you\u2019ve got a business, you didn\u2019t build that. Somebody else made that happen. The internet didn\u2019t get invented on its own. Government research created the internet so then all the companies could make money off the internet.\" Romney highlighted the comments to go on the offensive against Obama; he referred to them as \"insulting to every entrepreneur, every innovator in America\". Later, citing 100 Obama fundraisers versus zero meetings with his in the last six months, Romney delivered a fiery speech in the swing state of Ohio in which he suggested that Obama's \"priority is not creating jobs for you [but]...trying to keep his own job. And that's why he's going to lose it.\"\nFollowing the , both Obama and Romney suspended campaign rhetoric out of respect to the victims. The next week, foreign policy came to the forefront as Romney embarked on an international tour to meet with foreign leaders. While in London, ahead of the , Romney suggested the city was not ready for the event, which prompted to argue that London is \"one of the busiest, most active, bustling cities anywhere in the world\" and that, as with Romney's 2002 Salt Lake City games, \"it is easier if you hold an Olympic Games in the middle of nowhere.\" After this, Romney visited Israel, where he met with , , and Palestinian , and voiced his support for Israeli actions against Iran to prevent in that nation. Romney received some criticism after a meeting in Israel in which he argued that cultural differences impacted the economic disparity between Israel and its neighbors. He completed his trip in Poland, where he received a warm reception, and endorsed a in the nation that President Obama scrapped in 2009. In response to the trip, Obama spokesman argued that Romney \"both offended our closest ally and triggered a troubling reaction in the most sensitive region of the world...He certainly didn't prove to anyone that he passed the commander-in-chief test.\" The Obama campaign announced at the end of the month that former President Bill Clinton would be given a prime-time slot at September's Democratic , while was slated to deliver the address. On July 31, Obama led Romney in the national \"\" average, 47.0 percent to 45.0 percent.\nPolling rules restrict and fuel third party campaigns.\nThird party presidential candidates are often excluded from most presidential preference polls. However, because of the criteria of the , strong showings in polls are critical for third party candidates to effectively communicate their message to voters. In addition to the to be president and the attainment of enough to potentially win the election, the Commission requires a 15 percent average in five to participate in October's three . Since these rules were adopted in 2000, no third party candidate has been invited to the debates due to the inability to meet the polling standard. \nIn early July, for the first time in this election cycle, released a national poll that included the three third party presidential nominees with the most ballot access. In addition to Romney and Obama, who registered 40 and 47 percent, respectively, the poll gauged three percent support for the Libertarian Party presidential nominee, former New Mexico governor Gary Johnson; one percent for Green Party presidential nominee Jill Stein; and less than half a percentage point for the Constitution Party presidential nominee, former Congressman Virgil Goode. According to Communication Specialist Alyssa Brown, the Gallup organization uses \"editorial judgment...including assessments of news coverage of third party and independent candidates\" to determine whether or not to include certain candidates. Brown says her firm also measures inclusion through the interpretation of \"responses to open-ended vote preference questions...[and] name identification of third party candidates.\"\nTwo other polling firms have included just Johnson in their nationwide polls for a three-way race: an April survey showed him with six percent support, and a July poll found a five percent backing. JZ Analytics Senior Analyst says that third party candidates are included in polls usually to see how they affect the race between the two main candidates. His firm added Johnson because \"libertarianism appears to be growing in support among young people...[and] we wonder if he can be a factor.\" Zogby says that additional candidates will likely be included as the election draws nearer. When asked why JZ Analytics does not simply include all ballot-qualified candidates on a state-by-state basis, he gave three reasons: expense from the time taken to read all the names; questions on how to deal with candidates that appear multiple times on the ballot; and the lack of any significant support for certain candidates, which provide no useful data when applying the view that \"the value of a poll is not to predict but to create accurate results that can be interpreted.\" \"Wikinews\" attempted unsuccessfully to contact other firms about their inclusion criteria for third party candidates.\nDespite his inclusion in some polls, Johnson does not believe it is enough. He feels that because \"only three polling organizations out of 18 are including my name,\" debate participation looks to be a nearly insurmountable task. However, he clings to the hope that if he can qualify for the debates, he can possibly win the election. Another kind of poll may assist that goal.\n, which measure voter support in individual states, do not count toward the average for the presidential debate qualification; but polling high enough in them could significantly improve a third party candidate's chances. , who worked on the of the last third party candidate to appear at the presidential debates, industrialist , and who later served as the for 2008 Libertarian Party presidential nominee Bob Barr, says the ideal strategy was to utilize local media in western states that were already \"predisposed to Libertarian viewpoints\" to work to improve statewide polling above 20 percent. Though this was never implemented due to low campaign funds, Verney believes it could have created a national news story that would have boosted the campaign's national profile and exposure, perhaps improving the showings in national polls, and like Perot, leading to debate inclusion.\nThough third party inclusion in statewide polls remains infrequent, such polls often reflect broader support. For example, in his homestate of Virginia, Virgil Goode has nine percent support in a July Public Policy Polling survey, substantially more than his national average. Jill Stein tripled her national standing with three percent in her homestate of Massachusetts in a late June Public Policy Polling poll. Nevertheless, no other third party candidate is faring as well as Johnson in multiple states: a July poll from Public Policy Polling showed him with 13 percent in his homestate of New Mexico (down from 23 percent in December); he stood at nine percent in Arizona in May; and had an eight percent backing in Montana during the same month. These showings in western states are significantly better than Johnson's national showings. Since his campaign, unlike the 2008 Barr campaign, has access to , Johnson could possibly employ the Verney strategy, and improve his chances.\nBallot access denied in Illinois.\nThe state of Illinois, which accounts for 20 votes, automatically grants ballot access to any presidential candidate that files a petition on time. However, if a petition is challenged and does not list 25,000 valid signatures, ballot access is denied. In 2008, an individual named John Joseph Polachek took advantage of this law and submitted a petition with no signatures. No one challenged this and so Polachek appeared on the ballot.\nIn this election cycle, Constitution Party nominee Virgil Goode; Justice Party nominee, former Rocky Anderson; nominee ; and candidate Michael W. Hawkins all submitted petitions with less than 25,000 signatures in hopes that they would not be contested. However, on July 2, Green Party chairman Rob Sherman filed a challenge to the four petitions, arguing the candidates did not put in the same amount of effort as the Green Party petitioners, who, along with the Libertarian Party, collected more than 25,000 signatures. He also reasoned that additional candidates would divert potential votes from the Green Party.\nSeveral third party activists and even some members of the Green Party condemned the actions, and asked that Sherman withdraw his challenges. He initially remained unwavering, but attempted to withdraw the challenges just ahead of the final court decision. The court would not allow Sherman to voice his change of heart, and proceeded to remove the four candidates from the ballot.\nAccording to Sherman, counsel Andy Finko requested that he be the main objector. He further claims that before this, Finko contacted then-presumptive presidential nominee Jill Stein's campaign chairman , who purportedly labeled the challenge as a \"decision for the Illinois Green Party and not one for the Stein campaign.\" However, Sherman says that both Manski and Stein personally contacted him a few days later, and asked that he withdraw the challenges. Sherman argued to them that he \"had staked [his] national reputation on it\" and that a withdrawal would hurt the Green Party ticket. He did not decide to withdraw the challenges until he felt the Stein campaign had completely deliberated over his arguments, which eventually came a couple of weeks later. \"Wikinews\" was unable to contact Manski or Stein to confirm that these conversations actually took place.\nVirgil Goode offers a different perspective on the challenges. He says that Sherman, a self-identified , offered to drop the Constitution Party petition challenge if Goode gave his support for the removal of \"\" from U.S. currency and \"under God\" from the . To this, Goode replied \"no deal\", explaining that he co-sponsored \"legislation in the House to put 'In God We Trust' back on the face of the Presidential dollars so that it could be readily seen by the public.\" It is not known if the other candidates were given this same opportunity, but Rocky Anderson says that he personally was not. Sherman did not respond to inquiries concerning such a deal.\nFor Goode, the decision may have affected his ability to participate in the presidential debates. Without Illinois' 20 electoral votes, he may fall short of the Commission on Presidential Debates ballot access requirements. Goode currently has access in 18 states for a total of 169 electoral votes, over 100 less than the required 270. Nevertheless, the is still working to get on the ballot in additional states. Furthermore, the removal may affect Green Party ballot access elsewhere. According to ballot access expert , the party is currently a co-plaintiff with the Constitution Party in five states in cases where ballot access laws are being challenged. He says that \"state attorneys...attack the plaintiff parties ...[using] the number of states in which each of the parties is on the ballot nationwide\" as evidence of strength or lack thereof.\n\"It's tough enough to get on state ballots without other third parties undermining the efforts\" says Anderson, whose Justice Party has thus far attained ballot access in Colorado, Utah, Oregon, Mississippi, New Mexico, and New Jersey, Anderson does not fault the entire Green Party for Sherman's \"unfortunate behavior\", but the events do affirm one thing for him: \"In my view, third parties should all hang together in promoting ballot access.\"\nWikinews interviews newly-selected Justice Party VP nominee.\nOn July 17, Rocky Anderson announced his selection of and community activist of California as his on the Justice Party presidential ticket. Rodriguez is a published poet, columnist, and author of such books as the 1993 bestseller \"\", which documents his youth and involvement in the street gangs of .\nAs an advocate for urban social change, Rodriguez hosts readings and workshops, and frequently speaks at schools, prisons, churches, homeless shelters, and migrant camps. For his activism, he has received numerous awards including 's \"Local Hero of Community\", and the \"Unsung Heroes of Compassion\" from the .\nAnderson described the vice presidential selection process as \"arduous\", but held that Rodriguez exceeded his personal expectations. He proclaimed that his running mate \"brings with him a wealth of knowledge and real-life experience, inspirational personal growth, and proven commitment to social, economic, and environmental justice.\"\nWith \"Wikinews\", Rodriguez discusses his initial reaction and reason for accepting the nomination, his responsibilities as the vice presidential nominee, and how he hopes to complement Anderson on the Justice Party ticket.\nWhy did you accept the Justice Party's vice presidential nomination, and how exactly did that nomination come about?\nWhat are your responsibilities as the Justice Party vice presidential nominee?\nHow will you complement Rocky Anderson on the ticket?"}

Moyles said he had had \"the best time of [his] life\" and wished to \"give [the listeners] a heads up and tell [them] that we are going to wrap it up\" on his show on July 11.\n\"Thanks for supporting us,\" Moyles told his audience that morning, \"and, with the risk of sounding ridiculously cheesy, for making all our dreams come true.\" To get as far as he did was like \"some weird victory\", he said, taking into account \"all the flak we've taken\".\nThe first song played on the last show was \" by featuring . The last was 's \".\nMoyles, who has referred to himself as the 'saviour of Radio 1', broke the record for the longest-running breakfast show on Radio 1 in September 2009, surpassing 's record from September 1967 to June 1973. \"The Chris Moyles Show\" has also achieved two . From later this month, Moyles is to portray the role of in a UK tour of the musical \"\". \nMoyles said his position was \"his dream job\" and one he had \"wanted since I was a child ... I wanted the biggest radio show you could get and eventually I got it\", he said. BBC Radio 1 controller considered Moyles to be \"the most successful breakfast show host in Radio 1 history\" and described him as \"fantastic\".\n, who was previously a late-night presenter at the radio station, is scheduled to replace him on September 24, although was reportedly widely anticipated to take Moyles' position after his departure before the news emerged. \"[I am] super-excited to be hosting the iconic Radio 1 Breakfast Show,\" Grimshaw said in July. \"[I]t's been a dream of mine since the age of 11 and to be honest it hasn't really sunk in yet.\" Grimshaw said he \"love[s] Chris and [has] always looked up to him as one of the best broadcasters ever\".\nHowever, Moyles' show has not been without its controversial moments. One such incident was a remark he made after his appearance on BBC television programme \"\" in January 2009. \"[U]nlike a lot of the \"Who Do You Think You Are?\" shows I didn't go to Auschwitz,\" he said. \"Pretty much everyone goes there whether or not they're Jewish. They just seem to pass through there on their way to Florida.\" The incident prompted the BBC to respond: \"[W]e regret that on this occasion his comments were misjudged and we are speaking to Chris and his team about them.\"\nIn a separate incident in a May 2006 programme, Moyles said he did not want to get a certain ringtone because it was \"gay\", prompting accusations of homophobia. In his defence, the corporation explained \"the word 'gay', in addition to being used to mean 'homosexual' or 'carefree', was often now used to mean 'lame' or 'rubbish'.\" \"The Guardian\" also quoted Moyles as saying in November 2006: \"Yeah, I'm homophobic, I don't like the gays. Sorry, it just does my head in.\" LGBT charity awarded Moyles 'Bully of the Year' at their award ceremony the same year.\nAt the time of Moyles' departure being announced in July, Cooper was reportedly placed under pressure to try and decrease the age demographic of the audience of Radio 1. Having been told the station should attempt to broadcast primarily to individuals aged between 15 and 29 by a review in 2009, a separate review by the body in June 2012 found too many of its listeners were over the age of 30.\nCooper described Grimshaw as a \"great broadcaster with a passion for music and a mischievous sense of humour\" back in July and believed he would be an \"excellent\" replacement for Moyles, \"bringing a new generation of listeners with him.\""}

She is the first woman ever to give an opening address at a Wikimania conference. The conferences have been held annually since 2005.\nJimmy Wales, co-founder of Wikipedia, echoed the theme of diversity in his remarks during his annual State of the Wiki address and expanded on Africa and including more people who are not technically savvy.\nParticipants from 87 countries gathered in on the campus of , Washington, D.C. for the opening session on Thursday morning.\nMary Gardiner focused on the lack of gender diversity within the Wikipedia community. She said reader and editor surveys have shown that while over one third of the readers of Wikipedia are women, the number of women who are editors is around 10 to 15 percent in the English Wikipedia and as low as 8.5 percent for all Wikipedias. \"As a project of social change, even if it's not an activist project, the Wikipedia community has a responsibility both to its mission and to the people out there in the world to always be on a journey toward diversity \u2014 to increase the size of the umbrella of the world\", Gardiner said.\nThe Ada Initiative, co-founded by Gardiner, encourages women's involvement in open source projects like Wikipedia, , and . Prior to the conference, the Ada Initiative sponsored an AdaCamp where women shared their experiences across these projects. Gardiner, who is a graduate student in Computational Linguistics, delivered the keynote, entitled \"Fostering diversity: not a boring chore, a critical opportunity.\" \nGardiner said Wikipedia should not only increase diversity because it would be good for the community to have more voices, but also the community should reach out with sincerity and both engage and hear women's voices and be open to change from their contributions.\nJimmy Wales recommended Wikipedians \"reexamine [their] premises.\" As an example, he asked them to consider article topics that other audiences who are not currently being served well could find meaningful. He became involved in a deletion debate about whether was worthy of an article. He contrasted this topic choice with the large number of obscure pages about and asked the audience to consider why important fashion events could be of interest to a different audience with other interests. He said if Wikipedia is not providing content for this audience, they will go elsewhere to create and read that content.\nGardiner also said when women or another subculture focus on their identity it can actually create a stronger Wikipedian identity. \"The more you encourage people retain parts of their identity that are important to them, in my case as a woman, the more you enhance their other identity as a Wikipedian... You can encourage both identities by allowing minorities to acknowledge and embrace that they are a member of a minority.\" Wikipedia has encouraged the development of subcultures through the creation of chapters, portals, and even individualized user boxes.\nJimmy Wales, on a personal note, announced that he and his partner had named their daughter Ada after , who Gardiner had explained to the audience is considered the first software programmer and was an inspiration for the Ada Initiative. Gardiner credits her fellow Ada Initiative co-founder Valerie Aurora, executive director, for naming the organization after Lovelace.\nWales devoted a large portion of his speech to Wikipedia's footprint in Africa. Wikipedia is currently offered in 285 languages and of African languages, , , and are the largest. Wales described how in a one month period in 2011 Yor\u00f9b\u00e1 jumped to first in the number of articles. Yor\u00f9b\u00e1 Wikipedia User:Demmy created a bot that added 15,000 articles to the language in one month and his activity doubled the number of active editors to about four. Wales presented the second annual \"Jimbo Award\" to User:Demmy for his contribution to the Yor\u00f9b\u00e1 language version of Wikipedia.\nWales said the Wikimedia Foundation's mobile initiative would be an important part of bringing people from developing countries to Wikipedia and would even offer new editing tools for the community worldwide.\nNew software is in development that could also expand the number of editors of Wikipedia. Sue Gardner, executive director of the Wikimedia Foundation, announced that Wikimedia Foundation is currently testing its Visual Editor Software that she says will make it as easy to edit Wikipedia as it is to update the status on a person's Facebook account. \"Editing is unnecessarily difficult,\" Gardner said. \"We're using an older technology. And it's an open-source environment and developers of that kind of software are not typically dedicated to design and usability issues\" but to solving technical problems.\nWikimania is an international event and past conferences have been held in Frankfurt, Germany; Boston, USA; , Taiwan; Alexandria, Egypt; Buenos Aires, Argentina; Gda\u0144sk, Poland; and Haifa, Israel. Next year's Wikimania is to be held in Hong Kong, China.\nThe main conference has attracted over 1,000 participants and will be open through July 14."}

He explained he could walk with difficulty up until age twelve or thirteen, after which he began using a wheelchair. Shortly after this, he began playing wheelchair basketball. He attended a disabilities tournament for children with disabilities in England, where he tried both wheelchair basketball, since he came from a town where team sports were popular; and wheelchair tennis, as he'd played with an able-bodied friend. Ultimately, he chose wheelchair basketball as it was a team sport. \n\"Wikinews\" asked Pollock about being loud towards his team mates during the match on July 20 between the Australian Rollers and the Great Britain Bulldogs. He said he was out of wheelchair basketball for nine months due to a pressure sore and surgery on his shoulder, and has been making a comeback since January, with the doctors and physiotherapists giving him the all-clear in April. On that night, he said, the Australian team used bullying tactics and some of his teammates on the British team didn't step up to win the game. He also said that no matter what team his team plays against, he has a target on his back because of his calibre of playing in the game, and his team failed to to understand it that night, leaving him frustrated with his team and himself; and, he hates coming to Australia during a Paralympic year since the home town \u2014that is, Australian\u2014 referees do not protect the visiting team from the home team's dirty playing, which puts the British team's gold medal prospects in jeopardy.\n\"Wikinews\" also asked Pollock his opinions regarding . Pollock believes Pistorius shouldn't be competing in the Olympics if other Paralympic athletes can't compete. He also mentioned reservations about certain technical aspects, such as whether Pistorius would be the same height if he still had his legs rather then his legs. Asked about playing in wheelchair basketball, he said he believes 5 point players can play with other point players but not in the Paralympics, and said 5 point players currently play in the domestic league but not at the elite level, to boost the number of players participating and to help the development of the game.\n\"Wikinews\" also questioned him about tattoos worn by members of the British team. In previous years, he said, only one or two forwards had tattoos, but now almost everyone has one as having tattoos is currently in fashion. He said he got his first tattoo at the age of sixteen and only recently had it removed. He also has tattoos on his right arm, depicting the logos of the Paralympics and World championships in which he competed.\nPollocks's team begins its London campaign on August 30, against the Germany men's national wheelchair basketball team."}

As a general rule it's a philospohy that divides reality into two parts; Order and Disorder.

If you feel like you're a bad Discordian for challenging or rejecting parts of the philosophy that don't suit you, you're missing the point.

So I'd like to add something to the knowledge base of what we know about Discordianism. Especially in regards to the modern face.\nThere's some works that go into detail about the origins of Discordia, including 'The Prankster and the Conspiracy' by Adam Gorightly which gives a detailed overview of Kerry Thornley who was one of the two founders of Discordia.\nBut there are so many big exciting names in Discordia today whose stories haven't been told in much detail, and I'd like to remedy that.\n\":\" How long do you hope to take on this project?\nBrenton: Possibly a year.

I've already started some interviews with figures such as Professor Cramulus, St Mae, Peterson Silva (Brazilian Discordian who translated the Black Iron Prison text into Portuguese) Gavriel Discordia from the Discordian Culture Shop and others from further out, places like Sweden and Finland.\n\":\" In what form will your project take (book, essay etc)?\nBrenton: It should come out as a book. Hopefully I'll also end up with some footage I can upload as well of the interviews I hold.\n\":\" Where would you upload this footage to?\nBrenton: Youtube. With the permission of interviewees. \n\":\" So you know of any other people working on similar projects?\nBrenton: I know Pope Timothy Bowen who I've already had contact with, worked on something similar with Voices of Chaos, a fantastic collection of interviews with contemporary Discordian figures. In contrast I want to work on a piece that follows a travel narrative structure, and spend some more time interacting with groups of Discordians worldwide.\n\":\" Is there anything else you'd like to add?\nBrenton: I'm self-funding this project. There've been some others out there who've been excited about this project and have said they'd like to help make it happen. So if anyone would like to help out, I do have a Pozible page going on that I'd be super appreciative of you linking to.\n&lt;br&gt;The Pozible page is found at: pozible.com/eris"}

It features original material compiled throughout the previous month after a brief mention of some of the month's biggest stories.\nIn this month's edition on the campaign trail: \"Wikinews\" interviews the Peace and Freedom Party vice presidential nominee, analysts react to the Republican choice for vice president, and \"Wikinews\" updates readers on the candidates who challenged President Barack Obama in the Democratic primaries.\nSummary.\nAugust began with the Obama re-election campaign's continued attacks on presumptive Republican nominee Mitt Romney's decision to not release his tax records from previous years. Democratic Senator Harry Reid alleged that an unnamed investor from Romney's former business advised him Romney had not paid any taxes in the undisclosed years. The Romney campaign rejected the validity of Reid's comments, and Republican Senator Lindsey Graham accused Reid of lying. Thereafter, the Obama campaign began airing a new advertisement that referred to Romney's tax plan as \" in reverse\" or \"Romney Hood\". The Romney campaign countered that it was actually Obama, and not Romney, who wished to increase taxes. Further controversy spawned from the Obama-allied , which ran ads connecting Romney to the cancer death of the wife of a Union leader at . The leader said he lost healthcare coverage after Bain, which had operated the plant for a short period, shut it down. The Romney campaign claimed the shutdown occurred while Romney was running the 2002 Winter Olympics in , and asked the Obama campaign to disavow the ad; however, an Obama spokesman claimed no involvement and refused to denounce the ad. In response, Romney debuted an ad that attacked Obama as someone \"who will say or do anything to stay in power\", arguing he had \"squandered...one of his key attributes...[as] a different kind of politician who was going to take us to a better place.\" The Obama campaign offered to end the ads attacking Romney for his tax records if he released his records from the previous five years; Romney declined. His spokesman argued, \"It is clear that President Obama wants nothing more than to talk about Governor Romney's tax returns instead of the issues that matter to voters\". A \" report from early August suggested Obama's ads were negatively affecting Romney's likability rating and his position in the polls. Nevertheless, analysis of the previous month's receipts showed that despite the attacks, for the third straight month, the Romney campaign raised more money than Obama.\nOn August 11 during an event in front of the in Norfolk, , Romney named Congressman Paul Ryan of Wisconsin as his running mate. After an introduction, Ryan, the chairman of the and author of the budget proposal \", argued the ticket \"won't duck the tough issues \u2014 we will lead.\" In response to the selection, Obama staffers remarked it \"makes clear that Romney would be a rubber stamp for the congressional GOP\" and the choice provides the Obama campaign with \"clear advantages\". Shortly thereafter, Obama's running mate, Vice President Joe Biden, himself made headlines after commenting to a partly African American audience in Virginia, \"in the first 100 days, [Romney's] going to let the big banks write their own rules \u2014 unchain . They\u2019re going to put y\u2019all back in chains.\" Romney cited this as an example of the Obama presidency's \"angry and desperate\" state and called on Obama to \"take your campaign of division and anger and hate back to Chicago\". Biden's were not the only controversial remarks connected with the August campaign. Discussing , Republican Senate candidate and Congressman of Missouri told a local radio program, \"If it's a legitimate rape, the female body has ways to try to shut that whole thing down.\" The comment drew condemnation from Republicans including Romney, who labeled it \"inexcusable\" and asked that Akin step down from the race. Obama described the remarks as \"offensive\" and his campaign attempted to use it to revive the \"\" rhetoric; chairwoman Representative argued, \"Akin\u2019s choice of words isn\u2019t the real issue here. The real issue is a Republican Party \u2014 led by Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan \u2014 whose policies on women and their health are dangerously wrong.\"\nPrior to the Republican National Convention, then- was projected to make landfall near the event in , Florida. Though it eventually made landfall as a near , the first day of the convention was largely cancelled and Louisiana's Governor decided not to attend. Nevertheless, the convention was held. On the first regular day: the Romney-Ryan ticket was officially nominated; though it attracted controversy as most of the Maine delegation walked out of the proceedings as ten of the state's twenty delegates were given to Romney instead of Congressman Ron Paul. Paul had held an event before 10,000 spectators at the 's Sun Dome a day prior to the scheduled start of the convention, where he proclaimed that his continued. After the nomination, nominee's wife and New Jersey Chris Christie addressed the convention in prime time speeches. The next day, former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and governor spoke to the delegates before Paul Ryan officially accepted the vice presidential nomination in a speech that notably included the line, \"College graduates should not have to live out their 20s in their childhood bedrooms, staring up at fading Obama posters and wondering when they can move out and get going with life.\" On the final day of the convention, actor and former , California Mayor Clint Eastwood made a surprise appearance and delivered an impromptu speech, which included an interview of a chair representing Obama, emphasizing his unmet promises as president. After addressing attendees, Senator Marco Rubio of Florida introduced Romney, who took the stage and formally accepted the Republican Party presidential nomination. In his speech, Romney discussed his family, recalled some personal anecdotes, and criticized Obama, arguing the \"centerpiece of the president\u2019s entire re-election campaign is attacking success.\" Addressing Obama supporters, Romney agreed \"hope and change had a powerful appeal\" but asked, \"If you felt that excitement when you voted for Barack Obama, shouldn\u2019t you feel that way now that he\u2019s President Obama? You know there\u2019s something wrong with the kind of job he\u2019s done as president when the best feeling you had was the day you voted for him.\" In response to the convention, Obama remarked, \"what they offered over those three days was more often than not an agenda better suited for the last century. ... We might as well have watched it on a black-and-white TV.\" Early polling analysis showed the convention improved Romney's likability ratings, and in the national average for August 31, Romney edged closer with 45.9 percent support, behind Obama's 46.4 percent. \nPeace and Freedom Party VP nominee speaks to Wikinews.\nIn August, comedienne , star of the popular '90s sitcom \"\", won the presidential nomination of the left-wing Peace and Freedom Party. She named peace activist Cindy Sheehan as her running mate. \"Wikinews\" reached out to Sheehan to discuss the campaign. \nSheehan is best known for her active opposition to the War in Iraq following the loss of her son Casey there in 2004. In protest of the war, she set up camp outside President George W. Bush's ranch in , Texas, demanding a pullout of U.S. troops and prosecution of Bush administration officials for war crimes. According to her website, Sheehan also advocates , believing it to be key to loosening the \"Imperialist/Capitalist two-party stranglehold\" on U.S. and world politics.\nThis campaign is not Sheehan's first foray into electoral politics. In , she challenged then-House Nancy Pelosi for Congress as the nominee of the Green Party, finishing second in a field of seven candidates. During the campaign, she championed the reduction of U.S. troops abroad, and endorsed , bank , , education subsidies, , alternative fuels, and electoral reform.\nNow, as the Peace and Freedom Party vice presidential nominee, Sheehan campaigns on a similar platform that promotes socialism, , and . Thus far, the party has attained ballot access in California, , and Florida.\nWith \"Wikinews\", Sheehan reveals her reason for joining Roseanne, discusses her responsibilities as the vice presidential nominee, and details what she personally contributes to the ticket.\nWhy did you agree to be the running mate of Roseanne Barr?\nWhat are your responsibilities in this position?\nHow do you complement Roseanne on the ticket?\nAnalysts react to Republican VP selection.\nAfter Mitt Romney's selection of Congressman Paul Ryan as his running mate, \"Wikinews\" tracked down two political analysts who had previously offered their insights on possible Republican Party vice presidential picks. \nIn March, Dan Judy of North Star Opinion Research discussed the possibility that would receive the vice presidential nomination, and in June, examined the prospect of Senator of . Judy did not believe either had a realistic chance of winning the nomination, and with Romney's pick, his expectation proved correct. Though both Paul and Fortu\u00f1o delivered prime time speeches at the Republican National Convention, neither did so as the vice presidential nominee; that was reserved for Ryan.\nJudy sees the selection of Ryan as a positive for the Romney campaign. He feels that as \"one of the few serious policy thinkers in either party\", Ryan will shift the campaign into \"a more serious, solutions-oriented campaign that will make President Obama's campaign, which has focused almost solely on personal attacks against Mitt Romney, look petty and small.\" Moreover, he believes Ryan can help Romney win in the swing state of Wisconsin, which no Republican presidential candidate has won since President Ronald Reagan was re-elected in .\nKyle Kondik of \"\", who in June also rejected the idea of a Rand Paul ticket, differs from Judy somewhat in his assessment of the Ryan pick. He agrees that the selection will raise policy issues, particularly entitlement reform, but questions whether that will help or hurt Romney. He believes the announcement itself was poorly planned since it occurred on a Saturday morning in August during the , and that it initially did not lead to a poll boost for Romney. Nevertheless, Kondik argues, \"the running mates for either candidate are not vitally important; this [election] is about Obama and Romney.\"\nUpdate on 2012 Democratic candidates.\nWith the looming, \"Wikinews\" decided to update on some of the candidates who challenged President Barack Obama during the Democratic primaries earlier this year. Of the three candidates chronicled: one is actively continuing his presidential campaign, one is backing a third party ticket, and another recently encountered a major roadblock to his goal of preventing Obama's unanimous nomination. \nAnti-abortion activist Randall Terry of West Virginia, who received 22,734 votes in the Democratic primaries overall and who, after a strong second-place showing in the primary, qualified for delegates that the state party later denied, has been waging an independent campaign in several states to appear on the November ballot. According to Terry, he has ballot access in West Virginia, and has attained official write-in status in Colorado. Currently, he is petitioning to appear on the Kentucky and Nebraska ballots, and is hoping to be certified as a write-in candidate in Virginia, Iowa, Indiana, and Pennsylvania.\nHistorian Darcy Richardson of Florida, who garnered 41,730 votes in the primaries, decided afterwards to seek the nomination of the Reform Party of the United States, but dropped his bid late in July due to the party's lack of ballot access. Fitness model Andre Barnett ultimately won the Reform Party nomination in August. Richardson says that he is now supporting the Peace and Freedom Party presidential ticket of Roseanne Barr and Cindy Sheehan, and is helping to organize the party's chapter in Florida, where it recently gained ballot access.\nAttorney John Wolfe, Jr. of Tennessee, who won 117,033 votes, more than any other challenger, and who qualified for delegates in Louisiana and , which the state parties refused to recognize, has pursued lawsuits against the parties, hoping to have his delegates seated at the Democratic National Convention to prevent the unanimous renomination of President Obama. However, on August 30, a federal district court threw out his suit against the Arkansas party, arguing that the stripping of delegates, for failing to properly file for the delegates, did not violate Wolfe's constitutional rights. Nevertheless, Wolfe argued that the refusal to grant delegates to him amounted to a disfranchisement of the 42 percent of Arkansas Democrats that voted for him in the primary.\nWhen asked if he planned to attend the Democratic National Convention, Wolfe did not immediately respond. The convention is to be held September 4\u20136 in , ."}

Athletes from around the world bring in all manner of equipment.\nThe prosthetic technicians have to deal with everything from flat tyres to broken spokes to full-scale rebuilds. They have to be expert problem solvers. They frequently collaborate on determining how best to effect a repair. The objective is to get the wheelchair repaired and back in service as soon as possible.\nWheelchairs vary somewhat in design, depending on the sport. Those for and have wheels so they can spin around. and parts are used for strength. Ottobrock has a welding workshop where frames are repaired; the teams' equipment managers understandably cannot bring such heavy equipment with them to the games, so they rely on the workshops. When a repair job is required, it is often required in a hurry. At the Turkey vs United States game, a chair was repaired during the match.\nIn addition to wheelchairs, the workshops handle all manner of work with prostheses. Carbon fibre running blades are adjusted. Broken feet and legs are a challenge. The Chinese team brought in its power chairs to have the electronics adjusted. In that sport, having the controls working perfectly is all-important.\nThere are 4,200 athletes at the Paralympic games. So far, the workshops have carried out 1,100 repairs."}

One, Fijian high-jumper Iliesa Delana, missed out in Beijing due to his event being cancelled. He is currently ranked number two in the world, having won silver at the World Championships. The other is Francis Kompaon, a sprinter from in Papua-New Guinea competing in the 100 and 200 metre sprints. These athletes qualified under the standard Paralympic processes. Other Oceania athletes are \"wildcards\", selected by the (IPC) to broaden the number of nations taking part. Countries do not always get their preferred choices of wildcards; for a variety of reasons, the IPC may select a less-favoured athlete. In particular, women are more likely to be chosen to address the games' gender imbalance.\nIt's not easy being an athlete, or an official, from a developing country says Bird. Often people are confronted with a host of unfamiliar situations. For example: many of the required forms are now online; officials with little technology experience have to navigate an unfamiliar landscape of browsers, buttons and passwords.\nThe OPC consists of eight countries: Australia, New Zealand, Fiji, Samoa, Tonga, Vanuatu, the Solomon Islands, and Papua-New Guinea. Papua-New Guinea and Samoa are sending two athletes each to the London Games. Fiji, Tonga, Vanuatu, and the Solomon Islands are sending one each. \nBird says, in attempting to promote Paralympic sport in Oceania, the region's Paralympic Committee puts a priority on training local officials, coaches and classifiers. This helps member countries conduct their own events, without assistance from Australia and New Zealand. Additionally, the Committee organizes the Arafura Games, a regional competition.\nCountries in the region are encouraged by the OPC to assemble teams, get athletes into work rankings, and plan ahead for the 2016 Paralympics to be held in . Efforts are being made to strengthened ties between the region and international bodies such as the International Tennis Federation.\nBird, as head of the OPC, has been a member of the since 1993. He won gold and silver medals in swimming at the 1984 Paralympics where he was the Australian Team Captain. He was the Australian Chef de Mission in in 2000 and in 2004, and the Assistant Chef de Mission in in 1992, in 1996, and Beijing in 2008.

The probe found two marines died after the pilots lost control in a tailwind in Morocco.\nThe accident has triggered attention from Japanese media ahead of a planned deployment there, and officials at a press conference Friday were keen to stress no mechanical or structural defects were found. The pilots had opted for an unplanned 180-degree turn to avoid flying low over obstructions including people and vehicles. This move placed them into a strong tailwind.\nThis wind tilted the plane forward, but the pilots did not realise and began rolling the engines forward. The Osprey had been flying in helicopter mode, with the rotors pointed skywards; by pointing them forwards, it can be operated as a standard aircraft. Normal flight rules call for the aircraft being level, not tilted, when this switch is made.\nThese actions moved the forward, which pitched the nose further down. Pulling on the flight column was insufficient to correct the problem, and the aircraft flew down into the ground. Two Marines in the back were killed, and both pilots were seriously injured. The investigation suggested leaving the aircraft in helicopter mode could have prevented the accident.\nThe wounded pilots are still recovering, and Marine Corps Aviation's deputy commandant Lt. Gen. Robert Schmidle said that when they are well enough they will go before a panel to determine if they are fit to fly. He says their actions will be scrutinised then.

Brazil won 1\u20130, topping Group B.\nBoth teams came into the game with similar records. Each had one win and a draw, and were tied on goal difference. A win would see them through to the finals. In case of a draw, the two sides would be reduced to drawing lots.\nBrazil won gold in 5-a-side football at both past Paralympic Games where it was included \u2014 Athens , and Beijing in 2008 where they defeated China 2\u20131 in the final. China won silver in Beijing even though they had no national team prior to hosting the Games there.\nThere were about 150 people in the crowd at the Riverbank Arena when the game began, although this swelled to over 500 after half time. The weather was sunny and warm. There were a number of flags on display in the crowd, including the flags of Brazil, Turkey and France, and the ubiquitous Union Flag.\nThe two teams had different rituals when their national anthems were played. The Brazilians had their hands over their hearts, whereas the Chinese stood at attention and sang while theirs was played. Most startlingly, they threw their hands up in the air and shouted at the end. \nFive-a-side football players wear blindfolds to insure a level playing field, as some blind people are more blind than others. However, the goalkeepers are sighted, and, like the goalkeepers in regular football, can use their hands. When ball is in play, spectators are asked to be keep silent so the players can hear the ball, which has bells in it. It was quite loud, and audible from the bleachers. It is also heavier than a regular football. There are three guides for each team who tell players where the ball is. \nThe blue artificial surface \u2014 the same used for the hockey during the Olympics \u2014 could be slippery at times. Occasionally the players would run into each other or the goal post. At one point, the Brazilian goalkeeper stopped the ball with his crotch, which caused his to fall to the ground writing in pain. The umpire cautioned him at one point but never produced any coloured cards.\nThe playing field is smaller than a regular football pitch, and the goal is small. The pitch has walls on the sides that help to rebound the sound and the ball itself. Bouncing the ball of the side is a standard tactic. The rules are fairly similar to eleven-a-side football. The game consists of two 25 minute halves with a 10 minute break between halves. There is no off-side rule.\nBoth sides played defensively, with three players back and one forward, so there was little passing but a lot of foot skill. In earlier games they played with two forward and two back. As a rule, the Brazilians favoured a more open style of play. The game was fairly even early on. Brazil had a couple of good shots at goal that the Chinese goal keeper was lucky to stop. China's Wang Zhoubin also had a shot at goal that bounced off the goal post with a resounding noise.\nAbout 21 minutes in, Brazil's Jeferson da Conceicai Goncalves scored the first goal. His teammates jumped all over field, and guides walked the players to the team celebration. \nAfter half time, the defensive game continued, although Brazil started sending another player forward. Chinese attacks tended to still be from a single player. Shortly after halftime, a mix up saw two Brazilian defenders compete for the ball, and they nearly scored an own goal. Wang then made a spectacular shot which missed the goal. \nAs the second half wore on, China switched to a two-forward formation. Li Xiaoqiang and Wang pressed a series of attacks, which garnered a lot of ooohs from the crowd but nothing on the scoreboard. Meanwhile, Brazil continued aggressively, with Marcos Jose Alves Felipe in particular looking threatening. \nThe Brazilian contingent in the crowd roared loudly at the final siren. Asked how he felt to have made the semifinals, Brazil Coach Ramon Pereira de Souza said: \"I have no words. My happiness is shaped on all the faces of the players and coaches in the team. It was a difficult game. It is the passage to the next stage. Facing China is not like facing any other team. China has spectacular players.\""}

Seconds later, Cobo Crispin had a shot from the paint, but missed; Kylie Gauci then finally put points on the scoreboard for the Gliders.\nMexico turned the ball over, and Cobi Crispin got her first from the paint, assisted by Kylie Gauci. This was repeated on the next play, with Sarah Stewart providing the assist. Mexico then scored, the Gliders responding with another shot from Cobi Crispin. On the next play, Kylie Gauci stole the ball and charged down the court, but failed to make the shot. Clare Nott took a defensive rebound, leading to Cobi Crispin scoring again. She was also fouled. but missed the resulting free throw. Shortly thereafter, Sarah Stewart took another foul, and made both shots to bring the score to 14 points to 4. \nMexico had great difficulty moving the ball up the court; suffering by timing out, or being forced into long shots that missed. But, when the same happened to the Gliders, Kylie Gauci, a two-point player, took a spectacular three point shot to take the score to 17 points to 8 in Australia's favour. Mexico then managed to score again before came on with only three minutes left in the quarter, and missed her first shot at goal. A second attempt, coming from a pass by Kylie Gauci, put more points on the scoreboard.\nWith only a few seconds remaining in the quarter, Kylie Gauci stole the ball and delivered it to , who scored again. The two teams went into the quarter-time break with the score 21 points to 10.\nIn the opening minutes of the second quarter, Shelley Chaplin assisted Cobi Crispin, and then Amber Merritt, to add another four points. Attempting to respond, Mexico missed two shots before scoring then, on the next play, allowed to steal the ball, which led to Amber Merritt scoring again.\nAustralia followed this up with steals by Cobi Crispin and Amber Merritt, giving Shelley Chaplin more scoring opportunities. Mexico scored twice; but, Australia responded each time, with goals by Amber Merritt and Amanda Carter, who was fouled, making her's a three-point play. A steal led to a runaway break by Amber Merritt, bringing her contribution to ten points, and the score to 38 points to 16.\nMexico seemed unable to shake a pattern of turnovers and hasty shots, resulting in a 44 to 20 points difference at the half-time break. \nIn the third quarter, the Glider's intensity dropped off; A timeout, and a series of missed shots by Katie Hill, Brodie Kean and Cobi Crispin, gave Mexico a chance to stage a minor recovery by outscoring Australia for the quarter by one point, leaving the score at 50 to 27 at the end of the third quarter.\nThe final quarter got off to an unimpressive start for both teams; Australia's missed a shot at one end, and Mexico's Floralia Estrada Bernal missed one at the the other. Sarah Stewart missed too before a Mexican turnover led to the first scoring of the quarter, by Sarah Stewart. Mexico's Rocio Torres Lopez scored in response, another shot by Sarah Stewart missed; but, Amanda Carter took an offensive rebound, which eventually made it into the basket. Turnovers by Bridie Kean and Leanne del Toso led Mexico putting points on the board consecutively, but successive fouls sent Bridie Kean to the free throw line to score three points. \nAmber Merritt brought the score to 59 points to 35 with her seventh scoring shot. By this point, Australia was deliberately running down the clock, passing the ball around, and taking shots at the last minute. This led to several missed shots by Sarah Vinci and Katie Hill, with Mexico unable to capitalise on the opportunities. Under intense Australian defensive pressure, Mexico missed shots and turned over the ball as-often as before. With nineteen seconds of play remaining, Katie Hill took a two point shot from inside the paint; attracting a foul, she scored another point from a free throw.\nAlthough Mexico's Wendy Garcia Amador scored the last two points of the game, the final score of 62 points to 37 meant the Mexican team's Paralympic campaign was over.\nAustralia must now confront the winner of tonight's versus game on Thursday.

The crowd included the familiar block of Gliders fans in yellow T-shirts. They made their presence felt, chanting \"Defence, Gliders, Defence!\" whenever USA had the ball. Unfortunately, the Gliders' poor shooting prevented them from fully capitalising on their superb defence, leaving the score tied at 26\u201326 at half time. \nIn the third quarter, an early goal by Kylie Gauchi from outside the paint gave the Gliders the lead. A series of steals gave the Gliders additional shots at goal, most of which missed, but USA had no answer to the Australian defence, with a series of timeouts and turnovers, and their shooting was even poorer. While the Australians relentlessly racked up point after point, taking a 32\u201326 lead, USA were unable to score at all until the last minute of the quarter. A hurried goal with seconds to go by Katie Hill saw the Gliders leading 38\u201328 at the last change.\nIn the fourth quarter, the Australian defence remained taut, but the shooting remained terrible. In the final accounting, Cobi Crispin only made 3 out of 10 shots, and only 4 out of 16. The Glider's most accurate shot turned out to be Clare Nott, who made four out of five attempts. Meanwhile, an increasingly desperate USA team pegged the Australians back to 40\u201339. Three timeouts were taken in the last minute. Fouls saw Merritt sent to the free throw line, but she missed both shots. The game went down to the last second, with USA missing a shot from inside the paint, before the shot clock ran out. "}

It features original material compiled throughout the previous month after a brief mention of some of the month's biggest stories.\nIn this month's edition on the campaign trail: \"Wikinews\" chronicles three of the lesser-known speakers at the , a controversial pastor and write-in candidate talks to \"Wikinews\" about the unrest in the Middle East, and the ballot-qualified (A3P) presidential nominee travels to Iran to meet President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.\nSummary.\nSeptember opened with the 2012 Democratic National Convention in , North Carolina. On the convention's first night, delivered the keynote address, the first to do so. He discussed the communitarian spirit of the United States and reflected on how his mother \"fought hard for civil rights so that instead of a mop, I could hold this microphone.\" The speech was compared to Barack Obama's at the , and garnered speculation that he would seek higher political office. First Lady Michelle Obama also spoke that night, discussing her husband on a personal level. On the second day, a ruckus ensued as Democrats moved to re-include \"God\" and support of Jerusalem as the Israeli capital in the party's official platform after removal of the items drew criticism leading up to the convention. That night, women's health advocate Sandra Fluke and Massachusetts U.S. Senate candidate Elizabeth Warren each spoke before former President Bill Clinton took the stage to deliver a lengthy, policy-filled speech. In it, Clinton defended Obama's economic policies, arguing that no previous president, including himself, could have fostered complete recovery this soon in the same economic climate. He concluded that the election was ultimately a choice between the \"winner-take-all, you're-on-your-own society\" of the Republicans and the \"we're-all-in-this-together society\" of Obama. On the final night, Vice president Joe Biden spoke before President Obama addressed the convention to officially accept the party's nomination. In his acceptance speech, Obama asked voters to allow his administration to \"finish what we started\", arguing \"it will take more than a few years for us to solve challenges that have built up over decades\" and Republicans offer only policies that have previously failed. \nForeign policy emerged as a major campaign issue after the U.S. embassies in Egypt and Libya came under attack on September 11, resulting in the deaths of four Americans including the . Allegedly, the attacks were the result of protests against a YouTube video trailer for the anti-Islamic film \"\", which the Obama administration condemned in the aftermath of the attacks. Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney criticized President Obama for the response, arguing he \"was wrong to stand by a statement sympathizing with those who had breached our embassy in Egypt, instead of condemning their actions.\" An Obama spokesman expressed \"shock\" at Romney's response, accusing him of \"launch[ing] a political attack\". Shortly thereafter, Romney also criticized Obama for being unable to find time to meet with Benjamin Netanyahu. Obama then had an hour-long phone conversation with Netanyahu. Later in the month, Netanyahu appeared before the United Nations General Assembly with a cartoon of a bomb, voiced his concerns that Iran would attain enough to make a bomb by the summer of 2013, and called on the world to act. Obama and Romney each spoke with Netanyahu. Each candidate expressed similar sentiment in favor of further sanctions against Iran. \nIn mid-September, Romney received negative publicity after the magazine ' released a video of a fundraiser at which Romney alleged, \"there are 47 percent of the people who will vote for the president no matter what ... [because they] are dependent upon government\". He then said his \"job is not to worry about those people. I'll never convince them they should take personal responsibility and care for their lives.\" Romney's running mate Paul Ryan distanced himself from the remarks, which he labeled as \"inelegant\". Obama remarked in response, \"We don't want an inside job in Washington, we want change in Washington...It can't happen if you write off half the nation before you even took office.\" The Romney campaign hoped to shift focus from the video to newly-emerged 1998 footage of Obama in which he advocates redistribution of wealth. Additionally, Romney released his 2011 tax returns, as promised earlier in the year. The returns showed he paid $1.95 million out of the $13.7 million he earned on investments. However, less positive news continued for the campaign as September came to a close. Paul Ryan received boos while discussing the proposed repeal of Obamacare during a speech before an forum, which President Obama also addressed. Plus, Obama increased his lead in the polls with ' showing a six point Obama advantage, 50 percent to 44 percent in a September 26 poll, up from the 46 percent to 46 percent tie prior to the publication of the Romney video. \nNevertheless, Obama was not the only candidate rising in the polls at the end of September. Libertarian Party presidential nominee Gary Johnson, the former of New Mexico, rose to six percent support in a late September Reason-Rupe poll, up from the 4.3 percent showing earlier in a JZ Analytics poll. The Johnson campaign also increased activity. With the looming, the campaign filed suit against the , alleging practices for denying access to third party candidates. With many polls still excluding Johnson at the end of September, Obama led Romney 48.7 to 44.6 in the September 30 polling average.\nLesser-known DNC speakers discuss their experience.\nWhile San Antonio Mayor Julian Castro, women's health advocate Sandra Fluke, and Law professor Elizabeth Warren all formally introduced themselves to the national audience at the 2012 , they were not the only figures to do so. Small business owner Bill Butcher, firefighter Doug Stern, and mother Stacey Lihn were among the \"everyday people\" the party invited to address the convention and the nation. \"Wikinews\" reached out to these three to learn more about their DNC experience and the process of the convention.\nButcher, owner of Port City Brewing in Alexandria, Virginia, says he received the invitation after the Democratic Party found him online while searching for someone who had started a small business during the administration and benefited from its policies. Butcher was able to establish Port City Brewing after obtaining a loan through the , part of the 2009 (The Stimulus).\nIn preparation for his speech, Butcher worked with Obama speechwriters and rehearsed the morning before. Though he admits to being nervous, he discovered that fellow speakers backstage felt similarly. To break the ice, Butcher opened his speech with a joke, apologizing to the audience for not handing out free beer. He then turned to policy, defending Obama as \"a president who's on my side ... [who has] kept middle class taxes low...[and] has fought for small-business owners\". According to Butcher, the speech was received positively, even among his Republican friends, who felt it \"cool\" that their buddy had addressed the DNC. \nLike Butcher, Stern, a firefighter and member of the (IAFF), also received bipartisan praise for his speech. As a union advocate for the repeal of , which limited the rights of Ohio's public employees, Stern feels the party selected him due to his visibility. Because he received word of the invitation just days before the event, Stern did not have much time to prepare. Rather, he viewed YouTube videos of Presidents Obama, Clinton, and Ronald Reagan to find the right style for delivery. Nevertheless, according to Stern, the best input came from his twelve-year-old son, who advised him that delivering a DNC speech was not such a big deal, since \"you give speeches all the time.\"\nIn the speech, Stern introduced himself as a former Republican, but held that as a member of the middle class and as a public employee, the \"party left people like me.\" He applauded the Obama administration for continuing federal grants to fire fighters, and characterized Obama as someone who \"respects middle-class workers like me and my family.\"\nFellow fire fighters, including those of different political stripes, commended Stern on his remarks, and about a week after the speech, Stern met President Obama in , where he received congratulations. Despite the recognition from his peers and presidential praise, the reception of Stern's son was paramount. While watching a line from the speech replayed on \"\", the 12-year-old admitted to his father that despite his previous comments, speaking at the DNC was \"pretty cool.\"\nSimilarly, for Lihn, the night held a special significance due to her family. Lihn, a mother of two daughters one of whom, Zoe, suffers from a congenital heart defect, previously worked with the Obama campaign in March to produce a video documenting how the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) had helped her family pay for her daughter's medical expenses. Looking for someone to discuss health care reform at the convention, the video's producer called Lihn and invited her to speak. \nLike Butcher, she rehearsed her speech in the morning prior, finding this to be more emotional than the actual delivery itself. In the heartfelt speech delivered with her husband and daughter onstage, Lihn articulated her appreciation of Obamacare and the fear that the election of Mitt Romney and possible repeal of Obamacare would prevent needed care for her daughter. After the speech, Lihn embraced First Lady Michelle Obama in what she fondly recalls as \"a genuine hug \u2014 mother to mother.\" Others appreciated the speech as well. Ed Pilkington of \"The Guardian\" wrote that it was not only \"one of the most moving moments of the Democratic national convention ... [but] possibly of the entire 2012 presidential race\". \nFor Lihn, despite the acclaim, she was simply speaking as one of many: \"Our story is but one of thousands and I knew that, standing up on stage speaking, that I was speaking for all of the parents who've walked in my shoes. I felt the strength of the many babies born with Zoe's heart condition who weren't as fortunate as she and passed away before the age of two. I support the ACA [Affordable Care Act] and will continue to do so for those whose voices cannot be heard.\"\n\"Wikinews\" interviews write-in candidate connected to Middle East turmoil.\n\"Wikinews\" caught up with of Gainesville, Florida. Jones, a write-in candidate for president, is best known for his anti-Islamic activism, which has sparked protests across the Muslim world.\nJones first gained notice in 2010, after threatening to burn a Koran at on the ninth anniversary of the 9/11 attacks}. The announcement prompted protests in the Middle East, causing President Obama to request that Jones not partake in the activity. He obliged, but later burned a Koran in March 2011, leading to violent protests in Afghanistan including an on the in , which killed at least 30 people.\nRecently, Jones has received mention for promoting the film \"Innocence of Muslims\", whose trailer allegedly inflamed riots in Egypt and Libya on September 11 due to its portrayal of . During the riots, the American embassies in the two nations were breached, leading to the deaths of four Americans in Libya, including U.S. Ambassador Christopher Stevens. Jones told \"\" he had remained in contact with the film's director , who was jailed September 28 on charges of violating probation. Jones's involvement with the film has led to warrants for his arrest in Egypt, where authorities want to try him for insults to Islam, spreading lies, and harming national unity. Death is a possible penalty for such offenses. Nevertheless, Jones holds that Egypt \"would definitely be better advised to put Muhammad on trial.\"\nWith \"Wikinews\", Jones discusses ballot access, the \"Innocence of Muslims\", and how he would handle the riots in Egypt and Libya as president.\nIn which states have you attempted to gain ballot access?\nWhat are your thoughts on the film trailer for the movie \"Innocence of Muslims\"? Should the filmmaker bear any responsibility for the anti-American protests across the Muslim world?\nWhat is your response to President Obama's reaction to the protests and attacks on the U.S. embassies? Was Governor Romney's criticism of that reaction appropriate? If you were president, how would you respond to the events?\nA3P nominee meets with the President of Iran.\nFilmmaker , the presidential nominee of the American Third Position Party (A3P), attended a film festival in Tehran, Iran early in September, during which he spoke to an audience that included Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. After the speech, Ahmadinejad invited Miller to a private meeting, which lasted about twenty minutes. This was the first time a U.S. presidential candidate met with Ahmadinejad, a controversial figure who has called for the dissolution of Israel, questioned the validity of the Holocaust, and spurred , which the U.S. and Israel allege is not for peaceful purposes.\nIn contrast to such allegations, Miller tells \"Wikinews\" that his impression of Ahmadinejad was as \"a humble man who deeply cares about promoting truths and the best for his people \u2014 including peace.\" During the meeting, he gave Ahmadinejad a copy of his 2001 film \"\" and his book \"Our Vision for America\". According to Miller, Ahmadinejad wanted it to be communicated to the American people that \" and falsely portray Iran, as they seek conflict between nations\" and that Iran actually desires peace. Miller says that though Ahmadinejad probably did not know much about the specific A3P presidential campaign and platform, he was \"aware of the how Zionist interests control our two major political parties\" and \"was intrigued that alternative voices in America are starting to challenge the injustices of our current political system and the propaganda of our .\"\nThe A3P, which was founded in 2010, is among those \"alternative voices\". Its program calls for a tougher approach to crime, , higher education standards, environmentalism, strengthening of the family unit, a non-interventionist foreign policy, opposition to \"third world\" immigration, border security, and preservation of \"white identity\".\nCritics such as the accuse the A3P of being a white supremacist organization, a charge that Miller denies. Miller appeared on Iran's , and discussed the use of the term on his Wikipedia profile, which he claimed to have unsuccessfully attempted to change. He argued that the label likely stemmed from his \", of Jewish control of [the U.S.] media, [and] of [the U.S.] foreign policy, which is Israel first\".\nMiller and the A3P have attained ballot access in Tennessee, New Jersey, and Colorado, and have additionally qualified for write-in status in Maryland and West Virginia."}

This changed following the first presidential debate, which opinion polls and commentators declared as a Romney victory. Around 67 million Americans watched the -moderated debate, which focused on economic matters. analysis described the debate as possibly the best night of the , finding him in control of the discourse and appearing \"reasonable, pragmatic and respectful.\" On the other hand, the analysis characterized Obama as cautious, lacking energy, and exercising poor body language, particularly in his propensity to look down at his podium while Romney spoke. One memorable exchange occurred when Romney argued that he would cut federal funding to Lehrer's network , prefacing that he actually liked Lehrer, the network, and its ' character , but argued that he would not continue \"to borrow money from China to pay for it.\" Afterwards, Romney experienced a bounce in the national polls, surpassing Obama for the lead in several. Shortly after the debate, September's economic report was released, revealing a fall in unemployment to 7.8 percent, the lowest rate since the beginning of the Obama presidency. However, the Obama campaign hit a potential stumbling block as officials reported details on the in , Libya that led to the deaths of four Americans including Ambassador . The administration had earlier claimed the attacks resulted from ' protests, but it emerged the attacks were planned. The report raised questions of what the administration knew and why better protection was not provided to the consulate. The story broke just shy of the one and only Debate between Vice President Joe Biden and Republican Vice Presidential nominee , held in . Though analysts drew contrasting conclusions on who won the debate with many believing Biden had won it on substance, much post-debate discussion focused on Biden's aggression, use of the word \"malarkey\", incessant smiling and laughing, and interruptions of both Ryan and the moderator of .\nShortly thereafter, the second presidential debate commenced in , moderated by 's . The debate's format allowed the candidates to walk around the stage as they answered pre-selected questions from audience members. In contrast to the first debate, Obama appeared energetic and aggressive, as did Romney. CBS News described the debate as \"contentious\" with Obama and Romney attacking each other often and appearing to almost \"come to blows\" on one exchange. One such exchange occurred when Romney and Obama went back-and-forth about oil leases on federal lands. Obama claimed oil production increased during his administration; Romney agreed but countered that the increase was due only to private production, and that oil leases and production on federal lands actually decreased. The Benghazi attack presented another contentious topic at the debate with Obama claiming that he labeled the incident as a terrorist attack on the day after it happened, which Crowley confirmed, though she also noted the administration later claimed the incident was a reaction to the \"Innocence of Muslims\". Before the next debate, the candidates appeared jointly at a less serious event, each taking part in the traditional hosted by the , where they joked about the election, their opponent, and themselves. The final debate held at Florida's and hosted by CBS News' focused on foreign affairs, which the candidates often appeared to agree on. Notably, Romney avoided criticism of the president for his handling of the September 11 Benghazi attack. One disagreement between the candidates concerned the issue of military strength. Romney accused Obama of proposing budget cuts for the military and criticized him for maintaining a Navy with the fewest battleships since 1917. Obama countered that \"we also have fewer horses and bayonets. Because the nature of the military has changed. We have these things called aircraft carriers, where planes land on them. We have these ships that go underwater, nuclear submarines.\"\nThe next day, four third party candidates excluded from the national debates for not meeting the ' polling threshold, but who satisfied the commission's ballot access requirements, took part in a debate of their own sponsored by the and broadcast on with as the moderator. Those taking part in the debate included former New Mexico and Libertarian Party presidential nominee Gary Johnson, former and Constitution Party nominee Virgil Goode, former and Justice Party nominee Rocky Anderson, and physician , presidential nominee of the Green Party. The two candidates that received the highest number of votes following the event, Johnson and Stein, were then invited to a one-on-one-debate scheduled for the next week. The event was postponed due to the Superstorm . Sandy hit the northeast coast on the final week of campaigning, causing damages largely in New York, New Jersey, and . The destruction and lack of electricity in certain areas raised questions of how the election could take place on November 6 amid such chaos. Furthermore, analysts questioned whether Obama's response to the crisis would help him win the race. As Election Day neared, Obama secured critical endorsements from former and New York City . Nevertheless, in the \"\" average for October 31, Romney and Obama remained in a statistical tie. Polling also indicated that the most critical swing states were Ohio, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Iowa, Colorado, New Hampshire, Florida, Virginia, , , and .\n\"Wikinews\" fan sparks controversy at second presidential debate.\nKerry Ladka, a senior sales associate at Global Telecom Supply and self-professed fan of \"Wikinews\", was one of the individuals picked to address President Barack Obama and Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney at the October 16 presidential debate in Hempstead, New York. His question, which involved the September 11 attack on the U.S. embassy in Benghazi, sparked one of the debate's most contentious and controversial moments.\nAccording to Ladka, randomly selected him to ask a question, which he devised without their assistance. In fact, prior to asking, Ladka explained to viewers that his question arose during a discussion with his friends at work.\nSpeaking directly to President Obama, Ladka mentioned the reports that the U.S. State Department denied additional security forces to the Libyan embassy before it was breached. He then asked, \"Who was it that denied enhanced security and why?\"\nObama responded that upon hearing of the breach, he gave three instructions to his national security advisers: (1) increase security at the Libyan embassy and other U.S. embassies throughout the region; (2) investigate the matter; and (3) find and prosecute the culprits of the attack. He then criticized Romney's reaction to the event as \"trying to make political points.\" Romney responded that it took the administration too long to label the break-in as a terrorist act while casting blame on a YouTube trailer. Obama countered that he actually did refer to the attack as a terrorist act at the on the subsequent day and expressed outrage that Romney would suggest \"anybody on my team would play politics or mislead when we\u2019ve lost four of our own\". This remark led to a war of words between Romney, Obama, and moderator Candy Crowley.\nRomney repeatedly asked Obama whether he actually said the attack was a terrorist act and not a \"spontaneous demonstration.\" Obama twice responded, \"please proceed\" before citing the transcript of his remarks from the Rose Garden. After the moderator confirmed the president's statement, Obama asked her to do so\n\"a little louder\". With Crowley doing so, Romney then argued that the administration instead had maintained the act was a reaction against a video, which Crowley also confirmed. Romney next attempted to question why the \"went on the Sunday television shows and spoke about how this was a spontaneous reaction\", but Crowley decided to move on to other questions.\nLadka told \"\" he did not believe Obama adequately answered the question during the debate, but noted that afterwards, Obama approached him and explained that he had wanted, in the days following the attack, to ensure the intelligence he received on the matter was correct, and that to avoid endangerment he did not want to explicitly name any individual in the State Department responsible for denying security.\nTo the \"Post\", Ladka remained undecided on whom he would give his vote. But now after time for further deliberation, he tells \"Wikinews\" he has come to a decision. Though he felt Romney was \"very impressive\" at the debate, he believes President Obama was the winner and has decided to cast his ballot for the President on Election Day.\nGary Johnson speaks to \"Wikinews\" on Syria and foreign intervention.\nThough the fallout from the break-in at Benghazi was the main foreign policy focus in October, there was also some discussion, especially during the final two-party debate, about the unrest in Syria and actions of the government, which led to the killings of roughly 30,000 people and displacement of 300,000. \nDuring the third and final debate between Obama and Romney, both seemed to agree that the United States should help the anti-government forces in Syria. Gary Johnson, in contrast, has a completely different viewpoint on both Syria and the question of foreign intervention.\nIn an exclusive interview with \"Wikinews\", Johnson asserts that assistance for the Syrian rebels for humanitarian purposes may simply lead to the rise of a faction worse than the regime in power. Broadly speaking, he finds that \"we intervene in the name of humanity, and the result is...more times than not, a situation that is worse, not better.\"\nNevertheless, Johnson does not hold an absolutist view against foreign intervention. When questioned about the need to intervene in the case of a genocide, he responded \"I don\u2019t think any of us want to stand by and watch that happen.\" However, for any kind of military intervention, Johnson favors congressional approval.\nBut for what actually constitutes a genocide requiring intervention, Johnson holds, \"let me borrow from a Supreme Court justice that was asked his definition of pornography. [He said] You know, I can\u2019t give you a definition of pornography but I\u2019d like to think that when I see it I recognize it.\"\nThe complete interview with Governor Johnson on these and other issues can be read here.\nThe final pleas....\nWith Gary Johnson and Jill Stein making their case to voters at the final Free and Equal debate, \"Wikinews\" provided the opportunity to the three other third party presidential candidates with enough ballot access and write-in certification to theoretically win the election.\nThose making their final pleas include: former congressman Virgil Goode, nominee of the Constitution Party; nominee ; and former Salt Lake City Mayor Rocky Anderson, nominee of the Justice Party.\nBallot access maps for each of the three candidates appear below their respective statements.\nVirgil Goode: Virgil Goode is the only candidate who will stop illegal immigration and block automatic citizenship for children born in the US of illegal aliens. He is also the only candidate who will protect jobs for US citizens by stopping so many green card holders from entering the United States. Lastly, he will work to stop the domination by Big Money PACs of federal elections. Save America and Vote for Virgil Goode.\nTom Hoefling: Without faith there can be no justice. The two things are inextricably linked.\nWhat is justice? To put it most simply, it is right-doing. In terms of the law and self-government, it is doing right to all persons equally and equitably. \nBut how can we possibly perfect justice in this country, as the framers of our Constitution purposed to do, if we pay no mind to the laws of nature and of nature's God? It is not possible. \nIs there a desire in your heart to help save this country and restore America's greatness? Then trust God, seek His will, and do right. Join together with your fellow citizens who are of the same mind and heart, and retake the reins of your own self-government. If enough Americans will do this, without compromise, and do it in time, there is hope for this country and for our posterity. We can, if we choose to follow God and do right, once again be a shining city on a hill. \nBut if we refuse, and choose instead to be faithless and unjust by continuing to kill the babies and destroy God's institution of marriage and the natural family, our children and grandchildren, those who survive our brutal savagery, will curse us. They will rightfully convict us of squandering their precious heritage, one that was dearly bought with blood, sweat, and tears by our just and faithful forebears.\nOur generation is a link in the chain between the past and the future. Please, my fellow Americans, I beg you, don't let it be broken. Strengthen the things that remain, before it is too late.\nRocky Anderson: I propose an alternative to the corrupt two-party system that has created a militarist and corporatist government for sale to the highest bidders. My Justice Party campaign calls for people to demand a government that is genuinely of, by, and for the people.\nPeace and prosperity require: (1) aggressive action on climate change; (2) creating a vibrant economy with living wage jobs through a WPA-like initiative, and returning outsourced jobs to the U.S.; (3) a significant reduction in military spending; (4) equal rights, regardless of race, religion, and sexual orientation; (5) a Medicare-for-all system providing better outcomes with lower costs; (6) prosecution of financial crimes, enforcement of financial regulations, including reinstatement of Glass-Steagall; (7) a restorative criminal justice system and an end to the disastrous \u201cwar on drugs\u201d; (8) tax fairness; (9) Social Security and Medicare not be plundered; and (10) dismantlement of the imperial presidency and restoration of the U.S. Constitution.\nMy foreign policy will promote peace and respect for human rights, not the empire-building wars of aggression supported by both major parties. I will promote long-term U.S. security and build better relationships with other nations by ending the immoral drone killings that have already killed hundreds of innocent civilians and created more hatred and hostility toward the U.S."}

It's clear that children are increasingly spending too much time jumping through hoops rather than learning the real skills they need in life.

Saturn on an assortment of economic, foreign, and social issues. In the interview, Johnson makes his final plea to voters before they cast their ballots on Election Day, November 6.\nThough a member of the Libertarian Party in the early 1990s, Johnson was elected and re-elected governor of New Mexico in and as a Republican. During his governorship, he vetoed over 750 bills, more than all other then-governors combined, and left the state with a 1 billion budget surplus. He briefly ran for president as a Republican in 2011 before rejoining the Libertarian Party to seek its 2012 presidential nomination.\nAfter winning the nomination this past May, Johnson has campaigned throughout the nation espousing the , spending cuts across the board, a repeal of , an audit of the , a non-interventionist foreign policy, an end to the Drug War, and legalization of same-sex marriage. He and his running mate, Judge of California, have attained ballot access in all U.S. states except , where he is a write-in candidate, and . Nationally, he has received four percent registered-voter support in the past two CNN/Opinion Research Polls that included him with President Barack Obama, Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney and Green Party nominee . It is the campaign's goal to reach five percent on Election Day, which will enable the party to receive ballot access and federal funding on par with the two major parties.\nWith \"Wikinews\", Johnson discusses the federal budget, education, entitlements, the , , same-sex marriage, the Libertarian Party, and his political future.\nEconomic matters.\nYou also propose decreasing federal education spending including decreases in and loans for college students. Is that correct?\nSo it wouldn't be an immediate cut?\nOkay. I have a question here about entitlements: During the Tea Party Republican Party Debate on September 12, 2011, one of which you were not invited to, [the debate\u2019s moderator], he provided the following scenario to Ron Paul, this is what he said, he said:\n\"A healthy thirty-year-old young man has a good job, makes a good living, but decides, you know what? I'm not going to spend $200 or $300 a month for health insurance because I'm healthy, I don't need it. But something terrible happens, all of a sudden he needs it. Who's going to pay if he goes into a coma?\"\nNow Ron Paul answered that question. If you were at that debate, how would you have responded to that?\nForeign affairs.\nLet's shift to foreign affairs. On your website, you say \"America simply cannot afford to be engaged in foreign policy programs that are not clearly protecting U.S. interests.\" In the case of a humanitarian crisis as in Syria right now, does the U.S. ever have a moral obligation to intervene militarily even if it is not clearly in the U.S. interest?\nLet's say it's like 's Germany, would intervention be necessary then?\nYou were the governor of a border state. As president, what would you do to prevent the violence in Mexico from spilling over into the United States?\nBut as president, would you increase border security or would you keep it the same?\nSocial issues.\nLet's get into social issues now. You criticized President Obama for his stance that same-sex marriage be left to the states. With the in mind, why should same-sex marriage be a federal issue and why should the federal government mandate that states allow same sex marriage?\nLibertarian Party and political future.\nOkay I'm getting to my final questions here. I want to talk about the Libertarian Party. The first nominee of the Party was , who died last year, and he was a supporter of Republican President George W. Bush. The next nominee also left the party and went to the Republican Party. The nominee Ron Paul, as we all know, serves in the House of Representatives as a member of the Republican Party, and his son [] serves in the Senate as a member of the Republican Party. Both the 2008 presidential and vice-presidential nominees of the Libertarian Party: Bob Barr and have recently rejoined the Republican Party and have both endorsed Mitt Romney for president. In fact, until the end of last year, you too were a member of the Republican Party. So why does it seem Libertarians flock to the Republican Party?\nBut you admit that there are some Liberty Republicans and that Republicans make up a large portion of libertarians. Is that correct?\nWell let's say someone is a libertarian-leaning Republican like Rand Paul in the Senate. Should such libertarian Republicans support you and guaranteeing their vote will go to you rather than voting Republican...Let me rephrase this question... Let's say that a Rand Paul Republican was considering who to vote for and they could choose between guaranteeing their vote would not go to the Republican, which they see as the small-government alternative in the duopoly, rather than voting Republican and ensuring their vote will go to someone who they believe is the small government alternative, should they still support you?\nThis is my final question here. The ' website reported last week that your running mate, Judge Jim Gray remarked during an appearance at that you two plan to run again in . Can you confirm whether that is correct?"}

GORD expects the heat waste collecting system to be compatible with any or car.\nGORD chairman Dr Al-Horr summarised the key concepts of the invention in a statement saying, \"Our car produces electricity at no cost by capturing thermal waste energy, reducing costs and eliminating the need for an external source of electricity. Also, bulky compressed-hydrogen cylinders are a thing of the past, as our concept accomplishes the production of hydrogen by using water through fuel cells integrated within the car.\"\nMost of the energy in Qatari vehicle comes from the the car's gasoline tank, supplemented by a thin film photo-voltaic panel on the roof. Normally in a combustion engine, chemical energy stored in a fuel, such as gasoline, is converted into heat energy through combustion. This heat energy is then converted into mechanical energy, manifested as an increase in pressure in the combustion chamber due to the kinetic energy of the combustion gases. The kinetic energy of these combustion gases are then converted into work; because of the inefficiencies in converting chemical energy into useful , internal combustion engines have a theoretical maximum effiecincy of 37% (with what is achievable in day to day applications being about half of this). Of the chemical energy in the consumed fuel used by an internal combustion engine 40% is dissipated as waste heat. However, the Qatari vehicle uses a to convert this waste heat into electricity. Such generators are used in space vehicles, and produce electricity when are subjected to a , the greater the gradient the greater the amount of electrcity produced. In the GORD vehicle the electricity produced is used to potable water to produce hydrogen which can be introduced into the vehicle's existing fuel system.\nThe researchers showed that the heat waste collection engine caused a decrease in the car's emissions, including a decrease of and emissions by more than 50%, the fuel efficiency increasing by 20%. On its website, GORD said that the heat waste collector engine is universal, \"Any car can be adapted to accommodate the system as it doesn't alter any electro-mechanical systems\"."}

This project is important not only to thousands of workers but also to Americans in general,\" added Semmens.\nConstruction on portions of the pipeline were halted in January when the denied permits for it to be finished. \"This announcement is not a judgment on the merits of the pipeline, but the arbitrary nature of a deadline that prevented the State Department from gathering the information necessary to approve the project and protect the American people,\" said President Barack Obama in January.\nThe portion of the pipeline affected by the protesters is part of the 'Gulf Coast Pipeline Project' that is to be about 485 miles long and consist of a \"36-inch crude oil pipeline beginning in , Oklahoma and extending south to , Texas\", says TransCanada on their website."}

I was saying, there's Jessica Gallagher! She was in London! That's so cool!\n But if you're not getting paid to be a sponsor for all that is awesome in Australia, what do you do outside of skiing, and the long jump, and the javelin?\n That's very cool.

The ones who can't see, the ones with no arms, or the ones on a mono-ski?\n Not having arms, you don't think, would be scarier?\n Can you go and tell me your ?\n Like L1...\n So you've all been to Paralympics before?\n And what was your favorite one? Do you have one? \n Because you love ?\n How did the ski slopes compare?\n In Australia, the big visibility Paralympics are the summer. Do you guys ever feel vaguely \u2014 I know it's the wrong question to ask \u2014 but do you ever feel vaguely cheated because you're doing neglected, you don't get the attention, the 's like \"nah, we don't want to cover you\"? \n So you guys like the new point system they implemented?\n at the summer games was talking about the disparity problem between able bodied athletes and athletes with disabilities in terms of sponsorship. You guys have no visibility, is that something that you guys sit there going \"we should have the same sponsorship as the great Australian skiers\"? \n Do you guys get equal treatment? Your share of the same facilities, same trainers, that sort of stuff? \n You mentioned Australia being like a country of summer sports. What attracted you to winter sport in the first place?\n Are there any skiers that you're looking forward to racing against this week coming up? \n So you do not care about the , or whoever, hanging around?\n I feel like we're almost coming to a close. What do you do outside of skiing? You had some life you said.\n What do you do Mitchell?\n Which university?\n You finished your then?\n And you did well?\n And Toby, what are..?\n Thank you very, very much. It was much appreciated. \n Look forward to seeing you guys in Russia!"}

Stoelker of Santa Clara County, California was disqualified from a case on practices the day before Christmas, on a technicality. The case was filed by David and Salma Merritt of Santa Clara County against multiple defendants, including , , and , among others.\nThe Merritts had challenged Judge Stoelker's involvement in the case, claiming many of his rulings had favored his former clients even when law would have indicated otherwise. Some of the defendants are Judge Stoelker's former clients.\nThe events leading to this case began in 2006 when the Merritts accepted a home loan from Countrywide. At that time, Countrywide was advertising 30-year mortgages at between 1 and 3 percent interest. The Merritts received a \"good faith estimate\" consistent with those advertisements. They claim that Countrywide representatives tricked them into signing loan documents that were subsequently altered to appear to commit them to an obligation they had not agreed to. \nA review of similar cases filed by individuals in California found that all had been settled in at most 9 months, usually in favor of the banks. Merritt v. Mozilo has continued in the courts for much longer, celebrating its third anniversary last Saturday. The Merritts' claims are consistent with published statements by , former Executive Vice President of Fraud Risk Management at Countrywide, that fraud was endemic to certain parts of Countrywide. \nTheirs was the only case heard in Department 9 that morning in recognition of Christmas. That hearing was scheduled, because the Sixth District of the (case number H038883) required the to (a) give all parties an opportunity to be heard regarding the possible disqualification of Judge Stoelker and (b) reply to the appellate court by December 26. This appellate ruling was only issued on November 26, and Judge Mark H. Pierce did not schedule the required hearing until December 12. The notice for this hearing required parties to file responses ten days before, which meant that the parties only had two days to prepare their replies. \nOn August 16, the Merritts learned Judge Stoelker had represented defendants in this case on numerous occasions before he was appointed to the bench in December 2010 and had not disclosed this fact to the Merritts. The next day they filed a Verified Statement of Disqualification asking Stoekler to recuse himself. The California Code of Civil Procedure (CCP) 170.3(c)(3) and (4) [confirmed in the 1988 appellate decision in Lewis v. Superior Court] give a judge ten days to respond to to such a motion. Stoelker replied on the eleventh day. \n\"All Rise\" was heard at 9:04 AM local time Monday morning, whereupon Judge Pierce entered the courtroom. Attending by phone were attorneys James Goldberg representing Bank of America and Brian Craft representing First American Title. David Merritt was present representing himself. Goldberg had filed a brief asserting that the Merritts' Verified Statement of Disqualification was served upon Judge Stoelker on August 17 but was not filed, as witnessed by the fact that it was not listed on the docket. Judge Pierce reported that he had checked the files and found that this Statement had indeed been filed, and he didn't know why it was not on the docket. Attorney Goldberg suggested that the fact that the Statement was not on the docket may have contributed to Judge Stoelker's failure to respond within the ten day limit. Judge Pierce replied, \"That's a stretch.\" \nAttorney Craft asked about next steps, since all action in this case had been stayed by the appellate court pending resolution of this issue. Judge Pierce then replied that Judge Manoukian would be handling discovery in this case, replacing Judge Stoelker in that capacity. He further stated that a reply to the appellate court had been prepared concurring with the appellate court's disqualification of Judge Stoelker and asked Mr. Merritt to retrieve that order from the clerk in the courtroom and file it as usual with the clerk's office. He also noted that this action would lift the stay. Other actions in this case could now proceed with the next steps being scheduled January 22, 2013, or later. \nThis is the second appellate reversal of decisions by this superior court in this case. The first reversal came on December 19, 2011, when the appellate court reinstated as a defendant. "}

That potential race is now taking shape with two candidates having emerged as the frontrunners for their respective parties' nominations: Republican Senator and Democratic Representative .\nMassachusetts law adopted in 2004 requires a vacated seat to be filled permanently through special election held 145 to 160 days following vacation. This law was passed purportedly to prevent then-Governor Mitt Romney, a Republican, from naming a replacement for Kerry, who was at the time, the Democratic presidential nominee. No such election occurred until long-time Senator died in office, vacating his seat in 2009. At the time, named Democrat as a temporary replacement. Kirk chose not to run for the seat, and instead the Democrats nominated Massachusetts Attorney General , who lost to Brown. Now, Patrick reportedly wishes to again name a temporary replacement who will not run in the special election. Candidates for this position include: , the widow of Ted Kennedy; former governor and ; and the retiring Congressman .\nAmid the Senate's consideration of the , Brown's 2010 election broke the Democrats' filibuster-proof super-majority in the chamber. As the first Massachusetts Republican elected since in 1972, Brown gained a reputation in the Senate as a political moderate, stressing bipartisanship. However, in the most expensive Senate race in the nation's history in 2012, he lost the seat to the professor , who tied him to Senate Republicans. After the defeat, Republican Senators of Indiana, John McCain of Arizona, and of Maine each asked Brown to run for Senate again. He alluded to a potential return during his farewell address earlier in December, noting, \"As I\u2019ve said many times before, victory and defeat is temporary ... Depending on what happens, and where we go, all of us, we may obviously meet again.\" Though former Governor is also considered a potential Republican primary candidate, Brown leads him in opinion polls by a wide margin. Additionally, a December 17\u201318 poll conducted by shows Brown with a 58 percent favorability rate in his state and ahead of potential Democratic nominees Markey, former Congressman , and Congressmen and .\nPatrick, Kennedy, Coakley, and Meehan have all denied interest in the seat as have other Democrats speculated to jump in including actor and attorney , Ted Kennedy's son. Though Lynch and Capuano have expressed interest in the seat, Markey is thus far the only announced candidate. In a statement to \"\", Markey affirmed \"this fight is too important\" not to run and \"there is so much at stake\" in the election. He added that an official announcement would come in January. Markey, who has served in Congress since 1976, previously ran for the Senate seat in 1984 but withdrew before the primary; Kerry went on to win the primary and seat that year. Markey intends to focus his campaign on , , protection of and , and government spending for jobs. He has secured endorsements from both Kerry and Victoria Kennedy, and with a war chest of 3.1 million from his congressional campaigns, has significantly more funds than any of his potential primary opponents. According to political scientist Peter Ubertaccio of , that may discourage prominent Democrats thinking about entering the race. Nevertheless, State Senator has announced he is exploring a potential bid.\nThough Markey has more money than Brown's $464,000 left from his 2012 campaign, Ubertaccio, in his analysis of the race, notes Brown has more recent campaign experience than Markey, who has not had a competitive campaign lately. Moreover, he finds Markey \"very much a creature of Washington, which can be problematic in a tough statewide race.\" He sees the rush to support Markey as unusual, and as a way to discourage Democratic challengers to Markey.

It has a sort of grace that normal basketball lacks.

You've got the gold... no wait...\n I was sure you'd be saying \"I've already got the silver and the bronze. Give me the gold!\"\n Well, the team's pretty much the same one as in Athens isn't it?\n What I noticed was when I looked over the statistics of basketball over the time you've been playing, the scores have been going up. \n So you are a full time athlete?\n So you got a grant from the government?\n That's pretty intense though. Have you taken a break since then?\n Like what?\n Oh okay.\n Wow!\n When is that?\n Are you still with the basketball? Are you going to continue with that?\n So I might be able to catch you guys again there. \n It must have been disappointing in London \u2014 Let me put it like this: I'm watching the game, and it's \"oh no, they're losing\" but you don't look like you're losing. You look like you're having the time of your life. \n Did you see how many people were there was? \n I was staring up at the top and I could not see the top rows. They were completely in darkness.\n The silver's pretty good! \n It's just that the Gliders have never won. They've never won the World Championship, they've never won at the Paralympics.\n Yeah.\n Really good. \n You played pretty well. \n The whole team needed to find something and lift, because like... we interviewed one of your team mates, and she we can't expect to win if we're shooting 39 per cent. Then of course you went ahead and won two games shooting 39 per cent, which sort of made a bit of a liar out of her...\n The defence was where you won those games. You blocked them off. Particularly , they couldn't... Canada was even better. You kept on forcing turnovers, forcing timeouts. That was the defensive game, was the way you won it. \n But Germany had a good defensive game as well. It must have been good, playing on your birthday.\n So how do you compare London with Beijing and Athens?\n We have a lot of statistics on the response to it. Unfortunately, being in London I couldn't see the coverage. \n Apparently there was extra requests for the Gliders. So more people wanted to see you. \n Yes. \n It seems be be getting bigger with each set of games. \n I've got figures from . London is twice as big. \n Some of the things you were doing. The three point shot from a chair.\n And the speed at which you moved at times, in excess of what someone without a chair could do. It's just a fabulous sport. \n Are you're definitely up for Rio as well? \n Well I look forward to seeing you there. Thanks very much!"}

A wide range of topics about the Paralympics and sport in Spain were discussed including the evolution of Paralympic sport, disability sport classification, funding support across all levels of elite sport including the Paralympics and Olympics, the role of sportspeople in politics, sponsorship issues, and issues of gender in Spanish sport.\nEvolution of the Paralympics.\n Hi this is Laura Hale and I'm interviewing Teresa Perales (), the most decorated Spanish paralympian of all time, and we're in Zaragoza. And you're from Zaragoza, right?\nSo, are you confident that Madrid is going to get , and are you going to stay around?\nYou first competed in . Has there been a big change from 2000 to that you've noticed like in terms of the atmosphere, or even the level of sport and issues of ?\nSponsorship.\nI went to London, and the quality of sport \u2014 you didn't go there and say, that's a person in a wheelchair. You went, fall down guy in a wheelchair, because the sport was so great. There was no embarrassment like the Olympics where they let the people from swim in the pool. [The level of sport] was very equitable [at the Paralympics]. In Australia, there was discussion amongst the Paralympians with the issue of sponsorship because sport is becoming so elite. Do you think Paralympians should be getting sponsorship and on the same level that their able-bodied counterparts are?\nYeah I was asking you about Spain, the Australians are why I asked.\nIs there any difference between men and women?\nIn the US, the system is, you need sponsorship to get to the elite level. In Australia, the government funds Olympians and Paralympians equally. Like players got 7,000 each, so it is interesting to find out how Spain differs.\nClassification.\nAs someone who watched the Paralympics, classification was a huge issue. Mallory Weggemann was an American [Paralympic swimmer] who got reclassified at the Games and the Americans were really upset, and the Australians have said classifiers have won them more medals than the athletes themselves. How important is classification for you and are you happy with the system that exists for swimming?\nIn Atlanta it was really bad...\nSome of the people with the Paralympic movement think understanding classification is key towards moving the Games forward, like how do you convey that to the public, how classification works, so when somebody sees you, an , they go, 'we got times like this, but the S1 swimmers, this, and I can't see much of a difference'. \nLike skiiing?\nThat happened in cycling. Set a World Record, did not win a medal.\nHave you ever had any problems with in your career where they've said...?\nMixing sport and politics.\nIn the US, there is a view that celebrities and sportspeople should stay out of politics because... they're dumb.\n Should sportspeople be involved and do Paralympians especially, should they be more involved because of the nature of the sport they are doing in politics, and is it something in Spain and should be done elsewhere in the world... Should there be a call for more Paralympians in politics? Because you protested in Madrid...\nAnd you were a politician.\nBecause they are disabled, and the way society treats people with disabilities, sets Paralympians off from able-bodied athletes, does that make it special emphasis that they should be more engaged in the political process than someone like Michael Phelps?\nFunding Spanish sport.\nThe Spanish Paralympic Committee is supported primarily by the Government?\nDo they give you as an athlete the support that you need to be successful? \nIs the Spanish Paralympic Committee working to fix this? Is it one of their goals to adjust this problem?\nThey said six...\nBeing an elite female athlete.\nIn other interviews you talk about your family life. That's interesting, but you are an elite female athlete, and there's other interesting questions. Is there anything...?\nHow many women total, then?\nParalympics in some sports have many fewer women than men, especially skiing. Is that something that exists in swimming, and does it hurt the quality of sport? Because the men in the skiing are like, the women, they are so few of them, they embarrass us, is that something that exists on a swimming level?\nPeople say that women don't swim as well as the men, because there's so few?\nIn Australia they say, female sportswomen, fantastic, more medals! So they go for them. And that's not the case here?\nYou're really fascinating. It's a completely different perspective. Is there anything else people should know about Paralympics in Spain, or you?\n I want to thank you a lot, thank you!"}

The rent dispute involved $315,060.70 of rent for months of September 2012 to January 2013 unpaid to the landlord, \"Fourteen Sails Pty Ltd\". The site was . The store had to fire about 40\u201350 employees without a warning in advance.\nThe store was closed three days before Australia Day, January 26, Saturday.\nThe store , Tim Clifton, said they had to ring the workers out of the blue: \"I was advised the landlord had distrained for unpaid rent over the business and that left the directors in the position where the business was untenable. I presume at this stage trading was poor and the company just didn't have the money to pay the rent. ... Unfortunately they had to terminate their employment this morning and we've rung them all. We'll do our best to get them their entitlements under the government schemes, and we calculate what they're owed in the next few days and hopefully get that underway for them. ... It's a sad day. It's a sign of the times isn't it. Things are tough out there.\"\n state secretary Dave Kirner said workers were not allowed to collect their personal belongings left inside of the store: \"I spoke with a worker who said the locks have been changed, they were asked to leave and all their personal belongings are in there\". \nOn Saturday, \"Wikinews\" took photos of the documents available at the store entrance. The rent dispute details and an inventory were available for everyone to read. During the ten minutes of taking photos, around seven people visited the closed entrance and read the documents a first time. One of them commented, \"oh hey, will be stronger\".\nThe store owner, Jarred Spearman, reported negotiations ongoing with the landlord and said he would \"hopefully try to work [our] way out of this ... We are pretty lucky to have the customers and staff we had\".\nPort Adelaide Mayor Gary Johanson said the loss of the store is a significant loss as Port Adelaide is being redeveloped: \"Their staff were extremely good, the service levels were high, the store was always well stocked and it was a great example of a family business. That will be a great loss to the Port.\" \"The landlord is not at fault here. The landlord is acting within their rights. ... This is the sort of thing we cannot afford to lose if we're serious about the Port being redeveloped. This is not a multinational company. This is a franchise of a bigger company but it is a family franchise and it employs a lot of staff. The staff that they employ are local people and they're employing large amounts of staff in relation to their turnover. We need to take stock of what local businesses we have left and say, how can we ensure they stay with us?\""}

Secure Communities includes a provision that ICE can ask state and local detention facilities to hold anyone arrested who might be in the US without adequate documentation until ICE has time to review their case. \nThe comments came in a public hearing of a policy working group of the Public Safety and Justice Committee, convened to discuss a November 7 recommendation by District Attorney Jeff Rosen to honor ICE detainer requests for serious and violent offenders. Since October 18, 2011, Santa Clara County has refused ICE requests to detain individuals who would otherwise be released. \nAnother opportunity for public comment on this occurred this Thursday, at the monthly meeting of the Public Safety and Justice Committee of the Santa Clara County Board of Supervisors. Supporters of DA Rosen's proposal had earlier asked their people to email the supervisors and attend this meeting and the Board of Supervisors' Meeting next Tuesday, February 12. No public comments were made at this Thursday's meeting. \nThe January 31 hearing began with comments by approximately 25 of the audience of roughly 35\u201340, all of which opposed the DA's proposal. They said public safety was enhanced under the current policy because many in the immigrant community have less reason to fear that they or people they care about would be deported if the police were called. Sheriff then described an individual who is now in prison with a rape conviction for an event that would have been prevented if the detention request from ICE had been honored. Several in the audience replied by asking how many other criminals would go free because people refused to report or testify as a result of increased fear of deportation. \nComments supporting the current policy have been made by people who did not attend. The for January 31 includes an by Supervisor Dave Cortese, acting Public Defender Molly O'Neal, and Director of the Domestic Violence Advocacy Consortium Cynthia Hunter. They wrote, \"There is nothing more valuable to public safety than community trust in local law enforcement because it establishes residents' willingness to report crimes and cooperate with police. But that trust will break down immeasurably in immigrant communities if residents face the debilitating fear of deportation. This is especially true in Santa Clara County, where two-thirds of residents live in immigrant households.\" \nSince the January 31 hearing, support for the position of the Sheriff and the DA has begun to materialize with at least one conservative group asking their followers to email the supervisors and attend public meetings such as the one this Thursday and the Board of Supervisors' meeting next Tuesday, February 12. \nThe policy adopted October 18, 2011 stated Santa Clara County would honor ICE detention requests \"for individuals who have been convicted of a serious or violent felony,\" provided ICE agreed in writing to reimburse the county for the additional expense. DA Rosen's November 7 presentation claimed honoring ICE holds would \"produce an undetermined amount of cost savings by reducing probation costs\", as individuals otherwise on probation would be transferred to federal detention. Reports from Colorado and Los Angeles have claimed that ICE holds averaged over 20 days. ICE claims an official limit of at most two days.\nLos Angeles is currently being sued over questionable detentions of a number of individuals including a British filmmaker named Duncan Roy, who was held for 89 days. If Los Angeles loses, it appears local taxpayers may be liable.\nAfter DA Rosen's presentation on November 7, the Santa Clara County Public Safety and Justice Committee referred this issue to its policy review working group, which held various private meetings, failed to reach a consensus, and then organized the public meeting of January 31. The next official action on this issue is currently scheduled for the March 7 meeting of the Public Safety and Justice Committee. "}

Debate has continued this week in the state about gun control as it relates to suicide. Iran's \"PressTV\" published an opinion piece claiming that for every gun owner who uses their weapon in their home for self-defense, there are eleven suicide attempts involving a weapon. In the United States, veterans are more likely to use guns in acts of suicide than acts of homicide. The number of daily suicides by veterans is currently 22.\nGuns are often used in suicide attempts, with reporting on Wednesday that there were 4,643 non-fatal gun involved suicide attempts in 2010. This number contradicts testimony by Wayne LaPierre of NRA to the United States Congress regarding unintentional deaths cause by firearms as LaPierre cited 600 deaths. Australia instituted tougher gun control regulations in 1996, including gun buy back programs. According to a study by Andrew Leigh of Australian National University and Christine Neill of Wilfrid Laurier University, these programs correlate to an 80% drop in suicides involving guns at a time when other methods of suicide remained consistent. \nSimilar research done in the United States has similar results. A 1991 study published in the \"New England Journal of Medicine\" found stricter gun control in the District of Columbia was a likely cause of a reduction in the number of suicides by gun shot in D.C. compared to surrounding areas.

Amendments to the Bill are now to be discussed and voted in the committee stage and then debated in the House of Lords, the unelected upper chamber.\nThe 2013, if passed, would allow same-sex couples to get married in both civil ceremonies and religious ceremonies where a particular denomination has agreed to provide such services. The government have said the Bill contains a \"quadruple lock\", four separate measures to protect the religious freedom of those who do not agree with same-sex marriages on religious grounds.\nBefore the debate.\nThe government's proposals have caused \"growing discord\" within the Conservative Party according to a letter written by a group of Conservative local constituency chairmen. The letter, which was delivered to Downing Street on Sunday, claimed the policy would cause \"significant damage to the Conservative Party in the run-up to the 2015 election\" and \"resignations from the party are beginning to multiply\".\nThe Conservative Sir criticised media focus on the letter sent to Downing Street, telling the BBC the importance of the letter was overblown: \"There are, say, 630 associations, there's now two active officers for each one, that's over 1200. Twenty five past and present officers went to Downing St \u2014 25 out of over 1,000, 2,000, 3,000 \u2014 doesn't strike me as newsworthy.\"\nBottomley said he believes the majority of people in Britain are supportive of same-sex marriage although older people tend to be against it, and said the legislation is \"not going to be a big deal\".\nOn Monday, in response to the letter sent to Downing Street, another letter from fifty grassroots activists within the Conservative Party including constituency chairmen and the chairman of , a group for Conservative supporters aged under 30, argued Conservative MPs should support the Bill: \"Please do not allow the impression that all Conservative Party activists are opposed to gay marriage. Many of us strongly agree with the proposal. Nor is it true that gay marriage has no mandate. David Cameron made his support for it clear in his first conference speech as party leader, and won loud applause. It was in the party's equalities manifesto at the last election.\"\nThe letter said opposition to same-sex marriage would \"risk alienating the voters we will need in 2015\" and argued the plans have broad support from the wider public.\nIn response to criticism from within the Conservative Party, , the government minister responsible for the Bill, wrote an editorial in \"\" defending the proposals. Miller wrote: \"The proposals for change are straightforward \u2014 if a couple love each other, then the state should not stop them getting married unless there is good reason \u2014 and being gay is not reason enough.\"\nMiller defended the bill from accusations it would infringe on religious freedom: \"This bill is about choice. It is about giving those who want to get married the opportunity to do so, while protecting the rights of those who don't agree.\"\nThe Conservative MP for Mid Bedfordshire, , confirmed on Monday in a post for the blog that she plans to vote against the Bill, saying the Bill fails to make heterosexual and gay couples equal because the Bill does not require gay couples \"to make any commitment to faithfulness whatsoever in the way straight couples are required to\" and because there is no requirement for consummation. She also argued it is politically unwise for the Conservative Party, claiming loss of support \"could lose us as many as 100 seats\". Dorries said Labour's introduction of civil partnerships was \"the right thing\" but the Labour Party would not have supported same-sex marriage because it would cost them support from . She argued that if Conservatives push for same-sex marriage to become law, Labour would then not have to take a political hit for passing the Bill.\nThe Conservative Party activist contradicted claims that the Conservatives would face a drastic drop in support, claiming a survey shows it won't affect voter intentions: \"the effect might well be negative in the short-term but \u2014 AT WORST \u2014 it will reduce the Tory vote from about its current 34% to 33%\".\nConservative blogger and radio host \u2014 who is also openly gay \u2014 argued on his blog that a number of the opponents in the Tory ranks are themselves and may face outing attempts by gay rights campaigners. On , Dale said he had looked at a list of MPs who intend to vote against the Bill on the website of Campaign for Equal Marriage: \"I note with interest the names of several MPs who most people in the Westminster Village know to be closet gays. And I note also the names of two supposedly straight MPs who I know to be conducting gay affairs at the moment. I don't believe in 'outing' anyone, but because of the rank hypocrisy there will be others who will take a different view.\"\nBefore the debate, Labour leader Ed Miliband said he will vote \"proudly\" for equal marriage: \"I don't think that the person you love should determine the rights you have. That's why I'll be voting for equal marriage, along with the rest of the shadow cabinet.\"\nLiberal Democrats committed to supporting the policy. A notable exception among the Liberal Democrats is John Pugh MP who said in a letter to his constituents published on Monday he will vote against the Bill because he believes \"it achieves none of its objectives and weakens the link between marriage and the family\".\nIn the run up to the debate, MPs claim to have received emails they characterised as \"vitriolic\", \"appalling\", and \"unpleasant\" from both supporters and opponents of the Bill. The Conservative MP said: \"You get emails from one side saying you're morally deficient if you vote no and emails threatening hell fire and brimstone if you vote yes. It has frankly been an ill-tempered debate on both sides.\"\nSome MPs have said negative emails from opponents have prompted them to support the Bill. An anonymous MP told \"\": \"Quite a few of us who were considering abstaining will vote in favour of gay marriage because of the unreasonable nature of the emails we have been receiving. Some of the emails I've had are simply appalling and I'm fed up with it.\"\nConservative MP , who opposes the Bill, said unpleasant messages have also come from supporters of the Bill: \"I've had death threats, hostility and hate mail. My children have even been told that their dad is a homophobe.\"\nBurrowes made his case against the Bill Tuesday on : \"Marriage has never been just about the happiness and fulfilment of the individuals involved. It is part of a bigger picture \u2014 human societies need stable family groupings, especially for the nurture and care of children. The man-woman union at the heart of marriage has to do with this bigger picture.\"\nBurrowes also argues the marriage Bill will not significantly advance gay rights, pointing instead to his support for an introduction of a new offence of homophobic hatred.\nConservative MP wrote an article defending the legislation for ConservativeHome, arguing \"the Bill respects those who feel that same-sex marriage does represent an attack on their view of marriage\" and since \"nobody is going to be forced to take part in a same-sex marriage who does not wish to do so, I very much hope that in turn they will respect those who feel that the present inequality of marriage is an attack their identity and freedom as individuals.\"\nThe newly elected , , used his first post-appointment public statement to reaffirm the Church of England's opposition to the Bill: \"I stand, as I have always stood over the last few months, with the statement I made at the announcement of my appointment, which is that I support the Church of England's position on this. We have made many statements about this and I stick with that.\"\nThe opinion writer argued the fallout within the Conservative Party has failed to show they are \"a modernised party\" but instead revealed them \"as a nest of bigots\", warning that the party disunity threatens the Conservatives' chances at the next election.\nThe debate.\nThe Second Reading started just after 12:30pm on Tuesday. Maria Miller introduced the bill: \"The depth of feeling, love and commitment between same-sex couples is no different from that depth of feeling between opposite-sex couples. The Bill enables society to recognise that commitment in the same way, too, through marriage. Parliament should value people equally in the law, and enabling same-sex couples to marry removes the current differentiation and distinction.\"\nMiller argued against the charge that the Bill redefines marriage by pointing to previous reforms of marriage law: \"Suggestions that the Bill changes something that has remained unchanged for centuries simply do not recognise the road that marriage has travelled as an institution.\"\nMiller concluded her introduction of the Bill by appealing to fairness: \"Despite all the discussion and debate, this Bill is about one thing \u2014 fairness. It is about giving those who want to get married the opportunity to do so, while protecting the rights of those who do not agree with same-sex marriage. Marriage is one of the most important institutions we have; it binds families and society together, and it is a building block that promotes stability. This Bill supports and cultivates marriage, and I commend it to the House.\"\nThe Labour politician gave the Opposition response. She welcomed the Bill and argued: \"Parliament should not stop people getting married just because they have fallen in love with someone of the same sex, and we should not say that same-sex relationships are intrinsically worth less.\"\nRegarding the claim that the Bill would eventually force religious groups to perform same-sex ceremonies, Yvette Cooper stated: \"It is clear that they will not have to.\"\nCooper also argued against a number of objections to the Bill. She said some object that marriage is by definition between a man and a woman, but: \"We cannot hide discrimination simply by calling it a definition. Marriage has changed many times over the centuries \u2014 and thank goodness for that.\"\nIn response to the argument that marriage is for the purposes of procreation and protection of children, Cooper argued: \"Many marriages are childless, and we do not prevent people who are too old or too sick to have children from getting married. We do not do fertility tests at the altar.\"\nFollowing the speeches of Miller and Cooper, MPs from all parties spoke both for and against the Bill. Opponents argued their opposition to the bill was not driven by homophobia or bigotry, the Labour MP stating: \"the debate has been characterised as bigoted religion on the one hand versus equality on the other.\"\nConservative MP argued marriage exists for children: \"Marriage exists to keep the parents exclusively committed to each other, because, on average, that is the best and most stable environment for children. If marriage were solely about the relationship between two people, we would not bother to enshrine it in law, and nor would every culture, society and religion for thousands of years have invested it with so much importance.\"\nLeigh then suggested proponents were motivated by their own interests rather than the interests of children: \"Marriage is not about 'me, me, me', nor about legally validating 'my rights' and 'my relationships'; it is about a secure environment for creating and raising children, based on lifelong commitment and exclusivity\".\nThe Conservative MP introduced some levity into the debate when he ridiculed the idea that heterosexuals would be threatened by gay and lesbian couples getting married: \"Darling, our marriage is over: Sir Elton John has just got engaged to David Furnish\".\n MP compared the campaign for gay rights to civil rights: \"Separate but equal is a fraud. It's the language that tried to push Rosa Parks to the back of the bus.\"\nDuring the debate, a number of gay MPs spoke in support of the bill. Liberal Democrat MP noted: \"Through my teenage years being openly gay was virtually impossible as it was terrifying in terms of the abuse.\"\nAnother Conservative MP, , spoke of the importance of the bill to him as a gay man: \"Semantics matter. Words express the values of society. This bill about marriage is part of the astonishing and wonderful change that has taken place over the last fifty years that has taken millions of us from criminalisation to legal equality and the enjoyment of self-worth and validation. That certainly wasn't apparent to me as a young man. What I understood was that there was something wrong with me that had \u2014 \"had\" \u2014 to be mastered. And for three decades I managed that struggle. And the relief and happiness of not having to do so any longer comes from others who fought for all of the measures advancing equality over the last five decades that are the precursors to today's Bill.\"\nCrispin Blunt's speech prompted to note he would change from abstaining to supporting the bill.\n closed the debate, praising the House for a \"lively and impassioned debate\" and stated the government's case: \"This is a bill with a very straightforward proposition at its heart: whether extending marriage for same-sex couples strengthens marriage and increases equality or whether it is a threat to religion and society. The Government believes it is the former.\"\nAccording to media reports, more Conservative MPs voted against the Bill than for it in the second reading. Conservative MP said: \"Apparently there's 132 Conservative MPs who voted in favour, so I think what we're going to see is that more Conservative MPs voted against this legislation than for it.\"\nPrime Minister David Cameron welcomed the passage of the Second Reading, saying the legislation represents \"an important step forward for our country\"."}

O'Brien had been expected to take part in the to decide the next Pope and to retire shortly thereafter.\nO'Brien had tendered a resignation to the Pope \"nunc pro tunc\" (now for later) on November 13. He stated yesterday that it had taken effect: \"The Holy Father has now decided that my resignation will take effect today, 25 February 2013, and that he will appoint an apostolic administrator to govern the archdiocese in my place until my successor as archbishop is appointed.\"\nThe sexual abuse allegations were published in \"\" and stem from incidents alleged to have happened as long as three decades ago. The former priest alleges O'Brien approached him inappropriately when he was a seminarian at St Andrew's College in Drygrange in 1980. The former priest claims his resignation from the priesthood was the result of O'Brien's elevation to bishop: \"I knew then he would always have power over me. It was assumed I left the priesthood to get married. I did not. I left to preserve my integrity.\"\nThe three priests allege they were also the subject of unwanted sexual advances from O'Brien. The four complained to Antonio Mennini, the Vatican's ambassador to Britain.

The cardinal has sought legal advice and it would be inappropriate to comment at this time. There will be further statements in due course.

Several other prominent opponents of equal marriage are guilty of double standards and vulnerable to similar exposure. They include anti-gay clergy and politicians. It is estimated that around 40% of Catholic priests in Britain are gay, which makes the church\u2019s opposition to gay equality so two-faced and absurd.\"\nO'Brien has questioned whether the continued requirement that priests be celibate and unmarried should continue. In an interview with BBC Scotland, he said: \"There was a time when priests got married, and of course we know at the present time in some branches of the church \u2014 in some branches of the Catholic church \u2014 priests can get married, so that is obviously not of divine of origin and it could get discussed again.\""}
