Those interviewed include longtime political operative , a close associate of Trump and director of Trump's 2000 presidential exploratory committee; journalist Dave Shiflett, co-writer of Trump's 2000 campaign book \"The America We Deserve\"; and political consultant , who served as chairman of the which Trump briefly joined.\nIn Trump's highly publicized 2016 campaign, he has run under the banner of , advocating a Mexican-funded wall along the , renegotiation of trade terms with other nations, and a temporary halt on the immigration of Muslims to the United States. He holds a considerable lead in delegates over his opponents, winning 15 of the first 24 primary and caucus contests. Though this is Trump's most visible campaign, it is not his first foray into electoral politics. He flirted with Republican presidential runs: first in 1987, when he purchased newspaper advertisements on foreign policy and delivered a campaign-like speech in the first-in-the-nation primary state of New Hampshire; and then in 2011, when he briefly led for the presidential nomination after questioning the citizenship of President Barack Obama. Trump's most extensive campaign before now came during the when he opened an to consider seeking the presidential nomination of the Reform Party. \nFor 2000, Trump conducted various speeches and media appearances in support of his potential presidential campaign. He placed Stone in charge of his exploratory committee and hired Shiflett to work on what would become \"The America We Deserve\". His chief opponent for the nomination was icon and eventual nominee who entered the race after ending his third unsuccessful campaign for the Republican presidential nomination. Based on Buchanan's comments against American involvement in World War II, Trump attacked Buchanan as a \" lover\" and . Trump's campaign received support from then-Minnesota , the highest ranking elected official in the Reform Party. This placed Trump at odds with the faction of industrialist , the party's founder and two time presidential candidate. Verney, a Perot confidante, was chairman of the party during Trump's exploration. Though initially dismissive of the campaign, Verney eventually welcomed Trump into the race. However, the deep divisions within the party precipitated the exit of Ventura, and Trump did not seek the nomination. Despite leaving the race, Trump still appeared on Reform Party presidential primary ballots in California and Michigan, winning both states. \nOver a five month period, Wikinews reporter William S. Saturn contacted the three previously involved in Trump's politics to get their thoughts on his current presidential campaign, learn more about Trump's political past including the true nature of his 2000 effort, and obtain details on his personality.\nRoger Stone.\n\"Wikinews\" first contacted Roger Stone in October. In addition to his association with Trump, for whom he has worked as a lobbyist and advisor, Stone has a long history as a Republican Party operative, known for \"\". He worked on the infamous for President in , during which he performed such tasks as planting a spy in the campaign of Democratic presidential candidate , and sending a donation to a potential Republican primary opponent of Nixon under the name of a socialist organization. After Nixon's resignation, Stone served as Nixon's \"man in Washington.\" He has a tattoo of Nixon's face on his back. Among many campaigns, Stone worked on the presidential campaign of , for which he purportedly brought a suitcase, presumably filled with cash, to the office of an influential lawyer associated with the in order to secure the party's nomination for Independent presidential candidate , effectively splitting opposition to Reagan in the state. Stone has also worked for President George H. W. Bush, Congressman , Senator , and was employed by the George W. Bush to organize against the during the 2000 presidential election. In , Stone volunteered for the presidential campaign of Democrat . And, ahead of the , he founded an anti-Hillary Clinton group with the acronym C.U.N.T. Recently, Stone joined the , and has authored a series of political books including one accusing President of involvement in the of President . Stone served on Trump's current presidential campaign before a well-publicized split last August. He remains a supporter of the campaign and discusses his association with Trump and thoughts on the current campaign. \n Until a few months ago you were a long-time associate of Donald Trump. When did you first meet him and how would you describe him as a person?\n I've been writing an article on Wikipedia about Trump's 2000 presidential campaign. You were director of his presidential exploratory committee. Do you recall when Trump first mentioned to you that he wanted to run?\n Why were you willing to join Trump's 2016 presidential campaign after he was quoted in 2008 by ' describing you as a \"stone cold loser\" who \"always tries taking credit for things he never did\"? \n What are your thoughts on the 2016 presidential race thus far? Can Trump pull off a victory?\nStone refused to answer additional questions on his recent activities including his potential run for the Libertarian Party's 2016 nomination for U.S. Senate in Florida and his October 2015 book \"The Clintons' War on Women\". Stone also did not address the conspiracy theory espoused by 1996 Reform Party vice presidential nominee that Trump's 2000 presidential exploration was a \"dirty trick\" to sabotage the Pat Buchanan campaign and eliminate the Reform Party as an electoral threat to the Republican Party. Russ Verney addresses the theory further below.\nDave Shiflett.\nLast December, \"Wikinews\" reached out to writer Dave Shiflett to talk about his experience with Trump in co-writing \"The America We Deserve\". According to Shiflett in ', Shiflett was approached by Roger Stone who was on assignment from Trump to find the \"most eminent in America\" to write a book about a potential presidential campaign. Shiflett met with Trump for the first time in Spring 1999 to work on the book. It was released in January 2000, a month before Trump announced he would not run. Though not as well known as Trump's first book ', \"The America We Deserve\" has had more relevance to his current run. In November, Trump pointed to the book to claim he recognized the threat of terrorism before the ; the book does warn of attacks by and . Some of Trump's political positions and policy proposals outlined in the book have led to attacks from his Republican primary opponents as being at odds with his 2016 platform including a pro-choice position on (while noting his opposition to partial birth abortion), a ban on (as was the law at the time under the ), and the implementation of . Other positions in the book match his current platform including increased pressure on China, fair trade, and border control. Shiflett says he is not closely following Trump's 2016 campaign and no longer has any interest in politics. Instead, he is focused on making music, which he posts on his website www.daveshiflett.com. He discusses what he remembers about working with Trump.\n Why were you specifically selected to co-write \"The America We Deserve\"?\n What was it like to work with Donald Trump?\n How much input did Roger Stone have in the content of \"The America We Deserve\"?\n Was there any indication that Trump was not serious about the campaign or did not want to run?\nRuss Verney.\n\"Wikinews\" reached out early this month to Russ Verney, who served as chairman of the Reform Party during Trump's exploratory bid for the party's presidential nomination in 2000. Verney previously worked on the of Ross Perot and became chairman of the Reform Party upon its founding by Perot in 1995. When Perot ran as the party's presidential nominee in , he named Verney as campaign director. Later, Verney headed the Perot faction of the party when a schism between Perot's supporters and the supporters of Minnesota governor Jesse Ventura threatened to split the party. With Trump potentially running as a member of the Ventura faction, Verney was initially dismissive of a Trump candidacy. In a July 1999 interview with \"\", he said party members were not drafting Trump for president and \"never spent one second thinking about him.\" Later in the year, Verney commented he had not heard a \"compelling reason [...] for [Trump] to seek the presidency.\" After Trump invited members of the Reform Party, including Verney, to his compound outside in , in January 2000, Verney praised Trump, expressing \"[t]his is him reaching out to all parts of the Reform Party, and that's good.\" However, Trump continued attacks on Pat Buchanan, focusing largely on the support Buchanan garnered from former Ku Klux Klan leader . These comments received greater attention in 2016 when Trump himself received an endorsement from Duke and the Ku Klux Klan. Trump's seeming inability to disavow the support in an interview with (despite an earlier disavowal) formed part of the basis of the March 2016 speech in which Mitt Romney urged Republicans not to vote for Trump. After Trump dropped out of the 2000 race, ceasing his attacks on Buchanan, Buchanan received 0.42% of the general election vote, far below Perot's 1996 showing of 8.40%. After the 2000 election, Verney left the party and began working as a regional director and national adviser for the conservative foundation . In 2008, he worked as campaign manager for the of Libertarian Party nominee . Recently, he was hired as executive director for , a conservative group known for investigative film journalism. Verney answers questions about his meetings with Trump, responds to the accusation that Trump's 2000 exploratory committee was a \"dirty trick\" to hurt the Reform Party, and analyzes Trump's rise in the 2016 campaign.\n You were the chairman of the Reform Party in 1999 when Donald Trump opened an exploratory committee to run for the party's presidential nomination. He invited you and other party members to his Mar-a-Lago Club in Palm Beach. What do you recall about this meeting?\n What was your impression of Donald Trump upon meeting him?\n Pat Choate, Ross Perot's 1996 running mate who became Chairman of the Reform Party in 2000 accused Trump of being a GOP plant to sabotage the Pat Buchanan campaign and eliminate the Reform Party as an electoral threat. Considering that Trump often referred to Buchanan as a \"Hitler-lover\" and that Buchanan did worse than projected in the general election from which the Reform Party never fully recovered, is there any merit to Choate's accusation?\n What are your thoughts on Trump's 2016 campaign?"}

Before entering office, he had served as a councillor for Ward 2 Etobicoke North, a district in Toronto. He described himself as an \"ordinary guy\" who wanted to show \"respect for the taxpayers\", and proposed measures to reduce taxes. Ford was known for personally returning phone calls from constituents and hosting a summer barbecue every year.\nAs a mayor, Ford supported expanding the city's subway system over expanding transit through cheaper means; this caused debate within the city council. Ford also implemented cost cutting measures for the taxpayer, including the abolition of a vehicle registration tax.\nIn 2013, Ford received global media coverage after a video apparently showing Ford smoking crack cocaine was shown to the press. This caused police to investigate Ford and discover he had links with drug dealers. In November of the same year, Ford admitted he may have smoked crack in a \"drunken stupor\". Then, videos apparently showing Ford making offensive comments to minorities and women surfaced. The resulting scandal caused the Toronto City council to remove most of Ford's powers; he wasn't removed from office, however, due to a technicality."}

It features original material compiled throughout the previous month after an overview of the month's biggest stories.\nIn this month's edition on the campaign trail: a former Republican congressman briefly joins the Libertarian Party and runs for vice president; the Democratic Party names its National Convention Platform Drafting Committee amid controversy; and \"Wikinews\" interviews a candidate who had a surprisingly strong performance in the West Virginia Democratic presidential primary. \nSummary.\nOn the campaign trail in early May, the Republican Party primary race grew more contentious as it reached its final stages. On the same day as the May 3 Indiana primary, Republican front-runner Donald Trump, who held a sizable delegate lead over his two remaining primary challengers, Senator of Texas and Ohio Governor , cited the \"\" to accuse Cruz's of involvement in the of President . Cruz, whom Trump branded as \"Lyin' Ted,\" attacked Trump as a \"pathological liar\" and \"serial philanderer.\" Trump won Indiana by a large margin, prompting the second place Cruz to end his campaign. Thereafter, both the media and Chairman christened Trump as the presumptive nominee, even though he had yet to secure the requisite number of National Convention delegates. The next day, Kasich finally suspended his candidacy. As Trump pivoted into general election mode, he faced a vocal within the party and a significant polling deficit against the Democrats. A national CNN/ORC poll showed Trump trailing Democratic front-runner by double digits. Nevertheless, unlike the GOP, the outcome of the Democratic primary race remained undecided. Although Clinton maintained a significant delegate lead, a CNN poll showed her ahead of sole rival, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, by only eight points. In fact, Sanders won the Indiana Democratic primary, making nine victories out of the latest fourteen contests to that point.\nCommencing his general election campaign, Trump announced he would participate in fundraising after self-funding his primary campaign. He named former presidential rival, retired neurosurgeon to head a group to search for a running mate. And, in a show of pro- sentiment, he tweeted a photo of himself with a on . Still, the Republican Party remained divided. Paul Ryan said he would not commit to endorsing Trump. He called for Trump \"to set aside bullying, [...] belittlement, and appeal to higher aspirations.\" Ryan's comments drew criticism from former House Speaker Newt Gingrich and former 2016 presidential candidate Mike Huckabee, among others. However, former candidates and , as well as former Presidents George W. Bush and George H. W. Bush, all said they could not support Trump's candidacy. 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney and \"\" editor both called for an independent presidential candidate to run as an alternative to Trump. Ryan called this \"a disaster,\" and sought unity by inviting Trump to a Republican congressional leadership meeting and offering to step down as chair of the GOP National Convention if Trump so desired. Despite the internal strife, Trump continued his focus on the general election, branding Clinton as \"crooked Hillary,\" and attacking her for \"want[ing] to abolish the .\" He also pivoted on policies, advocating for a rise in the federal and taxes on the wealthy. The campaign announced that five or six names were on the vice presidential shortlist including former presidential candidate . showed Trump leading or close behind Clinton in head-to-head match ups in Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Florida. Clinton won the caucus in Guam and the campaign shifted to West Virginia and Nebraska. On the eve of the May 10 primaries, Cruz, still on the ballot in Nebraska, announced he might restart his campaign if he won the state. Instead, Trump won Nebraska by a wide margin and won West Virginia by an even wider margin. On the Democratic side, Sanders won West Virginia as voters turned on Clinton after she expressed unencouraging views about the . ABC News exit polling there revealed nearly half of Sanders supporters said they would vote for Trump if Clinton won the nomination.\nVice President Joe Biden, who had been expected to mount a 2016 campaign until he ruled it out in late 2015, admitted in an interview with ABC that he had planned to run for president in 2016 but the plans derailed upon the death of his son . He revealed Senator as his preferred running mate and endorsed her for the Democratic vice presidential nomination. Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada cautioned Democrats against nominating a sitting Senator like Warren to avoid decreasing the number of Democrats in the Senate. Trump launched an assault on Warren, referring to her as \"goofy\" and for a previous claim of ancestry. On May 12, Trump had his much anticipated meeting with Ryan. Afterwards, the two issued a joint statement calling the meeting \"a very positive step toward unification.\" Ryan still withheld his endorsement though Trump asked Ryan to remain as chair of the National Convention. Polls from mid-May showed Trump edging closer to Clinton in national head-to-head match ups, as Trump faced a barrage of controversies. Both Clinton and Romney called on Trump to release his tax records. He said he might release them, but maintained it was \"none of [the public's] business.\" Media reports also scrutinized Trump for allegedly acting as his own publicist in the early 1990's. He denied the allegations outright. Next, \"The New York Times\" published an expos\u00e9 about Trump's treatment of women throughout the years. The validity of the story came into question when the lead interviewee claimed \"The Times\" had taken her account out of context. On May 17, Trump easily won the Oregon primary. The next day, for the first time in months, a Fox News poll showed him with a national lead over Clinton. That same day, he released a list of eleven judges whom he would consider nominating to the U.S. Supreme Court. He later received an endorsement from the . In the Democratic race, Sanders won the Oregon primary and narrowly lost to Clinton in Kentucky. He was also able to add five of his supporters to the Democratic National Convention platform drafting committee, ensuring greater influence over the party platform. Clinton rejected a debate with him and announced there would be no further primary debates. Trump offered to debate Sanders, which Sanders accepted, though Trump later backed out. Clinton went on the offensive against Trump for his past business bankruptcies, saying he \"could bankrupt America like he's bankrupted his companies.\" She won the Washington primary on May 24. However, the next day, an Inspector General report said she did not comply with State Department policy when she sent official e-mails on a private server while Secretary of State.\nFollowing a victory in the Washington Republican primary, Trump traveled to New Mexico, where the sitting Republican governor snubbed his event. Trump attacked Martinez during the rally, later asking, \"If I have a Republican that\u2019s not on my side, why should I be particularly nice to that person?\" Shortly thereafter, during a speech in California, he renewed attacks against Romney, Cruz, Kristol, and Jeb Bush. Former rival Marco Rubio announced he would release the delegates he won during the primary to support Trump and said he would be willing to go on the campaign trail for Trump, if asked. Rubio also apologized to Trump for derogatory comments he made earlier in the campaign. Trump mathematically secured the Republican nomination, when an uncommitted slate of delegates in North Dakota committed to supporting him. Meanwhile, the Libertarian Party commenced its and nominated for president, on the second ballot, former New Mexico Governor Gary Johnson, the party's 2012 presidential nominee. Also on the second ballot, for vice president, the party nominated Johnson's pre-selected running mate, former Massachusetts Governor , who had just left the Republican Party to become a Libertarian. Trump called Johnson a \"fringe candidate.\" Johnson was not the last such candidate introduced in late May. Seemingly ending his search for an alternative to Trump, Kristol tweeted that he had found an \"impressive\" independent candidate. Bloomberg reported the candidate was little-known writer of the \"\". On the final day of May, Trump held a press conference in which he revealed the veterans charities he donated to after raising $5.6 million during a fundraiser he held in January in lieu of attending a debate. Trump excoriated the national press for its coverage of his campaign and referred to one reporter as \"sleaze.\" With the June 7 California primary ahead, Clinton received the endorsement of California . The latest polls showed her with a two point advantage over Sanders in the state. In the average, she led Trump in the general election nationally by 1.5%.\nEx GOP congressman joins LP, seeks VP, then leaves.\nAs soon as Donald Trump secured the Republican presidential nomination, Libertarian Party (LP) membership applications doubled. Longtime Republican consultant , former Massachusetts governor William Weld, and former Congressman of Michigan, were among those who left the GOP in May to find a new home in the LP. While Matalin enthusiastically backed Libertarian presidential runner-up Austin Petersen, and Weld won the party's vice presidential nomination; Bentivolio, who had endorsed Dr. Ben Carson for president before joining the party, had a much different experience. \n\"It was suggested by a few supporters I run [for vice president] as a libertarian,\" says Bentivolio, a teacher and veteran of the and wars, who earned the moniker \"the accidental Congressman\" after his surprising 2012 election, \"I briefly entertained the idea of running and spent time investigating the party.\"\nBentivolio, 64, unexpectedly won the Republican nomination to represent in 2012, after the sitting Congressman, Thaddeus McCotter, a 2012 presidential candidate, was unable to run for re-election after his petitions to qualify for the primary ballot were deemed fraudulent. Upon his victory in the general election, Bentivolio went to Washington, joining the and the . He took an active role in introducing and sponsoring successful legislation, becoming, according to an historian of the House, one of the most effective freshmen Congressmen of recent times. listed him as the most transparent Republican freshman in the . Nevertheless, during his single term, he frequently bucked the party leadership, voting against a resolution to the , calling for the of President Barack Obama, and agreeing to seek congressional hearings over . In 2014, Bentivolio lost his seat to attorney , a primary opponent with a fundraising edge and the backing of the Republican establishment. After leaving Congress, Bentivolio suffered financial difficulties and had to file for in 2015, partly the result of his expensive primary campaign against Trott. \nWhen Bentivolio joined the LP in May, he filed a Form 2 with the Federal Election Commission to run for vice president. Libertarian national chairman encouraged Bentivolio to run for his old congressional seat in addition to vice president. This was not well received by the local Libertarian Party, which feared such a run would violate Michigan's ; the same law that prevented Gary Johnson from appearing on the ballot in 2012. As a consequence, the local party nominated another candidate to run for the seat.\n\"The district delegates [five in total] voted for another as the House candidate\", recounts Bentivolio, \"[the candidate's] wife was the deciding vote.\"\nAfterwards, Bentivolio expressed doubt about the party platform, saying it amounted to \"judicial supremacy,\" which he rejects, referencing the 1857 , which affirmed the rights of slaveholders. He added, \"I am 100% and an and many in the Libertarian Party are and support slavery in their immigration policy.\" He cited these as his reasons for ending his vice presidential campaign.\nAfter Gary Johnson and William Weld won the party's presidential and vice presidential nominations at the 2016 Libertarian National Convention, Bentivolio offered his perspective on Johnson and Weld. Though he considered Johnson, \"a nice guy and honest,\" he felt Johnson \"thinks government has all the answers.\" In contrast, Bentivolio said he personally believes \"government is the problem\" and only supports \"a government within the strict limitations clearly expressed in the Constitution.\" He described Weld, a member who proposed strict measures as governor, as someone who \"supports big government.\" \nBentivolio has left the LP and now is an independent. He remains undecided on whether to support Donald Trump for president. To help him decide, he is currently researching claims of a woman named \"Katie Johnson\" who filed a lawsuit accusing Trump of rape. Trump's attorneys dismiss the suit as a hoax.\nDNC aims for unity with Platform Drafting Committee picks; controversy ensues.\nEvery four years, the Democratic Party holds its National Convention, nominating a presidential ticket and conducting official business. One important item is the drafting of a to express the party's principles and vision for the future. A special committee is formed to draft the document. In May, fifteen individuals were named to the committee. Democratic National Committee (DNC) chair selected four of the members while the two presidential candidates picked the remaining eleven in proportion to the votes each candidate received in the primaries. Hillary Clinton, the party's presidential front-runner, selected six. Bernie Sanders chose five, though the DNC rejected one of his original picks, a union leader, leading to charges of anti-union bias in the DNC. Still, upon the release of the names, \"\" magazine argued Sanders' input provided the committee with a \" majority.\" \"Wikinews\" was able to reach out to one of Sanders' picks to see what he planned for the platform.\nFor the committee, Wasserman Schultz tapped Congressman Elijah Cummings, who is to serve as the head; Congresswoman , the only returning member from 2012; former Congressman ; and Bonnie Schaefer, former of . Clinton selected Ambassador ; , head of the ; ; , former administrator of the (EPA); Congressman ; and union leader Paul Booth. Sanders picked Dr. ; Congressman , the first Muslim elected to the US Congress; , head of the ; , a Native American activist; and , a renowned environmentalist.\nMcKibben, a Schumann Distinguished Scholar at who co-founded the climate change awareness organization , tells \"Wikinews\" that his Vermont roots may explain why Sanders selected him for the committee. However, McKibben has worked with Sanders previously on climate and energy issues, and \"The Boston Globe\" has described him as \"probably the nation\u2019s leading environmentalist.\"\n\"I'd like to see [the platform] reflect the fact that since the last election the planet's climate has deteriorated dramatically, with record temperatures, melting ice, and dying coral\", says McKibben, \"So that means we need to move more aggressively, both to cut our reliance on fossil fuels and to boost renewable energy.\" \nMcKibben is not the only member who prioritizes environmental issues. Browner, who headed the EPA during the entire presidency of Bill Clinton, has worked under President Obama as the director of the . While the environment is given a strong emphasis, Sanders has raised the point that labor representation on the committee is lacking. \nIn 2012, union leaders Donna Harris-Aikens of the and Thea Lee of the were on the committee. This year, the only union leader is Booth of the . Sanders attempted to include executive director , but Wasserman Schultz vetoed the pick. Sanders, in a press conference, accused the DNC of \"not want[ing] representatives of labor unions on the platform drafting committee.\" The DNC rejected the charge.\n\"We worked carefully with both campaigns to ensure overall balance and representation,\" says DNC spokeswoman April Mellody, \"[we] have 100% confidence that the views of our allies in the Labor community will be well represented in our Party\u2019s platform as they have always been.\"\nAmid the division, McKibben expresses hope that though the platform is often \"forgotten not long after it's written,\" perhaps the 2016 platform \"will play a role in uniting the party.\"\nThe committee is set to convene at the July 25\u201328 in Philadelphia.\nInterview with overachieving West Virginia Democratic protest candidate.\nIn the May 10 West Virginia Democratic primary, Bernie Sanders defeated Hillary Clinton 51.4 percent to 35.8 percent. Of the remaining 13 percent, nearly nine went to little-known protest candidate , a attorney who entered the race to challenge President Obama's energy policies. \"Wikinews\" reached out to Farrell to ask a few questions about the campaign.\nDuring the campaign, Farrell did not hold any fundraisers and his only spending was the $2,500 filing fee to appear on the ballot. He believes Obama's policies, which Clinton supports, have hurt the coal industry, a major sector of West Virginia's economy. Many West Virginians, even Democrats, share this view. While mining still makes up 17 percent of West Virginia's (compared to 3 percent nationally), since 2009, coal production has declined around 45 percent in the south part of the state. 332 mines have closed and almost 10,000 jobs or 35 percent of those in the industry, have been lost. West Virginia's unemployment is the worst in the nation. According to ABC News exit polls from the primary, only 26 percent of West Virginia Democrats want to continue Obama's policies.\nAlthough registered Democrats outnumber Republicans roughly 577,000 to 378,000 in West Virginia, Republican presidential candidates have won the state in every election since . ABC exit polls indicate a third of Democrats plan to vote in November for Trump, who has campaigned in favor of the coal industry. Trump is popular in West Virginia, having won 77 percent in the state's GOP primary. He holds a 27 point lead over Clinton in the latest head-to-head match up.\nWest Virginia Democrats have a history of going against the national party establishment. Notably, prison inmate won 41 percent in the 2012 primary against Obama, who was seeking re-election. Judd was on the ballot again in 2016, but received only 1.8 percent of the vote. Judd's 2012 performance was one of the reasons Farrell cited for entered the race. In addition, he told the \"Charleston Gazette\u2013Mail\" back in January that the candidates running did not share \"West Virginia values.\" He had hoped to secure some national convention delegates but just fell short. He was able to come in second place in the coal-rich , where he outpaced Clinton 23.7 percent to 21.4 percent.\nWith \"Wikinews\", Farrell discusses, his specific problem with Obama's energy policy, what he is looking for in a presidential candidate, and his views on Trump.\n How were you able to get over 8% of the vote in the West Virginia Democratic Primary?\n Do you plan on supporting the Democratic presidential nominee come November?\n What are your thoughts on presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump?"}

It features original material compiled throughout the previous month after an overview of the month's biggest stories.\nIn this month's edition on the campaign trail: the effect of the vote on the US presidential election is examined; a well known businessman and sports team owner pitches his candidacy for vice president; and \"Wikinews\" interviews the winner of the American Independent Party California primary.\nSummary.\nAs June began, national opinion polls showed Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton with a slight lead over presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump. Despite being mathematically eliminated, Senator Bernie Sanders remained in the Democratic race. He still held close in head-to-head match ups against Clinton in delegate-rich California ahead of that state's June 7 primary. Clinton, who won the June 4 Virgin Islands caucuses, focused her energies on Trump, delivering a speech criticizing his candidacy. Trump responded, saying the country \"is gonna die\" were Clinton elected president. Trump secured the holdout endorsement of House Speaker Paul Ryan and threats of a Republican establishment revolt subsided when ' writer , the preferred presidential choice of ' editor , announced he would not run. However, Trump came under intense criticism, largely from fellow Republicans, when he accused the judge hearing a lawsuit over his venture , , of bias due to the judge's Mexican heritage. Ryan called the comments \"racist.\" Trump's former rivals John Kasich, Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio, and all denounced the comments. Lindsey Graham labeled Trump's remark \"the most un-American thing from a politician since .\" Senator renounced his endorsement of Trump. And former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, an early Trump supporter and potential running mate, called Trump's statement \"inexcusable\" and \"one of the worst mistakes Trump has made.\" Trump described Gingrich's criticism as \"inappropriate.\" Shortly thereafter, Gingrich argued that Trump's concerns were \"valid and reflect a growing pattern of politicized justice.\" Trump said the media and others \"misconstrued\" his words. Clinton speculated that Trump was using the attack to divert attention from the Trump University case.\nOn the eve of the California primary, Clinton won Puerto Rico. With the delegates gained from her victory as well as a few additional , Clinton surpassed the 2,383 delegate threshold to secure the Democratic nomination. The Associated Press, NBC, and ABC all declared Clinton as the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee. The next day, Clinton won the California primary and also those held in New Jersey, New Mexico, and South Dakota. Sanders won the Montana primary and North Dakota caucus. Sanders remained in the race but reportedly planned to cut his campaign staff by half. He announced plans to continue his campaign through the June 14 District of Columbia primary. On the Republican side, during what was the final night for GOP primaries, Trump swept all the June 7 contests in California, Montana, New Jersey, New Mexico, and South Dakota. In the end, Trump received a record total of 13.2 million votes in the GOP primaries. Still, his reserved only $1.2 million in television advertisements, compared to the $108 million Clinton's Super PAC reserved. In addition, Trump stepped back from his previous fundraising goal of $1 billion, insisting he only needed half that amount. In terms of running mates, Gingrich denied having any interest on the GOP side. For Democrats, Senate Minority Leader backed away from his initial reluctance and endorsed the idea of Senator filling the role. Warren took to the stump, endorsing Clinton and condemning Trump as \"a loud, nasty, thin-skinned, fraud\" and \"wannabe tyrant.\" In response, Trump tweeted his desire for \"goofy\" Warren to receive the vice presidential nomination and accused her of having a \"nasty mouth\" and \"one of the least productive\" records in the Senate. Other Democrats also gave their support to Clinton. President Barack Obama endorsed her candidacy as did former presidential rival . Sanders stopped short of supporting Clinton, but said he would \"do everything in [his] power\" to defeat Trump. On the other hand, several Republicans distanced themselves from Trump. GOP booster and CEO hinted she would endorse Clinton, and 2012 GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney said he was leaning toward backing Libertarian Party presidential nominee . Romney said he could not back Trump because of Trump's \"racism ... bigotry ... [and] misogyny.\" Trump responded that he was \"the least racist person that you've ever encountered\" and attacked Romney as \"absolutely pathetic,\" saying Romney \"choked like a dog\" during his loss to President Obama in the 2012 presidential election. Polls from June 10 showed Clinton leading Trump nationwide with leads ranging from three to eleven percentage points.\nThe campaign took a new turn on June 12 when a at a in , Florida left 49 dead. The shooter expressed allegiance to . In the aftermath, Trump tweeted appreciation for those congratulating him for \"being right on radical \" but said he did not want the congratulations, preferring \"toughness and vigilance\" instead. He attacked President Obama as someone who \"doesn't get it, or he gets it better than anybody understands.\" \"The Washington Post\" published an article interpreting the comment as suggesting Obama was \"\" in the shooting. In response, Trump revoked the press credentials of the \"Post\". On the day following the shooting, Trump delivered a speech condemning it as \"an assault on the ability of free people to live their lives, love who they want and express their identity\". He criticized Clinton's immigration policies as opening the door for Islamic radicals espousing anti-LGBT views and said he would be a better protector of LGBT rights than Clinton. In addition, he slammed Clinton and Obama for not using the term \"radical Islamic terrorism.\" Clinton, who denounced the shooting as an \"act of terror\" and \"an act of hate,\" said she was comfortable using the term \"radical .\" This prompted Trump to declare he had \"shamed\" Clinton into using the term. Furthermore, Clinton touted her support for a ban on and gun ownership for those on the . Trump agreed on the last point and said he would attempt to convince the , which had endorsed him, to support such a measure. With the shooting dominating news coverage, the final Democratic primary was held on June 14 in Washington, D.C. Clinton handily defeated Sanders. A poll of Sanders supporters showed 22% planned to vote for Trump, 15% for Gary Johnson, and 55% for Clinton. The same poll showed a 12 point advantage for Clinton over Trump, 49% to 37% with 9% for Johnson. A CBS poll showed a tighter race with Clinton leading Trump 39% to 32% with Johnson at 11%. Clinton and Trump shared high unfavorable ratings in an ABC/Washington Post poll with 55% of respondents having a negative opinion of Clinton and 70% having a negative opinion of Trump. \nDissension within the Democratic Party appeared to crest in mid-June. Sanders finally admitted \"it doesn't appear that I'm going to be the nominee\" and said he planned to vote for Clinton in the general election. This came even as reports showed Sanders was not being considered for the vice presidential nomination. According to \"\" the individuals being vetted for the position were Senator Warren, Secretary of Labor , Secretary of Housing and Urban Development , Los Angeles Mayor , Senators , , and , as well as Congressmen and . Meanwhile, Trump's June struggles continued as the DNC opposition research file on him was hacked, reportedly by the Russian government, then leaked and published on . Trump accused the DNC of orchestrating the hack itself to publicize \"misleading and/or entirely inaccurate\" information. Next, a number of prominent Republicans endorsed Clinton, including former Deputy Secretary of State and former Treasury Secretary , both members of the George W. Bush administration. Congressman claimed there were many other Republicans who would privately vote for Clinton over Trump without saying so publicly. Reports of an anti-Trump delegate coup at the Republican National Convention were published in \"The Washington Post\". Trump denied this as a media-crafted hoax. Additionally, Federal Election Commission reports showed the Trump campaign short on cash with only $1,289,507 available. Citing need for a change, Trump fired campaign manager replacing him with . Combating the dissension within the party, national co-chairman went on CNN, demanding Republicans \"to get behind the presumptive nominee ...[or] just shut the hell up.\" The outlook for the Trump campaign improved with the vote in the United Kingdom to exit from the European Union. Trump publicly backed the exit, which was hailed as a populist reaction similar to the movement behind Trump. Trump, who was in Scotland at the time opening a golf course, explained the vote as the UK taking \"back their country. That's a great thing.\" At the end of June, an NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll showed Trump trailing Clinton by only one point nationwide, 39% to 38%, with Johnson at 10% and presumptive Green Party presidential nominee at 6%. By June 30, a poll showed Trump with a four point lead over Clinton, 43% to 39%. In the average at the close of June, Clinton led Trump 44.6% to 39.8%. \nBrexit's impact on the US presidential election.\nIn June, the United Kingdom voted to exit from the European Union, resulting in the resignation of . This historic turn of events, termed the Brexit, had ramifications of international import. Particularly, the moment became one of political significance in the United States due to the involvement of both President Barack Obama and presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump. Comparisons of the anti-establishment Brexit movement were made with the anti-establishment campaign of Trump. Seeking professional analysis, \"Wikinews\" looked to political science to better understand the potential impact of the Brexit vote on the 2016 US presidential election.\nLast April, President Obama inserted himself into the politics of Brexit, urging Britain to remain in the European Union. He wrote an editorial for \"\" and held a press conference with Prime Minister Cameron in which he warned that if Britain divorced itself from the EU, it would go \"to the back of the queue\" in terms of a trade agreement with the United States. In contrast, Donald Trump argued in favor of Brexit, connecting it to the larger issue of immigration. Commentators noted the goals of the Brexit movement aligned with Trump's protectionist views on trade and support for immigration restriction. Former London , a leading proponent of Brexit, was himself compared to Trump.\nThe most immediate impact of Brexit on the United States came just after reports of the 52 percent to 48 percent vote, when stocks tanked. Markets rebounded somewhat since, though uncertainty remains. Hillary Clinton attacked Trump for the consequence. Her foreign policy advisor argued that \"Trump actively rooted for this outcome and the economic turmoil in its wake\". Clinton ran an ad in which she accused Trump of benefiting financially from a market downturn. Trump labeled the ad \"disgraceful\" and claimed she was \"trying to wash away her bad judgment call on BREXIT with big dollar ads.\"\nTrump's head-to-head polling numbers against Clinton increased somewhat after the June 23 vote. Trump rose in the survey from a five point deficit before to a four point lead after. In Gravis, Trump cut Clinton's four point lead in half. However, deficits for Trump remained unchanged for the / and the / polls. \nPollster of Zogby Analytics expects Trump's position to improve as a result of Brexit. He tells \"Wikinews\", the vote \"strengthens populism and gives Trump supporters some wind at their back.\" As for Clinton, he foresees difficulties due to the closeness of the race and the perception of Clinton as \"the rep of the elites at a bad time to be so.\"\nPolitical scientist , a professor of European Union politics at , mostly agrees. Though the Brexit impact is difficult to predict, McCormick explains to \"Wikinews\" that \"some of the forces that led to Brexit are also behind the popularity of Donald Trump, and in that sense Brexit has opened the door a little wider to the possibility of a Trump presidency.\"\n\"A lot of people voted for Brexit because they resented the manner in which they thought establishment politicians had ignored their needs, or were fearful of more emigration, or disliked the effects of globalization, or had bought into populist warnings about the growing domestic threats of Islamist extremist terrorism\", says McCormick, \"So people here are going to be voting for Trump for many of the same reasons they voted for Brexit in the UK, and in that sense the vote will have an effect on the November election.\"\nMcCormick also believes further economic disturbance could result from Brexit, which could itself have an effect on the election as US voters head to the polls. \nAmid talk of secession in Scotland, Northern Ireland, and London, the UK Conservative Party was to select a new Prime Minister to oversee Brexit and attempt to unify the kingdom. The selection was thought likely to be made in October, just a month ahead of the US presidential election.\nCuban makes vice presidential pitch.\nWith the concluding its season in June, owner has a new sport to follow. As he revealed last August in a chat on his social media app Cyber Dust, \"5 weeks till training camp [...] [b]ut until then Donald Trump watching is a sport.\" Though Cuban, a fellow businessman and billionaire, then praised Trump's unconventional candidacy as \"probably the best thing to happen to politics in a long, long time\", and even offered himself as a possible running mate, he has since grown critical of the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, questioning his wealth, temperament, and business acumen. The marked change has led to speculation about Cuban's own political aspirations. In May, members of the #NeverTrump movement approached him about running for president as an independent, which he rejected. He did, however, open himself to running as the running mate for presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, punctuating that possibility with a statement that he is leaning toward voting for her over Trump in November. As the approaches, Cuban has continued to express his interest in the position.\nCuban addressed the vice presidency on the May 22 edition of \"\", proclaiming that, if offered, he would join Clinton's ticket on the condition she \"go more to the center\" politically. He explained, \"I like the fact that Senator Clinton has thought-out proposals.\" Nevertheless, he has criticized Clinton for having \"no personality\", \"no charisma\", and for making \"horrible mistakes\" as Secretary of State, mentioning the 2012 on the American consulate in , Libya. Nevertheless, Cuban says he is willing to look past all that, believing the main issue is \"whether or not I can add value and whether or not I can impact any perspective and hopefully have a positive impact on the country\". \nJames Pethokoukis, writing for \"\", explains how Cuban can add value to a Democratic ticket. Describing Cuban as charismatic and well spoken, Pethokoukis says Cuban would neutralize Trump's appeal as an outsider candidate while making the Democratic ticket \"more palatable\" to disaffected Republicans. Though the nomination of a centrist businessman could upset progressives, Pethokoukis feels Cuban's Pennsylvania background could provide a compelling story for the majority of the electorate.\n\"Basically, Cuban is Trump\", writes Pethokoukis, \"without all the bigotry ... and without the insane policies ... and with probably more dough.\" \nKyle Kondik of the disagrees with Pethokoukis's premise. \"To me, the first rule of vice presidential selection is 'first, do no harm'\", he explains to \"Wikinews\", \"Cuban would be a risky choice for Clinton that does not provide an obvious benefit[...] One of Clinton's benefits in this election is that, compared to Trump, she seems qualified for the job and serious enough for the job. Picking Cuban doesn't really help her make that argument.\"\nDan Judy of North Star Opinion Research agrees, commenting to \"Wikinews\" that Cuban has \"virtually no chance\" of becoming Clinton's running mate because, \"he's a political novice who doesn't bring much to the table in terms of shoring up Hillary's left flank, appealing to independents, or being a governing partner. Cuban's a colorful, outspoken guy, and I think he's just having fun. I don't think he has any real political ambitions.\"\nClinton insiders also say Cuban has no chance. However, Clinton herself is appreciative of Cuban's \"openness,\" announcing on \"Meet the Press\" that she is \"very interested\" in considering \"successful businesspeople\" who have not held elected office. \nStill, Cuban has continued to make media appearances touting himself as a potential vice presidential candidate. He even went on the attack against a front-runner for the position, Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, arguing she is too far left and that if she were selected, he would probably vote for Trump. In addition, Cuban recently boasted to that Clinton \"needs me\" for the position. \nAt the end of June, Cuban met with former President , husband of Hillary, at a casual dinner party where politics were discussed. \nClinton is expected to choose a running mate before the July 25 National Convention commences in Philadelphia. Senators Warren, Cory Booker of New Jersey, Tim Kaine of Virginia, Sherrod Brown of Ohio, and Julian Castro are among the favorites to receive the vice presidential nomination.\nCalifornia American Independent Party primary winner speaks to Wikinews.\nThough most of the media attention of the June 7 California primary focused on the Democratic and Republican races, with Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump winning each, respectively, the , the Green Party, the Libertarian Party, and the (AIP) all held primaries as well, owing to the fact that each has attained the status of political party in the state; a designation reserved for parties that can show they have registered members totaling greater than 0.33% of registered voters in the state, and maintained with either keeping registered voters at that percentage or holding 0.067% of registered voters while winning at least two percent of the vote in a statewide election. The largest of these third parties, the AIP, had seven participants in its primary. \"Wikinews\" reached out to the victor, Alan Spears, an attorney from .\nThe AIP is a group formerly affiliated with the Constitution Party. It opposes , abortion, and supports the construction of a fence along the . Though the party has an estimated half million registered members, three percent of all registered voters in California, a \" poll shows 73% mistakenly joined the party believing they were registering as . As a result, these voters could only vote in the American Independent Party primary. \nAccording to the latest count, 42,241 voted for the candidates on the ballot in the primary. \" speculated Donald Trump won the primary since more than two thirds of voters wrote-in candidates, the majority believed to have been for Trump, but these votes were not counted. Of the candidates on the ballot, Spears won with 8,103 votes (19.2%). Former engineering technician Arthur Harris came in second with 7,216 (17.1%). 2012 AIP vice presidential nominee and hip hop artist finished third with 7,164 (17%). Fourth place , a pastor and TV host, edged fifth place J.R. Myers, chairman of the Constitution Party, by one vote, 5,476 to 5,475 (roughly 13% apiece). presidential nominee came in sixth with 4,462 (10.6%). Surprisingly, the AIP's 2012 presidential nominee came in last place with 4,345 votes (10.3%). The results of the primary are nonbinding. The AIP is to nominate its 2016 presidential ticket at its convention August 13\u201314.\nSpears, who uses the slogan \"Let's Restore America's Greatness,\" proclaims on his candidate statement provided to the , \"[w]e [Americans] are at war with Islam!\" He focuses his presidential campaign on the issue of , advocating the use of \"overwhelming force\" to combat it. Additionally, he believes the US government \"must deal with hiding behind the who seek to destroy our institutions,\" and supports an eradication of the \"Deep .\" \nWith \"Wikinews\", Spears discusses his primary victory, the AIP nomination, ballot access, and what he hopes to accomplish with his campaign.\n What is your reaction to winning the California American Independent Party presidential primary in June? Do you believe this victory will help you secure the AIP presidential nomination?\n Are you attempting to appear on the ballot in other states? If so, where? If not, why?\n What do you hope to accomplish by running for president?"}

A few days later, FBI Director held a press conference where he announced that charges would not be appropriate against Clinton. He noted, however, that Clinton had acted carelessly in installing a private e-mail server for State business and had risked compromising State secrets. Presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump tweeted that the lack of charges in the case showed \"the system is totally rigged!\" Polls from the early part of the month gave Clinton a slight lead in the race. She led the July 4 Real Clear Politics average 44.9% to 40.3%. At this time, media interest in the running-mate selections of Trump and Clinton intensified. \"\" speculated that New Jersey and former Newt Gingrich were the leading contenders to be Trump's running mate. However, other reports pointed to Indiana governor , who confirmed he would accept the position if asked. Trump commented that ten names were on the shortlist including some not mentioned in the media. In later days, General was floated as a possibility in reports. Gingrich, Flynn, and Pence were apparently finalists for the position, with Pence believed to be the favorite. For the Democrats, Senator , Congressman and received mention as potential running mates for Clinton, but the shortlist reportedly included Senators , , , and .\nOn July 7, Trump arrived in Washington D.C. and met with Republican members from the House of Representatives and Senate. During the meeting, Trump reportedly told the attendees if they did not support his candidacy, they were, in effect, supporting Clinton. Trump agreed to allow his former rival, Senator Ted Cruz, to speak at the convention, but he did not secure an endorsement from Cruz. The next day, both Trump and Clinton canceled campaign events as an African American shooter in killed five police officers. Trump's state chairman in Virginia blamed the shooting on Clinton and others \"who label police as racists.\" In the aftermath, Trump proclaimed himself the \" candidate.\" Ahead of its convention, the GOP platform committee approved a socially conservative platform that opposed and identified as a \"public health crisis.\" The convention's host, Ohio , a former presidential rival of Trump, would not endorse Trump and claimed through a spokesman that Trump had asked Kasich join the presidential ticket in May, but Kasich had declined. Trump's spokesman denied the claim. Another former rival, former Florida governor , said he might vote for Libertarian Party presidential nominee Gary Johnson instead of Trump. On the other side, Hillary Clinton's principal rival, Senator , dropped his campaign and officially endorsed Clinton. Clinton also seemingly received support from Supreme Court Justice who called Trump \"a faker\" and wondered why he has \"gotten away\" with not releasing his tax returns. Democratic Senator questioned whether the country was \"well served\" with a Supreme Court justice openly discussing her political views. Trump referred to Ginsburg's comments as \"highly inappropriate.\" Ginsburg later apologized.\nTrump announced he would officially name his running mate on July 15. Though Pence was the favorite to receive the nod, Trump met with Senator , and had additional meetings with Christie and Gingrich. According to multiple news reports, Trump's daughter , her husband , and financier all tried to convince Trump to select Gingrich, while campaign manager favored Pence, and pollster Tony Fabrizio wanted Flynn. CNN reported Trump had offered the position to Pence, who accepted. According to NBC, the purported leak of the news had left Trump \"seething.\" Due to the July 14 attack in , France, Trump postponed the planned announcement. Both CNN and NBC reported Trump was looking for ways to get out of the selection of Pence. The campaign denied the report. \"The New York Times\" alleged the Pence selection was revisited because Christie had begged the campaign to reconsider its decision and replace Pence with himself. On July 15, Trump officially announced via Twitter that he had selected Pence. Through the selection, Trump said he hoped to unify the party. Manafort said the ticket would appeal to former supporters of Sanders. As the GOP convention approached, Manafort declared the #NeverTrump movement \"gone,\" as the GOP rules committee voted not to unbind delegates. Clinton announced she would reveal her vice presidential selection after the GOP convention. \"The Washington Post\" tapped Vilsack as the favorite.\nRNC.\nAs the began in , Trump trailed Clinton in the July 18 Real Clear Politics average 40.6% to 43.8%. Although Ohio was hosting the convention, the state's delegates were not placed in the front as is tradition. This was believed to be punishment for Governor Kasich's refusal to endorse Trump or attend the convention. Manafort called Kasich's absence a \"big mistake\" and \"embarrassing [to] his state.\" With the release of the lineup of speakers showing many members of Trump's family, former RNC chairman called the convention \"a [Trump] family affair.\"\nOn the opening day, on the floor of the convention at , anti-Trump delegates unsuccessfully attempted to force a roll call vote on the convention rules. Protests outside were relatively minor with only 24 arrests throughout the entire convention. During the convention speeches, delegates frequently chanted \"Lock her up!\" in reference to Hillary Clinton. Patricia Smith, mother of diplomat who died in the , blamed Clinton for her son's death and exclaimed, \"Hillary belongs in prison. She deserves to be in stripes.\" In his speech, former New York City Rudy Giuliani commented Clinton \"would go to jail\" if he were allowed to prosecute her. In the prime-time opening-night speech, Trump's wife delivered a speech that initially received acclaim. However, this changed once the media pointed out some lines were nearly identical to those from the speech of First Lady Michelle Obama at the . \nThe Trump campaign spent most of the second day of the convention explaining away the plagiarism flap as speechwriter Meredith McIver took the blame for the passages and offered to quit. Trump requested she remain. Trump officially received the presidential nomination on the second day of the convention and Pence received the vice-presidential nomination. Christie delivered a speech in which he held a mock trial prosecuting Clinton \"in absentia\" before the delegates. He was followed with prime-time speeches by Trump's children and \nOn the third day, \"The New York Times\" released a transcript of an interview with Trump in which he criticized NATO and questioned whether the US should honor the treaty if member nations do not contribute their share of funds. Several Republicans, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, said they disagreed with Trump's comments. Disagreements seeped into the convention as well when Cruz gave a speech in which he did not endorse Trump. When his refusal became evident, a chorus of boos erupted from the delegates, continuing until he left the stage. The speech overshadowed that of Pence who accepted the vice-presidential nomination later that night. Cruz received almost universal condemnation from prominent Republicans. However, Gingrich, who spoke after Trump's son , who followed Cruz, commented he did not take the speech to show a lack of support for Trump. Manafort and Donald Trump Jr. claimed it had helped Republicans unite behind Trump. \nOn the last day of the convention, after a formal introduction from Ivanka, Trump accepted the GOP nomination and delivered, CNN noted, the longest nominee acceptance speech in 40 years. In the speech, Trump emphasized \"law and order\", and referenced his proposals of building a wall along the southern border and banning immigration from nations with a history of terrorism. Trump described the legacy of his opponent Clinton as one of \"death, destruction, terrorism, and weakness.\" President Barack Obama criticized the speech, accusing Trump of basing it on fear and inaccurately painting a bleak portrait of the nation. Nevertheless, a CNN/ORC instant poll showed 57% of respondents who watched the speech received it favorably and 56% were more likely to vote for Trump. According to pundit , the speech and overall convention provided the GOP with about a 5.9% bounce in the polls, one point higher than the average. Most polls at this time showed Trump leading Clinton. \nA day after the convention, Clinton announced her vice-presidential selection. \"The New York Times\" had reported that Clinton's husband, former President Bill Clinton, wanted Clinton to pick Senator Tim Kaine. Indeed, she named Kaine, a centrist from Virginia, as her running mate. Republican National Committee Chairman called Clinton-Kaine a \"failed Democrat status quo\" ticket.\nDNC.\nAhead of the in , Pennsylvania, \"Wikileaks\" released nearly 20 thousand hacked (DNC) e-mails. The e-mails showed favoritism of Clinton within the DNC and revealed plans to diminish the Sanders campaign. DNC Chairwoman resigned her position as a result. Initially, she was to gavel-in the convention, but after a highly negative reception from her home state Florida delegation before the convention, she was replaced with DNC Secretary . Media reports and the Clinton campaign itself blamed Russia for the hacking and leaking of e-mails. The DNC issued an apology to Sanders. Sanders urged his supporters not to protest on the floor of the convention. He was booed upon reiterating his support for Clinton before a group of delegates. Presumptive Green Party presidential nominee invited Sanders to meet with her, but Sanders declined. Via Twitter, Trump said Sanders had \"sold out.\" \nOn the first day of the convention, the first speakers received boos upon mentioning Clinton with the crowd erupting into chants of \"Bernie! Bernie!\" and \"Count our votes!\" As the convention continued, the protests died down inside , but continued outside. Overall, a total of 103 citations were issued in lieu of arrests, while the arrested eleven. As the convention moved along, commentators oddly noted a common theme of \"\" in speeches and more religious references than at the RNC. On the first night, Michelle Obama addressed the convention in a well received speech. She did not mention Trump by name, but referenced his slogan in proclaiming, \"don't let anyone ever tell you that this country isn't great, that somehow we need to make it great again. Because this right now is the greatest country on earth!\" She heaped praise upon Clinton, whom she called a leader \"guided every day by the love and hope and impossibly big dreams that we all have for our children.\" She was followed by the keynote speaker Elizabeth Warren, who opened a blistering attack on Trump, accusing him of defrauding people. Sanders spoke. He expressed disappointment in the outcome of the primaries but heralded the \"historical accomplishments\" of his movement and urged his followers to get behind Clinton. \nIn a historic moment on the second day, Clinton officially received the Democratic presidential nomination, making her the first woman to be nominated by a major party. That night, her husband, former President Bill Clinton, addressed the convention, discussing his relationship with his wife and highlighting her accomplishments. Before the convention convened on the third day, Trump held a press conference. Referencing the DNC hack leak, he remarked, \"Russia, if you're listening, I hope you're able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing.\" The Clinton campaign attacked Trump for \"actively encourag[ing] a foreign power to conduct espionage against his political opponent,\" though Trump claimed he was merely joking. \"Wikileaks\" founder commented in an interview that he timed the release of the hacked e-mails to hurt Clinton in the election.\nOn the third day, after a speech from Vice President Joe Biden, former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, an independent, addressed the convention. He formally endorsed Clinton and referred to Trump as a \"con,\" arguing, \"[t]he richest thing about Trump is his hypocrisy.\" Later, Kaine officially accepted the vice-presidential nomination. President Obama followed with a speech to wrap up the third day. He argued that no one, himself included, was \"more qualified than Hillary Clinton to serve as president of the United States of America.\" He accused Trump of offering \"no serious solutions to pressing problems \u2014 just the fanning of resentment, and blame, and anger, and hate.\"\nOn the final day, spoke and introduced her mother, Hillary Clinton, who accepted the Democratic nomination. During her speech, Clinton laid out policy proposals and attacked Trump for making some of his products overseas. In addition, she argued that Trump cannot be trusted with . Clinton's speech was deemed a success. A CNN instant poll revealed 71% of viewers had a favorable opinion of the speech with 60% more likely to vote for her after watching. Although Trump's speech received higher television ratings, Clinton overtook Trump in post-convention polls. \nPress coverage of Clinton's speech was overshadowed by an earlier speech from , a couple whose son died in Iraq in 2004. The speech set off a back-and-forth between Trump and Khan that lasted several days. With his wife at his side on the convention stage, Khizr Khan delivered a stinging attack on Trump for his earlier proposal to ban Muslim immigration and wondered whether Trump had ever read the . Trump responded, attacking Khizr for his comments and questioning whether Khizr's wife remained silent during the speech because she was not allowed to speak. Trump's comments were condemned by Democrats and Republicans alike. Khizr labeled Trump \"void of decency\" and accused him of having a \"dark heart.\" Ghazala responded with an op-ed in \"The Washington Post\" in which she attributed her silence at the convention to grief. \nAs July came to a close, Trump had additional setbacks. First, he mistakenly asserted that no Russian troops were currently in Ukraine. Second, he made an unsupported claim that the NFL had complained to him about the presidential debate schedule coinciding with NFL games. Nevertheless, Trump received some positive news with the announcement that Julian Assange had \"extremely interesting\" information on Clinton that had yet to be released through \"Wikileaks\". In the July 31 Real Clear Politics average, Clinton, who had just received the endorsement of billionaire , held a 1.1% lead over Trump .\nReform Party race features two Wikinews interviewees.\nTwo candidates who each previously spoke with \"Wikinews\" have both announced their candidacies for the 2016 presidential nomination of the Reform Party of the United States. Historian and businessman each decided to seek the nomination in July. Both have previously run for president as Democrats.\nRichardson, a veteran of politics, sought the Democratic Party\u2019s presidential nomination in 2012 and briefly vied for the Reform Party presidential nomination that same year. He is the author of \"The Others\" anthology, covering third-party candidates, and has written books on such political topics as the and the presidential candidacies of , , and recently, Bernie Sanders. He served as campaign manager during McCarthy's . In addition, he ran for Pennsylvania in 1980, and was the Consumer Party's 1988 nominee for U.S. Senate in Pennsylvania. In 2010, he ran for as the running mate of gubernatorial candidate .\nRichardson has a history within the Reform Party beyond his 2012 run. He participated in the party's 1996 and 2000 mail-in primaries, was part of the 2004 nominating conference calls, donated to candidates nominated by the party, and contributed to the Reform National Committee. Richardson says Reform Party Secretary Nicholas Hensley encouraged him to enter the 2016 race. As the nominee, he plans to spread the party message through television, radio, and speaking engagements. \n\"In short, my candidacy is designed to remind older folks about the Reform Party\u2019s important role in American politics\", says Richardson, \"and to inform younger millennials \u2014 those facing a low-paying, if not jobless, future \u2014 that there was and is a party that was opposed to , , the and other unfair trade agreements and which is still deeply committed to the idea of protecting U.S. jobs and industry as we proceed into the 21st Century.\" \nDe La Fuente, a businessman with properties throughout the world, got his start in the automobile industry and has since branched into the banking and real estate markets. Before his 2016 Democratic Party campaign for president, he had not sought political office, but did serve as the first-ever , at the . During his 2016 presidential campaign, which he began largely as a reaction to the presidential campaign of Donald Trump, De La Fuente qualified for the ballot in 48 Democratic primary contests. In addition to seeking the Reform Party nomination, he is current attempting to qualify for the general election ballot in several states as an independent or as the nominee of the new \"American Delta Party,\" which he founded. De La Fuente is currently running in the Democratic Party primary for U.S. Senate in Florida as well. According to Hensley, in remarks to \"Wikinews\", ballot access expert encouraged De La Fuente to seek the Reform Party nomination.\nAccording to Richardson, De La Fuente entered the race a mere 24 hours after he did. Moreover, Richardson distinguishes himself from De La Fuente, arguing that while those within the Reform party encouraged him to run, De La Fuente ran at the insistence of \"a partisan Libertarian [Winger] [...] who personally has little interest in the Reform Party's current fortunes or its future\", and who sees the Reform Party as \"just an available ballot line\".\nRichardson's preferred running mate, activist Thomas Knapp, founder of the now-defunct , draws an even greater contrast between Richardson and De La Fuente. \n\"[There were] five states that both Mr. [De La] Fuente [in 2016] and Mr. Richardson [in 2012] appeared on a Democratic primary ballot [in different election cycles] [...],\" explains Knapp, comparing De La Fuente and Richardson's Democratic Party candidacies, \"Richardson outpolled [De La] Fuente and did so on a budget two full orders of magnitude smaller, even though Richardson was running against a popular incumbent president [Barack Obama] and [De La] Fuente was running against one of the most hated politicians in America [Hillary Clinton].\" \n\"In his presidential campaign so far [De La Fuente] has spent $6.4 million to get 67,000 votes\", Knapp continues. \"That's $95.50 per vote.\"\nDe La Fuente was asked to respond to these statements and to comment on this report, but he has yet to do so.\nThe Reform Party was founded in 1995 by industrialist . Perot ran as the party's first presidential nominee in , and won over eight percent of the popular vote, the highest percentage for a third-party candidate since. In 1998, professional wrestler ran on the Reform Party ticket and was elected . The party fell in prominence during the lead-up to the when it was plagued by infighting between ideological factions. In 2000, Donald Trump briefly sought the party's presidential nomination, but it was ultimately won by icon , who went on to receive only 0.4% of the popular vote in the general election. In , the party opted to endorse consumer advocate , but ended the year nearly bankrupt. won the party's 2008 presidential nomination, but appeared on the ballot in only one state and won a total of 481 votes. In 2012, the party's presidential nominee, fitness model Andre Barnett, on the ballot only in Florida with write-in status elsewhere, received a total of 952 votes. The party is currently on the ballot in New York and Florida, but, according to \"Ballot Access News\", the New York affiliate is expected to nominate Trump. \nThe party held its 2016 convention the last weekend in July. It had planned to formally announce its presidential ticket on August 8. According to Knapp, Richardson and De La Fuente were the two leading contenders for the nomination. Others seeking the nomination included 2012 vice presidential nominee Kenneth Cross and psychologist Lynn Kahn.\n\"I was approached about entering the contest very recently\", says Richardson. \"I plan to support whatever ticket the party nominates.\"\nFormer Congressman responds to Cruz RNC speech.\nAs Senator Ted Cruz delivered his much-discussed speech before the Republican National Convention, former Congressman Tom Tancredo, an early supporter of , watched with disappointment. In an exclusive interview with \"Wikinews\", Tancredo argued that Cruz's refusal to endorse Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump during the speech, which prompted what was perhaps one of the most negative crowd reactions to a convention speech in recent memory, was a mistake. \n\"He needs to realize and appreciate the bigger picture\", said Tancredo about Cruz, \"[y]ou can still hate Donald Trump for the things he says [but] he has to recognize what will happen to the country if the Supreme Court is under the control of Hillary Clinton.\"\nTancredo, who represented from 1999 to 2009, endorsed Cruz in January, writing an op-ed for in which he touted Cruz as an outsider and \"the real deal.\" Tancredo himself ran for president in 2008 as an outsider Republican, focusing on securing the and enforcing laws against illegal immigration. Notably, during his , Tancredo had a September 2007 interview with \"Wikinews\".\nCruz's speech affected more than just Tancredo's opinion. Though some praised the speech as principled and politically astute \u2014 including Hillary Clinton, who tweeted \"vote your conscience\", repeating what Cruz had said \u2014 many prominent Republicans offered rebukes. Former Congressman called for a Texas Republican to \"primary\" Cruz in 2018, when his Senate seat goes up for re-election, as a consequence for not honoring the GOP endorsement pledge. Chris Christie described Cruz as \"selfish\" for refusing to endorse. Congressman called Cruz an \"asshole\", a term which RNC spokesman Sean Spicer said was apt. Polls from before and after the speech showed Cruz's approval rating among Republicans fall from 60% to 33%.\nAddressing the backlash, Cruz defended his decision, arguing \"I am not in the habit of supporting people who attack my wife and attack my father.\" Moreover, he claimed the GOP endorsement pledge \"was not a blanket commitment that, if you go and slander and attack [his wife], that I'm going to nonetheless come like a servile puppy dog and say thank you very much for maligning my wife and my father\".\nThe attacks Cruz refers to are Trump's re-tweeting in March of a graphic comparing an unflattering photo of Cruz's wife, Heidi, to a glamour shot of Melania Trump, as well as Trump's mention last May of a \"\" report connecting to , assassin of President .\nTancredo said he believes the issues facing the nation are \"more important than [Cruz's] personal feelings about his wife or father.\" He maintained that Cruz \"could have avoided the problem and 'lived with himself' by passing on the invitation to speak. Apparently the few minutes still in the spotlight was too alluring\".\nA new view on Cruz was not Tancredo's only takeaway from July's convention. He appreciated Trump's acceptance speech as well, calling it the \"[b]est I've heard from him\".\nWikinews interviews history-making DNC speaker.\nBefore Hillary Clinton's historic moment on the fourth day of the Democratic National Convention, as she became the first woman to accept the presidential nomination of a major US political party, another woman, much younger than Clinton, made history of her own. , national press secretary for the (HRC), became the first openly person to address a major political party's national convention when she spoke before the Democratic National Convention. \"Wikinews\" contacted McBride to find out more about her groundbreaking speech. \nMcBride, a native of Delaware in her mid-20s, came out as a transgender woman during her term at as student body president. Before HRC, an LGBT lobbying group, McBride was employed by the , a progressive advocacy organization, and was the first openly transgender woman to at the .

It features original material compiled throughout the previous month after an overview of the month's biggest stories.\nIn this month's edition on the campaign trail: the vice presidential nominee of the Reform Party is revealed; those attacked in a high profile campaign speech respond; and \"Wikinews\" interviews an economist seeking the presidency a second time.\nSummary.\nAs the campaign entered into August, presidential nominee Hillary Clinton maintained her lead over presidential nominee Donald Trump in the head-to-head average. The August 1 aggregate showed Clinton ahead 45.9% to 42.0%. With the Libertarian Party presidential nominee Gary Johnson and Green Party presumptive presidential nominee included, Clinton led Trump 41.4% to 38.8% with Johnson at 7.0% and Stein at 3.2%. As of August, Stein, who won the Green Party presidential nomination at the party's early-August , and Johnson had achieved enough ballot access to theoretically win a majority of the votes in the electoral college. nominee would also reach the threshold if write-in access were counted. Still, others pushed candidacies. Former officer and former Republican policy director received mainstream media attention for his entrance into the race in early August as a alternative to Trump. However, McMullin's late entry meant he could not meet the ballot access filing deadline in at least 20 states. Former Democratic presidential candidate , himself making a push to appear on ballots in multiple states as an independent, received the presidential nomination of the Reform Party on August 9. The , on the ballot in , picked , nominee of the , as their presidential nominee. Another California ballot-qualified third party, the , gave their nomination to Donald Trump.\nThough Trump's poll numbers dipped in early August, his fundraising improved, particularly in \"small dollar\" donations. In addition, in a show of party unity he endorsed the Republican primary candidacies of Paul Ryan as well as John McCain and . Yet, there remained some division within the Republican Party. In a \"Washington Post\"/ poll, only 74% of voters who supported Trump's rivals in the primaries now backed Trump. Several prominent members, including former Commerce Secretary and Deputy Secretary of Defense , said they would probably vote for Clinton. Congressman of Virginia endorsed Gary Johnson, and 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney, who was considering endorsing Johnson, was offered a position in a future Johnson administration. On the other hand, Democrats remained largely united with 86% of Senator Bernie Sanders' former supporters backing Clinton. Nevertheless, August was also a tough month for Clinton. Fresh off a ' interview in which she claimed, counter to the facts, that FBI director had called her testimony about her private e-mail servers \"truthful,\" Clinton claimed in a later interview she \"may have short-circuited.\" The campaign then took a somewhat morbid turn. Via , Trump questioned whether the hacking of Clinton's e-mails led to the execution of an Iranian scientist. Seddique Mateen, father of the nightclub shooter who killed 49 in May, was spotted behind Clinton at a campaign rally. The campaign claimed it was unaware. Moreover, the mysterious death of a DNC (Democratic National Committee) staffer led ' to offer 20,000 for information related to the death, prompting media speculation over whether the deceased staffer was involved in the leak of internal DNC e-mails showing anti-Sanders bias, which \"Wikileaks\" released just before the Democratic National Convention. The theme continued as some felt Trump's remarks suggested the assassination of Clinton. Trump said, \"if [Clinton] gets to pick [Supreme Court] judges, nothing you can do folks ... though [with] the second amendment, folks, maybe there is\". Clinton's campaign manager labeled the comment as \"dangerous.\" Clinton's running mate said he \"couldn't believe\" Trump made the comment and labeled him a \"complete temperamental misfit.\" MSNBC host , with whom Trump engaged in a feud, claimed \"a bloody line has been crossed.\" Trump blamed the media for its coverage of the statement and clarified that he had meant supporters of the second amendment should organize and vote. CNN claimed the contacted the Trump campaign to discuss the statement. The Trump campaign and a government official both denied any such discussion occurred. Thereafter, Trump continued making provocative statements, branding President Barack Obama as the \"founder of \" and saying he would only lose the election \"if it's rigged.\" Trump's running mate released his tax records, but Trump did not. Trump's attorney said he would not allow Trump to release his records until an audit was complete. Clinton and Kaine both released their tax records.\nIn mid-August, a shakeup in the Trump campaign led to the demotion of campaign manger after reports Manafort routed secret cash payments from powerful individuals in Ukraine and Russia while working on the campaign of the pro-Russian former Ukrainian President . Manafort would later leave the campaign entirely. Pollster was named the new campaign manager with , head of , named campaign CEO. , who was fired as CEO of in a sexual harassment scandal, joined the campaign as an adviser. According to \"The Washington Post\", the shakeup was meant to focus more on holding large campaign rallies and attacking Clinton in a more aggressive manner. Trump held such a rally in in which he attempted to appeal to African-Americans and touting his message of \"law and order.\" Moreover, attacks on Clinton seemingly increased. Congressional Republicans upped efforts to convince the Justice Department to charge Clinton with perjury for her statements in testimony about her private e-mail servers and the classified nature of e-mails. Trump intensified attacks the , accusing Clinton of using it to make money from selling access and favors as Secretary of State. The Foundation announced it would cease accepting foreign donations if Clinton were elected. Clinton's health was also raised as an issue. Trump spokeswoman claimed Clinton suffers from , falls, and serious brain damage. Former Trump adviser said \"Clinton can barely stand up.\" On the campaign trail, Trump attacked Clinton as \"one of the greatest liars of all time\" but he took a slightly different tone on other matters. He expressed regret for instances \"in heat of debate\" in which he had said things that caused \"personal pain.\" Through a press release, Clinton attacked the statement as simply a \"well-written phrase\" from Trump's speechwriter. In the wake of in Louisiana, Trump visited the state to survey damage. This preceded President Obama, who was vacationing at the time. Former Democratic Senator thanked Trump for the visit. Back on the campaign trail, at a rally, Trump addressed black voters about supporting his campaign, asking \"what the hell do you have to lose?\" \nWith new e-mails released from Clinton's term as Secretary of State, Trump called for appointment of a special prosecutor to investigate claims of misdeeds involving the Clinton Foundation. He called the foundation the \"most corrupt enterprise in political history\" and argued the media was protecting Clinton. Former Secretary of State , whom Clinton claimed advised her about using a private server for official e-mails, confirmed he advised her but that at the time she was already using a private server. Concerning the e-mail server, Clinton argued \"it can sound like I'm trying to excuse what I did, and there are no excuses.\" After the Associated Press revealed that roughly half of the non-government individuals Clinton met with as Secretary of State were donors to the Clinton Foundation, Clinton rejected claims of outside influence. She commented that \"there's a lot of smoke\" regarding the connections but \"no fire.\" In late August, Clinton launched an attack on Trump's connections to the so-called \".\" In a speech in , Nevada focused on the matter, Clinton accused Trump of \"reinforcing harmful stereotypes and offering a dog whistle to his most hateful supporters.\" She painted Trump and members of the Alt-right as racists and peddlers of conspiracy theories. The campaign ran an ad linking Trump to the and Tim Kaine accused Trump of espousing \"Ku Klux Klan values.\" Trump denied the charges of racism. He tweeted that African Americans and Hispanics should support him because of his plans to combat poverty and crime, and improve education. Meanwhile, media coverage and inconsistent statements from Trump and his campaign led to speculation Trump was shifting his tough stance on immigration. He maintained he would build a wall as president, but rather than deport all illegal immigrants, he said he would distinguish the \"bad\" ones. In an interview with , Trump said he was not proposing amnesty, rather illegal immigrants would not become citizens and would need to pay back taxes to remain. Reporter claimed Trump's \"dramatic change on immigration\" was the result of Trump realizing \"he'll lose the Latino vote and the White House.\" Trump supporters, such as conservative author and Congressman , expressed hostility to Trump's changing position. On CNN, Trump claimed that under his immigration plan, there would not be a \"path to legalization unless [the illegal immigrants] leave the country and come back.\" Trump visited Mexico at the end of the month and held a joint press conference with Mexican President . Pe\u00f1a Nieto claimed he had told Trump at the beginning of the meeting that Mexico would not pay for the wall along the as Trump proposed. Trump claimed the wall was not discussed. Clinton accused Trump of \"choking\" and \"lying.\" Nevertheless, the visit was well received. Trump critic , editor of the \"\", said the trip demonstrated \"tactical agility and operational competence\" from the Trump campaign. After returning from Mexico, Trump delivered a speech in in what ABC News described as an \"anger-tinged speech\" that landed Trump \"back where he started on immigration.\" In the August 31 four-way RealClearPolitics Average, Clinton led with 42.3% followed by Trump with 38.2%, Johnson with 7.7% and Stein with 3.0%.\nReform Party vice presidential nominee confirmed.\nWhen the Reform Party announced, via Facebook, that it nominated businessman Rocky De La Fuente of Florida for president, nothing was said about the party's vice presidential nomination. Nevertheless, in states in which De La Fuente petitioned to appear on the general election ballot as an independent, he listed his running mate as , a , Florida attorney specializing in and veterans benefits, who, like De La Fuente, ran for the Democratic Party's 2016 presidential nomination. \"Wikinews\" contacted leaders of the Reform Party and confirmed that Steinberg is, in fact, the party's official vice presidential nominee.\nDe La Fuente and Steinberg were both at the 2016 Lesser-Known Candidates Forum held at last January just before the . De La Fuente spoke of his success in securing a ballot spot in at least 30 Democratic contests. Steinberg expressed admiration for De La Fuente's feat. He readily threw his support behind De La Fuente and urged the other candidates to do so as well. \n\"If you really want to shake things up,\" said Steinberg during the forum, \"every single one of us says we support Rocky De La Fuente, and I don't even know the guy, but I do know he's a multi-millionaire, he has property in many different states, he can afford to run a campaign [...] I think that's what it's going to take, is an outsider. You know, when in , he shook things up. And maybe that's what it takes, for all of us to say, let's take one of us who is on the ballot in 30 states, and maybe gonna be on the ballot in 50 states, and let's support him, and maybe he'll take all of our ideas and we'll work as a team and we'll be the lesser-known candidates for president.\" \nSeven months later Steinberg is the running mate of De La Fuente and the vice presidential nominee of the party Ross Perot founded.\nEven though no separate vote was held, both Reform Party national chairman and national secretary Nicholas Hensley say Steinberg, as De La Fuente's choice, became the vice presidential nominee when De La Fuente defeated historian Darcy Richardson for the presidential nomination, five votes to four. Collison explains that the party \"opted to vote for a slate\". Furthermore, it cannot \"force the candidate to place the same VP on the ballot in states where they run as an independent.\"\nThe Reform Party has furnished ballot access for the De La Fuente\u2013Steinberg ticket in Florida and Louisiana. Additionally, independent ballot access has been obtained or is in the process of being obtained in multiple other states. have impeded ballot access in certain states since De La Fuente and Steinberg ran in Democratic primaries. However, the ticket expects to be on the ballot in at least 20 states.\nAlt-rightists respond to Clinton speech.\nDemocratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton's August speech attacking a subset of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump's supporters, the so-called \"Alt-right,\" sought to connect Trump to those she accused of spreading conspiracy theories, and promoting racism, anti-semitism, nationalism, and white supremacy. In the speech, Clinton identified several individuals, chronicled their alleged misdeeds, and described their associations with Trump. Among the well-known individuals she mentioned were head Stephen Bannon, who was recently hired as CEO of Trump's campaign; radio host and \"Infowars\" owner , a supporter of Trump; and former Ku Klux Klan , a candidate for U.S. Senate in Louisiana and supporter of Trump, whose support Trump has disavowed. Clinton alluded to others such as a Twitter user with the handle \"White-Genocide-TM\", whom Trump retweeted, and a \"prominent white nationalist leader\" who was listed as a Trump delegate in California before resigning from the position. \"Wikinews\" reached out to these latter two to get their reaction to Clinton's remarks.\nOn Twitter, \"Wikinews\" contacted \"White-Genocide-TM\" who used the screen name \"Donald Trumpovitz\" with a profile portrait of the late , founder of the , and a listed location of \"Jewmerica.\" The phrase \",\" coined by white nationalist Bob Whitaker, the 's former 2016 presidential nominee, refers to the dwindling percentage of whites in the U.S. population. \"White Genocide-TM\" received media coverage last January when Trump retweeted an image the user posted of then-Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush photoshopped outside with a cardboard sign reading \"Vote Trump.\" In his retweet, Trump added, \"Poor Jeb. I could've sworn I saw him outside Trump Tower the other day!\"\nThrough a direct message, \"Wikinews\" asked \"White-Genocide-TM\" to respond to Clinton's description of him as a \"fringe bigot with a few dozen followers\". He responded, \"It was definitely not a dozen [followers], . . . 2300 followers or so.\" Before \"Wikinews\" could complete the interview, Twitter suspended the \"White-Genocide-TM\" account. No indication has been given as to why Twitter suspended the account. According to an information page on Twitter, accounts are suspended for violating the listed Twitter rules.\n\"Wikinews\" was able to get a full response to the speech from , the man Clinton referred to, without naming, as a \"prominent white nationalist leader.\" It was Johnson who resigned his position as a California delegate last May following media reports on his selection. He is currently chairman of the aforementioned American Freedom Party, which is actively supporting Trump. \nJohnson said Clinton's speech was an \"ineffectual\" attack on Trump and actually had the effect of mainstreaming himself and the white nationalist movement. \n\"Hillary Clinton and the globalist establishment have excessively tried to smear too many people, groups and ideologies with guilt by the association with the alt-Right movement so that white racial awareness and promotion is, in fact, becoming rehabilitated\", argued Johnson via e-mail. \"We in the alt-Right movement see opportunities that have never before been presented to us.\"\nJohnson said he planned to present himself and others in the alt-right, including former Congressman Virgil Goode, the Constitution Party's 2012 presidential nominee, \"\" founder , and evolutionary psychologist , before the Trump campaign to consider for administrative positions. If successful, he believes they can help \"provide a counterbalance to globalism\u2019s destructive and dysgenic concepts of multiculturalism and diversity.\"\nWikinews interviews economist again running for president.\nIn August, economist , a professor and former senior economist of President 's , secured ballot access for his unconventional presidential campaign in Louisiana and . In addition, he plans to obtain write-in status in 41 more states. \"Wikinews\" reached out to Kotlikoff to discuss his campaign.\nKotlikoff announced his candidacy last May. He named , a professor of economics at , as his running mate. This is not Kotlikoff's first run for the presidency. In 2012, he sought the presidential nomination of , which ultimately did not field a candidate. He also briefly sought the Reform Party presidential nomination that year. During his first run, Kotlikoff spoke with \"Wikinews\" in an interview similar to the one below. In that campaign, Kotlikoff promoted the purple plan, which combined liberal and conservative economic ideas. Today, he boasts a 157 page campaign platform that reportedly took him three months to write. Some of the ideas contained in the platform include the elimination of income taxes, privatization of health care, as well as support for , drug legalization, and increases in the federal inheritance tax.\nWith \"Wikinews\", Kotlikoff discusses the prospect of his candidacy, the differences between this run and his previous run, and why voters should vote for him over the other candidates.\nWhat do you hope to achieve by running for president?\nHow does your 2016 run differ from your 2012 run?\nWhy should voters support you over the major party candidates and other third party or independent candidates?"}

It features original material compiled throughout the previous month after an overview of the month's biggest stories.\nIn this month's edition on the campaign trail: an arrest warrant is issued for the Green Party presidential and vice presidential nominees; the \"Birther King\" opens up about Donald Trump's changing view on President Obama's place of birth; and \"Wikinews\" interviews a write-in presidential candidate hoping to run the \"most libertarian\" campaign in history.\nSummary.\nAs the campaign entered September, Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton held a 4.9% advantage over Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, 46.8% to 41.9% in the head-to-head average. In a four way race, Clinton's lead over Trump shrank to 3.9%, 42.0% to 38.1% with Libertarian presidential nominee Gary Johnson at 7.6% and Green Party presidential nominee Jill Stein at 3.2%. Despite his absence from most polls, independent presidential candidate received national coverage. In early September, he received the endorsement of former U.S. who previously represented Washington as Republican. According to a campaign spokesman, McMullin's goal was to win his home state of Utah. A UtahPolicy.com poll in the state released September 12 showed McMullin at 9%, in fourth place behind Trump, Clinton, and Johnson, who himself was four points ahead of McMullin. Johnson received extensive coverage in the early part of the month for failing to recognize the critical Syrian city of when asked about it during an MSNBC interview. He was later lampooned for sticking his tongue out at a reporter during an interview and for being unable to recall the name of a world leader he admired. Nevertheless, Johnson obtained unprecedented endorsements from the ', ', the ', the ', and the '. Other publications also took unprecedented steps. Traditional Republican-backing ' endorsed Clinton. \"\", which had not previously endorsed a candidate for office, asked voters not to vote for Trump. Although Trump did not receive any major newspaper endorsements, he received the backing of the , the nation's largest police union, and touted endorsements from 88 retired generals.\nOn September 2, the released a report on Clinton's use of a private server for official e-mails. Among the revelations was that Clinton could not recall intelligence briefings during her time as due to a concussion. Questions about Clinton's health were brought to the forefront after two coughing spells. The first occurred during a speech in . While recovering, she explained, \"Every time I think about Trump I get allergic\". Shortly thereafter, during a press conference aboard an airplane, while discussing Trump's connection to Russian Vladimir Putin, Clinton began coughing profusely once again, asking a staffer for water. Trump's relation to Putin was reexamined on September 7 when both candidates attended a \"Commander-in-Chief\" forum broadcast on and hosted by . Lauer interviewed each candidate separately for 30 minutes with a focus on the military. Regarding Putin, Trump commented \"if he says great things about me, I'm going to say great things about him.\" He called Putin more of a leader than President Barack Obama, under whose leadership, Trump claimed, \"the generals have been reduced to rubble.\" Lauer's performance in the forum was panned in \"The New York Times\" and other media for his purported leniency on Trump, lack of knowledge, and stricter treatment of Clinton, with whom he heavily discussed the e-mail scandal. Trump's running mate agreed with Trump's assessment of Putin, claiming it \"inarguable\" that Putin \"has been a stronger leader in his country\" than President Obama has been in the United States. Broadcast icon interviewed Trump on the Russia-owned (RT) network. The Trump campaign later claimed it did not know the interview would air on RT. For Clinton, two major developments in early to mid-September threatened to change the course of the election. First, video surfaced of a Clinton fundraiser in which she referred to half of Trump supporters as a \"basket of deplorables,\" describing them as \"racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamaphobic, you name it.\" She described some of these individuals as \"irredeemable.\" The remarks led to denunciations from both Clinton supporters and opponents. Those who felt the comments applied to them, turned \"deplorables\" into a . Trump argued the comments showed Clinton's \"true feelings\" of \"bigotry and hatred for millions of Americans.\" Clinton later expressed regret over the comments, calling them \"wrong\" and \"grossly generalistic.\" Next, while attending a ceremony commemorating the 15 year anniversary of the , with Trump in attendance as well, Clinton left early. Video from citizen journalist Zdenek Gazda showed Clinton collapse while approaching her campaign van. She was transported to the apartment of her daughter . Two hours later she emerged from the apartment to greet supporters. The campaign initially claimed the episode was the result of overheating. However, it later revealed that Clinton had been diagnosed with . \"The Washington Post\", among other publications, criticized the campaign for its handling of the situation. As Clinton took a few days off the campaign trail to recover, Trump contrasted his health during an appearance on \"\". Host reviewed a one-page record of a recent Trump physical and declared Trump to be in good health. During the appearance, Trump also discussed his new proposal, previously laid out with daughter , for changes to unemployment policy, guaranteeing \"six weeks of paid maternity leave.\"\nWith the first presidential debate in mind, Trump reportedly planned to prepare as he did for the primary debates, which he claimed to have not prepared for at all. 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney called for the inclusion of Johnson and running mate in the debate. Trump rebuffed the call, saying the debate should only feature the two candidates with a chance to win the election, meaning the exclusion of Johnson, who qualified for all ballots in September, and Stein, who had qualified for 44 state ballots plus the District of Columbia. Eventually, the officially announced Johnson and Stein both failed to meet the 15% polling threshold and so would not participate. This came as former 2016 Democratic Party presidential candidate Bernie Sanders urged progressives not to vote third party, as a poll released September 14 showed Johnson moving into second place among at 29%, slightly behind Clinton at 31% and slightly ahead of Trump at 26%. Johnson secured the endorsement of former Congressman . In the political squabbling ahead of the debate, the Clinton campaign continued to attack Trump for refusing to release his past tax records. Trump argued he would not release the records while still undergoing an IRS audit. Pence, however, did release his own personal tax records. Trump argued the media was the only group interested in his tax records. His son generated controversy when he described the media as \"warming up the gas chambers\" for his father. The Trump campaign later clarified he was not referring to gas chambers. Trump raised the issue of gun control, provocatively arguing that Clinton's bodyguards be disarmed to \"see what happens to her.\" Clinton's running mate called the remarks an \"incitement to violence.\" Next, after Clinton attacked Trump for his part in of President Obama, Trump issued a press release confirming his belief that President Obama was born in the United States. He claimed Clinton had started the birther movement in 2008, but Trump, by compelling Obama to release his long-form birth certificate in 2011, had ended it. This came as the presidential approval rating for Obama reached 58%, his highest since 2009. A release of former Secretary of State Colin Powell's hacked e-mails showed Powell calling the birther movement \"racist\" and referring to Trump as a \"national disgrace\" and \"international pariah.\" Powell's e-mails also cast Clinton negatively, saying she did not look healthy and claiming her husband was \"still dicking bimbos at home.\" Former Secretary of Defense himself weighed in on the presidential race, calling Clinton \"flawed\" but describing Trump as \"beyond repair\" and \"unfit\" for the presidency. According to \"\", Gates and Powell's ex-boss, former President George H. W. Bush, planned to cast his vote for Clinton. Trump obtained unlikely support of his own when former rival Ted Cruz endorsed his candidacy just ahead of the first debate. For debate prep, Clinton participated in mock debates for four days prior while Trump did very little preparation, setting aside the last day to discuss ideas with his team. \"The New York Times\" summed up Clinton's goal at the debate as unnerving Trump and catching him in a lie. It described Trump's goal as sticking to his instincts.\nAs the September 26 presidential debate approached, in a move meant to rattle Trump, Clinton invited supporter and billionaire to attend the debate. In response, Trump threatened to invite , an alleged ex-mistress of Bill Clinton. Pence later clarified Flowers would not attend the debate. Cuban, on the other hand, did attend. Overall during the debate, which of NBC moderated, by website 's count, Trump interrupted Clinton three times, with 24 \"fleeting\" interjections; Clinton did not interrupt Trump at all, but had five \"fleeting\" interjections. Notably, Trump attacked Clinton repeatedly for being in power for \"30 years\" and yet not fulfilling any of her policy goals. For example, he accused Clinton of \"fighting ISIS [her] entire adult life.\" Clinton, on the other hand, accused Trump of making false statements and called on \"fact checkers\" to \"get to work.\" She jokingly said \"I have a feeling by the end of this debate I'll be blamed for everything,\" to which Trump interjected \"Why not?\" When the tax issue was raised, Trump argued he would release his records once Clinton \"releases her 33,000 e-mails that have been deleted.\" Clinton discussed decades-old tax records from Trump, showing he had not paid any federal income taxes. Trump responded, \"That makes me smart.\" After Trump attacked Clinton's decision for taking time off the campaign trail prior to the debate, Clinton observed \"I think Donald just criticized me for preparing for this debate. And, yes, I did. And you know what else I prepared for? I prepared to be president.\" At the conclusion, Clinton mentioned , a former whom Trump allegedly referred to as \"Miss Piggy\" and \"Miss Housekeeping.\" Trump countered he was going to bring up something \"extremely rough\" about Clinton but restrained himself. This was later said to be about Bill Clinton's extramarital affairs, which Trump said he did not raise due to the presence of Clinton's daughter Chelsea, a friend of Trump's daughter . After the debate, Trump took the extraordinary step of entering the media . Analysts largely agreed Clinton won the debate. 16 out of 22 participants in pollster 's focus group came to that conclusion, as did 18 of 20 participants in a CNN focus group. 's post debate instant poll showed Clinton winning the debate 51% to 40%. CNN's poll showed a 62% to 27% margin for Clinton. Trump's sniffing during the debate led former Vermont governor to suggest Trump was using . The next day, Trump blamed the sniffing on a defective microphone. While appearing on , he also addressed Machado, calling her the \"worst\" Miss Universe and arguing \"she gained a massive amount of weight, and it was a real problem.\" Afterwards, Trump launched a 3 a.m. attack on Machado, labeling her \"disgusting\" and asking his readers to \"check out [her] sex tape.\" Clinton described the tweets as \"unhinged, even for him.\" Trump argued \"at least you know I will be there, awake, to answer the call!\" Former Republican Senator closed out the month with an endorsement of Clinton. In the RealClearPolitics average, Clinton led Trump 47.5% to 44.4% in the head-to-head, a margin of 3.1%. In the four-way race, Clinton's lead fell to 2.9%, 43.8% to 40.9%, with Johnson at 7.3% and Stein at 2.4%.\nArrest warrant out for Green Party nominees.\nWhile most coverage of third party candidates in September centered around the gaffes of Libertarian presidential nominee Gary Johnson, Green Party presidential nominee Jill Stein received coverage over a protest she and running mate participated in, leading to a warrant for their arrests in North Dakota. \nAccording to a witness affidavit, on the morning of September 6, authorities in , North Dakota were alerted to protests at the site of construction of the , a proposed 1,000 -long pipeline slated to carry about a half million of from oil-rich North Dakota to Illinois. The pipeline is controversial due to its planned construction route under the , disturbing sacred burial grounds and potentially contaminating the water supply. Protests have been ongoing since April and the project has become the subject of litigation, though it has been largely ignored in the presidential election. During the September 6 protest, demonstrators allegedly spray-painted graffiti on bulldozers, cut wires, flattened tires, and soiled gas tanks. After video surfaced of Baraka spray-painting \"decolonization\" and Stein spray-painting \"I approve this message\" on bulldozers, the authorities had requisite probable cause to tie the vandalism directly to Stein and Baraka. In an arrest warrant issued on September 7, officials charged both Stein and Baraka with criminal trespass and criminal mischief, Class B . \nAfter learning of the arrest warrant, in a statement released on their campaign website, Stein and Baraka called on the authorities to pursue the \"real vandalism\" committed by the pipe constructors, whom they accused of \"bulldozing [...] sacred burial sites and [...] unleashing [...] vicious attack dogs.\" Stein told the \"Chicago Tribune\" she planned to turn herself over to Morton County officials at some point, but as of the end of September, she had not. Her list of scheduled campaign events for the remainder of October does not bring her to North Dakota or anywhere near. Donnell Hushka of the told \"Wikinews\" that because the charge is only a misdemeanor, authorities cannot execute the warrant outside the state of North Dakota. The maximum penalty for a Class B misdemeanor in North Dakota is 30 days in jail and a fine of 1,000.\nThis would not be the first time Stein has had a run-in with the law. During her 2012 presidential campaign, Stein was arrested on three different occasions, most notably for trespassing at the presidential debate for which she did not qualify. This cycle, Stein attempted to attend the September 26 presidential debate at , but was escorted off campus before she could be arrested.\nOn the same day the arrest warrant was issued, Stein's petition to appear on the ballot in North Dakota was deemed valid. It is one of the 44 states, plus the District of Columbia, where she will appear on the general election ballot.\n\"Wikinews\" contacted the Stein campaign about this report but did not receive a response.\n'Birther King' reacts to Trump's change of heart.\nAfter attacks from Hillary Clinton painting Donald Trump as a racist conspiracy theorist for his role in the birther movement, Donald Trump disavowed the movement on September 16, asserting \"President Barack Obama was born in the United States. Period.\" Through a press release, the campaign connected the origins of the birther movement to Clinton's against then-Senator Obama for the Democratic Party presidential nomination. However, the rumors actually go back to Obama's against former ambassador . At the time, Andy Martin, a perennial candidate for political office and vexatious litigant, sent out a press release questioning Obama's background. In the years that followed, rumors spread across the Internet, morphing into the theory that Obama was actually born in Kenya, which peaked during the . Trump reignited the controversy in 2011, while considering a run for president. Increased interest resulted in Obama's release of his long-form birth certificate in 2011, but Trump, who ended up not running for another four years, continued to question its authenticity \u2014 that is, until now. With Trump's change of heart, \"Wikinews\" sought out Martin, the man who refers to himself as the \"Birther King\" and \"founder\" of the birther movement.\nThe origins of the birther movement are somewhat murky. According to \"The New York Times\", Martin is \"widely credited\" with starting the \"whisper campaign\" that morphed into the movement, beginning with an August 2004 press release on claiming Obama was a secret . Although, Martin recalls, he never espoused the Kenyan birth theory, he sued for the release of the long form certificate in in 2008. After which, \"crazies took over the movement and proposed increasingly irrational and unfounded claims Obama was born in Kenya.\"\n\"Everybody uses my research as a takeoff point,\" Martin told \"The Times\" in 2008, \"and exaggerate them to suit their own fantasies.\"\nMartin first spoke to \"Wikinews\" in August 2011 when he was running for the Republican Party's 2012 presidential nomination. In the interview, Martin expressed his belief, based on a research trip to Hawaii, that Obama's real father was not Kenyan economist but Hawaii-based journalist and labor activist . This theory has not caught on as persistently among birthers as the Kenyan birth. Martin discussed Trump during the interview, describing him as \"not serious\" and saying his foray into presidential politics and the birther movement looked like a \"charade.\"\nMartin's opinion of Trump seems to have since changed in five years. After Martin launched another run for the Republican presidential nomination in 2016, he soon began praising Trump and using his campaign slogan \"Make America Great Again\" on press releases. He entered the primary this year and received about 200 votes (0.07%), the highest among lesser-known candidates and more even than former governor who was still in the race at the time. Months later, Martin officially endorsed Trump for president.\nAs for Trump's change of heart, Martin says by \"clos[ing] the book\" Trump handled criticism from Clinton about birtherism well. He says Clinton's attacks are \"desperate and counterproductive\" and argues the issue is \"almost certainly going to boomerang on Clinton.\" Although he disputes Trump's claim the Clinton campaign actually started the birther movement, he says the Clinton campaign \"clearly tried in 2008 to fuel the Birther controversy by trying to focus media attention on Obama's place of birth.\"\nMartin sent out a press release on September 18 promoting what he called the \"last birther news conference.\" Despite his desire to put the issue to rest, Martin sees it as unlikely, arguing that Obama and Clinton continue to add \"new fuel to the fire.\"\n\"Obama fed the Birther movement because he has shamelessly use[d] Birther catnip to irritate and frustrate the right\", says Martin, but \"Obama and Clinton have been grievously wrong in believing the Birther controversy helps them. It harmed Obama, and it has harmed the nation, and it will not help Clinton during the presidential election.\"\n\"Wikinews\" interviews libertarian write-in candidate.\nOn September 29, writer and former 2016 Libertarian Party (LP) presidential candidate , the newly-elected chair of the (LPNH), announced the creation of a write-in campaign for president across several states. In a press release, he stated three goals for his run: \"(1) to run the most libertarian presidential campaign in history; (2) to proclaim the ideas of liberty as boldly and as often as possible; and (3) to give as many people as possible the opportunity to vote for an actual libertarian in November.\" \"Wikinews\" reached out to Perry to discuss the campaign.\nDuring his run for the Libertarian nomination, Perry notably refused to file with the Federal Election Commission, claiming it lacked authority, and said he would only take donations in the form of precious metals or like . He selected Muslim libertarian Will Coley as his running mate. At the , Perry received 6.8% on the first ballot and 5.6% on the second ballot, fourth place each time. After being eliminated, Perry delivered a boisterous concession speech in which he warned the party about following the path of the in accepting public campaign financing. He did not endorse the Johnson\u2013Weld ticket.\nLibertarians like Perry have expressed displeasure in Johnson\u2013Weld, arguing the ticket has sacrificed principles for mainstream acceptance, such as supporting restrictions on the , new taxes, and limits on freedom of association. Moreover, Johnson suffered a series of gaffes in September, failing to recognize the name of the Syrian city of Aleppo, sticking his tongue out at a reporter, and not being able to remember the name of a foreign leader he admired. Nevertheless, in the polls he has fared well for a Libertarian candidate, consistently polling higher than the one percent he received as the party's nominee in 2012.\nIn his write-in campaign, Perry plans to be certified as a write-in candidate in nine states plus the District of Columbia. In an additional eight states, all write-in votes are considered valid. According to Perry's calculations, this potentially provides him access to 114 electoral votes. \nWith \"Wikinews\", Perry discusses his reasons for running, his impact on the election, and how he plans to spread his message.\nWhat convinced you to begin a write-in campaign for president?\nWhat impact do you hope to have on the election?\nWhat is the primary focus of your campaign and what are you doing to get the message out?"}

Port was convicted of the murders on Wednesday.\nChef Port, 41, was first charged on October 18 last year and made his first court appearance the following day. He initially faced four counts of murder and four of \"administering a poison with intent to endanger life or inflict grievous bodily harm\". Two days later a provisional trial date was set in April but Port did not end up entering his pleas of not guilty until July 25. \nDelays were caused by post-charge investigations. By then Port was also facing the remaining charges; six more of administering a poison, seven of rape, and four of . These charges involved eight additional [alleged] victims. The poisoning charges were changed to \"administering a substance with intent to stupefy / overpower to allow sexual activity\" by the time of the trial.\nThe case revolved around allegations Port drugged, raped, and murdered men at his London flat. The prosecution told jurors Port's \"modus operandi\" was to arrange to meet gay men via and other gay dating sites, then administer sometimes-lethal overdoses of recreational drug .\nThree of the deaths occurred in 2014. Anthony Patrick Walgate, 23, was found dead on June 19, 2014 in Cooke Street. Port lived in Cooke Street. The other three victims were found in the vicinity of St. Margaret's Church on North Street. Gabriel Kovari, 22, was discovered dead on August 28, 2014. Daniel Whitworth, 21, was found dead the following month on September 20, 2014. Fourth victim Jack Taylor, 25, was found a year later on September 14, 2015.\nThe Metropolitan Police has referred itself to the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) concerning what police called \"potential vulnerabilities in [our response] to the four deaths.\" Police only linked the deaths less than a week before Port's arrest.\nDetectives released security footage of Taylor's movements, with an officer telling the press \"the man captured on may well be the last person to talk to Jack.\" Shortly after Port was charged police again appealed for anybody with knowledge of him \"no matter how insignificant\" to come forward in what local press called a \"highly unusual\" move.\nThe ten male jurors and two women were warned at the opening of the trial to face potentially graphic evidence in \"a cool, dispassionate and analytical manner\" by Jonathan Rees QC, prosecuting. He told the court Port satisfied his \"appetite for penetrating drugged young men\". The case was tried before Mr Justice Openshaw, who sentenced Port on Friday, at the Old Bailey, a famous London courthouse. Port was represented by David Etherington QC.\nCCTV of Port and Taylor at Barking Train Station featured in the trial. After exchanging Grindr messages the duo agreed a meet for September 13, 2014; the day prior to Taylor's body being found. The meeting was set for 3:00 at the station; Port is seen walking to the scene while Taylor arrives in a taxi. By 7:20 Port had blocked Taylor's Grindr account and later that day deleted his own account.\nA rubbish collector found Taylor's body, propped up and with his clothing ridden up as if he had been dragged. A bottle and bag of drugs were on his body, as was a syringe.\nPort contacted Walgate on website Sleepyboys. Walgate worked as a prostitute and had notified a friend of the planned night \"in case I get killed\". Port left the corpse outside his flat before phoning . Initially he denied knowing Walgate but later told police Walgate took drugs voluntarily while alone in the flat. Port, who said he \"panicked\" after returning from work to find Walgate dying, was imprisoned for eight months and released on licence after three in 2015 for lying in the investigation.\nThe prosecution told jurors Walgate was too cautious to consume drugs and it must have been Port who slipped him GHB, which led to death. Port's 999 call was played to jurors; he hangs up early after saying he has to go to his parked car and the operator calls back to ask further questions. In the call Port says the man has apparently collapsed, is possibly drunk, and is a stranger to him.\nPort was to tell police he slapped the man's face and heard a \"gurgling noise\" in response, but a statement from the first paramedic on-scene stated the body was already cold when help arrived. After being alerted to the death by the ambulance service police tracked down Port. Pathologist Olaf Biedrzycki testified at the trial that Walgate's death was due to GHB overdose, his underwear was both inside out and back to front, his fly was down, and there were fourteen injuries to the body.\nPort's police statement was that he had also propped the man into a sitting position, which was how paramedics found him. He said after ending the call he went to sleep rather than waiting for the ambulance. Walgate's top was raised suggesting dragging of the body, and there were drugs in a holdall beside the body. After the trial the reported a nearby CCTV camera was not working.\nThe bodies of both Kovari and Whitworth were found in the same spot as each other in St Margaret's churchyard, about 500 (1600 ) from Port's home, within a month of each other. Both were found by Barbara Denham who testified she walked her dog at least once a day through the area. Like Walgate, both men were found sitting. Like Walgate, a bottle of GHB was with Whitworth's body. Both of their clothing had again ridden up suggesting dragging. Whitworth was on a blue sheet; Port's semen was on the sheet, which had come from his flat.\nWhitworth's body bore an apparent suicide note in which he seemed to blame himself for Kovari's death, saying he had injected Kovari with GHB. The note said he could not confess to police for fear of his family seeing him going to prison. The note said \"please do not blame the guy I was with last night, we only had sex and then I left, he knows nothing of what I have done.\" \nRees told jurors an expert in handwriting analysis had ruled out Whitworth as the author and found it to be written by Port in what Rees called a \"wicked\" bid to frame Whitworth. Rees also said Port's DNA was on the bottle of drugs on Whitworth's corpse. Police initially accepted the note as genuine and did not investigate further; no effort was made to find who \"the guy I was with last night\" might be. The note was written on paper traced to Port's flat, and in a plastic sleeve also traced to the flat.\nRees said the man was Port, the two having met via Fitlads, and that \"cruel and manipulative\" Port deleted his Fitlads account shortly after the meet. Rees also said Kovari told friends he had found a flat in the Barking area of London five days before he was found dead, alleging this was Port's flat. Port's defence was Whitworth had dictated the note to him.\nWhitworth's boyfriend, Ricky Waumsley, told the court Whitworth's behaviour was inconsistent with guilty or suicidal thoughts. Waumsley also testified Port had never to his knowledge taken recreational drugs aside from experimenting with cannabis during a holiday in Amsterdam. \nKatie Impey, a friend of Whitworth, said the deceased's mother committed suicide and thereafter Whitworth viewed taking one's own life as \"the most selfish thing anyone could ever do, and you should never do it, so I know he didn't kill himself.\" Impey also spoke of the final conversation she had with her friend in which he spoke of a new romantic interest called Gab. \"He was really excited. He said 'I've met someone, he's really artsy, he's really cute, I don't know how I'm going to tell Ricky'.\"\nThe trial featured five months of content from a Facebook account named Jon Luck. Port's computer was used to access the account, and Port admitted he was the user. The account was used to exchange messages with Kovari's boyfriend Thierry Amodio, with Port pretending to be a Californian student who knew Kovari.\nPort, via the Jon Luck account, told Amodio he spent two days with Kovari and that Kovari attended a drugs-fueled orgy with a man named Dan. Amodio was seeking information on his partner's death; Port wrote \"I hope he wasn't murdered or anything like that as that would be awful.\" After Amodio assured him this was unlikely Port replied \"Thanks god for that I would hate anyone who could hurt him\".\nAround the time of Whitworth's death Port informed Amodio he had discovered Dan and Kovari had attended a party where young men were raped whilst drugged. Posing as Luck he said he had \"been expecting [police] to come to my door any second cuss of my DNA and my messages on [Kovari's] phone.\" When Amodio told Port he'd been visited by police probing Whitworth's death Port replied \"OMG your joking[...] please don't let them arrest me.\"\nPort would also press Amodio for information on police investigations and suggested Dan had accidentally killed Kovari with an overdose and then \"did same to himself\" because he \"could not live with the guilt\", an apparent reference to Daniel Whitworth's death. Amodio tried to get \"Jon Luck\" to contact police but this was never successful. Port told a neighbour Kovari died of infection in Spain after travelling to join somebody Kovari had met online.\nKovari had in fact moved from Spain to London, having been living with his Spanish boyfriend Thierry Amodio. After initially failing to find a place to live Kovari met John Pape. Pape allowed Kovari to stay with him, which he did for several weeks before securing a rented room with Port in the Barking area of London. Turning down an offer to stay longer, Kovari moved in with Port on August 23, 2014.\nThe same day Kovari sent another friend a map showing Port's Cooke St home as his new abode. The next day Port invited friend and neighbour Ryan Edwards to meet Kovari. On August 25 Kovari texted Edwards \"Stephen is not a nice person\". The same day Kovari messaged the friend he sent the map to, saying \"I'm fine.\"\nPape texted Kovari on August 26, asking \"Hey, hows it going in Barking?\" There was no reply. A text from Edwards to Port the same day asked \"How is Gabriel?\" Port responded Kovari had already moved out to live with \"some soldier guy he had been chatting to online\" in the area. The body was found two days later. The corpse was clad in sunglasses and Kovari's possessions were in two bags beside him.\nThe first alleged victim to give evidence, a nineteen-year-old student when he encountered Port, told jurors he met Port via Grindr and accepted a glass of wine at Port's flat. After noticing a bitter taste and sludge at the bottom of the glass, the complainant said he felt ill and upon sipping a second drink containing vodka he \"felt so dizzy. I was ricocheting off the walls. The room was tilting.\"\nThe man told the court he fell asleep and awoke naked on his front with Port raping him, describing himself as \"half asleep, half aware of what was happening\" before passing out again. He said he left the flat after coming round in the morning, still feeling the effects. The witness claimed that while he was considering having sex with Port when he arrived he did not at any stage consent.\nThe next alleged victim to give evidence, also a student, told the court he met Port via Fitlads. The witness said they met at Port's flat on several occasions. He said he declined alcohol because he was Muslim but on his fourth visit he accepted a glass of coke. He said swallowing it caused an instant burning sensation like acid, but Port pled ignorance and they met a fifth time. On that occasion Port gave the man what he said was \", and a massage, according to the witness.\nThe witness said he fell asleep and on waking was given a glass of what Port claimed was water, which instantly knocked him out. \"The next thing I remember I was on the floor screaming and shouting. It was like I was going mad.\" The witness claimed he was naked and confused, not even recalling his own name. \nPort drove the man to nearby Barking Rail Station. The victim was \"screaming and shouting\" and described Port \"kind of dragging me along and holding me up.\" Police and ambulance attended, with Constable Alesha Owers testifying Port seemed \"worried and jittery\" and accepted he had taken . Port claimed the man had turned up at his door and Port was helping him get home.\nThe witness did not give a statement to police, telling the trial he did not want his family to discover the encounters and simply wished to be home. He says on arriving he telephoned Port. \"I was shouting at him: 'What did you give me? What the hell did you give me, because it certainly wasn't poppers?'[...] I got the impression it was a normal thing what happened to me.\"\nThe witness added he had one final meeting with Port at the accused's flat. Port, he claimed, apologised to him but still did not say what substance was involved.\nA transgender man in his early twenties told the court he met Port via Facebook and they met for sex because the witness was angry his boyfriend had cheated on him. The man said after consensual sex and drinking he passed out and Port filmed himself raping the complainant. \nThe witness claimed Port showed off the video the following morning: \"I just thought he was disgusting and vile. He thought it was fine. He thought it was funny.\" The witness told the court he \"felt angry because you don\u2019t carry on having sex with someone when they pass out. I said, 'you\u2019re disgusting.'\"\nAnother man, now 24, told the court he met Port via Gaydar when he was 16 and grew close to Port as the man had few friends. He said Port pressured him into taking and he passed out, wakening to find himself on his back with his legs over Port's shoulders and Port raping him. He said he returned a week later, at which time Port again gave him mephedrone and raped him, as well as non-consensually injecting drugs into him. He told the court Port was \"god in his flat\", someone \"you did not argue with\". He told the Old Bailey \"I didn't feel like I was being treated like a person.\"\nThe court was played six homemade sex tapes from Port's phone, with police and prosecutors alleging they showed Port raping an unconscious 24-year-old man. The six were amongst over 80 sex tapes in total Port had made involving himself. The alleged victim testified that while he and Port had consensual sex and sniffed poppers after meeting via Manhunt he did not consent to any activity in the videos.\nAt least three other men can be seen or heard in the videos. Port sniffs a bottle in one video and tells an unidentified man \"you fuck him\". In another an unidentified voice says \"I\u2019ll leave you guys to carry on, I have got work in the morning.\" Port then says to a second man \"Shall we do more stuff?\" \"Yeah babe\" comes the reply. \nTwo of the rape charges are sample counts relating to the videos. Sample counts are a method by which prosecutors can try multiple similar crimes based on a single count. Port routinely browsed the Internet for rape-themed pornography.\nStephen Port's own sister, Sharon Port, was a prosecution witness. She spoke of a conversation with her brother \u2014 who smiled when she entered court to testify against him \u2014 the day before Slovakian national Kovari's body was found. Speaking quietly, she said she had rung him and found him \"very distressed\"; he said there was a corpse in his flat.\nSharon Port testified that the conversation left her with the understanding the pair had been doing drugs together and Kovari expired. She said she urged Stephen Port to alert the police; the following day, she drove from her home to visit him after he became unresponsive to messages. She described her brother as quiet, and saying he had been released on police bail to return in a month or two. \nKovari's body was found that day. Sharon Port said Stephen didn't mention the incident again at the time.\nAfter Rees finished, defence lawyer Etherington questioned her further. During this she added that in March 2015, when he was imprisoned for lies to police after the first death, Stephen told her that the conversation had not referred to a body at all. Instead, he was talking about another man altogether. \nTwo former partners of Port testified early in the trial. Both said the accused wore a wig to help him feel confident about his appearance, and one further said both would watch 'twink' porn together. In the gay community, slender young men are sometimes referred to as twinks. The man also testified Port \"never tried any sexual acts I wasn\u2019t happy with.\" The court also heard Port was a prostitute and sometimes wore the wig to meet men. Port was said to have called Kovari his \"new Slovakian twink flatmate\" who was \"quite cute, tall and skinny\" to friends.\nPort's sister, during her evidence, spoke of a bullied, quiet schoolboy who revealed his sexuality at 26. She said their mother did not approve. She also testified she was wholly unaware of Port's drug use until the August 2014 phone call and even after did not know which substances were involved.\nPort gave evidence in his own defence. Starting on October 27 he spoke of his version of the deaths. He started with the death of Walgate, confirming he offered the student 800 to spend the night with him. Port claimed Walgate visited the bathroom during sex, returning \"high and very rampant.\" Port testified he was unaware what Walgate had taken but spoke of his own experiences with GHB, which he said \"could knock you out\" before reawakening aroused. Port said he used it to have \"hyper high\" sex and in one relationship it was normal for him to have sex with his partner while the latter was unconscious through GHB use.\nPort claimed Walgate became unwell and slept at the flat; Port went to work that morning and returned to find the deceased still there and woke that night to discover the \"very rigid\" body. Port said he \"just panicked\" when he carried Walgate's corpse outside to call an ambulance, lying about the circumstances because he was \"in shock\".\nThe next day Port confirmed Kovari shared his flat and said the pair went to a party to take drugs and have sex. He said his \"friend\" Kovari left early with 'Dan'. \nPort testified he realised weeks later Dan was Daniel Whitworth, whom he had met online. He spoke of Kovari and Whitworth having sex at the party with several onlookers but said he would not be able to find where the party was held and did not know who lived there. He said Kovari and Whitworth went to his flat \"to get a bit more privacy\".\nRees asserted Port was \"caught out\" in a lie. The prosecution claimed Whitworth could be placed in a pub elsewhere when the alleged party happened and Rees said Port's account amounted to the pair getting \"coy and bashful\" after public sex. Rees asked Port to explain Whitworth's presence \"in two places at once\". \"I've no idea. I just know it was as I remember it,\" said Port.\nPort said Whitworth later recounted to him a story in which Whitworth and Kovari had sex at St Margaret's. After both passed out, Whitworth claimed he was unable to rouse Kovari and could not revive him.\n\"He said he panicked. He was going to call an ambulance but did not know what to do, so he left him.\" Port said he reassured a worried and guilt-ridden Whitworth and urged him to go to police. Port and Whitworth had sex with drugs at Whitworth's suggestion, Port said, before Whitworth dictated the suicide note.\n\"I thought it was just the [drugs] talking and he was just getting his emotions out of his system,\" Port told jurors. \"I didn't believe he was actually going to do it. I would have stopped him. I would have done anything to prevent him doing it.\" Port said he added the line reading \"please do not blame the guy I was with last night.\"\nRees accused Port of manipulating evidence, saying he left a hoodie belonging to Kovari on Whitworth's body alongside a bottle of GHB. Port countered he only agreed to write the suicide note because Whitworth promised sex in exchange for it. Port testified they did not in fact have sex because Whitworth gave him a drink laced with GHB, causing Port to fall unconscious. \n\"You are not suggesting he may have drugged you Mr Port?\" asked Rees. \"You are not suggesting he may have taken advantage of you whilst you were drugged?\" Port confirmed this was possible, leading to Rees asking \"Why did you raise the suggestion this young man may have raped or sexually assaulted you? Against this dead boy?\" Port answered \"I wouldn't have minded if he did.\"\n\"Come on, Mr Port!\" Rees retaliated. \"That's not true, is it? You \" other people, they don't top you. So you would have minded if he raped you whilst you were unconscious.\" Port's response was \"It's just a shame we didn't get to do more together.\" Rees later said \"You just cannot bring yourself to accept the truth of what is going here. To the families. Lie after lie, that's what's being played out here in this court.\"\nHe also recounted his time with Taylor. The pair met on Grindr and Port testified Taylor accepted a suggestion to get \"mega high\", before the two left for \"fresh air\" and had \"rampant\" sex at St Margaret's. Port described this in detail: \"I realised our height difference was quite significant[...] It was a bit of a struggle at first, I had to hold him around the chest. Then we just had sex like that for two hours.\"\nPort testified he suggested going back to the flat; \"He said, 'I'm going to sit down here for a bit, I\u2019m feeling tired.'\" Port said he left around 2:30 in the morning and never saw Taylor again but he was \"very much alive\" at this point. He testified he left as he had a new job to go to the next day and did not expect anything further as Taylor \"was not happy being gay.\"\nPort spoke of his previous accounts to police, especially his denials of knowing Taylor and Kovari while being uncertain if he knew Whitworth. He said \"The truth sounded like a lie, so I lied to make it sound like the truth.\" Under cross-examination from Rees, he also admitted his version was hard to accept and appeared as if he was a \"determined liar to save your own skin\".\n\"The essence of it is, you like playing God and manipulating and controlling young men\", Rees told him in front of jurors. \"The key to this case is you like penetrating young men who are unconscious. That is at the heart of this case, isn't it? You try to manipulate the evidence to fit the facts as you know them to be and you have done this throughout this case.\"\nRees asked \"Do you agree it is never too late to tell the truth? Do you agree it would be a good thing for the families of the four dead men to learn the truth about what happened to them?\" Port responded \"of course.\" After agreeing all four deceased met similar deaths shortly after being in his company, Port was asked \"I know it\u2019s very late in the day, Mr Port, would you care to change any part of your account you have given to the jury?\" \"No,\" he replied.\nThe jury began deliberations on Monday last week, deliberating for over 28 hours. They faced a question of intent. The prosecution had to prove intent to cause very serious harm for a murder conviction. The prosecution case was Port administered GHB in a bid to cause comas, and Walgate's death at least was likely unexpected. The jury had to decide if a coma met the test; if not, they could convict on alternative charges of manslaughter. The jury unanimously convicted Port of three murders, and by an 11\u20131 majority of Walgate's murder. \nPort was simultaneously convicted of most other charges and on Wednesday Mr Justice Openshaw informed jurors a 10\u20132 verdict would be acceptable for the remaining counts. Port was ultimately convicted of all charges against six surviving victims. He was also convicted of offences against a seventh but acquitted of raping him. The jury acquitted him of two rapes relating to an eighth man.\nDuring Port's trial one of his drug dealers, Peter Hirons, 48, separately pleaded guilty at Snaresbrook Crown Court to supplying \u033a, crystal meth, mephedrone, , , and GBL, the last being metabolised into GHB when ingested. He also admitted possessing \u00a36,060 of drug-dealing proceeds. He was jailed for two and a half years. Gerald Matovu appeared before Westminster Magistrates' Court on Thursday, charged with supplying Port with mephedrone and GHB.\nLead investigator DCI Tim Duffield called Port \"one of the most dangerous individuals I've encountered\". Victims' relatives clapped, cheered, and yelled as Port was sentenced.\nPolice were criticised early in the case after the LGBT website \"Pink News\" revealed a friend of Kovari had contacted them after the death. \"Pink News\" in turn contacted the Metropolitan Police but received assurances police did not view the death as suspicious. The revelations coincided with the police appeal following Port's initial charges. \"This appeal should have been made in June and August last year after the first two killings\", said human rights activist Peter Tatchell at the time. \"If the police had done that, the killer may have been caught and some of these men might still be alive.\"\nFollowing murder convictions it was revealed Taylor's family triggered the homicide investigation themselves after pressuring police. Taylor's relatives have indicated they intend to sue the police. The IPCC probe is examining possible failings by seventeen officers. In July the IPCC appealed for anybody who raised concerns with police prior to the launch of the murder investigation to contact them, and revealed they had met with London's LGBT community.\nOn Wednesday the IPCC reiterated its call for witnesses, revealing seven Metropolitan Police officers had been informed they faced gross misconduct probes and ten more faced less-serious misconduct probes. Officers under investigation rank from constable to inspector. British Transport Police are not under investigation.\nIPCC Commissioner Cindy Butts said \"It is important we establish whether the police response to the deaths of all four men was thorough and appropriate in the circumstances, including whether discrimination played any part in actions and decisions[...] our investigators are continuing to work hard to scrutinise the police response to the tragic deaths of these four young men.\"\nTatchell accused police of \"class, gender and sexuality bias\" and called the verdict \"no compensation for the loss of four young gay men who had their lives, hopes and dreams cut short.\" \"If four young well-off women had been murdered in Mayfair, I believe the police would have made a public appeal much sooner and mounted a far more comprehensive investigation\", he said on Wednesday. Tatchell said police could have prevented some murders; Taylor's family agreed. \"We do believe Jack would still be here if they had done their job\" they said. \"The police should be held accountable for Jack's death. We do understand it's not them who took Jack's life, but Stephen Port would have been stopped.\"\n\"This has been an incredibly detailed and wide-ranging inquiry with detectives not only investigating these crimes but providing full support to all the families and victims\" said Stuart Cundy, a Metropolitan Police Commander. \"Throughout this case we have worked very closely with the LGBT community\" he added. Cundy claimed none of the surviving victims had been in touch with police prior to Port facing murder charges.\nA Metropolitan Police statement said the force takes \"Offences against members of the LGBT community[...] extremely seriously.\" The force said it had 900 hate crimes investigators in addition to 150 specialist LGBT officers.\nCundy however acknowledged \"potential missed opportunities\" to catch Port. He said he has written to the deceaseds' families, apologising. \"I have offered to meet them if they would like to do so, both now and at the conclusion of the IPCC investigation.\" He said police were co-operating with the IPCC probe.\nWhen Port was arrested for perverting the course of justice police seized his laptop, but did not examine it. Detectives took advice from homicide specialists but a murder investigation was not launched and Port was released on bail while the Crown Prosecution Service considered charging him. Port murdered Kovari and Whitworth while on bail.\nPort's laptop, when eventually examined, showed Port first looked at Walgate's escorting ad on June 13, 2014. On the same day he also sought out gay rape pornography. Searches included \"sleeping boy\", \"unconscious boys\", \"drugged and raped\", \"taking date rape drug\", \"gay teen knocked out raped\" and \"guy raped and tortured young nude boy\". Friends of Walgate pressed police to examine the laptop, with one alleging police told her it was too expensive.\nAmodio emailed a detective about the Jon Luck communications. Over several exchanges the detective asked Amodio to get Luck to contact him, but police did not take it upon themselves to trace Luck. Had they done so they would have found Port. Amodio also linked the deaths of Kovari and Whitworth to the earlier death of Walgate, but the detective told him the first death was \"nothing about Gabriel or Daniel.\"\nWhitworth's death also caused his friends to press police for further action, but police again did not treat the death as suspicious despite seeking advice from homicide specialists. Port's DNA was on the blanket with Whitworth's body; police already had his DNA from arresting Port during the Walgate investigation. Police did not trace his movements or investigate the man referred to in the apparent suicide note.\nDCI Tony Kirk said to press the two deaths were \"unusual and slightly confusing\" but not murders. A pathologist found Whitworth had \"bruising below both arms in the armpit regions which is unlikely to have been caused accidentally and may have resulted from manual handling of the deceased, most likely prior to death.\" At inquest coroner Nadia Persaud recorded open verdicts and advised police to perform additional forensic tests, but this was not done.\nPort was finally caught after Taylor's murder when the victim's older sisters linked his death to the other three. While pressing police to take action, they learned of CCTV showing Taylor and an unidentified person. Taylor's sisters convinced police to release the footage in a bid to trace the man; when this was done, another officer recognised Port from the footage. He was arrested and the case became a murder probe.\nPolice are re-examining a further 58 fatal GHB overdoses from June 2011 to October 2015. \"We can't rule out the fact there may be other victims out there who suffered at Port's hands and have yet to come forward,\" Cundy said. \"We would appeal for them to contact us as soon as possible.\""}

The fault was announced rectified two minutes later by another tweet from SMRT, though delays were still expected in the direction of station due to congestion at stations and on trains.\nSMRT issued another tweet at 8:09 am, alerting commuters to another signalling fault affecting the CCL, on the stretch between and stations.\nInitially informing commuters that the issue would add 10 minutes of travel time along the affected stretch, the company later revised this to 20, and finally, 30 minutes in subsequent tweets, attributing the delays to \"intermittent signalling faults\".\nThe company later announced via Twitter service unavailable between Botanic Gardens and stations at 9:06 am, whilst offering free bus services along the length of the CCL. SMRT later amended the announcement in another tweet to encompass the stretch between Botanic Gardens and stations. Train service was restored along the affected stretch by about 10:27 am.\nSMRT had previously experienced disruptions in service on the CCL for five consecutive days in September, also attributable to signalling issues, leading to authorities briefly switching off mobile signals at four CCL stations for two hours on September 2 during investigations.

The company continued to offer free bus services until 7 pm, when it announced the termination of the service on Twitter. \nIn the wake of yesterday's incidents, commuters criticized SMRT's handling of the matter on social media, citing SMRT's failure to provide sufficient information or sufficient buses for commuters, and uploading photos of the congestion."}

In the four way race, Clinton led Trump 43.7% to 41.1% with Libertarian Party presidential nominee Gary Johnson at 7.0% and Green Party presidential nominee Jill Stein at 2.3%. The politics of polling became a campaign issue as national polls fluctuated throughout the month with some showing as high as a 12 point lead for Clinton and others with Trump in the lead. In statewide polling, in a rarity for independent presidential candidates, , who named political consultant of Texas as his running mate in October, took the lead in his home-state of Utah in an Emerson poll. As Election Day, November 8, drew near, began in multiple states in October. RealClearPolitics declared Florida, Ohio, Michigan, Pennsylvania, New Hampshire, Maine, North Carolina, Georgia, Colorado, Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico, and Iowa as toss-up states.\nOctober was a month of . As Trump continued to refuse to release his tax returns, on the first of the month, \"The New York Times\" published Trump's 1995 returns sent to them from an anonymous source. The returns showed Trump had declared a US$916 million loss in 1995, allowing him to shield $50 million in taxable income per year for the next 18 years for the purposes of federal income tax. Clinton speculated Trump did not paid any federal income taxes during the period. She asked, \"What kind of genius loses $1 billion in a single year?\" In a statement, the Trump campaign claimed \"The Times\" illegally obtained the record and accused it of being \"an extension of the Clinton Campaign.\" Going further, the statement said Trump had a \"fiduciary responsibility [...] to pay no more tax than legally required.\" Trump later argued he had \"brilliantly\" taken advantage of tax laws. A day after the publication, political operative Roger Stone warned of another \"WikiLeaks\" release of documents related to Clinton. As observers awaited the release, Trump running mate Mike Pence and Clinton running mate participated in the vice presidential debate. According to AP analysis, Kaine spoke in an aggressive manner and often interrupted Pence, who remained relatively calm throughout. A CNN poll of debate watchers declared Pence the winner, 48% to 42%. Days later, still without any \"WikiLeaks\" release, Trump supporters began to wonder if any release was pending or whether an outside entity influenced \"WikiLeaks\" director Julian Assange not to release the documents. A statement from the claimed, with confidence, that documents released on \"WikiLeaks\" were the result of hacks by the Russian government. On October 7, as Trump took some time off from campaigning to prepare for the October 9 debate, the \"WikiLeaks\" release did occur, but a different leak had a greater impact. \"The Washington Post\" set off a political firestorm as it released leaked video of Trump from 2005 speaking with , then a presenter for ', about how Trump kisses women without waiting and \"grab[s] them by the pussy,\" explaining he can get away with it because he is famous. In response, the Trump campaign immediately put out a release calling the comments \"locker room banter,\" claiming former President Bill Clinton said \"far worse\" while playing golf with Trump, and apologizing \"if anyone was offended.\" Hillary Clinton sent out a tweet calling the comments \"horrific\" and argued the American people \"cannot allow his man to be president.\" Many Republicans, including some supporters, denounced Trump. Pence was \"beside himself\" according to the Associated Press. House Speaker Paul Ryan disinvited Trump from a joint campaign appearance. Two dozen Republican officeholders including Senators of New Hampshire, John McCain of Arizona, and of Ohio, unendorsed Trump. Some prominent Republicans called on Trump to withdraw from the race. At the end of the tumultuous day, Trump released a taped message, again apologizing for his \"foolish\" 2005 comments while arguing \"there's a big difference between the words and actions of other people.\" He accused Bill Clinton of having \"actually abused women\" and Hillary Clinton of \"bull[ying], attack[ing], sham[ing], and intimidat[ing]\" these same women. Trump promised further discussion on the topic and affirmed his participation in the upcoming debate. The next day, he told ' he would never quit the race. Pence told donors he would remain on the ticket as well. According to a poll, only 12% of Republicans felt Trump should withdraw. Media coverage of the tape overshadowed the \"WikiLeaks\" release of hacked e-mails from Clinton campaign chairman , which included transcripts of paid speeches Clinton gave. Controversial parts included Clinton admitting to having both a private and public position on issues and describing her \"dream\" of a \"hemispheric common market [in North America], with open trade and open borders.\"\nJust prior to the October 9 debate, Trump held a press conference with , a rape victim whose alleged rapist was defended by Hillary Clinton, as well as , , and , who have each accused Bill Clinton of sexual impropriety. At the event, alluding to the 2005 tape, Broaddrick commented, \"Mr. Trump may have said some bad words, but Bill Clinton raped me.\" The Clinton campaign referred to the press conference as a \"stunt.\" As the candidates took the stage for the debate, they forewent the customary handshake. During the debate, organized as a town hall moderated by and , Trump proclaimed he had not done any of the things he mentioned in the leaked tape. Clinton attempted to connect Trump to Russia and claimed Trump lived in an \"alternative reality.\" Trump referred to Clinton as \"the devil\" and said she has \"tremendous hate in her heart.\" He called for a renewed criminal investigation into her handling of classified information. After Clinton remarked, \"it's just awfully good that someone with the temperament of Donald Trump is not in charge of the law in our country\", Trump quipped, \"Because you'd be in jail.\" Clinton addressed the content of her paid speeches, arguing her statement about having both private and public positions referred to . Trump responded, \"she\u2019s blaming the lie on the late great Abraham Lincoln [...] Honest Abe never lied [...] That's the big difference between Abraham Lincoln and you.\" Trump openly disagreed with his running mate Pence, arguing the US military should not target the Bashar al-Assad regime in Syria. Near the end of the debate, audience member Ken Bone asked a question about energy policy. Bone's attire and demeanor turned him into an instant online viral sensation. For the final question, an audience member asked each candidate to say something nice about the other. Clinton praised Trump for his family, while Trump praised Clinton as a \"fighter.\" The two shook hands at the conclusion. Although opinion polls scored the debate as a victory for Clinton, according to Politics1.com, Clinton was \"not as sharp\" and Trump had a \"much better night\" likely enough to end the repeated calls from GOP officials for him to leave the race. A 22-member focus group hosted by Fox News pollster scored the debate for Trump, 16 to 6, leading Luntz to conclude, \"Tonight was so significant that [Trump] is back in the race.\" Pence also declared Trump the winner and tweeted congratulations. The tweet served as an affirmation Pence would remain on the ticket. As Trump returned to the campaign trail, he renewed attacks against the GOP establishment, including Speaker Ryan, for its tepid support. He accused the establishment of involvement in a \"sinister deal\" to hurt his campaign. \"Politico\" reported the RNC had spent no money on TV advertisements for Trump. Nevertheless, as the media focus shifted away from the leaked 2005 tape, several officeholders who had just un-endorsed Trump, re-endorsed his candidacy. Moreover, his support among GOP members increased from 74% before the debate to 89% afterwards. \"WikiLeaks\" continued an incremental release of Podesta e-mails while simultaneously, women came forward accusing Trump of sexual misconduct. \"The New York Times\" published a story in which two women accused Trump of inappropriate touching. Trump threatened to sue the paper. He accused Mexican billionaire , a \"Times\" shareholder, of being behind the story to hurt his campaign due to Trump's proposals related to Mexico. Additional women came forward accusing Trump of unwelcome kissing, groping, and sexual advances. Trump denied all the claims, at times insinuated his accusers were too unattractive for him to assault, and vowed to sue each accuser after the election. He referred to his accusers as pawns of globalist special interests and political elites, and claimed \"This election is being rigged by the media pushing false and unsubstantiated charges, and outright lies, in order to elect Crooked Hillary!\" As Trump and his supporters continued to describe the election as rigged, President Barack Obama chimed in, saying Trump \"seems to be in middle of the game making excuses for why he might be losing\". On October 16, the campaign took a violent turn as a GOP office in North Carolina was firebombed. Trump claimed the story would have received more attention if it was a Democratic Party office. As \"WikiLeaks\" continued to release Podesta e-mails, the nation of Ecuador shut off Julian Assange's internet access at his residence in the Ecuadorian embassy in London. The nation claimed it did this to avoid interference with the US presidential election. \"WikiLeaks\" vowed to continue releasing documents. According to a new WikiLeaks e-mail dump, DNC interim chair forwarded at least one question for a CNN town hall to the Clinton campaign ahead of the event during the primary campaign. Brazile denied sending the message. Conservative group joined in surprise releases, publishing undercover video allegedly of a Democratic Party operative discussing the use of individuals to disrupt Trump rallies and claiming the Clinton campaign was aware of the efforts.\nAs the October 19 debate approached, Trump questioned the fairness of the election process, the legitimacy of opinion polls, and asked supporters to \"forget the press, read the internet.\" To the final debate, he invited President Obama's half-brother , who had endorsed Trump, as well as Patricia Smith, mother of diplomat who died in the . She had previously spoken at the Republican National Convention. Clinton invited businesswoman , billionaire , and former basketball player , all of whom had endorsed Clinton. The third and final debate took place in Las Vegas and was moderated by Fox News host . As in the second debate, there was no handshake between the candidates before. Unlike the second, there was no handshake afterward. During the debate, Trump stated he would appoint pro-life justices to the Supreme Court and that the likely result would be the overturning of '. Clinton countered she would nominate justices to uphold \"Roe\". Trump received criticism for referring to illegal immigrants as \"bad \"hombres\".\" After Trump spoke about having a closer relationship with Russia, Clinton implied Trump was a \"puppet\" of Russian President Vladimir Putin to which Trump repeatedly interrupted, \"No. You're the puppet!\" Trump referred to the as a \"criminal enterprise\" and accused Clinton of encouraging violence at his rallies based on the Project Veritas video. His most controversial comments came when he refused to say whether he would accept the results of the election and near the close of the debate when he interrupted Clinton to refer to her as \"such a nasty woman.\" The \"nasty woman\" comment became a rallying call for Clinton supporters with Senator Elizabeth Warren later commenting, \"We nasty women are going to march our nasty feet to cast our nasty votes to get [Trump] out of our lives forever\". According to CNN's poll, Clinton won the debate 52% to 39%. However, according to CNN's 15 member focus group, Trump won 10 to 5. Frank Luntz's focus group likewise showed Trump winning, by a margin of 14 to 12. A day after the debate, Trump held a rally and announced \"I will totally accept the results of this great and historic presidential election \u2014 if I win.\" He and Clinton both attended the traditional with Cardinal seated between them. Although the event was meant to feature lighthearted and often self-deprecating statements from the candidates, Trump received boos when the crowd felt he was too harsh on Clinton. Nevertheless, Clinton and Trump shook hands at the conclusion. Back on the campaign trail, Trump began using the phrase \"Drain the Swamp\" to describe the defeat of the establishment in Washington, D.C. In an October 22 speech in , he laid out a plan for the first 100 days of his administration and unveiled a \"Contract for the American Voter,\" which included such policy proposals as a Constitutional amendment to impose term limits on Congress, a federal employee hiring freeze, and a ban on fundraising by foreign lobbyists in US elections. He received his first major newspaper endorsement from the ', owned by billionaire Trump supporter . For the Clinton campaign, surrogates such as First Lady Michelle Obama, President Obama, and Bernie Sanders traveled about to spread the campaign's message; entertainers such as , and also played a role. As most opinion polls continued to show Clinton ahead of Trump, Trump's campaign manager admitted the campaign was behind and that Clinton \"has tremendous advantages.\" Meanwhile, Trump began arguing Democrats were creating \"phony polls\" to suppress the turnout of his supporters. He also argued the media was ignoring polls such as those from and the \"Los Angeles Times\", which regularly showed him tied or slightly ahead of Clinton. Still, he acknowledged, \"I guess I\u2019m somewhat behind in the polls, but not by much.\" As October drew to a close, three additional surprises threatened to change the course of the election. First, Obamacare rates were announced to be rising significantly for 2017 throughout the nation; over 50% in some states and by an average of 25% nationally. One in five users would have only one plan from which to choose. Second, more revelations from \"WikiLeaks\" including a release showing how an adviser used President Bill Clinton's status, what he referred to as \"Bill Clinton, Inc.,\" to secure donations to the Clinton Foundation from certain corporations as well as speaking fees, traveling expenses, and vacations in exchange for access, leading to accusations of pay-to-play. Third, FBI director James Comey wrote a letter to certain Congressional committee chairs stating the FBI discovered new evidence and was re-opening the investigation into Hillary Clinton's e-mail server. According to reports, the relevant e-mails were discovered on a device of former Congressman Anthony Weiner, who was under investigation for sexting with an under-aged girl. Weiner allegedly shared the device with his wife , a top aide to Clinton. The Clinton campaign demanded to see the evidence. Senator Harry Reid argued Comey's letter may have violated the and accused the FBI of not releasing information about connections between the Trump campaign and the Russian government. Commenting on the matter, Trump said, \"Clinton\u2019s corruption on a scale we have never seen before. We must not let her take her criminal scheme into the Oval Office.\" Clinton said, \"No matter what they throw at us these last few days, we're not going to back down.\" In the RealClearPolitics average for October 31, Clinton led Trump 48.0% to 44.9% in the head-to-head matchup, but her lead dwindled in the four-way race, 45.6% to 42.7% with Johnson at 4.7% and Stein at 2.1%.\nFree &amp; Equal Debate.\nOn October 25, the held a debate on the campus of the in , moderated by actor and Free &amp; Equal founder . This was the organization's third election cycle hosting a presidential debate. Constitution Party presidential nominee , presidential nominee , and Reform Party presidential nominee all took part in the near two-hour event. Gary Johnson, Jill Stein, and Evan McMullin were each invited but did not attend.\n\"Shame on Jill Stein and Gary Johnson in particular for not coming\", said Castle, reflecting the overall feeling of the three debaters. La Riva described the absences as \"a lack of respect for those of us who have fought so hard in this electoral year to have a voice for the people.\"\nAlthough major party candidates have never participated in the event and are barred from doing so by the , the absence of Johnson was controversial. Reportedly, Stein and McMullin did not attend because of Johnson's absence. Johnson, who participated in the same debate in 2012 along with Stein, was said by Tobin to be concerned about appearing credible to the media.\n\"They are so high and mighty. They want to be Democrats and Republicans so badly,\" proclaimed Castle about Johnson and Stein, \"They are afraid to come out and get down on the same level with people like us.\"\nThe Libertarian and Green Party presidential nominees also skipped the first Free &amp; Equal Debate in 2008. Then-Libertarian Party presidential nominee Bob Barr missed the debate because of a previously scheduled event. Then-Green Party presidential nominee was absent because Free &amp; Equal did not consult with her before scheduling the event. That year, independent presidential candidate and Constitution Party presidential nominee were the only participants. \nCastle, who served as Baldwin's 2008 running mate, previously participated in a Free &amp; Equal vice presidential debate that year, a fact he brought up in his opening statement. Notably, throughout the debate, Castle repeatedly expressed astonishment when he agreed with his \"socialist friend\" La Riva. However, on the first topic, there was disagreement regarding the . While Castle, who said he would generally support such a pipeline, argued Dakota Access did not cross the , La Riva rebutted the proposed route crosses lands the US government took from the . Moreover, she said the proposed route crosses the and Rivers opening the possibility for contamination. Later in the debate, La Riva and Castle differed substantially on health care. While Castle called for a capitalistic solution, La Riva countered that capitalism was the reason for the health care crisis.\nLa Riva, who was her party's presidential nominee in 2008 and was a stand-in in some states in 2012 due to the constitutional ineligibility of the party's official nominee , did not previously qualify for the Free &amp; Equal debate. In 2012, Free &amp; Equal extended invitations only to those candidates who reached 1% in any \"neutral\" national poll. In addition to Johnson and Stein, this included then-Constitution Party presidential nominee Virgil Goode and then-Justice Party presidential nominee Rocky Anderson. This year, Free &amp; Equal lowered its inclusion standard to those with ballot access to at least 15% of the electorate. La Riva met this standard. In the debate, she passionately argued in favor of , endorsing an \"economic, social, and political revolution,\" which entails sharing \"all the wealth that the people create\" and \"changing the economic system of capitalism to a socialist one; to a people's democracy.\" De La Fuente said he agreed with La Riva in terms of health care, arguing for fixes to and ultimately the implementation of .\nDe La Fuente, whom \"Wikinews\" interviewed earlier this year, previously ran for the Democratic Party presidential nomination. During the debate, he touted himself as the \"first Hispanic-American to be on the ballot in 20 states.\" In focusing on minority issues, he discussed the disproportionate incarceration of minorities for offenses. Asner, who often commented during the course of the debate, wondered whether the discrepancy was the result of economic rather than racial factors. De La Fuente argued it might be contributed to by both.\nOn other issues, the candidates had spirited discussion. While addressing the treatment of such as Julian Assange, , and , Castle referred to each as a hero and said he would offer a pardon as president. La Riva called for the elimination of the , FBI, and , characterizing these organizations as enemies of the American people. On the issue of military adventurism, all candidates agreed the U.S. should remove its forces from the Middle East. After Asner brought up President 's , warning of the , Castle discussed how President heeded the warning and came up with policies of his own, which he felt ultimately led to Kennedy's . However, Castle was quick to say he does not subscribe to . Each candidate expressed opposition to the and , though De La Fuente and Castle each acknowledged the necessity of . On the issue of campaign finance reform, Castle proposed giving $50 million to each of the candidates on the basis of ballot access. De La Fuente said he had not considered Castle's proposal, but \"it makes a lot of sense.\" He mentioned his Democratic Party run and accused the party of \"building walls\" to prevent outsiders like himself from gaining traction. He also claimed the party cheated Senator Bernie Sanders out of the nomination. Near the end of the debate, a student from the University of Colorado asked a question about . La Riva called for free education and in absence of that, proposed a student strike to demand debt-free education. Castle said the debt crisis was the result of government interference into education, saying loans would not be made if government did not guaranty them. He proposed use of law to alleviate the debt. De La Fuente proposed a \"virtual reality university\" using experts from around the world to teach subjects online to Americans for free, arguing Americans, and particularly minorities, lack the time to attend a four-year university.\nUnlike Asner, Tobin did not comment much as moderator, but she chimed in on the issue of ballot access. Tobin explained how she received an inquiry regarding ballot access for former Senator , who ran as a Democrat and was considering an independent run for president in 2016. She discovered it would take 900,000 signatures to achieve full ballot access, requiring the collection of 1.6 million signatures with lower range costs of US$7 to US$10 million and high estimates of up to US$20 million. In response, each candidate discussed their experiences with ballot access restrictions. La Riva proposed parties be able to qualify for nationwide ballot access.\nSome lighthearted moments included Asner forgetting Castle's first name, De La Fuente questioning whether an interjection from Asner would count against his time, and Castle upon reaching the end of his time, commenting on the \"relentless pressure of this woman [presumably the timekeeper] on the front row [to] stop me.\"\nIn closing, De La Fuente called his two fellow debaters \"presidential\" and said he \"would be proud for them to be my president, and not those two, dumb and dumber, [the major party candidates] who are trying to go for the job.\" Asner expressed appreciation to each participant, and declared the candidates \"gave this election dignity.\" \nFinal pleas.\nWith Darrell Castle, Gloria La Riva, and Rocky De La Fuente making their case to voters at the Free &amp; Equal debate, \"Wikinews\" provided an opportunity to other presidential candidates who were not invited.\nThose making their final pleas include: nominee (who asked to use the same statement he made as a final plea as his party's nominee in 2012); and presidential nominee , and former Tax Assessor , nominee of the Prohibition Party.\nBallot access maps for each of the three candidates appear above their respective statements.\n\"Without faith there can be no justice. The two things are inextricably linked.\n\"What is justice? To put it most simply, it is right-doing. In terms of the law and self-government, it is doing right to all persons equally and equitably.\n\"But how can we possibly perfect justice in this country, as the framers of our Constitution purposed to do, if we pay no mind to the laws of nature and of nature's God? It is not possible.\n\"Is there a desire in your heart to help save this country and restore America's greatness? Then trust God, seek His will, and do right. Join together with your fellow citizens who are of the same mind and heart, and retake the reins of your own self-government. If enough Americans will do this, without compromise, and do it in time, there is hope for this country and for our posterity. We can, if we choose to follow God and do right, once again be a shining city on a hill.\n\"But if we refuse, and choose instead to be faithless and unjust by continuing to kill the babies and destroy God's institution of marriage and the natural family, our children and grandchildren, those who survive our brutal savagery, will curse us. They will rightfully convict us of squandering their precious heritage, one that was dearly bought with blood, sweat, and tears by our just and faithful forebears.\n\"Our generation is a link in the chain between the past and the future. Please, my fellow Americans, I beg you, don't let it be broken. Strengthen the things that remain, before it is too late.\"\n\"Let the election be a reminder that no candidate will be able to provide the solutions to problems that are systemic. The effort to see the public focus on individuals is a con, a diversion. Please \u2014 don't fall for it. We aren't saying don't vote. What we are saying is that, if we are to see substantive change \u2014 the kinds of changes that are going to deliver peace \u2014 the people are going to lead the way. We can't vote peace into office. The capitalist system is inherently racist, sexist, exploitative, and oppressive. An individual can't change that. However, candidates need you [to] buy into the diversion to make sure they either maintain power or that they are elected into a position of power. Once the public starts focusing on the system, it's essentially a game over scenario for those who profit off of exploitation and oppression.\"\n\"If these two sleaze-balls are the best America has to offer, Heaven help the USA! Please send the major parties that message by voting for third-party candidates. \n\"If you live in one of the three states where the Prohibition Party is on the ballot, we would appreciate your choosing us. The Prohibition Party, America's oldest minor party, is the only party basing its platform on what is best for families and local communities. Our candidates, Jim Hedges (president) and Bill Bayes (vice-president), both have military backgrounds. They both support public education. They both believe in small government and local control. They practice decency and humility in their daily walks; neither has financial or personal baggage such as calls into question the integrity of the major-party candidates.\n\"Yes, 'Make America Great Again' by repudiating Trump and Clinton\"\nPredictions.\nThis month, \"Wikinews\" asked recent interviewees to predict the results of the 2016 presidential election. Political consultant Dan Judy of North Star Opinion Research; author and blogger Darryl Perry, a write-in candidate for president; and author and historian Darcy Richardson, a former candidate for the Reform Party presidential nomination; all weighed in with their predictions. \n\"With the caveat that pollsters hate predicting the future (haha), right now I'd say that Clinton carries every state that Obama carried in 2012, plus North Carolina and Arizona. Trump will carry the rest, except Utah, which Evan McMullin will narrowly win.\"\n\"I think the map from FiveThirtyEight.com will be mostly accurate. . . I know they're almost always correct. There may be a state or two that go in a different direction, but I'm not confident enough to say what state(s) will go to whom.\"\n\"Coupled with the fact that a vast majority of the electorate believes the country is headed in the wrong direction, the 2016 presidential campaign will be a resounding reaction to America\u2019s tragic economic decline over the past three decades, if not longer. This long overdue reaction, borne of anger and frustration, will surprise only the pundits. To a certain extent, in fact, the results will be a sweeping repudiation of the mainstream media itself.\n\"Defying conventional wisdom and the preponderance of the national polls, I think Donald Trump will emerge victorious on Nov. 8th, amassing approximately 62.5 million votes to Hillary Clinton\u2019s 59 million. With the exception of North Carolina (where the Democrats arguably have their strongest GOTV [get out to vote] effort), I think Trump will win all of the states carried by Mitt Romney in 2012, plus Florida, Iowa, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, giving the Republican nominee 290 electoral votes to Clinton\u2019s 248.\""}

Republicans also kept control of both houses of Congress. Trump is to take the presidential oath in January.\nTrump won at least 290 electoral votes, while Clinton won 228, according to the AP (Associated Press) \u2014 270 were required vote to win the election \u2014 though Clinton won more national popular votes, 47.7% compared to Trump's 47.4%. Trump won the crucial electoral votes of Ohio, Florida, Pennsylvania, and North Carolina. The electors of Pennsylvania and Wisconsin had not supported a Republican presidential nominee for more than a quarter century, but in this election between them they provided Trump 30 electoral votes. \nAccording to law, the citizens vote for an elector in the state who promises to vote for a particular candidate. In most states, the candidate who wins most votes in a state wins all electors of the state. Different states have varying numbers of electors, which depend on the state's population. Since there are 538 electors in the US, one needs to win an absolute majority of the electors, that is, at least 270. Due to the electoral college, a candidate can win the presidential election even if he/she receives lesser national popular vote.\nIn her concession speech on Wednesday, Hillary Clinton said, \"We owe him [Donald Trump] an open mind and a chance to lead.\" Clinton also said, \"We've spent a year and a half, bringing together millions of people from every corner of our country to say with one voice that We believe that the American Dream is big enough for everyone, for people of all races and religions, for men \"and\" women, for immigrants, for LGBT people, and people with disabilities; for everyone.\"\nPresident Barack Obama had called Trump \"uniquely unqualified\" during the election campaign, but, after the president-elect victory of Trump, Obama met him in the White House yesterday and said, \"My number one priority in the coming two months is to try to facilitate a transition that ensures our president-elect is successful.\" After the meeting, Trump tweeted, \"A fantastic day in D.C. Met with President Obama for first time. Really good meeting, great chemistry. Melania liked Mrs. O [Michelle Obama] a lot!\"\nFollowing the unexpected result of the election, people protested in various US cities, often chanting \"Not my president\". On Wednesday, more than 60 people were arrested in New York, and a crowd blocked the entrance of Chicago's Trump Tower. Lily Morton, a 17-year-old student protester, said yesterday, \"This generation deserves better than Donald Trump [...] The queer people, colored people, women, girls, everyone that is going to be affected by this, we need to protest to help them. There is still love in this country.\"\nDuring the voting, huge traffic on the Canadian immigration website resulted in a site crash, officials said. Justin Trudeau tweeted, \nLast year, after the Paris attack in November, Trump commented on [[Muslims saying, \"Donald J. Trump is calling for a total and a complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country's representatives can figure out what the hell is going on.\" He also said, \"our country can not be the victim of horrendous attacks by people that believe only in jihad.\" But after winning the president-elect, the statement on Trump's website was removed, and it redirected to the donation page. \nTrump partisans defended Trump saying those proposed actions were to insure safety rather than targeting any religion.

He became chairman in May and is a prominent industrialist nationally, heading up major organisations. Saigol had been working for free, PIA said on December 12 ahead of his resignation.\nThe government has offered his job to several candidates, all of whom have turned it down.\nAnother issue for the airline comes in the form of a recently-submitted notice in the . Filed by the People's Party of Pakistan, it describes an 'illegal' sale of a PIA to a German firm. Senator Saleem Mandviwalla said the jet had a valid certificate of airworthiness and originally went to Malta to be used in a film. \nMandviwalla said the plane ended up in the hands of a German museum and was sold without the PIA board's consent. Federal Minister said the aircraft was sold for for 290,000 s despite being worth millions. Mandviwalla has called for a criminal investigation.\nIn the continuing Safety Investigation Board's investigation into Flight 661's crash, a team of French and Canadian experts from ATR reached Islamabad on December 12 and took forensic samples from the wreck site. The team, assisting the safety board, was also there to plan wreckage removal.\nThe crash site is remote, with conventional vehicular access ending several kilometres away. Rescuers had to walk the remainder.\nPIA state the aircraft was maintained in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions, including engine changes. The airline also say the crashed plane's engines were inspected, as standard, ahead of its final flight. An airline spokesperson asked journalists to refrain from speculating on the accident's cause.\nBodies have been identified using DNA analysis, with at least sixteen returned to families. Identification was undertaken by the (PIMS).\nThe dead included six members of the same family, leaving behind a fourteen-year-old girl. Haseena Gul is entitled to tens of millions of rupees (equivalent to hundreds of thousands of ) in compensation and numerous people have come forward claiming to be her relatives; she had remained with a friend in Chitral to study while her family travelled to Islamabad.\nGul is currently receiving treatment from PIMS for psychological problems. \"They will not let me study in Chitral,\" she appealed to the government. \"Please have me shifted to Islamabad where I can study and fulfil my parents' dream.\"\nAlso on board was , a celebrated popstar who abandoned music in favour of preaching after joining . Jamshed ran a nationally successful fashion business. His wife joined him on the flight. Other passengers included Osama Warraich, who was a senior civil servant in Chitral, and two infants.\nOn Monday, Flight 898 to diverted to . A replacement aircraft reached its destination over four hours late. PIA denied media claims the original plane suffered bursts in its hydraulics, but did not clarify what had happened.

There are now scientists calling for the largest cheetah subspecies to receive \"endangered\" status on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN)'s .\nThe US reports an estimated worldwide population of 100,000 cheetahs in the late 19th century. The new study, led by (ZSL) researcher Sarah Durant, with contributors including the (WCS) and , indicates a decline of more than 91%. Most of the remaining cheetahs live in most of Africa, more than half in southern Africa, while is found in Asia, including a small part of Iran, though these are seen much more rarely.\nAccording to the study's authors, the habitat preservation strategy that can be so effective in other species does not work on cheetahs because of their wide range. About 77% of wild cheetah's ranges are outside protected areas. According to Cheetah Conservation Project Zimbabwe, Zimbabwe's cheetah population dwindled from an estimated 1,500 in 1999 to 150\u2013170 in 2013\u20132015, a roughly 85% decline. The group based its survey on such resources as photographs, tourist sightings, safari guides, cattle herders, and village chiefs.\nThe (\"Acinonyx jubatus venaticus\") has been nearly eliminated in Asia; under 50 Iranian cheetahs remain. The cheetah subspecies went more than fifty years ago, says .\nThe new study asks the IUCN to change the status of cheetah from \"vulnerable\" to \"endangered\" in an effort to protect cheetahs. The IUCN lists both the (\"Acinonyx jubatus hecki\") and the Asiatic cheetah as \"critically endangered\" in their Red List.\nCauses of cheetah decline have been mostly habitat loss, killings of cheetahs by humans, human hunting of cheetah's resources such as , illegal fur trade, illegal cub trafficking, and roadkill. According to the , about 85% of an estimated 1,200 trafficked cheetah cubs have died within the past ten years, perishing en route.\nTheir exotic aesthetic renders cheetah very valuable. A trafficked cub can fetch $10,000, according to the BBC. According to DW, cheetah skin and meat are valuable as well.\nComplicating conservation efforts, cheetahs are carnivores and difficult to maintain in captivity. According to one report, the 77% of wild cheetah habitat is outside the range of protected wildlife areas and reserves. The cheetahs' secretive nature makes finding conclusive evidence on cheetahs difficult, says Durant.\nCheetah is the world's fastest springing species and predator. One cheetah was recorded sprinting at per second. They slow down if needed to hunt, and can maintain high speeds for hundred of metres. The running speed of cheetahs has not prevented their decline."}

The CIA report said this was to turn the 2016 presidential election toward president-elect Donald Trump. The alleged spies have been declared \"persona non grata\"; they and their families have until Sunday to leave U.S. soil but are not under arrest.\n\"The United States and friends and allies around the world must work together to oppose Russia's efforts to undermine established international norms of behavior, and interfere with democratic governance,\" said Obama.\nEarlier this year, hackers broke into the private servers of both the Republican and Democratic political parties but only released negative information about the Democratic presidential candidate, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.

Trump enjoys a warm relationship with Russian president Vladimir Putin expressing both admiration for Putin personally and tolerance of his official decisions, such as the .\n\"It is time for our country to move on to bigger and better things,\" said Trump of the interest in the hack. \"Nevertheless, in the interest of our country and its great people, I will meet with leaders of the intelligence community next week in order to be updated on the facts of the situation.\" \nTrump previously expressed skepticism regarding Russia's responsibility for the hacks, having said they could have been committed by \"someone sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds.\" Of the CIA, which issued the report, \"These are the same people that said Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction.\"\nThis places Trump at odds with many other members of the Republican Party, such as senators John McCain and Lindsey Graham, who issued a joint statement calling for investigations into Russian interference in U.S. elections. Unlike the Democrats, who have largely applauded the expulsions, most Republicans wanted a much swifter and harsher response. \n Paul Ryan said Russia has paid only a \"small price\" for the hack, asserting that Obama has been too soft on Russia throughout his presidency. The expulsions, unlike economic sanctions, do not apply to the country as a whole, only to specific people and organizations.\nTrump has praised Putin's decision to wait until Barack Obama is out of office before responding to these sanctions as \"very smart.\""}

Scientists had thought dinosaur eggs were more like those of modern birds than modern reptiles, but this long hatch time is far more reminiscent of than magpie. \nThe scientists reached this conclusion by comparing CT scans of the teeth of dinosaur embryos of two different species, the ', which had eggs weighing under 200 s, and ', a type of duck-billed dinosaur that had eggs twenty times that size.

He thanked his family and the nation, spoke of the need for unity, noted the country's accomplishments and need for improvement in areas like education and civil rights, and spoke about the need for pride in U.S. accomplishments, citing milestones of U.S. history and of his presidency specifically. \"It's why GIs gave their lives at and ; Iraq and Afghanistan \u2013 and why men and women from to were prepared to give theirs as well.\"\nThe president also addressed his country's troubled history with race and racism, an issue many black citizens feel he has avoided. Despite this, Chauncy Devega of \"Salon\" described the president as \"a role model of calm, cool reflective black masculinity: a man utterly at home in his own skin.\" Obama described the concept of a U.S. \"unrealistic\" and particularly cited the need for reform in education and the criminal justice system and greater acceptance of scientific evidence, particularly evidence supporting action to counteract climate change.\nHowever, publications including \"The Washington Post\" and \"Salon\" have given particular focus to another aspect of the president's address: the country's increasing political tensions and controversies involving access to news and information, both accurate and inaccurate. \"We become so secure and our bubbles,\" said Obama, \"that we start accepting only information, whether it's true or not, that fits our opinions instead of basing our opinions on the evidence that is out there,\" calling this trend \"a third threat to our democracy.\"\nThe \"Washington Post\" characterized Obama's comment, \"If every economic issue is framed as a struggle between a hard-working white middle class and an undeserving minority, then workers of all shades will be left fighting for scraps while the wealthy withdraw further into their private enclaves,\" as a \"not-so-subtle jab\" at the campaign tactics of President-elect Donald Trump. \"The Telegraph\" describes Obama's warnings about the need to protect democracy as \"a thinly veiled slight to the divisive rhetoric of Donald Trump's election campaign, which included attacks on Muslims, the disabled, women and immigrants.\" The president went on to call on the public to \"reject the first dawning of every attempt to alienate any portion of our country from the rest or to enfeeble the sacred ties that make us one America. We weaken those ties when we allow our political dialogue to become so corrosive [...] We weaken those ties when we define some of us as more American than others when we write off the whole system as inevitably corrupt and when we sit back and blame the leaders we elect without examining our own role in electing them. It falls to each of us to be those anxious, jealous guardians of our democracy.\"\nDespite this, when the mention of Donald Trump brought boos from the crowd, Obama reiterated the importance of the long history of peaceful transfers of power from one president to the next: \"No no no no no. [...] I committed to President-elect Trump that my administration would ensure the smoothest possible transition, just as President Bush did for me.\" However, this was not unaccompanied by a call to action. Near the end of the speech, he insisted citizens dissatisfied with elected officials should \"lace up your shoes, grab a clipboard, get some signatures and run for office yourself.\"\nOverall, the departing president's speech focused on accomplishment, echoing the \"Yes we can\" slogan from his 2008 campaign: \"If I have told you eight years ago, that America would reverse a great recession, reboot our auto industry, and unleash the longest stretch of job creation in our history. If I had told you, that we would open up a new chapter with the Cuban people, shut down Iran's nuclear weapons program without firing a shot, take out the mastermind of 9/11[...] If I had told you that we would win a marriage equality and secure the right to health insurance for another twenty million of our fellow citizens. If I had told you all that, you might have said our sights were set a little too high. But that's what we did.\"\nBut when the crowd began shouting \"Four more years! Four more years!\" Obama, with a small laugh, answered, \"I can't do that.\""}

LAPD charged Fernandez with trespassing; earlier reports indicated vandalism charges were ruled out as he used black and white tarps to alter the letter \"O\" to read lowercase \"e\". The sign was not physically damaged. \nA court hearing is scheduled for February 15. Fernandez said this act was an art project, and claimed he faces up to six months in prison if convicted. It took Fernandez two hours to alter the sign. Regarding conviction, he said, \"I'm a person of integrity. If I do something wrong, I will own up to it.\"\nExactly 41 years ago, on the same date in 1976, then-university student Daniel Finegood modified the sign to read \"Hollyweed\" for an art class assignment. Finegood returned to change the sign again in 1990, spelling out \"Oil War\" to protest against the First Persian Gulf War. Fernandez, on Tuesday, said his act was to \"bring light and positivity and happiness\". He said he was inspired by Finegood's modification to the sign.\nCity Councilman David Ryu said in a statement. \"Pranks of this nature deplete the resources of our valuable public safety personnel\".\nThe term \"weed\" is an English slang term for cannabis, a banned drug in many countries. On November 9, a ballot for legalising recreational use of cannabis in California for the age group of 21 and above was passed. The law legalising recreational cannabis is due to come into effect in 2018."}

Although president-elect Donald Trump has called for a \"repeal and replace\" plan, saying that a new health care system would be enacted \"almost simultaneously,\" many in government and the press have expressed doubts about whether this would actually happen.\nSenator of Maine said she would like to at least see a well-constructed plan before voting and Senator of Georgia said repealing Obamacare without replacing it was \"unacceptable.\" These concerns were shared by members of the House of Representatives. \"We need to be voting for a replacement plan at the same time that we vote for repeal,\" added Representative of North Carolina. Representative of New Jersey agreed, saying, \"We're loading a gun here. I want to know where it's pointed before we start the process.\" \nAnna Merlan of \"Jezebel\" and Anthony Taylor of the Associated Press dismiss Trump's timeline as \"impossible\" given the complicated nature of U.S. congressional workings. Senator Collins agreed, saying \"I don't see any possibility of our being able to come up with a comprehensive reform bill that would replace Obamacare by the end of this month. I just don't see that as being feasible.\"\nThe Affordable Care Act, which is often cited as a key accomplishment of the , has had a mixed reputation, and many conservatives believe a market-based health care system would be more flexible and efficient and less costly, and many believe that the Affordable Care Act only passed because of Obama's later discredited pledge that no one who liked their current health plan would have to switch. Matt O'Brien of \"\" claims a large tax cut that would result for the wealthiest 1% of citizens if Obamacare funds were not converted to other purposes, estimated at about $32,820 annually per person by the , is also a significant motive.\nRepublican Senators set a date of January 27 to repeal Obamacare, according to \"NBC News\". House Majority Leader of California says legislation repealing Obamacare and replacing it could ready by late February. According to Democratic Senator Bernie Sanders, as many as 30 million people could lose their health insurance if the ACA is repealed."}

One set stimulated prey pursuit behavior, such as stalking, and the other stimulated the animal to use its jaw and neck muscles. When exposed to the laser, the primed mice would first stalk and then pounce on and bite any object in their enclosure, even objects without any food scent or prey value, like sticks and bottle caps.\n\"We'd turn the laser on and they'd jump on an object, hold it with their paws and intensively bite it as if they were trying to capture and kill it,\" says lead investigator and Yale Associated Professor of Psychiatry . The mice behaved normally at all other times.\nThe work was inspired by Araujo's desire to study natural feeding behavior, as opposed to animals passively munching on food pellets. The study covered many parts of the brain already known to be associated with feeding, and the results suggested some areas are associated with both hunting and feeding and others only with just one behavior. Stimulation of the (PAG) portion of the brain controlled stalking and stimulation of the controlled biting. The researchers say this shows the amygdala is likely to control hunting and biting behavior across many or all jawed vertebrates. The experiments were funded by national research organizations in the United States and China and the government of Brazil.\nThe findings inspired comparisons by the research team and the press to zombies from \"\", especially since the behavior was more pronounced when the animals were hungry. Researchers noted the subjects did \"not\" attack any of the other mice.

The military said at the time a jet mistook refugees for rebels.\nThe new toll updates previous estimates, which at the time of the incident were of at least 50 dead. The BBC on Tuesday reported an official told them the figure of 236 was erroneously reached by combining the numbers of dead and wounded. The camp in Rann, is home to thousands and lies near the northeastern border with Cameroon.\nHome to those displaced by Boko Haram insurgents, the camp is in an area suffering famine. Farmers are unable to work owing to bombs on their land. The Red Cross was there to distribute food when the attack happened. Twenty Nigerian Red Cross workers were injured or killed. M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res are treating the majority of the wounded in makeshift tents in Rann, which lacks hospital facilities. A small number have been evacuated to Maiduguri.\nMilitary officials said at the time the had been dispatched to Rann after reports of \"remnants\" of Boko Haram in the area. The military claims it is in a \"final push\" against the rebel group. A promised investigation has materialised in the form of a panel of Air Force officials, with orders to complete the probe by the end of next week.\nHuman Rights Watch have called for compensation for victims. They say the military is not absolved of liability and suggest the camp's tents were obvious. Eyewitnesses say the aircraft circled twice, dropping multiple bombs, which appears corroborated by satellite imagery. President Muhammadu Buhari called it a \"regrettable operational mistake\" and has since departed for a holiday in London.\nJournalists are barred from the military-controlled camp. Officials claim all the dead in Rann have been buried, and two more died in hospital in Maiduguri. Most of those killed were women and children. Soldiers were also amongst those killed. Eyewitnesses claim two days after the disaster in excess of 100 Boko Haram militants attacked the camp, fighting with soldiers for hours.\nMSF field co-ordinator Alfred Davies said, \"There are no words to describe the chaos[...] I saw the bodies of children that had been cut in two.\" MSF have called for \"a transparent account\" with the organisation's general director complaining refugees \"were bombed by those who were meant to safeguard them\". Some humanitarian groups have suggested the incident constitutes a war crime even as an accident, and Human Rights Watch is urging an independent probe. They say 35 structures were destroyed at two separate locations within the camp.\n\"We saw dozens of patients with multiple traumatic injuries, including open fractures and wounds to the abdomen and chest,\" said MSF doctor Mohammed Musoke. He described wounded children, including a crying baby with shrapnel in its neck and \"a 10-year-old boy with a large, deep flesh wound to his thigh. The flesh was hanging loose on one side and you could see through to the bone.\"\nSurvivor Baba, 37, a refugee, said military aircraft were not an uncommon sight but the attacking jet behaved abnormally. \"The plane flew back and forth, and we knew something was wrong before the bombing happened.\" His remarks were released by MSF.\nPrior to the attacks camp residents had been starving, some dying from malnutrition. War and substandard infrastructure left Rann isolated, and the attack came as the Red Cross were about to distribute food they had just arrived with. The Red Cross say they have five weeks' worth of food.\nThe International NGO Safety Organisation claims 2016 saw in excess of 90 aid workers killed worldwide, with 154 injured."}

That stay was rejected early yesterday morning.\nJudge Robart ruled against the order on the grounds that there was no evidence it was \"to protect the U.S. from individuals\" described in the executive order. This follows the temporary suspension of this order issued a week earlier by another federal judge, , though while Donnelly's stay focused on preventing the deportation of travelers who had already reached the U.S. or were at that time en route, under Robart's ruling, approximately 60,000 revoked visas are to be returned to the people to whom they had been issued, not all of whom had already left for the U.S. People whose visas were physically taken away must apply for replacements. Yesterday, several Middle Eastern airlines had already begun to board passengers, and refugee flights were expected to resume today.

He was considered the elder Kim's heir apparent but lost favor after an incident in 2001 when he used a fake passport in an attempt to visit Japan.

Malaysian authorities have refused to release Kim's body to North Korea without a DNA sample from a family member. Khalid has promised police protection for any relative coming to Malaysia to do so."}

The collision attack demonstrated an algorithm for making two distinct inputs map to the same hash output, putting at risk the usage of SHA-1 for verifying data integrity. Google published a blog post and made a website about the collision attack.\nA successful attacker would be able to add a malicious file to the system to damage a backup relying on SHA-1 for checking data integrity, deliver a malicious update to clients using SHA-1 to verify the update file, attack and decrypt an encrypted connection to a website where the user's browser is using SHA-1 to identify the connection certificate, replace a file revision history using SHA-1 to identify commits, and perform other actions that would substitute for valuable files with something seemingly identical but misleading or malicious in practice. Similar systems not using SHA-1 would not be affected.\nTo demonstrate the success of the algorithm, Google published two distinct (PDF) files with identical SHA-1 hash. Google recommended everyone who uses SHA-1 to switch to or , stronger cryptographic hash functions.\nThe group started with a paper published by Marc Stevens in 2013 in which the authors proposed a theoretical algorithm for the collision attack. They chose PDF files as the basis for their attack. They wrote a PDF file prefix on both files and PDF contents which hashed to the same SHA-1 digest. Then they used the Google computing infrastructure to perform more than nine quintillion (upwards of 9,223,372,036,854,775,808) SHA1 computations. They described this as 6,500 years of CPU time distributed in the first phase, then 110 years of (GPU) time total in the second phase of the attack to reach full collision. They said this new algorithm was 100,000 times faster than the and 50 times faster than a algorithm proposed in 2005.\nThe cryptology group at the (CWI) institute, Netherlands, collaborated with the Google Research Security, Privacy and Anti-abuse Group to achieve the collision. According to a press release, and were the initial leaders of the initiative, Ange Albertini developed the PDF attack code, Pierre Karpman developed the cryptoanalysis, Yarik Markov and Pierre Karpman developed the distributed graphical processing unit (GPU) code, and Clement Baisse checked the reliability of the programs.\nGoogle also provided a collision detector online, where users can upload a PDF file to test whether it was tampered with for reaching a collision. Alex Petit Bianco developed the online file collision detector. Following its security policy, Google set a 90-day delay before the release of the source code for the attack.\nOperating systems and software rely on SHA-1 for verifying the file integrity when distributing updates to its users and in ISO checksums. Developers use SHA-1 in their , such as , to verify the files' integrity. Many people install programs that use SHA-1 for detecting duplicate files on storage media and for verifying backups' integrity. People surfing the web see SHA-1 used for verifying the integrity of certificates to verify the users' connection with the website is not subject to a . People also use SHA-1 in email / signatures.\nSince January, does not trust SHA-1 certificates. stopped trusting them yesterday.\nSHA-1 was introduced more than twenty years ago."}

Children with higher than usual volumes of cerebrospinal fluid in the subarachnoid space \u2014 the area just around the brain \u2014 were more likely to be diagnosed with autism later in life, with a strong correlation in the high-risk group. Ultimately, cerebrospinal volume was able to provide an early diagnosis of probably ASD in high-risk children with 70% accuracy. The six-month-old babies who later went on to a diagnosis of autism had an average of 18% more CSF by volume than those who were not so diagnosed. This built on the findings of a 2013 study that covered only 55 children.\nResearchers said it is not clear whether a large amount of cerebrospinal fluid actually causes autism or not. While studies have shown that cerebrospinal fluid, once thought to act solely as a cushioner and shock absorber for the brain, can influence the way neurons grow, Shen speculated that the large amount of fluid may itself be a symptom: \"We believe that extra-axial CSF is an early sign that CSF is not filtering and draining when it should. The result is that there could be a buildup of neuro-inflammation that isn't being washed [a]way.\"\nCurrently, coauthor said, children are not diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders until they are old enough for their behavior to change, usually at two or three years old. Researchers said these findings could be used to develop an early diagnostic system usable when the patient is as young as six months old."}

This was followed late last night by a similar ruling from Judge in Maryland. Residents of Libya, Sudan, Somalia, Iran, Syria, and Yemen who have legal visas may still enter the United States as normal. \nPresident Trump has called this \"unprecedented judicial overreach\" and pledged to challenge these rulings and defend the travel bans, even to the point of a Supreme Court case.\nThe ban differed from President Trump's first travel ban, which was also blocked by federal judges, in that its ban on Syrian refugees entering the U.S. is no longer indefinite, and it barred residents of six Muslim-majority countries from entering the U.S. instead of seven, omitting Iraq. It specifically omitted language about making exceptions for religious minorities. Still, Judge Watson concluded that a reasonable and disinterested person would be likely to conclude that the order stems from a \"purpose to disfavor a particular religion, in spite of its stated, religiously neutral purpose.\"\nAs evidence of this, Judge Watson pointed to Imam Ismail Elshikh, an American citizen and resident of Hawaii whose mother-in-law was attempting to get a visa to come to the U.S. from Syria.\nLawsuits against the travel ban were also filed by the Northwest Immigrants Rights Project in Washington and by the American Civil Liberties Union in Maryland. The Washington case is being heard by District Judge , whose order blocked the first travel ban. Arguments against the travel ban include the idea that it harms business, such as Seattle tech companies, that hire highly trained immigrants. , , and joined the Hawaii case as plaintiffs. The states of Oregon, California, New York, Maryland, and Massachusetts are also involved in challenging the ban. The suits make extensive use of President Trump's campaign statements, in which he promised voters he would keep Muslims out of the country. After the first executive order was struck down, he also spoke vehemently about the judicial system.\nJudge Watson was appointed to his position by former president Barack Obama."}

Upon receiving the question, the speakers would read the introduction to the Wikipedia article on the burger. According to a report by \"\", responding to the commercial's launch, Wikipedia users vandalized the article, with statements like \"The 'Whopper' is the worst hamburger product sold by the international fast-food restaurant chain Burger King,\" or that it contains \"rat and toenail clippings\", all of which would be recited by the speaker.\nAmidst the spree of edits to the article, a Wikipedia user named \"Fermachado123\" edited the page to reflect positively on the burger. A report by \" noted similarities between the user's name and Fernando Machado, senior vice president for global brand management at Burger King. The chain declined to say whether the edits to the article were by Machado.\nThe commercial subsequently prompted responses from Wikipedia and Google, with the former locking its article from editing by unregistered users, and the latter preventing its speakers from responding to the commercial. According to a report by \", Google may have used the sound clip of the actor's voice to disable the commercial's ability to activate the speakers, as other people were still able to get the devices to respond to inquiries about the burger.\nBurger King later bypassed Google's restrictions on its commercial, by releasing new versions of the spot. The chain revealed the new versions on ' and ' on Wednesday night. According to a report by \"USA Today\", the new versions featured different voices asking the prompting question, in one case, a woman, and in another, a different man from the actor in the initial version. Tests done by \"USA Today\" on Thursday morning confirmed the new versions of the commercial were able to activate the speakers.\nBefore airing the new commercials, Burger King expressed awareness the original spot no longer triggered the speakers, and teased the subsequent versions through a statement on Wednesday by spokesman Brooke Scher Morgan. \"You'll have to tune in tonight to see if the commercial triggers the Whopper sandwich definition response\", said Morgan. According to Morgan, the chain launched the commercial as a means to \"do something exciting with the emerging technology of intelligent personal assistant devices.\"\nIn a post on Twitter dated to Wednesday, software developer Anthony Kirkpatrick criticized Burger King's approach, writing, \"re: that burger king ad, yeah relying on linking to wiki text through an assistant definitely can't go wrong or be misused in any way\".\nAnother tweet, by user Dawn Xiana Moon, dated to Thursday stated, \"Burger King fail. Hijacking devices isn't cool. It's clever, but it's not going to win friends.\" \nUsers on YouTube also took the commercial's comments page on the site to vent their frustration with the approach taken by Burger King, citing concerns regarding privacy incursions through the remote activation of the speakers. \"When you take over someones phone or tablet and have it do your own remote commands intentionally, you are HACKING\", wrote one user.\nAccording to marketing professor , a faculty member of the 's Wharton School, who authored the book \"Contagious: Why Things Catch On\", Burger King potentially gained patrons through the publicity generated by the commercial. \"This is particularly valuable to Burger King rather than, say , or someone else,\" said Berger, \"because Burger King wants to be known as an edgy restaurant or establishment that does interesting, creative and different sorts of things. It's part of their brand equity\". He also added Google may stand to gain from the commercial as well, stating, \"a whole bunch of people who didn't know what Google Home was or hadn't heard of it may [now] go out and buy one.\"\nPrior to the release of the commercial, Google caused a similar incident during the Super Bowl, when its own commercials activated the speakers because they contained the \"Ok Google\" trigger phrase. On the possibility other advertisers may attempt to repeat Burger King's actions, Berger had this to say: \"Just like any other marketing campaign, the first time someone tries something, it's creative, innovative and everyone says it's great[...] But two weeks from now, if every brand is doing this with every ad, people are going to start getting pretty annoyed.\"\nIn a statement by e-mail on Thursday, Dara Schopp, a spokeswoman for Burger King, indicated the commercial resulted in a 300% increase in Twitter \"social conversation\" on Burger King, in comparison to statistics from the previous day.\nWhilst Google declined to comment to \"The Washington Post\" on the question, they reported an individual unofficially indicated the company was not consulted by Burger King prior to the launch of the commercial."}

Officially, Comey was fired for mishandling the issue with former presidential candidate Hillary Clinton's alleged , but Senate Democrats and the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) have raised concerns over whether the real reason may have been that Comey was leading the investigation into the Trump campaign's alleged ties to Russia and possible tampering with the election that placed Trump in high office.\nCNN reports a source within the White House told CNN reporter the President's office gave this reason intending to avoid controversy because many Democrats have also criticized Comey for mishandling the Clinton case, and some have blamed him for Clinton losing the election. Specifically, recently confirmed Deputy U.S. Attorney General released a memo criticizing Comey's statements in a July 2016 press conference, in which he called Hillary Clinton \"extremely careless\" for using private email servers to transmit government information but said she would not be charged with a crime. \"The director was wrong to usurp the attorney general's authority on 5 July 2016, and announce his conclusion that the [Clinton] case should be closed without prosecution. [...] Compounding the error, the director ignored another longstanding principle: we do not hold press conferences to release derogatory information about the subject of a declined criminal investigation,\" wrote Rosenstein. \n\"It simply defies logic that President Trump, who made the FBI investigation of Hillary Clinton's emails a centerpiece of his campaign, would all of the sudden convert to the view that Clinton was treated unfairly,\" said Democratic Senator . CNN legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin rejected it as \"absurd.\" He went on to compare it to the dismissal of during the .\n of the ACLU also expressed concern: \"The independence of the FBI director is meant to ensure that the president does not operate above the law. For President Trump to fire the man responsible for investigating his own campaign's ties to the Russians imperils that fundamental principle.\"\nMost Republicans agreed with Trump's decision. Senator said, \"The handling of the Clinton email investigation is a clear example of how Comey's decisions have called into question the trust and political independence of the FBI.\" However, Republican Representative referred to the rationale behind the dismissal as \"bizarre\" and said that he and his staff would look into laws that might allow the establishment of an independent commission to continue the Russia investigation. Such a commission has also been called for by Republican Senator John McCain and Democratic Senator .\nMinority leader Chuck Schumer said, \"If deputy attorney general Rosenstein does not appoint an independent special prosecutor, every American will rightly suspect that the decision to fire director Comey was part of a cover-up.\"\nSchumer was one of several Senate Democrats to ask for a special prosecutor or special counsel. Others, expressing themselves both by Tweet and traditional television interviews, of Virginia, of Oregon, and of New Jersey. However, special prosecutors are appointed by the U.S. Attorney General, in this case Jeff Sessions who recused himself from any further involvement in the investigation into the Trump campaign's ties to Russia. According to ABC News chief legal analyst , the responsibility would then fall to a deputy, who would be unlikey to act except in response to pressure from Congress.\nPresident Trump responded, as is his custom, via tweet: \"Cryin' Chuck Schumer stated recently, 'I do not have confidence in him (James Comey) any longer.' Then acts so indignant. #draintheswamp\" and \"The Democrats have said some of the worst things about James Comey, including the fact that he should be fired, but now they play so sad!\" \nDeputy Director is to serve as acting head of the FBI until a replacement is confirmed."}

There are concerns the Russians may reverse-engineer the process by which the information was gathered and identify the source. Because many of the countries in the Middle East have tribal-level connections to areas controlled by the Islamic State, allowing a source to be identified could place them in political as well as personal danger.

The new data shows that different colors of light are being blocked at different intensities. Therefore, whatever is passing between us and the star is not opaque, as would be expected from a planet or alien megastructure.\"\nThe research team analyzed 22 months of data collected by an array of ground-based telescopes that covered many wavelengths of light. The study period lasted from March 2016 to December 2017, which included a number of decreases in brightness. The first dip started on the night of Thursday May 18. A robotic 14-inch telescope at in Arizona watched lose brightness by a dramatic 3% by Friday, confirming a prediction the star would undergo its unusual dimming events once every 750 days. Other major telescope projects and citizen astronomers confirmed these findings. That dip was complex and continued through to the following Sunday, after a brief rise in brightness over the weekend. It ended a few days later, with Boyajian and fellow astronomer and co-author of the recent paper Jason Wright discussing the phenomena with the public via Twitter: \"will we have a flurry of dips to come? Stay tuned!\" \n\"Tabby's star[...] went through a lot of very strange dimming events that got up to 22% dimmer during the Kepler Mission, and since then we've been eagerly awaiting another dip. And the reason that we\u2019ve been waiting for that is that whatever is causing the star to get dimmer will leave a spectral fingerprint behind,\" said Dr. Jason Wright of Pennsylvania State University, after the May event, now a co-author of the current work. \"So if it's a lot of dust between us and the star that's passing by, it should block more blue light than red light. If there's gas in that dust, that gas should absorb very specific wavelengths. So we've been eager to see one of these changes, these dips in the star, so we can take the spectra.\" He also addressed space fans at the time via Twitter: \"ALERT:@tsboyajian's star is dipping This is not a drill. Astro tweeps on telescopes in the next 48 hours: spectra please!\"\nThe primary mission of the Kepler project monitored more than 150,000 stars with the primary goal of detecting exoplanets. If a star gets dimmer but then recovers, a planet may have passed in front of it. But Tabby's star has shown something else. An exoplanet can cause its sun to dim by perhaps 1% and not for very long. Some of Tabby's dips have been this mild, but others have hit 20% and lasted weeks. It also tends to recover only partially, slowly showing a net dimming over the years.\nThe plethora of hypotheses behind Tabby's star has made it a favorite among space fans and both professional and amateur astronomers. Space dust was one of the many hypothesized explanations, but if that's the reason, its origin was and remains a mystery with stargazers speculating many giant comets could be on elliptical orbits or breaking up in front of it or the dips in brightness could be aftereffects of the star . Some even hypothesized alien civilizations might have been harvesting the sun's energy using a . The (SETI) devoted some observation time to Tabby's star in the fall of 2016 as part of the project.

Cosby, who is black, is charged with drugging and sexually assaulting a white woman.\nProsecutors claimed that one of the potential jurors, a black former police officer who had once sued the state, might have an anti-government bias that could skew her judgement in trial. The judge overseeing the case, Steven T. O'Neill, decided to accept the prosecution's explanation but told Cosby's lawyers he would entertain their accusations of racial bias if they came back with statistical evidence. Of eleven jurors seated as of yesterday, ten were white and one was black. Out of the 100 potential jurors examined, sixteen were non-white and about a dozen were black. Of the eleven, seven were men, four were women. One juror and six alternates had yet to be selected.\nNearly 3000 residents of Pennsylvania's have been called to report for jury selection for just one trial. After selection, eighteen of those people will be bused about 300 (500 ) to where the trial of Bill Cosby for the alleged 2004 sexual assault of is scheduled to begin on June 5.\nThe area around Pittsburgh was chosen as as source of jurors at the request of Cosby's legal team, who were concerned about the interest that politicians elsewhere in Pennsylvania have shown in the case.\nJudge O'Neill, was present for jury selection: \"No one should make an effort to be on this jury, and no one should make an effort to not be on this jury,\" he instructed the first set of 100 potential jurors.\nThe first round of winnowing was done by questionnaire. Potential jurors were asked if they had religious beliefs or experiences with criminals that might affect their ability to serve impartially. Jurors were asked if they or anyone they know has been sexually assaulted, and about a third said yes. Jury selection specialist Howard Varinsky, who worked on the and cases, said the judge would be likely to dismiss jurors who said yes to that question; and said defense lawyers would likely favor black jurors who might question the veracity of reports from police officers and older jurors who may see Cosby's alleged victim as an adulteress.\nUnder Pennsylvania jury selection rules, either side may reject any number of jurors \"for cause,\" meaning either that they have some health problem or work obligation that would make jury service an undue hardship for them or that there is some proof that they could not be impartial. Someone who has admitted to hating or loving Cosby could be struck for cause. Each legal team may also strike seven jurors and three alternates regardless of their reasons, which they are not obliged to share with the court. However, they are not allowed to exclude jurors solely because of their race or gender, which is what Cosby's lawyers allege the prosecution attempted to do Tuesday.\nOver the past few years, about 40 women have accused Bill Cosby of drugging and sexually assaulting them. One woman besides Constand is expected to testify to establish that Cosby's actions were part of a predatory pattern. Cosby claims his encounter with Constand was consensual and says he hopes to restore his reputation and career. If convicted, Cosby, who is currently 79 years old, could serve 10 years in prison.\nBill Cosby is best known for his role on \"The Cosby Show\", which earned him the nickname \"America's Dad.\"\nJudge O'Neill has already decided to the jury for the trial, estimated at about two weeks."}

Prosecutors immediately announced plans to retry the case.\nBrian McMonagle, one of Cosby's lawyers, addressed the jury, \"We came here looking for an acquittal but like that song says, 'You can't always get what you want. But sometimes you get what you need.'\"\nThe jurors had deliberated for a total of 53 hours, longer than the testimony of all witnesses combined. They had already declared themselves deadlocked Thursday morning, at which time Judge O'Niell told them to return to deliberations and try again. On Friday, they emerged to request copies of previous testimony and phone transcripts.\nDuring their deliberations, the jury asked to review the testimony of alleged victim Andrea Constand, particularly her testimony about the 2004 night the alleged assault took place, which produced over 300 pages of transcripts. Constand claims that, in 2004 when she was working for , Cosby invited her to his home, where he gave her pills that left her \"immobilized\" and unable to speak and then touched her breasts and genitals and placed her hand on his exposed genitals. Cosby claims their contact was consensual and that the pills he gave her were ordinary Benadryl, though he has admitted on-record that he gave women for sex in the 1970s. Cosby was accused of three charges of indecent assault, these being assaulting Constand without her consent; whilst she was unconscious; and after using drugs to impair her ability to give consent. On each charge, a guilty verdict could have placed Cosby, now 79, in prison for up to ten years. Many other women have claimed that Cosby assaulted them as well, with specifics ranging from inappropriate touching to rape, but the for many of these complaints has expired, meaning that the crime happened too long ago for the government to legally prosecute Cosby. However, Pennsylvania law does allow for the testimony of such victims in other sexual assault trials, and one of these women, Kelly Johnson, testified in last week's proceedings.\nConstand did file a complaint with police in 2005, and the district attorney at the time, , decided against charging Cosby. Constand then sued Cosby in civil court and the matter was settled with an undisclosed sum. However, during his deposition for this civil case, Cosby admitted on the record to giving women quaaludes.\nWhen asked why he thought the jury was unable to come to a unanimous verdict in this case, former Philadelphia prosecutor Kevin Harden Junior said that the jurors probably had doubts regarding Constand's credibility and cited the fact that only one of Cosby's other accusers had been allowed to testify: \"By limiting evidence of other accusers, the Court focused the jury on whether the prosecution presented enough credible evidence to convict Cosby of this particular assault. [...] It would be reasonable, based on the evidence presented, for the jurors to agree that Cosby is a sexual predator and still disagree on a verdict as to the assault of Constand.\"\n law professor Carl Tobias commented on the prospects for a new trial: \"The fact that the case turned substantially on one person's testimony may have made it difficult to win and the defense counsel made many efforts to undercut her testimony. The retrial happens next, and the prosecution may try to call other accusers.\""}

The discovery was reported online in the \"\" journal.\nThe astronomers say the planet's surface temperature is more than 4000\u00b0 (7232\u00b0), nearly as hot as the Sun. The planet takes about 36 to 48 hours to orbit around its star, KELT-9. KELT-9 is about two and a half times larger than the Sun and nearly twice its temperature. The star is about 650 from the earth, but it is about 300 million years old. KELT-9 is a blue , which shines brightly but, unlike some other stars such as our own Sun, their life span is on the order of millions rather than billions of years. \nAbout a year ago, NASA reports, at the in Arizona, observers using the KELT-North telescope noticed a minute drop in KELT-9's brightness \u2014 about 0.5%. This pattern was observed once every one and a half days, implying the planet comes in between the line of sight of the star from Earth, meaning the planet completes one revolution in that time period. Observations using the Hubble telescope could reveal whether the planet possesses a comet-like tail, which could help the astronomers estimate how long the planet may live. \nProfessor Gaudi told the BBC the planet KELT-9b \"is about three times the mass of Jupiter and twice as big as Jupiter.\" He said the team discovered the planet in 2014. He added, \"it took us this long to finally convince ourselves that this truly bizarre and unusual world was in fact a planet orbiting another star\". \nMuch like the Moon is to the Earth, KELT-9b is to its star; with one side of the planet always exposed to its star. Due to tidal locking, the planet's surface temperature facing the star is roughly 4300\u00b0C (7772\u00b0F), more than the surface temperature of an average Red Dwarf star. Its close proximity to its parent star exposes it to ultraviolet radiation, and according to the calculations, the planet loses planetary material anywhere between ten billion to ten trillion grams each second. Professor Gaudi said, \"It's a planet by any of the typical definitions of mass, but its atmosphere is almost certainly unlike any other planet we've ever seen just because of the temperature of its dayside\".\nAccording to Keivan Stassun, a professor of physics and astronomy at , Tennessee, \"KELT-9 will swell to become a red giant star in a few hundred million years\". Professor Stassun directed the study with Gaudi. The discovery was a collaboration between Ohio State University, Vanderbilt University, , and the .

Then , now 10, was born, and the debate lapsed.\nNaruhito has only one child , 15, while his brother , 51, has three children, including his only son Hisahito. Per current law, Hisahito is qualified to ascend after his uncle Naruhito and his father.\nThe royal family has 19 living members, including seven unmarried princesses and five males. Female royals, if marrying a , would have to give up their royal status, leaving the royal family, while males would still be allowed to retain their royal status after marrying a commoner. Akishino's daughter announced her plans last month to relinquish her royal status and leave the royal family in order marry a commoner Kei Komuro, a graduate student and law firm worker, both of them aged 25. In 2005, Mako's aunt and Naruhito's sister , married a commoner Yoshiki Kuroda, a town planner, and was forced to relinquish her status and leave the family.\nA professor Jeff Kingston said a national succession crisis has people raising concerns about female princesses leaving the royal family when getting married. Kingston added the family \"[has] a shortage of male heirs.\" Kingston also said ousting a female royal for marrying a commoner is \"a very old-fashioned approach, totally out of sync with 21st-century norms\" to many people around the world, including in Japan.\nIn a survey by conducted in May of about 3000 people at least 18 years old, 68 percent said the Imperial Household Law should be amended to allow future emperors to abdicate. 25 percent favored separately legislating each abdication. Four percent said abdication of emperors should never be allowed.\nOn questions involving female royals, 86 percent said to allow empresses; 59 percent supported both empresses and established branches of female lineages. 62 percent supported establishment of separate branches for princesses retaining their roles while marrying commoners; 35 percent opposed. 61 percent said female ascendance should be debated only after the abdication, while 28 percent said it shouldn't wait for the abdication.\nEarly this year, the Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe considered giving imperial status to branches of those who left the royal family. In the survey, 22 percent supported the idea; 72 percent opposed.\nThe Abe government has avoided the debate of female ascendance but recently passed a non-binding resolution attached to the newly passed abdication law to consider how to strengthen female royal status, possibly including allowing them to retain their royal titles and continue their duties, to compensate for the declining royal population."}

The protests came after several instances where people were killed due to mob violence, the victims mostly from the minority communities of Muslims and Dalits. Protesters held placards with messages such as \"No Place for Islamophobia\", \"Break the Silence\", and \"Shed Hate not Blood\". Saba Dewan said, \"the protest is against this systematic violence against Muslims and Dalits that is going on in our country at the moment\". The protesters presented poems, songs and danced on stage on the Jantar Manter to express their views. , New Delhi's deputy chief minister, also took part in the protest.

The mob, reportedly threw Junaid's skull cap, and called them \"beef eaters\" and \"anti-nationalists\". About twenty people were involved in the violence.

At least ten Muslims have been reported victims of the mob violence in the past two years, for beef consumption or transporting cows. Cow is considered sacred in Hinduism and many Hindus in the country view cow as a god or mother. Beef is banned in several states of India and a person found guilty for killing a cow can face a prison term up to ten years. But often, the \"gau rakshaks\" (cow protectors) have taken the law in their hands and lynched the accused. Some of the claims turned out to be false.\nThough India is a secular state, Prime Minister Narendra Modi of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which shares Hindu nationalist views, vowed to ban beef across India. In 2015, ex-Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister said, \"Do I assault everyone who eats pork or alcohol?\" after Rashid Ahmed was beaten by BJP members for serving beef in a private party. Pork and alcohol are considered and hence, their consumption is prohibited in Islam.\n\"Killing people in the name of 'gau bhakti' [cow devotion] is not acceptable\", Modi said yesterday."}

Iraq is no longer included. Border officials have been instructed to honor existing visas, but in general no new ones are to be issued. Although some lawyers showed up to volunteer their services, U.S. airports continued to operate smoothly, without the huge scale of protests that marked the first attempt to enforce the travel ban.\nA United States Supreme Court ruling handed down Monday said the ban was legal so long as it made an exemption for anyone with \"credible claim of a bona fide relationship with a person or entity\" already in the country. The Trump administration is counting parents, in-laws, children and step-versions of these as bona fide relationships and, at the last moment, added fianc\u00e9s, but discounted grandparents, grandchildren, cousins, nieces and nephews. The attorney general of Hawaii has challenged the administration's definition of close family as too strict.\n\"The banning of grandmothers \u2014 of unaccompanied children \u2014 from America's shores is a disgrace,\" said David Miliband of the International Rescue Committee.\nUnder the current ruling, people with businesses or in ongoing educational programs are also allowed to enter or re-enter the country, and permanent residents of the United States are exempted. Although lower courts declared the travel ban tantamount to religious discrimination targeting Muslim-majority countries, the Supreme Court disregarded both those concerns and President Donald Trump's tweets about his plans to bar Muslims from entering the United States. They declared instead the President has \"a compelling need to provide for the nation's security\" that includes the right to control immigration. The Supreme Court is to give the travel ban more in-depth consideration when it reconvenes this coming October. "}
