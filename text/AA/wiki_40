As reported by Sky News, state media says the diversion was due to threat of explosives on board, a claim calls \"dubious and still unverified\".\nTotal restrictive measures varied between the countries and regional organisation. Canada sanctioned 17 new individuals for a total of 72, and five entities described in a press release as being \"due to the ongoing disregard for human rights demonstrated\".\nThe EU, through the Council of the European Union, extended its restrictive measures by 78 individuals and eight entities related either to human rights violations or the \"forced and unlawful landing\", to a total of 166 individuals and fifteen entities. Those who are impacted, including judges, businesspeople, university rectors and government ministers, will be subject to an asset freeze, and persons affected prohibited to enter or transit through EU territory.\nThe measures also prohibit EU citizens and companies from making money available to the designated. According to the Associated Press, EU policy chief said the measures \"are going to hurt [...] the economy of Belarus heavily\".

In addition to concerns of the country's \"transnational repression\" and \"affronts to international efforts\", the US also cited the \"fraudulent\" as cause for the sanctions' imposition.\nThe timing of the sanctions was questioned by Belarusian Nikolai Shchekin on state media network the , noting the date June 21 is one day before the anniversary of the start of the German invasion of the Soviet Union, or the \"Great Patriotic War\". According to CNN, the US attempted to announce its sanctions earlier, prior to a meeting between US president Joe Biden and president of Russia Vladimir Putin, but was held up by the EU."}

Peru also abstained, but due to its lack of government, reported \"The Guardian\".\nThose that have signed represent over 90% of global (GDP). A press release by the OECD called the framework the result of \"negotiations coordinated by the OECD for much of the last decade\" and criticises the \"century-old international tax system\" for being \"no longer fit for purpose\". The plan was backed by United States president Joe Biden according to multiple sources, and comes after a similar deal on international taxation agreed on June 5.\nThe plan, officially the \"OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting\", adopted a pillared approach. An implementation plan is to be finalised by October.\nIf implemented, the first would force multinational enterprises (MNEs) with global turnover exceeding \u20ac20 billion and profitability above 10% to reallocate tax on over USD100 billion in profit from their home markets to each market jurisdiction it derived at least one million or 250 thousand euros from, depending on its GDP. An OECD statement confirmed the threshold for affected MNEs under pillar one may change to those exceeding ten billion euros in turnover, dependent on the results of a review to be conducted in seven years' time.\nThe second pillar consists of two \"Global anti-Base Erosion Rules\" allocating top-up tax of a minimum of 15%, and one treaty-based \"Subject to Tax Rule\" to be made effective in 2023.\nThe effects of both pillars, though dependent on the plan's final framework, was estimated by the OECD to increase global corporate income tax (CIT) reserves by between 1.9 and 3.2%, or 50 and 80 billion USD. If including the existing US tax on global intangible low-taxed income, the growth of CIT reserves would be between 2.3 and 4%, or 56 and 102 billion USD. This would also protect against tax avoidance practices the OECD says costs countries between 100 and 240 billion USD in lost revenue per year, according to the AP.\nThe OECD also projects a \"relatively small\" negative effect on investment and activity equivalent to 0.1% of GDP in the medium- to long-term. Other concerns cited include the potential governments may lose the ability to use tax incentives for policy objectives, as well as the cost of ensuring compliance. \nCountries opposed include Hungary and Ireland who have, according to \"\", sought lower rates to attract , and have, in addition to Estonia according to the BBC, at least some corporate rates below the proposed floor of 15%. The Irish and Hungarian headline corporate rates stand at 12.5 and 9%, respectively, according to \"The Guardian\", with Ireland standing to lose over two billion euros in the next four years according to (RT\u00c9). A tax summary mentions a tax exemption on undistributed corporate funds in Estonia, in addition to instances where a 14% rate is applicable.\nOECD secretary general said in the press release \"this historic package will ensure that large multinational companies pay their fair share of tax everywhere\", adding while it \"does not eliminate tax competition [...] it does set multilaterally agreed limitations\".\nBiden said the deal means the world is in \"striking distance of full global agreement to halt the race to the bottom\", which US treasury secretary described as a race \"no nation\" has won, according to \"The Guardian\". Finance minister for France called it the \"most important international tax agreement in a century\", according to the BBC.\nAccording to RT\u00c9, finance minister for Ireland said while he \"expressed Ireland's reservation\", he remains \"committed to the process\" and assures the global community \"Ireland will continue to play our part in reaching a comprehensive and, indeed, historic agreement\". According to Reuters, on June 9, Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n called the proposal \"absurd\", and insisted the country's low rates \"is not meant to attract certain companies to declare their taxes here\", nor makes it \"a tax haven\".\n, Italy is to host G20 finance ministers and central bank governors at a \"G20 High-Level Tax Symposium\" on July 9, according to the Italian ."}

In addition to being a chartered planning and development surveyor and assessor to the Society of Chartered Surveyors, Dr Sirr is a and former external examiner for the , according to his profile on .\nDr Sirr was a lecturer and former head of research for the Faculty of the Built Environment at the , which entered a merger with two partner institutes to become TUD January 1, 2019. He received his in estate management at the , United Kingdom, and in urban design and in town planning at the . He has a second master's in literature from KU Leuven, Belgium, and speaks .\nInterview with Lorcan Sirr.\n By most measures, Ireland is a far wealthier country than it was decades ago, yet the cost of rent and owning one's own home has been steadily on the rise. A Q1 Daft.ie price report found the average monthly rent in Ireland is up to EUR1443. Broadly speaking, to what do you attribute this to?\n One of the main reasons for rents rising significantly over the last decade has been the increased use of the rental sector for . So, social housing is typically housing that's provided by the state for people that can't afford their own housing. And traditionally what has happened is that the state builds houses for people who need housing. And increasingly, they've not been doing that, but instead they've been placing families who need housing into the rental sector.\nSo, what they're doing there is, they're putting a lot more demand into the rental sector, constraining supply, and then rents are going up. So, if we got rid of the government's practice of using the private rental sector for state housing or for social housing, you would find that there's a lot more supply available, and that is a huge driver of rents.\nThe other driver of rents, of course, has been that, about four years ago, the government introduced a new system whereby rents could be increased annually up to a maximum of 4%, but of course when you introduce a maximum, the maximum quickly becomes the target. So, every landlord just increase[s] their rent by 4% every year. So over a number of years 4% on 4% on 4% on 4% adds up to significant rental increases.\n Now, you're saying, 'the 4% the 4% the 4%', I know the [government] opposition, and , even before the [COVID-19] pandemic, they've been advocating for a temporary, I believe, ban on rent increases, or just a rent-freeze overall. Do you think that would help the situation?\n It depends on what you mean by 'the situation'. It would help tenants, without a doubt, it would help tenants \", because suddenly they'd have a rent-freeze and their rents would be stuck where they are.\nWhether it would benefit the sector overall is a different thing\u2014whether it's constitutional is a third thing\u2014but, so, it would benefit tenants. Would it benefit the system overall? If landlords aren't able to make a return on their rents, there is an increased chance that the landlords will leave the sector. Now, the house is still there, but the house will go for home ownership or for something else. So, you know, at a more [economic]-level, maybe that wouldn't be the best thing to happen.\nAnd the third issue is that constitutionally there has been a court case in 1982, Blake [v.] the , which said that rent-freezes, \"per se\", are unconstitutional. So, you're beginning to trickle in legal ground by doing something like that. Having said that, what they've brought in\u2014it happened today, actually; [it] comes into effect today\u2014is rents are now linked to the ; basically . And that happens, today.\n Daft.ie relates the COVID-19 pandemic to the situational cession of construction activity and the second-hand market. Do you expect these variables to change in the coming weeks and months?\n Funnily enough, last year, you know, we had built 21 thousand houses in 2019, and we kind of thought that last year, because of COVID[-19], we might get 12 or 13 thousand houses: these are really small numbers, like. But we got 20 thousand houses, I think 20 thousand houses in the last year, which was really surprising, it was nearly the same as the year before. So, COVID[-19] didn't really stop that much housebuilding activity. It didn't really have the change, the impact that we thought it was going to have.\nYeah, the construction industry are quite [fortunate] that construction sites [are] open-air, should be allowed to be open and remain open, and they kind of won their case a lot of the time. But, the other thing is like, do we expect these variables to change in the next months? I don't think we'll ever see. You have a lot of people out there who say we need 33 thousand houses a year, 48 thousand houses a year, whatever, all that numbers.\nThe market isn't going to supply more houses than it can sell, and over the last four or five years it has been selling the same number of houses every year: about seven or eight thousand houses. Out of the 20 thousand houses, only about seven or eight thousand come on the market for sale for ordinary people. And that's about right, that's about the level where prices are stabilising, at seven or eight [thousand]. If they build any more houses, sales prices will fall because they've increased the supply. And so, I think builders are quite clever and that, no matter what happens with COVID[-19], right, I still think we're only going to churn out 20, 22, 24 thousand houses every year. Because if they churn out any more than that, they're going to oversupply the market \u2014 and negatively impact the sales price. So they're very clever about maintaining, drip-feeding the market like that.\n Speaking of the prices, residential property prices rose by 4.5% the year to April, in a range from 0.5% in apartments in Dublin to 8.5% in houses on the border with the North [of Ireland; Northern Ireland], according to the . Do you expect this to change as post-pandemic consumer price inflation\u2014European harmonised inflation\u2014eases more broadly?\n Well, you've got to remember the places like , and that you're referring to now with the 8.5%, they are starting from a really low base. So 8.5% is coming from something very low, so it's 8.5% of something low anyway, so [in] those areas, 8.5% doesn't scare me at all. It's more in the large cities, or, we don't really have large cities, but in the cities, our price rise is moderating.\nAnd the interesting thing that's driving the sales prices outside Dublin is COVID[-19], and the idea that a lot of people have decided that, \"instead of living in a city, and now that we can , I'm going to move back to [the] Border, Midlands, wherever I'm from originally where I can buy or get free land and buy a big house that I could never buy or build in Dublin, blah blah blah, and do that\". And that's driving prices, with the people moving to other areas.\nHow long that will last is the other question. I don't know: I think a lot of employers will want a return at some stage, but I think we haven't fully thought out this idea [of] working from home, I think we're only [in the] very early stages of it. So I'm not sure of those price rises will sustain themselves over the next few years. I think there could be a moment of excitement at the moment, where people are going: \"oh great, I can get out of the city, I can buy a cheaper house back in the countryside, and I'll do that\", but, you know, pretty soon I think people will realise they want to be back in the city, or the excitement will wear off of that, and only a certain number of people do that, and the rest of the people stay in the cities.\n What are your thoughts on the government's \"Rebuild[ing] Ireland\" initiative?\n \"Rebuilding Ireland\" was the government policy from 2016 until this year, actually, last month. So it's finished now, it failed. It had five main pillars, like reusing stock, ending homelessness, all that stuff. It failed on all the pillars. It didn't hit any of its targets, and one of the problems with it was that it was very simplistic in many ways, and very much driven by quantity over quality. So, it was all about numerical targets, and it didn't matter if the houses that were built under these numerical targets were connected with public transport, they had local infrastructure, they had services \"et cetera\", \"et cetera\". That didn't matter, that was secondary; the most important part was to get numbers of houses up, you know, get those numbers, hit those targets.\nSo, very simplistic. We're [a] first-world country, we're quite a wealthy country. We should be doing better planning than, you know, the target is 25 thousand houses a year, let's hit 25 thousand, and it doesn't matter if they're not serviced by public transport, it doesn't matter if they're not sustainable development, it doesn't matter if they're in areas where they're not needed. You know, it was very much targets-driven, which is why it failed.\nSo, it failed on all their targets. So, you know, you need it better. We have a national planning policy that's telling us to do one thing in a kind of more correct, best-practice way, and then you have a \"Rebuilding Ireland\" housing strategy that's telling us to throw up houses everywhere as quickly as we can, and the two things do not compute, they're not compatible, you know. So we ended up with this mess, you know, as always.\n So you're saying that the numerical strategy is not the best approach. I don't know if you've had the chance to read this, but [on] 14 July the government published its Summer Economic Statement and it's included a promise for a Housing for All strategy that's \"designed to boost housing outputs\". So, what do you think is most crucial in pursuing that aim, if not strictly numerical?\n There's no point in building houses if it means that people are living far away from employment, for example, because you're building houses, but yet you're creating other pressures on traffic and congestion and forced car ownership and a whole lot of other issues. So, you know, it's not about the numbers, and in any event, one of the problems with these strategies is that it's one thing to have a numerical target if I have control over the numbers that are going to be delivered, because I am the state.\nThe problem with the Irish state is that it relies nearly entirely on the private market to deliver its housing output targets. You can't control the free market, you know, the market will do what it wants to do, so even though we might need 30, 40, 50 thousand houses a year, if the market decides that 20 thousand houses is the optimal level, that's all they're gonna build. And the state can't force them to build 40 thousand, so one of the problems with \"Rebuilding Ireland\" and having a targets-driven system is that targets are fine if you are in control of the delivery of the targets, but targets are pointless if you're relying on someone else to deliver those targets for you. And that was where we went wrong with that.\nSo I think, with the new Housing for All strategy, I haven't seen it, and I know there's arguments in the government about how much money should be allocated towards it, but I mean really, if it's going to achieve what it wants to achieve, the state needs to take far more control over the delivery of housing. Because if you don't have control over it, you lose control over quality, you lose control over costs, you lose control over timing, and by relying on the market, these are all lessons that we know from 20 years ago, but we're a bit dumb in that we don't, kind of, learn the lessons that we should be learning.\nSo we're back again relying on the market, and then, you know, you just lose control over everything.\n What would you recommend the government do then, for its Housing for All strategy? It hasn't been published yet, but what would you personally think would be best, just in trying to solve [through] the strategy? \n Yeah, I think we already have a lot of lands and we already have a lot of vacant housing in Ireland. We have an incredibly high rate of vacant housing, and the government seems to be reluctant to tackle either land that we have \u2014 a lot of land owned by the state itself, not even private land \u2014 and the reuse of existing housing. Like, we don't even tax people who leave properties empty, for example. I could leave my house in Dublin for ten years and nobody would tax me, nobody would say anything to me. And that's crazy, you know, when you have a housing shortage, like how could you let people leave their houses empty in a housing shortage? But we do! We can, in Ireland. There's no way to, kind of, penalise people for doing that.\nAnd we don't charge really, we don't charge a meaningful property tax. So we're very reluctant to interfere with people's ownership of property and people's usage of property. So, we have land, and we have a lot of empty housing. I think really what has been happening over the last ten years is an increased centralisation over the control of the delivery of housing, so in other words, taking away power from local government\u2014we have very weak local government anyway, like councils and town councils\u2014and bringing it back to a centralised government department.\nReally, what needs to happen is responsibility for the delivery of housing needs to go back to a local level, and put responsibility on councillors and mayors and people like that to deliver housing, not having it done from a central office up in Dublin.\n What are your thoughts on the Affordable Housing Bill [2021], which was defended by the Minister [for] Housing[, Local Government and Heritage] as \"empowering local authorities to deliver affordable homes [for] purchase on their own lands\"?\n Yeah, it's kind of interesting because it's doing the opposite of what I was talking about, like. So I'm, you know, saying \"give more power back to councils\", and at the same time the Minister is taking power away from councils on the disposal of land. He's, you know, forcing councils to give up good land they have zoned for housing to a centralised body, and really it's the opposite that needs to happen.\nA lot of the affordable housing stuff still brings in the private sector. And when you're bringing in the private sector you're bringing in profit, and the more you bring in, the less affordable the housing becomes, because the private sector has to make a profit, that's understandable. Well, unless you're kind of willing to do it yourself, then you need to use the private sector and the affordability comes out the window. So really, what the government's been urged to do by opposition and even by its own internal members is to borrow, at a time like now when money is quite cheap to borrow, to borrow more money and build housing ourselves, and forget the private sector. Let the private sector look after the private sector, and let the state look after the state.\nBut we've mixed up the two for so many years now that we're finding it hard to disentangle ourselves from our reliance on the state.\n The Residential Tenancies Act [2021] which, as you said, comes into effect today, it ensures that the rent pressure zones can increase with the consumer prices. It has been challenged by the opposition obviously, just because they think that it's unfair on tenants, and that sort of thing. What are your thoughts?\n Well actually, a lot of the opposition people were in favour, I know Sinn F\u00e9in were very much in favour of an inflation rate-related rent change system. I mean, I think it's better than the current system: when you set an upper limit, a ceiling, of what rents can go, so in our case it was 4%, that just becomes a target for landlords. So landlords go, \"well, the most I can increase it by is 4%, so I'm just going to increase it to 4%\", and everybody does, and then rents go up, and suddenly that's the market rent, so the next year you can increase your rent by another 4%, and the rents all go up and up by 4%.\nLook, when you have an inflation one, at least it's more broadly related to your expenditure on everything, and it should take some of the sting. Now, having said that, inflation has been rising over the last few years, so what I would have liked to have seen would have been inflation, related as it is as of today, inflation-related rent increases, but with a cap of, say, two-and-a-half or three per cent on it. I would have liked to see that, because if inflation does take off, and say we get 6% inflation, then we're in a worse position than we were before when it was only 4%.\nBut in principle, I think I would be supportive of inflation[-related] rent increases. And I think most of the opposition would be too.\n You wrote in ' on 24 July, 2016 on the obsolete housing rate \"[h]ousing policy deserves a better evidential basis.\" Could you speak more to this?\n What I meant with that was, for a start, we didn't know how many houses we were counting every year. We're very bad at data, so we didn't know how many houses we were building every year, we couldn't count them. We didn't really know how many empty houses we had, and we didn't know [of] how many obsolete houses. So, obsolete. So, we have houses that we live in, we have empty houses like vacant houses, so, I'm away on holidays and my house in Dublin at the moment is empty, that's a vacant house, and then we have obsolete houses.\nSo, obsolete houses are houses that are, effectively, uninhabitable. Houses that we have let fall into a huge state of disrepair, so that nobody can live in them: so there's no water, no electricity. It's just, you know, windows, no rooms, whatever. And we have a huge problem with that. Our rate of obsolescence is about four times the international norm, so we're letting an awful lot of buildings that could be potentially reused go un-reusable, if you know what I mean.\nWe're letting them fall down. [The computer is moved to the outside of his building.] You see this building here? That is part of an old farm, and that was a building that was almost obsolete, and the people spent some, borrowed some money and refurbished it, and now they rent it out on or whatever. [The computer is brought back inside.] And that's the way to do it, like. It's a perfectly good building, it's a beautiful building. It's huge and it's really nice and it's really well-done, and, like, we have thousands of houses every year that we let fall into a state that they can't be reused. And we didn't know how many we were doing it [to].\nSo, in other words, we have a potential stock of housing that we're just letting rot and letting fall away, and that's what I was talking about in \"The Sunday Times\", that we need to capture that data about how many houses that we're letting fall obsolete, and get a strategy to reuse them, and to, kind of, bring them back to life. Because not everybody wants a new building, and you can't rely on builders to build every new building, you know, all the new buildings we need. So, we also need to sort of capitalise on our existing housing stock.\n And who do you think should be held responsible for fixing these dilapidated buildings? Do you think it should be the private sector and the private people or the local government or the national government?\n I think it's not really a kind of a punishment exercise, if you know what I mean. I think this is probably a situation where a lot of people will have, say, you know, an example, this area I'm in, there's a farm next door and they own this building. Maybe they didn't have the money, maybe some farmers, maybe some people who own obsolete or derelict buildings don't have the money to do it. So I think there should be probably a process whereby we can give them a grant, and help them bring the buildings back to use, and then, you know, over 40 years they can repay the loan or repay the grant or whatever.\nBut I think it can't be just a punishment, we can't just tax people for letting buildings fall out, I think we need to help them bring them back in use again, as well. So, .\n You wrote again in \"The Sunday Times\" that September, and in fact, we've actually been talking a bit right now about, you know, Dublin and the cities, the government under the Taoiseach Enda Kenny has been focusing too much \"on crowd-pleasing, anti-urban policies that can never work\" with regards to its growth centres and . What are some policy ideas you think could work in, you know, de-incentivising that sort of thing?\n Yeah, so traditionally Ireland has been a fairly rural country, you know, and have dominated politics in Ireland for a long, long time. We didn't have cities like they did in the UK, so we didn't have an . Like, in the UK they were building big cities in the 1830s, 1840s, 1850s like Manchester, Leeds, Birmingham and, you know, London grew and all those kinds of places. We didn't have any of that! Now, Belfast did, which is like 150 miles up the road, because that was part of the United Kingdom and Belfast grew a , industrial city, but Dublin never did.\nThe Industrial Revolution bypassed us because we've had and prime ministers who had no interest in cities. We don't have an , you know. We don't know how it is to manage a city, we don't even know what a big city really looks like, you know. You come to Ireland and it's like, what we call cities, like, they're just towns, you know what I mean. Like, the whole population of Ireland is just a suburb of somewhere in Singapore, you know what I mean. The scale here is tiny, and we've never had an interest in, kind of, you know, in developing our cities and developing how they should work. So, it's always been, kind of, the rural politicians have quite often got their way.\nAnd not only that, the people we've had managing places like Dublin have often been rural people, people from a rural background. So they're not even city livers or city dwellers: they weren't born in the city, they don't know how it is to live in the city.\nSo, you know, we've neglected our cities over the years. And it's getting better, but we have neglected our cities over the years. One of the things I think we could do is have lord mayors, with powers over the police and over urban developments and things like that. We don't do that, we don't do local government at all, and I think the most successful things, looking at European and international cities, is when they have strong local government, they have a directly-elected lord mayor, and if I don't like what the lord mayor has done in my city, I'm going to vote them out. Whereas we don't have that here. We have lord mayors, but they're nominal, they're kind of titular honorary kind-of positions; they have no power. So, everything is determined by the , and quite often they are wrong.\n Going back to the whole housing supply [question], you know, do you think the government should focus on, you know, incentivising people to move out of Dublin, or starting new jobs outside of cities, or?\n Yeah, I mean, for those who want it, absolutely. I think we should, you know, if it takes pressure off big cities, absolutely help them, kind of, move. But there's a caveat, and the caveat is: you don't let people move outside Dublin to live like where I am at the moment, which is a one-off house in the middle of the countryside, right. And if I want to get a pint of milk or a newspaper, I have to get in my car outside, I have to drive five or ten kilometres to the shop, right, and then back here, okay? That's crazy, it's not sustainable, you know, it's not economic, it's not clever. So you can't let them do that, but I think if you let them move out of Dublin and into towns and villages, absolutely, why not?\nRepopulate the towns and villages, rather than let people live all over the place.\n The voted recently for an amendment to a bill that would impose a 10% rate on \" or 'cuckoo funds' with an exception if they were purchased for the purpose of social housing. Do you think this will have a noticeable impact on the number of units available?\n That's a really interesting question, because I think the stamp duty rate, like exempting the funds from the stamp duty rate, is just nonsense, absolutely nonsense. These funds make so much money that paying the stamp duty will have no effect because when they're renting to the state, the state is the equivalent of having, you know, a tenant in your property, okay. The state isn't going to on the rent, the state will look after the property \"et cetera et cetera\".\nSo they're making so much money off the state, there was no need to cut the stamp duty. Previously, nobody wanted the state as a tenant because they were like \"poor people in houses, we don't want them.\" Now, the s have realised \"actually, having the state, having the local authorities and councils as a tenant to take 300 of my properties, that's a brilliant thing! Because they'll always be full, they're going to guarantee me 95% of market rent, and they're going to look after the properties and they will never default on the rent. The state will not default on the rent, so therefore, it's brilliant!\"\nSo as long as the state keeps doing the crazy stuff of renting properties rather than building properties, these funds will always come. So [it] probably will increase supply, yeah, but it's a bonkers policy because it's like living on your s, you know: you're constantly paying rent, and at the end of 25 years, you don't own the building. So, it's kind of a crazy practice for the state to get into, but that's what they're into.\n What do you feel about such a large pre[valence] of international, or just large investment companies' presence in the Irish housing market, overall?\n Yeah, I'm a bit worried about it because it's a smaller market, they have a disproportionate effect. In a large country like Germany or, I don't know where you're from. Where are you from?\n From [the United States of] America.\n In [the United States of] America, a huge market, right? Those funds are, like, so prevalent in the US and in Canada and places like that. I'm quite concerned about them because they tend to have so much money that they can crowd out the small landlords. In Ireland, the majority of our landlords are small landlords: ordinary people who happen to have a property that they rent out to somebody else. Like 90% of our landlords are small, they're not these large funds. I would be worried that these funds will come in, they'd crowd out the small landlords and they won't be competitive.\nThey won't introduce competition into the market because they're top-end, and they're only interested in the expensive product, and they won't bring down prices because they're not bringing in competition. I would rather they were, like in other countries in Spain and places, they're not allowed to be involved in the residential market. I think that's the correct approach, really.\n What are the features of a 'stable' housing market and 'optimal' buying conditions, in your opinion?\n To be honest with you, I don't think there's such a thing as a stable housing market really. You know, I've never known a market that's 'stable', not in housing. There's so many various things; housing's not like s and s, you know stocks and shares, they're pieces of paper. Housing is always changing.\nThe demand for housing is always fluctuating, the type of housing is always changing, our needs are always changing. Other issues impact housing: , , , , that all impacts on housing. So it's different to stocks and shares, which nothing affects really except the market demand.\nSo I've never known a stable housing market, to be honest with you, but one of the things that causes the greatest amount of instability is the idea [in] Ireland and other countries like us, like the UK and Australia; we have a system called , and that really means that the government will help you buy your house, and then you're looking after yourself. So, my house is my . In Ireland, each man, woman and child is worth something like USD180 thousand each, something like that, alright? More than half of that is in housing, in real estate property. So we rely on our property for our wealth. So when your parents die or when your parents want to send you to university, they can and send you to university, to get a loan based on the .\nSo we're relying on our houses for our wealth. In other countries, they rely on their housing for shelter. Yeah? I'm not talking about poor countries, I'm talking about a place like Belgium and things like that where the housing is not an asset, the housing is shelter, and like in time you sell the house, you don't make much money on it. Here, we're constantly relying on making money from our housing, so in our heads we always want to see prices rise. And that of course negatively affects everybody else, particularly young people who need to buy a house, so our approach to housing is one of, we know it's the wrong thing that we should be wanting our value [of] our property to rise, but yet, like, we all secretly want it because it means we're wealthier.\nAnd of course, you're doing nothing. Like, the price rises in housing are not anything I've done to my house, it's just because demand in my area has gone up, you know? So, it's kind of , and it's bad to rely on it because we're always looking for things that would keep prices high and not lower them.\n Do you think there's any country Ireland can look to as a role model?\n Every country except Ireland, I think, and maybe not the US. I think, like, no country has it perfect to be honest with you, and every country that I've looked at in, housing has good sides and it has flaws. I think there's probably more cities than countries that have done so; Vienna does it very well. The city of Vienna is really well involved in the delivery of seven thousand apartments every year for citizens of Vienna, and they get them at a subsidised rent and it's, you know, it's much more affordable.\nPlaces like Copenhagen have also done quite well on s, where people get together to build their houses. I think the like Ireland, the US, Australia, New Zealand, we have a very similar system of asset-based welfare and that's totally unhealthy and that's why we have these booms and crashes and booms and crashes. And unless we start taking the profit element or the asset element out of housing, we're always going to be like that. \nSo when you look at countries that don't have that kind of of housing, like the Danes and some of the Austrian cities, some German cities, some from the Swiss, you find a much more, this back to your previous question, a much more stable environment where the risks are in other parts of the economy, but not in housing. Whereas with us, one of the major systemic risks to our economy is housing, and it shouldn't be. Housing should be a given, housing should be just something that's there all the time like roads and electricity. But in Ireland it's not, it's up and down and up and down and it's a major threat to the economy.\n Do you have any other comments on the state of the Irish housing market?\n Well, we often talk about the Irish housing market as being dysfunctional, right? But I don't think there's any such thing as a 'functional' housing market. There's just so many variables, there's so many human, you know, interactions with it. The big variable now, of course, is the international money coming in that we can't control\u2014well, we could control, but we're not controlling it. So now not alone do we have and wages and employment and planning and all those things affecting housing, now we can have money coming in and effectively telling us what to do, and deciding rents, and so that's another, you know, it's part of , it's part of financialisation.\nSo, we're kind of constantly leading ourselves down a path which is really hard to get out of. And really what it's creating is kind of , because if you're a homeowner, you are increasingly getting more and more advantages over people who don't own homes, and of course homeownership perpetuates homeownership because, you know, when I die or when I'm older I'll be able to get a deposit together and help children buy their house, and they'll be able to help their children buy their houses. Whereas if you're never a homeowner, you can't do that. So [it] perpetuates social [in]equality.\nSo, we need to look at housing in a much broader way than just economics and money, we need to look at housing much more in terms of society, planning, and so on."}

The explosion occurred in South Los Angeles (L.A.), California, U.S. on East 27th Street, injuring seventeen and damaging vehicles and property.\nFive members of LAPD's bomb squad have been removed from duty, said Moore. \nOn June 30, LAPD officers discovered a cache of over 32 thousand lb (14,500 kg) of illegal fireworks at a South L.A. residence. Bomb disposal technicians responded by placing an estimated 16.5 lb (7.5 kg) of explosives, into a \"total containment vessel\", or TCV, where they detonated the material. According to the (ATF), technicians actually detonated 42 lb (19 kg) of explosives. The vehicle failed to contain the explosion and the blast injured seventeen people and damaged thirteen nearby businesses, 22 residences, and 37 vehicles.\nThe TCV's capacity was 15 lb (6.8 kg) for repeated use, or 25 lb (11 kg) for single use, according to Moore. The containment truck had been used by officials for ten years, with the June 30 blast its 42nd usage.\nATF special agents are also investigating the LAPD's actions. They expect to complete their investigation in the next one to two months.\nThe owner of the home where the fireworks were discovered, 26-year-old Arturo Ceja III, was arrested by LAPD and apprehended on suspicion of unlawful possession of destructive devices and child endangerment. Fireworks are illegal to possess in the City of L.A., and in unincorporated areas of . Ceja posted the US$500 thousand bail for release. He is due back in state court in October.\nFederal prosecutors charged Ceja III with the illegal transportation of explosives without a license. Prosecutors allege that Ceja III purchased the fireworks from Area 51, a fireworks dealer in , Nevada, on the border with California. He was released on US$25 thousand bond pending arraignment, scheduled for August 2.\nL.A. Councilmember criticized the LAPD's bomb squad in a statement saying, \"[i]t's clear there was negligence involved and this instance shows zero regard for the people that reside in our South LA community. Every individual that I have talked to including myself wonder if this would have been acceptable protocol in more affluent areas of the City.\"\nThe city opened a resource center for affected residents at the on East 28th Street, where residents can file claims against the city and receive referrals to mental health services. \nOn Tuesday L.A. City Attorney said his office received 56 claims against the city, saying, \"We're trying to speed this up as much as we can [...] this is an all-hands-on-deck effort to make sure that anybody who suffered because of that explosion gets relief as fast as possible, because they deserve it\".\nCallers to Tuesday's meeting called for the police department to make reparations to affected city residents and businesses. Moore told the commission there were over 200 applications for claims seeking assistance."}

She wrote an Op-Ed in the Sydney Morning Herald, arguing for a case against the so-called \"lockdowns\" - measures which the state governments in Australia were implementing to stop the spread of COVID-19. These measures included things like limiting the size of gatherings, directing certain business types such as gyms to close or operate at reduced capacity, limiting where people may travel and restricting residents to only leaving their home if they have a reasonable excuse to do so.\nIn New South Wales, these restrictions were implemented as Public Health Orders, signed by , the Minister for Health and Medical Research. Mr Brad Hazzard has authority make these Orders under the 2010, section 7.\n\"Wikinews\" reached out to Professor Gigi Foster, asking for comment.\nThe interview was conducted amid an outbreak of COVID-19 in New South Wales, that has resulted in an increase of restrictions from June 26. At the day of interview, residents were legally allowed to go outdoors only for essential shopping, medical care, and exercise, in groups of no more than two people unless of a common household.

Can you explain your role?\n I'm a professor with the School of Economics at the University of New South Wales, in Sydney, Australia. At the moment I am also serving as the Director of Education and Deputy Head of the School of Economics. I have a continuing research and teaching contract and have been with UNSW since 2009, when I came as a senior lecturer, in a lateral move from the University of South Australia.\nRelative to many professors, I engage a lot with the community and media on economic policy matters of the day. I also cofounded and co-run the Consortium for Inclusive Economics Education, housed within the UNSW Business School.\nI could go on about details but that gives you an overarching idea I think - any specific questions?\n Looking at a piece that Joel Carrett wrote recently in , I have a few questions. Firstly, 'living with the virus' as suggested seems worse than completely eliminating it and bringing the number of cases to complete zero. Is that a correct interpretation? Could you please elucidate further?\n \"living with the virus\" is inevitable, given what we now know about it. One big reason for this inevitability is that the virus was pass to animals, like domestic companion animals, mink, and so on. This means it is simply implausible for us to eliminate it from our world.\n It would seem to me that in Australia, elimination, at least among humans, is the preferred strategy, with the only new cases coming from overseas, normally. Do you consider that is the most optimal solution and if so, why? Are you familiar with cases of transmission to or from animals here?\n The rates of death from covid-19 for young people are in the same order of magnitude as seasonal flu - contra the mainstream media's portrayal - and we now have a toolbox full of ways to fight symptoms and lethality of the virus, including ivermectin, vaccines, and so on - which if deployed optimally will significantly reduce the danger that even our more vulnerable people face from the virus.\nYour comment also ignores the dangers and costs associated with continuing to focus uniquely on covid, while ignoring everything else that improves, prolongs, and strengthens human life.\nI would also mention that as the virus has been mutating - particularly into this new Delta variant - it seems to be becoming less lethal. This is yet another reason why the portrayal in the media, and the neglect of everything else that matters for human life and livelihoods, are inappropriate.\nIn relation to the fantasy world of keeping ourselves blocked off from the rest of humanity forever, first I'd say that we already have the virus here, so the elimination ship has sailed - and second, that shutting ourselves off from the rest of the world indefinitely will lead inevitably to a decline in living standards, happiness, innovation, productivity, and cross-cultural understanding with Australia, something that I would not wish on my worst enemy's country, much less on Australia, a country I love so much.\n What would you ideally like to see tomorrow, if you were in control? Increased availability of vaccines? Have you found some of the mainstream media narrative coercive or invasive to privacy? If so, who is atfrom your perspective, fault for that and how to best remedy that?\n If I were queen (which I hope I never am - monarchy is a worse form of government than democracy, because power corrupts - as we are seeing right now amongst Australian politicians!) I would (1) make the vaccine available to anyone in vulnerable groups who wants it; (2) change the message to \"We've got this virus's number; we know how to fight it; everyone, get back to life; (3) buy and disseminate ivermectin, and start randomised controlled trials of it and other potential treatments/preventative approaches to covid; and (4) open the borders and pledge to the Australian people that no domestic border closures, lockdowns, or other mandated restrictions of movements or activities will be put in place in the name of COVID-19.\nI would also start the process of reforming our institutions to protect the country the next time a situation like this emerges. I have several suggestions for that, which are contained in my forthcoming book, The Great Covid Panic.\nIn terms of your question about coercion, yes, some of the messaging around the vaccine has been manipulative, misleading, and coercive. Whether to get a vaccine should be a question for consideration by a patient and his or her GP - not a question to be decided by politicians, employers, or anyone else. From my reading, vaccinating the healthy young against COVID-19 with the vaccines we presently have available is likely to be worse for them, in expectation, than not vaccinating them and risking their exposure to the disease itself.\n When is the book planned to be released?\n [The] book should be available in about two months.\n In your piece at Sydney Morning Herald you discuss shelter in place orders and their effect on excessive deaths. One remark that relates to Australia: \"The only countries in which they observed a fall in the trajectory of excess deaths were Australia, New Zealand and Malta. \u201cAll three countries are islands,\u201d they reported. \u201cIn every other country, we observe either no visual change in excess deaths or increases in excess deaths.\u201d\" How would you comment? Why is there such a correlation for an island country?\n In the island countries that form exceptions in that recent piece of research, covid deaths are so minimal that they don't move the needle on excess deaths one way or the other.\n Do travel restrictions like 'do not go further than 10kms from home' helpful or not, in your view? And why? What is the logic behind 10, as compared to, say 9, or 11 kms?\n The reason for the decline in excess deaths in the initial weeks following the imposition of a shelter-in-place order in the island countries is that people stop using their cars as much (so, fewer traffic accidents), they stop having elective surgeries (which in the short run saves lives, as some such surgeries do end in death, sadly), and because they don't go to the bars and generally out and about, and accidentally kill each other. It has nothing to do with COVID-19.\nThe travel restrictions are an absolute nonsense from a human wellbeing perspective.\n From your view, how effective [were] the measures about limiting size of gatherings; closing some popular venues such as cinemas; social distancing and face masks requirements?\n More than anything, what they show you is the degree to which the way we are being governed at the moment stems from politicians' instinct to try to \"control\" and thereby achieve success - rather than looking at the data, facing reality, and trusting people to help each other and protect each other as best they can. Since the start of this whole period in history, in March 2020, I have advocated for targeted protection of vulnerable populations - and I still do. This means the targeted use of social distancing, sensible hygiene, etc., when vulnerable people are involved.\nFor the vast majority of people under 50 years old without health problems, this virus is the least of their worries.\nSo I do not support blanket restrictions on movement, gatherings, masking, etc.\n Do you have any comment on the number of people and conditions in which citizens have been required to self-isolate as per the contact tracing instructions?\n Contact tracing as a general principle seems to me unlikely to pass a cost-benefit test (which by the way is what the blanket lockdown policies should have had to pass, and never did, before being implemented). It's extremely expensive, and you just don't gain that much useful information that actually ends up saving lives or reducing suffering - which are the only things that matter. I can see a role for very careful staff rostering, testing (with reliable tests), etc in and around aged care homes, etc. Again, not for the whole population.\n Does that seem counter intuitive to someone who says 'but Jane visited a bar, and knowing the four other people there and asking them to isolate and get tested would help'? How can this narrative be disputed? With Jane being [infectious], as per a test on a next day\n If Jane and the others who decided to visit the bar were informed of the risks (which, if they are young and healthy, are low), then the government has no business interfering in their choice to go to the bar. Cases in healthy young people are arguably a good thing, as they allow the development of natural immunity - which is just as effective if not more effective than the immunity conferred by vaccines.\n If the current restrictions appear to be poorly thought through, how would you suggest to challenge them? Who - public, businesses, or someone else - can help, and how?\n Will we ever possibly lose a young person with COVID-19? Yes, of course, we may. Just as we lose a few young people with influenza, pneumonia, etc, every year. But the relative risks for young people particularly from keeping our societies locked up are just massive. Mental health problems, economic hardship, relationship problems, disruption to schooling and training, lack of celebrations of important life milestones... It is heart-breaking.\nIt is also heart-breaking for the older people we have isolated away from their families, to while away their final years alone. The vulnerable need to be offered the vaccine, to have full information and access to prophylaxis and treatment options, and then to rejoin their communities and have as much visitation from their friends and families as they wish. They need it. Social interaction literally saves lives. We are a social species and we ignore our social needs at our peril.\nIn terms of how to challenge the current policies, I am trying everything I can from my platform as an independent academic - I am writing, speaking on TV and radio, doing podcasts, etc. I also resist by not wearing a mask, and openly hugging people in public. We need, individually and as businesses, to show that we will not comply with these mad, destructive policies. If we love our country and want our way of life back, we will have to take it back by actively resisting the poor governance we are getting at the moment.\n Do you have anything important to add?\nPerhaps to say that the way eventually out of this mess, if Australians do not resist now, is that the rest of the world will get on with their lives and eventually we will get jealous enough that we will start demanding the same freedoms that we see others having elsewhere. So it's just a matter of when the pressure will become great enough to force the politicians' hands.\n One more question.. I've found none political activity going on in this direction.. the closest I could find is https://www.ldp.org.au/freedomday and it is ridiculous, some people dismiss it as a daft proposal.\n I looked at that petition. It looks sensible to me. What's not to like? I mean the idea of \"Freedom Day\" wouldn't have been my first pick as a vehicle - since that implies that we don't have freedom every day (which we should in a democracy like Australia).\n It is easy to misinterpret, a common reaction from a few people is \"what they should be lobbying for is to get everyone on the vaccination programme, only then is there a hope of getting rid of the lockdowns or extremely focused and limited lockdowns\".\n Hm interesting, well that tells me that they have been brainwashed into accepting the narrative that we indeed need to earn our freedoms, by getting vaccinated (and maybe doing other things too). That is not the right mental model. We do not have to earn our freedoms. We have them and simply need to empower ourselves to use them. Also, the idea (again) that someone other than a patient and his or her GP should be dictating that someone gets the vaccine is quite scary really. Do we really countenance having health decisions made for us by our governments?\n Alright, thanks for your time!\n Ok bye :)"}

Administrators were appointed by the Victorian state government in July 2019, who have governed the shire since then. However, South Gippsland's council is scheduled to be restored with an election to be held via post from October 5-22, 2021.\n\"Wikinews\" interviewed one of the candidates standing in this election, Sue Plowright. She is an independent contesting the Coastal-Promontory ward, which covers towns such as , , , , , and . The Coastal-Promontory Ward elects three councillors to the South Gippsland Shire Council.\nInterview.\n What do you hope to achieve as a councillor?\n I have four initial priorities to achieve in the three years the new Council will serve. The first is to contribute my ethical governance skills and knowledge to build a trusted and dynamic Council that is widely recognised for applying due process and being diligently accountable. South Gippslanders deserve a Council that acts with dignity and respect for the people and democratic processes. Achieving widespread recognition for very good governance practices, will, among other gains, enable Council to better attract funding, public, private and philanthropic, to resource opportunities such as community power projects, widespread shifts to regenerative farming, ensuring tourism is sustainable and sustainably supported and adequate community services care for the people of the Shire.\nSecondly, turning climate change into exciting opportunities rather than a divisive issue is a key goal I want to achieve. At a minimum, all councils have a legal obligation to tackle climate change as per the Local Government Act 2020, but the situation is urgent and so minimal responses are not enough but organisations like are a great role model - they\u2019ve been working bit by bit for example to fence off and revegetate rivers flowing into for 20 years or more through providing information, incentives and value adding for farmers and landowners.\nThe leadership of a switched on and dedicated Council can play a similar role, by connecting and enhancing all the small projects and initiatives that locals are already doing like the shared power project at . As a first action therefore, I will support a declaration of a climate emergency, accompanied by development of a community-led action plan that is then resourced in subsequent budgets, strategic plans and works to support and increase individuals and community initiatives.\nMy third priority is support for a full time youth officer/coordinator position in Council in order to facilitate a strong network of young people, services and volunteers to create spaces and events for young people, because I see shires like nearby Wellington Shire providing so many more opportunities. And fourthly, I\u2019m working with a group we\u2019re calling Mayday Projects to better utilise existing properties in the area to help alleviate the affordable housing emergency that we, along with many regional areas, are facing. I provide more detail about these two projects in question 6.\nIn summary, there are of course so many aspects to life in South Gippsland councillors will need to consider and address, thus a councillor\u2019s approach to decision making is important. My own golden rules are to seek out diverse perspectives though listening and talking to a wide range of community members and experts; thoroughly prepare for meetings through diligently reading briefings, research reports and doing my own research; being prepared to consider new possibilities; and work to enhance existing initiatives and good will by making connections.\n Do you think the two-year period that South Gippsland Shire has been governed by administrators since its\u00a02019 sacking\u00a0has been too long, and why/why not?\n From my position as a new observer of the Council when I moved to live full time in Toora in 2016, it became clear by 2019 that a circuit breaker was required. In the end, with so many resignations and countbacks the Council make up no longer reflected the choices of the people at the 2016 election, while acrimony and dysfunction appeared to overshadow any initiatives that were achieved. I think democratic elections are always a priority over any other model or arrangement of governance and so I do think elections in 2020 along with the majority of Councils in Victoria would have been desirable. However, the two years has given South Gippslanders time to rethink and reinvigorate how we do democracy and I lend my support to this important cause through standing myself and encouraging diverse others to do so also.\n , which takes up the majority of Coastal-Promontory ward's land area, attracts a significant amount of tourists on a yearly basis. With the COVID-19 pandemic and the current lockdown, there has been a large impact on local businesses. What do you think needs to be done to help business recover?\n Businesses facing the COVID pandemic are like a batsman/woman facing an incoming bouncer in cricket. Some have been able to put bat to ball and belt out a six and are thriving in the new circumstances, while for others the ball has bounced awkwardly. I'm a sole trader, having started my own educational consultancy practice in mid-2019. By the end of that year I was getting excited about what I could achieve with some interesting work in schools coming my way. But just when I was about to get cracking after the summer holidays in Term 1 2020, the first COVID lockdown hit, and the rest as they say, is history. I was not in a position to 'pivot' online as I did not yet have the recognition and networks required to shift from face to face professional development delivery to online.\nIt was demoralising but I\u2019m not alone, many businesses relying on tourism for example have copped a difficult bouncer too. Business recovery strategies will therefore necessarily need to be diverse and targeted, because one size will not fit all. Some might benefit from working through a reinventing process where they\u2019re supported through mentoring or education strategies such as a Deloittes COVID-19 recovery workbook that suggests business owners reflect, restart and revitalise. Some might benefit from re-establishment or revitalisation of traders associations and Chambers of Commerce where the focus is on a whole-of-town or district strategy. Others might benefit from provision of training and retraining opportunities, which might require lobbying providers and state government to provide appropriate courses. Multiple efforts and strategies will be required to recover, reinvent and revitalise adversely impacted businesses.\n What changes and reforms would you like to see in regards to environmental protection?\n There are so many issues around environmental protection that both need to be tackled and can also offer opportunities for farmers, communities, individuals and the beautiful South Gippsland environment. Environmental protection is a delicate balance between carrot and stick approaches. As an educator, I favour the first approach but of course regulations and legislation with \u2018teeth\u2019 are also required. In relation to the carrot approach though, one of the reforms required is to address the short term nature, and very often narrow focus, of funding for environmental projects.\nMany are funded for a year or two but it takes a tree much longer to grow than that and much longer to eradicate weeds and pest animals such as rabbits. Individuals and organisations end up spending hours hunting for funding sources and writing detailed and exacting submissions with no guarantee of a result. Then reporting and aquittal requirements don\u2019t always respond to circumstances - such as COVID lockdowns. A whole of government and systematic review of how projects are identified, supported and funded to recognise the long term nature of environmental protection projects is required, and a dynamic Council can play a role in achieving that.\n What do you think qualifies you to be a local councillor?\n Councils are often associated with rates, roads and rubbish. Education is often said to be the three r\u2019s of reading, (w)riting, and \u2018rithmetic. So as an educator who wants to be elected to Council, I propose I have three qualifications for being a councillor: experience, expertise, and energy.\nIn terms of experience, I have 35+ years experience as a manager, leader, educator and administrator in a wide range of organisations, including a Shire Council as a Social Planner where I started a Youth Council and a Diversity and Inclusion Advisory Group. I\u2019ve been a senior project officer in the , as it was called when I was there and managed a large team in a faculty of education in a large Victorian university.\nIn terms of expertise, I have a PhD in democracy, governance and education that adds extensive and in-depth knowledge to my experiences, that I think is very important for a new Council starting afresh after administrators. I also bring energy and commitment to community as demonstrated by my involvement and leadership in many community service activities. For example I co-founded and still run Corner Inlet Youth Council and co-founded and help run Mayday Projects, a group that works on practical projects and advocacy at levels of government to increase women\u2019s safety.\n In your local community, are there any specific projects you'd like to highlight and advocate for?\n I have two particular projects to highlight and advocate for, among many. The first is opportunities for young people. South Gippsland Shire Council doesn\u2019t have a dedicated youth officer or coordinator and I have joined with others to previously submit that a full time position be created through the latest Council budget consultation process.\nWe were unsuccessful but young people need to be a high priority, always, but never more so given the COVID lockdowns, which is severely restricting their opportunities to develop socially and emotionally and just have the fun that young people should have. As soon as we can, we as a society and community need to make quick opportunities for our young folk to catch up on all the fun they\u2019re missing out on. There are several mental health support and education strategies in place which is important, but so is having a good time.\nA second project is finding a practical model for fixing and kitting out some of the empty properties around small towns and on farms etc. There is a housing affordability and availability emergency in many regional areas, including South Gippsland. SGSC is developing proposals to the State Government\u2019s Big Build initiative and I fully support that. In the meantime as a founding member of Mayday Projects smaller, targeted and tailored projects to the needs of particular people and families and landlords could also make an impact through the cumulative effect of multiple small projects. This could also reduce the environmental impact that large new developments tend to create unless very carefully designed.\n During the COVID-19 lockdown, how have you reached out to local voters?\n I began campaigning just before the latest regional Victoria lockdown. Restrictions were in place so I was busy having lots of coffee catch ups in cafes around Coastal Promontory Ward and indeed around the shire. I was also having a crash course in social media, which is just as well given this current lockdown looks like it might last for much, if not all, of the campaign.\nI have a campaign website and Facebook page and am slowly building up followers, but I do struggle as usually my daughters would help me but they\u2019re in Melbourne and very busy with home schooling, study, etc etc and I don\u2019t want to add more work to their to do lists. I\u2019m increasing the number of local groups I follow on Facebook, which helps me learn what\u2019s happening and what people are talking about.\nI\u2019m running open Zoom meet and greets on Mondays at 12 noon and 8pm. In addition, I\u2019m arranging many Zoom meet and greets with groups of friends, neighbours, interest groups, community groups, organisations, businesses etc. to hear a diverse range of ideas, wish lists and concerns. I have freely provided my phone number to anyone and everyone and a few people are taking the opportunity to call me, as well as contact me via my website and Facebook page.\n Have you ever run for a political office prior to your current candidacy for council?\n I have run for political office twice prior to my current candidacy for Coastal Promontory Ward in the South Gippsland Shire Council elections of 2021. In 2008 I ran for Sandridge Ward of Council elections, and in I ran for the - it\u2019s had a name and boundary change since then. In both of these instances I ran for the , but I resigned from that party in early 2012 because while doing my PhD in democracy, I developed a strong conviction that independent thinking and community voice should drive democracy rather than party loyalties. Thus, I\u2019m now a very dedicated independent, committed to working closely with communities, other councillors, the CEO, other Councils and levels of government in order to respond to, and represent, the people of South Gippsland."}

The Victorian government's COVID-19 response commander Jeroen Weimar confirmed \"this individual travelled to a funeral in Melbourne\", and no other people within the person's household are at risk. \nThe case - which is Latrobe City's first active case since January 12 - is one of 92 community transmission cases recorded on Sunday in Victoria.

I encourage everyone who is eligible for vaccination to make a booking and get the jab, to protect you, your family, and the wider community.\"\nRussell Northe expressed his hope the circumstances would be handled well in regards to the exposure sites.

Administrators were appointed by the Victorian state government in July 2019, who have governed the shire since then. However, South Gippsland's council is scheduled to be restored with an election to be held via post from October 5-22, 2021.\n\"Wikinews\" interviewed one of the candidates standing in this election, Anda Banikos, an independent candidate running in the Coastal-Promontory Ward. The Coastal-Promontory ward covers towns such as , , , , , and , and elects three councillors to the South Gippsland Shire Council.\nInterview.\n What do you hope to achieve as a councillor?\n As a South Gippsland Shire councillor, my priorities will be:\n Do you think the two-year period that South Gippsland Shire has been governed by administrators since its 2019 sacking has been too long, and why/why not?\n Two years is too long, as the administrators are not a democratically elected people's voice. After the elected council was dismissed, it was appropriate to appoint administrators without connections to our Shire. However, in my view, the administrators should have been able to get their job done and new elections organised within a year, not the two years it has taken. During these two years, the administrators have made decisions and implemented plans without transparent community scrutiny or input. I look forward to the new Council working effectively with the community on future plans for our Shire.\n , which takes up the majority of Coastal-Promontory ward's land area, attracts a significant amount of tourists on a yearly basis. With the COVID-19 pandemic and the current lockdown, there has been a large impact on local businesses. What do you think needs to be done to help business recovery?\n Ways our Shire can support small businesses recover are:\n What changes and reforms would you like to see in regards to environmental protection?\n What do you think qualifies you to be a local councillor?\n I have lived in South Gippsland for three decades, moving here with a young family in the 1990s. I currently teach at Fish Creek and have worked in most of the schools in Coastal Promontory Ward over the past 25 years. I have experience with mixed ability education and have been a carer for young people with disabilities.\nMy community involvement has been with an arts and environment focus. As an active member of Coast Arts, I have been involved in organising wide-ranging community arts events such as The Prom Coast Festival, The Fish Creek Tea Cosy Festival, The Great Southern Portrait Prize and the HorseArtsAnzac project. I am also an active member of Landcare and Friends of the Prom. \nMy community involvement and work have all involved respect, goodwill, listening, creative thinking, collaboration and bringing together people of diverse backgrounds and views to produce a mutually worthwhile outcome. I will work with integrity and respect for a better future for all of South Gippsland.\n In your local community, are there any specific projects you'd like to highlight and advocate for?\n During the COVID-19 lockdown, how have you reached out to local voters?\n It has been a challenge to connect with voters during lockdown! Some of the strategies I am using are:\n Have you ever run for a political office prior to your current candidacy for council?\n I have never before run for political office, but am a strong supporter of the democratic process and have worked for the AEC and VEC as an electoral officer. I have no political affiliations or vested business interests in our Shire. I decided to run for Council because I care about our community and environment and can see unavoidable changes and threats posed by climate change. I can also see the opportunities offered by new technologies and creative communities to make South Gippsland more resilient and productive."}

Cousin is endorsed by the , and is contesting the Tarwin Valley ward, which elects three councillors to the South Gippsland Shire Council, and includes the towns of and .\nInterview.\n What do you hope to achieve as a councillor?\n I care about South Gippsland and local democracy and want to see our community, economy and environment thrive and be far more resilient. South Gippsland deserves a Council that listens and engages the community and is wise in using and developing the community's resources. It deserves councilors who work together for the whole community's benefit. So, I'm making a commitment to Tarwin Valley and South Gippsland if I'm elected to work hard to:\n1. Restore community confidence in local government, focusing on openness, participation, and ethical behaviour. \n2. Increase community involvement in Council's policies, plans and strategies to deal with climate change and public health, economic and environmental challenges.\n3. Find better ways of managing Council's business to improve rate fairness and standards accountability and service.\n4. Provide leadership and advocacy to improve our country, economy, and community wellbeing.\n Do you think the two-year period that South Gippsland Shire has been governed by administrators since its 2019 sacking has been too long, and why/why not?\n The Administrators virtually closed-off public participation and engagement in Council decision making. Councillors play an important role in listening to residents and ratepayers, bringing their concerns to Council and the CEO for resolution. Three Melbourne-based Commissioners just can\u2019t perform the roles and duties of 9 elected councillors. The Administrators have made long term decisions on many things, including tourism and economic development plans and the Council Plan that really should have been formulated with community direction and widespread collaboration and participation. Many who made submissions on these plans didn\u2019t get a response to their issues. Other important Council plans need urgent refresh including the Health and Wellbeing Plan which is now out of date. Priority should be given to refreshing these plans to help our community towards a better future.\n Since 1993, South Gippsland has not had a passenger railway service, when the service to Leongatha was closed. Do you think that these services should be brought back, and why/why not?\n It's difficult to reinstate V/Line rail services now the railway corridor has been converted into the . The Leongatha to section is increasingly popular for locals tourists; and the to Leongatha section is now being constructed. One of my wish projects is to ensure this trail is continuous and passes safely through Leongatha.\nIn the last Council, Andrew McEwan was Council's nominee on the Regional Transport Forum, which collated residents\u2019 public transport needs. Our community is very supportive of improved public transport within the Shire's townships, between the Shire's and other regional centres - especially the Latrobe Valley where a lot of people work. Some said the services to and from Melbourne were ok. What people mostly asked for was better timetabling and more stop off and pick up points on all routes with the possibility of feeder mini-buses linking in to key drop off points were needed to provide finer grain transport services. The itself is generating further demand for public transport to return walkers and riders back-to-their starting points.\n What changes and reforms would you like to see in regards to environmental protection?\n The Local Government Act requires Council to promote action on climate change. Council has already started this. Faced with more frequent natural events and disasters we need to fast-track a community-based response to climate change and biodiversity loss. Initiatives to improve community resilience will help manage the impacts on Council roads and services and reduce business and resident disruptions to energy, water and transport networks. \nCouncil already does some fine collaborative work in natural disaster preparedness, and this should continue, engaging farmers, and community organisations as well to increase resilience and improve our disaster preparedness.\nNature's beauty is a cornerstone of South Gippsland's tourism - our native forests, rolling hills and coastlines. Look closer you'll see landscapes on both public and private land that need regeneration and native flora and fauna need protection. Council can play a role in this, principally through collaboration and advocacy. Agencies working together, joining the dots, can achieve a lot more than working alone. For example, to better fulfil obligations under the Catchment and Land Protection Act and Planning Scheme I'd like to see Council improve the way it works with landcare groups, the CMA and other water authorities. \nWe need to take a shire-wide look at ways to improve roads and roadside safety rather than the piecemeal approach to works that creates more problems than they solve. Through regional collaboration with government agencies and the private sector Council can set out a Transport Plan for heavy vehicles and other traffic, road and intersection upgrades and public transport. Again, collaboration and advocacy are the key.\n What do you think qualifies you to be a local councillor?\n I have a mix of skills and experience which give me a great grounding to be a local councillor. I'm qualified in urban and regional planning and I've worked in local government across three states. My approach to planning focuses on problem solving, advocacy and community engagement. My knowledge of Victoria's planning system means I can respond capably to planning matters that come to Council for a decision. My strategic skills mean I can take a holistic, fact-based approach to the issues that come before Council.\nI have a degree in public administration, and experience at senior levels in Victorian and Commonwealth governments, so I know how governments work, the separation of powers and the laws that govern Council. With this knowledge comes a close adherence to ethical behaviour.\nI grew up on a dairy farm in Gippsland and have strong connections to many of the Shire's food producers and farmers. More recently I've focused on natural resource management, water governance, regenerative agriculture, and biodiversity conservation, so I know the whole of the Shire quite well, and some of the nuts and bolts of South Gippsland's economy.\n In your local community, are there any specific projects you'd like to highlight and advocate for?\n For the last four years, I've been volunteering with the Mirboo North district community to help preserve our native forests. A beautiful citizen-science report will soon been released on the rich biodiversity of the Mirboo North State Forest, which plays a big role in community wellbeing and water supply, attracts many visitors which many of the businesses in the Tarwin Valley rely on.\nI'd like to see rail trails, continuous and promoted as a unique tourism experience which invites visitors and residents alike to experience the fine foods grown and produced here, visit our towns and natural areas and take advantage of the array of bed and breakfast and health retreats and cultural events.\n During the COVID-19 lockdown, how have you reached out to local voters?\n Early last year, I coordinated Mirboo North and district's fantastic community response to the bushfires to help East Gippsland's remote communities. As a food producer I keep in contact with a lot of small traders and customers across the Shire and region. I love talking with people at farmers markets. During the lockdowns, I'm taking to social media to reach out. I've kept up with people engaged in regenerative agriculture and climate change via zoom and the occasional meeting during breaks in lockdown. But now that we can move around more freely, I'm to getting back to driving to each local area in the ward and having great face to face discussions. We all need social contact.\n Why did you choose to run as a Greens candidate for local council?\n In 2016, I became very concerned about the overuse of toxic chemicals in Council's day-to-day operations and was unhappy with the dismissive way my concerns were treated by Council. I felt Council could make some basic changes to improve customer and community responsiveness, so I threw my hat in the ring for the 2016 election as an independent candidate for South Gippsland Council. I had a good community response, but not enough to take a seat on Council at that time.\nAs a farmer and food producer who cares for the environment, I found most political parties were very slow to act, or worse, denying the existence of the huge issues I saw threatening our wellbeing and existence, which left me deeply unsatisfied. I joined the Greens because I found they have many values that I agree with and positive proposals to deal with the big issues I'm concerned about; and they and are open to new ideas and continuous learning, all of which appealed to me. I see myself now as a Country Green, grounded in agriculture, our environment, and the South Gippsland community. I'm ready to listen, to learn, and to focus on practical action to make a positive difference to our community and planet.\nAfter joining the Greens, in October 2018 I was elected by countback to Council after a sitting Councillor resigned. I did the right thing and openly declared my political affiliation. While people generally believe that local government is not party political, in my experience most councillors don't openly declare their political affiliations even though they have one. The laws governing being a councillor are clear about declaring personal interests and conflicts of interest. This transparency and honesty to the public is vital, and in my view extends to party political affiliations too."}

Governor-General Sir issued a proclamation in 1997 to urge all Australians to observe one minutes' silence.\nThe website states 61,630 Australians perished during the First World War between August 4, 1914 and March 31, 1921, making the conflict the deadliest in Australian history by far. The RSL website states that from the country's population of five million, 416,809 enlisted, 155 thousand were wounded and eight thousand died of post-war injuries.\nQuestions were fielded by RSL Ambassador Pete Rudland, who served with the from 1989 to 2017 and had deployments in Cambodia in 1993, Iraq in 1997 and again in 2003, East Timor in 2001 and Afghanistan in 2010, when he was injured in a fatal helicopter crash that killed four.\nInterview with Pete Rudland.\n How has Remembrance Day changed in RSL's history of commemoration?\nLet that sink in, over 60,000 Australians that would be buried in foreign lands. \nAustralia, other countries and would not be able to effectively mourn their losses.\nFor Australians, the Returned &amp; Services League (RSL) provided an opportunity for the families of the fallen and wounded to mourn together and heal through shared experiences. Soldiers from all backgrounds stood together to remember and understand everyone\u2019s experience of War. \nToday\u2019s wars do not exact the same toll, however for those that fight them and their families the RSL continues to provide the same opportunities as it did a hundred years ago. \nRemembrance Day in its size of impacted people has changed but the narrative will never change. \n What is the role you believe organisations should take in Remembrance Day?\n What is the role you believe governments should take in Remembrance Day?\nWith that being said, Governments need to take the lead on Remembrance Day and . Soldiers don\u2019t make decisions to go to war, governments do! [sic] and for that to continue soldiers must feel that their sacrifices are respected by the people that make the decision to deploy them. The act of recognising significant days like ANZAC Day and Remembrance Day reinforces the relationship between government, soldiers and the country.\n 103 years after the 1918 Armistice, why is Remembrance Day important today? Has it retained its poignancy so long after the War?\n had only just been granted and most Australians would have been very proud of what our very young nation had achieved domestically and militarily during this period. \nAustralia, as part of the Commonwealth, along with its allies defeated the in the largest war the world had ever seen. \nI think that Australians learnt the enormous price of war and honoured it. Soldiers and their families\u2019 sacrifices shaped the direction of our nation and I think that most people today understand the relationship between the past and present. That is why it has retained its poignancy for over one hundred years.\n What do the lessons of World War I and its aftermath teach us of veterans' affairs today?\n Why should Remembrance Day be commemorated alongside 25 April - ANZAC Day?\nRemembrance Day reminds Australians of more than the heavy human price of WW1. It reminds us of the holistic burden of a new nation trying to find its place. A nation that despite this pulled together to support our , our Country, our , our families and friends and our neighbours.\nANZAC Day and Remembrance Day together on the Australian calendar symbolises the path all Australians have walked.

The government hopes to undercut inflation and help the economy with this move, but does not indemnify petrol stations for their losses. A is scheduled for April 3, for which all opposition parties currently in but one have to beat the ruling , which is now in its twelfth year in tenure.\nOrb\u00e1n announced the extension in his annual speech, claiming The official gazette, , published the corresponding government resolution No. 39/2022 a day later. A week earlier, deputy finance minister said to news agency that tax authority checks on over 2000 fuel stations had found no recurring price cap violations but 12 violators were fined a total of 3.2 million (USD10140). , T\u00e1llai added.\nOrb\u00e1n said Price-aggregator site \"holtankoljak.hu\" put uncapped prices to HUF512 for gasoline, and HUF530 for diesel, and reported that wholesale prices have exceeded consumer prices since February 4. Based on the price aggregator's data, \"Napi.hu\" reported three stations had closed permanently in the first week of February because of the price cap. By law, the government can appoint new operators for closed stations.\nOn November 10 the government had decided to introduce the HUF480 (USD1.52) price cap, and then briefed the press about it the next day. The official gazette published the related act, government resolution No. 624/2021, on the day of the announcement. The follow-up resolution No. 626/2021, published on November 13, detailed the procedure. The cap applies to and standard diesel, and does not cover (LPG) or premium fuels, but stations have to sell premium fuels at this price, if they do not sell standard ones.\nIn effect, the losses are incurred by petrol stations as they cannot negotiate wholesale prices. During the November 11 press briefing, Minister of the Prime Minister's Office said they do not plan to compensate for these losses, but added . The following day, the Hungarian Petroleum Association's secretary general Ott\u00f3 Gr\u00e1d told that owners of small, independent stations may think about closing. In contrast to the press briefing, the detailed resolution dictates that petrol stations cannot close temporarily or shorten their opening hours.\nThe government does not plan to reduce on fuel. The oil bulletin of the European Commission showed last week that out of the total consumer price in Hungary, 47% is tax for unleaded 95, and 45% is tax for standard diesel.\nCumulative data for 2021 by the Hungarian Petroleum Association shows that volume-wise unleaded 95 makes up for 79% of all gasoline, and standard diesel makes up for 88% of all diesel sales in the country. Between 2020 and 2021, year-on-year consumer prices for November 8 went up from HUF332 to 506 for unleaded 95, and from HUF341 to 517 for standard diesel, according to price-comparison site \"holtankoljak.hu\". 444.hu reported that the worsening HUF-USD exchange rates caused prices to climb even in July, when crude oil prices were dropping.\nThe reported inflation hit 7.9% in January.

The launch date was delayed by a week due to unfavorable weather.\nThe United States National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) began project development in 1996, planning for a launch in 2007 at a cost of USD550 million. After NASA contracted Northrop Grumman to build the telescope, mission managers estimated a 2010 launch would cost between one and 3.5 billion USD. Redesigns to reduce technical requirements pushed launch plans to 2013 for an estimated cost of USD4.5 billion. The US Congress ordered a project review in 2010 which delayed the launch again to 2015.\nFor an estimated cost of USD6.5 billion, the proposed canceling the telescope altogether in 2011.

In 2017, over half of such products were found by the (OLAF) to be imported below \"the lowest acceptable prices\".\nThe lowest acceptable prices are a risk assessment tool introduced by OLAF to detect \"imports presenting a significant risk of undervaluation\".

The Commission estimates this cost the EU budget \u20ac2.68 billion (~$2.9 billion) from 2011-17, as 80% of customs duties go toward funding the EU's budget.\nHowever, the ECJ denied the Commission's request the UK provide such a sum as repayment, citing inconsistencies with its full amount calculations which meant it had not met the \"requisite legal standard\". The UK remains under ECJ jurisdiction for infractions made during its EU membership even after leaving the EU in January 2020. The UK was ordered to pay four-fifths of legal costs Brussels incurred since OLAF first alleged misconduct in 2017.\nThe UK can challenge the fine, but not the result from the judgment. The fine amount \u20ac2.68 billion is up from the original \u20ac1.99 billion in lost duties uncovered from a sophisticated fraud ring.

It added the \"inadequate nature of the checks carried out by the United Kingdom customs authorities\" allowed fraudulent shell companies to move their operations to the UK. \nThe ECJ concluded the UK had also failed \"to provide the Commission with all the information necessary\" to make its own calculations.\nThe UK remained opposed to the EU's methods against calculating undervalued goods, and was supported in doing so by Belgium, Estonia, Greece, Latvia, Portugal and Slovakia. Of them, Portugal, Slovakia and the UK, as well as Malta and Spain, were found to have \"major undervaluation hubs\" in the first month of OLAF's 2014 Operation Snake.\nBritish ports, specifically Dover, were found to be the main entry points for Chinese goods before clearing European customs and being trafficked across the continent.

Turning off the taps would put energy security, British jobs and industries at risk and we would be even more dependent on foreign imports.\"\nThe European Commission was more cautious, planning to cut Union dependence on Russian imports by two-thirds this year, before ceasing altogether \"well before 2030\". But whereas Russia supplies 40% of the EU's natural gas, much of the UK's energy is produced domestically.\nThe spokesperson contrasted the British situation with that of the EU: \"Our single largest source of gas is from the and the vast majority of imports come from reliable suppliers such as Norway.\n\"There are no gas pipelines directly linking the UK with Russia.

The spokesperson said: \"We continue to monitor the impacts that Putin\u2019s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine is having on the cost of living in the UK, so we keep our approach under review.\"\nThe release asserted Russian oil \"is already being ostracised by the market\". And in any case: \"In a competitive global market for oil and petroleum products, demand can be met by alternative suppliers. We will work closely with international partners to ensure alternative supplies of fuel products.\"\nBut high inflation, already associated with the rising cost of petrol, has seen prices rise in all key areas. Before the Russian invasion, the Bank of England forecast inflation to rise to about 7% in spring, from 5.4% last year.

The (IFS) has said the \u00a39 billion package by Chancellor of the Exchequer \"would now offset only about one fifth of the rise in household energy bills.\"\nThe government spokesperson said: \"We recognise the concerns people have about the cost of living, which is why we have set out a generous package of support worth around 21bn including a \u00a3150 rebate from April and a further \u00a3200 energy bill discount in October - cutting energy bills quickly for the majority of households.\"\nThey added: \"We are already providing support to families worth around \u00a320 [billion] this financial year and next, including cutting the taper to make sure work pays, freezing alcohol and fuel duties to keep costs down, and providing \u00a39.1bn to support 27 million households with their energy bills.\"\nAs hinted, all measures were introduced prior to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, which began on February 24.\nOn February 3, it was announced those in England in Council Tax bands A-D would get \u00a3150 off their council tax payments. It was also announced there would be a \u00a3200 discount on all Britons' energy bills in autumn.

He added he plans to set \"out an energy independence plan for this country in the course of the next few days to ensure that we undo some of the damage of previous decisions taken\".\nSunak announced changes to Universal Credit and the continued freeze of fuel levies during his autumn budget statement on October 27. The amount withheld workers making above the worker allowance threshold per pound was reduced from 63 pence to 55 pence. It follows the UK government's cancellation of a Covid-19 uplift of \u00a320 per week to Universal Credit in early October, which cut the income of six million claimants by \u00a31040 per annum.\nThe fuel duty was frozen twelve years ago and has not been lifted since.

To minimise the effect this will have on British consumers, Sir Keir pushed for nuclear power, renewable energy and home insulation at PMQs.\nJohnson defended his record on renewables, calling the UK \"the Saudi Arabia of wind power\". The UK spokesperson told \"Wikinews\" \"It\u2019s the right thing to do to move away from dependence on Russian oil and gas across Europe and this means looking at more nuclear and much more use of renewable energy.\"\nHowever: \"Companies and skilled employees right across the UK\u2019s gas sector are working to maximise production through this winter, helped by several small new wells and fields that have come online in recent months and edged production up.\" The example Wikinews raised over the Abigail oil field in the North Sea, which was greenlit for development by an Israeli firm on February 2, was not addressed. At the time, the director of the told Sky News oil and gas will remain a source of British energy for decades.\nThe government spokesperson continued: \"The issues we are facing are a result of high international gas prices rather than supply, and further UK oil and gas licensing is unlikely to have a major impact in the short term.\"\nThe Labour Party has urged a to be imposed on excess profits made by major fossil fuel companies, including BP and . Both companies reported historic profits for 2021 in February. BP saw profits of $12.8 billion from -$5.7 billion in 2020, and Shell $19.3 billion from $4.85 billion in 2020.\nAfter BP's announcement, Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer tweeted \"The chancellor\u2019s energy plans last week left families more worried than ever. It\u2019s time for Labour\u2019s plan for a one-off windfall tax on oil and gas producers to cut bills.\" However, when pressed at PMQs, Johnson urged a \"a sober, responsible approach.\". He said: \"The net result of [a windfall tax] would be to see the oil companies put their prices up yet higher, and make it more difficult for them to [divest] from dependence on Russian oil and gas.\"\nThe UK government spokesperson told \"Wikinews\": \"A windfall tax could deter \u00a314 billion worth of opportunities awaiting investment, which would risk both security of our energy supply, as well as almost 200,000 jobs that rely on the industry.\n\"Oil and gas companies in the North Sea are already subject to a tax rate on their profits that is more than double those paid by other businesses. To date, the sector has contributed more than \u00a3375 billion in production taxes.\n\"We keep all taxes under review but we do not comment on speculation about tax changes.\n\"The UK Government places additional taxes on the extraction of oil and gas, with companies engaged in the production of oil and gas on the UK Continental Shelf subject to headline tax rates on their profits that are currently more than double those paid by other businesses. To date, the sector has paid more than \u00a3375 billion in production taxes.\"\nThe government is also criticised for its plan to retrofit homes with poor insulation. In March last year, the government's flagship green homes grant was scrapped, having only installed 5800 energy efficiency measures.\nThe government spokesperson responded: \"We are investing almost \u00a36.6 billion to support the installation of energy efficiency measures in low energy performance homes including older properties with low income home owners and tenants.\n\"The Heat and Buildings Strategy set out a comprehensive package of measures we are taking to kickstart the transition to low-carbon heat and build the market for heat pumps.

LJI President and CEO said: \"Finding antibodies with this breadth is important because we don't know which virus in the genus of ebolaviruses is going to break out next.\"\nOf the six ebolaviruses known to science, the Zaire and Sudan ebolaviruses are the two most deadly: the that killed eleven thousand was caused by the Zaire virus.\nThe new contribution made in this paper is that scientists used the imaging technique to observe how and where the antibodies interact with the viruses.\nThe team saw that 1C3, instead of binding to the target site on the viral in the typical molecular -and- fashion, stuck itself sideways across the glycoprotein, blocking three binding sites at once. Antibodies work by binding to s and neutralizing their s.\n1C11 works by interfering with the molecules that the virus would use to enter a cell. Because the Zaire and Sudan ebolaviruses use very similar mechanisms, 1C11 is effective against both.\nAccording to the research team, the primary advantage that these two antibodies have over others is that they are resistant to . When some viruses enter the body, including the Zaire and Sudan ebolaviruses, they produce excess glycoprotein and release it into the area like a smokescreen. This causes many of the body's antibodies bind to this glycoprotein instead, as many as 90 percent of them. 1C3 and 1C11 do not; they bind only to the real virus.\nThis means that antibody treatments based on 1C3 and 1C11 are likely to be effective at much lower doses than other treatments, as early experiments have already shown: One treatment has already been tested in non-human primates, and even the lowest doses used were 100 percent effective. This also means the human treatment might be much cheaper to produce than expected.\nAccording to LJI, treatment based on these two antibodies would offer two advantages over existing treatments. First, patients with undiagnosed species of \"Ebolavirus\" can be treated with an antibody cocktail that is effective against more than one virus. Because doctors don't always have time to figure out which virus a patient has, this could save many lives. Second, these antibodies would be effective in patients with later stages of the disease.\nThe experiments were conducted using samples donated to by two Ebola survivors."}

Local and candidates gave apologies in place of attendance.\nThe event was preceded by a climate action rally outside the Ballarat Civics Hall and the Ballarat Town Hall, which featured speeches from both representatives of BREAZE, the Ballarat branch of , Environment Victoria, the , and the Ballarat Trades Hall.\nThe forum began with each candidate being given three minutes to summarise their policies on climate before questions were taken from members of the public. John Barnes, the Greens candidate, began by claiming \"the Greens have the most ambitious program of any of the parties on addressing climate change\", and said if the Greens were in the in the coming election, they would work to push Labor towards the \"reforming zeal of past generations\", invoking former Labor Prime Minister . Barnes stated the Greens have a target of 75% emissions reduction by 2030, by which time they would also end the mining, burning, and export of coal in Australia. \nIndependent candidate Alex Graham began his speech by saying he was \"passionate about our environment\" and claimed to have \"absolutely, without question, the best policy\", explaining the focus of his candidacy was to introduce a referendum that would allow the Australian government to \"write its own money supply into existence\". Graham said this policy would deliver \"money beyond the pale to totally restore our environment\".\nIncumbent MP Catherine King said that in her twenty years as an MP, the Australian Parliament had been unable to deal with the climate issue. She referenced previous attempts by the last Labor government to legislate policies to tackle climate change, such as the (CPRS), but stated these efforts were \"completely and utterly dismantled\" after the . \nKing referred to the Powering Australia policy announced in December 2021 by Labor energy and climate spokesperson , stating the policy had been supported by the (BCA), (NFF) and \"some\" environmental groups. King stated the policy included a commitment to 43% emissions reduction by 2030, net zero carbon emissions by 2050, and it would overall \"grow jobs, increase renewable energy, and bring emissions down\". \nKerryn Sedgman of the Australian Federation Party promised to centre the opinions of views of the community, and read from the Federation policy on climate directly, saying \"carbon is not the enemy. Toxic pesticides are the true enemy.\" Sedgman claimed pesticides were the primary source of nitrous oxide (N\u2082O) released, and that N\u2082O was \"300 times worse than carbon\".\nAfter the candidates concluded with their opening summaries, members of the public were open to ask questions. The first question asked candidates what their first two priorities were for climate action. Barnes said the Greens' top priority was \"prompt action\", and they would also focus on transforming the nation's economy to \"a new way \u2014 a new sustainable way \u2014 of making our living in the world\". Graham stated if Australia had a limitless supply of money, there would not be a climate change issue and Australia would become a model for the world. He said his two priorities would be creating more money and introducing newer technologies.\nKing said her first priority would be getting more renewables into the grid and generally increasing the amount of renewables, and also added a third priority, saying that as in a Labor government, she would add a climate section to the department and work to create a network of electric vehicle charging stations. Sedgman stated \"there's more than two top priorities\", but remarked that soil regeneration was a key part of carbon sequestration, and called for a more immediate approach to deal with climate through education and community hubs.\nThe event was then disturbed slightly by a person asking about a supposed \"ninety-year suppression order suppressing the names of twenty-eight VIP alleged paedophiles\", who was asked to leave by organisers for disrupting the event. King labeled the belief a \" conspiracy theory\".\nAfter this, the topic shifted to the proposed Western Victorian Transmission Network, a proposed overhead transmission line from Bulgana to Sydenham. Graham said his proposed referendum, if successful, could lead to the federal government subsidising a plan to put the transmission line underground beneath the , emphasising we shouldn't \"let money interfere with saving this planet\". King noted the location of a proposed transfer station was \"really problematic\", but stated the issue lay more with the regulatory process, and Labor would work with state and territory governments to reform this process.\nSedgman admitted she was not fully aware of some of the background King had bought up, and she would like to speak to those affected personally. Barnes said the consultation of , who propose building the transmission line, had not been good, and hopes an extended time granted for the environmental impact statement will allow all people affected to be properly heard. Barnes also stated AusNet had claimed diverting the line underground would cost thirteen times more than the overhead alternative, while a study showed it would only cost five times more.\nOne questioner asked about what the candidates would do to investigate the possibility of . Barnes remarked \"the best way to sequester carbon is not to release it in the first place\", and said the mechanical removal of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere was \"probably a pipe dream\". Graham quipped he was \"prepared to ask my friend if he could do it, and I'm sure he could.\" King argued the technology was \"a fair way off yet\", but noted 3 billion was reserved in Labor's Powering Australia plan for new technologies to reduce emissions. Sedgman stressed the importance of reducing the \"extraordinary rate\" at which deforestation occurs.\nCandidates were then asked if they would commit to no new coal and gas infrastructure. King confirmed a moratorium on new coal and gas was not part of Labor policy, but they were not interested in investing taxpayer funds towards them, contrasting it with what she said was the current government's approach to projects such as the . Graham said, as someone who had previously worked in the industry, he would \"close down every coal-fired power station as soon as it was possible\" and disallow the construction of new coal-fired power stations. Graham also pledged to close down coal mines and ban .\nBarnes stated the Greens take the advice of the seriously, and would not allow any new coal, gas, or oil projects, as well as closing down coal-fired power stations by 2030, to be replaced by renewable energy. Barnes emphasised the need to lower emissions before 1.5 \u00b0C of global warming was reached.\nOne questioner asked candidates what they would do in the event of two scenarios after the coming election \u2014 one being that Labor had a clear majority, the other that the Greens held the balance of power. King stated the \"beauty of power in Australia\" was it didn't require any legislation. However, she said Labor would still attempt to legislate targets of 43% emissions reduction and net zero carbon emissions by 2050. Barnes reiterated the Greens in the balance of power would push Labor to be more ambitious, and that while compromise would be needed in a hung parliament, the Greens would \"play hardball\" on addressing the climate.\nCandidates were then asked about a proposal from to turn northern Australia into the \"battery of Asia\". Barnes stated Australia could become a \"energy superpower\", and good government policy could have the market \"with us\" on this issue. King declared over 600,000 jobs could be realised under Labor's Powering Australia plan, and concurred in saying Australia should be a renewable energy superpower and exporting technology to the world. She highlighted the need for a government that \"believes in climate change, believes that we have to do something about it\", and restated that Labor's plan was endorsed by the BCA and NFF.\nThe final question asked how those in coal communities such as the could be helped to deal with the potential loss of jobs with a transition to renewable energy. Graham responded by calling for a \"basic, living universal wage to all people\", while Sedgman asked who was eligible to have these jobs in the first place \"due to the current mandate conditions\". King said the demand for fossil fuels was running out, with trading partners setting targets of net zero emissions by 2050. She underlined the \"really good jobs in renewables\", and emphasised the need to start now in training people for new, good-paying renewable jobs, as otherwise these workers wouldn't get jobs again. \nBarnes stated the Greens had announced A$19 billion over ten years with the aim of transitioning communities affected by a move away from fossil fuels, they would aim for renewables running the power system by 2030, and they would run retraining programs and maintain existing incomes for \"up to a decade\" if workers cannot find \"equally lucrative\" jobs. Barnes emphasised the need to not vilify those working in mining communities, and a plan must be in place for these communities to maintain their dignity.\nThe forum concluded with representatives from Environment Victoria in the local area invited to present copies of an open letter calling for \"faster and fairer climate action\", and which was signed by 125 people. Among other things, the letter called for a replacement of \"coal, oil and gas with clean energy\", \"a national plan to slash climate pollution this decade with strong targets that, at a minimum, match our trading partners\", and an accelerated rollout of renewable energy projects with the aim of creating \"a healthy, prosperous economy while ceasing new energy generating projects from fossil fuel sources\"."}

Protesters demanded that the government keep abortion legal and accessible. Earlier this month, ' published a leaked draft of a US Supreme Court decision showing that a majority of justices on the nine-judge panel were planning to overturn the 1973 ' decision that rendered the procedure legal throughout the US. Protests took place in Atlanta, Chicago, New York and other cities. There were an estimated 20,000 marchers in Washington D.C. alone.\n\"It's only the most important issue there is right now because if the leaked opinion becomes the final opinion,\" said Ann Hoffman, who attended the protest in Washington D.C., \"it could affect all kinds of rights \u2014 not just the right of choice but the right to health care.\" Hoffman, 79, claimed to have been advocating for women's rights since the 1970s.\nA few dozen anti-abortion-rights counter-protesters also came to Washington D.C. that day. One, 24-year-old Anna Lulis of Virginia, held a sign reading \"women's rights begin in the womb.\" Police kept the two groups from approaching each other, but there were some clashes.\nIf Roe v. Wade is overturned, the legality of abortion will revert to individual states. The predicts that 26 of the nation's 50 states are \"certain or likely\" to ban abortion. Many states have already passed \"trigger laws\": abortion bans that will go into effect automatically if Roe v Wade is overturned.\nThe leaked draft opinion covers \"\", which appeared before the Court last December. The state of Mississippi had passed a law forbidding almost all abortions after 15 weeks. This was based on the idea that a 15-week old fetus may be capable of surviving outside the woman's uterus, such as in an incubator. The common understanding is that a fetus cannot do this until 24 weeks. Through its agent Thomas Dobbs, Mississippi asked the Supreme Court to overturn its 1973 decision that women have a constitutional right to abortion. Jackson Women's Health Organization, the only abortion clinic remaining in the state, argues that there is no reason for the Court to do this.\nEarlier this week, members of the US Senate attempted to pass a federal law declaring abortion legal throughout the country, which would have overruled any state laws, but it failed to get enough votes to pass. The efforts stalled on Wednesday.\nDespite Roe, many states within the US had passed laws limiting abortions or making them more difficult to get, for example by mandating waiting periods that necessitate that the patient take an extra day away from work. More recently, the state of Texas had passed a law limiting abortion to the first six weeks after the last menstrual period. At that time, many women do not yet know they are pregnant.\nUnited States President Joe Biden has advised the American people to vote for pro-abortion-rights candidates in the upcoming 2022 midterm elections."}

The seagrass greatly surpasses the 43-hectare stand of quaking Aspen trees in Utah, United States, previously thought to be the world's largest plant. The seagrass grows a maximum of 35 centimetres per year, with its large size helping scientists calculate its age.\nDr. Elizabeth Sinclair, another co-author of the study, said the plant's survival was helped by it holding onto all the chromosomes from both its parents. This gave it genetic diversity, which is unusual among plants that produce asexually. The plant does not sexually reproduce; however, subtle variations in its DNA may help explain its longevity.\nAssociate Professor Kathryn McMahon, of Edith Cowan University, was not involved in the study but is an expert on seagrass. She said seagrass tends to live for between 2,000 and 100,000 years, meaning the plant's age of about 4,500 years fits into the normal age range of seagrass. McMahon also said she was confident in the method used by the researchers, and that the finding it was a single plant was \"amazing\".\nDespite the plant's vast size, in the past ten years, almost a tenth of it has been destroyed by cyclones and rising ocean temperatures, which \"NBC News\" noted had been attributed to climate change.
