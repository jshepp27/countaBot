This money once spent will require producers to produce more meaning they need to hire more people which will give those people more money to spend creating a virtuous circle of economic growth.Once recession is over and growth is good the theory then says that the government should raise revenue out of the booming economy by taxing the producers the saving class and the wealthy so as to pay down the debt that it acquired in the previous step.From that I conclude that Keynesianism is always either for the working class the spending class and the generally poor andor against the capitalist the saving class and the generally rich. The activities of the former group are economically good and should be encouraged the activities of the latter group are economically bad albeit necessary and should be discouraged minimized to only whats absolutely needed to support the activities of the former group.At this point I see five possibilities.

And in any rural town like the one Im from dowsing is still used by some to find water and it costs a lot of money.Also I wont forget to mention the media astrology has a place on every newspaper and it also sells a lot of books promoted on tv ads.The simple practical argument to make is that this is a fraud in any kind of legal system they are deceiving people to purchase something that has no guarantee to actually work as expected.And we shouldnt forget that there are many desperate people that spend what could be almost all of their money on these things trying to find a way out of a difficult situation only to come out with more frustration and less money.So there is a select few sanctioned by the media making lots of profit off credulous people while the government turns a blind eye on the whole thing.This is a horrible crime especially when a persons health is at risk.Now Ive heard many counter arguments to mine but they all basically rely on the Placebo effect stating that since most of them dont have obvious negative effects they can always at least give some kind of psychological comfort for the effort.But thats not good enough when it can be so expensive and someone needs it for their wellbeing! and sometimes parents end up putting their children through this awful experiences Ive seen it happen to kids with serious diseases taken to faith healers.I know this is a world wide issue but most people dont even consider it an issue there is a flawed social concept saying that if so many people believe it then it must be true and that alone will keep all of these thing alive forever.So the state has to step up to defend the innocent people in the middle of this.I havent met many people or anyone here that thinks the same way I do so I would love to hear your thoughts on this and see if anyone can convince me that this whole thing is not as terrible as I think it is or if maybe there is another solution.',\n  'label': 'homeopathy'},\n 't3_3pe78y': {'argument': 'Before I begin I would like to stress that I am a very large fan of American football especially in its collegiate form.

It would be better to break it down further so that they are taxed on the first k on the next k and on the next k. Tax rate should be increased bit by bit as someones salary increases rather than having big jumps in tax rate. With a single formula there are no jumps and this leads to a fairer tax system.Heres a graph of a function which I came up with the very rich pay tax on their salary and those earning pay tax. Of course no one earns but this could easily be adjusted so that minimum wage earners pay and those slightly above minimum pay very little.One of Adam Smiths canons of taxation is that the tax system should be simple or understandable by the public.

But nevertheless I think theyre being dishonest even if that means theyre also lying to themselves.If I understand the forced birth position properly the essence of the argument goes something like thisThe problem here is that we know with absolute certainty how to dramatically lower the abortion rate almost overnight free or extremely low cost but free produces better results contraception for young women and teens. This is proven in many real world implementations to reduce the abortion rate by upwards of in the first year and more as time passes.But the forced birthers arent supporting programs like that. In fact in Colorado where such a program existed funded for the first few years by private funds which ran out the forced birth faction actively campaigned AGAINST continuing the program with tax dollars.When I ask forced birth advocates about this they almost inevitably reply either that they dont believe their tax dollars should subsidize someone elses sex life or that they believe it is immoral to have sex outside marriage and that its certainly immoral for teenagers to have sex.The problem here and the reason why this leads me to think they dont really believe abortion is murder is that this means theyre prioritizing their own taxeconomic beliefs above saving babies or that theyre prioritizing their discomfort with people having sex in ways they dont like above saving babies.It isnt just that they have to prioritize its that they have prioritized. Perhaps not in a deliberate step by step conscious process but they have at least subconsciously prioritized their own tax or moral beliefs above killing babies.Im forced to conclude that either theyre monsters who but a monster would argue that their tax policy is worth murdering babies or that theyre not being honest about their belief that abortion is murder.If as they argue abortion is murder and that therefore it is worth sacrificing womens bodily autonomy to prevent it then surely it follows that if abortion is murder its worth them sacrificing a few tax dollars or a bit of squik on their part.',\n  'label': []},\n 't3_2e6v25': {'argument': 'Reference Article I dont buy into the idea that the president should never play golf or relax in any way.

It makes absolutely zero sense to have teachers who cannot pass a literacy test at a th grade level teaching students who could very well be more literate than them.

Since sex on the first date shows that a woman considers a mans genes to be good genes good enough to risk being a single mother evolutionarily it means that he is at least attractive enough to cheat on a partner with since unless she is concerned with violence from the partner the risk from cheating is being a single mother.

Simpson'},\n {'id': 't3_664k31',\n  'argument': 'Historically human population growth went along with increases in food production and the switch from subsistence farming to larger scale farming and eventually industrial farming. These increases in food production were made possible by a string of innovations and increases in productivity through technological and methodological advances in farming like crop rotation better plowing tools use of animal labour use of manure as fertilizer breeding of crops and livestock chemically produced fertilizers and pesticides and as of late genetic modification of crops.Today is the first time in recorded history that we deliberately use farming methods that decrease output under the moniker of organic food production. I believe that the desire for organic food production is a symptom of rich and saturated societies and is what we here know as a first world problem. This desire has the potential to compromise the global food output if it becomes more widespread and increase the number of people living in hunger and dying from starvation.I dont contest that chemically produced fertilizers and pesticides and GMO crops must be used carefully and in measured amounts to get the riskbenefit balance right and yes there are risks hazards and dangers associated with them. I dont contest either that early pesticides were rather poisonous and at times did more harm than good especially when used naively.However science and engineering progress all the time pesticides become better more specific fertilizers become better to handle cheaper and less energyintensive to produce GMO crops continue what breeding programs have done in the past that is improve a plant species for more and potentially healthier output with equal production cost.And thus I believe that organic food production is a dangerous fad and that to increase food output and eradicate hunger and malnutriton we must use and improve industrial farming methods using and improving all means available to us intelligently and wisely and without the prejudice of labelling something that came out of a chemical plant as bad while labelling something that came out of a cows arse as somehow magically good and instead have a sane costbenefit analysis that takes into account all that is availabe to us.Quite simply we must not throw away much of the food production techniques what served us well the last couple of hundred years because that could kill a large portion of humans alive today.Change my view.',\n  'label': 'Organic food'},\n {'id': 't3_4oh27m',\n  'argument': '.

Students are also subject to random searches of their person without legitimate concern such as if a teacher or admin hears a rumor that the student may be carrying paraphernalia against policy.',\n  'label': 'oppression in school'},\n {'id': 't3_2dgu6l',\n  'argument': 'My middle school had GATE Gifted And Talented Education to provide gifted kids with extra enrichment so that they could reach their full potential. The students in the gifted classes often got more attention from teachers than other students even if those regular students were just as smart as if not smarter than the gifted ones. I think that if the kids are really gifted they shouldnt need extra help and those enrichment classes should be given to struggling students who would benefit more from the extra work and attention. I also think that stratifying students in this way causes unnecessary selfesteem issues to students who are deemed not smart enough for the gifted classes. Therefore I believe that such classes should be offered for struggling students instead or not offered at all.',\n  'label': 'bright students who cannot achieve their goal'},\n {'id': 't3_5pczop',\n  'argument': 'First off I want this to be USAspecific simply because it is the only government I have lived under maybe if there is some really good counterpoint with another nation I would hear it but I am mainly looking for answers related to the US government. Okay Im not suggesting the removal of government lets get that out first. I know that the real purpose of a government is to protect certain values that a society believes are rights of the citizens it is the governments job to ensure that the food is safe or that some random business allows for equal opportunity I understand that. Heres my general point. There is not a single example of a government organization working with greater efficiency than a corporate or privatesector competitor.',\n  'label': 'state government'},\n {'id': 't3_5ymgm2',\n  'argument': 'Australia is currently rolling out a drug testing policy whereby welfare recipients can be randomly selected for drug tests. If they are found positive they will have of their welfare payments moved to a cashless debit card that only allows purchasepayment of food rent and bills. The remaining will remain cash payments for anything. In my mind this ensures honesty in welfare. It means people on welfare cant waste majority of their money on things like cigarettes which are extremely expensive in Australia or illegal drugs.',\n  'label': 'Tax shelter'},\n ...]"
