The latest polls contain good news for Democrat Barack Obama and Republican John McCain. \nSenator Hillary Clinton and Senator Barack Obama will do battle in 22 Democratic contests around the country, including states with large numbers of delegates like California, New York and New Jersey.\nThe latest national public opinion polls show Obama gaining on Clinton and the race nearly even, but Clinton continues to hold narrow leads over Obama in most of the larger states voting on Tuesday.\nBoth candidates are relying on a last minute barrage of television ads and quick campaign visits to key states to urge their supporters to vote Tuesday.\nObama cast himself as the agent of change at a rally in Delaware. \"I can offer a clear and clean break from the failed policies of George W. Bush,\" he said. \"I will not have to explain my votes in the past.\"\nClinton urged voters to consider her experience during a campaign stop in Missouri. \"My opponent has not had to go through that kind of baptism by fire,\" she said. \"Let us not kid ourselves here. This is going to be open season once again, and we need to nominate somebody with the experience and fortitude and know-how to take whatever they send our way and send it right back.\"\nMore than 1,600 Democratic delegates are at stake Tuesday, 2,025 delegates are required to win the Democratic nomination. In the Republican race, 21 states are holding nominating contests Tuesday.\nSenator John McCain is looking to build on the momentum generated by his wins in the two most recent primaries in Florida and South Carolina.\nMcCain campaigned Monday in Massachusetts and sought to appeal to both Republicans and independent voters. \"As President of the United States, I will preserve my proud, conservative Republican credentials, but I will reach across the aisle to the Democrats and work together for the good of this country,\" he said. \"That is what you want us to do, is work for the good of this country.\"\nMcCain is trying to fend off a challenge from former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney. Romney contends McCain is not conservative enough to be the Republican Party's presidential nominee. \"There is that old saying that if there is a race between a Republican acting like a Democrat and a Democrat, the Democrat always wins,\" he said.\nFormer Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee hopes to do well in some of the southern primaries, while Texas Congressman Ron Paul is looking for a strong showing in Alaska.\nMore than 1,000 Republican delegates are at stake on Tuesday. A total of 1,191 delegates are required to win the Republican nomination. Most political experts predict that the Democratic contest will go on well after the Super Tuesday results.\nThe Democrats use a method of proportional representation to award delegates from the primaries and caucuses, while Republicans generally follow the rule of winner-takes-all.\n\"The number of [Democratic] delegates is large, but they are going to be split in a certain way, so that we will have to go on,\" said John Fortier, who monitors the election campaign at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington and was a guest on VOA's Encounter program. \"But it could be that we could have a clear frontrunner, and I think that is more likely on the Republican side these days. John McCain, I think, has the ability or the prospect of really establishing himself as the clear frontrunner on Super Tuesday.\"\nLooking ahead to the next major contests on the campaign calendar, Maryland and Virginia vote on February 12 while Ohio and Texas hold primaries March 4.

More than 120 people followed the interview live (many from Project Chanology), which makes this exclusive \"Wikinews\" interview our most attended IRC interview to date.\nBunker started XenuTV in 1999 and began to make videos that he provided for the Lisa McPherson Trust. Bunker has been a critic of the Church of Scientology since 1997.\nIn 2006, he won a Regional Emmy Award after he and KUSI-TV news reporter Lena Lewis produced a documentary news video on the issues with the United States - Mexico border with San Diego, California.\nThe Interview.\nWhy don't you start by telling us about yourself and what you do.\nTell us about your history with criticism of Scientology?\nSuch as?\nHas the Church ever been convicted of any crimes?\nHow would you describe yourself in the context of religions, churches, and belief systems, and what you are seeking to accomplish?\nThere are other religions that practice things that are just as bad as Scientology. For example the Catholic Church, Scientology and Islam dislike/sin homosexuals. Why protest Scientology? The Catholic Church, in terms of atrocities, has likely committed more? Even Muslim extremism... Is Scientology really worth more to protest than those religions or any other?\nThat was protest the crime and cover-up? Similar to your work?\nOther than your experiences with ex-members of Scientology, do you have any special qualification that would make you an expert on so-called \"cults\", i.e. do you have a degree in sociology, anthropology, psychiatry, psychology, theology, or any similar related subject area?\nWould that include the fields of tax law, i.e. do you have a degree in accounting, finance, law, or any similar related subject area?\nScientology, as many members have claimed, has saved their lives. Do you think, comparing the circumstances, the good things Scientology has done, outweighs the supposed bad things it has done?\nWhat will it take to get Congressional Hearings to review the Church of Scientology? Specifically, their tax-exempt status.\nWhat, if any, changes or improvements have been made in Church policy and structure since Hubbard died, and more recently too, that might have already addressed, at least partially, issues such as Snow White, Lisa McPherson, disconnection, unrealistic promises of Scientology benefits, etc? On what do you base your answer to this question?\nI assume you mean \"Lisa Clause\"?\nHow do you think most Church members feel about your protests? What would you say to those who would criticize your protests as misguided or the information you post and expose as untrue?\nWe have a somewhat difficult question to put next...Is R2-45 Auditing a joke within Scientology, or is it actually real?\nDo they actually run camps associated with that?\nWhat is the next step we should take in raising the general public's awareness of the atrocities of the \"Church\" of Scientology. Also, besides www.xenutv.com, what are some other, reputable, citable sources of information on these abuses?\nWhy does Scientology accuse people of crimes when they are asked questions?\nWhy do you think Scientology dangerous? From a European (French) point of view there are many strange organizations in the United States (Nazi party, many religious groups). Why is Scientology your fight?\nAnd that's part of the reasons you support 'Anonymous' and \u2014 apart from DDoS \u2014 their actions?\nI've seen your response to their protest on YouTube. You almost seemed proud that a younger generation had \"taken up the torch\".\nWhat happened to Bob Minton? He is alleged to be in favor of Scientology now. Did they give him an 'incentive' to stop his protests of the Church? In a video of yours, posted on YouTube (Scientology: Clearwater Trip - Day 3 - Pt 2), Minton says that the Church attempted to \"pay him money\" several times. Did they finally succeed? Or was he blackmailed into shutting up?\nHow many members of Scientology do you estimate are within the organization?\nWhat is your opinion on Free Zone Scientologists?\nWhat do you think Anonymous should do if Scientologists plant fake anons in a protest and act like idiots to show anons up?\nAre you going to upload the old XenuTV movies (RealVideo) to Google Video or something similar?\nQuestions from IRC users.\nAs you know now, the Anonymous Protests was extremely huge, but we are planning a second round the 15th of March. And I \u2014 a 12-year-old WILL attend, is that a good sign that so young a person wants to be involved, or is it a bad sign?\nCan you put any of this in a historical context? Have you studied the history of Scientology in relation to its \"parent\" organizations (cults praying on the elite) in the 18th - 20th centuries ? (Many of L. Ron Hubbard's ideas were taken directly from OTO which he was a member of in his early life for example).\nBy sheer virtue of numbers, we have become very hard to harass, to the point of the personal risk to ourselves being almost negligible. There have been others before us with far more courage who have spoken up against far greater odds. What do you think the effect of our actions have been on these \"pioneers\"? (yourself included) Do you personally feel that we anons have revitalized the more \"serious\" efforts of those in the past who have come out with full names - and have probably gotten into problems over this? And do you believe it serves to ease the process for those Scientologists who were already considering leaving?\nI was just wondering if you were aware of the many other abuses of other religions such as The Watchtower organization of Jehovah's Witnesses.. They do things strikingly similar to Scientology with regards to killing and abusing members and disconnection policies - now, I'm in no way in favor of the management of Scientology but it does look a little blind to me when these other so-called religions get off scot-free. Have you heard of any such allegations before? My concern is that while a step forward is good against one religion, there are others out there just biding by without no real exposure essentially letting them get away with their abuses. I was also wondering if you knew if The Profit would ever be released for viewing?\nWhat do you say to those people that say that Anonymous and the similar groups are religious bigots?\nIsn't it strange that some countries are recognizing Scientology as an official religion while other countries pursue the Church? What would you say to lawmakers in the former country? Perhaps a short three things you need to know about the Church?\nWhat do you think of the fact that Anonymous' motivations are not a moral outrage and are in fact based on the desire to destroy something and get laughs, aka lulz? What about the fact that Anonymous regularly uses illegal activity for its purposes (though we have suspended most in this raid) and is often risque and perverted in nature? \n\"'How do you feel about the several nicknames given to you, like \"Wise Beard Man\" (WBM), and the several slogans accompanying it? And, by the way, what music do you like?\nThere was a bomb (hoax?) threat video on YouTube by an \"elite anonymous\" as he himself called himself. What would be the implications of such an attack? Could this be another plant by Scientology, and could they actually go through with it?\nSo you would urge Anonymous to report any such threats to the authorities?\nAnything you would like to add Mr. Bunker?"}

Touretzky, prominent free speech activist and critic of Scientology, discussed his opinions on the recent Internet backlash against the Church of Scientology in an interview with former Scientologist and \"Wikinews\" reporter . The recent conflict on the Internet between critics of Scientology and the Church has been spurred on in declarations by a nebulous Internet entity using the name \"Anonymous\" that the Church of Scientology \"will be destroyed\". \"Anonymous\" has directed recent protests at Scientology centres across the world, which have attracted significant numbers of individuals supporting the cause. In recent e-mail correspondence with \"Wikinews\", a representative of the Church of Scientology declared that the Church considers the activities of Anonymous to be illegal, and that Anonymous \"will be handled and stopped\".\nTouretzky, a research professor in artificial intelligence and computational neuroscience at Carnegie Mellon University, has been a prominent critic of the Church of Scientology since mid-1995, and has been protesting against Scientology vociferously since then; he has also run websites that publish material that Scientology wishes to keep suppressed from the public eye, such as extracts from Scientology's formerly-confidential \"Operating Thetan\" (OT) materials. Touretzky views the actions of the Church of Scientology as being \"a threat to free speech\", and has endured harassment by the Church of Scientology for his activities. \nThe Church of Scientology continues to suffer damage to its public reputation through increased exposure on the Internet and vocal protests by Scientology critics such as Prof. Touretzky. A recent event that focused intense attention on Scientology's totalitarian attitude was the leak of an internal Church of Scientology propaganda video to the Internet video sharing site \"YouTube\", in which celebrity Scientologist Tom Cruise spoke heavily in Scientology's jargon and stated that that \"we [Scientology] are the authorities\" on resolving the difficulties of humanity. The declaration of war by \"Anonymous\" followed shortly after this leak, in the form of a video posted to the Internet. \nThe ongoing dispute, cast by some as \"Scientology versus the Internet\", brought Scientology terms such as \"SP\" (\"Suppressive Person\", an enemy of Scientology) and \"KSW\" (\"Keeping Scientology Working\") into general usage by non-Scientologists from the late 1990s onwards; increased attention has been drawn to Scientology by the release of the Cruise video in addition to media coverage. This focus has caused an even greater propagation of these terms across the outside world, as Touretzky comments in the interview.\n\"Wikinews\" asked Prof. Touretzky about the impact that the activities of \"Anonymous\" will have on Scientology, the public relations effect of the Tom Cruise video, the recent departure of individuals from the Church of Scientology's executive management, the strategies that \"Anonymous\" will employ and Touretzky's experiences of picketing the Church."}

On the Republican side, Arizona Senator John McCain surged ahead of his main rival, former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney.\n's early results showed big wins for Hillary Clinton in some very delegate-rich states, including the state she represents, New York, and Arkansas, where she lived when her husband, former President Bill Clinton, was governor. But she also won the state of Massachusetts, in spite of the fact that Massachusetts Senator had endorsed Obama. Clinton also scored victories in New Jersey, Tennessee and Oklahoma.\nBarack Obama won his home state of Illinois as well as Georgia, Alabama, Delaware, Connecticut, Minnesota, North Dakota and Kansas. Although Clinton won in the states with the largest delegate counts, Obama will still garner a large number of those delegates because the Democrats award them by proportion of the vote for each candidate.\nThe biggest Super Tuesday prize, California had Clinton winning on the Democrat side and McCain winning the Republicans.\nOn the Republican side, it was a good day for John McCain, who won seven states in the early hours of vote counting. Mitt Romney, so far, has won his home state of Massachusetts, Minnesota, North Dakota and Utah. Former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee won his home state as well as West Virginia, Georgia and Alabama. Both Huckabee and Romney say they will stay in the race, but analysts say the big wins by McCain have given him the momentum and the delegate lead that could help him clinch his party's nomination fairly soon.\nIn both parties, Super Tuesday was a watershed in that it ended the phase of the campaign when candidates could win a state or two in hopes of building the perception of momentum. From now on it will be a flat-out contest for delegates.\nThe next contests will be this coming Saturday when Louisiana holds its Presidential primary, Kansas Republicans hold caucuses and Democrats hold caucuses in both Nebraska and the state of Washington. The process of selecting candidates for each party will culminate in the national conventions. The Democrats will meet in at the end of August and the Republicans will meet during the first week of September in Minneapolis. "}

All three are being held at the U.S. detention facility at Guantanamo Bay.\nHayden said waterboarding was used against the three detainees nearly five years ago because of circumstances at the time, including the belief that additional attacks against the United States were imminent.\nHayden defended the CIA's use of extreme interrogation techniques as lawful, and urged lawmakers not to impose restrictions on such methods.\nCongress is considering legislation that would restrict the CIA to using only the interrogation techniques authorized by the U.S. Army's field manual, which does not include waterboarding."}

But they are likely to face strong questioning from lawmakers about ongoing war costs.\nWhen President George W. Bush's budget for the 2009 fiscal year was sent to Congress this week, Secretary Gates defended the $515 billion request from the Pentagon.\nIn the overall figure, he noted, are billions of dollars to support U.S. military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan and the administration's global war on terrorism. \"A $70 billion emergency bridge fund that would cover war costs into the next calendar year,\" he said.\nThe story behind that figure is the ongoing struggle between President Bush and the Democratic-controlled United States Congress over war funding.\nLast year, the president asked for about $190 billion in a supplemental request outside the regular defense budget for war costs in the current 2008 fiscal year. The amount approved by Congress, just over $86 billion, left a large gap.\nWhen Gates and military Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Admiral Michael Mullen appear before the House and Senate armed services committees, they will be pressed for harder cost projections, as Congress continues to assess the impact for the U.S. economy of the Iraq and Afghanistan conflicts.\nWhite House Budget Director Jim Nussle was asked this week if the Bush administration has a realistic hope it can obtain its Pentagon regular budget and supplemental war funding requests from an opposition Congress. \"It's worth whatever we need to spend and we have made, I think, a very careful determination of what that is. So, I don't believe it is just a negotiation point. I think it is what it takes for us to be safe, and to be the kind of super power that can maintain that safety,\" he said.\nAsked why budget figures do not appear to reflect a reduction in costs because of the eventual withdrawal of about 30,000 troops from Iraq to pre-military surge levels, expected to be complete later this year, Nussle would only refer reporters to the Pentagon.\nAnd while the question of troop levels will be a key topic for lawmakers, in the context of questioning on the overall Pentagon budget, Gates may not provide much in the way of enlightenment.\nMedia reports quoting testimony prepared for the House and Senate hearings say he will point to what he calls significant variables weighing against making any realistic estimate of how much Congress may be asked for in the final year of the Bush administration.\nBased on numerous supplemental requests for Iraq and Afghanistan in recent years, members of Congress expect the $70 billion bridge fund to be followed by additional requests to sustain U.S. forces.\nAs for the $100 billion or so in 2008 supplemental funds that has been held up by bickering between Capitol Hill and the White House, congressional Democrats are looking to testimony in April from the U.S. commander in Iraq, General David Petraeus.\nThat will provide Congress with an update on progress by Iraqi forces toward shouldering more of the security burden, what that means for U.S. troop numbers, and what Americans can expect to be paying as President Bush leaves office and a new administration takes over in 2009."}

Jenna Miscavige Hill, daughter of David Miscavige's older brother Ron Miscavige, described Scientology policies which broke apart her family and continue to keep members of her family from talking to each other. Hill criticized Scientology practices in a letter to a public relations spokeswoman for the Church of Scientology and in a broadcast of the television program \"Inside Edition\" which aired Tuesday, and was interviewed by an investigative journalist for the \"New York Post\".\nHill wrote an open letter addressed to Karin Pouw, Public Affairs Director of the Church of Scientology International, in response to a 15-page statement issued by Pouw on January 14 which was highly critical of Andrew Morton's new book on prominent Scientologist Tom Cruise, \"Tom Cruise: An Unauthorized Biography\". Hill's letter was posted to the Internet newsgroup alt.religion.scientology on January 25, and has since been widely posted on other Internet message boards. \nIn Pouw's statement on Morton's book, she called it a \"bigoted defamatory assault replete with lies\". In her letter to Pouw, Hill responded \"I am absolutely shocked at how vehemently you insist upon not only denying the truths that have been stated about the church in that biography, but then take it a step further and tell outright lies.\" Specifically, Hill rebuked the Church of Scientology's denial of a practice called \"disconnection\", where members are instructed to sever all ties with friends and family who are critical of Scientology and deemed a \"Suppressive Person\", or SP.\nHill wrote that it was this particular policy which broke up her family when she was 16, going on to detail how the Church of Scientology restricted her communications with her parents: \"Not only was I not allowed to speak to them, I was not allowed to answer a phone for well over a year, in case it was them calling me.\"\nWhen contacted for a comment on Hill's letter, Karin Pouw told the \"Agence France-Presse\": \"The church stands by its statement of 14 January. The church does not respond to newsgroup postings.\" Hill explained her motivation for writing the letter to the \"Agence France-Presse\": \"My intention is to put it on a public forum so they are pressured into changing their ways -- even if it is just to cover for themselves.\"\nIn a broadcast of the television program \"Inside Edition\" which aired Tuesday, Hill spoke with reporter Les Trent about Scientology's disconnection policy. Hill described a pregnant friend whose parents are still members of the Church of Scientology; but will not speak with her: \"She lives in L.A. - her parents live right around the hill from her, you know she tried to call them when she was having her first child, and they were like: 'No, sorry, I can't speak to you.'\" The Church of Scientology told \"Inside Edition\" that the allegation made by Hill is \"the opposite of what the church believes and practices.\" Hill last spoke to her uncle David Miscavige four years ago, around the same time that she viewed a promotional video featuring Tom Cruise, at an awards ceremony. This video was recently leaked to the Internet and appeared on the video sharing site YouTube. YouTube took the video down due to a legal complaint from the Church of Scientology, but though the website Gawker.com received a similar legal complaint, Gawker has stated that the video is newsworthy and will not be removed.\nProminent free speech activist and critic of Scientology David S. Touretzky commented on these recent developments, in an interview Wednesday with \"Wikinews\" reporter : \"She has nothing to do with Chanology [the recent anti-Scientology movement that has gathered on Internet message boards], but what we're seeing here is a \"perfect storm\" of entheta [material considered negative by Scientology]. It's all coming together in a chain reaction: The Tom Cruise video, Andrew Morton's bio, Kirstie Alley's craziness, Kimora Lee Simmons, Jenna Miscavige, and there's more to come!\" Another critic of Scientology, Mark Bunker of the website XenuTV.com, compared the recent revelations to troubles in Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard's family: \"Just as L. Ron Hubbard\u2019s family was rocked with turmoil, so it seems is Miscavige\u2019s.\" Bunker commented on the \"Inside Edition\" piece: \"This is a jaw-dropping TV segment \u2014 although Inside Edition clearly didn\u2019t understand just how important a story they had.\"\nIn an interview published Wednesday in the \"New York Post\", Hill stated that she has been harassed by the Church of Scientology for speaking out against the organization: \"The church has contacted several of my friends, telling them that I am smearing the church and I am going to be declared a suppressive person and asking my friends if they would disconnect from me and, in at least one case, insisting that they do.\" The \"New York Post\" attempted to contact Karin Pouw for a comment, but she did not respond in time for their publication."}

It is known he studied physics at Allahabad University.\nA professor of psychology at the school, Emmanuel Ghosh, says the guru's academic training, combined with study under a Vedic swami, helped to make him accessible to those in the West seeking alternative answers to life's questions during the socially tumultuous 1960's.\n\"He had a rational approach,\" said Ghosh. \"He had a scientific background and he could tell the West that 'You could test my theories through science.' He was the first one who started this whole system of reducing stress by breath control, by meditation and you could measure it in objective terms.\"\nMaharishi also tutored other pop musicians, Hollywood actors and film directors. His TM movement attracted millions of followers worldwide who paid hundreds of dollars to receive a personal mantra to recite for 20 minutes, twice a day.\nProfessor Ghosh at Allahabad University says, despite his fame and success overseas, Maharishi was just one among many gurus in his native India.\n\"His influence in India has been negligible. Every guru is independent to propagate his own method of salvation or nirvana,\" said Ghosh. \"So he took off for a while [in India] as long as he was appreciated in the West.\"\nPerhaps his biggest legacy in India is the country's largest chain of privately owned schools. Other institutes and universities based on his teachings also exist in the United States and Europe.\nIn later years, some of the guru's projects and beliefs earned him ridicule, such as hoping to raise $10 trillion to achieve world peace and banish poverty and encouraging followers to learn what he called \"yogic flying\". While many adherents praise Maharishi for propagating a scientifically verifiable ancient method to help them deal with the stress of modern life, some disenchanted followers considered TM a quasi-religious cult more interested in raising funds than spirits."}

Reaction Engines of Oxfordshire says the A2 plane could be in service within 25 years, carrying 300 passengers at a top speed of almost 4,000 mph, which is twice the speed of the Concorde. It would be able to reach Australia from Brussels Airport, Belgium non-stop in just five hours.\nIt is 143 meters (469 feet) long, which is approximately twice the length of the Airbus A380 and would be the first man-made object to cruise for extended periods at such speeds within the Earth's atmosphere. Man-made aircraft have travelled this fast before; they, however, were inefficient rocket powered aircraft, that were only capable of short range.\nThe cost of a trip on the A2 is expected to be comparable with current first class tickets on standard flights, of around US$6,900 (\u00a33,500), although it is possible prices will drop in the future.\n\"The A2 is designed to leave Brussels international airport, fly quietly and subsonically out into the north Atlantic at Mach 0.9 before reaching Mach 5 across the North Pole and heading over the Pacific to Australia,\" said Alan Bond, the head of Reaction Engines.\nDue to the heat generated in high-speed flight, the plane would have no windows. Instead, television screens connected to video cameras on the outside of the plane will be placed in front of passenger seats.\nThe jet may be more environmentally friendly than other planes because it uses liquid hydrogen for power rather than fossil fuel, and thus would not necessarily produce any pollution during the flight. The energy to produce the liquid hydrogen could come from an environmentally friendly source.\n\"Our work shows that it is possible technically; now it's up to the world to decide if it wants it,\" Bond said."}

CariDee has even lobbied in Congress for the passage of a bill which would ask the National Institutes of Health, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the Institute of Medicine to increase spending on finding a cure for psoriasis. You can read more about her role with the National Psoriasis Foundation here.\n\"Wikinews\" reporter sat down and talked with CariDee earlier in the week to discuss her own issues with psoriasis, how she has helped other sufferers in her role as spokeswoman for the Foundation, as well as what it's like to be a new model in New York City and her thoughts on how the fashion industry operates today.\nThis is the second in a series of articles with \"America's Next Top Model\" contestants. Articles will be published sporadically.\nIntro and her Super Bowl pick.\nMike Halterman: Hi! How are you doing today?\nCariDee English: Fine! Doing good.\nMH: So I heard you went to the Super Bowl last Sunday.\nCE: Oh, no, I didn't get to go! I've been in New York for Fashion Week. Did someone tell you I went?\nMH: Yeah, Jose [her manager at Elite Model Management] told me you had. Well, did you have a team to root for, anyway?\nCE: Of course! I was going for New York! This was the first time that a team won in the state I was living in! I'm from North Dakota, and we don't have any professional teams, so it was pretty cool.\nFrom North Dakota to the big city.\nMH: I'd imagine it's a big change moving from small-town North Dakota to New York City. What do you remember thinking in your first weeks in New York City?\nCE: I don't know...it was kind of overwhelming! I remember being overwhelmed. There were trash and pigeons everywhere...and an endless amount of walking! But you know, I just love how big it is and how there are just...endless dreams. You have the opportunity to accomplish so much here.\nMH: Did you miss home or ever think about just moving back to North Dakota?\nCE: No, I could never move back to North Dakota. What would I do?\nMH: Well, you were a fashion photographer, you could have went back there for some work...although I don't know how much you'd be in demand there.\nCE: Yeah, it wasn't even an option! Not a thought.\nOn representing the National Psoriasis Foundation.\nMH: So you're currently a spokeswoman for the National Psoriasis Foundation. What have you found, in your interactions with others who have had the disease, are their reactions once the disease manifests itself?\nCE: I think a lot of people try to hide away from it, and I want people to be comfortable in their own skin, no pun intended. I just want people to be comfortable with themselves, because I know I hid under clothes for years.\nMH: In your experience as ambassador, what story touched you the most?\nCE: It really makes me upset because there are a lot of great medications out there and the government won't fund payments for patients. There was a 9-year-old boy who was on a great medicine and then his insurance dropped him from it. It came back and it's now covered 95% of his body. You know, it's just heartbreaking to be able to be treated for it and then not be able to afford it.\nMH: Were your reactions to psoriasis and discovering you had it comparable with those of other people?\nCE: No, because I understood what it was when I had it. Other people may be scared of it when they discover they have it, because they might not know what it is.\nMH: Did relating with others with the condition give you a personal boost?\nCE: Oh, yeah, absolutely. Seeing a little boy, healing and still living life, that's an inspiration to me. We're all just trying to be here for each other. No one person is above anyone else, we're just trying to support each other and find a cure together.\nMH: As an ambassador for psoriasis awareness, you've become a role model of sorts to young girls and women who are afflicted with the disease. What kind of advice have you given to people coping with the disease?\nCE: \"I have psoriasis, I don't let psoriasis have me.\" Don't live your life through your disease.\nMH: Do you think that having had obstacles like your psoriasis and depression have helped you enter the industry more grounded than other girls who may not have had such rough experiences?\nCE: Yeah, I mean, I only know my own experiences, but I didn't take anything for granted. I was grateful for being able to start in such a difficult industry and having that background to be able to overcome things on my own.\nOn her former photography work.\nMH: You've worked behind the camera before you stepped in front of it; has this helped you as a model?\nCE: It's helped me to understand the relationship and connection you need to have between a model and photographer, and what the photographer wants out of the model, like what art they want to create, and the importance of it.\nMH: Would you like to step back behind the camera at some point?\nCE: For fun, absolutely. I love doing that for fun, and...recreational, for sure. It'll always be a hobby of mine.\nMH: Experiencing both the photography side of the spectrum as well as being in front of the cameras, what do you deem extraordinary in terms of the aesthetic? What is beauty to you?\nCE: Beauty is having confidence. If a woman is confident in front of the camera, and exudes that confidence, then there's no room for error. So, confidence, definitely.\n\"Top Model\" and her modeling career.\nMH: Obviously your experience on Top Model was very positive. However, has the experience impacted you negatively at all?\nCE: I think the only negative thing about it is that fans seem to think that if you're not on the cover of all these magazines, that you're not getting work. Not everything is covered equally. It's a different age now that a lot of celebrities are on the covers of magazines, and people go \"Oh, well, this show hasn't produced a Top Model!\" We've been doing a lot of work in a lot of different things and I think people forget that.\nMH: I've been following your career, and I've noticed you haven't been doing a lot of runway work as opposed to print modeling, which you've done a lot of. Do you have any fashion shows lined up in the near future?\nCE: I've actually done a lot of runway work, but the thing is that the runway work never gets as much press as the print work does, so I've done a lot more shows than what people have seen on the Internet. It's difficult now too, because a lot of girls have to be \"skinny\" skinny now, and I think I have a good walk and a good spring/summer look, but you know, I'm a size 0. 0 or a 2. I went in to see a fashion designer for the winter designs and I knew I wouldn't be thin enough for this job, and I'm 125 pounds at 5'10\". I'm a grown woman, I'm not prepubescent anymore, so if that means I'm not thin enough and that means I'll lose a job, then you know, I'll take that risk. I'm healthy.\nMH: What is more fun to you, photoshoots or runway?\nCE: I love photoshoots. Runway is great because you do quick hair, makeup, wardrobe, and you get a huge rush from that, but with photoshoots there's a sense of accomplishment, I can see what I've done and get totally \"in my zone.\"\nMH: We know you as wacky and fun-loving on Top Model. Since you've come to New York, what's the wackiest thing you've done?\nCE: It's a hard question! I can't think of any...every moment is wacky in New York! I think one good moment was when my brother and I went out to Times Square at maybe 2:30 in the morning. We went to this 24-hour Starbucks and drank all this coffee, and then we had an artist sketch our picture, and then we went on a buggy ride and we didn't end up getting back home until 5 in the morning. It was a lot of fun.\nMH: How do you reconcile the demands of a potentially busy modeling day with the need to let loose and be free-spirited?\nCE: I'd just jump off the Empire State Building with a parachute. [\"laughs\"] No, I like to go out with friends, go dancing, hit the clubs, but if I have a photoshoot the next day, I just want to stay in with my boyfriend.\nLooking back and what's coming next.\nMH: It's been over a year now since you won Top Model. Was 2007 all you hoped it would be?\nCE: Yeah, and more! It was great. It was the best year so far.\nMH: What one achievement was your favorite?\nCE: Honestly, being the spokesperson for the National Psoriasis Foundation. Not just in the United States, either; I've been to Canada, all over Europe, I loved Switzerland, and then down to Argentina. I'm a global spokesperson for psoriasis, and that's fun to do.\nMH: Anything coming up work-wise you want to share with us?\nCE: Yep! I'm starting my own show with MTV, where I'll be the executive producer and host.\nMH: What's it going to be about?\nCE: I can't say anything yet! But it'll be very funny.\nMH: And finally, do you have any special words for all the Top Model fans out there?\nCE: Oh, Gosh, I have millions of words! [\"thinks about what to say\"] I feel like I'm accepting an award! I want to thank all of you for supporting me and I lean on you guys more than you realize."}

Christchurch Police Commander Dave Cliff told reporters that emergency radio calls informing staff on the ground that the woman claimed to have two bombs on board were sent by the wounded pilots after subduing their attacker.\nThe pilot sustained a severely cut hand while the co-pilot suffered a foot injury.\nThe flight landed at 08:00 NZDT in Christchurch and the woman was arrested by a special Armed Offenders police team, and was taken into questioning. Police and fire units quickly surrounded the plane as it landed, and a witness account said a \"sniper was on the tarmac\". All six remaining passengers were removed from the plane and the pilots were able to walk off before being moved to Christchurch Hospital for treatment.\nPassengers and their luggage on short haul flights within New Zealand are not subject to security checks. This excludes domestic flights departing a New Zealand international airport, however. Air New Zealand, the national carrier who operated the flight through a charter company, told reporters Friday that the company was reviewing security measures across the fleet following the incident.\n\"Today's incident, although a one-off, has naturally given us cause to conduct a thorough review of our safety and security systems and processes on regional domestic flights,\" said Bruce Parton, Air New Zealand's general manager of short-haul airlines.\nPolice searched the plane and are now confident there was no bomb on board, although initial measures were taken to arrange a bomb disposal unit for a possible unit in the woman's bag. The Christchurch Airport was closed for three hours following the incident."}

The results of the investigation were handed over to Pakistani government officials in Islamabad. \nThe findings by Scotland Yard support the Pakistani government's version of how Ms. Bhutto was assassinated after leaving a political rally last December in Rawalpindi. Immediately before she was attacked, Ms. Bhutto was waving to supporters from the roof of her armoured car.\nThe Scotland Yard detectives concluded that Ms. Bhutto died when the force of a suicide bomb blast rammed her head into the roof of the car. The head of Pakistan's team investigating the assassination, Abdul Majeed, read the findings of the British pathologist who assisted with the investigation.\n\"The blast caused a violent collision between her head and the escape hatch area of the vehicle causing a severe and fatal head injury,\" Majeed said.\nTelevision footage of the attack shows a single gunman firing shots toward Ms. Bhutto seconds before the explosion. Investigators determined the person firing the gun was also the suicide bomber.\n\"All the evidence indicates that one suspect has fired the shot before detonating an improvised explosive device,\" Majeed said. \"At the time of the attack this person was standing close to the rear of Mrs. Bhutto's vehicle.\"\nPakistan President Pervez Musharraf invited Scotland Yard to investigate the cause of Ms. Bhutto's death after some of her supporters charged that the government could be involved in the attack and was covering up circumstances of her assassination.\nOfficials of Ms. Bhutto's Pakistan People's Party maintain she was shot during the attack. Even after the results of the Scotland Yard investigation were released, party spokeswoman Sherry Rehman insists that an assassin's bullet hit the former prime minister.\n\"We clearly saw even on footage that she recoiled from a bullet and she fell inside,\" Rehman said. \"The issue really is that this gives us all the more reason to ask for a larger U.N. investigation into what led up to the events of December 27 and to what is behind the hand that pulled the trigger and to who are the financiers, sponsors, organizers and perpetrators of this crime.\"\nThe Scotland Yard report notes that despite the lack of a detailed search of the crime scene or an autopsy of Ms. Bhutto's body, sufficient evidence is available for investigators to draw what they are calling reliable conclusions.\nDetectives relied on X-rays of Ms. Bhutto's head and a detailed examination of video footage of the attack. The British team only investigated how Ms. Bhutto was killed, not who was behind it.\nThe Pakistani government says an al-Qaida-linked militant chief based on the border with Afghanistan is responsible for her killing.\nAt least four people have been arrested in connection with the case, including a 15-year-old boy who told police he was among a five-man suicide squad charged with assassinating the opposition leader.\nMs. Bhutto's death led to widespread rioting and protests and forced a delay of nationwide elections currently scheduled for later this month."}

No guitars, no bass, no keyboards but nevertheless an unbelievable melodic metal experience.\"\nThat's how the official website of van Canto describes the band. Hailing from Germany, van Canto are what is called an a capella metal band, the pioneers of this new genre.\nThe band released their debut, \"A Storm to Come\", in December 2006. Exactly a year later, van Canto announced a global signing to Gun Records/Sony BMG, and their debut was released worldwide on December 14.\nVan Canto are now experiencing considerable success. They recently provided support for Finnish symphonic power metal band Nightwish, as well as receiving a slot at the internationally famous Wacken Open Air festival in Germany. The prestigious event sees them sharing the bill with acts such as Hatebreed, Sonata Arctica, As I Lay Dying, Soilwork, Children of Bodom, Nightwish, Lordi and headline act Iron Maiden.\nVan Canto's second album will be recorded across this month and next, with famed producer Charlie Bauerfeind, although no release date has yet been confirmed.\nIn light of recent events, van Canto member and founder Stefan Schmidt has given the band's first interview in English, all previous interviews being in German or Italian. Wikinews now exclusively brings you that interview below.\nInterview.\nOn the early days.\nAfter the split of my former band Jester\u2019s Funeral I wanted to do something vocal oriented with a heroic attitude. It wasn\u2019t planned to leave out all instruments in the beginning, it was an idea developed in the studio turning out to work great.\nWe are playing melodic metal, so my inspiration as a composer can be found in Blind Guardian and Nightwish. Metallica has always been a great influence for me, too. I don\u2019t listen to many a capella bands, though. There\u2019s a German a capella band called the Wise Guys which I like, but it\u2019s pop and doesn\u2019t have to do much with our style of singing or performing. Combining the metal style with the performing style a capella is the original part of the idea.\nIt wasn\u2019t that hard because we did not do much for it. We just presented our idea and many people liked it, some others didn\u2019t. We don\u2019t put much time in convincing people starting their argumentation with \u201cyou don\u2019t use guitars, this is no metal\u201d. I think everyone who takes the time to listen to our songs or to visit us performing live can see that we really love metal music and love to sing.\nYes, Strilli is still a friend of the band. Van canto first was planned as a studio project among friends. We didn\u2019t expect it to turn out that successful. So Strilli joined the band for recordings and the video shoot although he had I think 4 or 5 bands at that time. When van canto seemed to demand more time, he decided to focus on other projects. It was not a problem for us, because he told us early and still managed to play all shows with us until we had our new drummer\nBastian is my long time band mate since 12 years now. We played together in all our bands, only interrupted by the first van canto year, when he lived in China for one year. After he returned he was the first and only choice to follow up Strilli.\nTo be honest, from time to time we hoped it, but didn\u2019t expect it. If you put that much time in a personal hobby and you notice that the result, the first songs, sound really great, of course you hope that other people like it as well. But the fact that we receive that much positive feedback in shortest time, without any support from a company or management makes us very happy. It shows that metal still works, there are thousands of people out there waiting for new music, fanzine authors working hours and hours on reviews and interviews without getting any money for it. It\u2019s unbelievably great.\nWe got in touch with our current record company in April 2007. They managed to get in contact with the booking company of the \u201con a dark winter\u2019s night\u201d-performances. So we weren\u2019t actually chosen by Nightwish themselves, and it was only for two shows, but nevertheless this was great.\nOf course! We played in front of 15.000 People within 24 hours and every magazine was there to see the first show of the new Nightwish singer in Germany. This was a great experience for us and the audience welcomed us very kindly.\nUnlike the approach we chose with our former bands, we didn\u2019t contact any record company with our self-produced debut, but managed everything on our own. So this time the record companies contacted us after van Canto was recognized in the internet.\nWe did this on our own as well. A friend of ours did all the writing, cutting and effects. We only had to pay a cameraman, a lighting technican and a make-up artist for 13 hours. It was great to see how many professional people have fun doing their work and not demand thousands of euros of a new formed band.\nOn the new album.\nYes, everything works fine. We recorded drums in November and January and will record all voices in March.\nThat\u2019s up to the record company, I think it will be released in summer, so that the Wacken crowd can sing out the new songs.\nIf you do something new, you don\u2019t have any references on how to sound. We noticed many things in the year after the recording of \u201ca storm to come\u201d. We now better know which words and syllables sound good in which context of the song. \nSo I think our bass voice will be \u201cmore bass\u201d our guitar voices will be \u201cmore guitar\u201d and so on. From the songwriting point of view we are still in the melodic metal genre, what we call hero metal. We will also do some covers.\nGreat. He\u2019s a great guy with a very high musical understanding. Having worked with Blind Guardian he definitely knows how to push voices, and many of them, in the right direction.\nIt\u2019s too early to tell, we will first finish the recordings and then see what we can do around the songs.\nWe wait for nothing but are thankful for everything happened so far and everything that is about to happen. Let\u2019s see.\nOn Wacken Open Air.\nNot daunted, but really exited. If we can really manage to shake hand with Iron Maiden I\u2019m sure not being able to speak one comprehensible word, haha. But I guess every band playing on this year\u2019s Wacken will try to shake hands with them so I better not too disappointed if it doesn\u2019t work out.\nOn every festival we played so far, people were first irritated, then a little bit amused and not later than the third song we played most of the people were enthusiastic about our songs. I hope this will be the way it turns out to be in Wacken.\nIron Maiden of course, Nightwish are there and I\u2019m also looking forward to the Avantasia show.\nOf course. I have been there 1998, 1999, 2002 and 2005.\nHmm \u2013 we hope so. We also have a great fan base in Brazil and try to get over there in the summer to do some shows.\nWe don\u2019t know yet.\nThis depends on how long our slot is, but I think the focus will be on the second album then.\nOn the future of metal.\nI don\u2019t know. I think it would be great if other bands tried out so we can share our experience and do not have to find out everything on our own, haha.\nI hope so. When we get mails from musicians or metalbands influenced by our style of songwriting our by the courage for doing something new we feel really great. I only started playing music because I was inspired by other bands as a teenager, it would be great if we could inspire other musicians, too.\nI think the term \u201cthe industry\u201d is too general for that kind of question. I think that today the chances to get heard are better than 10 years ago. Everybody can produce an \u201cok-sounding\u201d album and put up a video in youtube. And if it\u2019s done well and the idea sticks out, the industry will contact the band, which is their job, actually. \nWe all had bad experiences with former bands and former record labels, but most of these labels have been one- or two-man-companies that didn\u2019t have much money to invest. That\u2019s why we decided to do everything on our own until we get a partner that is able to do all the things we do, only better. \nIllegal downloading is not only killing the industry but also the bands behind. You can\u2019t earn much money with music today, so of course I\u2019m not happy when I read a comment under our youtube video saying \u201cwho can rip me the record? Where can I download it?\u201d. I think we offer many possibilities for people who just want to check out one song: We have the youtube video, we have a stream player on our website and you can find lots of live bootlegs in the web. So if you really like the music you should buy a CD to give us the possibility to continue.\nBut I think in metal most people act this way, they really buy CDs because they like to own the cover, the booklet and everything. It\u2019s ok for us.\nI don\u2019t know and that\u2019s the interesting part of it. Metal has been declared being dead about 1000 times and every year there are new bands with new ideas, great musicians and lots of people listening. I think there is much more to come.\nI don\u2019t feel I am in the position of giving advice. We had a good idea, worked hard on it and were a little bit lucky finally. Perhaps it\u2019s the most important thing to make music because you like it, not because you are expecting something. All van canto members have been playing in metal bands for about 10 or 12 years and now it seems as if people start to recognize us. Even if they hadn\u2019t, I\u2019m sure that I would have continued playing metal, because I like it. It\u2019s a very important part of myself, so I don\u2019t waste a thought on leaving that part away."}

This is the first time a Shuttle has docked to the \"Harmony\" module, since its installation in October 2007, during Shuttle mission STS-120.\nPrior to docking, \"Atlantis\" performed a rendezvous pitch maneuver (RPM), rotating the orbiter through 360 degrees in order to allow an inspection of its heat shield.

The comic is known for its geeky humor and minimalist drawing style that generally uses stick figures. Munroe worked as a contractor for before writing xkcd full time in 2006. \nWikinews reporter interviewed Munroe at , Harvard's annual science fiction convention.\nInterview with Randall Munroe.\nSo could you tell us a little about yourself and xkcd?\nRM: xkcd is a webcomic that I started while I was in the middle of more productive things, school and work, that sort of by accident turned into a big thing and eventually became what I did professionally. I quit my job and got out of school and started drawing pictures on the internet. A lot of math and computer people like it, science people. It's sort of nerdy in general.\nSo, you have a somewhat non-standard style rule for typing out \"xkcd\" which I know has caused great consternation on Wikipedia and elsewhere. \nRM: Well, the first thing is, it started off as a screename and an irc nick, where I\u2019m very used to seeing it all lowercase. There are a lot of trendy things, from , the poet, up through businesses that take that sort of thing. It is a big problem for starting sentences. If you want to start a sentence with \u201cxkcd\u201d it seems very wrong not to capitalize it. But I really grew to dislike capital X, lower case \u201ckcd\u201d because that made it seem like a word or a name more than a string of letters. The whole purpose is that it is a really abstract string. Capitalizing it is sort of saying something about it. If you\u2019re used to treating abstract strings in programming, changing case is not a trivial thing. It's changing what the string is. So when it is in its canonical form, that\u2019s the real xkcd, the other forms look wrong to me. So but on the other hand, I try not to make things too hard on people so I say \u201cok, all lower case is preferred if you want to capitalize, I prefer all caps. Mixed case is my third and least favorite choice\u201d But to some extent that\u2019s just style. Not for any particularly important reason. \nThe comic.\nWhen did you realize you had a genuinely successful webcomic? \nRM: When it first started out there was a brief flurry of people when linked to me with Boing Boing and it had only been up for a couple of weeks then, but \u201cwhoa there are lot of people reading this. This is a cool feeling. I like. It's neat seeing so many people respond and laughing and it makes me want to write more\u201d. That was really the turning point so then I did it for a little while. I stopped for that winter, 2005-2006, and then started doing it again, and at that point I was picking up readers gradually. It was continual slow, sort of exponential climb. And from then on, it was just a matter of ok, we\u2019ve hit a hundred readers a day, ok we\u2019ve hit 500. and then a thousand. And at some I, you know, realized \u201cwhoa this is a lot of people.\u201d But it sort of sneaks up on you. \nI should actually apologize slightly if there\u2019s much overlap between these questions and questions you got during the panel. \nR. When I\u2019ve done this so much I have no memory of past questions. You can ask me the same thing three or four times. \nMaybe I should and then go back to the same question later and see. So if you had to give advice to someone starting a webcomic what would you say?\nR. Don\u2019t look at xkcd and think that it means that you don\u2019t have to take care with what you do. There are a lot of comics that have the same general idea, good writers, but they don\u2019t realize that presentation is important. Just because a comic is successful with stick figures doesn\u2019t mean you can make it hard to read; that you should scan it sloppily. It's important to think about it from the readers looking at it, and see from their point of view, like are they going to get it. Another big tumbling block is do not comment on your jokes after you make them, do not write \u201cthis is how I feel about this comic\u201d because then they won't form their own opinions and they won\u2019t believe the ones they\u2019ve formed. Pay a lot of attention to the experience of someone reading it, and keep that in mind.\nI know just from reading the forums on xkcd that some people have been critical as it\u2019s become more of a standardized joke-a-day webcomic instead of a personalized more or less scans of your old pages and artwork. How would you respond to that? \nRM. I guess only about 2% of the population is going to like the strip in the first place so I always expected that there are a lot of people who don\u2019t like the strip and aren\u2019t going to read it. Frequently people started reading for the more artistic stuff and then now want more of that. I don\u2019t really know what to say to that other than that what I\u2019m doing is what I feel like I have to contribute more of. I feel like there are a lot of people who are good at the kind of art they are doing and you know, have better messages there. Whereas when I\u2019m telling a joke and I get it just right that\u2019s what I\u2019m doing well. I\u2019m just just doing whatever I think I can do well and will be proud of and so if that wanders from one thing to another over time, that\u2019s not something I can control. \nThat\u2019s related actually to the next question. You have a separate forum for discussion. And the forum not only has discussion on the comic but has, ah serious business and news and sections for math and science and pretty much a lot different things. So how is that? Whats your experience with the forums fora, and related to that what made you decide to add the additional, you know, topical to xkcd but more tangential. If you could comment more directly on what the thought process is there?\nRM: I\u2019m less involved in the forums than some other people. Davean is in the business with me is running the forums with me, and my old roommate Belial. \nI hadn\u2019t thought of the IRC readers as potentially different from the forum readers so I\u2019m wondering if other than the obvious connection, aside from the obvious correlation you\u2019re going to get from IRC being more technical, a little more difficult to use obviously. Have you noticed any other differences in the types of people on IRC as opposed to the forum users.\nRM: Really I feel they\u2019re pretty similar. I wouldn\u2019t say that it's more difficult or that there is a higher barrier of entry. We get just as many dumb people on IRC as we get on the forums. Just as many trolls or people wandering in. Every community has its trouble causers and the really good people and everyone sort of mixing. I don\u2019t think that the demographics are all that different really. It's just a matter of which medium you\u2019ve had more experience with and are more comfortable in. \nYou also have your \"blag\" which is really a blog.(Comic 148 Mispronouncing) What about that?\nRM. The blag is a fun thing. A project for me. as for the community on the blag, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s much of a community. There are people who read it, mainly when it gets linked to by something. There are people who are reading it and commenting but they generally are talking back and forth to me, they\u2019re not talking to each other as much so I feel like that\u2019s just a place to talk about interesting, science technology and funny things. There haven\u2019t been a lot of posts so far. It's sort of a young thing so we\u2019re sort of waiting to see where that goes.\nWhat\u2019s your favorite xkcd comic? \nRM: There are some, ones where I feel like I got things right. I\u2019ve always liked the ball-pit one. Hearing about how people like it and how people respond to it makes me like it even more. There have been a lot of new ones where it would be easier to name, but the ones that have been around long enough people have really responded to way back when the answer to this was the comic about the MC Hammer slide, and I liked that one. I feel that one worked out pretty well. There have been a lot in the last year or so, last 6th months that where I felt I got things right. The one with the internet map made it all over the place, and since then there have been a few where they\u2019ve been so well-reviewed that I think of them as high points of the strip. But I don\u2019t know; I have soft spot that\u2019s sort for the silliness of some of them. \nYou've had comics that have included actual people such as . What has been your reaction to meeting people you\u2019ve discussed or mentioned or made fun of, or gently poked in the comic?\nRM: It\u2019s extremely surreal. And I mean just discovering that my, this is a normal person, and this is someone from my history books and I\u2019m sitting here eating food with them. And that has not stopped being weird. And a lot of the time I feel like I should be having more substantial conversation than I am. I\u2019m almost at a loss because it's such an enormous feeling. It makes me realize why people act so weird when they meet me, because I might be the same to them. \nSo is there anyone you\u2019ve put in the comics that you\u2019d like to meet but haven\u2019t?\nRM: for a while now. My fans have been acting out my comics and I was making them weird and the fans were still acting them out. So I was just like, I\u2019m going to make one that is impossible for you to make happen and then that can be the standing challenge. If someone can do that then I can start worrying about this again. And so I had Janeane Garofalo jumping a motorcycle off of a crashing space station towards a volcanic island with dinosaurs while she is armed with a tranquilizer gun. I figured that would be good. The reason I mentioned her was because I\u2019ve been watching some of her movies and she\u2019s just adorable. \nSomewhat on that topic, there was\u2014I don\u2019t know if you saw it\u2014there was a website that had a fake news article about a hundred xkcders commit suicide by imitating one of your comics.\nRM: I read that, I forgot exactly what site it was maybe BBspot. \n\"Note it was BBspot. See\nSo that's the sort of thing you're thinking of in terms of people imitating things? \nRM: I generally don\u2019t worry about you know, that people are going to do something deadly because I mention it. That would be bad but I don\u2019t think that would be my responsibility if that happened. I do sort of wonder about is, people acting out something that has negative effects on the community. If I put some kind of prank that in real life that would be mean-spirited or hurtful and if someone does that to someone famous and would lead to tension and bad feelings, then I would feel bad.\nYou did say on your blag at one point that \u201cBut remember, I am not advocating doing anything dangerous unless it\u2019s really cool.\u201d.\nRM: Yeah well, that\u2019s sort of my running thing. That was sort of a response to people who were really concerned about blame and always have disclaimers that say \"by the way, we don\u2019t endorse this\". I\u2019m like, do you mean that? Do you have to say that? Can you say that? If you say \"I do endorse this\" does this change things? What if I say I endorse it if it's really cool. And I don\u2019t know. When I do something it's my responsibility; I\u2019m deciding whether to take that risk and if someone gets an idea from me and goes and does something dangerous that\u2019s up to them. I didn\u2019t say well do dangerous things no matter what, so...\nThe man in the black hat seems to at least many readers to be one of your favorite characters. Can you talk about him a bit?\nR. Well, I decided early on that I sometimes wanted to be an asshole and sometimes I wanted to be sappy and romantic. And unlike the nerdiness and the romance, the asshole seemed harder to reconcile in one character and make that believable. I started putting the man in the hat, when I just wanted to say the most absurd thing. A lot of the time, I\u2019m in a real life situation and I think what\u2019s the most hurtful thing, what\u2019s the worst way this can go, and have someone do that gleefully. That\u2019s just a recipe for comedy right there. Then I have the guy in the hat so I\u2019d put all that on him and then say \u201cbut that\u2019s not the main guy, he\u2019s much nicer than that\u201d and, and I took that, the black hat symbolizes that for me because Aram from the now ended webcomic also wore a hat. \nSo it\u2019s not in the hacker sense?\nR. No, it\u2019s actually a black hat because there are only so many articles of clothing you can draw on a stick figure. I realized that I associated a black hat with gleeful asshole and that was a character I liked a lot of a since ended strip.\nSpecific comics.\nRegarding Comic 304, \"Nightime Stories\" - or ?\nR. Speaker for the Dead is a much more grown up book. I felt much less of a connection to growing up so I would say Ender\u2019s Game. I\u2019ve read Speaker. I appreciate it some extent. I didn\u2019t feel as personal as Ender\u2019s game. And I didn\u2019t respond to it the same way. I reread Ender\u2019s Game every half a year or so for quite a while. Probably 12 or 15 times now where it just was such an engaging story and such an engaging set of characters. I went back to it over and over. And that\u2019s something I haven\u2019t done with any of the other books in that section of the Ender\u2019s series.\nThat comic made fun of and didn\u2019t mention the final book at all. Do you have an opinion there? \nR. I have not read either of those books since high school, and for me that\u2019s getting further and further away. So I haven\u2019t read either of those books in 6 or 8 years. My memories of Children of the Mind are that at least had had the end of the story there and so at least playing out, and being \u201cok, that happened.\u201d I don\u2019t remember all the details but that there was something to it. All my memories of Xenocide are a girl with obsessive compulsive disorder and Chinese history for many pages. So I didn\u2019t have very good feelings to Xenocide. But neither of those two did I feel were on the same levels as Ender\u2019s Game or Speaker for the Dead. I just picked Xenocide as the most clear target of them.\nHave you seen Orson since this conference started?\n\"( was the featured speaker at Vericon)\nR: I have not. I have a t-shirt though that he signed.\nObviously he\u2019s aware this specific one about Xenocide.\nR: Xenocide followed from that joke I decided to make. I wanted her to be reading a book and wanted him (the character) to object to it and I worked out how the conversation should go. And then I asked ok who should I pick on? I ended up with Xenocide because I just don\u2019t have great memories of it. It could be if I reread it I\u2019d enjoy it. But um.\nBut you did say in the alt-text, \u201ccue nasty emails from all 7 seven fans of Xenocide\u201d. So it seems you understood that it was one of Orson\u2019s less popular works at best\nR: I can\u2019t resist getting in another crack like that. Even if that\u2019s not true, it's funny to say so. It's like whenever you say anything about, about \u201cwe\u2019ve offended the persons in favor of what we don\u2019t like here\u201d you can always throw in \u201cfortunately that\u2019s not many people that don\u2019t like that thing\u201d. That\u2019s almost a standard gag.\nDid you actually try the 28 hour day?(Comic 320, 28-Hour Day)\nR: Yeah. I tried it a couple times in fact. I\u2019m coming off of a 5 day period of doing that when I was rolling my schedule around. So I found that if I do it for more than a week I start to go crazy. \nThat\u2019s exactly what you said in the alt-text actually.\nR. Yeah that was. it gets to be the Sunday mornings where you have to stay up until the afternoon and nothing is happening. And no one is awake . The campus is dead. The apartment is dead. The internet is dead. And you have to stay awake, and you\u2019ve already been awake for 14 hours. That\u2019s when I\u2019d fail at that. And then I\u2019d fall asleep. And then you\u2019re back on the standard college student schedule. And that\u2019s when it always failed for me. And I\u2019d always start to feel really tired in the middle of the day even though from the equations I shouldn\u2019t.\nOn Wikipedia and Wikinews.\nR. It is interesting talking to any wikiproject. You aren\u2019t talking to one person you are reading the words of a community and so now I\u2019m almost feel like I\u2019m not talking to you across the table I\u2019m talking to some random internet mass and so you know \u201chello, internet, what are you doing on this page? Are you browsing this from work?\u201d There\u2019s an odd feeling to it. I\u2019ve also have this urge to play with wikirules. I wanted for a while to find something I could say in an interview that couldn\u2019t be repeated on Wikipedia.\nI was thinking something almost like saying making a sentence that in some way depends on the way it's presented on Wikipedia and if you try to present it on Wikipedia with a neutral point of view by virtue of taking that action you are changing the point of view to do something.\nI wanted to do an announcement saying that I could threaten to commit a crime or threatening to donate money to a charity. This money will go the charity determined by the placement of this comment in the Wikipedia article about this. \nSo by making the decision about where to place it you would be making the decision about how the real life event would go and how the rest of the article would go. And if you make it important enough people can\u2019t just cling to the guidelines and say I\u2019m writing it the best way, and if you make it something like a million dollars to either Africa or Asia, hunger relief suddenly you have the responsibility\nI\u2019m almost worried about including that in the interview, just because I could see some sufficiently rich troll actually implementing that. \nR: Hey, if you don\u2019t put it in the article, I\u2019m going to talk about this.\nSo in general how has you experience been with Wikipedia? How did you first here of it, and actually have you heard of Wikinews before this interview?\nR: I\u2019ve been on Wikinews a number of times. Whenever there is a news story where the data is still being sorted out, there have been press releases but no one is really sure what\u2019s going on, it's sometimes the place to go, to see. Information will always be being added. I feel that like if there\u2019s a piece of information that got out there it's on Wikinews, it won\u2019t disappear and be ignored. What will happen is sometimes there will be a couple of different sources. You go to the news sources and you don\u2019t know which of those sources they have. And so then you go the next one, and you have a different sort of information. And so Wikinews is sort of sticky, someone with one source came in and gave their information. Someone from this source came in and gave theirs. They\u2019re all going to build up slowly there.\nYeah. I think very highly of Wikipedia. I think that\u2019s most of the criticisms about it are completely missing the point. The reason Wikipedia is useful is not because it has a similar error rate to Britannica for example. That\u2019s one thing you often see in comparison. I think that a lot of the criticism of Wikipedia misses a key point -- that the way people interact with Wikipedia is fundamentally different from interaction with any other reference source in history. Wikipedia is a system for pooling information. It's where you go to find the consensus of interested parties backed up by citation. Yes, someone can edit an article and cause harm, but someone can also shoot you in the face while you're walking down a street. It doesn't make walking on streets a broken behavior. People use Wikipedia, by and large, properly -- as a glance at the collected pool of information on a subject, to figure out what something is or how it works. It's not a scholarly reference book, and I don't know anyone who treats it like one.\nPolitics and religion.\nNow we\u2019re going to move on to something fairly controversial, because just I can\u2019t resist. Religion and politics. You criticized and in the same strip (Comic 258, Conspiracy Theories) make a bug report to God. It's not clear how much the strip represents your own religious views but how much does that one? How much do others? \nR: It\u2019s a hard balance. I try to avoid being preachy because I can just talk endlessly for anything especially when someone is listening to me because it's part of their job. I could go on and on. I\u2019ve avoided making the comic too personal just to avoid people feeling like they are reading someone else's stuff. They should feel \"that could be me.\" If I were like this is the part that represents me and this isn\u2019t that takes away from some of that. But I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any contradiction there. I think that Young Earth creationism is such a fringe idea that this concept that the Earth is young is not representative of anything that\u2019s real spirituality. That\u2019s a misunderstanding. They are looking at science and then convincing themselves that their ideas are scientific and then really thinking we\u2019re doing science here and deceiving themselves. It seems much more like a delusion than anything to do with the validity of religion. And for making a bug report to God- Einstein would talk about God all the time. It's sort of a device. Einstein didn\u2019t believe in God not in the way we talk about it today. But he\u2019d talk about understanding what God did when he made the universe in looking at physics. That\u2019s sort of the same way I approach that. It\u2019s a convenient device. It\u2019s a way to make a joke or something. At one point I referred to the \u201cthe gods\u201d as a multiple thing because that works just as well I feel like.\nThe Ron Paul strip (Comic 367, Fandom) got a lot of interesting reactions particularly on your forum.\nR: I just battened the hatches and didn\u2019t listen and didn\u2019t read any of it. I was like ok, I\u2019m going to do a joke here. The joke involves Ron Paul and I like the joke. I\u2019m now going to just hide from any political fall out... but anyone who has looked at Ron Paul at any length probably realizes that there are a lot broken things about our system and want someone who will just up and fix those things. And Ron Paul has a lot of ideas. We should just change this, this is just right, we should sweep away all this argument, all these structures that have built up and just follow the Constitution, and there are some good ideas. At to how practical it is, that\u2019s to be debated in a case by case basis. But I like the freshness of it all, that\u2019s not to say I\u2019d necessarily vote for him that\u2019s I\u2019d necessarily would vote against him. He seems to represent actual \u201clet\u2019s think about this, let\u2019s come up with the best idea. Lets do it because it's right.\" and I\u2019m all in favor of that attitude.\n\"Note: Shortly after this conversation, Munroe endorsed Barack Obama, pointing to among other things Obama's consultation with known for fighting for looser copyright restrictions and for making . Munroe said the following in a follow-up email\": \nR: Although pretty important, I don't think that copyright, or more broadly internet policy in general, should be someone's main reason for supporting a candidate. I chose it because I think it's a good example of Obama's decision-making and what sets him apart from so many politicians, and because it provided a convenient background to segue into talk about his anti-corruption efforts and to leadership in general."}

By 11:00 p.m. the fire had spread over to the roof of the gate. The Korean Fire Department reports that the second blaze had started as the Department was seeking permission from the Korean Cultural Heritage Administration to dismantle parts of the gate in order to stop any possible further fires from spreading. \nAt about 12:40 a.m. of the 11th, the second floor had collapsed, and the fire was spreading to the first floor; at 1:50 a.m. the first floor collapsed.\nOfficials have yet to reach a conclusion on the origin of fire, and have presented three possibilities; arson, electric faults or accidental origins.\nAs the interior of the second floor of the Gate is off-limits to civilians, the Korean Fire Department initially eliminated the possibility of arson, and stated that an electric short or spark from the electric lighting could have been the cause. This possibility was later discarded as a firefighter reported, after examination, that there was no electric wiring on the second floor, as Korean Cultural Heritage Administration regulations prohibit it.\nThree eye-witnesses have submitted testimonies. A taxi driver has reported seeing a man in his fifties climb up the staircase carrying a shopping bag, shortly after seeing sparks. Police have stated that the driver's testimony differs in several crucial factors from the other two witnesses. \nFirefighters have reported finding two cigarette lighters on the second floor, inceasing the possibility of arson as the cause.\nPolice have been unable to obtain evidence from the four closed circuit televisions(CCTVs) installed around the gate.\nOfficials of the Korean Cultural Heritage Administration have stated that restoration will take two to three years and will cost 20 billion won, equivalent of 21 million USD. \nOfficials report that no sprinklers or fire alarms were installed inside the gate, and only eight fire extinguishers were placed on both the first and second floor.\nNamdaemun, built during the Joseon Dynasty, is the oldest wooden structure in Seoul and was entitled 'National Treasure No. 1' in 1962 after restoration.\nIn recent years, arsons started by evangelical Christians have damaged many Buddhist temples and Korean momuments."}

Reinado, a former major, was charged with murder after leading rebel soldiers in the 2006 East Timor crisis.\nCamara said the shooting took place at 4:30 am local time, when two cars passed the president's residence in Areia Branca, two kilometers outside of the capital. According to Camara, the group \"assaulted him, but after rapid reaction by security, his attackers fled\". One of the president's guards was killed in the attack, Camara said.\nRamos-Horta's current condition is serious, but stable, according to doctors at the Royal Darwin Hospital. \"This is a very traumatic and a nasty event - high-velocity, high-powered weapons shooting somebody in the chest in the abdomen are nasty injuries, but we would be very hopeful and cognoscente of a good recovery,\" said Len Notaras, the hospital superintendent. Notaras says he has found three bullet wounds, two in the stomach and one in the back.\nThe president was initially taken to a hospital at an Australian military base in Dili.

Included in his list of confessions were the failed shoe-bombing in England and 1993 bombing of the World Trade Centre, trying to assassinate Jimmy Carter, Bill Clinton, Pervez Musharraf and Pope John Paul II, the beheading of reporter Daniel Pearl in Pakistan, the Nightclub bombing in Bali, plots against oil tankers in Singapore and an oil company owned by Henry Kissinger, plans to blow up the Panama Canal, Heathrow Airport, the Sear Towers in Chicago, the Empire State Building in New York and the Library Tower in Los Angeles, attacks against a number of nightclubs in Thailand, shooting down an Israeli plane, destroying suspension bridges and bombing a hotel in Kenya and targets in South Korea. He also confessed to attacks and plots in Kuwait, Australia, Turkey, Japan, South Korea and Indonesia. William Glaberson of \"The New York Times\" has suggested that the willingness to confess to every accusation presented against him might make it more difficult for prosecutors to establish the validity of his confessions.\nMohamed al-Kahtani, one of sixteen people accused of being a \"20th hijacker\", has recanted his confessions that he had ties to Al Qaeda, had been sent to serve as a hijacker, and that he recognised thirty other captives as bodyguards of Osama bin Laden. He has stated that he was tortured and his family was threatened - in order to force his confessions. A copy of his interrogation log documented that he had been subjected to almost two months of continuous sleep deprivation, with three shifts of interrogators working around the clock to keep him disoriented. His interrogation log documents that he was bound to chairs and force-fed, and administered enemas and IVs, in order to keep his body functioning during his extended sessions..\nWalid bin 'Attash faces charges that he helped run a training camp in Lowgar, Afghanistan that trained two of the hijackers, and that he observed airport security during a flight to Malaysia, to aid the hijackers.\nRamzi Binalshibh is accused of helping the attackers enroll in American flight schools, been in frequent communication with them helped finance their time in the United States.\nAli Abdul Aziz Ali is alleged to have helped finance the hijackers' stay in the United States, teaching them to find hotels, use travellers' cheques and fit into Western culture.\nMustafa al-Hawsawi, originally thought to be another alias of Ali's, is likewise accused of helping the hijackers buy Western clothing, sign up for credit cards and financing their stay before the attacks.\nThe charges will be referred to Susan J. Crawford, appointed the convening authority of the Guantanamo military commissions last year, to determine if there is probable cause for proceedings to continue.\nThe commissions were established in 2006, after the Supreme Court ruled in Hamdan v. Rumsfeld that the system of tribunals was illegal, violating both International and American laws designed to ensure the fair treatment and trials of captives. The tribunals have been criticized for only being used against a handful of detainees, and not reaching a verdict on any of the cases."}

This was completed at 19:00, about an hour later than planned, owing to the installation taking longer than expected. \"Columbus\" was lifted out of the payload bay of \"Atlantis\" at 19:55 UTC, by the Space Station's robotic arm, Canadarm2.

They loosened bolts holding a nitrogen tank in place on the port truss segment of the Station, ahead of its replacement. It was originally planned that they would also disconnect pipes and electrical connections, however these objectives were delayed to Wednesday's spacewalk, due to time constraints.

Thousands of people converged on Canberra, the capital city, to witness the event. Many Indigenous people set up camp on the lawns outside Old Parliament House at the site of the Tent Embassy which has been on the site since Australia Day 1972.\nThe front doors of Parliament House opened at 7:30 a.m. with many people queuing from before 7 a.m. to gain a place inside. With the House of Representatives public gallery packed, about a thousand people watched a live telecast of the event on screens that had been set up for the event in the Great Hall. A special area was set up at the front of the Hall for members of the Stolen Generation. Thousands of others watched outside Parliament House, gathering on the lawns of Federation Square. Some members of the crowds wore t-shirts with the word \"Thanks\" on the front. Many more people watched at venues across the country.\nAll living past Prime Ministers, with the exception of John Howard, were in the chamber to witness the apology.\nThe Prime Minister's speech was received warmly by the crowds and received a long standing ovation at its conclusion. During the Opposition Leader's speech, a majority of the audience in the Great Hall and Federation Square turned their backs. \nThe Apology.\nThe motion was presented to the house as the first item of business at 9 a.m. on the second day of the new Parliament. It was read by Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, and said (in part):\nAfter the formal apology, Rudd gave a speech in which he referred to specific members of the Stolen Generation, and also addressed some common arguments against the apology. \nHe told the story of Nanna Nungala Fejo, an Aboriginal woman born in the late 1920's. \"She remembers her earliest childhood days living with her family and her community in a bush camp just outside Tennant Creek. She remembers the love and the warmth and the kinship of those days long ago, including traditional dancing around the camp fire at night. She loved the dancing,\" Mr Rudd said. \"But then, sometime around 1932, when she was about four, she remembers the coming of the welfare men ... What they had not expected was that the white welfare men did not come alone. They brought a truck, two white men and an Aboriginal stockman on horseback cracking his stockwhip. The kids were found; they ran for their mothers, screaming, but they could not get away ... Tears flowing, her mum tried clinging to the sides of the truck as her children were taken away to the Bungalow in Alice, all in the name of protection.\"\nMr Rudd criticised the former government for refusing to apologise. \"These stories cry out to be heard; they cry out for an apology. Instead, from the nation\u2019s parliament there has been a stony, stubborn and deafening silence for more than a decade,\" he said.\nResponses.\nOpposition Leader Brendan Nelson spoke in Parliament after Kevin Rudd. He reiterated the apology made by Rudd. \"We formally offer an apology to those Aboriginal people forcibly removed from their families through the first seven decades of the twentieth century,\" he said. \nNelson had a different take on the issue of inter-generational responsibility. \"Our generation does not own these actions, nor should it feel guilt for what was done in many, but not all cases, with the best of intentions,\" he said. \"But in saying we are sorry - and deeply so - we remind ourselves that each generation lives in ignorance of the long term consequences of its decisions and actions. Even when motivated by inherent humanity and decency to reach out to the dispossessed in extreme adversity, our actions can have unintended outcomes.\" \nNelson spoke against compensation to children forcibly removed from their parents. \"There is no compensation fund, nor should there be. How can any sum of money replace a life deprived of knowing your family?\"\nIn the Great Hall the crowd grew uncomfortable during the Opposition Leader's speech and the majority of the audience stood and turned their backs to the screens on which he was being broadcast. As the speech progressed a slow clapping began which drowned out Dr. Nelson's speech.\nThe crowds in Federation Square, the gardens outside Parliament House, also turned their back on the Opposition Leader.\nOne of the first to stand and turn his back in the Great Hall was Chris Osborne, representing the State Executive of the United Services Union of N.S.W. Mr. Osborne told a Wikinews reporter that his son had Aboriginal heritage and his sister-in-law was a member of the Stolen Generations. Regarding Dr Nelson's speech he said that the Opposition Leader \"had not learnt and understood the fundamental issues\" and said that he had presented a \"begrudging apology\".\nA member of the Stolen Generations interviewed by Wikinews said that she had personally resolved the issues in her life and had made a success of it, but was pleased that the Nation had made the apology. She said that she did not turn her back on the Opposition Leader as she believed that it was better to listen to what people said and then take from it what was useful. Another Indigenous person said that he felt that people would leave the event with a spirit of hope and optimism. Of Dr. Nelson's speech he said that the Opposition Leader: \"...had us for a nano-second and then he lost us. He lost the spirit.\"\nLive telecast.\nThousands of people gathered throughout the country to watch a telecast of the apology. \nIn Sydney, 1,000 people gathered the Redfern Community Centre in Redfern, an inner city suburb that is a focal point for Sydney's aboriginal community. The event was organised by the City of Sydney and number of Indigenous organisations.\nAn aboriginal smoking ceremony was performed before the telecast, and attendees were welcomed to the land by a member of the Metropolitan Local Aboriginal Land Council. \nAs the live telecast began it started to rain. This didn't deter the participants, who sheltered under ponchos and umbrellas. Rudd's apology was met by cheers and applause. The crowd booed at the mention of former Prime Minister John Howard. \nThe sound of the live telecast was turned down after Rudd's speech, so that the Lord Mayor of the City of Sydney, Clover Moore could speak. She acknowledged the traditional owners of the land and declared her support for the apology, but also said that it was a first step only and that there was much work to be done on the way to reconciliation. \"For the first time, we have acknowledged the history of this country, and the privilege to live in this country,\" she said. \"But we have to ask ourselves: what's the cost of that privilege? Who paid the price?\"\n\"In our hearts we know the costs, whether in child-abuse, in petrol sniffing in remote communities, and drugs, and alcohol in the city districts.\" "}

The wording of the apology will be revealed after 5pm AEDT (UTC+11) today, and will be read in parliament tomorrow at 9am AEDT. \nOpposition leader Brendan Nelson has given in-principle support to an apology, but has criticised the government for the delay in releasing the wording. He has written his speech without seeing the apology. \n\"If Mr Rudd wants to unify Australia, to bring our nation together, the most important person he should be negotiating with is me,\" Mr Nelson said yesterday. \"We're two days away from this, for goodness sake. He should be sitting down with me and saying 'these are the words which we propose, what do you think?\" \nPrime Minister Kevin Rudd said that the words must be tabled to parliament first. \nThe Government's manager of business, Anthony Albanese, said that it was more important for members of the Stolen Generations to approve of the apology. \"Quite frankly, what's important is the people most affected are comfortable with that wording,\" he said. \nIn an opinion piece in today's \"The Sydney Morning Herald\", Tony Abbott defended John Howard's legacy. \"Its refusal to say 'sorry' meant that Howard never received the credit he deserved for groundbreaking policies such as the intervention in Northern Territory Aboriginal townships,\" Mr Abbott wrote. \"The Liberal Party's decision to support an apology to stolen children is not a repudiation of John Howard. It should help us to defend a key part of his legacy, the Northern Territory intervention, and to pursue good policy without accusations of bad faith.\""}

The paper solicited the cartoons for an article that explored \"self-censorship\" with regards to criticism of Islam. One of the cartoonists that responded was Kurt Westergaard, who contributed an image of Muhammed with a turban that looks like a bomb.\nPET says that Westergaard was the target of an alleged plot to murder him. At 4:30 a.m. CET (UTC+1), in a pre-dawn raid, they arrested three men in Aarhus, Denmark. The men, two Tunisians and one Danish citizen of Moroccan origin, are suspected of planning to kill Westergaard.\nPET commissioner Jakob Scharf said, \"The purpose of the clampdown was to prevent a terror- related homicide. The clampdown occurred after a long period of surveillance.\"\nThe Danish citizen has been released. It is thought that this means that the evidence against him is not very strong. However, the 40-year-old man \"will continue to be of interest for the PET\" says Scharf.\nThe two other men, said to be 25 and 36 years of age, and who by all accounts were in Denmark legally, face deportation back to Tunisia. They are due to remain in custody until a judge can review their case on Thursday. \"I have no idea about what is going to happen next. The ball is in the court of PET, and they are they ones who need to start talking and explain the meaning of all this. I have no idea what the next step is,\" said the public defender assigned to the Tunisians.\nThe government and the PET has yet to present their case in court. As a result, it is unknown what evidence there is of a plot. Also, it is unknown if the men were under orders from groups outside of Denmark, as has been speculated by media.\nHowever, Scharf says that the pre-emptive police action \"was to prevent a planned killing of one of the cartoonists behind the Muhammed-drawings.\" The primary objective was not to jail or deport anyone, but to prevent a murder.\nThe Prime Minister of Denmark, Anders Fogh Rasmussen, commented: \"Unfortunately, this case shows, that in Denmark, too, there are groups of extremists, who do not recognize and respect the founding principles upon which the Danish people's government is built.\"\nMeanwhile, the editors-in-chief at the three biggest newspapers in Denmark have seen the alleged plot as a threat to their freedom of speech. These papers are \"Jyllands-Posten\", \"Politiken\" og \"Berlingske Tidende. \" To reassert their rights they all plan to republish the controversial Muhammad drawings on Wednesday.\n\"We must in Danish media send a clear and unambiguous message to all, that might get the same insane thoughts, as those who would attack Kurt Westergaard,\" says \"Berlingske Tidende\" chief-editor Lisbeth Knudsen.\nWestergaard, who is 73 years old, has been under police protection since he received death-threats shortly after the original publication of the cartoons. \"I fear for my life, when the police tell me there are certain people who are working with concrete plans to kill me,\" he says."}

The blacklisting was noticed when Finland's second largest Internet service provider Elisa started blocking the page today. More of the ISP's are expected to join the filtering when their blacklists are updated from the police's master list. \nThe banned site has been a harsh critic of Internet censorship over the last three years. It contains information and news about how censorship has been discussed and developing in Finland. Although the site's provocative name is lapsiporno.info (\"childporn.info\") there is no child porn on the site - the content is mainly text.\nTekniikka &amp; Talous magazine asked Commissioner Lars Henriksson of Finland's National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) why the page was censored. His answer was that he cannot discuss individual sites, but said that sites which are linking to child porn pages are also within the scope of the law. This interpretation, however, seems to conflict with the actual laws, the scope of which was supposed to be only sites with illegal pictures in foreign countries. \nOn Wednesday, NBI confirmed that site was censored because it published and maintained an incomplete version of the Finnish child porn blacklist. Nikki's list contained roughly two-thirds of the 1500 blacklist entries, and it was created by scanning a large amount of sites and logging the censored pages. \nThe scan also found that the top three results of a Google search for \"gay porn\" are blacklisted, and that most of the blocked sites are actually physically located in the United States or the European Union. \nLeena Romppainen of Electronic Frontier Finland commented that \"The local authorities have taken no action on these sites. Therefore, either the sites do not contain child pornography or the NBI has not informed the local authorities. Both of the alternatives are equally scary.\" \nMatti Nikki's opinion is that the majority of the censored sites are legal adult sites and that the police are not doing that much research when they are deciding which sites to block. \nInternet censorship has been a hot topic in Finland as of late.

You may not think you have ever heard , but chances are on a television program, a movie, a commercial, or as 's voice guru in the 1990's, you have heard him. West's talent for creating personalities by twisting his voice has made him one of a handful of voice actors\u2014 and the late come to mind\u2014who have achieved celebrity for their talent. Indeed, West is one of the few voice actors who can impersonate Blanc in his prime, including characterizations of , , and other characters from .\nWhat is the fulcrum in Mr. West's life that led him to realize a talent to shape personalities with his voice, and how did the discovery of that gift shape him? Wikinews reporter found that like many great comedians, West faced more sour early in life than he did sweet. The sour came from a physically and emotionally abusive alcoholic father (\"I could tell you the kind of night I was going to have from the sound of the key in the door or the way the car pulled up.\"), to his own problems with drug and alcohol use (\"There is a point that you can reach in your life where you don\u2019t want to live, but you haven\u2019t made the decision to die.\").\nIf sin, suffering and redemption feel like the stages of an endless cycle of American existence, West's own redemption from his brutalized childhood is what helped shape his gift. He performed little bits to cheer up his cowed mother, ravaged by the fact she could not stop her husband's abuse of young West. \"I was the whipping boy and she would just be reduced to tears a lot of times, and I would come in and say stuff, and I would put out little bits just to pull her out of it.\"\nBut West has also enjoyed the sweet. His career blossomed as his talent for creating entire histories behind fictional characters and creatures simply by exploring nuance in his voice landed him at the top of his craft. You may never again be able to forget that behind the voice of your favorite character, there is often an extraordinary life. \nBelow is 's interview with renowned voice actor Billy West, who for the first time publicly talks about the horrors he faced in his childhood; his misguided search for answers in anger, drugs and alcohol; and the peace he has achieved as one of America's most recognizable voice actors.\nThe use of celebrities for voiceovers.\nDS: What standards are those?\nDS: Like ?\nDS: as well in '?\nDS: What\u2019s the solution? Not to do characters around stars?\nDS: They\u2019ll have you come in, or someone of your caliber come in, and actually shape the voice around the character and then they\u2019ll present it to the celebrity as the template?\nDS: Are you paid for that?\nDS: Are there legal remedies that you could pursue for that?\nDS: There was a similar issue involved with . They had taken a likeness of one of his earlier roles. I think it was Then they tried to pass it off later as him and he sued them for doing that. Are you familiar with that situation?\nDS: He did.\nDS: Has your speaking out on this issue hurt you in any way?\nDS: In your career?\nDS: There\u2019s no reaction against it from the studios or from the \u2026.?\nIconic characters and choosing projects.\nDS: You discussed in an interview issues about the weight of the character\u2019s legacies, such as or . You had said that every time they do one of these they say, 'this time it\u2019s going to be different. We\u2019re putting the teeth back in those characters. Nobody is going to tell us what we can\u2019t write and what we can write.' And you said they always blow it. How do they blow it?\nDS: How do you choose a project, or does the project choose you?\nDS: Where do you think voice acting is going? It doesn\u2019t seem like it\u2019s ever an art that\u2019s going to lose its place, but do you see it diminishing? Is it on a downturn? Is it on an upturn? Is it idling?\nDS: With computer animated voices?\nDiscovering his talent.\nDS: Do you remember a time in your life when you started recognizing your talent for being able to shape your voice into memorable characters?\nDS: You had a talent that seemed very trite to you, but very few other people could do it and you didn't recognize that?\nDS: You would feel a compulsion to do the plays in a voice?\n\"'DS: I\u2019m not a voice actor, but there\u2019s times I\u2019ll hear a person say a phrase. I covered the Iranian president speaking at Colombia for \"Wikinews\" and I watched these dueling ideologues who were normal citizens. One of them was this large black woman with a yelling at this guy. I recorded these voices. She had one of those voices that I just couldn\u2019t get out of my head. She just kept going, \u201cYou\u2019re evil. You\u2019re going to burn in Hell.\u201d I found myself saying it aloud over and over and over again because her voice and what she said made such an impression on me that I wanted to imitate it. There was such a history behind that voice. She probably could have just said, \u201cBuy ,\u201d and I would still be saying it over and over and over again.\n\"It was a horror chamber where I grew up\".\n\"'DS: Is how you developed your talent when you were younger based upon imitating others? You would hear things that would leave impressions on you and you would want to imitate them? But \"why\" would you want to imitate them?\nDS: It was escapism ...?\nDS: So when you would escape into those voices, you felt a sense of safety?\nDS: And things that you could control through your own voice.\nDS: Whereas you couldn\u2019t control what an alcoholic authority figure was going to do.\nDS: What was your dad\u2019s reaction to your doing voices?\nDS: Where was your mom during all this?\nWest moves to Boston after his parents divorce.\nDS: It doesn\u2019t sound like she was very successful.\nDS: When did you come to a realization that your voice was something that you wanted to turn into a career?\nDS: Did you say or ?\nDS: Do you think that\u2019s had any lasting effect on you?\nDS: They say that all great comedians typically have extraordinary tragedy in their lives, and they develop their humor as a response to it.\nDS: Even though you were hurting, it would hurt you to see her hurting over you.\nDS: What made you the whipping boy?\nDS: What would make you the one that he would unleash that upon as opposed to your brothers? \nDS: Like what?\nDS: An issue?\nDS: What is your relationship with your brothers like? Did they see this going on? Did they feel bad for you?\nHow West dealt with his father's abuse.\nDS: You said your father was a victim of abuse himself and that pattern often repeats. How did you stop that pattern? Was it through your voice work?\nDS: How so?\nRehabilitation and sobriety.\nDS: How did you stop the fights and the drugs?\nDS: Are you still ?\nDS: Were you at a point where you didn\u2019t necessarily want to die, but you just didn\u2019t care if you lived?\nDS: Whatever happens happens.\nDS: And that would almost egg you on?\nDS: Now it\u2019s all electronic.\nIs West glad he experienced addiction?\nDS: Are you in some way glad that you went through the drug and alcohol abuse?\nDS: Do you believe in a ?\nDS: Me too.\nDS: I didn\u2019t know the mass in Latin, but I was an altar boy and I had Catholicism shoved down my face, but I\u2019m 33, so had happened.\nDS: The priest at my church got a nun pregnant and my mother, who was the president of the at my Catholic grade school, helped deliver the baby and keep the whole thing hidden.\nDS: Yeah. And he\u2019s still the priest.\nWest on his career.\nDS: Where do you see yourself now in your career?\nDS: At what point was that for you?\nWest on politics.\n[\"continued from previous section\"]\nDS: Well they are. It\u2019s just things have changed.\nDS: Who are you talking about?\nDS: Yeah.\n\"'DS: It\u2019s confusing because you look at somebody like Dick Cheney, who has this lesbian daughter, who\u2019s in a gay marriage [\"Poe and Cheney have not entered into a formal union\" - \"ed\"] and now has a baby with , and you just don\u2019t know how the situation exists. It\u2019s hard to comprehend. That exists in the Republican party, and that she seems to be fine with that existence and even works for it. \nBilly West on modern American society.\nDS: Has the Iraq War affected you much as a person?\nDS: Teach the controversy. Make it appear there are two sides to every fact.\nDS: Do you think we live in a fear-based society now?\nDS: What is the reasoning behind questions like, 'Aren\u2019t you afraid of saying such-and-such thing?'\nDS: Are you optimistic?\nDS: And you think that they are equal?\nDS: You\u2019re saying in today\u2019s culture they are equal?\nDS: I don\u2019t have cable, so I know how you feel.\nDS: It\u2019s amazing when you hear the BBC interview British politicians. We find it shocking that they\u2019ll say things like \u201cAren\u2019t you essentially lying when you say that?\u201d\n\"'DS: That's an argument on Wikipedia: people make the argument, 'let's present the information out there and \"let the reader decide.\"\nDS: Exactly,and it can be difficult to decide what to believe when reasonable minds can differ, but I think it's very problematic to ever argue \"just let the reader decide.\" I don't know if Wikipedia is the place for that fight, but in the news media, that is the place for the fight. I interviewed Gay Talese, who quoted Norman Mailer who said the media is like a donkey, and you must feed the donkey every day; the donkey will eat anything: garbage, tin cans, slop. And report on whatever they are fed.\nBilly West on telling it like it is.\nDS: Are your voices an attempt to understand reality?\nDS: No you are. \nDS: Well it\u2019s good.\nDS: That's perfect. I will send you a link to the interview when it is published.\nDS: It doesn\u2019t say anything negative about the Stern show. It just mentions the characters that you did and that you were on there. And the only thing it says is that \u201cBilly has since claimed that he left the Stern show because WXRK management refused to give him a sufficient pay raise.\u201d\nDS: There\u2019s a link to your official web site on there. And there\u2019s also a link to Voicechasers database and a link to Internet Movie database and a link to an interview with you on CNBC."}

She rose to fame after winning Cycle 8 of \"America's Next Top Model\", and since then, has been aggressively tapping into the fashion industry. As a result of her Latin background, Gonzalez has been successful at marketing herself both in the English-speaking and Spanish-speaking worlds. However, Gonzalez is much much more \u2013 a fighter, a humanitarian, and a good Latin granddaughter. \nBorn in Chicago to a Latina mother, and a Puerto Rican-born father, Gonzalez had, in many ways, a typical U.S. Latino experience \u2013 her tight knit family, grandparents, and spirituality played an intrinsic part in her upbringing. \n\"I went to an all-girl Catholic school and grew up with tons of family...My family was very close knit and supportive. They were involved in my life everyday. So there was so much joy in every little occasion...Every Sunday we would go to my grandmother's house where we [the family] would hang out together...We enjoyed being around each other and being together,\" states Gonzalez. \nHer grandfather was the director of a local dance group, Viva La Gente, which Gonzalez credits with impacting her life positively. \n\"I was a dancer for 12 years and life revolved around dancing. I was a very active girl, and was always involved with my grandfather's dance studio. The whole family was. My aunts, my cousins \u2013 everyone took part in performances and were involved in the group...That's how we spent our summers, and we looked forward to being outside, dancing salsa, hip hop, merengue,\" states Gonzalez. Through her involvement in the dance studio, Gonzalez's horizon was broadened significantly, and her humanitarian streak began to deepen. \n\"We were always constantly traveling. We traveled to Mexico to poor villages where we gave performances to give back to the community,\" said Gonzalez. \nIronically, ANTM gave her the opportunity to overcome her own difficulties and to further help those in need. \"I went in there, without knowing that I was in an abusive relationship. They were the ones that brought that up to me...they felt I was emotionally destroyed, they wanted me to get support,\" commented Gonzalez. While the ANTM staff was supportive, she also credits her life long dream for helping her get out of the abusive relationship. \n\"Having a dream and having a goal in life, is the most important thing I did in my life. Because of that I maneuvered my way to that dream. I knew I was better than that, I wanted to be happier,\u201d stated Gonzalez. \nSoon after winning ANTM, Gonzalez became a spokesperson for Liz Claiborne and the National Domestic Violence Hotline, and began traveling the country reaching out to women. \n\"We had several meetings, and they asked me to be a spokesperson. I was so happy and blessed to help women, to have that title. It's something I want to do, besides modelling...I enjoy sharing my personal experiences because I can educate them, but I can also save someone's life. It's something precious, it's a gift,\" stated Gonzalez. \nAbuse is not the only obstacle Jaslene has had to face. Growing up Latina had its own set of difficulties. \"Being a minority is a challenge no matter what,\" states Gonzalez. \nHowever, Gonzalez also states that being a Latina has many positive aspects in regards to her profession. \"As a Latina, you have the advantage of being a Latina. Not only do you have this corporate job, but you can relate to many groups as a person.\"\nWhen asked if the fashion industry forces Latina models to change certain aspects about themselves, she remarks that she focuses on always staying true to herself. \"Modeling is a difficult job because of what you go through. 80% of the time it's a no...When I go in, I go in like me, I don't have to change anything. Any time I get a chance to show who I am, I do. I am a Spanish girl, trying to pursue my dreams. I try to be the best I can be,\" remarked Gonzalez. \nIt is that same confidence and will to succeed that she seems to appreciate in other woman. \"I find women beautiful. I find a girl with no makeup, not worrying about her style and appearance, I find that sexy. I find confidence beautiful...Its so simple. It's being natural and confident,\" said Gonzalez. \nAs a role model, she has two key pieces advice that she offers women: nurture your mind with positive thoughts, and identify and foster the principles in life you value. \nIt is not surprising to see why Gonzalez's family is proud of her. \"My family is so funny. They are so happy. I've never seen them so full of life. My mom acts like she won. My grandmother screams 'mi flaca' every time she sees me. They are so proud. Especially my grandparents. I was practically raised by them. To see them see you so happy and successful, there couldn't be a better feeling,\" said Gonzalez. \nShe adds that her grandparents would be extremely happy if she appeared on \"Cristina\", the Spanish-language talk show whose host is referred to as \"the Spanish Oprah Winfrey.\"\nIn the coming years, Gonzalez plans to continue on the path she is on. She wants to continue gracing magazine covers, as well as dedicating herself to helping young teens develop self growth and esteem. \"Every time I wake up, God gives me the opportunity to be a better me...Life gets better as it goes by.\"\n\"This is the third in a series of articles with\" America's Next Top Model \"contestants.\""}

Writers can go back to work,\" Verrone said.\nNearly 3800 members of the guild, both the east and west coast unions cast their ballots in New York City and Los Angeles, with more than 92 percent voting to end the strike. The writers will be back to work today and new episodes of televisions series should come as early as four to six weeks.\nThe strike occurred over the streaming of television, movies and other creative work over the Internet and how writers should be paid for that content. Under a tentative agreement, the writers would get a maximum flat fee of $1,200 per program in the first two years, then two percent of a distributor's gross revenue in the third year.\nThe strike ended after entertainment company heads including, Leslie Moonves, the CEO of CBS, Peter Chernin, the president of News Corporation and Robert A. Iger, the CEO of The Walt Disney Company and union officials such as Verrone and executive director David Young worked out a deal.\nMoonves said the deal was a fair one, according to the Associated Press. When speaking to the entertainment publication Variety, he said, \"I think there was some miscommunication early on. It was important that we started speaking eye to eye. Ultimately, getting the percentage of streaming revenue was important to (WGA), and I understand it.\"\nThe end to the strike means Hollywood's annual celebration, the Academy Awards, can go ahead as scheduled, February 24. The threat of picketing writers had reduced the Golden Globes last month to a news conference. Sid Ganis, the president of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences and the executive producer of this year's 80th Academy Awards, Gil Cates, will hold a news conference today to reveal their plans for the award show since there will not a be picket line in front of the Kodak Theatre where the award show will be held.\nThe strike stopped production of dozens of television shows and slowed production on movies. One Los Angeles economist says it cost the local economy at least $3 billion. However, the city of Los Angeles believed losses to only be around $380 million."}

The agency which monitors Scientology in Germany is called the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution, and has had the Church of Scientology under surveillance in Germany since 1997. \nThe ruling stated: \"There are concrete indications that Scientology's activities are to implement Scientology's program in Germany and to expand more and more Scientology's principles in government, economy and society\". The court did not rule on whether or not the organization should be considered a religion, saying that was irrelevant to the ruling. The German government considers Scientology a business, and not a religion. \nThe court cited \"numerous indications\" that \"central constitutional values such as the dignity of mankind and the right to equal treatment would be suspended or restricted,\" in a Scientology society. The statement released along with the court's decision also said that \"In particular, there is the suspicion that in a scientological society only Scientologists would enjoy civil rights\". \nDuring the court proceedings the German court heard testimony concerning anti-democratic statements made by L. Ron Hubbard, the American founder of Scientology who died in 1986. The court did not find any evidence that the organization had distanced itself from Hubbard's statements. Certain statements made by Hubbard detail how to harass ex-members and critics of Scientology. Scientologists presented other writings by Hubbard, and asserted that he was a peaceful person and was being quoted out of context. \nOther evidence considered by the court included \"The Way to Happiness\" brochures, part of the organization's campaign to disseminate Scientology principles worldwide. The project is called \"Operation Planetary Calm\". A brochure was sent to the office of German Interior Minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, whose office monitors Scientology and other groups deemed a threat to Germany's constitution.\nWhen the Church of Scientology opened new headquarters in Berlin in January, opponents of Scientology protested outside the building and accused the organization of brainwashing its members. In December, Germany's top security officials stated that they believe Scientology is in violation of the German constitution, and requested state officials to investigate whether they have sufficient information to ban the organization in Germany.\nScientology spokeswoman Sabine Weber said that the organization will appeal the ruling. Karin Pouw, public affairs director for the Church of Scientology International told the \"Associated Press\": \"Despite over 10 years of intrusive investigation and harassment of Scientologists, not one shred of evidence has been uncovered to justify this politically motivated investigation\". A statement released by the Church of Scientology in Germany said: \"The German Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution should finally end this farce and turn its attention to real enemies of the Constitution and real danger so as to do what it is there for: to protect the German constitution and the basic rights of the people\". \nThe Church of Scientology took German authorities to court in March 2003, seeking to stop further surveillance of their organization. In a November 2004 ruling, a court in Cologne upheld the legality of the German government's surveillance of the Church of Scientology.\nThe United States Department of State has criticized Germany for its surveillance of Scientology in its annual Human Rights Report."}

NIU officials said the shooter was enrolled at the university as late as the spring semester of 2007, and was now a student at the University of Illinois in Urbana-Champaign.\nMany of the victims were taken to local hospitals. Kishwaukee Community Hospital reported a total of 18 patients brought to the hospital. Of the 18, only two were admitted. Eight of the patients were discharged later in the day, while seven were transferred to other regional hospitals for treatment. One victim died at Kishwaukee Hospital, another died after being transferred to St. Anthony's Hospital in Rockford, while the other four fatalities were confirmed at the scene.\nNews about the shooting emerged at 3:20 p.m. CST, when a special campus notice was posted on the university's website, indicating the presence of a gunman on campus. Twenty minutes later, NIU announced the cancellation of all classes for the remainder of the evening, and ten minutes after that announcement, NIU officials confirmed there had been a shooting and that emergency personnel were handling the situation.\n\"The ambulance took away two students on the ground right outside my dorm,\" Dominique Broxton, a student at NIU, told the \"Chicago Tribune\". \"I don't know them. They looked bloody. Where I am right now, there are a lot of police, at least a dozen. There are police cars and trucks everywhere.\" George Gaynor, a student in the lecture hall when the shooting occurred, added that the shooter looked like \"a skinny white guy with a stocking cap on.\"\nThe DeKalb County coroner has released the names of all those killed in the attack. In addition to the shooter, those killed included Daniel Parmenter, 20; Catalina Garcia, 20; Ryanne Mace, 19; Julianna Gehant, 32, and Gayle Dubowski, 20. All were students at NIU. Chicago news outlets are also reporting names of four of the surviving victims:\nRahman was transferred to Good Samaritan Hospital in Downers Grove with shotgun wounds to both arms and the side of her face. The other three remain at Kishwaukee Community Hospital.\nNIU president John Peters released some details about the shooter during a press conference following the shooting. Kazmierczak had been a student at NIU but transferred to the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign for the current academic year. He was pursuing a graduate degree in sociology, with an emphasis in peace and social justice. Kazmierczak won a Dean's Award for a project in 2006, and was active in the student government while at NIU. Officials at a press conference also indicated that Kazmierczak was taking medication for an unspecified condition, and discontinued use of that medication approximately two weeks prior to the shooting.\nThe campus of Northern Illinois University is closed until further notice, and officials have announced the cancellation of all athletic events, home and away, through at least Sunday, February 17."}

Since launch, the satellite's orbit has decayed and it is approaching the point at which it will re-enter the atmosphere and potentially fall to Earth. The missile will be used as a kinetic anti-satellite weapon (ASAT), and will destroy the satellite through hitting it at high speed.\nThe satellite potentially has hazardous materials on board, including hydrazine. Ordinarily, the hydrazine would be used as fuel, but since the satellite failed immediately after launch, this was never used. It is expected that about half of the satellite would be capable of surviving re-entry, potentially including the fuel tank. Since hydrazine is toxic, the satellite could pose a severe danger if it hits in a populated area, however it has been considered likely that the tank would probably rupture and explode during re-entry. Destroying the satellite on the grounds of safety is the stated purpose of shooting down the satellite. Officials have denied claims that it is to prevent secrets that the satellite is carrying from falling into the wrong hands, or that it is a demonstration in response to a Chinese ASAT test in January 2007.\nThe missile which will be used to shoot down the satellite will be a Standard Missile 3 (SM-3), which will be launched from the USS Lake Erie in the North Pacific Ocean. The missile, which was designed to shoot down other missiles, will be modified slightly in order to allow it to recognise USA-193 as its target. \nIf the attack is successful, the satellite will be broken into many small pieces. This will eliminate the hazard from the hydrazine and break into small enough pieces that nothing will survive reentry. Officials reported that the likelihood of success was \"high\". NASA Administrator Michael Griffin said that it was impossible to make the situation any worse. Missing the satellite would change nothing, while a slight blow would still result in the satellite returning to Earth, and a direct hit would destroy the satellite. It is believed that the missile will be aimed directly at the satellite's fuel tank.\nWhile the debris will not pass near enough to the International Space Station to cause disruption, it is not clear whether it could affect spacecraft passing through the lower orbit in which USA-193 currently resides. For this reason, the satellite will not be destroyed until the Space Shuttle \"Atlantis\", which is currently conducting mission STS-122, has landed. The debris caused by the satellite's destruction is expected to re-enter the atmosphere within a few weeks."}

San Antonio Archbishop Jose Gomez criticized the school for not consulting with him before offering the invitation. He stated that the candidate's pro-choice position on abortion contradicts the religion's rejection of the practice and added that her \"positions against the teachings of the church and life issues\" should deem her ineligible for a campaign visit. The University is privately owned and separate from the Catholic Church on decision-making authority. It stated in an official press release that the University does not endorse candidates and that it understood the ideological differences between Senator Clinton and the Catholic Church. Despite this, Archbishop Gomez believed the event involved him since it occurred in his archdiocese, and wondered why Senator Clinton decided to hold a rally at a Catholic University. \nClinton's main strength in past primaries and caucuses have been among Latino voters who have propelled her to victories in California, Nevada and Florida. Most Latinos are Roman Catholic, which might explain Clinton's visit to the University in conjunction with the upcoming March 4 Texas Primary."}

Freemasons, Nelly, NERD and David Guetta to a group of 250 children. An equally-sized group watched the concert performances of the same songs. After seeing the videos the girls in the test group felt more strongly that outward appearance was important for girls, and they tended to be less satisfied about their own appearances. Unexpectedly the videos did not affect the boys in the groups as much, their behaviour and self-image was more or less unchanged, contrary to previous beliefs that boys can be influenced by sexy videos to participate in group rapes.\nTom ter Bogt was instated today as professor at the University of Utrecht in pop music and youth culture. \"There is no reason for a moral panic,\" Ter Bogt says, \"young people need to experiment with sex. But these experiments must be based on equality between men and women, and the relationships in these videos are not based on equality. The clips undermine the self-image of young girls. When they start to define their identity with their looks, they may lose self-confidence, will perform worse in school, and will suffer more from eating disorders.\"\nThe conclusions of Ter Bogt are confirmed by research by US psychologists, but also shows that parents have a major influence in their girls' self-image.

Patches was created at NBC-affiliate WTCN by Daryl Laub. When he left for KSTP-TV, also in Minnesota, the character was taken over by Wedes. (Wedes was then an actor, DJ, and kids TV cook.) In 1958, Wedes moved to Seattle, to become the first floor director at KIRO-TV, bringing \"The J.P. Patches Show\" with him. (Laub, meanwhile, created T. N. Tatters at another station.) The show aired twice a day for 13 years, and once on Saturdays, for 8 more years just in the morning, and for the final two years only on Saturday morning. In total, an estimated 12,000 shows made the air, all of them live, with next to no budget.\nWedes told the \"Everett Herald\" that: \"I'm still amazed at the longevity of the character. When I go on appearances, I get hugs, I get tears, I get laughter. The people are so in love with J.P. Patches. I can't believe it that it has hung on that long.\"\nBusinesses paid Wedes and the station to appear in character at grand openings, appeared at a Boeing Christmas party with an audience of 55,000, and appeared on Darigold milk containers, Sunbeam bread bags, and Dankens ice cream lids. Even still, the image has been licensed for bobble heads and an action figure. The book \"J.P. Patches: Northwest Icon\" was published in 2002.\nWhile the cartoons were airing, Wedes' Patches would greet guest children; the waiting list was for a while six months long. Children who stopped by include now-billionaire Bill Gates, and former Washington Governor Gary Locke.\nCelebrities appearing on the show included politicians, Olympic medalists, comedian Steve Allen, Burt \"Robin\" Ward of \"Batman\", folk singer Tiny Tim, actress Debbie Reynolds, oceanographer Jacques Cousteau, and Colonel Harland Sanders, the founder of Kentucky Fried Chicken.\nSome parents objected to KIRO-TV dropping the national series \"Captain Kangaroo\", three years into its run, to put in \"Patches\".\nA minor controversy erupted when a local newspaper photographed Wedes, being taken in an ambulance when involved in a car crash, not of his own fault. The official site reads that \"The picture distressed many local children and would remain an embarrassment to the local media if they actually had any shame.\"\nThere are still enough \"Patches Pals\", fans of the show, that a statue is planned for Seattle's Fremont neighborhood. To be completed this summer, the fundraiser is just $55,000 away from the $165,000 needed for the sculpture of Patches with Gertrude, the character's girlfriend.\nThey've so far donated $110,000 of $165,000 to cast a bronze statue of J.P. Patches and his sidekick Gertrude to be placed in the Fremont neighborhood of Seattle. More money is still needed for the statue, being made by a Sultan sculptor and completed this summer. Any money raised that isn't needed for the statue, coordinated by the local chapter of the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences, goes to the Children's Hospital and Regional Medical Center in Seattle; the statue itself will have a slot to collect money for the hospital. Billboards around the region track the fundraising progress.\nWedes was diagnosed in October with a controllable but incurable blood cancer, \"acute myeloma\". He had to avoid public appearance until recently, due to the told of dialysis. He made seven county fair appearances in 2007, and 30 other gigs. Newman often joins him to perform, despite have multiple sclerosis for the past 20 years.\nThe two will appear in \"An Evening With JP Patches &amp; Gertrude: The Men Behind The Makeup\", April 5 at The 7th Street Theatre in Hoquiam."}

One student who escaped unharmed told reporters his life has changed as a result of what he experienced.\n\"I am going to be in class from now on, looking over my shoulder, because if he would have come through the back door, I would not be here right now. I would have been dead,\" he said.\nPolice say the gunman was Steven Kazmierczak, 27, a former graduate student in Sociology at the school. Police say he purchased the shotgun and two of the handguns on Saturday, indicating he may have planned the attack in advance, but authorities have not determined a motive for the shooting.\nKazmierczak had no criminal record but had been a patient for a year at Thresholds-Mary Hill House, a psychiatric treatment center for teens. Under Illinois state law he would not have been able to purchase a weapon legally if there had been a record of arrests or mental problems, but police said he had stopped taking an unspecified medication recently and his behavior had become erratic. \nKazmierczak received a Dean's Award from the university's Sociology Department in 2006. He served as a member of the school's Academic Criminal Justice Association and was considered a good student, but he was not enrolled this semester.\nThursday, police arrived on the scene of the shooting within two minutes, but they were too late. Witnesses say the gunman fired multiple shots in a matter of seconds, reloaded, fired some more and then took his own life. \nIn Washington Friday, President Bush reacted to the shooting. \"This morning I spoke to the President of Northern Illinois University,\" said Mr. Bush. \"I told the President that a lot of folks today will be praying for the families of the victims and for the Northern Illinois University community. Obviously a tragic situation on that campus, and I ask our fellow citizens to offer their blessings, blessings of comfort and blessings of strength.\"\nThis is the latest in a string of shootings at U.S. schools in recent years, the worst being the shooting at Virginia Tech University in Blacksburg, Virginia 10 months ago that left 32 students and teachers dead.

Romney will hand McCain the 280 delegates he won while participating in primaries and caucuses during his campaign. \nThe endorsement from the 83-year-old former president and father of current President Bush ends his official neutrality on the 2008 presidential race.

This new work suggests that at certain concentrations a fraction of the hydronium ions can in fact pair up. \nGregory A. Voth and Sergei Izvekov of the University of Utah, in collaboration with Feng Wang of Boston University, were examining the structure of highly acidic solutions (pH 0 to 1) of hydrochloric acid using sophisticated computer modeling. It is known that in water such acids dissociate into positive ions (cations) and negative ions (anions), with the H+ part solvated by water molecules to form cations such as hydronium (H3O+). It might be expected that positive ions such as these would repel one another, but it turns out that some of these cations unexpectedly associate into pairs at acid concentrations of 0.43 - 0.85 M . The pairing disappears at even higher concentrations where larger aggregates of cations and anions instead begin to form. The authors note that \"cation pairs are stabilized by a nonclassical charge delocalization of the excess proton charge defects over multiple water molecules\". They explain the phenomenon in terms of the amphiphilic nature of the hydronium ion discovered in their 2004 work.\nRecent work by Wallace \"et al.\" indicated the presence of hydronium ion pairs in crystals, but this is the first time such an association has been predicted for an aqueous solution."}

Heesters is, at age 104, the oldest performing artist in the world. Despite his advanced age, he is still active in Germany and Austria both on stage and television.\nHeesters has been controversial since he moved to Germany in the 1930s. He continued to perform in Nazi Germany during the Second World War, and was accused of paying a visit to perform at the Dachau concentration camp. Nazi leader Adolf Hitler attended his shows more than once.\nHostile attitudes toward Heesters did not ebb after the end of the war. In 1963 he was cast in a Dutch production of \"The Sound of Music\" as Captain von Trapp, but the Dutch audience boycotted the show. He went back to Germany, but is still a Dutch citizen.\nHeesters' biggest wish was to perform in Amersfoort once again. His past is however not forgotten, and there will be organised protest actions against Heesters in Amersfoort before, during and after his show. For security reasons the Amersfoort police will check visitors to the concert for dubious objects. \nHein van Kasbergen, spokesman for the committee \"Heesters Raus\" (\"Heesters, get out!\" in German) says: \"Heesters is like the inventor of the A-bomb: he has blood on his hands and with his shows he has extended the war.\". \"He kept singing for the Nazi regime, for the Wehrmacht, and he earned millions,\" said Piet Schouten, another representative of the committee. \"We have a problem with that on behalf of all the victims.\".\nAccording to researcher David Barnouw of Dutch Institute for War Documentation, Heesters was not a major war criminal, and there is no proof that he performed in the Dachau camp. \"It is nonsense to suggest that there was a warm relationship between Heesters and Adolf Hitler,\" says Barnouw."}

Bush said the World Trade Organization is willing to help Benin's economy, but he also suggested exporting more cotton-based products in addition to raw cotton.\nBush said the United States will help facilitate a peacekeeping force in Darfur, but will not send troops to the region. \"I made the decision not to [send troops], upon the recommendation of a lot of the groups involved in Darfur, as well as other folks ... once you make that decision, then there's not many other avenues except for the United Nations and the peacekeeping forces.\"\nWhen asked about the situation in Kenya, Bush said he has sent Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice to visit the country on Monday to support former UN Secretary General Kofi Annan in mediating the conflict. \"Kenya is an issue ... and that's why I'm sending Secretary Rice there to help the Kofi Annan initiative - all aimed at having a clear message that there be no violence and that there ought to be a power-sharing agreement,\" said Bush. \nWhite House national security adviser Stephen Hadley said Rice's visit will only last a few hours. \"It's basically to go in, give some impetus, but then step out and let Kofi Annan continue his diplomacy,\" he said. At a press briefing aboard , one reporter questioned what could be accomplished in a few hours and asked why the President didn't go to Kenya instead. Ambassador Jendayi Frazer answered with, \"Secretary Rice's engagement on Kenya has been much longer than a few hours.

And so she's been very much engaged over the last three or four months on dealing with electoral crisis.\"\n\"The purpose of her going is to back Kofi's mediation, it's not to take over that mediation,\" Frazer continued. \"President Bush does not need to go to Kenya at this point. At the right moment in time, the President will engage, but right now it's occurring in a very systematic way to back Annan's mediation, not to try to supplant Annan's mediation.\"\nAfter spending three hours in Benin, Bush flew to Tanzania, where he will stay for three nights.

Prime Minister Hashim Tha\u00e7i declared that Kosovo would become a democratic country and would respect the rights of all its communities. It is expected that several countries, including the United Kingdom, the United States and most members of the European Union, will recognise its independence on Monday. Serbia and Russia are against an independent Kosovo. Approximately 10% of Kosovars are of Serbian descent, the majority is Albanian.\nThe declaration was passed unanimously by the Kosovar parliament, who subsequently signed it. The Prime Minister told MPs that \"We have waited for this day for a very long time\", and that \"the independence of Kosovo marks the end of the dissolution of the former Yugoslavia\". He also said that Kosovo would be working to follow the plan drawn up by former Finnish president Martti Ahtisaari, and the United Nations. MPs have also selected a new flag (pictured on the right), showing the shape of the country in gold, on a blue background, with six white stars.\nThe Serbian Prime Minister, Vojislav Kostunica said that the declaration made Kosovo a \"false state\". Serbian Foreign Minister Vuk Jeremic had this to say about the declaration: \nHe had previously said that if Kosovo were to declare independence, \"we shall undertake all diplomatic, political and economic measures designed to impede and reverse this direct and unprovoked attack on our sovereignty.\"\n&lt;br clear=\"left\"&gt;\nInternational reaction.\nThe British Foreign Office said that the declaration was \"an important development which creates a new context for Kosovo status\", and U.S. President George W. Bush said that he \"strongly supported the Ahtisaari plan\", which had resulted in the declaration.\nJavier Solana, the European Union's co-ordinator of foreign policy said that \"stability in Kosovo as well as of the whole Balkan region is essential\", and that he is \"convinced that the Kosovar leaders will be up to their responsibilities in this crucial moment\". French foreign minister Bernard Kouchner said that he wished Kosovo good luck.\nThe Russian Foreign Ministry, however, said that they expected UN and NATO peacekeeping forces to \"out their mandate\" and take \"tough administrative measures\" against the declaration. The President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, has criticised European states that are backing the declaration by pointing out that other separatist groups like Basques in Spain and Turks in Northern Cyprus are not granted the same support. He has said that supporting Kosovo's announcement \"\u201c...is not moral or legal\u201d\".\nThe Netherlands minister of Foreign Affairs, Maxime Verhagen, said that he wanted to study the constitution and the declaration of independence before supporting the new nation. Belgium Foreign Minister Karel De Gucht also welcomed the Ahtisaari to secure safety and stability in the region."}

Under the Treaty of Perpetual Peace agreed in 1502 by the English King Henry VII and the Scottish King James IV, Berwick was declared to be \"of the Kingdom of England but not in it\". This resulted in Berwick having to be named individually in legislation until the British Parliament passed the Wales and Berwick Act in 1746 which stated that unless specially specified otherwise, the term \"England\" in laws included Berwick and Wales; in 1853 the declaration of war on Russia specifically mentioned Berwick, but the 1856 Treaty of Paris did not, leading to the urban legend that the town was still at war with Russia until the Mayor signed a peace treaty with a Soviet diplomat in 1966.\nSince the creation of the Scottish Parliament in 1999, Berwickers have noted that Scottish residents receive about \u00a31500 more government expenditure each year than English residents, including free care for elderly people and free university tuition, both of which have to be paid for in England. \nThe town already has a strong Scottish influence - famously both its football team and rugby team play in the Scottish leagues, a minority of the town's banks are Scottish, and the Church of Scotland has a large congregation in the town. \nA poll conducted for the ITV television programme, \"Tonight\", to be broadcast on February 18 has shown that 60% (1,182 for, 775 against) of those polled would prefer the town to be in Scotland, while a poll for \"The Berwick Advertiser\" newspaper showed 78% in favour. This has resulted in a motion being proposed by Scottish National Party MSP Christine Grahame, calling on the Scottish Government to negotiate for Berwick's \"restoration\" to Scotland. A spokesman for Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond said \"The Scottish Government has no territorial demands on our friends in England. But it's clear most people in Berwick would rather be part of SNP-governed Scotland than Labour-run England.\" "}

Around 50 people came to hear about the organisation's evolution during 2007 and what's coming up for 2008. A book about citizen journalism, with contributions from both mainstream journalists and several alternative media experts, was also presented. And the Indymedians mingled, with loungy Creative Commons music in the background.\nIndymedia.be was founded in 2000, only a few months after Indymedia's inception at the alter-globalist protests at the World Trade Organisation's summit in Seattle. This made them the first Indymedia on the European mainland. The \"Independent Media Center\"'s trademark is politically left, social reporting. The initial growth was slow, but during 2007, the organisation grew to around 110 regular contributors, with the first steps towards regional groups in Brussels and Antwerp. The public today could also visit the brand new media centre with new equipment. And although readership has increased exponentially to around 7000 visitors per day (and with it, server costs), finances have not, leading to a fund raising campaign.\nSeveral projects during 2007 aimed to increase the quality of the articles; research projects such as those on the Belgian elections and formation crisis centred on social issues, where the mainstream media itself recognised that the political debate was often monotonous and lacking content.\nNevertheless, bringing analysis and background will continue a challenge during 2008. During the photographer's workshop, the possibilities for photo documentary and photo-based interviews vs. simple photo reporting were illustrated as an alternative to bringing \"just a bunch of pictures from another street protest.\"\nAs a central player in the field of alternative media in Belgium, Indymedia also wants to stir the debate about participatory journalism. This has led to their first 'media reader' about the topic, and the creators hope more versions will follow.\nParticipation: a key concept for the 'new' media.\nThe author of the book's introduction, Nico Carpentier, gave a lecture on participatory journalism and the challenges facing organisations like Indymedia. Carpentier is a researcher who teaches media studies at the Free University of Brussels, and has co-authored the book \"Understanding Alternative Media\" (Open University Press, 2007).\nCarpentier started his talk by putting citizen journalism in its web 2.0 context to explain some common critiques. He referred to the central position of the individual, who can use blogs to disseminate any personal thought, as 'net narcissism'. Symptomatic of this trend is the shift from the classic media 'organisation' to 'communities' of citizen journalists, noted Carpentier.\nHe also warned against a reductionist view of 'participation', and used YouTube to illustrate the lack of influence, shared ownership and responsibility contributors have in the dominant model of so-called participation -instead of creating media together, participation becomes 'posting something'.\nHe systematically used the term \"participatory journalism\", because he feels the term \"citizen journalism\" is loaded with the problematic image of the amateur journalist, and the idea that 'Every Citizen is a Reporter'. Journalist Walter Zinzen argues fiercly in Indymedia's new book against would-be journalists who lack the skills that take traditional journalists years of training and experience.\nCarpentier elaborated on the pitfalls for participatory journalism initiatives. Such as the balance between participation and efficacy; or how the horizontal structure tends to slow down journalistic 'communities', and more so the larger they get. There is also the general lack of interest in a two-way communication system about the news, in a world where media products are consumer goods. And of course, continuous financial and organisational problems. Carpentier explained how working in the alternative media is rarely a life-threatening hobby in the Western world, but that a lack of government support is still a logical consequence of being a forum for criticism. Some alternative media manage to find alternative funding, while others have to adapt to meet government targets or are taken over by corporations.\nCarpentier concluded his lecture calling for more a network of alternative media which could foster collaboration with the mainstream media, based on mutual respect."}

The move follows an investigation by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) into allegations of animal cruelty and mishandling of cattle destined for the human food chain.\nThe USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) had determined that beef products produced by the Chino, California company were unfit for human consumption as the cattle had not received \"complete and proper inspection.\"\nThe recall has been designated as Class II, which the USDA describes as \"a health hazard situation where there is a remote probability of adverse health consequences from the use of the product.\"\nOn Friday, Secretary of Agriculture Ed Schafer indicated that charges had been laid against employees of the plant alleged to have taken part in the mistreatment of cattle. \"Today [Friday], the San Bernardino District Attorney filed felony animal cruelty charges against two employees who were terminated by Hallmark/Westland Meat Packing Company,\" said Schafer. \"It is regrettable that these animals were mistreated and I am encouraged and supportive of these actions by the San Bernardino District Attorney in response to this mistreatment.\"\nThe USDA learned of the possible inhumane handling of non-ambulatory (disabled) cattle at the packing plant on January 30 and has since suspended activities at the plant. \"We continue to conduct a thorough investigation into whether any violations of food safety or additional humane handling regulations have occurred,\" said Secretary Schafer in a press release. \"On February 8, our Office of the Inspector General took the lead on the investigation. At that time, USDA extended the administrative hold on Hallmark/Westland Meat Packing Company products for the National School Lunch Program, the Emergency Food Assistance Program and the Food Distribution Program on Indian Reservations while the investigation continues,\" said Schafer.\nThe FSIS reported that Hallmark/Westland had not contacted the FSIS public health veterinarian, as required, when cattle became ill or disabled after undergoing ante-mortem (slaughter) inspection, putting the company out of compliance with FSIS regulations. \"Because the cattle did not receive complete and proper inspection FSIS has determined them to be unfit for human food and the company is conducting a recall,\" explained Secretary Schafer. \nThe cruelty charges stem from an undercover video that reportedly showed sick cattle being moved by crews using forklifts.\n\"Words cannot accurately express how shocked and horrified I was at the depictions contained on the video that was taken by an individual who worked at our facility from October 3 thru November 14, 2007,\" said Steve Mendell, President, Westland Meat Co. and Hallmark Meat Packing. \"We have taken swift action regarding the two employees identified on the video and have already implemented aggressive measures to ensure all employees follow our humane handling policies and procedures. We are also cooperating with the USDA investigators on the allegations of inhumane handling treatment which is a serious breech of our company\u2019s policies and training.\"\nThe USDA stressed that it is \"extremely unlikely\" that the cattle involved were at risk for Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) or mad-cow disease due to the employment of multiple safeguards. The USDA felt the recall was required, however, as the plant had allegedly violated USDA regulations.\nThe recall involves raw and frozen beef products produced on various dates from February 1, 2006 to February 2, 2008. For further information about the recall, consumers, media, and distributors are encouraged to contact Hallmark/Westland's Plant Manager Stan Mendell or Food Safety Consultant Steve Sayer at (909) 590-3340 or the FSIS website, www.fsis.usda.gov."}

He broke Kyle Korver's Rookie Challenge record of seven three-pointers, set in 2005. This was the sixth straight victory for the Sophomores.\nHaier Shooting Stars Competition.\nTeam San Antonio won this shooting competition featuring current and former NBA stars, as well as WNBA players. Team San Antonio, which consisted of Spurs forward Tim Duncan, former Spurs center David Robinson, and Silver Stars guard Becky Hammon, defeated Team Chicago in the finals on a halfcourt shot by Duncan.\nPlaystation Skills Challenge.\nDeron Williams passed, shot, and dribbled his way through the obstacle course to win the Playstation Skills Challenge with a record time of 25.5 seconds in the final round. Chris Paul's time of 31.2 seconds was strong, but no match for Williams' performance. Dwyane Wade, who had won the challenge for the past two years in a row, struggled through the first round with a time of 53.9 seconds. Also eliminated in the first round was Jason Kidd, who finished the course in 39.7 seconds.\nFoot Locker Three-Point Shootout.\nToronto Raptors guard Jason Kapono won the shootout for the second year in row, making him the first back-to-back winner since Peja Stojakovic won in 2002 and 2003. Kapono's final round score of 25 tied the record set by Mark Price and Craig Hodges in the 1986 competition. Also in the final round were Daniel Gibson, who scored 17 points in the final round, and Dirk Nowitzki, the 2006 Shootout champion, who scored 14. Eliminated in the first round were Stojakovic, Richard Hamilton, and Steve Nash.\nSprite Slam Dunk Contest.\n\"I don't think people want to see the same old dunks. They want to see something else, see some spice.\" \nThese were Dwight Howard's words after winning the Slam Dunk Contest on Saturday. In the first year where fans were able to vote for the winner through text messaging and the Internet, Howard received 78% of the vote, beating out Gerald Green for the slam dunk trophy.\nIn one of the more notable dunks of the contest, Howard donned a Superman costume, complete with a red cape. He then took off from just inside the free throw line and threw the ball down without even touching the rim. In Howard's first dunk of the night, he tossed the ball off the reverse side of the backboard, caught it, and dunked left-handed.\nGerald Green impressed the fans and the judges when his teammate Rashad McCants placed a cupcake with a lit candle on the back of the rim; Green then jumped up, blew out the candle, and threw down a left handed dunk.\n\"At first I thought he was going to take the cupcake, eat it and then dunk it,\" said Howard. \"I thought he would have won with that.\""}

To enforce security, the Pakistani police is backed up by some 80,000 troops. BBC's Chris Morris says 80 million people are eligible to vote, but many are expected to stay at home, largely because of fears about security. Authorities reported at least five explosions that had taken place on election day, all but one of which occurred near a polling place.\nThe two most important opposition parties, the Pakistan People's Party and the Pakistan Muslim League, say that allies of current president Pervez Musharraf plan a massive fraud on the election. \"Whether he will be able to do the Election Day rigging or not remains to be seen,\" said Ahmed Bilal Mehboob, director of the Pakistan Institute of Legislative Development and Transparency. \"But the signs are that the government is positioning itself to manipulate the elections.\" The authorities have repeatedly claimed that the elections will be free and fair, although President Musharraf has warned against street protests.\nIf the opposition parties gain a two-thirds majority in Parliament, they could then take steps to impeach the President. This possibility of impeachment has led some political analysts, like Talat Masood, to describe the election as \"a referendum for or against [Musharraf].\" \n\"I think we have reached the breaking point where if we don't band together, we will lose this great nation which we call Pakistan,\" says Ms Bhutto's widower and successor as party leader, Asif Ali Zardari."}

While NASA hope that it can land at the Kennedy Space Center's Shuttle Landing Facility (SLF), they are prepared to use their backup site at Edwards Air Force Base, should the conditions at the SLF be unacceptable for landing. The backup site is not usually considered for the first landing attempt, but is being considered an option for STS-122 because of the US Navy's intention to destroy a failed spy satellite in orbit. This is expected to create debris, which could potentially damage spacecraft passing through the orbit that the spy satellite is in, such as a re-entering Shuttle.\nDuring STS-122, the \"Columbus\" module was added to the ISS, and a nitrogen coolant tank was replaced. \"Atlantis\" also collected a failed control gyroscope from the station, which had been replaced during the earlier STS-118 mission. A crew rotation also occurred, with French astronaut L\u00e9opold Eyharts replacing American Daniel M. Tani as a member of the Station's Expedition 16 crew.\nMeanwhile, \"Endeavour\", which is scheduled to fly the next Shuttle Mission, has been moved to the launch pad.

Most of the EU's 27-member nations are expected to recognize Kosovo. The United States is prepared to recognize Kosovo as well; President George W. Bush supported their actions during his trip to Africa. In an interview broadcast live from Tanzania, Bush said, \"The Kosovans are now independent. It's something I've advocated along with my government.\"\nMeanwhile, Serbia continued to oppose Kosovo, and has now taken legal action against its leaders. Serbian lawmakers rejected the proclamation as \"invalid\" and \"illegal\". The President, Prime Minister, and Speaker of Kosovo were charged with \"a serious criminal act against the constitutional order and security of Serbia\", according to the Interior Ministry.\nSerbia will also attempt to prevent Kosovo from gaining admission into the U.N. and other international organizations, with the help of Russia. \"The so-called Kosovo state will never be a member of the United Nations,\" said Serbian foreign minister Vuk Jeremic. \"Serbia will use all diplomatic means at its disposal to block Kosovo's recognition.\"\nRussia, which has historically been against Kosovan independence, reiterated their opposition to the act. \"Our position is that this declaration should be disregarded by the international community,\" said Vitaly Churkin, Russia's United Nations ambassador. Churkin said he worried for the safety of the Serb minority in Kosovo. \"We'll strongly warn against any attempts at repressive measures should Serbs in Kosovo decide not to comply with this unilateral proclamation of independence,\" he said.\nSeveral thousand ethnic Serbs living in Kosovo went to rallies to protest the declaration, where chants of \"This is Serbia!\" could be heard. Marko Jaksic, leader of the Serbian Assembly of Kosovo and Metohija, showed up at one of the rallies. \"America is no longer the single world power,\" he said. \"The Russians are coming. As long as there is Russia and Serbia, there will never be an independent Kosovo.\"\nProtests held in the Bosnian city of Banja Luka were more violent. Dissenters held up signs reading \"Kill the Albanians!\", and stones and eggs were reportedly thrown at police.\nThe European Union has agreed to send some 2,000 police officers and civil administrators to Kosovo to stabilize the situation and help build institutions. \"I think it's very important that we recognise that all of the countries of the Western Balkans are European countries and therefore it's critical that Europe shows real leadership in how it ensures that peace and stability are the order of the day,\" said United Kingdom foreign secretary David Miliband.\nDespite the majority of European Union members that are expected to recognize Kosovo, several nations, including Spain, have already rejected their claim to independence. \"The government of Spain will not recognize the unilateral act proclaimed yesterday by the assembly of Kosovo,\" said Spanish foreign minister Miguel Angel Moratinos. Spain thinks the declaration does not respect international law, he explained.\nIn China, Foreign Ministry spokesman Liu Jianchao expressed concern over Kosovo's bid for independence. \"Kosovo's unilateral act can produce a series of results that will lead to seriously negative influence on peace and stability in the Balkan region,\" he said. \nOther nations which will not recognize Kosovo include Sri Lanka, Cyprus, Greece, Slovakia, Bulgaria, Romania, Indonesia, Vietnam, and Azerbaijan.\nThe United Nations Security Council is scheduled to discuss the issue later today.

Kennedy. They were discovered over a year ago in a safe at the county courthouse.\nAmong these items is a two-page transcript of a conversation alleged to have taken place between Lee Harvey Oswald, who was arrested for assassinating Kennedy, and Jack Ruby, who shot and killed Oswald two days after he was arrested. If the conversation was found to be real, it would provide support for many conspiracy theories regarding the assassination. \"It will open up the debate as to whether or not there was a conspiracy to assassinate the president,\" Watkins said.\nThe transcript suggests that Oswald and Ruby met at Ruby's nightclub on October 4, 1963, where they discussed a plan to \"get rid of\" then-Attorney General Robert Kennedy by shooting his brother, the President. \"I can still do it, all I need is my rifle and a tall building,\" Oswald purportedly said. \"But it will take time, maybe six months to find the right place...\" Ruby says the money for the operation will be coming from the Mafia, but when Oswald asks Ruby if he is with the Mafia, Ruby replies with, \"You're asking too many questions.\"\nSome have dismissed the transcript as fake, saying it reads more like a screenplay than an actual conversation. \"It's not real. Crooks don't talk like that,\" said Terri Moore, top assistant to Craig Watkins. Also found in the safe were letters written by former District Attorney Henry Wade regarding a movie he was working on, titled \"Countdown in Dallas\". It is unclear how much work was done on the film, although a movie deal signed by Wade was among the documents found. \n\"The fact that it's sitting in Henry Wade's file, and he didn't do anything, indicates he thought it wasn't worth anything,\" said Gary Mack, curator of the Sixth Floor Museum. \"He probably kept it because it was funny. It's hilarious. It's like a bad B movie.\" Mack says the conversation could not have taken place, as Oswald is believed to have been in Irving the night of October 4. \nAlthough Craig Watkins believes the transcript is likely a fake, he said he could not immediately dismiss it as such. Even if the document is bogus, he says, he had always questioned the official explanation for Kennedy's death. \"You know me: I'm always a conspiracy theorist,\" Watkins said. \"It was too simple of an explanation. I don't see that.\"\nThe other items found in the safe, including Jack Ruby's brass knuckles, a leather gun holster, documents from Ruby's trial, and clothes belonging to Ruby and Oswald, are believed to be genuine. After all the items have been scanned, Watkins plans to donate them to a third party, so that they can be viewed by the public. \"Our motto has always been that everything is open. We have nothing to hide. So we\u2019re making public everything that we have found in the safe,\" Watkins said."}

This is revealed in \"Volkskrant\"-journalist Anet Bleich's biography of former Dutch Prime Minister Joop den Uyl. Den Uyl decided to keep the Northrop bribe quiet to save the Dutch Monarchy another scandal similar to the Lockheed scandal, Bleich states.\nDen Uyl covered up the Northrop bribe in 1976 to prevent a law suit against the prince, which could have led to an abdication of Queen Juliana, and a denial of Princess Beatrix to succeed her mother on the throne. During the investigations on the bribe cases Minister of Finance Wim Duisenberg (who would later be the first president of the European Central Bank) visited Beatrix, and \"found her quite desperate. Se had the idea that this opened a sewer of which the stench was unbearable. She was the future queen, but started to doubt whether she should do that, and that would have caused a major crisis in the Netherlands\".\nThe Lockheed scandal was never brought to court, although it had consequences for the Prince: he was forced to resign all his military functions. A second scandal would have resulted in official law suit, with all the consequences thereafter.\nRumours that Prince Bernhard not only received US$1.1 million from Lockheed, but also a considerable amount from another competitor for securing the purchase contract for fighter jets, are now confirmed. Northrop paid a total amount of US$750,000 to the Prince in the period until 1973. Bleich bases her conclusions on a secret document that was kept in Den Uyl's personal archives until this day. \nNorthrop merged with Grumman in 1994 to form Northrop Grumman. Similarly, Lockheed merged with Martin Marietta in 1995, creating Lockheed Martin. On 30 April 1980 Beatrix succeeded her mother to the Dutch throne. Joop den Uyl died on December 24; 1987, Prince Bernhard on December 1, 2004. "}

A modified SM-3 missile was launched from the USS Lake Erie at 03:26 GMT this morning, and intercepted the USA-193 satellite around three minutes later. It has been reported that the satellite has broken into around 80 pieces, some of which have already re-entered the Earth's atmosphere. The SM-3 missile was designed to shoot down other missiles, however for this launch, it was modified to act as an anti-satellite weapon (ASAT). This was the first time the US military had used an ASAT since 1985. China, however, destroyed an old orbiting satellite on January 11, 2007.\nThe satellite, which was known by the designations USA-193 and NRO L-21, was launched in December 2006, by a Delta II rocket. It was believed to have been a new type of spy satellite, however it was reported to have failed within hours of launch. This resulted in it being stranded in a decaying orbit, with a full tank of potentially toxic hydrazine propellant. The officially stated purpose of destroying the satellite was to prevent possible contamination from the hydrazine, and protect public safety should it land in a populated area. Claims that the destruction was politically motivated \u2014 to demonstrate to China, who tested an anti-satellite weapon last year \u2014 or to ensure that the satellite's classified technology did not survive re-entry and land in a hostile country, have been denied by officials. Officials believe the hydrazine tank has been destroyed, however it will take about a day to confirm this.\nThe Chinese government, who received criticism from the US government for shooting down one of their own satellites last year, have claimed the satellite's destruction represents \"possible harm to outer space security\". Bryan Whitman, a spokesman for the US government replied that destroying the satellite was \"about reducing the risk to human life on Earth, nothing more\"."}

In its own follow-up story, \"The Washington Post\" quoted John Weaver, who split with McCain last year, as saying he met with lobbyist Iseman and urged her to steer clear of McCain.\nBut McCain said he was unaware of any such conversation, and denied that his aides ever tried to talk to him about his interactions with Iseman.\n\"I never discussed it with John Weaver.

Neither story asserted that there was a sexually-oriented relationship and offered no evidence that there was, reporting only that aides worried about the appearance of McCain having close ties to a lobbyist with business before the Senate Commerce Committee on which McCain served.\nOne of McCain's senior advisers, Charlie Black, told CNN that the campaign first learned in October (2007) the paper was working on a story about McCain's relationship with Iseman.\nHe said that information and documents provided to the paper disputes suggestions McCain tried to use his influence to help Iseman.\nBlack further said \"The New York Times\" is a liberal newspaper that was printing \"rumors and gossip\" to arrive at a harder truth, described as a humble attack on the conservative McCain.\n\"He doesn't do favors for anyone,\" Black said of McCain.

We will work together to form a government together,\" said Sharif. A smaller opposition party, the Awami National Party, will also be helping the new government, according to the party leaders.\n\"The future of democracy is within our grasp,\" Zardari said. \"We will strengthen the parliament, we will strengthen democracy, we will work together for Pakistan. We will make a stronger Pakistan.\"\nZadari says the parties have agreed \"in principle\" to join together, although details of the agreement have not yet been finalized and remain unclear. \"Governance is a serious business,\" Zadari said, \"and everything cannot be decided at a two-hour meeting. We will be meeting again off and on.\" \nThe two leaders did not mention any plans to impeach Musharraf from office, which would require a two-thirds majority in Parliament. But Zadari seemed to indicate that \"pro-Musharraf forces\" would not be included in the coalition. \"I don't believe pro-Musharraf forces exist,\" he said.\nOne thing the parties have already agreed on is the reinstatement of judges fired by Musharraf during the state of emergency last November. \"In principle there's no disagreement on restoration of the judiciary. We will work on the modalities in parliament,\" said Sharif.\nOne of the displaced judges is Chief Justice Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudary, who remains under house arrest in Islamabad. Pakistani lawyers protested his arrest in the capital and other major cities. Through smuggled cell phones, Chaudary spoke to the protesters, telling them, \"Victory is not far off now.\" Police threw tear gas at the protesters, some of whom were hurling stones and burning effigies of the president.\nThe Pakistan Peoples Party won 88 seats and the Pakistan Muslim League (N) won 66 in the 272-member National Assembly. The pro-Musharraf Pakistan Muslim League only won 40 seats, thus losing their majority in Parliament."}

The meetings, also known as AUSMIN, have been held annually since 1985.\nAustralia has recently announced plans to withdraw troops from Iraq, but Gates indicated that this would not be a source of friction between the two allies.\n\"We're concerned about the stress on our own forces.

Fallon, the commander of United States Central Command, was speaking today in Ottawa, Canada at a defense conference. He made no mention of a pause.\nAnother topic at AUSMIN will be the military effort in Afghanistan, but Gates says he is not worried that Australia, now headed by Prime Minster Kevin Rudd, will reduce troop levels there.\n\"I've had two meetings with their defense minister at this point, and I don't have any sense of a change in direction in Afghanistan,\" Gates said.\nAustralia is expected, according to US defense officials, to request a greater role in decision-making process.

Democrats in more than 160 countries cast ballots by mail, fax, in person and for the first time, online. The group set up voting sites in more than 30 countries. The polls were open for one week, starting on February 5 and ending February 12. Most were not typical polling stations - balloting was held in bars, private clubs, or coffee shops.\nDemocrats Abroad is a officially sanctioned organization recognized by the national Democratic party. This means that Democrats Abroad gets 14 of the 4,000-plus votes at the national convention and is treated like a \"state committee\" despite not being an American state. However, the votes are half votes and not full votes. So far 9 delegates have been awarded due to the Global Primary, the other 5 will be chosen at a Democrats Abroad convention in Denver in April.\nThe chair of Democrats Abroad India, Carolyn Sauvage-Mar said, \"There were 100 and something voters who brought their kids, their friends, their families.

Giovanna Melandri, the Italian Minister for Youth and Sports holds dual citizenship in Italy and the United States, and is a Democrat, cast her vote for Obama.\n\"It wasn't an easy choice for me. I would still love seeing a ticket with Obama and Hillary, a drive for change is what is needed in the U.S. and I think that Obama has that drive,\" Melandri noted in a telephone interview with the \"Associated Press\".\nThe Republicans have their own organization for citizens overseas, Republicans Abroad, however, it is not treated as a \"state committee\" by the Republican National Committee which heads the Republican Party.

The warning follows a decision by the National Drugs and Poisons Schedule Committee (NDPSC) not to reschedule the drug.\nThe NDPSC had considered changing zolpidem from a Schedule 4 drug to a Schedule 8 drug, which would have placed it in the same category as drugs like morphine and made it more difficult for doctors to prescribe. The NDPSC said zolpidem did not meet criteria to become a Schedule 8 drug because there was insufficient evidence to suggest a \"substantial risk of abuse, dependence or misuse for illegal purposes\".\nThe warning follows more than 1000 reports of the drug causing people to walk, drive, eat and have sex while they slept, among other suspected reactions. A TGA spokeswoman said the Adverse Medicine Events Line had also received 19 reports of deaths, most of them suicides, where the patient had been taking zolpidem.\nThe spokeswoman said coronial inquests on most of these deaths had found no link between the death and zolpidem.\nThe warning to be included on the Consumer Medical Information sheet inside the packaging will say that the drug \"may be associated with potentially dangerous complex sleep-related behaviours \u2026 sleepwalking, sleep driving and other bizarre behaviours\".\nIt will also warn patients not to mix zolpidem with alcohol or other Central Nervous System depressants and the drug should \"limit use to four weeks maximum under close medical supervision\".\nSome patients have been prescribed the drug for a number of months, including 30-year-old Sydney woman Mairead Costigan, who fell to her death from the Sydney Harbour Bridge nearly six months ago. Costigan had been prescribed the drug for at least eight months, but just six days before her death she switched to another sleeping pill (zopiclone).\nMs Costigan's sister Siobhan said her family was disappointed but was not surprised by the TGA's decision.\n\"I understand that the committee received well over 100 submissions from members of the public who have been adversely affected or lost loved ones,\" she said.\nIndependent ACT politician and staunch opponent of the drug, Helen Cross said that after being prescribed zolpidem, she became addicted to it and tried to commit suicide three times. In one case, she sent friends a text message saying \"goodbye\" without remembering anything about the incident when police arrived to rescue her.\nWhile prescription information for the drug says it can increase depression and that \"suicidal tendencies may be present\", Ms Cross says doctors who prescribed the drug did not warn her about these side effects.\nA spokeswoman for the drug's manufacturer, Sanofi-Aventis said it supported the TGA's decision.\nThe criticism was a \"largely Australian-specific phenomenon and in our view does not accurately reflect [its] safety profile\", she said."}

The conference was organized by the Cluster Munitions Coalition, a network of 200 private organizations that includes leaders of the Nobel peace prize-winning International Campaign to Ban Landmines.\nActivists hope the draft, which was signed by representatives of 82 of the attending nations, will be turned into a binding treaty at a follow-up meeting scheduled in Ireland in May. \nHowever, British negotiators have warned that tough discussions lie ahead before a binding treaty is finally signed.\nThere is opposition to a global ban by the United States, Russia and China, as well as India, Pakistan and Israel. All are major producers of cluster munitions and none attended the Wellington summit. Washington opposes a ban because of the weapons' military effectiveness.\nBut Jody Williams, who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1997 for her work to ban landmines, says she believes an international ban on cluster bombs is inevitable.\n\"If we, you know, have 80 countries that subscribe to it at the end of Dublin, that will be in terrific, and the signing will be in December and we will use all of that time to bring more countries on board,\" she said. \"I think we're going to see a very exciting new treaty banning cluster munitions, demonstrating that even in this difficult time we can continue to ban weapons that are indiscriminate and cause untold civilian casualties and harm.\" \nCluster bombs are designed to explode above the ground and release thousands of small bomblets primed to detonate on impact. Many do not explode immediately, and can lie in fields or villages, where they later kill and maim people who come across them.\nEfforts toward an international ban began in Norway last year. The meeting in Wellington, and May's follow-up in Ireland, are part of what is being called the \"Oslo Process.\" "}

The vow follows a sitting on Friday where the House of Representatives descended into chaos. The opposition says it is protesting against the Friday sittings, which were ordered by the Rudd government to \"allow for greater scrutiny and accountability\".\nThe opposition is furious that the sittings will not include question time, have no proper votes and do not record quorum, allowing the Prime Minister and senior ministers to skip the session. The government dismisses this by saying that Friday is a day for private member's business and gives backbenchers an opportunity to be heard.\nSteven Ciobo (Liberal, Moncrieff) moved a motion that there should be question time held every Friday, which led to the opposition moving a motion of dissent against speaker of the house, Harry Jenkins (Labor, Skullin).\nAfter the vote on the motion of dissent was deferred, Mr Ciobo continued to argue for his motion after being requested to return to his seat. He was eventually asked to leave the chamber, but refused to do so and was escorted out by the Serjeant-at-Arms. Tony Abbott (Liberal, Warringah) was then ejected for an hour after he accused the speaker of acting \"dishonorably\" and refused to take his seat. Interjections by opposition MPs continued during a discussion about increasing organ donation rates, with the speaker losing control and suspending the house for 15 minutes.\nWhen parliament resumed, proceedings soon degraded again, after a life-size cardboard cut-out of Kevin Rudd was brought into the chamber by opposition MPs. Luke Hartsuyker (National, Cowper) used the prop during a discussion about the Rudd government axing a planned Centrelink call centre in Coffs Harbour. Mr Hartsuyker told parliament \"We want the Prime Minister here. I want Kevin Rudd to hear what 150 jobs...\".\nMr Hartsuyker was then ejected after refusing to take his seat at the direction of Deputy speaker, Anna Burke (Labor, Chisholm) who also demanded that the prop be removed. Ms Burke then removed Joanna Gash (Liberal, Gilmore) for making an offensive remark about the chair of the chamber. After more complaints from opposition MPs, the house was adjourned for a second time.\nUpon resumption of the house, Speaker Harry Jenkins told MPs they risked facing community condemnation unless they restored the dignity of parliament.\n\"I understand that some members have concerns about the arrangements of Friday sittings,\" he told the house.\n\"If our house is to expect the community to have confidence in it, all members should conduct themselves with decorum and dignity regardless of their views about particular matters - including the conduct of business on future Fridays.\"\nThe opposition has remained definant, promising to disrupt future Friday sittings.

He then said there had been \"no significant change in the way parliament has operated\".\nAlbanese insisted the new parliamentary sitting schedule did not disadvantage the opposition because it included more sitting days and question times than the previous government averaged. \"The changes gave all MPs, particularly backbenchers, the opportunity to put forward their ideas,\" he said."}

Nader, who also ran for president in the previous three elections, made the announcement on NBC's television program \"Meet the Press\".\n\"Dissent is the mother of ascent, and in that context I have decided to run for president,\" said Nader.\n\"In the last few years, big money and the closing down of Washington against citizen groups prevent us from trying to improve our country. And I want everybody to have the right and opportunity to improve their country.\" \nIn 2000, Nader ran for President as a Green Party candidate and received 2.7% of the popular vote. Many Democrats believe his campaign led to the election of Republican George W. Bush by taking away potential votes for Democrat Al Gore, especially in the state of Florida. Nader also ran in 2004 as an independent, but only garnered 0.4% of the vote.\nAt a press conference yesterday, Democratic candidate Barack Obama doubted that a potential Nader candidacy would have the same impact as in 2000. \"I think the job of the Democratic Party is to be so compelling that a few percentage of the vote going to another candidate's not going to make any difference,\" he said. \nToday, however, Obama was more disapproving of Nader. \"He thought that there was no difference between Al Gore and George Bush and, eight years later, I think people realize that Ralph did not know what he was talking about,\" Obama told reporters.\nDemocrat Hillary Clinton seemed more concerned about Nader's bid. \"Obviously it\u2019s not helpful to whoever our Democratic nominee is,\" she said. \"I remember when he did this before, it didn't turn out too well for anyone, especially our country.\" She said Nader \"prevented Al Gore from being the 'greenest' president we could have had\", and she hoped his bid will be \"just a passing fancy that people won't take too seriously.\" \nNader dismissed criticism of his entry into the race, saying, \"For anybody who thinks that the third try is something that should be demeaned, it represents persistence, it represents never giving up the struggle for justice.\"\nMeanwhile, Republican candidate Mike Huckabee welcomed Nader into the race, in the hopes that he will lessen the Democratic voter base. \"I think it would always pull votes away from the Democrats, not the Republicans,\" he said. \"So actually, Republicans would welcome his entry into the race and hope that a few more will join in.\""}

The Assembly has chosen Cuba's Council of State ever since the Socialist was approved by 97.7% of voters in a referendum in 1976.\nThis decision comes after Fidel Castro, who ruled as President ever since rising to power in 1959 with the Cuban Revolution, wrote a letter last Tuesday saying that he would not \"aspire to or accept... the positions of President of Council of State and Commander in Chief\" in today's election for a new President, who also becomes the leader of the Council of State and the Commander in Chief of the Cuban Revolutionary Armed Forces. According to Voice of America, he will still remain First Secretary of the Communist Party of Cuba, the only official party in the Communist state.\nWhile Cuban exiles in Miami, who have escaped Cuba and what they consider a dictatorship in search of a better life in the United States, celebrated Fidel's retirement as leader of the country, the Cuban streets of Havana, the country's capital, have remained calm and all has continued as normal.\nRa\u00fal, who is also Fidel's brother, has been acting president of Cuba since July 31, 2006, when Fidel transferred his presidential power to him after undergoing an emergency intestinal surgery for what is believed to be diverticulitis and was widely expected to be elected President.\nThe United States has said the change from one Castro to another would not bring about significant change in Cuba, calling it a \"transfer of authority and power from dictator to dictator light.\"\nBefore the Assembly meeting, BBC correspondents interviewed Cubans at the Havana Book Fair about what they think the most important task should be for the country's next leader.

Muhammadu Buhari and Atiku Abubakar, leaders of the two opposition parties who launched the case, have both said they will take their complaints to the Supreme Court.\nInternational suspicions were also raised at the time of the election, with some voicing concern over the politcal process. \nThe ruling could have negative impacts - it could be seen as an admittance of a 'false democracy' occurring in the last election and therefore undermining the political process in Nigeria. This could cause instability between political rivals and may spark protests.\nYar'Adua assumed office on 29th May 2007 after the election in April, where he won 70% of the vote. Since then, he has became the first Nigerian leader to declare his personal assets, as well as overturning hikes in petroleum and tax made by the previous government. Despite these positive steps, he has also been surrounded by controversy, with several governors who served him before 2007 being charged by the EFCC, the anti-corruption commission.\nElection annulments have been passed for seven of thirty-six state governors and even the senate president, David Mark."}

However, their actions mistakenly blocked the site on other international ISPs, preventing many countries' access to the popular site for around two hours. \nWilders is expected to release a movie about violence in Islamic culture. The film called Fitna would be set 'inside' the Koran, with a book frame surrounding the images and a mix of Koran verses with footage of executions and other violence in Islamic countries such as Iraq, Iran and Saudi Arabia.\nIn the United States, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) fear that the release of the movie might trigger a worldwide surge of violence. It is expected that the film will show the destruction of a Koran, which is \"tantamount to heresy\" in Islam, according to the FBI/DHS report. The Dutch Prime Minister has said that the movie has caused a serious crisis situation, with several Dutch embassies and companies abroad worrying about safety. Wilders has previously declared that the Koran should be banned, and he has compared it to Hitler's \"Mein Kampf\".\nThe PTA has also blocked websites depicting the controversial cartoons of Muhammad published by a Danish newspaper in 2006 that also sparked violence in the Muslim world. Some of the cartoons have recently been reprinted.\nThis is not the first time a country has moved to block YouTube.

Out of the 4.4 million customers served by Florida Power &amp; Light, Co.

It is estimated that as many as four million customers throughout Florida were affected, with many different power companies losing control of their specific grids. \nPower outages were reported as far south as the Florida Keys, on the original FPL grid, and as far north as Orlando and Daytona Beach, nearly away on the Progress Energy grid. Most of Miami-Dade and parts of Broward and Palm Beach counties suffered the worst outages. \nFPL President Armando Olivera said that a disconnect switch failed at 1:08 p.m. at the automated substation west of Miami, and a piece of equipment that controls voltage caught fire about the same time. Neither failure by itself would have caused a widespread outage. The event at the utility's Flagami substation consequently led to the rolling blackouts. \nOriginally the first failure was thought to have occurred at the utility's nuclear plant at Turkey Point. It is still unclear how failure at this site spread, but with power turning off at the main Turkey Point location, which serves all of south Florida, FPL's grid shut down as well. It contributed to a domino effect which ended up sapping energy from bordering grids all over Florida. \nPolice reported several people were stuck in the elevators of high-rise buildings in downtown Miami and several hospitals were running on backup power, although no injuries or fatalities have been reported. The blackouts caused major traffic jams and a few accidents, but the original outage was contained shortly after it occurred. All customers affected had power restored to them by 6:30 p.m. (23:30 UTC)."}

Located 800 kilometers from the North Pole on the Norwegian island of Spitsbergen, the vault has been referred to by European Commission president Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso as a \"frozen Garden of Eden\". It is intended to preserve crop supplies and secure biological diversity in the event of a worldwide disaster.\n\"The opening of the seed vault marks a historic turning point in safeguarding the world\u2019s crop diversity,\" said Cary Fowler, executive director of the Global Crop Diversity Trust which is in charge of collecting the seed samples. The Norwegian government, who owns the bank, built it at a cost of $9.1 million. \nAt the opening ceremony, 100 million seeds from 268,000 samples were placed inside the vault, where there is room for over 2 billion seeds. Each of the samples originated from a different farm or field, in order to best ensure biological diversity. These crop seeds included such staples as rice, potatoes, barley, lettuce, maize, sorghum, and wheat. No genetically modified crops were included. (Beyond politics they are generally sterile so of no use.)\nConstructed deep inside a mountain and protected by concrete walls, the \"doomsday vault\" is designed to withstand earthquakes, nuclear warfare, and floods resulting from global warming. Norwegian Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg called it an \"insurance policy\" against such threats.\nWith air-conditioned temperatures of -18 degrees Celsius, experts say the seeds could last for an entire millennium. Some crops will be able to last longer, like sorghum, which the Global Crop Diversity Trust says can last almost 20 millenniums. Even if the refrigeration system fails, the vaults are expected to stay frozen for 200 years.\nThe Prime Minister said, \"With climate change and other forces threatening the diversity of life that sustains our planet, Norway is proud to be playing a central role in creating a facility capable of protecting what are not just seeds, but the fundamental building blocks of human civilization.\" Stoltenberg, along with Kenyan Nobel Peace Prize laureate Wangari Maathai, made the first deposit of rice to the vault.\n\"It is very important for Africa to store seeds here because anything can happen to our national seed banks,\" Maathai said. The vault will operate as a bank, allowing countries to use their deposited seeds free of charge. It will also serve as a backup to the thousands of other seed banks around the world.\n\"Crop diversity will soon prove to be our most potent and indispensable resource for addressing climate change, water and energy supply constraints and for meeting the food needs of a growing population,\" Cary Fowler said."}

It is the highest ever fine charged by the EU (also being the largest fine of its kind ever imposed upon a company), and the first time that the EU has fined a company because of non-compliance with an antitrust decision.\nThe first decision in this antitrust case was given in 2004 citing that Microsoft withheld needed interoperability information from rival software companies which prevented them from making software compatible with Windows. The commission ordered Microsoft to provide this information. Microsoft agreed to this, providing the information for royalty fees of 6.5% of the licensee's revenues for the product on grounds of innovation (specifically, 3.87% for the patent license and of 2.98% for the information license). The EU found these royalty fees unreasonable and Microsoft was ordered to lower them. Microsoft complied with this, adjusting the royalty rates to 1.2% (changing the rates for the licenses to 0.7% and 0.5%, respectively) in the European Union, while keeping the rate the same for the rest of the world. The EU still saw this as an unreasonable rate, and Microsoft, two month after lowering the rates, reduced the rates yet again to a flat rate of \u20ac10000 or a royalty of 0.4% applicable worldwide. Microsoft's royalty rates, which were deemed unreasonable for the period of 15 months between June 21, 2006 and October 21, 2007 are the cause for the fine. So far, the EU has fined Microsoft \u20ac1.68 billion in 3 separate fines in this case. This fine will go towards the European Union annual budget.\nThe European Anti-trust commissioner Neelie Kroes stated that the fine was \"reasonable and proportionate\", as the figure could have gone up as high as \u20ac1.5 billion, the maximum that the EU commission can impose. She also said that it should act as \"a signal to the outside world, and especially Microsoft, that they should stick to the rules\" and that \"Talk is cheap. Flouting the rules is expensive\". Although she also expressed hope that \"today's decision closes a dark chapter in Microsoft's record of non-compliance with the Commission\".\nThere is no certainty whether Microsoft will appeal this decision, a Microsoft Spokesperson has stated that Microsoft will review this latest fine, citing that \"The commission announced in October 2007 that Microsoft was in full compliance with the 2004 decision, so these fines are about the past issues that have been resolved.\" Microsoft`s General Counsel Brad Smith commented \"It's clearly very important to us as a company that we comply with our obligations under European law. We'll study this decision carefully, and if there are additional steps that we need to take in order to comply with it, we will take them.\" Microsoft had appealed to fines by the EU before, but all the charges were defeated. If Microsoft does not appeal the decision, the company will have 3 month (starting February 27th) to pay the fine in full. The fine must be paid in Euros.\nMicrosoft CEO Steve Ballmer stated that the company had news that the fine was pending. \"We knew it was pending,\" Ballmer told interviewers. \"We didn't know it was this week, but we knew it was coming at some point.\" \nThis may not be the end of Microsoft's troubles with the European Union yet, as the commission is currently investigating two other complaints about the company's anti-competition practices.\nThe decisions came after Microsoft announced they were disclosing 30,000 pages of previously secret software code last Thursday (February 21st). The EU competition commissioner's commented that this move \"does not necessarily equal a change in business practice.\"\nMicrosoft was set to launch three new products: Windows Server 2008, SQL Server 2008 and Visual Studio 2008 at its \"Heroes Happen Here\" event today. Microsoft shares slipped 12 cents to $28.26 on NASDAQ after news of the fine."}

This would allow the number of flights to increase from 480,000 a year to around 702,000 .\nIn a statement given by one of the protesters from the roof to the Guardian newspaper: \nMatthew Knowles from the Society of British Aerospace Companies made a statement to the B.B.C. that: \"These stunts are becoming tiresome and do nothing more than peddle inaccurate propaganda.\"\nThe rooftop occupation comes two days after Greenpeace protesters scaled an Airbus A320 which had just touched down at Heathrow from Manchester, and follows a succession of direct action protests in the U.K. in relation to climate change.

The organisation does not permit consumer boycotts of other countries by its members.\nSince the cartoons were published by 17 Danish newspapers earlier this month\u2014along with a number of foreign ones\u2014there have been demonstrations and attacks on Danish embassies and consulates in Pakistan, Jordan and Indonesia.\nThe Sudanese boycotts and demonstrations throughout the Muslim world have already claimed the first jobs at Arla, the main Danish provider of dairy products, who has seen itself forced to fire 8\u201310 employees due to lowered demand."}

How will I reconcile with people who killed my sons? It is impossible, even if Kibaki and Raila are in the same government,\" she said.\nParliament is to convene next week to enact the measures. Mr. Annan said the negotiations would resume Friday on long-term issues such as constitutional reform and ways to end inequalities in land and wealth distribution.\nThe two sides have been meeting for nearly five weeks in an effort to find a political solution to the Kenya crisis. One thousand people were killed and several hundred thousand were displaced in the violence that erupted after Mr. Kibaki was declared the winner of a presidential election that the opposition says was rigged."}

The man lapsed into unconsciousness and has been at the hospital ever since.\nSince the bills at the hotel were going unpaid, Extended Stay America began to evict the man from the room. Another man, described as either a friend or relative, went to the hotel on Thursday to collect the personal belongings of the hospitalized man.\nAccording to Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department Deputy Chief Kathy Suey, he found several vials of a white substance. He brought them to the attention of the hotel manager, who called police.\nInitial tests, which further tests confirmed on Friday, the substance was the deadly toxin ricin, an extremely dangerous biological agent. Ricin is extracted from castor beans through the waste produced in the manufacture of castor oil. It is currently being used in cancer treatment research. There has been research for its use as a chemical/biological warfare agent. An amount smaller than the point of a pin will kill a human being. It is estimated to be several thousand times more toxic than cyanide and there is no known antidote.\nPolice cordoned off the area around Valley View between Flamingo Road and Harmon Avenue. Three employees and the man who made the discovery were taken to the hospital as a precaution. So were three police officers. They are all reported to show no signs of poisoning.\nNevada National Guard and other emergency services responded to secure the area.

However, survivors often have long-term organ damage.\nAt least three pets were found in the room. \"Two of those pets are fine. One of the pets is deceased or was put down,\" Suey said. \"The dog that was in there was without food and water for a week,\" she added that there was no reason to supect it was exposed to ricin. Castor beans were also found in the room.\nOfficials have also recovered from the room a firearm, as well as an \"anarchist\" text containing an article on ricin.\nFederal Bureau of Investigation spokesperson Richard Kolko said the incident is being treated as a criminal matter and did not appear to be related to terrorism \"based on the information gathered so far.\"\nCaptain Joe Lombardo of the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department said that ricin is not illegal to own unless it is intended for the poisoning of a person, adding that \"We did have enough ricin to be of concern.\"\nIn 2003, a man committed suicide in Las Vegas using ricin. There have also been a few incidents where ricin powder was found in the mail. Also in 2003, the United Kingdom had the Wood Green ricin plot which in the end found no ricin.\nIn 1978, Bulgarian defector Georgi Markov was famously assassinated in London with ricin injected with the tip of an umbrella."}

() have unexpectedly defeated Boeing for a US$40 billion (GB\u00a320.1 billion) contract to supply the United States Air Force (USAF) with 179 new aerial refueling tankers at a rate of 15 a year.\nIt is the biggest contract of its kind since the Joint Strike Fighter program. That contract was fought for between Boeing and Lockheed Martin, Lockheed ultimately winning the contest.\nJSA Research defence analysist Paul Nesbit said that Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul (MRO) operations across the aircraft's fifty-year service life could push the value of the contract as high as US$100 billion. Northrop Grumman CEO Ron Sugar said in an interview \"Everyone told us we were crazy, that we had no chance. But we took a big swing and in this case, we hit a home run.\"\nUSAF officials said that the contract had been awarded based on competence, track record and competitive pricing, with UBS analyst David Strauss saying \"The key decision was the amount of fuel the bigger plane could carry. In the armed services, you can never have too much gas in the air.\" USAF also denied that creating jobs in the US was a factor; job supply had been the reason Boeing were expected to win, with the airframer promising 44,000 new positions at 300 suppliers in 40 states.\nThe Northrop Grumman KC-45 tankers - more often known as KC-30s - are based on the Airbus A330 MRTT. The first four aircraft will be assembled at the main Airbus factory in Toulouse, France but by 2010-11 production of the remainder will be carried out at a facility in Mobile, Alabama. This is thought likely to create 1,500 to 2,000 jobs and support 25,000 others. 60% of the parts will be supplied by domestic manufacturers. EADS had previously announced plans to shift much production to the US due to the current weakness of the dollar.\nGeneral Arthur Lichte, head of USAF's Mobility Command, said it is hoped the first aircraft can be tested in 2010 and in operation three years afterwards. USAF's chief of staff General Duncan McNab stated \"The tanker is the number-one procurement priority for us right now. It is the first step in our critical commitment to recapitalize our aging fleet to move, supply, and position assets anywhere.\"\nThere is still a possibility of Boeing challenging the decision; Boeing themselves were successfuly challenged by Lockheed and Sikorsky in 2006 over a US$10 billion contract to supply search and rescue helicopters to the Pentagon. A statement by Boeing given by Boeing spokesman William Barksdale said \u201cObviously we are very disappointed... Once we have reviewed the details behind the award, we will make a decision concerning our possible options.\u201d \nWashington senator Patty Murray, who hails from the same state where Boeing bases their commercial airliner operations, said in a critical statement \"We are shocked that the Air Force tapped a European company and its foreign workers to provide a tanker to our American military. At a time when our economy is hurting, this decision to outsource our tankers is a blow to the American aerospace industry, American workers and America's military.\" \nWashington representative Norm Dicks said he too was \"shocked\", releasing a statement saying \"This decision is even more disappointing because the Air Force had previously favored the Boeing 767 tanker and we were prepared to move forward with the production of 100 tankers in 2003, before the process was halted due to the Boeing scandal. I regret that it has taken so long to respond to what was\u2014and is\u2014an urgent need to replace these older aircraft. And even more regrettable is the decision to award the contract to Airbus, which has consistently used unfair European government subsidies to take jobs away from American aircraft workers.\" \nKansas senator Sam Brownback said \"It's stunning to me that we would outsource the production of these airplanes to Europe instead of building them in America. I'll be calling upon the Secretary of Defense for a full debriefing and expect there will be a protest of the award by Boeing.\" Todd Tiahrt, a Kansas representative, said \"We should have an American tanker built by an American company with American workers. I cannot believe we would create French jobs in place of Kansas jobs.\"\nA group of Washington politicians released a joint statement saying \"We will be asking tough questions about the decision to outsource this contract... At a time when our economy is hurting, this is a blow not only to our state, but more than 40 states across the country who would help build this national plane.\" \nAlabama Governor Bob Riley said \"To say this is a great day for Alabama is a monumental understatement. This will go down in history as one of our greatest days.\" Ralph Crosby, EADS's North America CEO and ex Northrop executive commented the business has \"committed our full resources to support this vital program for our prime contractor, Northrop Grumman, the Air Force, and the war fighters that this system will serve for decades to come. We already have begun the work necessary to expand our U.S. industrial footprint in support of this important program.\" \nEADS chief executive Louis Gallois commented \u201cThis major selection is a win-win for our customers, for allied industrial cooperation and for EADS. It signals a quantum-leap forward in our commitment to the US defence customer, reflects and supports our global strategy to increase EADS\u2019s industrial presence in key markets and our goal to balance the company\u2019s defence and commercial portfolios.\u201d General Arthur Lichte said \u201cThis will be an American tanker, flown by American airmen with an American flag on its tail and, every day, it will be saving American lives. \nBoeing had initially agreed to lease 100 tankers, but in 2003 a scandal erupted when it emerged that Boeing executive Michael M. Sears arranged a job for USAF official Darleen Druyun while negotiations were still underway. Both served jail sentences for corruption charges and a competition was opened up to award a new contract."}

After launching an air strike on the rebel base, the Colombian military came under fire from the guerrilas. The military fired back, killing Reyes while in Ecuadorian territory. The bodies of the dead were then taken to Colombia.\n\"Once the camp was bombarded, Colombian forces were ordered in to secure the area and neutralize the enemy.

The ritual is incongruent with her position as a Kumari.\nLast year, Shakya made headlines and sparked controversy when she visited the United States to attend the release of the movie Living Goddess, which portrayed three Kumari during the Nepalese Civil War. She risked losing her title because the visit was against tradition, but the threat was later withdrawn.\nKumari are believed to be living incarnations of the goddess K\u0101l\u012b. In order to become a Kumari, one must be chosen by Nepal's indigenous Newa people by passing ritual tests and having 32 beautiful physical attributes. Examples of these attributes include having eyelashes like a cow and thighs like a deer.\nKumaris automatically lose their status when they menstruate, at which point K\u0101l\u012b supposedly leaves her body. Severe illness or extreme loss of blood are also reasons to have a girl lose her Kumari status.\nNepal is a landlocked country famous for having Mount Everest on its border with Tibet. Roughly the size of England, its unemployment rate is at approximately 47%, according to a 2001 estimate.\nSome human rights activists have petitioned the Supreme Court of Nepal to end the practice because it denies the girl a normal life; the apex court has yet to deliver a judgment."}

Associated Press and ABC News have also reported on questionable activity by Wales involving Wikimedia Foundation expenses. The Wikimedia Foundation is a donor-supported non-profit organization which runs Wikipedia.\nMarsden had contacted Wales two years ago about concerns she had over the article about her on Wikipedia, and Wales determined the article was not compliant with Wikipedia's standards. The tech blog Valleywag revealed Wales had a personal relationship with Marsden, and posted supposed transcripts of their instant message conversations on its site, www.valleywag.com. Wales and Marsden met in February, and \"The Times\" reported that \"An apparent transcript of their conversations before that meeting suggests that, although Mr Wales had withdrawn from the editing process, he was still influencing the editors.\" \"The Times\" quoted Wales from the chat logs as having stated to Marsden \"The truth is of course a much worse conflict of interest than that; but that will do.\" \u2014 in reference to his conflict of interest regarding Marsden's article on Wikipedia.\nWales posted a public statement on Saturday on Wikipedia addressing the matter, and stated that his relationship with Marsden was over: \"First, while I find it hard to imagine that anyone really cares about my sex life, the facts are: I am separated from my wife. I considered myself single at the time of my one meeting with Rachel Marsden on Feb. 9, 2008 ... I am no longer involved with Rachel Marsden. Gossipy stories suggesting that I have been in a relationship with her 'since last fall' are completely false ... I care deeply about the integrity of Wikipedia, and take very seriously my responsibilities as a member of the board and as a member of the Wikipedia community. I would never knowingly do anything to compromise that trust.\" With regard to the conflict of interest in Marsden's article, Wales had acknowledged to a team of Wikipedia editors in February 2008 that he and Marsden \"became friends ... and that we would be meeting about that,\" and stated \"I recused myself from any further official action with respect to her biography.\"\nOn Sunday, \"The Canadian Press\" reported that Marsden had posted photos of herself on Ebay, and was selling items that Wales had left at her New York City apartment. In her Ebay posting, Marsden stated: \"Hi, my name is Rachel and my (now ex-) boyfriend, Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales, just broke up with me via an announcement on Wikipedia ... It was such a classy move that I was inspired to do something equally classy myself, so I'm selling a couple of items of clothing he left behind, here in my NYC apartment, on eBay. Jimbo was supposed to come visit me in a couple of weeks and pick up some of his stuff, but obviously that won't be happening now.\" Marsden told \"The Canadian Press\" \"It didn't really help matters that Jimmy chose to announce the breakup to the entire world via Wikipedia (which apparently now is an online encyclopedia that doubles as a personal soapbox?) rather than to me directly (which he did much later, in an instant message discussion).\"\nMarsden placed a t-shirt and sweater which she said were left at her apartment by Wales up on Ebay, and started the bidding for each at ninety-nine cents, with the auctions set to end on March 12. By Monday, bidding on the t-shirt had reached US$300, and by Tuesday the highest bid had reached $12,200. In an email to \"The Globe and Mail\", Marsden stated \"My only focus right now, to be really honest, is on my career and finding a way to get back into print, TV, or radio here in NYC,\" she wrote. \"All of this other personal stuff is just an unfortunate distraction.\"\nJay Walsh, the Wikimedia Foundation's head of communications, told the \"San Jose Mercury News\" that Wales' actions in relaying Marsden's concerns about her Wikipedia article to a team of trusted editors was within his \"routine\" role. When asked by the \"San Jose Mercury News\" if Wales' actions regarding the Marsden article could compromise his role with the Wikimedia Foundation and Wikipedia, Walsh responded \"No, absolutely not.\"\nOn Tuesday, ABC News carried a story by \"Wired News\" reporter Megan McCarthy regarding allegations of \"excessive spending\" by Wales, and Associated Press also reported on questions involving Wikimedia Foundation expenses. McCarthy reported that former Wikimedia executive Danny Wool, who had left the foundation last year, criticized Wales' use of Wikimedia Foundation expenses in a blog post. Wool stated that Wales had tried to expense $300 bottles of wine, a $1,300 dinner for four at a Florida steakhouse, and visits to Moscow massage parlors to the foundation, and that the foundation rescinded Wales' corporate credit card in 2006. Wool also stated that Wales paid the foundation $7,000, after being short $30,000 on receipts for expenses. \nWool told EPICENTER that \"There were occasions where he used [the Wikimedia Foundation] for personal advancement under the guide [\"sic\"] of the mission. And, as someone who was in there for the mission part of it, I found that rather distressful.\" Wool commented in an interview with the \"San Francisco Chronicle\": \"Originally, it was carelessness ... But as things developed, it became more apparent and obvious that he was taking advantage of the foundation credit card. It was almost like his personal piggy bank.\"\nIn an instant message exchange with Associated Press, Wales denied that the Wikimedia Foundation had taken away his corporate credit card, and asserted that he had made the decision to stop expensing business travel for the foundation. Wales highlighted a statement by the foundation's executive director Sue Gardner: \"Jimmy has never used Wikimedia money to subsidize his personal expenditures. Indeed, he has consistently put the foundation's interests ahead of his own.\" In an email to Associated Press, Brad Patrick, a former attorney for the Wikimedia Foundation, stated \"Danny seems interested in blogging his way straight to a lawsuit\". \nFlorence Devouard, who chairs the Wikimedia Foundation, told Associated Press that Wales had been \"slow in submitting receipts,\" and that the foundation had rejected Wales' expense at the Florida steakhouse. Devouard told fellow foundation board members in a private email that she had convinced Associated Press that \"the money story was a no story,\" and told Wales \"I find (it) tiring to see how you are constantly trying to rewrite the past. Get a grip!\" Wales told Associated Press: \"The board, the current executive director, the previous executive director, and independent auditors have reviewed our books and publicly agree that all of my expenses were appropriate and fully accounted for.\"\nMedia reports speculated on how the controversy would end up being represented in Wikipedia itself. On Wednesday, the \"St. Petersburg Times\" wrote: \"Wales' Wikipedia page said only this about Marsden: 'Wales had a brief relationship with Canadian journalist Rachel Marsden.'\" An article in \"The Australian\" surmised: \"History will decide whether Mr Wales broke his own principles, but before that happens there may well be a Wikipedia page devoted to the controversy.\""}

The position lasts until June this year, after which he has stated he will decide whether he will run for a full term of two years. As well as working for the Wikimedia Foundation, he is employed by MySQL AB.\nIn light of his recent appointment to the board, \"Wikinews\" conducted the following interview with Domas Mituzas.\nInterview.\nCongratulations on your new board position! Can you tell us a bit about your background - previous work with the Foundation, what you do with MySQL AB etc?\nDomas Mituzas: Thanks! Though my first edits to Wikipedia were in 2003, I became actively involved in site technology back in 2004. Then I was working for a major IT company in the Baltic States, and was leading the systems group there. Back then I could apply quite a bit of practice I had from my job to maintain Wikipedia in its technology infancy. It became increasingly involving, and eventually the things we started doing became far more complex, especially when the exploding growth hit us. Managing the growth and sustaining the site up was quite stressful at that time, and we started both lots of optimization and resource expansion work. Eventually I got involved in the MySQL community, and was suggested to apply for a job in MySQL AB. There I work in services division, assisting our customers with their problems, helping to grow their operations. Now as part of company acquisition I'm joining Sun Microsystems, and I'm eager to see what possibilities can that provide. \nBack in my childhood I was deep into encyclopedias, first dead tree ones, later CDs and online version of Britannica. I had a dream, that once I get my own home, I'll get full dead-tree version of Britannica on my bookshelves. It didn't happen, as I got into Wikipedia the same year I bought my apartment. Life is full of irony :-)\nActually, back in 2000 I approached university professor and tried to explain him a concept of dynamically edited news repository, where every concept could be explained deeper and deeper into elemental knowledge particles, and later that can be assembled in many dynamic ways. His first question was \"Is that some kind of website?\", and I was angry at him for not getting the generic concept of knowledge at all. Year or two afterwards I was discussing same concepts with a colleague, and he provided with far more practical visions of all that. Seeing Wikipedia for the very first time was a dejavu, so it was easy to get into the project. That is different from what I imagined, but far more useful.\nWhy do you think you were chosen for this position, and what do you think you can contribute?\nDM: One of reasons was both my long-term presence in site operations and communicating about our work, spreading our ideology, providing opinions. I try to be able to explain difficult topics in human language, and that is quite well appreciated. Additionally, I was being a bit of outsider - more of a reader than writer, so I feel that my views are slightly less community centric, more of value centric. My experience in a technology team is quite similar to what I expect to see in the board - wide array of issues to work on, and maintaining consensus is incredibly important to keep the productivity high. So even though I have deep roots in the project, I feel that I can bring in lots of fresh ways to the board. Of course, I will try to provide best possible technology advise, if the board needs it.\nWill you continue doing your previous technical work at the same time? If you do, how will you find a balance?\nDM: I would really avoid to do all previous work - but it is not needed any more. Years ago we were monitoring the site 24/7, shortage of resources was causing all sorts of difficult problems. Now everything is way more steady and reliable, so I have way much more free time. I used to do lots of other activities too, so I think I can scale my time just fine. And still, of course, I'll provide as much work to technical part as needed, it just isn't as demanding as it used to be, and we're really happy about that.\nWhat major actions do you expect to come your way during your term in office?\nDM: Though my term is quite short for now (until June elections), the biggest work will be done in understanding how the foundation should function to establish a really long-term presence, to support the projects far into the future. It may need changes in how we get external experience, how we interact with other organizations, how we do interact with office staff and each other. Foundation did lots of work to get to stable and reliable state, now it is time to think more about the future sustainability and expansion.\nI have operations experience, so of course I will want to maintain high efficiency of overall operation, but on the other hand I want to work on scaling other parts of the foundation - especially reach out, evangelism, and of course - fundraising. \nDo you expect any major upgrades to be needed to hardware or software anytime soon, and if so what?\nDM: Projects are always growing - pages, pageviews, revisions, users, media, archives - to facilitate that there will always be major upgrades. We still have some of the solutions that allowed us to survive for years, but are not suitable for a whole millennium. There will always be new features, that will need more resources, so we definitely won't stop improving our hardware or software platform. I have to take off the board member hat to answer these questions, as they should be really directed to technology team, instead of board. I won't mention exact projects, but we have a trail of features that have to be implemented, and will be, soon. But indeed, that is very much operational issue, that the technology team and foundation staff is known to handle well.\nWhat do you expect lies ahead for the Foundation in the long run - say, the next ten years?\nDM: My generation is already forming the 'Wikimedia Alumni' - the readers, consumers of our content love us. It is amazing to realize what powers they may have in the next ten years, and how they will be able to assist us.\nThe biggest work to be done - maintaining the loyalty of our community, continue being the good guys of the Internet. Next ten years will be years of continued Internet penetration, and us being the major beneficial part of that process is especially exciting.\nI really want to believe, that our offline activities will be just an intermediate step, and we will have whole world using our online resources, and of course - contributing to them.\nAlso, I'm not sure if we will be capable to achieve in next ten years, but besides digital divide, we will have to break information isolationism that certain countries or communities maintain - and the best way to achieve it is by providing the best knowledge resource possible.

The organizers of the demonstration expect at least two-hundred participants, with representatives of the digital rights organization Electronic Frontier Finland (Effi) and several political parties will also present. \nThe controversy arose after the Finnish National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) blacklisted censorship critic Matti Nikki's site. Matti Nikki himself is now under criminal investigation for aiding in the distribution of child pornography, as he published a large portion of the filtering blacklist on his still-censored website. MP Jyrki Kasvi has made an official inquiry in the Finnish Parliament on the matter, and Effi has filed an official complaint to the parliamentary ombudsman. \nThe Finnish Minister of Communication, Suvi Lind\u00e9n, and the NBI have been severely criticized over the filtering system, which has been under heavy scrutiny by the media. After stating that she will not tolerate discussion criticizing the filtering system, as the situation is \"not a matter of freedom of speech\", a petition was signed by over 12,000 people demanding her resignation. This was accompanied by a Thai civil rights group questioning the blocking as child porn of a memorial site dedicated to a member of the Thai royal family. Eventually the NBI removed the memorial site from the blacklist, explaining that the DNS based system blocks only whole sites, and that there was child pornography site under the same domain; this raised questions about the efficiency of the filtering system.\nLind\u00e9n later admitted that she did not know the details of the filtering system, as it had been established by her predecessors, before the change of government in early 2007. She has nevertheless defended the system, citing the protection of children, but admitted that there are problems with the Finnish system, and in other countries with similar systems. \nThe NBI have published a statement explaining their actions, at the request of Lind\u00e9n. In it the NBI stated that there are filtered sites that do not contain any child pornography, but claimed that it was not their fault, rather a side effect of the system. They also noted that they are planning to address this issue by switching from a DNS based filter to a URL based system. \nAccording to a prominent Finnish expert of filtering technology, the planned URL filtering would cost least two million euros. This estimate comes at the same time that the government cut back funds for work against child abuse, causing further uproar.\nThe NBI's official position is that they block pornographic sites where the actors look too young, and sites which link to these sites. The argument for the filtering is that there is a large amount of child pornography on the Internet, most of it based on servers in countries where the authorities are indifferent to the issue.\nThe general opinion after analysis by multiple people is that the list of at least 1,700 sites contains a handful of actual child pornographic sites, most of which are not located in Western countries. However, some sites in the list are located in countries like the United States, the Netherlands, United Kingdom and Germany, and very few of those contain even questionable or borderline material. Dutch journalist Karin Spaink reviewed 40 sites on the list which were physically located in the Netherlands. She concluded that some of the sites have illegal child pornography, and that four of those are also blocked in the Netherlands by their equivalent filtering system. She estimated that about half of the 40 did not contain any illegal material. \nEffi's response to the NBI's statement was that the issue with censorship is not technical but that it has no place in an open, democratic society.

Oscar Naranjo said evidence from the computers of slain members of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) suggests the Venezuelan government recently paid the militant guerrilla group US$300 million. He suggested that this may have been part of a deal to release several hostages held by the FARC. \n\"This unmasks the relations of the FARC with a series of governments, with a series of personalities, some public, some more sinister,\" Naranjo said. A representative of the Ecuadorian government may have been involved with the organization as well, he says, though Ecuadorian president Rafael Correa has already denied these charges.\n\"They said we had a pact with terrorists, and that is completely false,\" Correa said during a Cabinet meeting. \"We are dealing with an extremely cynical government.\"\nThe police chief also said there was evidence of the Venezuelan government offering to help supply rifles and of 50 kilograms of uranium to FARC. To verify the evidence, the police chief said he will send the documents to the Organization of American States, who will meet in Washington on Tuesday to discuss the South American situation. \nIn addition, he says there is evidence that FARC had given U$150,000 to Hugo Ch\u00e1vez in 1992 when he was a jailed rebel leader. \"A note recovered from Ra\u00fal Reyes speaks of how grateful Ch\u00e1vez was for the 100 million pesos that the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, delivered to Ch\u00e1vez when he was in prison,\" Naranjo said. \nColombia, Venezuela and Ecuador are involved in a conflict over the killing on Saturday of FARC spokesman Luis Edgar Devia Silva, also known as Ra\u00fal Reyes. Colombian security forces conducted a raid that extended into Ecuadorian territory.\nVenezuela and Ecuador have ordered troops to the border with Colombia and have pulled their diplomats from the capital Bogota.\n\"We will not permit this outrage,\" said Rafael Correa. \"The situation is extremely grave, and the Ecuadoran government is disposed to go to the ultimate consequences.\" President of Venezuela Hugo Ch\u00e1vez said the act was a \"cowardly murder\" and insulted Colombian President Alvaro Uribe as a liar, criminal and gangster.\nColombia says it has decided not to send extra troops to its borders or sever diplomatic ties with either of the two countries, Uribe said that his fight was against FARC and not any of these countries."}

He originally announced he would govern for his full term till 2011.\nPaisley plans to step down after an investment conference in May organized by the power-sharing Northern Ireland Executive.\nPaisley told reporters, \"I could go on and on but I've decided to go, I came to this decision a few weeks ago when I was thinking very much about the conference and what was going to come after the conference, I thought that it is a marker, a very big marker, and it would be a very appropriate time for me to bow out.\" Paisley noted he is not fully retiring as he will remain on the back benches at Stormont, the location of the Northern Ireland Assembly.\nPaisley has been a controversial, divisive figure in Northern Ireland politics throughout his five decades of involvement. Until his acceptance of the First Minister position with political rival and enemy and Sinn Fein's Martin McGuinness, a former IRA commander, Paisley was nicknamed Dr. No for his refusal to grant any concessions to the Irish nationalists or republicans and his working with McGuinness would have been unheard of ten years ago.\nHis announcement is believed to be in part because of this relationship with McGuinness, the two political rivals were photographed together enjoying a laugh, earning them the nickname, the \"Chuckle Brothers.\" \nHard-line factions within the DUP are not happy with Paisley sharing power with Sinn Fein, which they see as inextricably linked to the Provisional Irish Republican Army. Paisley used to refer to the party in political discourse as \"Sinn Fein/IRA.\"\nPaisley is known for fundamentalist anti-Catholic views and stances and helped to form the Free Presbyterian Church of Ulster in 1951 as part of a disagreement between a local church in Crossgar, County Down and the elders of the county church governance. Paisley was forced to retire in January due to his political role as First Minister and possibly, his power-sharing with Sinn Fein.\nThe announcement comes one month before the tenth anniversary of Good Friday Agreement which ended the thirty year-long period of conflict know as the \"The Troubles\" in which violence occurred between the nationalist and republican and the unionist and loyalist communities of Northern Ireland in the form of bombings, assassinations and gang violence.\nIt also comes a month after Ian Paisley's son, Ian Paisley Jr resigned after accusations and criticism over links with property developer, Seymour Sweeney and controversy over lobbying. Paisley Junior noted today that he was transferring of the ownership of the firm which runs his constituency office in Ballymena to a representative of a north Antrim DUP branch.\nPeter Robinson, the deputy leader and Northern Ireland Finance Minister is the likely choice to succeed Paisley, but some sources with in the party would not discount Northern Ireland Finance Minister Nigel Dodds either.\nPaisley's reaction to choosing his succesor was, \"This is not the Church of Rome. This is not Apostolic succession and I have no right to say who will succeed me.\"\nReaction.\nBritish Prime Minister Gordon Brown noted, \"Ian Paisley has made a huge contribution to political life in Northern Ireland and the United Kingdom. The whole country values and admires the manner in which he has led as First Minister.\"\n\"His commitment and dedication to public service deserve our gratitude. Progress on bringing a lasting peace to Northern Ireland would not have been possible without his immense courage and leadership.\"\nIrish Taoiseach Bertie Ahern also gave his feelings on Paisley, \"The announcement by Dr Ian Paisley that he will step down from the post of First Minister is a watershed in the history of Ireland. He is a giant figure in the history of these islands. In recent years, I have grown to know Dr. Paisley and have valued the practical and friendly working relationship that developed between us. I respect him as a man who worked tirelessly for the people he represents and who has sincerely done what he believed was right.\"\nTony Blair, the former British Prime Minister who was instrumental in restarting devolution said, \"Ian Paisley's contribution to peace, after all the years of division and difference was decisive and determinative. In short, in the final analysis, he made it happen. The man famous for saying 'no' will go down in history for saying 'yes'.\"\nMartin McGuinness, the Deputy First Minister gave his reaction, \"Ian Paisley has played a very powerful role in the course of the politics of the north of Ireland and the island of Ireland. The historic decision he took to go into government with Sinn Fein has changed the face of Irish politics forever. I think that he will be fondly remembered by the people of Ireland - north and south - for the very courageous leadership that he showed.\"\nPeter Robinson, Paisley's deputy said of his leader, \"When violent Republicans tried to destabilize and destroy our province and force us into a United Ireland, Dr. Paisley led the Unionist population in opposition to their objectives.\" \nRobinson further added, \"The DUP and indeed Northern Ireland will forever be indebted to Dr. Paisley for his contribution. He is truly a Unionist colossus and he can be justifiably proud that today Unionist politics and Northern Ireland's position within the Union are stronger than at any point during his extraordinary career.\"\nMark Durkan, the leader of the nationalist Social Democratic and Labour Party noted, \"While this is very significant political news, there is responsibility on all of us as politicians to make the most of the political processes here no matter who comes or goes. In particular, we have to make a success of the investment conference in May and not allow this story to distort or distract from this focus.\" \nDavid Ford, the leader of the Alliance Party of Northern Ireland also noted, \"History will judge whether Ian Paisley will be remembered for 40 years of saying no or one year of saying probably. Many will say his road to Damascus conversion came 35 years too late. The achievements of the executive since last May have been modest in the extreme.\"\nPeter Hain, the former Secretary of State for Northern Ireland gave his response, \"He played an absolutely historic role in ending the deadlock and establishing permanent devolved government and deserves enormous credit for the courage and vision he showed.\"\nJim Allister, a former DUP member who resigned over the power-sharing agreement with Sinn Fein and formed his own party, the Traditional Unionist Voice, gave his word, \"It has been quite clear for some time that Ian Paisley was going to be hung out to dry by the DUP pragmatists. He had served his purpose. He had delivered what they had devised, but couldn't sell themselves - government with unrepentant terrorists.\" "}

The officer responded that there had been \"no trouble, just people walking back and forth.\" Most the protest consisted of protesters handing out information pamphlets, DVDs, viral marketing cards for their campaign, talking to pedestrians who were passing by, shouting to one another and shouting various chants.\nSome Anonymous put forward concerns about Scientology plants in the crowd trying to incite disruption, however, none was noted. Other protesters mentioned there were rumors that the Scientologists were going to bus in Scientology students to disrupt the protester, however, that did not occur. \nScientologists were outside taking photos of the protesters, unlike February 10th, where they remained inside and photographing from the building. The Wikinews reporter asked a Scientologist why he taking pictures, he took the reporter's photograph and noted that he \"was just taking pictures.\" Wikinews asked a church member if he would like to give a statement to Wikinews on camera, they denied the request and told the reporter they would send a statement via email to him. However, Wikinews has not yet received a statement from the Boston church.\nBoston Galleries\nOther Boston galleries\n, Belgium.\nStarting off from a meeting point at the , the anonymous protesters proceeded on foot to arrive at their licensed protest point outside the around 12:30 local time. The turnout was about half that of the previous protest with only 20 or so people present.\nPer advice from the police, cake was not on offer. It had been pointed out that this would likely get the protesters overrun by children and vagrants. Unlike other countries, Belgium has laws prohibiting protesters to cover their faces, leaving the protesters to wear sunglasses and shawls.\nThe protest could not take place in front of Scientology's headquarters because an E.U. summit was scheduled to continue until today. Scientology members were allowed to be active outside their headquarters, for their \"open door day\". No special activities inside their building was observed, just volunteers handing out flyers to perhaps a dozen passers-by. The press release for this open door day was devoted to Anonymous: \nThe Scientologists said the event was inspired by the , which is however remembered on December 10 (also mentioned on the flags outside their office, see photo). The was established on March 15 (2006), a date closer to this weekend.\n\"Wikinews\" spoke to a Scientology representative in the European headquarters, which are located in the political heart of Brussels; \"Law Street\", just next to the Belgian and European parliament. Since Scientology was devoting the afternoon to human rights, we asked for Scientology's opinion about human rights controversies in the United States (such as the detainees). The representative told \"Wikinews\" that the Church is a religious movement and avoids taking general political stances.\nThe representative was also confident about the outcome of a pending lawsuit from the Belgian federal prosecutor. After an eight-year investigation, the Belgian justice said that the local and European chapters, as well as, members would be accused of blackmailing, swindling members, breaking trade and privacy laws, unlawfully practising medicine, and forming a criminal organisation.\n\"The file is empty,\" said the Scientology representative, who asserted that the inquiry had been so lengthy because the state could not prove any wrongdoings by the Church. He said that unlike in the US, Scientology is not seeking official recognition in Belgium, which recognises only six religions. He also claimed that there were more than 1,000 Scientologists in Belgium.\nAnonymous distributed flyers and informed passers-by about Scientology. In a speech, they called for a dialogue with Scientology members, and said they were concerned for the parishioners' well-being:\n\"Operation: Party Hard - expect us, with cake\" was closed off with a birthday cake for the protesters.\nBelgian media were in attendance with a film crew from interviewing several of the protesters and capturing their banners on tape. The slogans were mostly in English, ranging from \"\"Religion is free, Scientology isn't\" to \"One billion years of servitude = super powers\"\" \u2014 the latter a reference to the contracts that Scientologists sign when they become involved with the church's .\nThe police presence was low-key with only one senior officer and a member of the who took photographs.\nBrussels Gallery\nLondon, England.\nOnce more, protests took place outside of both the Queen Victoria Scientology Headquarters and the Tottenham Court Road Dianetics centre. The additional time available for protesters in the aftermath of a rushed February 10th protest allowed the many of Anonymous to expand their protest to include even more outreach towards members of the public, with Anonymous members handing out free cake, sweets and other confectionery along with leaflets and stickers to passers-by.\nSignage was loud and varied, proclaiming a variety of messages to the public and Scientologists. Many of the signs declared amusing yet pointed comments, with others making more serious jabs at the Church of Scientology.\nDespite a larger police presence at the Tottenham Court Road protest, the protesters and Scientologists were both peaceful. Police officers, when asked if they had had any problems with the protesters, replied, somewhat jovially, \"I can't really speak to you, the only thing I can say is 'No comment'. No problems. I mean no comment.\"\nInterview\nThis interview was carried out with members of Anonymous at the Tottenham Court Road protest. Church of Scientology representatives refused an interview and have not made any comment at the time of going to press.\nReporters also spoke with members of the police:\nLondon Gallery\n, England.\nThe protest started at approximately 11:00 local time with protesters saying that over 100 people have turned up to protest for at least part of the protest. It started at Deansgate, which is the same location as the one for the start of the February 10 protests. Members of Anonymous have told \"Wikinews\" that their members started arriving at 09:00 local time.\nProtesters were holding placards with statements such as \u201cFreedom of religion - A right / Freedom to oppress - A crime.\u201d Placards asking \u201cHow do I anger seasoned Amnesty International prize winning journalist, John Sweeney?\u201d were also held as part of the protest. John Sweeney was heavily featured in the UK press after he produced a documentary in which he claimed representatives of the Church of Scientology were constantly following him.\nAs with the other protests, protesters brought cake, as a result of it being close to the birthday of L. Ron Hubbard, founder of Scientology. \nOne of the protesters told \"Wikinews\" that \u201cThe so-called Church of Scientology's multiple violations of the U.N.'s Universal Declaration on Human Rights have gone unnoticed and unchallenged for far too long.\u201d He continued saying that \u201cthe corporation needs to learn that suppression of free speech, institution of forced labour and the more general suppression of its parishioners is both legally and morally wrong. The protests will continue until such a time that major changes are made to the Scientology's organizational structure, or until they meet accusations of wrongdoing head-on and provide evidence that the community's worries are unfounded.\u201d He added that he was \u201cnot protesting against the religion of Scientology, but the corporation that delivers it.\u201d &lt;/br&gt;\nInterview&lt;/br&gt;\nThis interview was carried out yesterday with two of the Manchester protesters. \nManchester Gallery&lt;/br&gt;\n, New York.\nThroughout the day, nearly 100 protesters including ex-Sea Org Scientology member Chuck Beatty, turned out in Buffalo with signs and enthusiasm. It was a cold and foggy day with temperatures in the low 30's (F) which is significantly warmer than the previous February 10 protests that drew only about 50 people. People filled Main Street across from the Church in a line which extended an entire city block. A radio was on hand playing 'Rick Roll' and also the audio recording of the Scientology interview with .\nThe day started off with an off duty Buffalo Police detective instructing the crowd to protest peacefully. The detective, who was identified to Wikinews only as 'Detective Tim' then immediately told protesters to remove masks that could be considered threatening. Scarves were allowed as it was a cold day, but bandannas were not permitted to be worn.\n\"Wikinews\" was earlier accused of being \"fake\" and Detective 'Tim' refused to give a statement to Wikinews saying \"no media. You made that (press badge) from the Internet. I never seen this site before.\" 'Tim' then refused outright to give his last name and badge number. 'Tim' was quoted only during his time speaking publicly to the protesters.\nShortly after instructing people to remove masks, 'Tim' then accused a member of Anonymous of \"portraying an terrorist\" because of a scarf he was wearing and asked him to remove it.\nShortly after, at least three protesters were detained by police and questioned after taking photographs and video of the Church from across the street. Police approached the three and began to \"yell\" at them. 'Tim' then told one protester that \"the Church want you arrested. Now how am I going to avoid that.\" The protester then willingly handed over his videotape of the church and asked not to be arrested. Subsequently all three were released without being charged. According to Detective 'Tim', \"the tape is now the property of the police.\" The protesters were not on Church property and were only filming the areas of the Church visible from across the streets.\nDuring the protest, a member of Anonymous read a speech, which according to him, was a worldwide speech to all Churches.\n\"Today - The Ides of March - is the day Julius Caesar was betrayed by those he trusted. Today we gather together as Anonymous to call attention to another betrayal of trust - that of the Church of Scientology upon its followers. Since is inception, Scientology has traded in false hopes and promises, betrayed the trust of its members, taken their money, their rights, and at times their very lives,\" said the statement.\n\"Last month 10,000 people demonstrated in one hundred and seven cities across the world. They came together to make the first breach in the wall of silence,\" added the statement.\nDespite the incident, 'Tim' was friendly to the protesters, even stating that \"he might be back later to have a few cupcakes.\"\nAccording to a member of Anonymous, \"we will come again, our numbers ever increasing, in April, May, June and July.\"\nBuffalo Gallery\n, Washington.\nThe Seattle protest was divided into two halves. One group was to assemble at , and would march from there to the Scientology site. The other group was to meet at the Seattle Center, closer to the site, disseminating fliers to the crowd.\nProtesters began to gather in front of Westlake Center at about 9:30 PDT. with about a dozen protesters at first. One of the protesters revealed to me that he was a 30 year former member of the Church of Scientology from the Los Angeles area. He asserted that \"this protest is just.\" He spoke of former members who have been afraid to come out, because of the continuously reinforced teachings of the church. Members are cautioned against looking onto the Internet for alternate information, that they could die if they were to even look at the Internet. The mind is trained not to seek out any information that could contradict the church's teachings. He said that if the Scientologists ever knew what really happens in the church management, they would be terrified, and turn away in droves.\nOther members carried picket signs and leaflets. Early on, many of the crowd members were chatting with each other, sometimes taking pictures of each other. Passers by gave the assembled crowd mixed reactions to being approached. One of the members of the public expressed concern that a protest in Seattle would not do much, \"They oughta be picketing Tom Cruise's house.\" \nCuriously, a few members actually took pictures of me standing off to the side with my camera. A few accused me of being from the church, attempting to gain identifiable information, and were therefore cautious. Others saw me as the only person around without a mask, and in this crowd I was the outsider.\nAt about 11:00 PDT, the crowd started to proceed north, up 5th Avenue in downtown Seattle. At no point did I witness any of the Anonymous group committing a crime. I however, could probably have been cited on multiple counts for jaywalking, in attempts to get a decently framed shot from my digital camera without being seen as marching with the crowd. Numerous car horns blared during the crowd's exodus down 5th Avenue. As the street took a turn north, the crowd passed Fischer Plaza, home to local ABC affiliate KOMO-TV. I noted that I had not seen any mainstream media coverage of the event. The march turned down Broad Street, and at this point I gave up trying to keep pace in front of the crowd. I pulled over to the side of the sidewalk, next to a chain link fence to get the last photos of this phase of the protest. Afterwards, I followed the procession as it turned onto Aurora, and reached the Scientology center.\nThe center itself is situated on one end of an overpass, Aurora Avenue crosses over Mercer Street here, and eastbound traffic on Mercer was treated to a large banner proclaiming \"HONK AGAINST SCIENTOLOGY\" The banner generated a considerable number of car horns, which resulted in an equal number of cheers from the crowd. On the north side of the center, more protesters positioned themselves around the parking lot. Very few members were visible, for a long time there was only one standing near the entrance back in a fenced off area. Members of the crowd would level jeers at the man, such as \"What are your crimes?\" Eventually two police officers arrived, who stationed themselves in the parking lot, observing the crowd and calmly turning back any protester who crossed into the parking lot with a warning. No Scientology personnel approached the crowd, or a member of the press.\nSeattle Gallery\nSydney, Australia.\nThe protest in Sydney gathered approximately 300 activists. The masked protesters gathered in Hyde Park and moved through the city to the Church of Scientology. Two large trucks obstructed the view of the Scientology office from across the street.\nSydney Gallery\n, Oregon.\nThe protesting began at 10:30, and was quieter than the 10 February event, with about 100 protesters. Initially, all of the protesters were on the side of the street opposing the church, but later someone suggested loudly to cross over and soon both sides of the street had protesters, many right in front of the church. The protesters walked through the middle of the road, contrary to guidelines stated for the 10 February protest. This resulted in some booing from the protesters that didn't cross.\nPolice showed up at one point, and asked a few protesters (walking right through them) to clear a driveway.\nPortland Gallery"}

At a rate of more than 300,000 gallons of water per second, the flood could fill up the 102-story Empire State Building in 20 minutes, said Interior Secretary Dirk Kempthorne.\n\"This gives you a glimpse of what nature has been doing for millions of years, cutting through and creating this magnificent canyon,\" Kempthorne said after pulling the lever that released the water. The flood will continue for 60 hours, during which time the flow of water from the dam is expected to increase by four or five times.\nAfter the dam was built in 1963, the seasonal floods that would spread sediment throughout the river were halted. This sediment was necessary for creating sandbars and beaches, which served as wildlife habitats. As a result, two fish species have become extinct, and two others have become endangered, including the humpback chub. Although the water level will only rise a few feet after the flood, officials are hoping it will be enough to restore eroded sandbars downstream. \nScientists will be conducting studies on how the flooding affects the native species and their habitats. \"Our ultimate purpose is to learn whether or not this is a viable strategy for creating sandbars and habitats for native fish,\" said John Hamill, chief of the Grand Canyon Monitoring and Research Center.\nSimilar experiments were conducted in 1996 and 2004, although Randall Peterson, an environmental manager for the Bureau of Reclamation, says, \"Those conditions were markedly different.\" He says that tributaries below the dam have released high volumes of sediment in recent years, making conditions more favorable.\nHowever, environmentalists from the Grand Canyon Trust, which has often criticized the government's management of the dam, say there is more that can be done. They assert that the floods must occur regularly if any real change is to be expected, and they accuse the government of conducting the experiment for show. \"They're trying to make it appear that they're doing something beneficial when they're just doing it for appearances,\" said Nikolai Lash, senior program director for the Trust. \"It's being manipulated to be a 'one and done,' even though we know that doesn't work.\"\nGrand Canyon National Park superintendent Steve Martin also raised concerns about the project. He said that not following up with more floods soon could actually destroy habitats rather than restoring them. Though the federal plan calls for smaller annual flows in autumn, Martin says these were timed to serve the interests of hydroelectric power producers. \n\"The best time to get the most money for your hydropower is during peak energy demands, which is generally daytime hours and generally in the summer,\" Martin said. The U.S. Geological Survey acknowledged that the timing was partly designed in order to maximize electricity production during peak demand.\nMeanwhile, others are simply unhappy with the arguing and indecision that have plagued the issue. Martha Hahn, science center director at the national park, said, \"At some point we're going to have to draw a line in the sand and say this is the best way to manage the dam and manage resources in the Grand Canyon. We can't continue to go on and on just researching. We have to make a decision. We really are losing valuable resources.\""}

However, they do not want McCain to appear too often at the side of President Bush.

But I don't think I want to, and that's what it really comes down to,\" the 38-year-old Favre said.\nFavre, who officially retired on Tuesday, dressed for the hour-long event in an untucked button-down shirt, blue jeans, and days worth of stubble. \"It is on my terms, which is a good way to go out,\" he said of his attire. He thanked the Green Bay Packers' organization, his family, and his fans for their support throughout his career, but reluctantly admitted it was time to move on. \n\"I\u2019ve given everything I can possibly give to this organization and I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve got anything left to give,\" he said, as tears welled up in his eyes. \"What matters is it\u2019s been a great career for me. It\u2019s over. As hard as it is for me to say, it\u2019s over.\"\nHis retirement came as somewhat of a surprise to the Packers, who expected he would return for another year. Favre refuted the notion that the Packers did not do enough to get him to return, and assured the organization that nothing they could have done would have affected his decision. \n\"I know there's been comments and issues in the press lately about why I'm leaving, whether or not the Packers did enough, whether or not Ted or (coach) Mike (McCarthy) convinced me to stay,\" Favre said. \"None of those things have anything to do with me retiring, and that's from the heart.\"\nHe instead offered a simpler reason for his departure: the stress of the job was getting to be too much \"I don't think it would get easier next year or the following year,\" he said. \"It hasn't up until this point. It's only gotten tougher and something told me 'You know it's gotten too hard for you.'\"\nWhen asked about his future plans, he replied, \"Nothing.\" This is a new phase in his life, he explained. \"I am going to stick to that until I want to do something else.\" He and his wife, Deanna, said they will be putting all public events on hold for a year, because, as Deanna said, \"Honestly, we both are really tired.\" He says they will still be involved with charities in the future, but not as extensively as before.\nFavre holds NFL records in most wins by a starting quarterback, most passing yards, most passing touchdowns and most consecutive games started. However, he says that \"the statistics part wasn't that important. I was never really a statistics guy. I hope my legacy is a lot more than that.\"\nIn 2007, he led the Packers to a 13-3 season, but lost in the NFC championship game to the eventual champion New York Giants. The final pass of his career was an interception that resulted in the Giants' game-winning field goal. Still, Favre believes he is \"going out on top\", and he could \"care less what other people think\". \n\"One play, one game, one season, doesn't define me,\" he said. \"It has been a wonderful career.\""}

She was first elected to the House of Representatives in 1992 and held her seat for ten years until being defeated by Denise Majette in 2002. She was the first ever African American woman from her state to be elected to Congress.\nWe asked her why she made the recent switch to the Green Party. She replied, \"Due to the importance of environmental issues, Green issues are the issues of today. The Ten Key Values of\nthe Green Party stress us getting along with each other in harmony with the planet that gives us life.\"\nWhen asked about how she would handle Iraq she replied, \"I would instruct the Joint Chiefs to draw up a plan for the orderly withdrawal of all U.S. troops from the country. I would dismantle our military bases in the area, and I would also demand that U.S. and\nother international corporations relinquish any claims to Iraqi oil or\nother resources and withdraw as well.\"\nMcKinney is running for president because, basically, she thinks that \"it's time that the people win\".\nInterview.\nWhy are you running for president?\nCongresswoman McKinney: It is clear that the country needs an additional political party that is not beholden to special interests or corporate lobbyists. Just 5% of the electorate, voting for a third party candidate gets the nation just that. Therefore, for those who are tired of the ability of special interests and corporate interests to subvert the will of the people, their values, or change their policy makers,winning the 5% is the best way to infuse structural change into our political system.\nA victory for the Green Party in this election is possible and necessary. The alternative we present will appeal to the large numbers of disfranchised voters who do not see the major party candidates addressing their issues. In order for a democratic government to work in the public interest, it has to be both transparent and accountable. If 5% vote Green, it will put a third chair at the table of American politics, and it will open the door to the people to see what is going on inside the two-party system that has become controlled by corporations and the expanding power of a military, industrial, and intelligence complex that President Eisenhower warned of in 1960. The Green Party will represent the voices of the majority of diverse and disfranchized voters and citizens and will directly and effectively address their issues.\nI spent my birthday last year protesting in front of the Pentagon. At that rally, I stated that upon winning a majority of the seats in the Congress, the Democratic representatives should have repealed the Bush tax cuts, repealed the Patriot Act, the Secret Evidence Act, and the Military Tribunals Act. And that the majority in Congress should have voted a livable wage for America's workers. And that someone should be trying to locate the $2.3 trillion lost by the Pentagon to pay instead for jobs, health care, and education. I was saddened by the Democratic majority's failure to stop funding the war, and declared my own independence from a national leadership that gave us war crimes, torture, and crimes against humanity. Unfortunately, there is not a major party candidate in the race that has not voted to fund this war. And that vote to fund what is clearly an immoral and illegal war is a vote of complicity in the torture and war crimes that are being committed as part of this war.\nThe deep economic morass which is facing our country today is not being adequately addressed. We are witnessing, through the sub-prime mortgage crisis, the greatest wealth transfer in our history from Black and Latino households. Yet, while they are being asked to tighten their belts, the CEOs of the banks that caused this crisis are reaping maximum pay. Even the solutions proposed by the major candidates focus on using taxpayers' funds to reimburse the banks instead of funding alternative refinancing in the poorest communities. It is clear that in this scenario, the banks always win.\nWell, I think it's time that the people win. Our children shouldn't have to graduate from college one hundred thousand dollars in debt. That is a policy choice made by public policy makers. We don't have to have 48 million Americans without access to health insurance, and even more who are under-insured. Our Congress doesn't have to authorize an increase in national borrowing to nearly $10 trillion shrouded in secrecy. This country should not have racial disparity gaps wider now than at the time of the murder of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. But these are the facts about conditions that Americans are forced to live through every day. Sadly, our policy makers would rather have our country spend $720 million a day on war. Just imagine what that amount could buy in a single payer health care system, education subsidies from Head Start to university, or green technology home conversions and sustainable, safe and non-polluting energy sources.\nPolitics can change things. I have seen that in my lifetime. But we must have policy makers committed to the kind of public policy that reflects our values and those policy makers must be more than marionettes whose strings are pulled by forces not seen or understood by the voters. Those are some of the compelling reasons why I chose to leave the Democratic Party after many years and to run for President on the Green Party ticket.\nYou were a Democrat until not too long ago. Why the switch to the Green Party?\nCongresswoman McKinney: The Green Party is an international party that makes policy in other countries in the world. Due to the importance of environmental issues, Green issues are the issues of today. The Ten Key Values of the Green Party stress us getting along with each other in harmony with the planet that gives us life. We need to get along with each other, and we need to respect our environment.\nThe Green Party also is not constrained in its policy positions by considerations of large corporate donors because the Green Party is supported by individuals who share its values, not large donors intent on gaining concessions at the expense of the people and the U.S. national interest.\nIf elected, how would you handle Iraq?\nCongresswoman McKinney: I would instruct the Joint Chiefs to draw up a plan for the orderly withdrawal of all U.S. troops from the country. I would dismantle our military bases in the area, and I would also demand that U.S. and other international corporations relinquish any claims to Iraqi oil or other resources and withdraw as well. I would encourage the Iraqi people to select their own leaders through the ballot box with assistance from the best minds in the universities region and in the world, in very much the same way that the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa was written. I would support the establishment of a Truth and Reconciliation Commission to inaugurate a just peace and I would deploy a Peace Corps to the country that would work in concert with the reconstruction needs of the Iraqi people and their leadership.\nI would go further than Iraq. I would deconstruct AFRICOM, the new continent-wide U.S. military command set up in Africa, to show the world that the United States has more to share with it than its military might, destabilizing covert operations, nukes, bombs, and missiles. I would work with the Congress to make sure that the face of U.S. engagement with the world is not a military one.\nHow would you handle abortion?\nCongresswoman McKinney: I would not change Roe v. Wade, I would protect and expand women's reproductive rights, and I would work with Congress to bolster family planning and protection against sexually transmitted diseases here and abroad. I would also support better sex education in our schools and community centers, as well as making safe and healthy preventive measures available through heath care providers and community programs to reduce unwanted pregnancies and the spread of HIV/AIDS. Many factors come into any woman's decision to get pregnant or have an abortion. We are still missing effective policies to insure safe, affordable and effective birth control for both genders, programs that support education and employment for single parents, courts that insure child support payments, and available health care through pregnancy and childbirth, and for children.\nThere are thousands reading this right now. What could you say to convince them to give you their vote?\nCongresswoman McKinney: People in Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Ecuador, Haiti, India, Italy, Nicaragua, and Spain decided that even during their deepest national tragedies, they would vote their values, their dreams, and their aspirations. The governments that resulted were not just face-changes, but were governments reflective of the people's deep longing for real change. As a result, policies are being offered and implemented that reflect the truest values of the people--they want to enjoy peace and the right of self-determnination.\nI believe in the good that our government can do to respect civil liberties, the dignity of work, restorative justice (not just incarceration for profit), and peace. I believe that whoever wins the general election right now, \"[sic]\", Hillary Clinton or John McCain, the people will still need a third party with standing to keep them accountable. But to achieve these goals, 5% of us are going to have to do something we've never done before in order to have something we've never had before. I am taking a stand for justice and for peace. I hope others willing to step outside of the two-party paradigm will join me in an effort to make the structural change in the political system that our country so urgently needs."}

Watson, captain of the Sea Shepherd ship the \"Steve Irwin\", stated that his crew had been throwing stink bombs at the sailors, but that they responded with gunfire and flash grenades. \nWatson said he was hit in the chest and found a bullet in the ballistic vest he was wearing. Watson told Australian radio: \"It bruised my shoulder but it would have hit my heart if I didn't have the vest\". He says one of his crew members received minor injuries after being hit by a flash grenade. \"News Limited\" reported that Ralph Lowe, 33, had a bruised back from a flash grenade that exploded behind him, and that Ashley Dunn, 35, received a hip injury while trying to get away from an explosion. David Page, the ship's doctor, was filmed by the Sea Shepherd group prying a bullet from Watsons's Kevlar vest, and said \"You have been hit by a bullet\".\nTokyo denied Watson's account, stating that \"warning devices\" were thrown after their ship had been attacked. Japan's foreign ministry said that their coastguard on the \"Nisshin Maru\" threw a baseball-sized device which exploded near the protesters' ship and emitted a loud sound, and was not designed to cause harm to anyone. Glenn Inwood, spokesman for the Japanese whalers, told ABC Radio: \"Any claim from Paul Watson that he was fired at with a gun and has a bullet lodged in his bulletproof vest is absolutely false.\" Inwood stated there had been \"retaliation\" when the Japanese coast guards fired warning balls at the \"Steve Irwin\".\nAustralian Foreign Minister Stephen Smith released a statement regarding information he received from Japanese officials: \"Japanese officials have now advised the Australian embassy in Tokyo that during the incident in the Southern Ocean this afternoon, three warning balls \u2014 also known as flashbangs \u2014 had been fired ... Japanese officials have advised that these devices are designed to make a loud noise but not to injure, and that no gunshots had been fired.\" Japan also told the Australian Embassy that one of the crew members of the \"Nisshin Maru\" had fired a warning shot in the air. Smith stated: \"I absolutely condemn actions by crew members of any vessel that cause injury \u2013 or have the potential to cause injury \u2014 to anyone on the high seas ... The Australian Government once again calls on all parties in the Southern Ocean \u2014 including all protest and whaling vessels, and their respective crews \u2013 to exercise restraint.\"\nWatson explained to Australia's ABC News that the Japanese whalers had no reason to fire on the protesters: \"We were doing what we usually do, which is putting stink bombs on deck ... We go out of our way to make sure we don't throw them near anybody, but they were throwing the flash grenades directly at us.\" If Watson's statements are proven to be true, the actions of the Japanese saliors represents a breach of international law. \nJapan claimed that four crew members of the \"Nisshin Maru\" were injured in the confrontation, but Watson denied this. Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Nobutaka Machimura criticized the Sea Shepherd group in a statement to reporters: \"They have repeatedly resorted to such activities and it is truly unforgivable ... Is it all right to hurt humans in order to protect whales? I think whales are cute and important creatures, but even so, hurting humans is unforgivable.\" \nEarlier this week, Sea Shepherd protesters clashed with the \"Nisshin Maru\", and threw stink bombs and \"slippery\" powder at the Japanese ship. Two Sea Shepherd protesters were taken hostage in January after they boarded a Japanese harpoon ship, the \"Yushin Maru No. 2\", and Australia later brokered their release. Protesters have been following the \"Nisshin Maru\" since Japan began its annual hunt for whales in the Southern Ocean in December. \nBoth New Zealand and Australia have led international protests against the hunting of whales. Last month Australia released film of whale slaughter taken from its customs ship, the \"Oceanic Viking\", and said the footage could be used in a potential international legal challenge to Japan's whaling activities. Due to a loophole in a 1986 global moratorium on whaling that allows \"lethal research\" on whales, Japan kills up to 1,000 of the mammals per year."}

Molossia is a micronation or entity that resembles an independent nation but which is unrecognized by world governments or major international organisations.\nMolossia is situated on several acres of land in western Nevada, within driving distance of Reno. Unlike most of today's micronations, Molossia allows visitors and has its own economy. It also has its own time zone and holidays as well as a few tourist attractions.\nPresident Baugh said of his country, \"Molossia is unique among\nmicronations in that we possess actual land, real terra firma upon which we\nstake our national claim. Most micronations only exist on the internet and\ndon't have land. We are quite proud of our little country, and display all\nthe trappings of a full-fledged nation, including our flag, boundary\nmarkers, signs, a couple of small tourist attractions and so forth, as well\nas our own money, stamps, national anthem, navy and even a space program...Our goal is to exercise complete sovereignty over our country without annoying the United States.\" \nThe United States recognizes the territory claimed by Molossia as part of the United States and exercises the same dominion over it as it does over any other part of the country.\nInterview.\nTell us about your country. Why was it started? How long has it been in existence? Do you have a flag, national anthem or currency? Can one become a citizen?\nPresident Baugh: Molossia is a micronation, a self-declared and largely unrecognized country, one of dozens throughout the world. Molossia is unique among micronations in that we possess actual land, real terra firma upon which we stake our national claim. Most micronations only exist on the internet and don't have land. We are quite proud of our little country, and display all the trappings of a full-fledged nation, including our flag, boundary markers, signs, a couple of small tourist attractions and so forth, as well as our own money, stamps, national anthem, navy and even a space program. Molossia was founded in 1977 as the Grand Republic of Vuldstein. The name has changed since then, but the idea is the same - to have our own small country. We were intrigued and inspired by the movie \"The Mouse That Roared\", about a tiny country in Europe that declares war against the United States and wins by accident. The humor of that situation was not lost on us, and it spawned the idea that we, too, could have our own tiny nation. Once we obtained land 10 years ago, the idea became more real, that we were now standing in a foreign country, deep inside the United States. Since then, the Molossian experience has only grown stronger and more rewarding and we look forward to a long and interesting future for our little nation.\nAnd to answer the last part, no, not everyone can become a citizen. You have to be a physical resident of Molossia to be a citizen, and we are closed to new immigrants at this time - we just don't have the room!\nToday, there are hundreds of micronations that are little more than online chat groups. Is Molossia a serious micronation?\nPresident Baugh: I would say yes, we are serious. That is to say, serious within limits. Molossia is not a secessionist project. We are not taking up arms to declare independence nor starting an insurrection. However, beyond that, we are quite serious about our country. Our goal is to exercise complete sovereignty over our country without annoying the United States Government too much, and to have a good time doing it.\nMolossia is surrounded by the United States. Do you consider yourself a Molossian or an American? Do you pay U.S. taxes?\nPresident Baugh: I consider myself a dual citizen, both Molossian and American. Molossia is so small that we rely heavily on the US for support, goods, etc., so maintaining US citizenship is certainly desirable. In addition, it's often very difficult to explain that we have our own country out in the Nevada desert, so it's easier just to play both parts, American and Molossian. And yes, we do contribute to the coffers of the US Treasury annually, however, we call it \"foreign aid\". They need it, honestly.\nCan people visit Molossia? Is tourism a vital part of your nation's economy?\nPresident Baugh: Yes, we welcome visitors to our country, although tourism is not a major source of income. In fact, we had 10 tourists visit last year. There are a few sights to see, but a visit usually only lasts about an hour. I escort all visitors around our nation and show them the sights, tell them about Molossia and even serve them cookie dough, our national treat. It's important, though, that visitors do not arrive uninvited. Please contact me first via e-mail and we will agree on a date and time.\nLegally, can Molossia be considered an independent nation?\nPresident Baugh: Honestly, no. It takes a great deal of effort, time, money and especially legal wrangling to become fully independent, and we are nowhere near that point yet. No, we exist in a limbo state, at the good will of the US, and we are fine with that right now. After all, becoming independent can such a messy affair, and that would conflict with our relaxed lifestyle. We are happy to be the \"country just down the road, on the left\"!"}

As a result, Ecuador and their ally Venezuela had sent troops to their borders and severed ties with Colombia.\nAt the summit, Uribe charged Correa's government of having links with the FARC rebels, a charge that Correa quickly denied. \"I cannot accept Uribe's lies,\" he said. \"These hands are not tainted with blood.\" He admitted there had been communication with the FARC, but only regarding the release of hostages held by the rebels, including French-Colombian politician \u00cdngrid Betancourt. \nUribe insisted that Ecuador has not done enough to fight the rebels, which was the reason the operation had to remain a secret, he said. \"We have not gotten cooperation from President Correa in the fight against terrorism.\" Correa then advocated the creation of an international peacekeeping force to control the border, saying that Ecuador has become a victim of the fighting in Colombia.\nVenezuelan president Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, who was initially a central figure in the conflict, urged the leaders to stay calm. \"We still have time to stop a whirlpool which we could regret,\" he said. \"Let's reflect, let's be cool-headed.\" He also denied claims that he had supplied FARC with $300 million and offered to give them rifles. \"I could have sent a lot of rifles to the FARC,\" Ch\u00e1vez said. \"I will never do it because I want peace.\"\nFinally, it was Dominican president Leonel Fernandez plea for peace that ended the feud. He requested that the presidents shake hands with each other, which they did, in a televised gesture viewed live across Latin America. Nicaragua's president, Daniel Ortega, also agreed to reinstate diplomatic ties with Colombia after shaking hands with their president.\nThe leaders at the summit later approved a declaration in which Uribe apologized for the military operation and vowed never again to violate another nation's sovereignty. It also mentioned a commitment to fight against threats posed by \"irregular or criminal groups.\""}

Bush has vetoed a bill that would have banned the Central Intelligence Agency from using harsh interrogation techniques such as waterboarding, he said in his weekly radio address Saturday.\n\"Because the danger remains, we need to ensure our intelligence officials have all the tools they need to stop the terrorists,\" Bush said. \"The bill Congress sent me would take away one of the most valuable tools in the war on terror - the CIA program to detain and question key terrorist leaders and operatives.\"\nThe bill, which passed the House of Representatives in November and the Senate in February despite warnings that it would be vetoed, established guidelines for intelligence activities. One of these guidelines would limit the CIA to only using interrogation methods allowed in the U.S. Army Field Manual. \nThe relevant text of the bill reads:\nAmong the methods prohibited in the manual are stripping prisoners naked, forcing them to perform sexual acts, beating, electrocuting, or burning them, staging mock executions, withholding food and medical attention, and the controversial technique known as waterboarding.\nWaterboarding involves pouring water over a prisoner's cloth-covered face in a simulation of drowning. It is condemned as torture by many nations, human rights groups, and members of Congress.\nAlthough Bush did not specifically mention waterboarding in his address, he did hint to it in some of his statements. \"The bill Congress sent me would not simply ban one particular interrogation method, as some have implied,\" he said. \"Instead, it would eliminate all the alternative procedures we've developed to question the world's most dangerous and violent terrorists.\"\nBush said that the methods used by the military are designed for interrogating \"lawful combatants captured on the battlefield\", not the \"hardened terrorists\" normally questioned by the CIA. \"If we were to shut down this program and restrict the CIA to methods in the Field Manual, we could lose vital information from senior al Qaida terrorists, and that could cost American lives,\" Bush said.\nMassachusetts senator Edward Kennedy described Bush's veto as \"one of the most shameful acts of his presidency\". In a statement released Friday, he said, \"Unless Congress overrides the veto, it will go down in history as a flagrant insult to the rule of law and a serious stain on the good name of America in the eyes of the world.\""}

The spacecraft, named \"Jules Verne\", and also known as ATV-001, has been described as the most advanced ever built in Europe. It will now begin about a month of testing, prior to its scheduled docking with the International Space Station (ISS) in early April. The launch of the ATV marks the culmination of a thirteen-year development programme, and the start of a six-month mission to test the spacecraft and resupply the ISS. Arianespace conducted the launch on behalf of the European Space Agency, who will be responsible for the ATV's operation. A second burn of the upper stage was performed at around 05:06 GMT. Launch operations concluded with spacecraft separation from the carrier rocket at 05:09, and control of the ATV was transferred to the French space agency, CNES, who will control it from a centre in Toulouse. Deployment of the spacecraft's solar arrays was confirmed at around 05:40 GMT.\nThe Ariane 5ES rocket, which was making its maiden flight, lifted off from ELA-3 at the Guiana Space Centre at 04:03:04 GMT this morning. The Ariane 5ES was designed primarily to be used for European government programmes, such as the ATV, and Galileo. It uses the first stage of a heavy-lift Ariane 5ECA, with a restartable upper stage from the Ariane 5GS. It will replace the Ariane 5GS, which is scheduled to retire later this year. It is the first European launch of the year, with the next, using an Ariane 5ECA, scheduled for early April, with Brazillian satellite Star One C2 and Vinasat-1, the first Vietnamese spacecraft. The next ATV is scheduled for launch in late 2009.\nThe ATV will remain in orbit for around six months, before being replaced at the ISS by a smaller Russian Progress spacecraft. When this happens, the ATV will be de-orbited, and will burn up on re-entry. The launch is the culmination of thirteen years of planning and preparation, and the programme is already three years behind schedule. The launch of \"Jules Verne\" had previously been delayed from July, September and November 2007, and from February 2008. A further delay, from Saturday, was caused by a problem with the system that the ATV uses to separate from its carrier rocket. \nSpeaking after the launch, Arianespace chairman Jean-Yves Le Gall remarked that the launch was \"perfect\", and that the launch shows that Europe is a \"major player\" in manned spaceflight. ESA administrator Jean-Jacques Dordain commented that ESA was \"embarking on an extraordinary voyage\", and that \"as of today ESA is an essential partner...of the International Space Station\". He also said that Europe was \"on [its] way to becoming a major partner in the ISS\", and that the successful launch \"would not have been possible the support of ESA's member states\".\nThe ATV's launch comes two days ahead of the scheduled launch of the next mission to visit the Space Station, Space Shuttle \"Endeavour\", which will begin mission STS-123 at 06:28:12 GMT on Tuesday. \"Endeavour\" will deliver the first pressurised section of the Japanese Experiment Module, and the Canadian-built Dextre component for the Space Station's robotic arm.\nSeveral hours after launch, a problem was reported to have developed with the number two Propulsion Drive Electronics (PDE) unit. This is responsible for control over a quarter of the ATV's manoeuvring thrusters. All engine burns have been delayed or cancelled whilst the fault is investigated.\nThis is the eighth orbital launch of 2008. The 20-tonne ATV is the heaviest spacecraft ever launched by a European rocket."}

That's why, after three years of tests with no conclusions, I am in favour of putting the whole thing on ice,\" Blatter explained.\nUEFA president Michel Platini agreed: \"Football should stay human, but two more officials can help, especially around the goal.\" Platini made the suggestion to freeze all investigations into technology and to try two additional assistants behind each goal.\nBlatter said the system using the microchip \"was very complicated, needing electrified lines on the field of play and other devices including antennae and when we tested it in Tokyo last year there was one mistake during the seven matches we used as an experiment at the Club World Championship.\" With regards to the system using cameras, he pointed to \"problems with players obscuring the views of the cameras, or of flares or weather conditions.\"\nThe system of the extra referees will be tested at an upcoming FIFA or UEFA tournament, and a final ruling is expected at next year's meeting, according to FIFA's Jerome Valcke.\nHawk-Eye, the company that was working on the goal-line technology that is already being used for line calls in tennis, reacted with disappointment: \"I'm livid, it is completely out of the blue... A year ago they met and gave us four criteria to meet and we have met all of them, yet they have kicked it out now... We have invested an awful lot of money and now we have no return on that investment,\" director Paul Hawkins said. He said he was encouraged to continue research on the project only 10 days ago at a private showing for IFAB members at Reading's Madejski Stadium.\nWhile the Welsh FA were also against the idea, the English Football Association supported the use of technology and was hoping to start using it by next season. The FA clubs and referees supported the use of Hawk-Eye technology, said Mike Foster, general secretary of the English Premier League. A spokesperson of the Premier League said that \"A lot of time, money and effort has gone into developing a system that meets all the criteria laid down last year.\" The Scottish and Northern Irish FA also voted in favour of the goal-line technology.\nFA chief executive Brian Barwick expressed his disappointment at the annual meeting of the IFAB in Gleneagles, Scotland: \"We were in favour of goal-line technology but there will be no more experiments and it will not be back on the agenda next year, or in the foreseeable future.\" \nFIFA President Blatter denied ulterior motives for the decision: \"There has been no change of heart. Referees make decisions, not machines... I have defended goal-line technology but it has become clear that such systems are too complicated and very costly. Nor would they necessarily add anything positive to the game and could harm the authority of the referee.\"\nFixed size for football pitch.\nAnother decision at Gleneagles was to fix the size of a soccer field for men's international matches at 105 x 68 metres. Until now, football's law number 1 stated that the field could be between 100 and 110 metres long and 64 to 75 metres wide. The Welsh Football Association proposed the change, arguing that size variation was an advantage for home teams, who could alter the size of the field against what the visiting team was used to.\nThe IFAB also agreed to simplify the text of the soccer rules at several points. The last major revision of the text was 11 years ago. The IFAB also condemned violent tackles, warning that \"players committing such acts should be banned.\"\nThe International Board, established in 1886, is currently made up of eight members, four representing the FIFA and four others from the English, Welsh, Scottish and Northern Irish Football association. Six members need to agree to confirm an IFAB ruling. Next year's meeting will be held in Northern Ireland."}

The People's Party is projected to win at least 154 seats.\n\"I have called the candidate of the Socialist Party and I have wished him luck for the good of Spain,\" Rajoy said in his concession speech.\n\"Thanks to all the citizens who have participated,\" Zapatero said after his challenger conceded. \"And thanks from my heart to the citizens who have, with their votes, given a clear victory to the Socialist Party.\"\n\"We have worked hard, and it's been worth the trouble,\" he added. \"I will govern by improving the things we did well and correcting our mistakes,\" he added.\nThe economy was a large focus of the election, with the unemployment rate rising and inflation at a 12 year high. To ease concerns about the economy, Zapatero said action would be taken to help construction workers that had been laid off, and he promised a 400 euro ($615) tax cut for all workers. \"I will govern for all, but thinking above all of those who don't have it all,\" Zapatero said.\nOn March 7, one day prior to the end of the official campaigning period, former Socialist politician was shot to death in Spain's region.

The turnout was estimated to be around 75 percent, close to the record 75.66 percent in the 2004 elections. The newspaper commented, \"Some are already beginning to put out the idea that a bigger Socialist win than predicted by the opinion polls will be due to the killing of Isaias Carrasco.\"\nThe killing drew comparisons to the , which killed 191 people three days before the general election in which Zapatero came to power.

One of Zapatero's first acts as Prime Minister was withdrawing troops from Iraq.\nDuring the campaign, Rajoy often criticized his Socialist rival for not doing enough to prevent terrorism and negotiate with the ETA. Zapatero's failed peace talks with the ETA, which ended with the separatists setting off a car bomb at a Madrid airport, became a highly debated issue in the election.\nIn his 4 years as president, Zapatero's government has enacted social reforms that include legalizing gay marriage, allowing for quicker divorces, and promoting gender equality. These policies conflicted with the views of the Roman Catholic Church, and in December, Catholics staged a mass protest against the government in Madrid."}

A law enforcement official who spoke to Associated Press on condition of anonymity stated that a federal wiretap related to a recent investigation revealed that Spitzer paid for prostitutes from an online service under investigation.\nABC News reported that, according to federal officials, the federal investigation into the prostitution ring was initially motivated by money transfers which led agents to believe Governor Spitzer was hiding bribes. Sources familiar with the case spoke to \"The Washington Post\" and CNN, and said that Spitzer is identified as \"Client 9\" in court documents and on a federal wiretap. \nIn a brief press conference held Monday afternoon, Spitzer apologized to his family and to the public, but did not directly admit or deny involvement in the prostitution ring. \"I apologize first and most importantly to my family. I apologize to the public, to whom I promised better. I must now dedicate some time to rededicate my trust to my family,\" he said, adding that he \"acted in a way that violates his obligation to his family.\"\nSpitzer did not answer questions from reporters, indicating he would have more to say \"in short order.\" He did not admit or deny any allegations.\n\"The Times\"' report alleges that Gov. Spitzer was a client of the Emperors Club VIP, a high-priced international prostitution ring. Last week, federal investigators arrested four people involved with the operation in and around New York. The investigation utilized undercover work and wiretap recordings at various club locations, including New York and Washington, with the latter allegedly containing Spitzer's voice. \nReports indicate the governor learned on Friday, March 7, of federal investigators' discovery of his alleged involvement in the prostitution ring. He informed his top aides on Sunday night before meeting with the rest of his staff Monday, according to \"The Times\". Sources for the Fox News Channel and WCBS-TV in New York report Spitzer could resign and be indicted, in which case the Lieutenant Governor of New York, David Paterson, would become governor.\nJames Tedisco, the New York State Assembly Republican Minority Leader, says Spitzer should resign and state Republican leadership will initiate impeachment proceedings if the governor fails to step down. \"Today's news that Eliot Spitzer was likely involved with a prostitution ring and his refusal to deny it leads to one inescapable conclusion: he has disgraced his office and the entire state of New York. He should resign his office immediately,\" stated Tedisco."}

Lift-off occurred at 06:28:14 UTC (02:28 local time). On board was a crew of seven astronauts; Mission Commander Dominic Gorie, Pilot Gregory Johnson, Robert Behnken, Michael Foreman, Richard Linnehan, Takao Doi and Garrett Reisman. \nAll except Reisman will return to Earth aboard \"Endeavour\" in two week's time. Reisman, a member of the ISS Expedition 16 and 17 crews, will remain aboard the Space Station, replacing L\u00e9opold Eyharts who launched aboard STS-122 last month.\nDuring the 16-day mission - the longest Shuttle flight in support of the ISS - the crew will install two major ISS components. the \"Kib\u014d\" Pressurised Logistics Module and the Canadian Special Purpose Dexterous Manipulator (SPDM). The \"Kib\u014d\" Pressurised Logistics Module is the first of three components which will form the Japanese Experiment Module (JEM). It will be temporarily installed on a spare docking port of the Harmony module of the Station, and will later be fitted to the main pressurised experiment module, which is slated for launch aboard STS-124, to be flown by \"Discovery\" in late May. \nSPDM, also known as Dextre, is a twin robotic arm system, or Remote Manipulator System (RMS), which will be installed on the end of the Space Station's Canadarm2 robotic arm. It will allow complex tasks to be completed without the need for a spacewalk.\nFive extra-vehicular activities are planned for the mission. The first three of these will be to assemble, install and test the Dextre SPDM. This will be followed by an EVA to test new tile repair techniques in the event of a Shuttle becoming damaged on a later mission. This test comes ahead of the planned STS-125 mission to service the Hubble Space Telescope in August. The final EVA will be to stow the Orbiter Boom Sensor System (OBSS) on the Space Station. \nThis usually remains on the Shuttle for launch and landing, however as the next mission, STS-124, is carrying a very large payload - the JEM pressurised experiment module - the OBSS cannot be accommodated in its payload bay for launch. Because it will be needed once the Shuttle reaches orbit, \"Discovery\" will collect the OBSS from the ISS, and return it to Earth at the end of its mission. The OBSS is used to conduct photography of the orbiter's heat shield, in order to check for damage, similar to that which caused the \"Columbia\" accident.\nTwo minor problems occurred during the launch. Firstly, the primary Flash Evaporator System failed, resulting in a switch to the backup system, which performed normally. The Flash Evaporator System is used to cool the Shuttle prior to the deployment of its radiators. The radiators were deployed normally following payload bay door opening, once the Shuttle was in orbit. The other issue was that instrumentation failed for a small number of Reaction Control System (RCS) thrusters, which are used to control the Shuttles attitude. \nNeither problem is expected to affect the mission. The ascent to orbit has been initially assessed as \"clean\" in terms of debris impacts, the only concern is a suspected birdstrike ten seconds after launch, however it is believed that \"Endeavour\" was not travelling fast enough to sustain damage.\nThis is the 122nd launch of the Space Shuttle, the 21st of \"Endeavour\", and the 25th Shuttle mission to the ISS. It also marks the ninth, and second manned, orbital launch of 2008. Launch occurred at night, making this the Shuttle's 30th night launch. This flight was originally scheduled to launch on February 14th, but after the previous mission, STS-122, was delayed due to bad sensors inside the external fuel tank, STS-123 was pushed back to no earlier than March 11."}

The following month Flight 172 cracked in half after a hard landing but held together, preventing fatalities. Both aircraft were Boeing 737s.\nDanke Drajat, spokesman for Adam Air, said that the airline was making efforts to comply with the demand. \"We are completing all manuals and revamping the standard operating procedure,\" he said.\nThe Adam Air accidents accounted for two of the three main accidents that caused the to ban Indonesian airlines from EU airspace last year over safety standards. The other, Garuda Indonesia Flight 200, involved a 737 belonging to the state owned flag carrier speeding off a runway at Yogyakarta during an attempted landing; 21 people were killed."}

The fate of the $3.5 billion mission was in the balance as the bus-sized spacecraft swooped to just 50 km (30 mi) above the surface of Enceladus to sample the frozen spray issuing from geysers on the moon's surface. The \"water\" spraying from these geysers is in the form of dust-sized, frozen water particles, which are ejected into space by gaseous water vapors that build up pressure deep within icy fissures on Enceladus. \nCassini's cosmic dust analyzer was unavailable due to a glitch in the updated software that was supposed to provide an increased hit count of the geyser dust particles. However, dust samples were collected before and after the closest approach and the mass spectrometer functioned throughout the flyby, providing useful data which is now being analyzed. \nMission controllers will have a chance to capture more geyser dust on October 9, 2008 when they may choose to steer Cassini even closer to the surface of Enceladus. \nTidal flexing of this moon due to the gravitational proximity of its host planet, Saturn, continually heaves and cracks the icy surface. This suggests that Enceladus may have a squishy, liquid-water ocean beneath an icy crust. Deep, parallel fissures in the ice crust, dubbed the \"Tiger Stripes\", measure warmer than uncracked, stationary surfaces nearby. Friction of these massive, moving plates of ice is thought to provide the heat responsible for the pressurized geysers of sublimated water and ice dust. The presence of these geysers amounts to more empirical evidence of a large, liquid water ocean below the surface of Enceladus.\nThe Cassini-Huygens space probe is an international mission involving the cooperative efforts of NASA, the European Space Agency, and the Italian Space Agency. Launched in 1997, Cassini has orbited Saturn since 2004 but has never before flown so close to a moon. On 14 January 2005, the Huygens lander successfully explored the atmosphere and surface conditions of Saturn's biggest moon, Titan. "}

Questions by the opposition during question time were dominated by the cash bonuses, with leader of the opposition, Brendan Nelson moving to censure the Prime Minister.\nIt was the first censure motion moved against the Prime Minister since his election last year.\nFor the past four years, the previous Howard government had made one-off payments to seniors of up to $500 and $1,600 to carers.\nFacing repeated questions, the Prime Minister said \"I guarantee that carers will not be one\ndollar worse off as a consequence of the budget\".\nMr Rudd said that the government was also looking at \"the challenges of carers and pensioners in the long term\" instead of through one-time bonus payments as the previous government had. Mr Rudd then called the opposition the \"new party of compassion\" and told the house that the Howard government had never committed to the payments in the long term, as they were not in forward budget estimates.\nBrendan Nelson then moved a motion to censure the Prime Minister over his plans. During his motion, Dr Nelson called upon the Prime Minister to \"get up, for God\u2019s sake, get up, stand in front of that microphone and say to the carers of this country, \u2018I, the Prime Minister of Australia, believe in you and will deliver you a lump sum payment in the budget.\"\nDr Nelson also accused the Prime Minister of not seeing the significance of the bonus payments for those who receive them. \"For someone earning $250,000 a year, a lump sum payment of $1,600 would probably\nmake them think: \u2018What\u2019s that? It\u2019s my credit card payment or whatever.\u2019\" said Dr Nelson.\nThe opposition leader told the House of Representatives that many people had been budgeting for the bonus payment and it was unfair for it to be taken from them. \"If you are hanging out for that lump sum payment, it is absolutely essential for your budgeting,\" said Dr Nelson.\nWhen the Prime Minister spoke against the motion, he reminded the opposition that a Liberal party document said \"A re-elected Coalition Government will consider continuing\nto pay these bonuses, depending on the economic circumstances at the time.\"\nMr Rudd then drew attention to his $500 utilities allowance, which will be paid to aged and disability pensioners as well as carers to counter the rise in the cost of living.\nSpeaking for the motion, opposition community services spokesman Tony Abbott accused the Rudd government of \"compassion fatigue\" and said that the cardboard cutout of the Prime Minister which appeared in parliament on the previous sitting day had \"more heart than this Prime Minister\".\nThe censure motion was defeated along party lines."}

The apology was unanimously supported by the House of Representatives.\nWhile speaking to students at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard, the former Prime Minister defended his decision not to apologise to indigenous Australians during his 11 years in office.\n\"I do not believe, as a matter of principle, that one generation can accept responsibility for the acts of an earlier generation. I don't accept that as a matter of principle,\" Mr Howard said.\n\"In some cases, children were wrongly removed; in other cases, they were removed for good reason; in other cases, they were given up; and in other cases, the judgment on the removal is obscure or difficult to make.\"\nMr Howard said the apology was dangerous as it led many to believe that the government had \"ticked the box\" on indigenous issues in Australia. \"The third reason I wasn't in favour of it was that it seems to me that there is a real danger that when we do something like that, there's a psychological reaction of the indigenous box has been ticked, and we've solved the problem,\"\n\"The commitment to do practical things such as reducing the gap between the life expectancy of indigenous Australians and other Australians, which is unacceptably high, is pushed into the background,\" the former PM told listeners.\nMr Howard said there had been a failure over the past few decades to address indigenous affairs. \"I think we persevered for too long with the notion of separate development. I think the only way the indigenous people of Australia can get what we call a fair go is for them to become part of the mainstream of the community and get the benefits and opportunities available from mainstream Australian society, whilst recognising \u2026 the particular and special place of the indigenous culture in the life of the country,\" said Mr Howard.\nMr Howard rejected suggestions from a member of the audience that his refusal to apologise to indigenous Australians and refusing to sign the Kyoto Protocol lost his government the election. \"The first lesson I learned is you win some, you lose some,\"\n\"I did have the opportunity of winning four elections,\" said Mr Howard."}

A fifteen-year-old youth, who was one of a gang of five, is charged with having kicked and stamped the 20-year-old woman to death in Stubby Lee Park, Bacup, Rossendale in Lancashire on the 11 August 2007. \nThe couple; Robert Maltby, an art student, 21 and Sophie Lancaster, 20; became engaged in an initially civil conversation with the drunken gang while walking in the park. \nThe attack began with a kick to the head of the male victim by the accused 15-year-old. the gang then continued to kick and stamp on Robert Maltby while laughing and encouraging each other. As Miss Lancaster begged the gang to stop beating her boyfriend they turned on her. \nThe jury were played a recording of a 999 call made shortly after the attack by an eye witness. In the recording, a girl is heard sobbing and crying who details the attack and pleads: \"We need, we need an ambulance at Bacup Park, this just been banged because he's a mosher.\" referring to the attack on Robert Maltby.\nThis motive was referred to by Michael Shorrock QC during the prosecution: \"It would appear that [they] were singled out, not for anything they had said or done, but because they dressed differently to the defendant and his friend\".\nMiss Lancaster sustained such extensive injuries that on the arrival of the paramedics they were unable to determine her gender. The couple were taken to hospital where both victims fell in to comas. Robert Maltby regained consciousness and survived his injuries but Sophie Lancaster died two weeks later.\nThe youth denies the charge but admits to causing grievous bodily harm with intent. Three other youths, two aged seventeen and one sixteen have been remanded in custody by Judge Anthony Russell QC after admitting to playing a part in the attack. They will face sentencing after the trial of the fifteen-year-old."}

The Atlas V carrier rocket flew in the 411 configutation, with a 4 metre diameter fairing, one solid rocket motor, and a single-engine \"Centaur\" upper stage.\nThe rocket lifted off from Vandenberg Air Force Base, Space Launch Complex 3 East (SLC-3E), at 10:02 GMT (03:02 local time) this morning. Today's flight marks the thirteenth launch of the Atlas V, and the first Atlas V launch from Vandenberg. It is also the tenth orbital launch of 2008. The satellite entered a Molniya orbit, usually used by the NRO for SIGINT and communications satellites.\nThe launch was conducted by United Launch Alliance, a joint venture between Lockheed Martin, who designed and built the Atlas V, and Boeing, to provide EELV launches for the US Government. ULA president Michael Gass described the launch as \"a proud moment in our company's history\". The launch had been delayed by two years, from early 2006, due to a number of factors.\nIn addition to its reconnaissance payload, the satellite is carrying two small experiments. SBIRS-HEO 2 and TWINS-B. SBIRS is a test article for a missile detection system, slated to launch late this year or early next, and TWINS is a NASA infrared astronomy experiment. They will remain attached to the satellite for the duration of its mission.\nFollowing the separation of the payload fairing, around five minutes after launch, all information on the launch was withheld, however about an hour into the flight, the launch was confirmed to have been successful. ULA will conduct its next launch on Saturday, when a Delta II will orbit a GPS satellite. The next Atlas launch is scheduled for mid-April, with the ICO G1 communication satellite."}

A human's normal body temperature is 98.6\u00b0F (37\u00b0C).

Current averages are compared to the average SWE for 1971-2000. In recent years, snow pack in this region has been anything but normal.\nThe Outlook Reports are issued January to June. Since March 2000, only five of 46 months have been above normal. While many of the winter months have been near normal, June's snow pack is far below average. Even in 2006, the wettest year of the last eight years, June snow pack was only 37% of the average. \nIn an e-mail interview with \"Wikinews\", Lee Hackleman, Water Supply Specialist, said \nIn a phone interview with \"Wikinews\", Myra Wilensky of the National Wildlife Federation in nearby Colorado, also commented on changing snow patterns.\nThis is part of a general increase in temperature in the region.

Warmer winters have led to mass infestations in Western lodge pole pine forests and \"The New York Times\" reports that they are now moving on to white bark pines in Yellowstone particularly impacting grizzly bears there. In turn, the grizzlies are shifting to feeding on Canadian thistle, an invasive species that might be choking out native plants.\nChanging weather patterns have also affected large migratory animals.\nWater for people has also become a major issue in the region. \nKansas has long fought Wyoming over water rights issues.

The announcement Friday by the British government came after the European Parliament urged a resolution to the case and said that Iran has a history of torturing and executing homosexuals.\nBritain had initially rejected an asylum request by 19-year-old Mehdi Kazemi, and Kazemi fled to the Netherlands, where his case was turned down and he returned to Britain. British Home Secretary Jacqui Smith released a statement on the case: \"Following representations made on behalf of Mehdi Kazemi, and in the light of new circumstances since the original decision was made, I have decided that Mr. Kazemi's case should be reconsidered on his return to the UK from the Netherlands.\" \nEighty members of Britain's upper house of Parliament sent a letter to Jacqui Smith, appealing to the government to \"show compassion and allow Mr. Kazemi to have a safe haven in the United Kingdom.\" Roger Roberts of the House of Lords initiated the petition, and stated: \"There is no doubt that he will be persecuted and possibly face state-sanctioned murder if he is forced to return.\" Simon Hughes, Member of Parliament for North Southwark and Bermondsey, said he would support Kazemi if he returns to the United Kingdom: \"I hope Mr Kazemi will now come back to Britain where arrangements are already in place for an urgent meeting with him, his family, specialist lawyers and myself to prepare a new application to the Home Office.\"\nGay rights advocate and spokesman for the British gay rights group OutRage!, David Allison commented \"It's cruel to even suggest sending him back ... The history of gays in Iran has been horrific.\" Ben Summerskill of the British gay rights organization, Stonewall, said: \"We are obviously delighted that the home secretary has listened to the representations that were made in this case ... There are overwhelming reasons why people should not be deported to Iran in the current circumstances, and it is important that Britain is seen as a safe haven.\"\nBorg Palm, Kazemi's solicitor, stated Kazemi was pleased with the news but would have an unstable future in Britain without asylum: \"He is very much afraid of being allowed to stay in Britain but without being granted official permission. That would then put him in a no man\u2019s land. He would be very unhappy in the long term.\"\nKazemi came to Britain in 2005 to study English. His uncle spoke with \"CNN\" on condition of anonymity, and said that his nephew was studying in Britain in 2006 when his partner in Iran was arrested and hanged after being charged with sodomy. Kazemi's uncle told \"CNN\": \"Under torture and pressure, (the partner) revealed Mehdi's name as his boyfriend.\" Gay sex is considered a crime in Iran, and is punishable by death. Kazemi told British authorities in his asylum application that Iranian police were after him, and that he could face execution if he returned to Iran. Kazemi stated in his asylum request: \"I cannot stop my attraction to men ... If I return to Iran I will be arrested and executed like [my boyfriend]. Since this incident ... I have been so scared.\"\nAfter Britain's Home Office initially denied Kazemi's asylum application, he fled to Canada and then the Netherlands, where he was detained. Kazemi faces deportation from the Netherlands to Britain, after their highest court rejected his plea on Tuesday. The Netherlands' highest court rejected the case, citing EU law that Kazemi's case was the responsibility of the country where he first requested asylum.\nA resolution passed by the European Parliament Thursday asked EU states \"to find a common solution to ensure that Mehdi Kazemi is granted asylum or protection on EU soil and not sent back to Iran.\" The resolution also stated that Iranian authorities \"routinely detain, torture and execute persons, notably homosexuals\" and that \"Mehdi's partner has already been executed, while his father has threatened him with death.\" \nIn a September 2007 speech at Columbia University, Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was challenged by University president Lee Bollinger for Iran's treatment of gays. Ahmadinejad stated that \"In Iran we don't have homosexuals like in your country,\" drawing laughter from the audience. \"In Iran we do not have this phenomenon, I don't know who has told you that we have it.\" According to Iranian human rights activists, over 4,000 gay men and lesbians have been executed since the Iranian Revolution of 1979."}

At least two protesters are reported to have been shot dead by riot police. \nThe Chinese government reacted quickly to the protests. An eyewitness report describes hundreds of police forces barricading the city's main square, some opening fire on protesters. Other reports suggest the city is under a sort of lockdown. \"The Sera monastery is surrounded by Chinese soldiers or police,\" an eyewitness told ABC News. \"I went yesterday to an area nearby to meet a Tibetan friend, and I saw the monastery surrounded by them.\"\nThe protests began rather peacefully on Monday, when a group of monks marched in Lhasa to advocate religious freedom. The march came on the 49th anniversary of Tibet's 1959 rebellion against China. When 50 or 60 of the monks were arrested, hundreds of other monks took to the streets to demand their release. Soon, ordinary Tibetans became involved as well, and the protests grew more violent.\nAround 400 protesters gathered at a market near the Jokhang temple, where they were confronted by 1,000 police, according to a witness cited by the Free Tibet Campaign. Cars, buses, and military vehicles were burned as plumes of smoke rose above the city. Protesters also set fire to shops, most of which were owned by ethnic Chinese. \"Some of them are looting those shops, taking out the contents and throwing them on huge fires which they've lit in the street,\" said James Miles, a British journalist. \nNear Barkhor, one man said that two soldiers have been killed, and that Tibetans were beating Chinese residents with iron rods. Another eyewitness in Lhasa said that people were being carried away on stretchers. \"People have been burning cars and motorbikes and buses,\" one resident said. \"There is smoke everywhere and they have been throwing rocks and breaking windows. We're scared.\"\nPsurbu Tsering of the \"Tibetan Association of New York and New Jersey\" said his members had received phone calls from Tibet, claiming 70 people had been killed and 1,000 arrested in Tibet. These reports could not be verified.\nThe unrest has reportedly spread to other provinces, and even other countries. Similar protests were seen in Nepal's capital of Kathmandu, where 1,000 protesters, including monks, gathered at a rally in support of the Tibet demonstrations. Around 12 monks were injured. In the United States, six Tibetans were arrested after holding protests outside the United Nations building in New York City. \nAn official from the Tibet Autonomous Region accused the Dalai Lama, Tenzin Gyatso, of orchestrating the protests, saying there was enough evidence to prove they were \"organized, premeditated and masterminded\" by Gyatso and his close supporters. A spokesperson for the Dalai Lama denied these allegations, saying the protests were \"completely spontaneous\".\nIn a statement, the Dalai Lama called the protests a \"manifestation of the deep-rooted resentment of the Tibetan people\". He insisted that both sides end the violence, telling the Chinese government to \"stop using force and address the long-simmering resentment of the Tibetan people through dialogue,\" and he urged his \"fellow Tibetans not to resort to violence.\"\nXinhua, the Chinese state-run news agency, reported in the early hours of Saturday that the situation had \"basically returned to normal\", although some people had been injured and were taken to the hospital. A Chinese official said the government is \"fully capable of maintaining social stability\" in Tibet.\nThe events prompted responses from European leaders, including Dimitrij Rupel, foreign minister of Slovenia and current President of the European Council. \"We would like to see some kind of reconciliation between the Chinese authorities and the Tibetan representatives,\" he said. \nFrench foreign minister Bernard Kouchner alluded to a connection between the protests and the 2008 Summer Olympics, which are set to occur in Beijing this August. \"France can draw attention to the link between the Olympic Games and this Tibetan aspiration, which China has to take into account.\" However, he will not be supporting a boycott of the games. Neither will European Union foreign policy chief Javier Solana, who said, \"As far as the Olympic Games are concerned I intend to be there.\""}

Around forty minutes after lift-off, ILS reported that an anomaly had occurred during the second burn of the upper stage. AMC-14, which would have been operated in conjunction with Echostar was to provide direct-to-home satellite television services. It was based on the Lockheed Martin A2100 satellite bus.\nThis is the 11th orbital launch of 2008, and the first to fail. It is also the 334th launch of the Proton rocket, the 41st Proton launch failure, the 2,800th Russian orbital launch, and the 45th Proton launch to be conducted by ILS. It is also the third failure of a Proton during an ILS launch in as many years, following a malfunction during a launch last September, and another in February 2006.\nThe Proton itself performed nominally, and the Briz-M upper stage successfully completed the first of three burns. During the second burn, however, an undisclosed malfunction occurred, leaving the satellite stranded in a much lower orbit than planned. It is unclear whether the satllite is recoverable. There are currently three options, which are to declare the satellite a write-off and de-orbit it, attempt to raise it to geosynchronous orbit under its own power, or propel it towards the Moon, using lunar gravity to slingshot it back into the correct orbit. If either of the latter options are chosen, it will be at great cost to the satellite's on-orbit life expectancy."}

Sarah Gavin spoke via email to \"Wikinews\"' Gabriel Pollard exclusively.\nBebo - its full name being Blog Early Blog Often - started off life with its name being adopted from a suggestion a journalist made, as well as the memorable nature of the name. Ms Gavin said, \"The reality is that the name was chosen for more practical reasons\u2026 it was memorable, translated well and most importantly it was available.\"\nFounded in 2005 by husband and wife team, Michael Birch and Xochi Birch, Bebo was an online community for Internet users to talk to one another online, write blog posts and generally post pictures. Now in 2008, \"Bebo allows users to find and communicate with friends as well as discovering, experiencing and sharing professional and user-generated content including video, music, books and other forms of entertainment,\" Ms Gavin said. 2005 was the year when at least another two social networking sites entered the market with Friendster and Ringo.com, which was set up by the same people who created Bebo. Ringo was later sold on to Monster.com.\nNot only does Bebo facilitate the aforementioned activities on it's site, but also has access to professional content produced by broadcasters, such as TVNZ in New Zealand, and producers. This is done through its Open Media platform which claims to have over 400 media partners signed up.\nMs Gavin said, \"Bebo offers many of the same features found on other sites, but unlike most social networks that limit their scope to communications and utility platforms, Bebo has opened its doors to all media companies, bringing the richness of the media world to its fast-growing community of users.\"\nBebo even has its own television series it hosts on its website. \"KateModern\", produced by those who made the popular \"Lonelygirl15\" web-series, is a series exclusive to the Internet and was commissioned by Bebo in April, 2007. Bebo boasts that KateModern is the most popular television show on the Internet and saw it attain over 35 million views in the first season alone.\nIn early December 2007, Bebo announced its Open Application Platform, compatible with Facebook's F8 and Google's OpenSocial platforms. This new platform opens up its API so developers such as NBC Universal and Last.fm can build applications for use on Bebo. 1,300 applications have already been made for Bebo.\nWith over 40 million members internationally, Bebo has become the only \"global Social Media Network\" in existence today. Each month its demographic users aged between 16 and 24-years of age inclusive spend a combined total of 2.14 billion minutes a month surfing the highly popular site; or 40 minutes a day per user. The majority of its membership are from English-speaking nations such as United States, Australia and New Zealand where it experiences high popularity.\nIn the United Kingdom alone, Bebo has more than 11.4 million users, with 1.3 million located just in Ireland; 80% of Irish members are over 18-years-old. Ms Gavin spoke further on the popularity experienced in the world, \"It is the number one social networking site in New Zealand, the number two site in Australia, and the number three site in the US and Canada.\"\nBebo experiences a gender balance with a virtual \"50:50\" split between female and male users \"in each territory\".\nThere is also a local version catered for the Polish community as well as there being plans to migrate into a local French and Spanish site.\nBebo also experiences higher usage than rival social networking site, MySpace, and video sharing website, YouTube, combined. \"Bebo users are the most engaged and view an average of 92 pages per usage day,\" Ms Gavin said.\nMs Gavin said, \"Only 10 months after its inception, Bebo was voted Best Social Networking Web Site by more than 300,000 voters in the annual People's Voice awards, in May 2006. Bebo won the People's Choice award in the Social Networking category at the 2006 Webby awards and was named as the number one search term in the Year-End Google Zeitgeist 2006.\"\nRecently it has emerged that youth in Wales have been committing suicide to gain attention, such as having a memorial page on the networking site. In response Bebo have set up their own service called \"Be Well\" to help make Bebo a \"safe and secure environment.\" Ms Gavin said, \"We are actively working with mental health and social care organisations \u2013 including Samaritans \u2013 to provide support and advice for our members.\n\"Bebo recognizes the potential dangers of online and takes proactive measures to promote safe use of its network. Bebo works in collaboration with law enforcement agencies from across the globe... [and] features a 'report abuse' button on every page.\"\nThe \"Be Well\" service has recently expanded its offerings to the Australian and New Zealand markets too.\nWhen asked to comment on any possible offers to buy Bebo by such companies as Google, Ms Gavin said that it was against policy to comment on \"rumour and speculation\". However, after the interview, it was revealed that Time Warner's AOL Internet division is set to buy up Bebo for US$850 million."}

The Fulton Cotton Mill Lofts are located in the historic Cabbagetown neighborhood, where at least 20 homes were destroyed. \"It looks like a bomb went off, it looks like World War III,\" said Mahsud Olufani, who has an art studio in the neighbourhood. \"It's a disaster area.\"\nAt least 27 people suffered injuries, mostly cuts and bruises. One person is reported to be in critical condition. Grady Memorial Hospital, where many of the injured were taken, had suffered some window damage but was still operating. Around 50 people have been taken to a local Red Cross shelter for displaced residents.\nThe tornado struck during the semifinal game of the SEC Basktetball Tournament between Mississippi State and Alabama. Play was stopped with around 2 minutes to go in overtime when heavy wind could be heard outside with rippling of the roof. Damage was done to the roof as debris fell to the floor. No injuries were reported in the Dome. \"I thought it was a tornado or a terrorist attack,\" said Mississippi State guard Ben Hansbrough.\nThe storm arrived with little forewarning. A tornado warning was issued for the downtown area a few minutes before the storm hit. \"Ironically, the guy behind me got a phone call saying there was a tornado warning,\" said Lisa Lynn, who was attending the game at the Georgia Dome. \"And in two seconds, we heard the noise and things started to shake. It was creepy.\"\nThe CNN Center in downtown Atlanta was severely damaged, especially in the atrium, where the ravaged ceiling allowed water to pour in. Police closed several streets near the CNN Center because of the debris, which included power lines, billboards, and even office chairs. \nThe Omni Hotel, which is attached to the CNN Center, also sustained damage, with many of its windows shattered. Visitors at the hotel were evacuated to the exhibition hall at street level. \"It was crazy. There was a lot of windows breaking and stuff falling,\" said Terrence Evans, a valet at the hotel.\nAt Centennial Olympic Park, located near CNN and the Omni Hotel, two Olympic torch sculptures had fallen over, and a performance pavilion was destroyed. A high-rise dorm at Georgia State University was damaged by the tornado, as evidenced by a large hole in the building's 14th floor. University students were evacuated on buses.\nAccording to Georgia Power, more than 13,000 of their customers are currently without electricity. Crews are working to fix downed power lines, but they said it would be difficult with all the debris.\nAnother large storm, currently in Mississippi, is heading towards Atlanta, and is forecast to arrive around 3 p.m. National Weather Service meteorologist Mike Leary said Friday's storm could be \"nothing to compare with what's coming in tomorrow\".\nAll downtown events scheduled to occur Saturday have been cancelled. This includes the city's Saint Patrick's Day parade. The remaining SEC tournament games are to be played at Georgia Tech's Alexander Memorial Coliseum, located in the undamaged midtown."}

Several were U.S. citizens.\" The three teams referred to were dismantling obsolete munitions stored there, as part of a programme to remove Stalinist era arms and modernize the military in order to qualify for an invitation to join NATO next month.\nInjured people have been rushed to hospitals amid ongoing explosions, which Interior Ministry spokesman Avni Neza says have prevented helicopters landing in the area. The wounded are suffering from burns, concussion, broken limbs and shrapnel injuries. Meanwhile, Neza says police and army units are attempting to reach the area in armored cars.

Explosions have been ongoing at least two hours.\nTirana Airport spokesman Arlinda Causholli said glass windows and doors at the airport, a few kilometers from the site, were shattered by the initial series of explosions. \"We evacuated passengers from the affected area and suspended flights for around 30 minutes,\" he said. \nA \"Reuters\" cameraman in the area described the scene. \"Terrified people are leaving the area on foot along the highway, women and children...

I hope we will not find other victims.\" He added that authorities are investigating the cause of the accident.\nThe crane broke into pieces as it fell from a height of 15 or 20 stories, according to witnesses. It hit three residential buildings in the course of the fall and completely crushed the aforementioned townhouse, which housed a bar on the first floor. \"The top of the crane went right through the building, and it sliced it in half,\" said Maryann Krajacic, who lives next to the townhouse.\nThe bar was closed when the crane fell, but John LaGreco, who owns the bar, fears one of his employees may be dead within the rubble. \"Our bar is done,\" he said. \"If I wasn't watching a Yankees game, I would've come to work early and gotten killed.\"\nCars were overturned and buried in rubble, and the air was filled with clouds of smoke and dust. Around 150 police officers blocked off the area, and 300 firefighters frantically searched for any additional victims. The search could continue all night, said Fire Commissioner Nicholas Scoppetta, and would include search dogs and thermal-imaging, and listening devices.\nMore than half a dozen buildings in the vicinity were evacuated, and a Red Cross shelter was set up nearby.\nStephen Kaplan, an owner of the Reliance Construction Group, says the accident resulted from a falling piece of steel, which severed one of the ties holding the crane to the building. \"All the piece of steel had to do was fall slightly left or right, and nothing would have happened,\" Kaplan said.\nManhattan Borough president Scott Stringer said local residents had often complained about security violations in the building's construction; they asserted that crews worked illegal hours and that the building was going up too quickly. \"Over the last year, this is becoming standard in my borough,\" Stringer said. \"I think we have a real issue here.\"\nOn March 4, a caller told officials that the crane lacked a sufficient number of safety ties. It was inspected March 6, and no violation was issued. The crane was also inspected Friday, the day before the accident."}

However, other members of Anonymous who took leading roles in arranging the protest are adamant that the Dekalb police had previously told them they did not need a permit to protest.\nThe arrests were filmed by other members of Anonymous who subsequently posted the videos onto popular video-sharing website YouTube. The videos show a very quick arrest in which the arresting officers did not read the of the protesters, which\u2014contrary to popular belief\u2014is only required to be read before a police officer interviews someone in custody. This was confirmed by other members of the group who say they didn't hear their rights being read before they were led away. \"They were grabbed and taken behind the complex in one swift strike. There was no Miranda rights read when they were initially grabbed\" said one member of Anonymous interviewed by Wikinews.\nIn other videos published on YouTube, the same members of Anonymous were shown thanking police for their work and offering them some of the cake members of Anonymous had brought to the protest, shortly before they were arrested.\nMembers of Anonymous have composed an open letter to Dekalb's Chief of Police, asking if such a show of police strength was really needed at a non-violent protest organised and attended mainly by college students and young Americans.\nDrivers showing their support for the protesters by honking their car horns while driving past were followed by police bikes waiting in the Scientology building's driveway and given tickets for violating noise ordinance laws. However, many members of Anonymous have voiced confusion over these tickets, as the honks of support were only 2-3 seconds in duration at most, and noise ordinance laws state a horn must be sounded for longer than 60 seconds to count as a violation of the law. When, after the arrests were made, the police started to adopt the policy of ticketing drivers who honked, members of Anonymous quickly raised \"Do not honk\" signs to drivers.\nBoth of the members of Anonymous have been released, one with a bail of $763.00. There are confirmed to be two charges standing against one. No information has been released from the police department at this point.\nInitial reaction from bloggers was generally critical of the arrests. Kalira of \"Doomfeller blog\" wrote: \"This is UNACCEPTABLE. They did no wrong, and that building they were led into was reportedly the Scientology Org building. If the police\u2014nay, the walking tanks, totally uncalled for with a peaceful protest\u2014had them unmask inside ... suffice it to say if they get harassed, there will be great big steaming piles of hell to pay.\"\nScientology critic Jeff Jacobsen, who was interviewed by \"Wikinews\" on February 19, wrote on his blog: \"But then I see that the Atlanta police arrested two Anons, and were even stopping cars that honked in approval of the protest! Is Atlanta not a part of the United States? I don't get it.\"\nInterview.\nThe videos and arrests have sparked outrage amongst members of the public and Anonymous, and \"Wikinews\" interviewed members of Anonymous who were at the Atlanta protest on Saturday: \nWhat was your initial reaction to the arrests at the protest?\nWhat has been your experience dealing with the Atlanta police?\nWas there any statement issued by police on what the two arrested individuals were arrested for?\nSources.\n__NOEDITSECTION__"}

This year, the U.S. government will only issue 33,000 visas for winter workers and 33,000 for summer workers. This comes as a stark comparison to 2007, when 120,000 foreign workers entered the U.S. with H-2B visas. \nCurrently, the reduction in visas is having profounds effects on both Mexico and U.S. \nIn Tlapacoyan, a Mexican town which in the last 30 years has exported a large seasonal workforce, using H-2B visas, to work in U.S. circuses and carnivals, the effects are already a stark reality. The local economy has been paralyzed, and unemployment has reached dramatic highs. The lack of money being pumped into the local economy has caused many businesses to close, and the construction of the town's new church has come to a screeching halt. Additionally, residents like Pablo Juarez Mendoza, who last year made $450 working in Texan livestock shows, are having difficulties finding local work. Those that do, are only making an average of $50 per week. \nU.S. businesses are getting ready to face their own set of economical obstacles caused by the lack of cheap labor. Many employers are finding creative ways to cut costs, including scaling back operations. In Cape Cod, for example, the local chamber of commerce reports that town employers will only receive 15 of the 5,000 visas requested. In response, local Cape Cod business owner, Williman Zammer, has called the situation \"a major crisis,\" and states that what the Hispanic Caucus is doing is \"ruthless.\" \nOpponents of the change state that recent legislation blocking is part of the Caucus' efforts to push for comprehensive immigration reform, not seen in the U.S. since the early 1980s. Hispanic Caucus Chairman, Rep. Joe Baca, D-California, hopes that policymakers will place attention not only on helping small businesses, but also on what to do with 12 million illegal immigrants currently residing in the U.S., and improving border security. \nThe issue of immigration has become a polarizing subject in the U.S., and one that has been an intrinsic part of the fabric that makes up the American society. Since 2006, the U.S. accepts more legal immigrants as permanent residents than any other country in the world. That same year, a NBC/Wall Street Journal poll revealed that the U.S. public was equally divided on the whether immigration helps or hurts the country. Forty-four percent said it helped, forty-five percent said it hurt. \nHowever, a recent Pew Research Center study suggests that the issue will remain at the forefront of the American political agenda for many years to come. \nThe study revealed that by 2050, one in five Americans will be foreign-born, and the overall U.S. population will double to 438 million. The U.S Latino population will account for 30% of the population, while Asians will account for 9%. Thus, what we see unfolding is a U.S. where minorities will become the majority, and drastic cultural and societal changes seem almost certain. \nThe study seems to also hint that this growth is in many ways connected to legislation passed by Congress in 1965, that abolished a quota system that had nearly ended immigration from non-European countries since the 1920s, and consequently caused an immigration surge.

This is because major financial difficulties have become apparent today, with two major shareholders pulling out of the company.\nPT Global Transport Service (GTS) and Bright Star Perkasa, who between them own a 50% stake in the company, have decided to sell back all their shares to their original owners, who control the other 50%. These are the family of founder Adam Suherman and Sandra Ang. \nThe companies invested in the airline last year, when the company was struggling after the New Year's Day disappearance of Adam Air Flight 574 with 102 on board. The Boeing 737 (B737) was ultimately determined to have crashed into the sea near Sulawesi, and all on board are presumed dead. Shortly afterwards, Adam Air Flight 172, another B737, snapped in half during a hard landing, but held together preventing fatalities. These were not the first serious accidents for the company, as in February 2006 Flight 782 became lost for several hours after navigation systems failed and the plane entered a radar blackspot, forcing a subsequent emergency landing many miles from the intended route. The given reasons for the withdrawal are a lack of improvement in safety and financial irregularities.\nThe company has now also defaulted on debt payments to aircraft lease firms, resulting in 12 of their 22 planes being seized, and has cut the number of routes served from 52 to 12. The remaining ten planes are also in default and at risk of seizure. Adam Air owes leasing companies US$14 million compared to free capital of $4.8 million of free capital. They have agreed to buy back shares gradually for $11 million (100 billion rupiah), $6 million less than the investment firms paid for them. The cost difference will be borne by Harry Tanoesoedibyo's family, the founder of PT Bhakti Investama, of which GTS is a wholly owned subsidiary. The companies have also lost 157 billion rupiah worth of investment in the company since the April 2007 deal. 9,325 Rupiah are currently worth US$1.\nGTS director Gustiono Kustianto said that \"Since we joined, our priority has been safety\" but that Adam Air's management had been unresponsive to pressure from the new investors to improve its poor record. Last weeek another company B737 shot off the runway during landing, damaging the plane and injuring five.\nLawyer Marx Andryan of Hotman Paris Hutapea, representing the investment firms, said they have documents proving the company has not adequatly seen to pilot recruitment, maintenance and insurance.\nSuherman said \"We have defaulted and the investors have done nothing about it. We'll continue to operate as long as we have planes,\" adding that there are no current plans to declare bankruptcy.\n\"Out of 22 planes, now we only have 10 because 12 of them have been declared in default. The other 10 have been declared in default as well, but I'm still trying to work out a way to restructure the payments,\" he told \"Reuters\". He went on to say that a cash injection is required, and that \"There is a possibility starting on March 21 Adam Air will temporarily cease operations until there is a decision from the shareholders regarding the insurance premium.\""}

Although official results won't be released until Wednesday, much of the country's media has already declared Encinas the winner. \nRoy Campos, president of Consulta Mitofsky, said that Encinas would remain in the lead after the rest of the votes were counted.\n\"The trend is very clear,\" Encinas said in a television interview.\nSunday's vote was split between those who strongly oppose Felipe Calder\u00f3n's presidency, like Encinas, and party moderates who favor negotiating with the government, like Ortega. The party has been this way ever since the 2006 presidential election, when Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador contested the results, believing he had defeated Calder\u00f3n, and declared himself the \"legitimate\" president. \nEncinas, who once served in Obrador's cabinet and doesn't recognize Calder\u00f3n as president, said the party needs \"a very important redesign\" to avoid these kinds of disputes. Both sides accused the other of voting irregularities in Sunday's election, including vote-buying, intimidation, and improper handling of ballots.\nNotimex, the government news agency, reported that a fight broke out at one polling place in Mexico City, and that several other stations had to be shut down."}

He will always be the Dalai Lama.\"\nThe Dalai Lama responded to accusations made by China's premier, Wen Jiabao, who said there was evidence proving that the riots were \"organised, premeditated, masterminded and incited by the Dalai clique\". The Dalai Lama asked Chinese officials to come to his headquarters in Dharamsala and investigate. \"Check our various offices,\" he said. \"They can examine my pulse, my urine, my stool, everything.\"\nHe also suggested that the Chinese themselves may have orchestrated the protests as a way to discredit him. \"It's possible some Chinese agents are involved there,\" the Dalai Lama said. \"Sometimes totalitarian regimes are very clever, so it is important to investigate.\"\nWen Jiabao's remarks came at an annual news conference at the end of China's national legislative session. He said the intent of the riots was to \"undermine the Beijing Olympic Games\" and \"serve their hidden agenda\". He added, \"This has all the more revealed that the consistent claims made by the Dalai clique that they pursue not independence but peaceful dialogue are nothing but lies.\"\nWen said China will be open to negotiation with the Dalai Lama if he recognizes Tibet and Taiwan as \"inalienable parts of the Chinese territory\". The Dalai Lama responded by inviting Wen to speak with him. \"If the Chinese side ... accepts the reality and addresses the Tibetan problem realistically, within a few hours we can solve this problem,\" he said.\nAlthough China suspects the Dalai Lama and his followers wish to break away from Chinese control, Tenzin Gyatso said that \"independence is out of the question\" and instead advocated greater autonomy within China. \"We should not develop anti-Chinese feelings,\" he said. \"We must live together side by side.\"\nHe said he plans to meet with Tibetan exiles who are currently marching from India to Lhasa, as he believes their ambitions to be futile. \"Will you get independence? What's the use?\" he asked, calling for them to stop at the border.\nMeanwhile, China continued with efforts to arrest those involved in the Lhasa demonstrations, after a midnight deadline for protesters to turn themselves in passed without any apparent surrenders. Witnesses reported 4 army trucks carrying off dozens of handcuffed prisoners. Urgen Tenzin, executive director of the Tibetan Center for Human Rights and Democracy, said about 600 Tibetans were arrested Monday.\nPolice were seen patrolling the streets of Lhasa, carrying batons or rifles and checking for identification papers. \"When the fighting began, you saw no Chinese,\" said John Kenwood, a Canadian tourist. \"Now you see no Tibetans on the streets. The young Tibetans are probably hiding.\"\nThe protests, which began in Lhasa, have since spread to neighboring provinces. In Aba, Sichuan, one witness reported 17 deaths. \"Earlier today, the whole town was teeming with police and soldiers,\" he said. \"All the shops have been closed. There are no arrests that I know of ... People are anticipating that something big is going to happen.\" Elsewhere in Sichuan, thousands of Tibetans turned out in the streets of Seda, according to the Tibetan Center for Human Rights and Democracy. \nThe international community has repeatedly urged China to use restraint in dealing with protesters, and to start talks with the Dalai Lama. United States Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said on Monday, \"We have really urged the Chinese over several years to find a way to talk with the Dalai Lama, who is a figure of authority, who is not a separatist, and to find a way to engage him and bring his moral weight to a more sustainable and better solution of the Tibet issue.\""}

The airline has recently suffered safety problems and financial difficulty.\nFormed in 2003, Adam Air hit financial crisis on Monday when two major shareholders, investment companies who control 50% of the airline, announced they were pulling out and selling all shares back to the original owners, who still control the other half. The reasons given were a lack of improvement in safety and alleged financial mismanagement.\nThe shares were bought after two major accidents hit the budget carrier last year. On New Year's day Adam Air Flight 574 disapeared and was found to have crashed into the ocean near Sulawesi, leaving 102 missing and presumed dead. Shortly afterwards, another company aircraft snapped in half during landing, but fatalities were prevented because the compromised airframe held together. Both were Boeing 737 (B737) aircraft. At the airline's height, it operated 22 of these, serving domestic routes across the Indonesian archipelago and daily international flights to Malaysia and Singapore.\nAdam Air also had a serious incident in early 2006, when all navigational systems on a B737 failed, causing the plane to inadvertently enter an accident blackspot. The aircraft was lost for several hours before performing an emergency landing hundreds of miles from its intended destination.\nOn March 10, another Adam Air B737 overshot the runway during landing at Batam island's airport. Since then, Adam Air has been issued two deadlines in rapid succession by the authorities - one to solve safety issues, and one to prove its financial viability. They have cut routes from 52 to 12, and defaulted on all payments on their aircraft to the leasing companies, who have seized back 12 of them.\nGustiono Kustianto, director of one of the two leasing companies, said the carrier's \"life expectancy is less than a month,\" and that it owes US$14 million to leasing companies compared to $4.8 million of free capital.\nAviation director general Budhi Mulyawan Suyitno said that Adam Air had been grounded due to inadequate Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul (MRO) standards and poor pilot training. He said that investigations into last week's crash, which injured five people and severely damaged the aircraft, had revealed \"the pilot had no idea what to do in an emergency situation.\" The airline will spend three months grounded, after which it will be shut down entirely if it does not show it has improved.\n\"The Transport Ministry has decided to revoke Adam Air's operational specification, effective 12am Wednesday (4am AEDT),\" said Suyitno. \"With this, Adam Air is banned from operating its aircraft. All of its planes must be automatically grounded.\" He commented that a quarterly evaluation had uncovered \"violations that could put passengers' safety at risk\".\nThe news coincides with a two-day ultimatum from Adam Air's insurance provider. Failure to pay the insurance premiums would also have resulted in grounding.\nFounder Adam Suherman - whose family owns half the airline alongside Sandra Ang - commented today that the situation with the shareholders had demoralised pilots. \"That in turn would affect their performance. It is very dangerous.\" He also said that he was not surprised Adam Air had been grounded. Yesterday, he said that there were no plans to file for bankruptcy.\nHis immediate reaction to the news from the insurance - which preceded the grounding by several hours - was that his airline likely could not insure the entire fleet, saying \"There have been warnings from the insurance companies... Because every aircraft that is in operation must be insured, the operational activities will be temporarily suspended until there is a further decision from shareholders.\"\nAdam Air's 2007 accidents, coupled with Garuda Indonesia , sparked an industry review that determined none of the nation's air carriers were safe. The United States subsequently warned against using Indonesian airlines, and they were all added to the list of air carriers banned in the EU."}

It was broadcast live on national television. \nObama said Rev. Jeremiah Wright's statements \"expressed a profoundly distorted view of this country \u2013 a view that sees white racism as endemic, and that elevates what is wrong with America above all that we know is right with America\". In one of Wright's more controversial sermons, he said blacks should damn America for mistreating and ignoring them.\n\"Reverend Wright\u2019s comments were not only wrong but divisive, divisive at a time when we need unity; racially charged at a time when we need to come together to solve a set of monumental problems,\" Obama said.\nHowever, Obama says he will continue to embrace his former pastor, if not his words. \"I can no more disown him than I can disown the black community,\" he said. \"I can no more disown him than I can my white grandmother ... a woman who once confessed her fear of black men who passed by her on the street ... These people are a part of me. And they are a part of America, this country that I love.\"\nObama, the son of a Kenyan man and a white woman, discussed how his race has affected his campaign. \"On one end of the spectrum, we\u2019ve heard the implication that my candidacy is somehow an exercise in affirmative action; that it\u2019s based solely on the desire of wide-eyed liberals to purchase racial reconciliation on the cheap,\" he said. \n\"On the other end, we\u2019ve heard my former pastor, Reverend Jeremiah Wright, use incendiary language to express views that have the potential not only to widen the racial divide, but views that denigrate both the greatness and the goodness of our nation\".\nHe also discussed the larger issue of race, and said that it is still an issue in the United States. \"The anger is real,\" he said, referring to the anger expressed by Wright and other blacks. \"It is powerful, and to simply wish it away, to condemn it without understanding its roots, only serves to widen the chasm of misunderstanding that exists between the races.\" \nHe also mentioned the resentment felt by many whites because of welfare and affirmative action. Though he says this resentment has often distracted America from the real problems whites and others face, he said that to label it as misguided or racist would only \"widen the racial divide\".\nObama described the current state of racial affairs in America as a \"stalemate we\u2019ve been stuck in for years\", but he says he has a conviction that \"we can move beyond some of our old racial wounds\" and \"continue on the path of a more perfect union\". \nHillary Clinton, also campaigning in Philadelphia, gave a positive comment about Barack's speech. \"Issues of race and gender in America have been complicated throughout our history, and they are complicated in this primary campaign,\" said Clinton. \"There have been detours and pitfalls along the way, but we should remember that this is a historic moment for the Democratic Party and for our country. We will be nominating the first African-American or woman for the presidency of the United States, and that is something that all Americans can and should celebrate.\"\nThe Internet's reaction to Obama's speech was immediate and pronounced. Adam Whittaker, a blogger from Brooklyn, New York, posted a supportive comment on Obama's campaign site. \"Obama went straight to the wound today,\" he wrote, \"but he didn't go with a bottle of acid or with the intentions to open the wound deeper. He went to the wound with precision and healing power of a surgeon, and he even sewed a stitch to begin the healing.\"\nA user from Yukon, Oklahoma named Brint said, \"Here we have a man who is half black, half white; a man who has experienced and embodies the concerns shared by both sides in racism, speaking frankly and intelligently on the issue.\"\nOthers were not so supportive. One YouTube user questioned why Obama had stayed close to Wright for so long. \"His words are not enough - he should have taken action years ago,\" the user commented. \"There's no room in this world for Wright's divisive teachings, and his financial and spiritual support of them over 20 years does not help his electability. \nAnother user wrote, \"Actions speak louder than words and Obama sat and listened to hate for a long time. Not even one of his great speeches can erase that.\"\nStill other observers argued that the controversy over Obama's former pastor was merely a distraction from the real issues that confront the American people: How to revive a sinking economy, end an unpopular war, and curb global warming. \n\"I'm more concerned with what Obama, Clinton, or McCain will do about jobs, education, global warming, the war, and the national debt than I am about this phony issue,\" one voter said after listening to the speech. \"This whole controversy was started by right-wingers trying to use race to divide us again.\""}

Yesterday, Bulgaria's security council held a meeting regarding Kosovo. Angel Naidenov, spokesman of the Bulgarian Socialist Party, praised Kosovo for their efforts in establishing a \"multi-ethnic and democratic country.\"\nThe statement says Kosovo's declaration of independence was prompted by the international community's failure to work out a solution between Serbia and Kosovo. \"In these circumstances the change of the unsustainable status quo was unavoidable,\" the statement said.\nThe three nations express their interest in helping the European Union with stabilizing the region, and they wish to develop ties with a Kosovo that \"maintains good relations with its neighbors, enjoys economic growth, and keeps its European orientation.\"\nSerbian foreign minister Vuk Jeremi\u0107 criticized their decision. \"Every country that decides to recognize the illegally declared state of Kosovo breaches international law,\" he said, adding that countries who recognize Kosovo \"cannot have good ties with Serbia.\" \n\"I call on states, particularly those of the region, not to take this step. Do not injure our country's territorial integrity and sovereignty,\" Jeremi\u0107 said.\nBoris Tadi\u0107, Serbia's president, had previously warned Croatia that recognizing Kosovo would have a negative effect on their relations. \"We want to have the best possible relations with this country,\" Tadi\u0107 said. \"But recognition of Kosovo is certainly not an act of goodwill between neighbours.\"\nCroatian Prime Minister Ivo Sanader says he does not expect relations to worsen. \"I do understand this is a difficult one for Serbia to swallow.

Bush, the President of the United States delivered today a speech regarding Iraq and the \"global war on terror.\" Bush claimed that the war in Iraq had been successful. He said that \"removing Saddam Hussein from power was the right decision \u2014 and this is a fight America can and must win.\" The speech marked five years since the start of the Iraq War.\nBush said that \"five years into this battle [the war in Iraq], there is an understandable debate over whether the war was worth fighting, whether the fight is worth winning, and whether we can win it. The answers are clear to me: Removing Saddam Hussein from power was the right decision \u2014 and this is a fight America can and must win.\" He continued saying that \"The men and women who crossed into Iraq five years ago removed a tyrant, liberated a country, and rescued millions from unspeakable horrors. Some of those troops are with us today, and you need to know that the American people are proud of your accomplishment -- and so is the Commander in Chief.\" This was followed by applause from the audience. \nBush also praised the troops who worked in Iraq. He said that \"operation Iraqi Freedom was a remarkable display of military effectiveness. Forces from the UK, Australia, Poland and other allies joined our troops in the initial operations. As they advanced, our troops fought their way through sand storms so intense that they blackened the daytime sky. Our troops engaged in pitched battles with the Fedayeen Saddam \u2014 death squads acting on the orders of Saddam Hussein that obeyed neither the conventions of war nor the dictates of conscience. These death squads hid in schools and they hid in hospitals, hoping to draw fire against Iraqi civilians. They used women and children as human shields. They stopped at nothing in their efforts to prevent us from prevailing \u2014 but they couldn't stop the coalition advance.\"\nIn the speech, the Iraqi elections were also mentioned. Bush said that \"over the past five years, we have seen moments of triumph and moments of tragedy. We have watched in admiration as 12 million Iraqis defied the terrorists and went to the polls, and chose their leaders in free elections. We have watched in horror as al-Qaeda beheaded innocent captives, and sent suicide bombers to blow up mosques and markets. These actions show the brutal nature of the enemy in Iraq. And they serve as a grim reminder: The terrorists who murder the innocent in the streets of Baghdad want to murder the innocent in the streets of America. Defeating this enemy in Iraq will make it less likely that we'll face the enemy here at home.\"\nBush claimed success in Iraq when he said that \"the successes we are seeing in Iraq are undeniable \u2014 yet some in Washington still call for retreat. War critics can no longer credibly argue that we're losing in Iraq \u2014 so now they argue the war costs too much. In recent months we've heard exaggerated estimates of the costs of this war. No one would argue that this war has not come at a high cost in lives and treasure \u2014 but those costs are necessary when we consider the cost of a strategic victory for our enemies in Iraq.\"\nBush concluded the speech by saying that \"The best way we can honor them [the US troops] is by making sure that their sacrifice was not in vain. Five years ago tonight, I promised the American people that in the struggle ahead, we will accept no outcome but victory. Today, standing before men and women who helped liberate a nation, I reaffirm the commitment. The battle in Iraq is noble, it is necessary, and it is just. And with your courage, the battle in Iraq will end in victory. God bless.\""}

The planet closely orbits HD 189733, a yellow dwarf star in the constellation Vulpecula.\nAlthough methane can play a key role in the chemical reactions needed to form life, the planet is too close to its parent star to support life, scientists say. It is known as a \"hot Jupiter\" - a planet whose mass is comparable to that of Jupiter, but orbits nearer to the parent star than Mercury, our Solar System's innermost planet. \nThis particular hot Jupiter takes just two days to completely orbit its parent star, and the temperatures in its atmosphere can reach 1,650 degrees Fahrenheit, around the melting point of silver.\n\"The methane here, although we can call it an organic constituent, is not produced by life - it is way too hot there for life,\" said Giovanna Tinetti, part of the NASA team that made the discovery.\nHowever, scientists believe the spectroscopic methods used to detect the methane can be used to find organic compounds on other distant planets. \"This observation is proof that spectroscopy can eventually be done on a cooler and potentially habitable Earth-sized planet orbiting a dimmer red dwarf-type star,\" said Mark Swain, a NASA scientist whose paper on the discovery will appear in the scientific journal \"Nature\".\nSpectroscopy is the splitting of light into its components. As the light from the star passed through the planet's atmosphere, the atmospheric gases imprinted their chemical signature onto the light, allowing the atmosphere's chemical composition to be analyzed by Near Infrared Camera and Multi-Object Spectrometer.\nTo their surprise, astronomers found much higher levels of methane than had been predicted for hot Jupiters. \"This indicates we don't really understand exoplanet atmospheres yet,\" said Swain.\nThis discovery also confirmed the presence of water molecules in the planet's atmosphere, which was found by NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope last year using spectroscopy. \"With this observation there is no question whether there is water or not - water is present,\" Swain said.\nThe ultimate goal of these studies is to identify the molecules of more Earth-like planets in the habitable zone of stars, where conditions may be favorable for life. \nAdam Showman at the University of Arizona said, \"We are thus now seeing but the opening salvo in a revolution that will extend humankind's view of planetary worlds far beyond the provincial boundaries of our Solar System.\"\nGiovanna Tinetti, who co-authored the \"Nature\" article, believes the concept of life on other planets is not too unlikely. \"My personal view is it is way too arrogant to think that we are the only ones living in the Universe,\" she says."}

The Ukrainian-built rocket lifted off from the Norwegian Ocean Odyssey launch platform in the Pacific Ocean at 22:47:59 (UTC) yesterday evening, with spacecraft separation from the carrier rocket occurring at 23:49:03. \nThe mission, which marked the 13th orbital launch of 2008, is the 25th commercial launch to be conducted by the international Sea Launch consortium, the first of which also lofted a DirecTV satellite. This is also the 250th flight of the Block DM upper stage, which is used on some variants of the Zenit and Proton rockets. Launch had been delayed from November 2007 due to damage to the launch platform caused by the failure of an earlier Zenit launch. Delays from earlier this month were caused by a problem with the satellite, resulting in a ten-day delay, and a further two-day delay from Monday evening due to an undisclosed problem with the rocket.\nDirecTV-11 is a Boeing 702 satellite, which will provide Direct-to-home High-definition television broadcasting services to houses in the United States, by means of Ka-band communications. It is one of three such satellites operated by DirecTV. The satellite made its first contact with the ground several hours after launch, at 05:44 GMT.\nThe launch was dedicated to Arthur C. Clarke who died on Tuesday. Clarke, who was most well known for writing the book which \"2001: A Space Odyssey\" was based on, was also the first person to suggest placing satellites into geosynchronous and geostationary orbits. DirecTV-11 will be placed into such an orbit.\nSea Launch President Rob Peckham said that he \"feels good\" about the mission success, and that Sea Launch was \"proud of [its] role in DirecTV's continued success\". Steve O'Neill, the President of Boeing Satellite Systems, said that the launch was \"a great ride\", and thanked Sea Launch for their \"excellent work\".\nThe satellite's initial orbit was confirmed to be 250km x 36484.8km x 0\u00b0, differing by only 2.8km from the planned orbit.\nSea Launch have a further four launches planned for this year. In addition, its subsidiary Land Launch will conduct its first launch, using a Zenit-3SLB rocket from area 45/1 at the Baikonur Cosmodrome to launch the AMOS-60 satellite. This is currently scheduled for mid-April. The next Sea Launch mission, with the Galaxy 18 satellite, is scheduled for May."}

New Prime Minister Yves Leterme was sworn in by King Albert II today, together with 15 new Ministers and 7 Secretaries of State. After the election on June 10 last year, a confidence vote in the parliament in Brussels on Saturday is expected to confirm the coalition's promise of a government in time before Easter.\nIn his inaugural speech, Flemish Christian Democrat Leterme replied to criticism from the media and opposition that his government's manifest was vague and that there was no mutual trust between the coalition partners: \"We want to increase the faith in the government, not with empty promises, but with specific measures, by investing in health care, the environment, safety and governmental services.\"\nThe coalition partners have set out several deadlines for major decisions on which agreement still could not be reached during the formation. By July 15, a council of 'wise men' has to fill the current empty space of the promised constitutional reforms. Yesterday, a survey published in the media showed that the majority of Belgians lacked confidence in the new government, and believed it will collapse within months. On a party convention yesterday, Leterme pledged he would keep his promise to his constituency, vowing to break up the government if more powers are not devolved to the regions.\nThe record-breaking political stalemate had promised to be difficult from the start, after the Christian Democrats won the elections in Flanders in coalition with the nationalist party N-VA. The cartel promised more regional autonomy for the northern Dutch-speaking two-thirds majority of Belgium. Negotiations promised to be tough in a country where separate parties for the main ideologies exist in each half of the country.\nLeader of the separatist N-VA Bart De Wever expressed his disdain about the new government: \"There are more Francophone than Dutch-speaking members in this administration, which doesn't respect the proportions: Flanders has two thirds of the population and three quarters of the wealth.\"\nDuring the political crisis the previous PM Guy Verhofstadt, who recognised his defeat in the elections and had seemingly withdrawn from the political stage, returned to head a caretaker government at the request of the Belgian King. In his inaugural speech today, the new PM expressed his gratefulness to Verhofstadt for his services. After almost 9 years as the Belgian PM, Verhofstadt presented his successor with the keys of his new residence at \"Rue de la Loi 16\"/\"Wetstraat 16\" (\"16 Law St.\"), in Brussels.\n'Madame No' Jo\u00eblle Milquet, leader of the Walloon Christian Democrats, gave her Flemish colleague Leterme a hard time during the coalition talks because she consistently resisted the Flemish demands for regional autonomy. In the new government she becomes the federal Minister of Work, a department that the Flemish nationalists want to devolve to the regional level.\nAs the largest political fraction, the liberals seem to have weighed heavily on the coalition. They deliver the vice-Premier and the Ministers for Constitutional Reforms, Finances, Economy, Internal and Foreign Affairs, Asylum and Migration, Agriculture, Sciences and Humanitarian Aid. The French-speaking socialists joined the coalition talks late in the process, while the Flemish socialists remain in the opposition, giving an unprecedented asymmetry to the federal government."}

One blogger described it as \"the MySpace of politics\".\nCandidates create a profile, where they outline their platform and expound their views on subjects ranging from global warming and immigration to religion and conspiracy theories. Just like in other social networking sites, candidates can leave comments on others' profiles; they can also rate other candidates on a scale of 1 to 10 and become a supporter of another campaign. All of this is factored into a candidate's rating, which ultimately determines who will become the next virtual President of the United States.\nEric Gurr, creator of U4Prez.com, says you shouldn't be fooled be the site's MySpace-like facade. \"It's all about the politics,\" he says. \"I think most of our users have accounts on MySpace and Facebook, and use U4prez strictly for the political dialogue.\" \"Wikinews\" conducted an email interview with Gurr, in which he discussed how the site works, how the Internet has affected politics, and who he is endorsing for President.\nInterview.\nWhat compelled you to create U4Prez.com?\nEric Gurr: I was having a discussion with a business co-hort and I had suggested that the average Joe was probably better able to be president of the United States than many of the politicians considering running. This was back in 2006. I had at about this same time read the book Wikinomics. My first inclination was to create a wiki, on how to solve political problems. But the social networking side was a more natural fit.\nHave you had any prior experience in politics or political studies?\nEG: No I really haven't. I've never run for office, and never really been a part of a campaign. I read quite a bit and I'm a bit of a polymath when it comes to history and economics. When I read a book like Freedom from Fear, or Modern Times by Paul Johnson, I check the footnotes. When I read an article on-line, for some reason I have an inclination to check up on the author to see if his facts are right.\nWhat goes on in a typical U4Prez candidate\u2019s campaign?\nEG: We have three distinct profiles. The quick drive by profile with little information, the interested candidate who probably posts once or twice a week, and the die-hards. The die hards of course drive the site. These candidates are passionate and amazingly well informed. \nWhat measures are taken to stop trolling and prevent heated debates from becoming too heated?\nEG: In the first couple of months we had to moderate the site twenty four hours a day. As the election has heated up this has oddly become less of a concern. We never censor political thought, but we do put dirty word filters in place. The dialogue gets heated, but almost never crosses the line. I've been contacted by ABC News, slate.com and quite a few other news outlets and their first impression is that this is just a bunch of college kids arguing about things they don't understand. The reality is quite different. The debate is structured in caucuses, and we occasionally hold moderated debates between specific candidates. The average age of the candidates is about 35, so this is a much more serious crowd than you would suppose.\nHow is a candidate\u2019s rating calculated? What specific factors are taken into account?\nEG: Candidates must campaign. The core score is ratings by other candidates on a scale of 1 to 10. But this is only about 70% of total score. After six months of use, we developed a voting algorithm based on how members were using the site. You could literally have a perfect score of ten from members, and never get in to a runoff. You have to debate the issues, you have to visit and vote on other candidates platforms. In other words, you need to campaign. This boosts your candidate rank and overall score.\nWere any of the real-life candidates\u2019 profiles created by the candidates themselves?\nEG: Not to my knowledge. I have seen in the log files that many of the candidates' campaigns have visited the site. Many of the profiles from the real-life candidates were created by us early in the process. We simply pulled the information from their official sites. That said, many of the third party or independent candidate profiles are created by the candidates themselves, or their staffs.\nMany of the top-rated candidates on your site are independent or third party candidates. Why is this the case online but not in real life?\nEG: It has to do with viability. We took a survey several months ago and found that many of the candidates who were professed third party supporters intended to vote for either a Democrat or Republican in the real election.\nDo you think most users take the site\u2019s political aspects seriously, or are they more interested in the social networking aspect?\nEG: It's all about the politics. I think most of our users have accounts on MySpace and Facebook, and use U4prez strictly for the political dialogue. \nIn your opinion, has the internet has significantly affected the way presidential elections unfold?\nEG: Absolutely. The support and money raised by Ron Paul ultimately led to the nomination of John McCain. The more traditionally conservative candidates lost millions to Paul. This was entirely an internet phenomenon. Because of the communication capabilities of the web, people who have a strong interest in politics naturally migrate to the web. At u4prez for example, our members aren't likely voters, they are voters. This is true for just about any politically oriented site. Some of the candidates are picking up on this and using the web to deliver truly custom messages directly to real voters.\nHow do you think the internet will affect politics in the 2012 election and beyond?\nEG: The influence of certain websites will grow exponentially. The big question is what will the impact of the bloggers become? We are rolling out a new feature on the site in the next couple of weeks to allow our members to rate political blogs. As of now, there is no clearinghouse for political blogs. We are going to fill a big gap with this feature. The print media decline will continue and probably accelerate. To help this process along we as members of the web community need a way to vet new content and content creators.&lt;br&gt;\nIs there any political issue that you feel has been overlooked by the media?\nEG: The baby-boomers. In January of 2008 the first baby-boomer became eligible for social security. In the next twenty years about 80 million more will follow. Extrapolating the math is pretty easy. In about fifteen short years the entire budget (as it stands now) will need to go to social security, Medicare and the prescription drug benefit. This of course isn't going to happen. This is a huge issue because 80 million people are going to be voting to protect those programs.&lt;br&gt;\nLastly, who are you endorsing for president and why? \nEG: As a website, U4prez endorsed Ron Paul. This came from the members of the site. Personally, it's hard for me to visualize anyone running right now who has the vision and can put the problems facing the economy in to any kind of historical context. I can tell you this. There are five thousand members on U4prez, and just a handful of them fully support any of the current candidates. I'm starting to get a pretty strong indication that someone is going to make a real third party run. The Democrats are going to come out of their convention divided that much is now obvious. But the media have overlooked the division within the Republican party over John McCain. Ross Perot made a huge impact on the election in 1992, and there was relative calm in the nation. 2008 may really be the year a third party candidate emerges at the last minute and wins the election. It's not likely, but neither is it a long-shot."}

Currently only three other moons, all from Jupiter, have been found to have known water sources. Ganymede, Callisto and Europa are so far the only known moons with a water source.\nMembers of the mission's science team used Cassini's Synthetic Aperture Radar to collect imaging data during 19 separate passes over Titan between October 2005 and May 2007. The radar can see through Titan's dense, methane-rich atmospheric haze, detailing never-before-seen surface features and establishing their locations on the moon's surface.\nUsing data from the radar's early observations, the scientists and radar engineers established the locations of 50 unique landmarks on Titan's surface. They then searched for these same lakes, canyons and mountains in the reams of data returned by Cassini in its later flybys of Titan. They found prominent surface features had shifted from their expected positions by up to 30 kilometers (19 miles). A systematic displacement of surface features would be difficult to explain unless the moon's icy crust was decoupled from its core by an internal ocean, making it easier for the crust to move.\nCassini scientists will not have long to wait before another go at Titan. On March 25, just prior to its closest approach at an altitude of 1,000 kilometers (620 miles), Cassini will employ its Ion and Neutral Mass Spectrometer to examine Titan's upper atmosphere. Immediately after closest approach, the spacecraft's Visual and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer will capture high-resolution images of Titan's southeast quadrant. \nThe study of Titan is a major goal of the Cassini-Huygens mission because it may preserve, in deep-freeze, many of the chemical compounds that preceded life on Earth. Titan is the only moon in the solar system that possesses a dense atmosphere. The moon's atmosphere is 1.5 times denser than Earth's. Titan is the largest of Saturn's moons, bigger than the planet Mercury. "}

Alexander, the movie has been characterized by critics as a parody of Scientology and of its founder L. Ron Hubbard. Alexander was a Scientologist for twenty years, and left the organization in 1997. The film was funded by Bob Minton, a former critic of Scientology who later signed an agreement with the Church of Scientology and has attempted to stop distribution of the film. Alexander has stated that the movie is based on his research into cults, and when asked by the \"St. Petersburg Times\" about parallels to Scientology and L. Ron Hubbard said: \"I'll let you draw that conclusion ... I say it's entirely fictional.\"\nThe film was released in August 2001, and was shown at a movie theatre in Clearwater, Florida and at a premiere at the Cannes Film Festival in France. A Scientology spokesman gave a statement at the time saying \"the movie is fiction and has nothing to do with Scientology\". The Church of Scientology later took legal action in an attempt to stop further distribution of the film. The Church of Scientology claimed that the film was intended to influence the jury pool in the wrongful death case of Scientologist Lisa McPherson, who died under Scientology care in Clearwater, Florida. \nIn April 2002, a Pinellas County, Florida judge issued a court order enjoining \"The Profit\" from worldwide distribution for an indefinite period. According to the original court injunction received by \"Wikinews\", the movie was originally banned because the court found that it could be seen as a parody of Scientology. In his April 20, 2002 ruling on the injunction, Judge Robert E. Beach of the Sixth Judicial Circuit Court in Pinellas County, Florida wrote: \"...an average person viewing the film entitled \"The Profit\" could perceive that it is a parody of the Church of Scientology\". \n\"To the extent that any person considered as a potential juror in evaluating any issues involving the Church of Scientology, the process of voir dire provides a fair and complete remedy to eliminate any potential juror that may possibly have been influenced to be less than fair and impartial,\" added Beach.\nLuke Lirot, the attorney for the film's production company, announced on the film's website on April 7, 2007 that \"We have absolutely no exposure for any repercussions from the court order,\" but that the film was still blocked from distribution due to an ongoing legal battle. Lirot wrote: \"all that's stopping the release of the movie is the legal battle with the partner who was compromised by Scientology (Robert Minton) and is currently using his power as partner to stop the release of the film.\"\nIn an October 2007 article, \"The Times\" described the film as \"banned in the US because of a lawsuit taken out against it by The Church of Scientology,\" and Russ Kick's \"The Disinformation Book of Lists\" included the film in his \"List of 16 Movies Banned in the U.S.\". An 8-minute teaser segment from \"The Profit\" appeared on the film's website and on the video sharing site YouTube in February 2008, and an attorney representing Bob Minton sent a letter to Luke Lirot requesting that the film clip be taken down. In a response letter, Lirot wrote that \"Rather than damage any asset of the LLC, the short clip merely keeps the film in the public eye, and in a positive way.\"\nOn Friday, copies of the film began to circulate on peer-to-peer file-sharing websites and on YouTube. A link related to the film's appearance on the Internet on the community-based link aggregator website Digg.com had 3,638 \"Diggs\" - and hit the front page of the site's Entertainment section on Saturday. \nOn Saturday, Scientology critic and Emmy award-winning journalist Mark Bunker put a streaming version of the film on his website, www.xenutv.com, and encouraged others to watch and discuss the film on a real-time chat channel. In a video posting to YouTube Saturday, Bunker said \"I did not do it. I had nothing to do with it ... I had nothing to do with this release at all. But I'm happy it's out there ... people are finally having a chance to see it. A lot of people have been curious over the years and there's been a lot of interest in seeing the film, so finally you can.\"\nOn the newsgroup alt.religion.scientology, a poster by the username \"Alexia Death\" commented on the film's appearance on the Internet in the context of censorship: \"It is out! And so it is a WIN if many people review it even if they say it SUCKS! ... Being bad is no cause to allow censorship ... And being censored is no cause to assume its good\". A post to the blog \"Blogsreel\" commented: \"We have all wanted to see this movie that scientology kept hidden away from us. We have all wondered just how damning could this story be that we were banned from watching it.\" \nIn a post on Sunday to the message board attached to the official website for the film, attorney Luke Lirot asked that individuals stop distributing copies of \"The Profit\" over the Internet. Lirot wrote: \"It has been brought to my attention that several unauthorized transmissions and downloads of this protected work have taken place over the last 72 hours. Such actions are copyright violations and are unlawful. I request that any further distribution and/or dissemination of this important work cease immediately and any copies of the work that have been downloaded please be deleted.\" In his statement, Lirot recognized the rights of individuals under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, but also said that unauthorized distribution of the film \"will only serve to harm the goal of vast distribution\".\nBlog postings have attributed the film's appearance on the Internet as part of the anti-Scientology movement Project Chanology organized by the Internet-based group Anonymous, but this has not been confirmed. \"Wikinews\" previously reported on international protests against Scientology which took place as part of Project Chanology on and March 15. A third international protest by Anonymous is scheduled for April 12. Titled \"Operation Reconnect\", the third international protest will focus on highlighting Scientology's practice of disconnection."}

Cheney noted \"Terror and rockets do not merely kill innocent civilians, they also kill the legitimate hopes and aspirations of the Palestinian people.\"\nThe Vice President remarked he is committed towards a Palestinian state, quoting President George W. Bush, \"The establishment of the state of Palestine is long overdue. The Palestinian people deserve it.\" Cheney also noted that \"Achieving that vision will require tremendous effort at the negotiating table and painful concessions on both sides.\"\n Abbas condemned rocket attacks against Israel from the Hamas-controlled Gaza Strip, but also told Israel to ease their restrictions on Palestinians. He also noted that Israel needs to stop building settlements within the West Bank. Abbas noted that, \"Peace and stability will not be achieved through a settlement expansion, or the setting up of checkpoints around towns and villages, and the military escalation against Gaza, nor the incursions, continuous incursions into West Bank villages and towns.\"\nCheney met earlier in the day with Shimon Peres, the Israeli president.

Nobody can console us and say that the declarations of Ahmadinejad are less serious than they are; we have to take it seriously, out of experience.\" \nCheney noted that the Bush administration is pledged to the peace process and also referenced Iran but not directly, \"We're obviously dedicated to doing all we can as an administration to try to move the peace process forward, and also obviously actively involved in dealing with the threats that we see emerging in the region -- not only threats to Israel, but threats to the United States, as well.\"\nCheney met with Prime Minister Olmert on Saturday and told Olmert that, \"The United States will never pressure Israel to take steps that threaten its security.\" He also told Olmert that the United States backs Israel's right to defend itself from Hamas rocket attacks but that America was also working for a peace deal between Israel and the moderate Fatah-controlled Palestinian government in the West Bank.\nAbbas lost control of the Gaza Strip to the rival Hamas party last year. Abbas, who is the leader of the more moderate Fatah party currently runs the Palestinian government located in the West Bank, the other Palestinian territory."}

A fifth soldier was wounded. Following standard procedure, the identities of those killed have been withheld pending notification of relatives.\nThe milestone was reached just days after the fifth anniversary of the start of the war on March 19, 2003 when the United States and the United Kingdom invaded Iraq \"to disarm Iraq of weapons of mass destruction (WMD), to end Saddam Hussein's support for terrorism, and to free the Iraqi people.\" However, no weapons of mass destruction have been located yet.\nA military spokesman, Navy Lt. Patrick Evans, gave condolences to the family and noted each death is \"equally tragic.\" Evans also added, \"There have been some significant gains. However, this enemy is resilient and will not give up, nor will we. There's still a lot of work to be done.\"\nThe U.S. military says that in 2007, 901 soldiers and personnel were killed, which made that year the deadliest year for U.S. troops since the beginning of the war.\nThis occurred on the same day when Mowaffak al-Rubaie, the current Iraqi National Security Advisor said that \"This war is well worth fighting,\" on CNN's \"Late Edition with Wolf Blitzer\".\n\"This is global terrorism hitting everywhere and they have chosen Iraq to be a battlefield.

In Baghdad, mortars or rockets were fired into the high-security \"Green Zone.\" Meanwhile, a suicide bomber killed six people in Shula, one Baghdad's Shia neighborhoods. Also, gunmen in seven cars open fired in a mixed neighborhood of Baghdad killing seven people.\nMeanwhile, 13 Iraqi soldiers were killed at an army base by a suicide truck bomber and another four were killed by a roadside bomb in Tuz Khurmato.\nThe death toll of Iraqi civilians is estimated to be around 80,000 to 150,000 or more.

Preoccupation with a malfunction of the Inertial Reference System diverted both pilot's attention from the flight instruments and allowed the increasing descent and bank angle to unnoticed...\n\"The Cockpit Voice recorder revealed that both pilots were concerned about navigation problems and subsequently become engrossed with trouble shooting Inertial Reference System (IRS) anomalies for at least the last 13 minutes of the flight, with minimal regard to other flight requirements. This included identification and attempts at corrective actions.\"\nHe also supplied a number of statistics concerning the final moments of the flight. Whilst in a right bank with sustained elevator input pushing up the nose the aircraft reached Mach 0.926 and 3.5g. The airspeed had reached 490 KCAS by the end of the recording. Investigator Santoso Sayogo said that the high speed impact caused the plane to disintegrate.\nAdam Air had suffered previous navigational problems. In 2006 another B737 suffered a navigational problem and flew into a radar blackspot, leaving it lost for several hours before performing an emergency landing hundreds of miles from the intended destination. Sayogo said today that in the three months preceding the accident the airline had registered 154 defects in PK-KKW's navigational equipment.\nThe accident has had wide-ranging effects. The crash, coupled with Adam Air Flight 172, which snapped in half during a hard landing, and Garuda Indonesia Flight 200, which overshot the runway in Yogyakarta, killing 21, prompted the European Union to add all Indonesia's airlines to the list of air carriers banned in the EU. Earlier this month another Adam Air flight departed the end of a runway during landing, injuring five and damaging the plane. This prompted the authorities to ground Adam Air for three months after a regular evaluation, after which they may be permanently shut down. The airline is also in financial difficulty. All the accidents involved Boeing 737s."}

Large crowds showed up at Westpac Stadium to see the various acts. The world has never seen an event of this kind before.\nDay one featured three theatrical acts. Finnish band Lordi, known for their monster costumes, opened the night. They were followed by the US shock rocker Alice Cooper, whose themed set included the horror theatrics regularly associated with him and a hanging stunt he recently restarted after a gallows collapse nearly killed him two decades ago. The night was headlined by the distinctively costumed band KISS, complete with their famed black-and-white makeup.\nThe first major act on the stage on day two was the American hard rock/glam metal band Poison. After Poison, British act Whitesnake took to the stage and performed their set to the crowd. British-born American rocker Ozzy Osbourne, who, as well as a solo career, fronts the world-famous Black Sabbath, was the second night's headline act.\nThe festival's entertainment did not stop at the six main acts. There was also support performances from three New Zealand bands - The Symphony of Screams, The Valves and Sonic Altar. Their sets were accompanied by a special effects package from award-winning studio Weta Workshops, who are known for their work on movies such as The Lord of the Rings film trilogy. This came in the form of 'Drusila the Dragon', which rose up to a height of six foot and wigspan and moved for the audience, shining lasers from its eyes and breathing red smoke. Flame Fire Productions were hired to put on a fire show featuring several dancers alongside the performers. Also performing were six local guitarists and a group of 'zombie' cheerleaders.\nDespite the crowds that flocked to the event, however, it has recently become apparent that financial trouble has hit the festival. Although figures remain to be confirmed, an estimated NZ$750,000 has been lost.\nWikinews secured an exclusive interview with Phil Sprey of Capital C Concerts, who organised the festival. The entire interview is now available below.\nInterview.\nWhat initially gave you the idea to stage New Zealand's first rock festival?\nHow did you select the acts that would be performing and the other entertainment on offer? What are your personal opinions on the artists present?\nIs it true that Ozzy demanded the set be repainted from KISS colours to his own?\nWhat kind of reaction has there been from fans and the media to the festival?\nThree-quarters of a million dollars is a huge loss. Why is the quantity so large if ticket sales were still relatively high, even if they were below anticipated levels? How much did it cost to hire each of the acts present, anyway?\nWho is going to pay the price now?\nYou believe Easter trading restrictions are responsible for low sales. Might we then see a future Rock2Wgtn at a different time of the year? If so, what can we expect from it?\nWhy were Easter restrictions not factored into plans before the festival?\nThere were also 20 related arrests for minor offences. What are your comments on this? Do you feel negative media attention from this may be an issue for Capital C Concerts?\nWhat other events are you planning for the future?\nWhat would you like to say to any fans reading this now?"}

In addition to keeping the #1 spot every week since December 1988, \"Y&amp;R\" has also been the top-rated soap in the African-American demographic since 1991. \nA trend-setter since the beginning, \"Y&amp;R\" relied on character-driven storytelling, accentuated with understated sexuality from its cast, which at that time was mostly young, in order to bring in teenage and twentysomething viewers who were ignored by soap producers and networks up to that time. These traits immediately set \"Y&amp;R\" apart from other soap operas, and other soaps have since mimicked \"Y&amp;R\"'s formulaic approach to offering something for everyone, especially younger viewers. \nSince premiering on March 26, 1973, \"Y&amp;R\" has become a worldwide cultural institution in its own right, racking up an impressive 100 Emmy Awards between the writers, producers, cast and crew since 1974. The show has aired in over 100 countries, including Australia, New Zealand, France, Germany, Italy, and Turkey, and reaches a worldwide audience of ten million daily. So far-reaching was \"Y&amp;R\"'s appeal that Romanian gymnast Nadia Comaneci chose the serial's theme song as accompanying music to her floor exercises at the 1976 Summer Olympics. In Australia, where \"Y&amp;R\" has aired since 1974, the show was canceled by the original network that aired it in 2007, prompting a widespread fan backlash in that country. It was quickly moved to a pay channel.\nOver the past 35 years, countless characters, marriages, divorces, births, deaths, and every joy and trauma in between have visited the residents of Genoa City, where \"Y&amp;R\" is set. To commemorate the milestone, from \"Wikinews\" interviewed three actresses who have played long-running characters on \"Y&amp;R\", and asked them to share their memories. All three responded to questions about what being on \"Y&amp;R\" means to them, what their favorite storylines were, what they perhaps would have wanted to do all over again, and what they'd love to tell their fans directly.\nBelow are portions of all three interviews. \nWikinews interviews \"Y&amp;R\" cast members.\nThroughout March, Mike Halterman spoke to three \"Y&amp;R\" actresses: Melody Thomas Scott, who has portrayed Nikki Newman since 1979; Michelle Stafford, who has portrayed Phyllis Summers Newman since 1994; and Tricia Cast, who portrayed Nina Webster from 1986 to 2001.\nQuestions asked to all three.\nMike Halterman: How do you feel about the way the show has evolved from the day you started the show, to what it is now?\nMike Halterman: What does being associated with Y&amp;R mean to you? What's the one thing you feel has impacted your life for the better from your association with the show?\nMike Halterman: In terms of writing and depth of character, do you think your character is stronger now than she was, say, a decade ago?\nMike Halterman: Out of all the storylines you've been involved in, which one was your favorite?\nMike Halterman: ...which one was your least favorite?\nMike Halterman: If you had the power to bring one past character back to the show, who would you bring back and why?\nMike Halterman: How do you feel about the rise of unscripted shows which indirectly breed dramatic situations, like \"Big Brother\" and \"Starting Over\"? Do you think the rise of reality programming is \"bad for business\" as far as the daytime dramas go?\nMike Halterman: What do you feel is the one major reason for the show staying at the top of the ratings for 19 years? Do you feel you contributed to the show's ratings strength in some fashion?\nMike Halterman: Do you feel Y&amp;R, through its longevity and popularity, has influenced other shows? \nQuestions asked to Melody Thomas Scott.\nMike Halterman: Twenty-nine years in any job is a long time. What made you stick with it as long as you have?\nMike Halterman: You remarked in \"Soap Opera Digest\" last year that you get disappointed when your character doesn't get featured regularly in her own story. With that said, did you ever want to just end your involvement with Y&amp;R and do other things?\nMike Halterman: Nikki and Victor have spent many happy years together, but 2008 has seen the couple divorce for a fourth time. Why so much volatility? \nMike Halterman: Do you feel there should be a happy ending for Nikki and Victor?\nMike Halterman: Your character went from stripper to socialite. How do you feel this change deepened the facets of your character's personality?\nMike Halterman: How do you feel about being recognized not only in the U.S., but abroad as well?\nMike Halterman: Some of your fans are new to the show, and others have watched since you first appeared in 1979. What would you like to say as an end note to all of your fans?\nQuestions asked to Michelle Stafford.\nMike Halterman: You've been working at Y&amp;R eleven years across two separate stints. That kind of tenure in any job is a long time. What made you stick with it as long as you have?\nMike Halterman: Do you think Phyllis and Nicholas have a fighting chance, or will Phyllis be doomed to losing the men she loves, like with Danny and Jack?\nMike Halterman: Phyllis had a lot of foils and enemies in the series, like Christine, Drucilla, and Diane. Which one of those women do you think is Phyllis's epic foil? \nMike Halterman: You've won two Emmy Awards, both from separate and distinct parts in your story. Out of the work which got you both Emmy Awards, which do you feel was your strongest body of work, the one you received on your first stint, or the one you got for your current stint?\nMike Halterman: Do you think Y&amp;R should make more use of umbrella storylines, like the recent \"Out of the Ashes\" event?\nMike Halterman: Some of your fans are new to the show, and others have watched since you first appeared in 1994, and others have watched since the show first started. What would you like to say as an end note to all of your fans?\nQuestions asked to Tricia Cast.\nMike Halterman: In terms of writing and depth of character, where do you think Nina was at her strongest throughout her time in Genoa City? And what was her weakest point?\nMike Halterman: Nina's best friend on the show was Christine, and in many respects, Christine's personality served as a contrast to Nina's. Why do you think those two kept a strong friendship as long as they did?\nMike Halterman: Over the last couple of years, history was rewritten so that Philip, Nina's first husband, wasn't really Jill's son at all. What does that say to you as far as Nina ever coming back to the show? Do you find it disheartening that the show's history was rewritten to that degree?\nMike Halterman: You won one Emmy Award, for the bulk of your storyline involving David Kimble. What were some pros and cons in acting that emotional story?\nMike Halterman: Many fans would deem the character of Nina as the \"beleaguered heroine.\" Do you think that assessment is on the mark, or were there other facets to her character that you feel were integral to your portrayal of her that deserve note?\nMike Halterman: For a time while you were on the show, you (and Nina) gained some weight. In the storyline, Ryan had left Nina for Tricia [Dennison, played by Sabryn Genet], and she became convinced she was unattractive and unloved. Was that a difficult storyline to act out? Also, what kind of fan reaction did you receive while playing that sort of storyline, as it related to female viewers and their own self-image concerns?\nMike Halterman: With the advent of the Internet, soap fans have mobilized and fought to make their voices heard like never before. Do you feel fans may be more rigid to change and evolution in their soap operas more so network and company heads, who are sometimes accused of being out of touch?\nMike Halterman: Out of all of your former colleagues, who do you still keep in touch with?\nMike Halterman: If you were asked tomorrow to reprise your role on Y&amp;R, would you do it? \nMike Halterman: Now that you're no longer with Y&amp;R, many of your fans don't know what you've been up to. Can you bring us up to speed as to what you've been doing since leaving the show?\nMike Halterman: Is there any special message you'd like to say as an end note to all of your fans?"}

Although some portions of the manual have been leaked previously, this is believed to be the first time the full unedited version has been leaked.\nThe file is a 612-page compilation of material written for Scientologists by L. Ron Hubbard, and contains instructions for the eight different Operating Thetan levels including 'clear' and OT8. Most of the documents have been retyped from their original sources. The file does, however, contain some scanned in Hubbard's own handwriting, which also bear his signature. The collection also contains bulletins by Hubbard written for individuals who have passed the according levels.\n\"A great many phenomena (strange things) can happen while doing these drills, if they are done honestly,\" Hubbard writes in regards to 'OT1.' Hubbard then goes on to explain in hand written notes, the 'drills' one must do in order to become 'OT1':\n\"One: Walk around and counts bodies until you have a cognition. Make a report saying how many you counted and your cognition. Two: Note several large and small female bodies until you have a cognition. Note it down. Three: Note several large and several small male bodies until you have a cognition. Note it down. Four: Final a tight packed crowd of people. Write it as a crowd and then as individuals until you have a cognition. Note it down. Do step over until you do.\"\nHubbard then goes on to explain OT2, but before he does so, he tells the Churches how to keep Scientology working. One way is to not divulge information on their \"technology.\" Doing so, says Hubbard, would result in \"the complete destruction of all our work.\"\n\"On the other hand there have been thousands and thousands of suggestions and writings which, if accepted and acted upon, would have resulted in the complete destruction of all our work. Our technology has not been discovered by a group. True, if the group had not supported me in many ways, I could not have discovered it either. But it remains that if in its formative stages it was not discovered by a group, then group efforts, one can safely assume, will not add to it or successfully alter it in the future,\" states Hubbard in a confidential letter dated February 7, 1965.\nHubbard also goes on to say that \"man has never before evolved workable mental technology and emphasizing it is the vicious technology he did evolve\u2014psychiatry, psychology, surgery, shock treatment, whips, duress, punishment, etc., ad infinitum.\" Hubbard also says that \"war, famine, agony and disease has been the lot of Man\" and that Man \"has been what has made Earth a Hell\u2014and if you were looking for Hell and found Earth, it would certainly serve.\"\nHubbard calls those 'men' \"SP Body Thetans\" or those who \"are out of valance\" and who are \"stuck to\nanother thetan or body but is not in control\" with Scientology. Some he says are even \"psychotic, serve faces and have fixed ideas\" which \"inhibits recovery.\" Thetan is derived from the Greek word \"Theta\" which means \"thought or life.\"\n\"An individual being such as a man is a thetan, he is not a body and he does not think because he has no brain,\" states Hubbard.\nIt is not until 'OT3' when you learn the true beginning of Scientology. In Hubbard's own hand written notes, he begins to describe a series of \"76 planets [orbiting] around larger stars founded 95,000,000 years ago\" which he says \"are visible from here [Earth].\"\nFrom those planets, which were over-populated by \"about 250 million per planet,\" came a \"head of the Galactic Federation\" named 'Xenu' who solved the overpopulation by sending vast numbers of his people to Earth somewhere between \"75,000,000 and 4 qadrillion \"[Sic]\" years ago.\" Hubbard says that he brought them to Earth and dropped them off inside volcanoes on an island he describes as Hawaii in the Pacific Ocean. Xenu then captured the ones who escaped after 36 days and exploded the remaining individuals with a hydrogen bomb. Xenu was later \"captured after six years of battle\" and Earth had since become a \"desert.\"\nIt is also said at this level, an implant, in what Hubbard calls an \"engram\" will be given in which the individual can \"see pictures.\" However these pictures are not to be \"stuck\" or permanent.\nAt 'OT4' individuals are allegedly rid of illegal and legal drugs. Documents state that addicts are not treated with drugs, but simply not given anything.\n\"As drugs and drug incidents have been so common on the whole track, to simply generally ask for drugs or drug incidents when dealing with BTs and clusters, could cause a total restim,\" states the document which then says that individuals are made to wait out the effects of the drugs. Another process used to try and stop drug use is to \"take any previously given Drug somatic items, or newly list any additional items connected with reading drugs, medicines, etc., and assess for reading somatic item.\" Hubbard insists that these methods are proven effective.\n'OT5' is when individuals learn about the \"physical universe, not the laws of physical scientists, but the basic considerations about Matter, Energy, Space and Time,\" states Hubbard.\nAt 'OT6' a Scientologist is alleged to develop skills of telepathy and skills attained at 'OT7' are claimed to include the \"rehabilitation of ability to project intention.\" The final level of the series, 'OT8', is intended to produce \"have full certainty and, therefore, perception on all\" of your issues. \n\"Wikileaks\" previously published documents relating to the Church of Scientology's division the Office of Special Affairs. The 208-page document released March 9 details Scientology's involvement in black propaganda according to its \"Fair Game\" practices."}

Simply put, it was a transition from reality to reality, with a two-week detour in reality television. Somerville was a former contestant on the CBS reality TV staple \"Big Brother\", currently in its ninth installment. \nEvicted on Day 14, Somerville hoped to have another chance to play the game, but came in second in the special \"America's Choice\" poll to bring back a former HouseGuest (the poll results were eventually not used at all and nobody was brought back). Now freed from a three-week sequester, Somerville was interviewed by \"Wikinews\" reporter and he discussed his thoughts on \"Big Brother\", how he and his fellow HouseGuests were portrayed and received, and what he plans to do now that his experience is, for the most part, over.\nSomerville will return to \"Big Brother\" on finale night in five weeks. Please check your local listings for time and channel. \"Big Brother\" airs on CBS in the United States, Global in Canada, and E4 in the United Kingdom.\nStarting in reality.\nMike Halterman: So, you've been billed on the show as a paparazzi for TMZ.com. Tell us exactly what you do at your job. What was your most exciting work-related celebrity sighting?\nMH: How much exposure did you have to Big Brother before you were selected to go on the show?\nMH: Who influenced you to audition?\nMH: In a previous interview I conducted with \"Canada's Next Top Model\" winner Andrea Muizelaar, she said that she believed reality shows cast people who are perhaps unstable, to make for better television. Do you feel that's true? \n\"The detour\".\nMH: You were really not that thrilled when Jen, the \"soulmate\" the show picked for you, was in a previous outside relationship with fellow HouseGuest Ryan. What were you thinking when Jen revealed the news to you? \nMH: Also, Allison, Ryan's partner, was shown on the television broadcasts as being probably more angry than you were. Who do you think was more angry about the developments, you or Allison?\nMH: You were involved in some of the most dramatic moments we've seen this season, including, but not limited to, you waking up the entire house to find the person who had talked behind your back. Do you think being that direct was a good strategy for your game play? Also, viewers of the show gathered that you were unhappy with the way Jen played the game, but do you believe some of your actions cost you the game as well?\nMH: How do you feel about Jen telling other HouseGuests that her real-life boyfriend Ryan was racist to ensure that she stayed in the game? Did you think that behavior crossed a line?\nMH: You had said after leaving the house that you felt Matt didn't keep his word to you as far as vetoing your nomination. Now that you've watched past footage, do you still believe Matt wronged you?\nMH: What did you really want to say to Jen after you both got evicted so early in the game? You were very quiet when Julie Chen interviewed both of you...\nComing full circle back to reality.\nMH: This season, \"Big Brother\" made the press rather negatively compared to past seasons, specifically with incidents like HouseGuest Adam being fired from his job for a comment about \"retards,\" Amanda being taunted that she should hang herself with a noose \"just like her father,\" and James performing in multiple gay pornography videos. What are your thoughts about all of these these events? When do you think the other HouseGuests will find out about James' past in pornography, if they find out at all? How do you think Chelsia will react?\nMH: You were kept in sequester for a few weeks, and only recently allowed to return to your normal life. How does it feel being recognized as \"that guy from the Big Brother show\"?\nMH: What options, do you feel, are open to you now that your stint on reality TV is over? Are you going to continue your job at TMZ, or do you hope to break into acting like previous HouseGuests have?\nMH: You were in the \"Big Brother\" house for all of 14 days. With that TV experience behind you, would you ever consider doing another reality TV show again?\nMH: Who would you hang out with after the show ends, and who would you rather not see again? \nMH: There are eight contestants left from the original sixteen. Who are you rooting for to win, and why?\nMH: And finally, do you believe the \"Big Brother\" \"twist\" this season (both the \"soulmate\" pairings and Jen and Ryan's outside relationship) \"robbed\" you of winning the game?

They joined the nearly 1,500 African Union forces from Sudan and Tanzania, with Libya, France, and the United States providing logistical support for the operation.\nThe Comoros government says they have already captured most of the island. \"The operation started in the early morning hours and it is going smoothly and according to plan,\" said Abdourahim Said Bakar, a government spokesman. \"The military has taken control over most of the island - the airport and Anjouan's capital, Mutsamudu.\" \nThere have been no official reports of casualties, but two African Union soldiers appear to have suffered minor injuries, and one reporter saw an elderly man being carried away after apparently being hit by a stray bullet. Sounds of machine guns and heavy artillery could be heard throughout the island.\nMohamed Bacar seized control of Anjouan in a 2001 military coup. After his term expired in 2007, he held his own elections in which he declared himself the winner. This election was viewed as illegal by Comoros and the African Union.\n\"We hope that by the end of the day we will have the problem resolved,\" the government spokesman said. \"A special group has been selected to capture Bacar, arrest him and bring him to court. He has to pay for his crimes.\" \nThe spokesman also outlined his priorities for Anjouan once the island is stabilized, which included holding elections within three months, disarming Bacar's miltias, and putting Bacar on trial for corruption and human rights abuses once he is found.\nThe troops met some resistance from supporters of Mohamed Bacar, armed with assault rifles and rocket launchers and numbering around 400. Some loyalists gathered near Bacar's residence in Barakani, but the military soon took control of the area. The residence was searched, but Bacar was nowhere to be found.\nThe Bacar loyalists have reportedly begun using guerrilla tactics against the invading forces. \"I have over a hundred men and we will fight until we die,\" said Lieutenant Ibrahim Moussa of the loyalists. \"It's God's will that will decide who is to win and who is to die. The invaders won't make it through.\"\nThough one Comoros soldier reports that three of Bacar's highest-ranking supporters have been arrested, Bacar himself remains at large. The government spokesman says he has been seen fleeing to the island of Mayotte by canoe. \n\"Colonel Mohamed Bacar has been spotted in the village of Sadanpoini where he is heading without doubt for a place to flee on board a kwassa (small canoe) towards Mayotte Island,\" Abdourahim Said Bacar said. \"It seems, according to various sources, that he is dressed as a woman,\" he added.\nHowever, this information has not been confirmed. \"The Comoran command will not confirm any information regarding the arrest of Colonel Bacar,\" said reporter Franck Berruyer.\nIn a nationally televised address, Comoros president Ahmed Abdallah Mohamed Sambi said he had approved of the military operation. \"I have ordered the Comoran army and the forces of our country's friends to bring Anjouan back under the rule of law and free her citizens,\" he said.\nMeanwhile, South African president Thabo Mbeki denounced the operation. \"It takes Comoros back to the use of force to solve a problem that could have been resolved with negotiations,\" he said in a televised statement. \"There was no need to deploy troops.\""}

Ahola on representing Finland at Eurovision 2008 &amp; more", "text": "Ter\u00e4sbetoni means \"steel-reinforced concrete\", and is also the name of a Finnish heavy metal band formed in 2002. Their music, which centres on an honourable warrior lifestyle or on metal itself, quickly became popular in 2003 on the Internet, resulting in a petition by fans being sent to several record labels demanding a recording deal. In late 2004 the band signed to Warner Music Finland, and the following year debut single \"Taivas ly\u00f6 tulta\" rose to number one in the Finnish charts, and debut album \"Metallitotuus\" hit number two and went platinum, and has now sold about 47,000 copies.\nThe band, who sing exclusively in Finnish, have just released their third album, \"Myrskyntuoja\". The lead single on this album is \"Miss\u00e4 miehet ratsastaa\", which Ter\u00e4sbetoni decided to enter in the Finnish selections for the 2008 edition of the Eurovision Song Contest, where it was selected to go on to the semi-final in Belgrade, Serbia as Finland's representative this year. Although Finland has seen limited success in the contest, their only victory was with a comparable group. In 2006 hard rock band Lordi - whose monster costumes and pyrotechnic displays are famed - achieved a record 292 points in the final with \"Hard Rock Hallelujah\".\nTer\u00e4sbetoni's frontman, vocalist and bass guitarist Jarkko Ahola's fame extends beyond the band he heads. He also features in Finnish symphonic power metal cover supergroup Northern Kings, alongside Marco Hietala of Nightwish and Tarot, Tony Kakko of Sonata Arctica and Juha-Pekka Lepp\u00e4luoto of Charon. \nWikinews was able to conduct an exclusive interview with Jarkko Ahola to discuss these various achievements. This interview is now published below for the first time.\nInterview.\nOn the early days.\nDesite the fact that you focus on a lifestyle set in historic times, your band's name means \"steel-reinforced concrete\". Why did you choose that name?\nWe got together and had a little conversation about the name of our band. Pretty soon V. Rantanen suggested the name \u201cTer\u00e4sbetoni\u201d. We all thought it sounded great and it described our music well in a way that made people think \u201cwhat the hell is this?\u2026\u201d (And here you have to understand that word \u201cTer\u00e4sbetoni\u201d sounds and IS much cooler than \u201csteel-reinforced concrete\u201d.) I guess the name was okay, \u2018cause we didn\u2019t have a tendency or need to write songs about historic times, those kind of songs just came out. There are also songs that aren\u2019t set in the past, more into this day or this moment.\nHow did you come up with the concept for the band?\nMostly it just happened. We all must have had some kind of vision about the music and the looks for sure and we all agreed about the leather and skin. That\u2019s how it all began. We wrote songs we thought were good and metallish. We played them as metal should be played: loud\u2019n\u2019proud. There must have been something special about our music and live performances, \u2018cause the fan crowds just kept growing and growing. And while the band evolved, the concept evolved on its own.\nWhich artists would you say inspired you?\nWe all have our inspiration. I can\u2019t tell who have inspired other band members, but I\u2019ve always been inspired by the hard rock bands of the seventies: Deep Purple, Rainbow, Uriah Heep, Black Sabbath\u2026 you know, all the 70\u2019s classics. From the eighties bands like Dio, Manowar, Helloween, Accept have been on my CD- player. Nowadays I\u2019m inspired just by good music. No matter what kind of music it is, if it sounds great.\nDid the early reaction on the Internet surprise you?\nIt sure did. We knew we had something special on our hands, but there\u2019s always something special somewhere all the time, you know. We had this \u201cnot-so-pro\u201d-looking site with a picture of us and three demo songs\u2026and that was enough! All the basic pieces were so fit, that nothing else was needed. And of course there was also this \u201cAre these guys serious?\u201d-thing going on. It still is.\nWhen you made your debut releases you became an instant hit in Finland. What was that like for you at the time, and how is it now, still being a big success there?\nWell, you always tend to think that when you hit big, your life changes and everything is cool and crazy. But to us it really didn\u2019t change. After our first hit song \u201cTaivas Ly\u00f6 Tulta\u201d reigned the air, we were still playing in the small clubs with low prices. I guess many facets believed that we were just a fucking joke. It took some time for the gig organizers to realize that people wanted to see and hear us live. Anyway, it was all clear when we visited summer festivals and got huge audiences. Since then it has been pretty steady. \nNow with all this Eurovision stuff and publicity it\u2019s much more bigger than it was with our first hit and first album. Of course we aren\u2019t newbies to success and publicity now, so we take it causually. None of us really love being some kind of small celebs, but what we like is playing our music to our fans that never seem to let us down. It\u2019s great to meet them after gig and have few beers. So, if publicity is required for that, we\u2019ll accept it happily. \nSome people have described your music as \"corny\" or \"camp\". How do you respond to that? Would you agree with the view by some people that much of what you do is in fact a parody?\nLet\u2019s put it this way. If we would sing in English, that kind of thinking would be much less common. The problem seems to be the fact, that most of the people actually seem to understand our lyrics and they think that we can\u2019t be serious with this stuff. Hell, thousands of bands do the same thing in other language and nobody\u2019s laughing. Of course we have fun when play live or give interviews, but when we write new songs and record them, it\u2019s all real and true.\nOn Eurovision.\nWhat does it feel like to be selected to go to Eurovision, especially considering it is mostly an English language pop contest? Is that daunting at all?\nDaunting? No way. I\u2019m proud of being the representative of Finland. Finland has never done too well in Eurovision Song Contest, but Lordi gave the whole show a nice slap in the face. You know, it doesn\u2019t have to be pop to win the number one slot - you can actually play rock music there. We might seem a bit odd to European viewers, \u2018cause we have our leatherish looks, metallish music and we sing in Finnish. But in the end, I wish that people will like it.\nWhat is the song about?\nThe song is set in the Ter\u00e4sbetoni-world with certain lyrical style. So, there are horses, heroes and battlefields. But in the end the song is about harshness of life, the call of duty and responsibilty.\nHow do you expect Europe to react to a metal song in Finnish?\nWell, you can only guess. I believe they react like Finnish people do \u2013 they hate it or love it. Hopely most of them will love it.\nOf course, Finland has a history of similar Eurovision entries. Nightwish were second choice to represent Finland once with \"Sleepwalker\", and of course Lordi won the whole contest in 2006. What do you think of those entries?\nBoth of the bands have strong image and style. I\u2019m not too fond of their music, but you can\u2019t really deny their achievements.\nOf the entries so far, excluding yourself, who to win?\nI haven\u2019t heard any other entries yet. We\u2019ll check them out when we go to Serbia, \u2018cause we\u2019ll be there for two weeks. That\u2019s enough of full time Eurovision song focus.\nDo you reckon you have a chance of victory yourself?\nYou\u2019ll have to believe in your self if you go to a fight. This is also one of the themes of our ESC-song Miss\u00e4 Miehet Ratsastaa. \nA video for the Eurovision campaign planned to be shown to the press was deemed \"too burly\" for the contest. Was that anoying?\nYou mean our music video? I think the first version of the video was a bit heavy stuff for the people who don\u2019t us. But the new version doesn\u2019t really differ too much from the original, so in that perspective it was a bit annoying\u2026 or maybe better word is pointless. \nMany people reading this will be thinking about who to vote for at the contest. Why should they vote for you?\nBecause what we do is true and pure. We come as we are and play from our hearts. \nThat seems to be pretty rare in nowadays music, especially in pop genre where glamour and glitter seems to be essential. \u2026And our song is good, too!\nThe new album.\nHow has the reaction to your latest album been?\nWell, it reached the position number 1 in Finland\u2019s album chart. Most of our fans have thanked us for the best album so far. I\u2019ve seen few reviews and they weren\u2019t too flattering. On the other hand, they\u2019ve never been \u2018cause most of the reviews tend to discuss our looks, image and the lyrics. But it\u2019s all right, that kind of criticism have never affected to our listeners.\nWhat sort of things are the songs on this album about?\nWe are still fighting for metal music, so there are traditional songs about playing this music and calling all our brothers and sisters to get together. The other subjects vary from nightmares to galley slavery, from possession to burden of believing in your cause etc.\nTalk us through the writing process for the album.\nThis time we had much more time to write new songs than we did with our second album \u201cVaadimme Metallia\u201d. On the other hand the recording process\u2019 schedule was more shattered than it was with V.M. \nThe cycle of writing must be a bit different with each writer, but for example I might come up with an idea of a title of the song or just a guitar riff . From there I start to develop the song. Mostly it comes out pretty easy. Sometimes there\u2019s just a special mood that evolve to a song. When the rough version of song is in my mind, I record a demo of it. While recording I start hearing how the song should be sang and played. I also arrange the song in the demo phase. I make the demos ready &amp; polished and send them to band members, A&amp;R and producer. I believe A. J\u00e4rvinen and V. Rantanen, song writers as well, work pretty much the same way.\nAt this point we give each other comments and critcism about the songs we\u2019ve written. With the help of the producer and A &amp; R we choose the songs that should be recorded on the album. Of course the whole process is more complex but basically the it goes like that.\nDid all the recording, production etc go smoothly?\nYeah it did. Hiili Hiilesmaa, our producer, and the band knew each other already and we had discussions about the sound and direction of the new album. The working habits were familiar to us from the Vaadimme Metallia-sessions, so from that point of view things went smoothly. Our guitarists actually did some solos and backing vocals at home! I think that\u2019s a great example of relaxed way of producing.\nDo you plan a tour this year to support the album?\nWe\u2019re already gigging around Finland and summer tour is in the making . Visiting countries abroad would be great, too.\nNorthern Kings.\nHow did you come to be involved with Northern Kings?\nThe whole thing began with Raskasta Joulua \u2013tour that I was in. We also did an album called \u201cRaskaampaa Joulua\u201d. Anyway, there was some talk about doing something else together. You know, not just Christmas carrols in metal mode. Nobody really had the time to start writing new songs, so a cover album seemed to be a nice way of proceeding. \nEverybody agreed that the album should sound massive and orchestrated. At first we had no other direction than covering the music we liked. I did a demo of Procol Harum\u2019s \u201cSalty Dog\u201d with Erkka Korhonen. It was a good example of what we should sound like, but our record label\u2019s A &amp; R Osku Ketola thought that we should do something more defined. After few thoughts we decided to concentrate on pop hits of the 80\u2019s. That\u2019s how it all began. I had a chance to arrange my own atcs which was lots of fun. \nWhat's it like working with the other three established rockers?\nUnfortunately we didn\u2019t see each other while making the record. That may sound crazy, but that\u2019s how it goes nowadays. It\u2019s so easy to record your parts and send them to the studio for mixing. Happily, we saw each other while the photo &amp; video shoot. Marco Hietala, Tony Kakko and J-P Lepp\u00e4luoto are all great musicians and great persons. If we ever get to do any shows together, I\u2019m sure it would be wonderful in music and in brotherhood.\nIs it hard to divide your time between the projects?\nIt all depends on what you have going on already. While making Northern Kings album \u201cReborn\u201d Ter\u00e4sbetoni was having a break. I try to do things smoothly and avoid booking too much stuff on my calendar. You shouldn\u2019t be too greedy and accept all the stuff offered. \nOf course there are exceptions. For example while we were recording Myrskyntuoja, I had to leave studio early or not go there at all \u2018cause of promotional actions agreed by our record label. I can understand the meaning of promotion, but nothing sucks more than bothering an intensive studio session with another project. It screws up your focus. But fortunately that kind of shit is rare enough, so I don\u2019t care complaining about it. And the bottom line is that projects like Northern Kings bring great variety to your life as an artist. \nIs co-ordinating things with the other members hard when they've all got their projects, too?\nWell, luckily I didn\u2019t have to do that. That\u2019s producer\u2019s and A&amp;R\u2019s business. But what I\u2019ve seen from aside, it does seem a bit hard to fix up meetings, promo sessions etc. Somebody is always going somewhere!\nWhat do you think personally of the covers you've produced?\nI\u2019m very satisfied with the results. We all got to do arrangements and songs that looked like us. I\u2019ve heard few cover albums and they\u2019ve rarely been interesting. I think we managed to reach that point.\nWhat about the work of the others in their bands? Do you like their music as well?\nI give all the guys my sincere respect for their work. I think Marco Hietala\u2019s Tarot is one of the Finnish heavy metal legends and it still rocks. I\u2019m not so much into Nightwish, anyway. There\u2019s something that doesn\u2019t quite please my ears. Maybe I should listen to it more. Charon is good on its field and so is Sonata Arctica, while its style is not the style I prefer to listen in metal music. \nThe future and final words.\nExcept for an apearance at Germany's Wacken Open Air, you haven't done much international stuff prior to now. Might we see some gigs abroad in 2008, and if not when?\nAll I can say is I WISH! There might be few gigs in the summer, but we\u2019ll see. \nYou said \"Miss\u00e4 miehet ratsastaa\" wouldn't be translated into English simply because it was designed to work in Finnish. Does that mean we could see some songs written specially in English in the future?\nWith Ter\u00e4sbetoni I doubt it. We are pretty much focused on our own language. It would be pretty hard to see us singing in English and still be Ter\u00e4sbetoni, you know.\nWhat do you expect Eurovision to do for you? Have you seen any changes already?\nI hope we can get our music out as widely as possible. Even though it\u2019s just one song, I believe that it evokes interest in watchers and listeners. The local media has been interested in us since we won the finale, but nothing special hasn\u2019t yet happened.\nLoads of people in the music industry have been complaining that downloading illegaly is killing the industry. Do you agree?\nI believe it affects the industry and its sales. Still, it\u2019s hard to believe that it\u2019s killing the industry. Of course I also have rights that the illegal downloaders violate. So, even though it\u2019s not killing the industry, it\u2019s totally wrong. The whole system has to change somehow, that\u2019s for sure. \nWhat does it mean to you to be in these bands?\nIt means I can be who I am, a musician, a songwriter and an artist. I\u2019ve done other stuff in my life and I can tell you there were times when I thought that life just sucked. I am grateful for being in this position.\nAny final words for any of your fans reading this?\nAll that ever comes to my mind is THANK YOU. You really are the air I breathe. Please, keep on giving it to me. I\u2019ll keep on giving you music."}

Reports indicate that at least sixty people have been killed and hundreds have been wounded. This marked the second day of intense fighting.\nCombat is reported to have spread to other southern cities and also to Bagdhad. \"Agence France-Presse\" reported that two United States soldiers were killed in the capital city.\nPrime Minister Nouri al-Maliki has been in Basra since Monday to personally supervise \"Operation Sulat al-Fursan\" (\"Knights Charge\") which the authorities described as designed to reimpose law and order. Today, he gave an ultimatum to the militants, giving them 72 hours to surrender. \"Otherwise, they will face the most severe penalties,\" Maliki said in a televised statement.\nObservers see the Basra operation as a test of the Iraqi government's ability to assert its control over a region that is not administered by foreign military forces. United Kingdom forces patrolled Basra from the onset of the invasion until they turned it over to Iraqi authorities in December of 2007.\nUS spokesperson Major-General Kevin Bergner said that, \"These are Iraqi decisions, they are Iraqi government forces and these are Iraqi leaders implementing and directing these decisions.\" He added that a year ago, the ISF would not have been able to conduct an operation of this scale.\nAnthony Cordesman, a security analyst at the Center for Strategic and International Studies told \"Bloomberg\" via e-mail: \"The current fighting is as much a power struggle for control of the south and the Shiite parts of Baghdad\" as it is an attempt to establish government authority. The Supreme Islamic Iraqi Council is \"clearly positioning itself for a power struggle with Sadr and for any elections to come,\" Cordesman added.\nBergner further said that the fighting in Basra is neither a battle against the Mahdi Army, nor is it a proxy war against Iran. Rather it is \"to deal with criminals in the streets with weapons,\" he said. \"We [the US] shall continue to show restraint on those who have undertaken Muqtada al-Sadr's pledge.\" A 2006 US report, however, called al-Sadr's Mahdi Army a \"most dangerous accelerant of potentially self-sustaining sectarian violence in Iraq.\"\nAides of Muqtada al-Sadr say that the cleric's cease-fire, which was declared in August 2007, is still in force. On Tuesday, al-Sadr called for a non-violent \"civil revolt\" and supporters have been protesting the Maliki government forcing schools and shops to close.\n\"There are ongoing negotiations with the prime minister. Maliki asked to meet Sadr officials in Basra,\" Harith al-Ithari, head of al-Sadr's Basra office, told \"Reuters\".\nMuqtada al-Sadr was seen as instrumental in Maliki's rise to power, but al-Sadr broke from Maliki in 2005. According to Iraqi political analyst Hazem al-Nuaeimi, Sadr is a thorn in the side of other Shia groups that currently support Maliki. \"There is a need to minimize the Sadrists' strength and influence and to draw the lines before they get any stronger,\" he said.\n\"We have been living for the last hours in hell. We have spent most of the time hiding under the staircase,\" said Faris Hayder, a 28-year-old resident of Basra to \"Reuters\". \"We haven't seen anything like this since the foreign troops arrived in 2003.\"\n\"No one wants to see a return to the violence of a year ago,\" Bergner said Wednesday on television from Baghdad. \"This has been a difficult and challenging few days, it's also been a period of significant effort for the Iraqi security forces.\" "}

While the Pentagon stated that Taiwan only alerted the U.S. of the error recently, a spokesperson for the Taiwanese military argued that the United States military was notified by Taiwanese officials immediately after the delivery of the fuses. The U.S. responded by saying it was informed of the mistake, but was not told that Taiwan received the nose cone fuses and was therefore not aware of the full extent of the situation.\nChina has issued a statement in response to the incident, criticizing the U.S. for its negligence and demanding for the cessation of arms sales to Taiwan.\nThe accidentally-delivered nose cone fuses are designed to be employed in the LGM-30 Minuteman, an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of carrying a nuclear warhead."}

Linnehan, Takao Doi and Expedition 16 crewmember L\u00e9opold Eyharts. The landing was waved off on the first attempt due to overcast skies at the landing site. This resulted in a 90 minute delay to landing.\nMain gear touchdown occurred at 00:39:08 GMT, followed nine seconds later by nose gear touchdown. Wheels-stop occurred at 00:40:41.\nThis mission was the 21st for \"Endeavour\", the 122nd Space Shuttle mission, and the 25th and longest Shuttle mission to the ISS. The next Shuttle mission is STS-124, which will be flown by \"Discovery\". This is currently scheduled to launch in late May. Before this, Soyuz TMA-12 will be launched, in early April, with the Space Station's Expedition 17 crew, and Yi So-yeon, who will become the first South Korean in space. Endeavour's next mission, STS-126, is planned for October."}

Full-length episodes from the past 12 seasons of \"South Park\" can be seen on the site, as well as behind-the-scenes clips and information on upcoming episodes. \nAfter new episodes of the program air on Comedy Central they will be added to the site for one week, but will then be unavailable for the next 30 days before being added to the site's archives, due to contractual obligations. SouthParkStudios.com was relaunched with free streaming episodes on March 19, and as of Comedy Central's announcement Tuesday the site had three million hits, two million video plays and one million full-episode streams. 168 of the series' 169 episodes are currently available on the site. \nThe site is currently in a beta format and is ad supported, but visitors can watch an unlimited number of episodes. Streaming episodes are uncensored, and each episode will have between three and four advertisements. The website also has news, games, blogs and a feature where users can create \"South Park\" avatar characters in their likeness. Fans can also choose from 3,000 episode clips from the show to embed on their blogs or websites. The website was created by WPP agency Schematic, with Toyota and Virgin as launch sponsors. \nSouthParkStudios.com launched this past summer with games and other media content, in a deal between \"South Park\" creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker where their contract with Comedy Central was extended for three years and the cable television channel agreed to split online ad revenue 50-50. Matt Stone commented on the three-year contract to produce more episodes of the series: \"Three more years of South Park will give us the opportunity to offend that many more people ... And since Trey and I are in charge of the digital side of South Park, we can offend people on their cellphones, game consoles, and computers too. It's all very exciting for us.\"\nParker and Stone released a statement about the website: \"We got really sick of having to download our own show illegally all the time, so we gave ourselves a legal alternative.\" Parker and Stone don't think that the move will affect DVD sales of past seasons, because fans will still want to own episodes in a \"hard copy\" format.\nThe website is managed by South Park Digital Studios LLC, a joint venture of Parker and Stone and Comedy Central. Anne Garefino, general manager of South Park Digital Studios stated: \"One goal in moving forward is to make every episode of South Park available worldwide ... Currently, full episodes are not available in the U.K., Australia and a few other foreign territories, but we're not far off from making that happen. We have some contractual issues to sift through but we're getting there.\"\nOn the move to make the episodes available for free, Sam Thielman of \"Variety\" wrote: \"It's a good time for Parker and Stone to distance themselves from the YouTube community given Comedy Central parent Viacom's protracted lawsuit against the Web-based video distrib, which features clips from the show.\" Viacom is suing YouTube for US$1 billion in damages relating to video clips displayed on the video-sharing website. Richard Menta of \"MP3 Newswire\" wrote: \"With all their content already out there Stone, Parker and Viacom realized offering South Park episodes online directly is a low risk proposition. They might as well draw some ad revenue from it.\""}

Puerto Rico is a semi-autonomous territory of the United States.\nIndicted along with Acevedo Vil\u00e1 are 12 other people associated with his Popular Democratic Party, all living in Puerto Rico, Washington D.C., or Philadelphia. In total, there were 27 charges.\nThe U.S. Attorney Rosa Emilia Rodr\u00edguez of the District of Puerto Rico said that, because of the nature of the crimes he is charged with, the Governor himself will not be arrested immediately and will be given a chance to \"give himself up to the police.\" Some of the other people charged, however, have already been arrested and await trial.\nThe 13 defendants are charged with conspiracy, false statements, wire fraud, federal program fraud and tax crimes related to the financing for the Governor's 1999-2002 campaigns for Resident Commissioner, the sole representative of the island in the U.S. Congress, and for his subsequent 2004 gubernatorial run.\nThis indictment comes after a two-year investigation by a Grand Jury of donations made to the Governor's past campaigns. \nThe defendants face three to ten years in federal prison, as well as several $100,000 to $250,000 fines.\nAcevedo Vil\u00e1's lawyer Thomas Green says he will defend the Governor \"vigorously\", and that he finds it troubling that these accusations come only months before the General Elections in Puerto Rico, in which the Governor will run for a second term.\nGovernor Acevedo Vil\u00e1 made a televised statement at 5:30 p.m. local time (22:30 UTC) in which he defended himself from the accusations and indicated he will continue in his post. \nGovernor Acevedo Vil\u00e1 is the chairman of the Popular Democratic Party of Puerto Rico, which supports the island's current Commonwealth status with the United States, instead of full statehood or independence."}

Bush, today discussed the \"global war on terror,\" at the National Museum of the United States Air Force. In the speech Mr. Bush discussed the surge in Iraq. He said, \"Over the past year, we [the US government] have seen significant security gains result from the surge.\"\nBush also claimed that the United States had achieved many things in Iraq. He stated that \"the military achievements in Iraq have been accompanied by a political transformation. It can feel like distant history, but it was only five years ago that Iraq was one of the most brutal dictatorships on Earth - a totalitarian nightmare where any election was a sham, and dissenters often found themselves buried in mass graves. In a matter of 15 months, the Iraqi people reclaimed their sovereignty. They went on to choose an interim government, and to ratify the most democratic constitution in the Arab world. And in December 2005, 12 million Iraqis elected a government under that constitution - a display of courage that defied the terrorists, disproved the critics, and should always inspire the world.\"\nHe continued, saying that, \"Tragically, the [democratic] progress [in Iraq] threatened to unravel in 2006. The new government Iraqis elected took months to form. In the meantime, a terrorist attack on a Shia shrine in Samarra drove sectarian tensions past the breaking point. Sunni extremists, including al Qaeda terrorists, and Shia extremists, some backed by Iran, slaughtered innocent Iraqis in brutal attacks and reprisal killings. And across the country, political and economic activity was set back.\"\nPresident Bush did, however, say that the US coped well with the situation in Iraq. \"We took a hard look at the situation, and responded with the surge. This dramatic shift in policy had two primary goals. The first was to improve security conditions. So I ordered 30,000 additional soldiers and Marines into Iraq, and gave them a new mission, to focus on protecting the Iraqi people, and to hold the gains that had been made,\" he said."}

Next year's fuel bill is going up by \u20ac400m. We only have around 10% hedged in the high $70s for next year and I wouldn't be hedging now. We'll take our chances in the markets,\" explained O'Leary.\nUBS analyst Tim Marshall estimates Ryanair's fuel bill is set to increase \u20ac732m this financial year to \u20ac1.01bn. UBS predicts a profit of \u20ac485m for this year, but O'Leary says profits could be down to \u20ac235m between now and March 2009, dependent on \"oil prices and average fares\". In light of the news, shares in Ryanair fell 2\u00be cents to \u20ac2.96\u00bd each.\nRyanair is trying hard to reduce costs, O'Leary saying they were \"renegotiating airport contracts, handling contracts, maintenance contracts. We [Ryanair] want to reduce costs in every area of our operation.\" He said prices for passengers are set to go up, as \"bag charges will keep going up until we can persuade half of our passengers to travel without checked-in luggage so we can get our handling charges down\". At present, around 40% do this.\nHe said that to fill an extra 30% of seats the airline will keep fares relatively low. \"We won't have to cut the fares like hell but they are not going to go up... More will fly with Ryanair than British Airways, Air France and all the other high-priced airlines.\"\nSources.\n "}
