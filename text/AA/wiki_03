Protesters hope to collect a petition of 1.2 million signatures to present to the National Congress in November.\nPeople carrying flags and banners, some dressed in lavish carnival costumes, walked and danced in the ninth annual Gay Pride parade, stretching for 3.5 kilometres along Avenida Paulista. Traffic was diverted throughout most of the city, and drinks and snacks vendors took advantage of the barriers across many streets. Prominent people joining the parade were the actor Sergio Mamberti, representing the Culture Minister Gilberto Gil, and senator Eduardo Suplicy.\nOrganizers stated that 2.5 million people attended, and police stated that there were 1.9 million \u2014 figures which would make the event the largest of its kind in the world \u2014 including 700,000 visitors from other cities and countries.

His nomination was immediately criticized by left-wing politicians, as well as by the center-right Union for French Democracy, a junior partner in the ruling coalition, as a continuation of the same failed policies; Mr. Villepin was himself criticized as being out-of-touch with respect of the daily needs of the population. The Union for a Popular Movement, the party created for backing Chirac, has now rallied behind Nicolas Sarkozy, whose reciprocal distaste for Chirac and Villepin is well-published.\nJacques Chirac announced that Nicolas Sarkozy would be Minister of State (a honorific rank) in the government; it is yet unknown what his attributions will be, but it is rumored that he will become Minister of the Interior, a position whose main function is law enforcement and which he also held from 2002 to 2004.

The fact that it made \u20ac248m on turnover of just \u20ac1.34bn makes it by some margin the world's most profitable major airline. One of the key methods of keeping costs to a minimum at Ryanair is by using less staff to carry more passengers, in comparison to its main competitors:\nRyanair has a stated aim of raising its passenger numbers to above 70m within five years time, making it Europe's largest airline.

The verdict virtually put Andersen, once one of the largest accounting firms in the world and the fifth-largest in the United States, out of business.\nIn a unanimous opinion written by Chief Justice William Rehnquist, the court threw out the verdict due to serious flaws in the jury instructions. The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals had upheld Andersen's June 15, 2002 conviction in Houston. \nIn the court's view, the instructions allowed the jury to convict Andersen without proving that the firm knew it broke the law or that there was a link to any official proceeding that prohibited the destruction of documents. \"The jury instructions at issue simply failed to convey the requisite consciousness of wrongdoing,\" Rehnquist wrote. \"Indeed, it is striking how little culpability the instructions required.\" Rehnquist's opinion also expressed grave skepticism at the government's definition of \"corrupt persuasion\"--persuasion with an improper purpose even without knowing an act is unlawful. \"Only persons conscious of wrongdoing can be said to 'knowingly corruptly persuade,' \" he wrote. \nThe ruling came very quickly, as oral arguments in the case had taken place on April 27. Justice Department attorneys claimed Andersen employees were instructed \"undertake an unprecedented campaign of document destruction\" in order to impede a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation into Enron's conduct. Deputy Solicitor General David Dreeben likened Andersen's behavior to \"shredding its smoking guns.\"\nHowever, Maureen Mahoney, arguing for Andersen, countered that the employees involved merely followed the company's policy on destroying unneeded documents, and that the shredding occurred before Andersen received a subpoena on November 8, 2001. She also claimed that under the government's legal definition of \"corrupt persuasion,\" acquittal was virtually impossible.\nThe justices seemed to indicate which way they were leaning very early in oral arguments, as they peppered the government lawyers with hostile remarks. \nJustice Antonin Scalia called the government's theory of prosecution \"weird.\" Justice Sandra Day O'Connor was particularly troubled by the trouble the jury initially had sifting the evidence. \"If this thing is so confusing,\" she asked, \"how is a businessperson supposed to know? How is a lawyer supposed to know?\"\nAndersen's appeal was backed by the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers. In a friend-of-the-court brief, the association claimed that the government's broad definition of \"corrupt persuasion\" put defense lawyers at risk for prosecution simply for advising clients of their rights to assert legal privileges or review document retention policies.\nDespite the ruling, which returns the case to the Fifth Circuit, it is highly unlikely Andersen will ever return as a viable business. It lost nearly all of its clients after its indictment, and was forced to shut down its American accounting practice due to federal laws that forbid convicted felons from auditing public companies. The firm still faces more than 100 civil suits related to its audits of Enron and other companies. Once 28,000 employees strong, the Chicago-based Andersen is now down to around 200 employees who are largely occupied with handling the civil suits and other details of winding down the partnership."}

There is no allegation of any criminal act. This is a disciplinary action for a breach of staff rules regarding procurement.\"\nThe investigation concluded that Stephanides infringed on regulations by helping the British company, Lloyds Register Inspection Ltd., win a contract under the UN programme for Iraq. Mr. Stephanides acted as the head of the Security Council Affairs Division when he allegedly told the company how much to lower its price to be awarded a contract. He denies any wrong-doing and hired a lawyer to defend himself. Aged 59, Stephanides worked for the UN for 25 years, and was due to retire in September this year.\nAfter a first food-for-oil interim report was released in February, Mr. Stephanides along with Benon Sevan were suspended. Sevan, the former head of the oil-for-food programme for 6 years, was also accused of breach of procurement rules in the report co-written by Paul Volcker. However, disciplinary measures against Sevan will not be carried out because of his status of diplomatic immunity.\nA final report is scheduled for publication in three months which should further clarify whether Mr. Sevan received Iraqi oil allocations for a friend's company. In the meantime, he remains suspended from all UN duties, and is being given only a symbolic salary of one dollar a year.\nA central and unanswered question, is whether either Stephanides or Sevan profited directly by their actions in executing and implementing the complex programme."}

The Downing Street Memo is a leaked secret British document that details the minutes of a 2002 meeting between top-level British and American government officials. The memo states that George W. Bush \"was determined\" to attack Iraq long before going to Congress with the matter, and that \"the intelligence and facts were being fixed around the policy.\" The accuracy of the memo is not being disputed by either government. The memo caused an uproar in Great Britain and made a significant impact in the British national elections, but has gotten little attention in American news. Kerry said of the memo: \n\"When I go back [to Washington] on Monday, I am going to raise the issue. I think it's a stunning, unbelievably simple and understandable statement of the truth and a profoundly important document that raises stunning issues here at home. And it's amazing to me the way it escaped major media discussion. It's not being missed on the Internet, I can tell you that.\"\nHe questioned Americans' understanding of the war and the idea that criticism equals disloyalty, saying,\n\"Do you think that Americans if they really understood it would feel that way knowing that on Election Day, 77 percent of Americans who voted for Bush believed that weapons of mass destruction had been found and 77 percent believe Saddam did 9/11? Is there a way for this to break through, ever?\"\nRepresentative John Conyers has written to the President regarding the memo:\n\"...a debate has raged in the United States over the last year and one half about whether the obviously flawed intelligence that falsely stated that Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction was a mere 'failure' or the result of intentional manipulation to reach foreordained conclusions supporting the case for war. The memo appears to close the case on that issue stating that in the United States the intelligence and facts were being 'fixed' around the decision to go to war.\"\nThere is a growing movement on the internet and in Congress for a \"Resolution of Inquiry\" into issues surrounding the planning and execution of the Iraq war, especially in regard to the Administration's handling of intelligence. John Dean, a key Watergate figure, wrote in a June 2003 column for findlaw.com, that, \"To put it bluntly, if Bush has taken Congress and the nation into war based on bogus information, he is cooked... Manipulation or deliberate misuse of national security intelligence data, if proven, could be a 'high crime' under the Constitution's impeachment clause.\"\nHowever, in practical terms impeachment in the U.S. Senate requires a 2/3 majority for conviction, which is unlikely given that 55 out of 100 Senators are Republican.\nWhen asked about the Downing Street Memo on May 23, White House spokesman Scott McClellan said:\n\"If anyone wants to know how the intelligence was used by the administration, all they have to do is go back and look at all the public comments over the course of the lead-up to the war in Iraq, and that's all very public information. Everybody who was there could see how we used that intelligence.\n\"And in terms of the intelligence, it was wrong, and we are taking steps to correct that and make sure that in the future we have the best possible intelligence, because it's critical in this post-September 11th age, that the executive branch has the best intelligence possible.\""}

The IRC has said it reported to the U.S. government detainee's reports of desecration of the Qur'an. In the foreword of the report, written by Amnesty International Secretary General , Guantanamo was compared to a Soviet-era gulag in that it is \"entrenching the practice of arbitrary and indefinite detention in violation of international law\".\nWhite House spokesman Scott McClellan responded saying the report's allegations were \"ridiculous and unsupported by the facts.

Schulz, executive director of Amnesty International USA, defended the report, saying, \"What is 'absurd' is President Bush's attempt to deny the deliberate policies of his administration.\" and \"What is 'absurd' and indeed outrageous is the Bush administration's failure to undertake a full independent investigation\".

One incident involved splashing a Koran with urine by urinating near an air vent while others involved kicking, stepping on and writing in Qur'ans.\n, the commander of the jail, looked into the allegations, published and then retracted by Newsweek, that American personnel flushed a Qur'an down a toilet. He said that the inquiry did not find any evidence supporting this particular allegation. \"The inquiry found no credible evidence that a member of the Joint Task Force at Guantanamo Bay ever flushed a Qur'an down a toilet.

At the 11th minute mark, Robbie Keane scored Ireland's second goal of the match; much to the delight - and even moreso relief of the Irish supporters in the crowd of 34,000.\nIn a seemingly comfortable position, disaster hit the Irish team when Robbie Keane left for the bench with a shoulder injury sustained in the third minute of the game. As the 40th minute approached, Israel's Benayoun and Avi Yehiel combined efforts to put the ball in the back of the Irish net to bring their team back into the game. Things went from bad to worse for the Irish as the first half drew to a close with John O'Shea getting a yellow card in the Irish box - and giving his opposition a penalty. The penalty was scored three time by Nimni, but only on his third attempt did it count - the first two disallowed because the referee had not blown his whistle.\nThe second half proved to be less fruitious for both teams, with no goals scored. The Irish became increasingly frustrated as the game progressed because of perceived Israeli time-wasting. As the game became more scrappy Andy O'Brien got sent off when he attempted to block the Israeli keeper from punching the ball.\nThe game finished 2-2, much to the despair of the Irish squad, who now can only draw encouragement from the fact that they remain ahead of France in the group table."}

Engineers worked for nearly five weeks to carefully maneuver the rover out of the sand dune.\n\"After a nerve-wracking month of hard work, the rover team is both elated and relieved to finally see our wheels sitting on top of the sand instead of half buried in it,\" said Jeffrey Biesiadecki, a JPL rover mobility engineer.\nTraction was difficult in the ripple-shaped dune of windblown dust and sand that Opportunity drove into on April 26. In the weeks following, the rover churned 192 meters (629 feet) worth of wheel rotations before gaining enough traction to actually move one meter (about three feet). The rover team directed the drives in cautious increments from May 13 through June 4.\n\"We did careful testing for how to get Opportunity out of the sand. Then we patiently followed the strategy developed from the testing, monitoring every step of the way,\" Biesiadecki said. \"We hope to have Opportunity busy with a full schedule of scientific exploration again shortly.\"\nOpportunity's next task is to examine the site to provide a better understanding of what makes that ripple different from the dozens of similar ones the rover easily crossed. \"After we analyze this area, we'll be able to plan safer driving in the terrain ahead,\" said JPL's Jim Erickson, rover project manager.\nBoth Spirit and Opportunity have worked in harsh Martian conditions much longer than anticipated. They have been studying geology on opposite sides of Mars for more than a year of extended missions since successfully completing their three-month primary missions in April 2004.\n\"The first thing we're going to do is simply take a hard look at the stuff we were stuck in,\" said Dr. Steve Squyres of Cornell University, Ithaca, N.Y. He is the principal investigator for the Mars rovers' science instruments. \"After that, we will begin a cautious set of moves to get us on our way southward again. South is where we think the best science is, so that's still where we want to go.\"\nShortly after landing in January 2004, Opportunity found layered bedrock that bore geological evidence for a shallow ancient sea. Spirit did not find extensive layered bedrock until more than a year later, after driving more than two miles and climbing into a range of hills known as \"Columbia Hills.\""}

The Canadian transport minister Jean Lapierre said two-thirds of Canada's domestic flights at some point cross through American air space. The Minister said he may have to re-route them (around U.S. airspace) rather than breach the privacy rights of domestic Canadian passengers.\nIn plans which are not yet finalized, Washington recently warned Canada (and other countries) the U.S. intends to require that its no-fly list procedures apply to all foreign airlines which pass through U.S. airspace. After 9/11, a watch list of suspected terrorists was created by the U.S. that bars those on the list from air travel within its borders.\nOn Wednesday, Lapierre said it's a \u201cvery hot issue,\u201d and that he\u2019s working to protect the privacy of Canadians.\n\u201cI\u2019m very worried about it. We don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea that Canadians travelling from one (Canadian) city to another would have to be checked under the American no-fly list.\u201d Lapierre said. He estimates that nearly two-thirds of the 278,000 yearly flights between Canadian cities cross over the U.S. border. Most major flight zones from urban centers in Canada are in its southern portion, close to the U.S. where even winds might push a plane across the border.\nIf the matter can not be resolved, Lapierre said, \u201cWe would have to take a northern route, which would be much more expensive.\u201d \"Yahoo! News Canada\" reports that Lapierre intends to lobby U.S. Transportation Secretary Norman Mineta against the changes.\nLast year, the Canadian province of British Columbia put controls on firms that handle an individual's personal data that prevents them from sharing private information on Canadians with U.S. authorities. The issue goes to Canada's sovereignty of its citizens and the U.S. sovereignty of its airspace.\nThe historically close relations between Canada and the U.S. was evident during the recent Virgin Atlantic incident, where a flight was intercepted by 2 Canadian CF-18 jet fighters. They were scrambled from Quebec to escort the inter-continental flight originating from London to the Halifax International Airport after a hijacking signal, an apparent accident, was sent from the plane. The plane was detained in Halifax on Friday for approximately four hours. Ultimately it was cleared, and landed safely at its original destination in John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York City.\nBoth the ACLU and the are involved in lawsuits against the U.S. government relating to no-fly lists. EPIC has received documents under the U.S. Freedom of Information Act which it says \"establish that the TSA administers two lists: a \"no-fly\" list and a \"selectee\" list, which requires the passenger to go through additional security measures. The names are provided to air carriers through Security Directives or Emergency Amendments and are stored in their computer systems so that an individual with a name that matches the list can be flagged when getting a boarding pass. A \"no-fly\" match requires the agent to call a law enforcement officer to detain and question the passenger. In the case of a Selectee, an \"S\" or special mark is printed on their boarding pass and the person receives additional screening at security.\" "}

Schulz had previously referred to \"apparent high-level architects of torture,\", and included Donald Rumsfeld in that group. \nDirector Schulz stated that comparing the installation to a gulag was perhaps not the best choice of words. \"...they (detainees) are not in forced labor, they are not being denied food. But,\" he continued,\" there are some analogies between the gulags and our detention facilities.\" Schulz alleged that U.S. officials are \"running an archipelago of detention facilities,\" some secret. The report also describes \"ghost\" detainees who \"disappear\" and the export of prisoners to countries that are known to practice torture.\nDuring his appearance, Schulz argued that his and other human rights groups should be given broader access to the facility. \"We don't know for sure what all is happening at Guantanamo,\" he said, \"and our whole point is that the United States ought to allow independent human rights organizations to investigate.\" The treatment of prisoners at the facility has been in hot dispute recently, with Amnesty International comparing the facility to a \"gulag\" in its annual human rights report. Bush administration officials condemned the comparison. \nOn Friday, the U.S. government released documents indicating that both guards and detainees at the facility had on a few occasions abused the Qur'an, the Muslim holy book.\nPrisoners and ex-prisoners at Guantanamo Bay have testified that they have been tortured. David Hicks, still being held, filed an affidavit on August 5, 2004 declaring that he had been tortured, abused and ill-treated during his detention by US military authorities, and that he saw and heard similar treatment inflicted on other detainees. Mamdouh Habib, now free, says about his time at Guantanamo Bay that he was told by interrogators that his family had been killed, and that he was tied to the ground while a prostitute menstruated on him. Professor Christopher Tennant of Sydney University also stated he saw an unsigned medical report from Guantanamo Bay that backed up Habib's claim to have been beaten while in US custody; \n\"Well, the main feature of the medical report from Guantanamo was that he had had repeatedly blood in his urine, which is a very significant symptom and a worrying symptom, and that was consistent with his reports both to me and to the specialist physician who also examined him, and was consistent with the fact that, on examination, he had evidence of discolouration to his skin on his right loin, just over his kidney, which in turn was consistent with old bruising and possibly due to being beaten.\""}

Deputy Jefferson is the President of the Brazilian Labour Party (PTB) and he is accused of directing a corrupt scheme that involves the Brazilian postal service. The PTB is an ally of the government.\nJefferson's allegations increase the severe political crisis regarding the government of Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva. Lula has convened a special meeting to discuss the crisis in the government. Because of the recent scandal Brazilian stock markets went down and the U.S. Dollar increased its value in relation to the Brazilian Real.\nThe Brazilian Senate and the Chamber of Deputies are discussing the installation of a special congressional commission to investigate the allegations. The first attempt of the Brazilian government to prevent the creation of the Congress' special commission (convincing some deputies not to endorse the commission's creation) has failed. Now the government is trying to stop the creation of the commission in the Senate and is lobbying against it in the Congress, trying to influence both senators and deputies.\nThe opposition party, PSDB, criticized recently the efforts of the Brazilian government to stop the special commission of investigation, using the influence of the Minister of the Economy Antonio Palocci.\nThe Workers\u2019 Party published in its webpage a note denying Jefferson\u2019s allegations and saying that it supports investigations by Brazilian authorities. The Brazilian Minister Waldir Pires has said in an interview with Agencia Brasil that the denunciations of corruption are appearing more because the government is fighting against them. He also blamed previous governments by the corruption.\nIn a note in the Workers\u2019 Party website, the party accuses the former-President Fernando Henrique Cardoso government of corruption.\nOn April 2005, the Mayor of Rio de Janeiro, Cesar Maia, denounced the Workers\u2019 Party payment to deputies.\nThe allegations of Jefferson marks the beginnings of a severe crisis in Brazilian government. This is the most severe crisis since the impeachment of the former President Fernando Collor de Mello in 1992.\nPoliticians from the opposition said that they don't want the impeachment of Lula, however they demand the investigation of all denunciations and that the guilty be punished.\nSources.\nAudio.\nSome excerpts of the interview of Roberto Jefferson:"}

Representatives from the City of Santa Ana, the Santa Ana Unified School District, and the South Coast Air Quality Management District (AQMD) were available to answer the community's questions.\nSenator Dunn started off the meeting by thanking the panelists and parents for showing their support by attending. \"We are trying to address a very, very important issue. What's the issue? We have high rates of cancer, leukemia, and respiratory problems in our children. Why are our kids sick? This is a very difficult question,\" he said. \"What's causing the sickness in our children, and how can we avoid it? We can all agree that \"no one\" wants to see another sick child in Santa Ana.\" The audience applauded. \"Three weeks ago, we heard from two parents and a teacher, they told us about some deaths.\"\nThe previous town hall meeting was held to address concerns of the community about a steel plating manufacturing plant that applied to the AQMD for a permit to expand its facilities to increase pollution emissions. Parents and teachers were concerned over the facts that the plant was located directly adjacent to Kennedy Elementary School, and that their children were experiencing high levels of lead, respiratory problems, excessive nose-bleeding, and leukemia.\n\"How many businesses in Santa Ana are required to obtain permits for [emissions] of hazardous pollutants?\" This question Dunn posed at the last meeting was answered by the AQMD and the Orange County Sanitation District, who provided maps of Santa Ana with green flags indicating where businesses with emissions permits were located. \"I can tell you one thing, at the end of the meeting, we won't have all of the answers... but we'll certainly have another Town Hall meeting.\nInitial concerns were raised when five boys attending Franklin Elementary were diagnosed with the same type of leukemia in Spring 2002. Attempts to gain an investigation from the Center for Disease Control (CDC) into possible causes were not successful as the Center told parents that the cases \"were in an acceptable range\". Parents, teachers, public officials, and doctors remain unconvinced. In the past three years, 19 mothers living in an apartment building a block away from Franklin were also diagnosed with leukemia.\nDunn then introduced a teacher at Franklin, Tammy Sanchez. Tammy said, \"In December 2002, we received some very disturbing news. One of my students was diagnosed with leukemia. Then, more children at Franklin were diagnosed with leukemia. I later found out that three kids at a nearby apartment building were diagnosed with leukemia. Sanchez then explained about more cancer-related deaths near Franklin, including 19 mothers all living in he same apartment building who were diagnosed with leukemia, which took over three minutes. \"To me, this is way too much,\" said Sanchez.\nSocorro Molina, whose son Diego, a student at Franklin, is undergoing treatment for his leukemia, had this to say: \"My son has leukemia. I'm worried, because there are many kids. Children who played with my son died from leukemia. They should do some investigations of these companies.\" Senator Dunn responded, \"Thank you, Socorro. I know it's difficult to share that privately, and you have shared this with us publicly on two occasions.\"\nSenator Dunn then said, \"at the end of that [previous] meeting, we were requested by a parent for a map of all businesses releasing toxic materials. We asked the AQMD for a map that showed every single business [in Santa Ana] that releases harmful materials into our air. This is that map. The heaviest concentration of these businesses are, guess where? Near Franklin. This map is \"striking\". The OCSD gave us a map showing all businesses that release toxic materials into our sewers. The largest concentration of these businesses are, guess where? Near Franklin and Kennedy [Elementary Schools].\" Senator Dunn promised that at the next town hall meeting, he will have a panel of scientists present to determine if the substances released by these business pose a health risk to residents of the area. \"We are going to keep at this until we find out what is making our kids sick,\" he said.\nSanta Ana City Council member Jose Solorio said that \"the city has been following the media's attention. I got to tell you, this is a very complex issue. The city has jurisdiction over land use; they can issue restrictions. We, as elected officials, need to know more.\" Solorio then introduced the city's planning director and other city officials. Solorio added, \"the mayor of Santa Ana, Miguel Pulido, is a board-member for AQMD.\" Miguel Pulido has not attended any of the town hall meetings, and has not spoken about this issue at any time.\nDunn then introduced the next panelist, Santa Ana Unified School District board member Rosemary Avila. She said, \"the school board is looking into this. I've talked to some teachers on the phone I believe the federal disease organization has been contacted about this.\" The Center for Disease Control was notified by parents of the leukemia cases in Santa Ana, but stated that they were \"within the acceptable range\". Avila then introduced some school board officials, and said, \"there has been some concern in the past, and we have looked into that. As a school district, we really have to act not out of fear, but with facts.\"\nJill Whynot of the AQMD noted that \"there are 515 facilities [in Santa Ana] that we issue permits to\". Barry Wallerstein, Executive Officer of the AQMD said, \"we appreciate the forum. There appears to be a need for closer air quality monitoring. So, I propose that we make Santa Ana a high priority and closely monitor air quality in your community.\" That statement was met with much applause from the audience.\nSenator Dunn responded, \"we thank the AQMD for being here and answering our questions. We will be sure to let everybody know about any updates. When I looked at the map, I was struck. There are 515 permitted businesses in Santa Ana. We will bring some scientists in at the next town hall meeting to determine which businesses are releasing carcinogenic pollutants,\" he said. \"When I look at the maps, there are two pockets of permitted facilities in Santa Ana. Do you [AQMD] look at the cumulative impact of facilities grouped together [when considering issuing a permit]?\" Dunn posed.\nDr. Wallerstein responded, \"the short answer is 'partially'\".\nSenator Dunn, responding to Dr. Wallerstein's comments, said \"if we need to give AQMD more power in terms of cumulative impact of permitted facilities, then we will introduce legislation to give them that power.\" The Senator then asked City Councilman Solorio, \"does the city in any way look at what type of business it is, or its cumulative impact [when approving a business]?\"\nSolorio responded, \"one of the main things the city does is make a General Plan, and unlike Irvine or Newport Beach, we are an older city.\" Solorio went on to talk about how in the future, the city could pass litigation limit permits, and said that \"we all need to do our part\". Referring to concerns about the steel plating plant next to a school, he said, \"Markland came into an industrial area, so they have a legal right to set up shop\".\nDunn asked Solorio if the city is now looking at regulation to limit this, and Solorio responded, \"We always have opportunities to look at our General Plan, and we need to have solid facts to make those decisions\". Dunn asked Dr. Wallerstein, \"what about this pocket of businesses in south Santa Ana, is that unusual?\" Wallerstein responded, \"Senator, I don't think that's an issue\".\nDunn then opened up the floor to public questions and comments. One mother of three asked, \"when are we going to have answers?\", while a younger woman said, directed toward the AQMD, \"your job is to know if this is going to give kids leukemia. I'm very disappointed\". One woman said, \"I live in Heninger Park, where all of the kids are getting Leukemia. I've been trying to tell the city and Code Enforcement about illegal underground painters and mechanics who leave paint and fumes behind; which is causing residents to leave\".\nThere was intense debate over the public officials' efforts to investigate health quality at the location in question. Parents expressed their concerns about water quality and illegal activities in the community; and spoke about their children's various health problems, from high copper and lead levels in the bloodstream, to respiratory and lung problems, and cancer."}

Oil was discovered in April of this year.\nGeologists have long suspected the presence of oil in the south of the Sudan. Clivenden Sudan, which Eronat personally owned in 2003, had a high level of expertise in the country's geology.\nThe twenty five year deal secured by Clivenden Sudan will see it pay the Sudanese government $8m in the event oil is produced. The government will also receive 70% of the profits from the oil.\nIn a statement to Channel 4 News, Eronat said that he is not a shareholder or officer of Cliveden Sudan, that he does not work for or financially benefit from Cliveden Sudan, and that Cliveden Sudan is not the operator of the concession, only a shareholder.\nCliveden Sudan itself said \"there has been no commercial oil find in Block C [the area being explored for oil].\"\nVillages in Darfur 180km from the Clivenden Sudan wells have been attacked by Sudanese troops and aircraft.\nEronat became involved in the deal through Lebanese businessman Eli Calil, who has been accused of funding a failed coup in Equatorial Guinea last year (allegations denied by Calil). Calil and Eronat live near each other in the London suburb of Chelsea.\nAt least one rebel group in Darfur is certain the search for oil will inflame the conflict in Darfur. The Justice and Equality Movement wants exploration to stop until peace is established.\nA member of the JEM, Ahmad Hussein, told Channel 4 News: \"So when they say they discover oil in Darfur, who is going to benefit from that? Are they the people of Darfur? Of course not. Absolutely not, the only beneficiaries is the ruling elite and ruling minority of the regime.\"\nEronat changed his nationality from American to British in October 2003, shortly before the deal was signed. Under US law, he could have faced up to ten years imprisonment and/or fines of $500,000, due to US sanctions on Sudan.\nThe UK government has been at the forefront of efforts to try and halt the crisis, with international development minister Hilary Benn making a statement to the house of commons yesterday after a visit to the region.

The demonstrations also brought along a strong resistance of various social sectors to possible appointment of Hormando Vaca Diez, president of the Senate, or Mario Coss\u00edo, president of the House of Representatives, who constitutionally would have to succeed departing president Carlos Mesa, who resigned on Monday night.\nNevertheless, at 22:45 local time (02:45 UTC on Friday), Congress resumed the session, accepted unanimously the renunciation of Mesa, and named Rodriguez Veltz\u00e9, a 49-year-old lawyer from Cochabamba, as the new temporary president of the country, after Vaca Diez and Cossio declined their rights of succession. In his acceptance speech, Rodriguez Veltz\u00e9 said he's convinced that his mandate \"has to do with a renewal of the system\" and promised to call the anticipated elections in a maximum of 150 days, just as the Bolivian Constitution says. Besides, he asked his countrymen to \"give him a necessary and prudent time to elect a new constitutional president\" and to \"stop all the pressures and all the mobilizations\".\nThe coca leader Evo Morales, main opponent of Mesa and Vaca Diez, has previously endorsed the appointment of Rodriguez Veltz\u00e9 and, although he wants a constitutional assembly, probably desists as the temporary president fulfills his promise to call anticipated polls, possibly next December. By aside, the Congress would have that to call to parliamentary elections, since the Constitution only obliges the temporary president to call assemblies for president and vice president. "}

However, the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) and the Asian Development Bank (AsDB) will \"not\" cancel debts owed to them by heavily indebted poor countries (HIPCs) such as Bolivia, Nicaragua, Honduras, Guyana, Vietnam, and Laos.\nThe countries to receive debt cancellation from the IMF, WB and the African Development Fund are Benin, Bolivia, Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, Ghana, Guyana, Honduras, Madagascar, Mali, Mauritania, Mozambique, Nicaragua, Niger, Rwanda, Senegal, Tanzania, Uganda, and Zambia.\nThe deal, devised by the United Kingdom, could potentially free up government revenue for domestic spending on things such as education and health services. \nThe World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the African Development Fund will write off all of the money owed to them by the above listed nations. A total of $40bn will be cleared, which will save debt repayments of $1.5bn a year.\nCADTM argues that this is a negligible effort by the rich countries, since $1.5bn a year is extremely small compared to the $350bn the G8 devote to farming subsidies or the $700bn they spend in military expenditure each year. Moreover, these 18 countries only represent about 5% of the population of developing countries.\nAnother twenty countries may become eligible to have their debts cleared if they meet criteria decided by G8 finance ministries. \nAccording to G8 representatives, the main criteria are the reduction of corruption and better government. According to critics, such as the CADTM, the criteria include the privatisation of natural resources and of strategic economic sectors to the benefit of transnational corporations, higher costs of health care and education through privatisation, a rise in VAT, free flow of capital, which leads to capital leaving the country as shown by several UNCTAD reports, lower tariff protection, which leads to thousands of small and middle producers losing their livelihoods because they cannot compete with imported goods.\nThe CADTM claims that the G8 agreement \"can solve neither the issue of the debt nor the issue of poverty since it bears on only 2% of the external debt of developing countries\" and demand \"an immediate and complete cancellation of the public external debt of all developing countries, the burden of the debt being a major obstacle to meeting fundamental human needs.\"\nOther groups, including charities, have similarly stated that the debts of 62 countries need to be cleared if the UN wants to meet its target of halving world poverty.\nFourteen of the countries to receive debt relief are in sub-Saharan Africa.\nThe alleviation of third world debt has been a lifelong ambition of Gordon Brown, the current UK chancellor, and he has used all of his political power and status to push for this agreement in the G8 group."}

The crisis began after the exposure of a series of scandals which involve the Workers' Party, the Brazilian ruling party. \nIn 2002, Celso Daniel, the mayor of Santo Andr\u00e9, 10 km (6 miles) away from the S\u00e3o Paulo city, was murdered. Daniel was a member of the ruling Workers' Party. The mayor's brother says that Daniel died because he was in disagreement to a supposed bribe conspiracy organized by some Workers' Party members. The case remains under investigation by police. \nIn 2004, the former adviser to the government of President Lula, Waldomiro Diniz, was accused of negotiating with \"bicheiros\" (men who deal with: \"Jogo do Bicho\", or illegal gambling) and extorting money for Workers' Party (PT) electoral campaigns. A supposed victim of extortion released a tape exposing Diniz. The tape's authenticity has been verified by experts and it was aired by the major Brazilian television stations. A Congressional special commission was proposed by non-government parties so the denunciation could be investigated. The government succeeded in stopping the creation of the commission. \nOn March 16, the leading Brazilian magazine Veja published a story saying that according to documents of the Brazilian Agency of intelligence (Abin) the Workers' Party received 5 million dollars to be used by political campaigns of their candidates in 2002 from the Colombian communist armed group Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC-EP). Abin said that the documents were not authentic.\nLast month, some men, supposedly involved in illicit negotiations with the Brazilian Post Service recorded a video which shows former Post Office Chief, Maur\u00edcio Marinho, during a supposed bribe negotiation. In the tape, Marinho receives and puts in his pocket R$3,000 (about 1,259 USD) in cash. He insinuates that the scheme is commanded by deputy Roberto Jefferson. The recording was aired by the major Brazilian television stations.\nRoberto Jefferson is the president of the government-allied Brazilian Labor Party (PTB). Lula da Silva said in a earlier occasion that he \"would give to Jefferson a bank check in blank\", what means that he had high confidence on Jefferson. \nStill related to the Post Office case, on June 2, L\u00eddio Duarte, the former president of IRB, a government enterprise, denied allegations that money from some Brazilian government enterprises was going to PTB, Jefferson's party. An earlier story published by magazine Veja, said that Duarte was a victim of extortion by a representative of PTB. According to Veja, Duarte resigned from the Presidency of IRB, because he had difficulties in continuing to give more money to PTB. L\u00eddio denied this story to the police, and furthermore he said that he never have had an interview with Veja's journalists.\nOn June 8, the magazine Veja released for download in its webpage, an audio tape where it can be heard the voice of Lidio Duarte during an alleged interview to Veja. In the tape, Lidio Duarte talks about being under pressure because someone was asking him more contribution in money for PTB. The tape contradicts the Duarte's testimony to the police and because of that, he became subject of investigation by the authorities. The name of the deputy Roberto Jefferson is cited by Duarte in the alleged recorded interview to Veja.\nAfter the Post Office scandal been exposed, the Brazilian Congress proposed the creation of a Congress' special commission, so it could be investigated by the Parliament. The government, however, protested against it, arguing that political adversaries were anticipating the dispute to the next election for Brazil's Presidency. Workers' Party senator Eduardo Suplicy protested in Senate against his party decision. Because that he was very criticized and he got subject to punishment by the Workers' Party. \nOn June 6, Roberto Jefferson told the Brazilian newspaper Folha de S\u00e3o Paulo that the ruling Workers' Party (PT) has payed Brazilian deputies 30 thousand Brazilian Reals (US 12 thousand) each, every month. The stock markets went down and the U.S. Dollar increased its value in relation to the Brazilian Real. A new Congress' special commission was proposed by some Brazilian senators, so Jefferson's allegations could be investigated. The Workers' Party says that Jefferson's allegations were untrue and that he had no proofs.\nAfter Jefferson's denunciation the focus of the scandal moved to the government and the ruling Workers' Party. Because the government were under pressure, the Workers' Party changed his earlier decision of stopping the creation of a Congress' special commission for the Post Office scandal. The proposal for the creation of a Congress' special commission for the Post Office scandal was approved.\nOn June 9, there was the first meeting of members of the Congress' special commission for the Post Office scandal. Because of unsolved disputes between government's parliamentarians and the other parties representatives, the meeting could not continue. The government's block argued that it must choose the president and the report for the commission, since the government commission members are the majority. Other parties argue that according to Parliament tradition the government should choose one member for the presidency or report and the opposition should choose the other member.\nA new meeting was scheduled to the next week, on Tuesday, June 14.\nBesides these scandals, the current Social Security Minister, Romero Juc\u00e1, is accused of having\noffered seven non-existent farms as guarantee for a financing from the Banco of Amazonia, among other denunciations of misuse of public loans. The current President of Brazilian Central Bank, Henrique Meirelles, is accused of financial fraud among other accusations. Also there is a denunciation of a irregular transference of founds of Central Bank to the construction of a new headquarter for the Workers' Party.\nOn June 4, during the so called Curupira operation, the Brazilian Federal Police arrested members of IBAMA, a Brazilian agency for environment. Among other accusations, they are accused of selling irregular licenses for deforestation in Amazon. At least one of the suspects, a Workers' Party affiliate, is under suspection of have used the money for the political campaign of a Worker's Party candidate in Mato Grosso.\nBesides the commission to investigate the Post Office scandal, another Congress' special commissions were suggested by non-government members of Brazilian Senate: a commission to investigate the IRB scandal and another one to the investigation of Roberto Jefferson's allegations. Also, it is expected that the Brazilian Courts rule against the earlier government decision of stopping the creation of a commission for the investigation of the alleged Waldomiro Diniz scandal. \nRepercussions.\nThe scandals involving the ruling Workers' Party are receiving a good attention by the public and the media. According to the Senator Pedro Simon (center-left, PMDB), an old member of Senate, one reason is because that one of the mains Workers' Party mottos was the fight against corruption. But after Lula became President on 2003, the government and the Workers' Party has been envolved in a series of severe scandals and the government has tried to stop the investigations, which is suspicious. Besides that, all scandals originated inside the government, according to Simon. The Waldomiro and the Post Office scandals emerged after the denunciations of people supposedly under pressure and involved in these scandals. \nAccording to members of Brazilian Court, President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva may be subjected to an impeachment process, if there is some proof that he is really envolved on some of the alleged scandals, or case someone can proof that he was acting with negligence.\nPart of opposition avoids talking about impeachment. According to the governor of Minas Gerais, A\u00e9cio Neves (left, PSDB), \"President Lula is not President Collor\". President Fernando Collor de Mello was submitted to a impeachment process in 1992 because of alleged denounciations of corruption in his government.\nCesar Maia (center-right, PFL), the Mayor of Rio de Janeiro, and one of the probable adversaries of Lula in the next election for President, said that he still believes that Lula can explain all the corruption allegations against his government. But he also said that if Lula doesn't succedd explaining the scandals, he will require the President's impeachment.\nSome of the harsh critics to Lula's government comes from the Senator Helo\u00edsa Helena (left, PSOL). Her party, PSOL, is a dissidence of Workers' Party and the party claims that all denountiation must be investigated, besides the alleged government efforts by the party that the government is trying to stop the investigations. \nThe Senator Dem\u00f3stenes Torres (PFL) is another harsh critic of the alleged Lula's scandals. He cited the former deposed President Fernando Collor de Mello, during some of his discurses in Brazilian Senate.\nAccording to the journalist Boris Casoy, from \"Rede Record\" Television channel, it can be seen written in some places in Brasilia the name of the President Lula written as \"Lulla\" (with double \"l\"). The name of the former deposed President Fernando Collor de Mello also has a double \"l\".\nIn S\u00e3o Paulo, the labour union \"For\u00e7a Sindical\" is organizing protests against corruption in Brasil. The other major labour \"CUT\", which is linked to Workers' Party, said that don't want to take part on it.\nLula's future.\nUntil now, politicians, even those from opposition to the government , were trying to preserve the personal image of the President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva. However, as new denountiations arise and the government has not succeed in explaining, the permanence of Lula in the Presidency becomes difficult, because of popular pressure.\nIt is also possible that all the inquiries finish in an inconclusive form, as has already happened with some old cases investigated by Brazilian Congress.\nBut, even if Congress and the Senate choose not to blame Lula, his reputation certainly will still remain harmed. According to Senator Antonio Carlos Magalh\u00e3es (PFL), \"Lula's re-election has gone.\" \nAt present time, there is a general consensus that Lula will have to work hard if he wishes to get re-elected."}

To counter this Mr. Glazer apparently intends to raise ticket prices by about 50% and to increase revenues by 52% to \u00a3245.6m (from \u00a3161.5m this year) over the next five years. Apart from ticket price increases, this jump in revenue will be achieved by a 61% jump in match day sales, a 13% increase in media sales, and a 76% rise in sales of merchandise and other commercial activities.\nAs part of his plans, expenditure on player transfers will be capped at just \u00a325m a year. This is a very low figure for a English football club endeavouring to win domestic and European trophies. Seven years ago the club spent \u00a328m on players, since then expenditure in England on players has increased hugely."}

The temperature on the surface is estimated between 400 to 750 degrees Fahrenheit (200 to 400 degrees Celsius), and is too hot for life forms that are similar to those found on Earth.\n\"A planet seven and a half times the mass of the Earth could easily hold onto an atmosphere,\" explained Gregory Laughlin, an assistant professor of astronomy at the University of California in Santa Cruz. \"It would still be considered a rocky planet, probably with an iron core and a silicate mantle. It could even have a dense steamy water layer. I think what we are seeing here is something that's intermediate between a true terrestrial planet like the Earth and a hot version of the ice giants Uranus and Neptune.\"\nAstronomers are continuing to advance the science of detecting extrasolar worlds. \"We are pushing a whole new regime at Keck [Observatory in Hawaii] to achieve one meter per second precision, triple our old precision, that should also allow us to see Earth-mass planets around sun-like stars within the next few years,\" Butler said."}

Microsoft is changing the Chinese version of its blogging portal MSN Spaces to reject certain words deemed contentious \u2014 words such as 'democracy', 'freedom', 'human rights', and 'Taiwan independence'. The company states that the purpose of this action is to comply with local laws in China, a country with heavy regulation of online speech. This follows on the heels of an earlier action taken by the government of the People's Republic of China that required all Chinese bloggers to register their web journals with the government.\nEver since the Communist Party of China (CPC) took control of the government in 1945, the press has been strictly regulated, but with the advent of the internet, there were worries on the part of the CPC on whether their influence on the Chinese media would hold. As Chinese officials called for a more regulated internet, outsiders dismissed such regulation as impossible and contradictory of what the internet stands for. Yet government censorship prevailed with the installation of a complex system of proxies and firewalls (colloquially known as the Great Firewall of China), blocking Chinese internet users from accessing sites that ran counter to the censorship policy. A further crackdown in 2003 resulted in the closure of many internet caf\u00e9s and the arrest of dozens of users.\nWith this recent action, Microsoft has come under scrutiny by Reporters Without Borders. Microsoft has issued a statement saying that it is its policy to comply with local laws and regulations of each country where it operates. Microsoft is not the only company obliging to the censorship policy of the People's Republic of China \u2014 Nortel, Yahoo! and Google have been criticised for similar measures.

Shaik was found guilty by Durban High Court of two counts of corruption and one of fraud and was sentenced to 15 years imprisonment.\nThe President has called this one of his toughest decisions. Opposition leader of the Democratic Alliance immediately praised the president for holding \"principle over politics\", and, while deeply saddened, former president Nelson Mandela supported Mbeki's decision. Jacob Zuma was the favourite of the ruling African National Congress party to succeed Thabo Mbeki as president.\nFollowing this ordeal, the government of South Africa has reaffirmed its dedication to the reduction and eventual elimination of corruption in all areas of politics.\nUPDATE (July 7)\nThe African National Congress held a meeting of it's National General Council over the weekend of 2-3 July. Zuma attracted a lot of favourable attention, mostly from people who wished to defeat policy initiatives that included relaxing some of the legal constraints on employers. He was reinstated as ANC deputy president and, in a first for the party, granted a salary (details not revealed).

Like the previous bomb blast reported Tuesday, it was relatively small and produced only three injuries and no fatalities. This is in stark contrast to bombs detonated over the weekend in Ahwaz and Tehran, which produced a dozen fatalities and scores of injuries.\nThe Ahwaz bomb went off in a fast-food restaurant at 7:50 PM local time.\nA government spokesperson said both bombings were \"...anti-[Islamic] revolution elements against innocent people.\"\nAcross the border, Iraqi Prime Minister Ibrahim al-Jafari issued a denunciation of the bombings and called for closer anti-terrorism cooperation between the countries of the Middle East.\nIt is not clear who has truly been behind the string of Zahedan and Tehran bombings. Three little-known Arab separatist groups operating in the rebellious Khuzestan province have claimed credit for the bombings there, but no one has stepped forward to claim the others. \nAt first, after the earliest attacks, the government seemed to blame the Mojahedin-e-Khalq (MeK) organization. It later expanded its accusations to allege U.S. facilitation and imply infiltration via U.S. occupied Iraq or Afghanistan, both of which share extensive borders with Iran. The MeK, which formerly operated under Saddam Hussein's protection in Iraq, has claimed bombings in the past, but vehemently denies participating in the recent spate of attacks. The group seems to have moved away from violent acts in recent years as it tries to curry favor with Western governments and shed its terrorist image (the group is currently listed on U.S. and many European terrorist watch lists). The affiliated National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI) has also denied involvement. \nOn March 30, a previously unknown group called \"The 70 Million People of Iran\" issued a statement hinting at violent resistance to the current regime --- but only \"after\" a June 18 deadline, which has not yet passed.\nReformist candidate Mostafa Moin has raised the possibility that rouge hardline Islamist groups planted the bombs to frighten people into choosing a military-affiliated candidate. Moin, currently running number two in the polls behind former president and current Discernment Council chairman Akbar Hashemi Rasfanjani, also threatened to pull out of the race and ask his supporters to boycott elections to protest the treatment of his running mates and supporters, several of whom have been attacked by extremist mobs."}

To combat the aggressive jury selection strategy undertaken by the defense, the prosecution \"basically gave the jury several credit hours worth of an MBA\", teaching them about following paper trails and detecting falsification of business records. It paid off during deliberation as the jury requested over 100 documents to review.\nKozlowski and Swartz directly stole approximately $150 million USD from Tyco and acquired $430 million more by inflating the company's stock value and then secretly selling company shares.

The copies were provided by British reporter Michael Smith, who claims he destroyed the original documents to protect the sources. An anonymous senior British official said the documents appeared authentic.\nThe documents were leaked on 18 September 2004 to The Daily Telegraph in an article titled \"Secret papers show Blair was warned of Iraq chaos\". The documents, however, took 9 months to reach the mainstream press.\nAP is saying that the memos show; \"When Prime Minister Tony Blair's chief foreign policy adviser dined with Condoleezza Rice six months after Sept. 11, the then-U.S. national security adviser didn't want to discuss Osama bin Laden or al-Qaida. She wanted to talk about 'regime change' in Iraq, setting the stage for the U.S.-led invasion more than a year later.\"\n\"U.S. scrambling to establish a link between Iraq and al-Qaida is so far frankly unconvincing,\" British Foreign Office political director Peter Ricketts said in one of the memos. \"For Iraq, `regime change' does not stack up. It sounds like a grudge between Bush and Saddam.\" Ricketts said.\nAnother memo addressed to Foreign Secretary Jack Straw says,\"But even the best survey of Iraq's WMD programs will not show much advance in recent years on the nuclear, missile or CW/BW (chemical or biological weapons) fronts: the programs are extremely worrying but have not, as far as we know, been stepped up.\"\nThe memos express concern about breaking international law but Blair is shown as being determined to go to war as America's ally regardless.\nAn Iraq expert at the University of London, Tony Dodge said, \"The documents show what official inquiries in Britain already have, that the case of weapons of mass destruction was based on thin intelligence and was used to inflate the evidence to the level of mendacity. In going to war with Bush, Blair defended the special relationship between the two countries, like other British leaders have. But he knew he was taking a huge political risk at home. He knew the war's legality was questionable and its unpopularity was never in doubt.\" Dodge also said the memos show that Blair was aware that postwar instability was likely for Iraq.\nIn one of the memos, David Manning, who was Blair's chief foreign policy adviser, reported on a meeting in Washington with Rice: \"It is clear that Bush is grateful for your (Blair's) support and has registered that you are getting flak. I said that you would not budge in your support for regime change but you had to manage a press, a Parliament and a public opinion that was very different than anything in the States. And you would not budge either in your insistence that, if we pursued regime change, it must be very carefully done and produce the right result. Failure was not an option.\"\nA March 22 memo from Ricketts to Foreign Secretary Straw said, \"We have to be convincing that: the threat is so serious/imminent that it is worth sending our troops to die for; it is qualitatively different from the threat posed by other proliferators who are closer to achieving nuclear capability (including Iran).\" "}

The site, called Wikitorial, uses a type of software known as a wiki. Registered users over 13 years of age may edit and contribute to designated \"Wikitorials\". On Friday, the Times posted the site's first editorial on latimes.com, entitled \"War and Consequences\". The corresponding Wikitorial is named \"Dreams About War and Retribution\".\nIn its introduction to Wikitorial, a Los Angeles Times editor invited readers to \"rewrite the editorial yourself\" if they thought something could be improved. The unsigned introduction to Wikitorial drew parallels with Wikipedia, which was said to work \"bewilderingly well\". The Times hopes that its self-admitted experiment will help a wider range of people express their opinions on editorial topics. The newspaper has acknowledged that the idea may not work, saying \"Plenty of skeptics are predicting embarrassment; like an arthritic old lady who takes to the dance floor, they say, the Los Angeles Times is more likely to break a hip than to be hip.\"\n\"War and Consequences\", a traditional editorial, serves as a starting point for wiki users. The opinion piece calls for clearer goals in the United States' current military involvement in Iraq. The author proposes a clear timetable for training Iraqi troops and police officers, and states that people need to be held responsible for intelligence failures leading up to the war, and failures to provide sufficient troops during and after the war.\nThe corresponding wikitorial, named \"Dreams About War and Retribution\", initially started as an exact copy of \"War and Consequences\" when it was posted on June 17. Since then it has been edited over 150 times. The original editorial confined itself to points supporting two basic claims: The need for a timetable, and the need for responsibility. In contrast, the wikitorial has increased the original scope considerably, weighing in on topics such as the Downing Street memo and drawing analogies to the Philippine-American War. One contributor even accused the American media, including the L.A. Times itself, of dereliction due to their uncritical coverage of the U.S. administration shortly before the 2003 invasion of Iraq.\nAs of mid day today, June 19th, the LATWiki Main Page has been replaced with the text \"Where is the wikitorial?

The problem arose when Michelin discovered that its tires were incapable of more than ten laps at race pace.\nThe first indication of trouble was when the rear left tire of Ralf Schumacher's Toyota racecar exploded during practice on Friday. Schumacher's car collided with the track wall while travelling at 300 km/h (approx. 186 miles/h), leaving him shaken but generally unharmed. However, further investigations by Michelin revealed that another ten tires had suffered problems, with one also failing on track.\nAll the problems occurred on the rear left tire during the two long 90 degree corners leading onto the main straight. The nine degree banking and grooves cut into the surface of the track compounded problems.\nIt is believed that Michelin may not have properly accounted for the grooves cut into the Indianapolis track to improve grip for Indy cars after the track was resurfaced. Indy cars have smaller down-force generating wings so need more grip from their tires than Formula One cars.\nBridgestone, the other tire manufacturer currently in Formula One, did not have similar problems. It is possible that their US subsidiary, Firestone, who supplied tires for an Indy car race after the resurfacing, may have sent information back to their Formula One tires department in Japan. The three teams running Bridgestone tires - Ferrari, Jordan and Minardi - were therefore able to compete without any safety concerns.\nUnder FIA racing regulations, the only course of action was for the Michelin runners to withdraw from the race on safety grounds. Rules prevented alternative tires from being flown from France overnight, although Michelin were unsure whether these tires were also affected by the problem.\nDrivers and teams had also suggested building a chicane to slow cars down between the corners, but Ferrari opposed the idea, and ultimately the FIA rejected the idea under regulations.\nActually the FIA rules states that the tyres manufacters should provide two sets of tyres for the race. One normal, optimized for performance, and one optimized for safety, to be used when the normal one set could not be used. In this case the safe set was not present.\nThe 123,000 fans watching from the stands were unaware of the farce unfolding below them until the parade lap before the race.\nThe fourteen Michelin runners peeled off into the pit lane rather than take up their starting positions on the grid. However, at least one driver, David Coulthard told his team that he was willing to race on the tires in question, had the decision been left up to him.\nFans jeered and booed as they realised what was happening, and a small number began throwing bottles and cans onto the track.\nRubens Barrichello, in a Ferrari, ran over one bottle of water at high speed which exploded in a spray of droplets.\nFans started stamping in the stands on the finish line straight, causing them to shake.\nA British ITV filmcrew spoke to some fans. \"I paid $85 for three-day ticket. I travelled nine hours from Baltimore to be here. Indy cars wouldn't do this. NASCAR wouldn't do this. I'll never attend a race again - only watch on TV.\"\nOther fans had travelled from Mexico and Panama to watch the race, and said they wanted refunds.\nA Police Captain also talked to ITV, saying he'd never seen fans as angry as this before. If trouble flared, they could call on 400-500 officers from local and state police, Indianapolis Police Department and the FBI under contingency plans.\nThe race was eventually won by Michael Schumacher from his Ferrari teammate Rubens Barrichello. Jordan's Tiago Monteiro finished third. Despite what was clearly a one-manufacturer race for the win, both Ferrari drivers did indeed race one another hard, with them almost colliding following Schumacher's exit from the pit lane after his second pitstop, with Barrichello having to take to the infield to avoid spinning off. Following the race, the two drivers did not speak."}

After years of claims, Kilby agreed to share credit for the invention with Robert Noyce, the co-founder of chip maker Intel.\nHis contribution to the pioneering breakthrough of the integrated circuit was made by Kilby during his employment with Texas Instruments (TI) in 1958. He also is credited with co-inventing the handheld calculator which made TI the leader in early consumer electronics development. The integrated circuit paved the way in the development of the microchip used today in computers, DVD players, interactive video games and cell phones.\nKilby's work includes the awarding of 60 patents. It was said of him in a statement by TI chairman Tom Engihous that, \"In my opinion, there are only a handful of people whose works have truly transformed the world and the way we live in it \u2014 Henry Ford, Thomas Edison, the Wright Brothers and Jack Kilby.\"\nIn his first year working with TI, Kilby's work on what became the forerunner to the microchip was an invention he fabricated by using a sliver of germanium on a glass slide. This invention was the predecessor to the semiconductor that ultimately replaced vacuum tubes and switching wires then in use as the transistor devices. The invention also led to solid state electronics able to withstand more shock and impact in handling.\nKilby is recognised for his 'seminal thought' on the integrated circuit by being awarded the Robert N. Noyce Award in 1995, the Semiconductor Industry Association's highest honor. He is survived by two daughters and five grandchildren."}

After a Houston, Texas television station \"KPRC\" reported on chat room names such as \"Girls 13 And Under For Older Guys\" and \"Girls 13 And Up For Much Older Men\" that were aimed at sex with children, the publicly held business \"Yahoo!\" was compelled to act by shutting down all chat rooms created by users and stopped the ability to create new user chat rooms. Online chat rooms created by the company itself are still in service and use.\nMajor brand name advertisers such as PepsiCo Inc., Georgia-Pacific Corp., State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co., Countrywide Mortgage and T-Mobile withdrew ads placed on \"Yahoo!\" web pages that may have come under association with the offensive chat rooms. The company is also faced with a lawsuit seeking $10 million in damages that was filed by watchdog groups of internet portals on behalf of the parents and a 12-year-old victim of molestation. A man, who once operated a \"Yahoo Groups\" site where members traded child pornography, is also involved in the suit.\nOther internet portals, such as \"AOL\" and \"MSN\", also allow users to create their own chat rooms. These internet portals are different from \"Yahoo!\" in that they are subscription based, and only allow access to the rooms if the user is a subscriber to the service. \"MSN\" in its earliest versions of chat had monitors watch activity on its servers, but it was abandoned. Efforts to monitor chat for any effect appear to be futile. Geoff Sutton, the European general manager of Microsoft MSN, told \"Wired News\" at the time it cut free chat service in 28 countries that, \"The straightforward truth of the matter is free, unmediated chat isn't safe.\"\nAccording to a \"Reuters\" news story by Duncan Martell, an investigation by the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation that was targeted at \"Yahoo Groups\" users resulted in the arrest of more than 100 people in the United States. The lawsuit now brought against \"Yahoo!\" was filed on May 9 in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas. It charges that \"Yahoo!\" breached its duties in internet providership by allowing co-defendant Mark Bates and others to share child pornography on a chat room site called 'Candyman'.\n\"Yahoo!'s\" terms of use requires persons who create chat rooms to agree not to make available content that is \"unlawful, harmful, threatening, abusive, harassing, defamatory, vulgar, obscene, libelous or otherwise objectionable.\" Legal rulings to date imply that if internet service provider's do monitor the activity in chat rooms, they incur some responsibility for its content, similarly to a publisher's responsibility for the content found in one of its books.\nThe result is software providers who take a \"hands-off\" approach grant internet users the ability to add and create content to the World Wide Web that opens the door to contributions that range from great to sometimes objectionable, to out-right illegal, and often enlightening.

Two males and two females were suspected of robbing a Shell gas station, and one boy was described as having red hair and red pants. Robins was searching the surrounding area approximately 3.2 miles away from the incident when he found a group of ten people that included one male matching the red hair, red pants description.\nRobins had spoken to another officer just minutes earlier to discuss how to handle the potential suspects. They decided \"that the best way to handle the situation was probably to advise them to all get on the ground, possibly at gunpoint, if the circumstances warranted,\" Robins wrote.\nThe group stopped by Robins included seven male students and three teachers from Stone School who were out for a walk. Robins detained this group until backup could arrive to confirm their identities and whether or not they were involved in the armed robbery. They were released after back-up officers arrived and it was determined the students were not the suspects.\nOfficer Keith Robins has returned to active duty. He was placed on desk duty and paid administrative leave during the investigation of the April 11 incident.\nPolice Chief Daniel Oates remarked \"I'm proud to say that the officer involved recognized his mistake and offered to go to the school to apologize to the students and staff who were affected; for various reasons, that did not occur, but it says a lot about our officer that he extended that offer.\"\nSchool district spokeswoman Liz Margolis said officials were informed of the conclusion of the internal investigation. She said school staff members and parents jointly decided not to accept Robins' offer to personally apologize, but said police officials had visited the school twice after the incident to talk to students.\n\"The school has moved beyond this, so they felt they didn't want to bring it up again,\" Margolis said. \"The police department has kept up good communication with the school through the entire investigative process.\"\nAccording to Ann Arbor Police Department documents there are defined levels of \"Use of Force\" for differing circumstances.

Unlike traditional news sources, OhmyNews allows any individual with an Internet connection to contribute stories. A professional staff of journalists vets incoming submissions and decides which stories are to be published.\nThe project is sponsoring the forum in order to promote its English edition, officially launched in May 2004. Citizen reporters writing in English exchange ideas and stories, and try to understand the inner workings of the Korean edition. The conference is sponsored by Korean corporations such as Samsung, SK Corporation, LG, Yuhan-Kimberly, and Asiana Airlines.\nConference events.\nSpeakers include Ken Takeuchi, president of JanJan, Shintaro Tabata, head of news service at Japan\u2019s Livedoor, Professor Clyde Bentley from the University of Missouri and MyMissourian.com, Professor Neil Thurman from City University London, Jeremy Iggers from the Minneapolis Star Tribune, and Erik M\u00f6ller from Wikinews.\nConference participants were welcomed by OhmyNews founder and CEO on Thursday evening. On Friday, they toured briefly through Seoul's technology sector, including a visit to the \"Ubuiquitous Dream\" exhibition and Samsung's technology showroom. \"Ubiquitous Dream\" is meant to demonstrate Korea's vision of ubiquitous computing, including Internet-enabled refrigerators, household robots and voice recognition. Afterwards, conference attendees visited the OhmyNews news room, including a studio used for producing streaming video. \nVisitors were given a chance to take a look at the Cheonggyecheon restoration site, an attempt to transform a riverbed into an avenue with parks and fountains. The restoration project manager gave an overview of the effort, and Seoul's mayor Lee Myung Bak briefly highlighted his vision of Korean city development.\nAt the end of Friday's events, speakers and citizen reporters alike met in the Grand Ballroom of the COEX Convention and Exhibition Center. Oh Yeon Ho gave a brief but passionate speech about his project: \"We are from different countries and many of us have a different skin color, but we share one struggle: Every citizen is a journalist.\" He stated that citizen journalism needs \"sustainable business models\" to survive. OhmyNews is funded by advertising and subscriptions. He also pointed out the need for different citizen journalism projects to collaborate, and announced the creation of a global alliance to this end.\nAfter Oh's speech, Chin Dae Je, South Korea's Minister of Information and Communication, gave a presentation about ubiquitous computing and the future of the information and communications technology sector in Korea. Lastly, many different citizen reporters, including an 11-year-old from Utah, told their stories about how they joined the OhmyNews community and participated in group photos and a flag ceremony."}

I'm telling you, I've lived with these people and they're better,\" Lauer said.\nCruise hinted that Lauer was promoting Ritalin and Lauer scoffed: \"I am not. I'm telling you in their cases, in their individual case, it worked.\"\nThe exchange ended when the two basically agreed to disagree. Cruise, who is 42, did admit that one of his goals is to speak more about Scientology in an effort to get people to understand it better.\nScientology has historically been at odds with the established medical and mental health community. The rift dates back to the 1950s and Scientology's founding father L. Ron Hubbard. In his book, \"Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health\", published in 1950, Hubbard claims that Dianetics (later called Scientology) could cure the majority of human ailments. These claims were sharply disputed by a variety of mainstream science and medical professionals including psychiatrists.\nOn Monday, June 27, 2005, the American Psychiatric Association released a statement that stated the following:\n\"It is irresponsible for Mr. Cruise to use his movie publicity tour to promote his own ideological views and deter people with mental illness from getting the care they need...Rigorous, published, peer-reviewed research clearly demonstrates that treatment (of mental illness) works...It is unfortunate that in the face of this remarkable scientific and clinical progress that a small number of individuals and groups persist in questioning its legitimacy.\"\nThe APA represents nearly 36,000 physicians specialising in the diagnosis and treatment of mental illness."}

Property prices have dropped for 14 years in a row (40% from their peak in 1991); and yet, the rise in prices in Japan during the decade before 1991 was less than the increase over the past ten years in most of today's \"housing boom\" countries.\nThe total value of residential property rose by more than $30 trillion over the past five years in developed economies, an increase equivalent to 100% of the combined GDPs of those countries. This increase dwarfs all previous house-price booms and is greater than the global stockmarket bubble in the late 1990s. Much of the recent housing activity is being driven by speculative demand. The National Association of Realtors (NAR) reported that 23% of all American houses bought in 2004 were for investment, not for owners to live in. Another 13% were bought as second homes. NAR also found that 42% of all first-time buyers made no down-payment on their home purchase last year.\nMany investors are buying solely because they think prices will keep rising, which is a warning sign of a financial bubble. In Miami, Florida, as many as half of the original buyers resell new apartments even before they are built, and properties can change hands two or three times before somebody finally moves in.\nBritain's Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) reported prices have been falling for ten consecutive months. Forty nine percent of their surveyors reported falling prices in May. This was the weakest report since 1992 during Britain's previous house-price bust."}

Below are some of the main denunciations and witnesses.\nIn May, the Brazilian deputy Roberto Jefferson was involved in an alleged corruption scheme that involved the Brazilian Postal Service. Jefferson said that he was unfairly being abandoned and sacrificed. In addition he said that he would not take the fall alone. \nOn June 6, Roberto Jefferson told the Brazilian newspaper Folha de S\u00e3o Paulo that the ruling\nWorkers' Party (PT) has been paying Brazilian deputies 30 thousand Brazilian Reais (USD 12 thousand) each, every month, in return for support. Jefferson later confirmed to a Congressional special commission what he had previously stated to the newspaper. Also he added that he had informed the Minister Jos\u00e9 Dirceu about the payments and that no action was taken. Dirceu denied Jefferson's allegations.\nAccording to Jefferson the payments only stopped after he informed the President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva. He also said that the Minister Jos\u00e9 Dirceu should leave the government, otherwise President Lula would get involved. Two days later, the Minister Jos\u00e9 Dirceu announced his resignation from his post.\nJefferson denied involvement in the Brazilian Postal Service scandal. Jefferson told the commission that the Brazilian Agency of Intelligence (Abin) was controlled by the former Brazilian Minister of Civil Affairs Jos\u00e9 Dirceu and it recorded the tape which shows the former Brazilian Postal Service Chief Maur\u00edcio Marinho during a supposed bribery negotiation with a businessman.\nHowever Jefferson admitted that he received R$ 4 million from the Workers' Party (PT). According to Jefferson, during a meeting with him and the PTB treasurer \u00c9merson Palmieri, the Workers' Party treasurer Del\u00fabio Soares and the Workers' Party President Jos\u00e9 Geno\u00edno, they decided that PTB should received R$ 20 million. Jefferson said he received only R$ 4 million and the money was delivered by the businessman Marcos Val\u00e9rio Fernandes de Souza, owner of publicity enterprises. \nOn June 14, Fernanda Karina Ramos Somaggio denounced his former boss Marcos Val\u00e9rio and told the Brazilian magazine \"Isto\u00c9 - Dinheiro\" that she saw suitcases full of money leaving the enterprise during the time she worked for him as secretary (Isto\u00c9 article). Also she said that Marcos Val\u00e9rio encountered Workers' Party members several times, including Del\u00fabio Soares. On June 15, the secretary denied everything what she said to \"Isto\u00c9 - Dinheiro\" to police. However, on June 20, Karina Somaggio said that she lied to the police because she and her family were threatened. In a new testimony to the Brazilian police, Karina Somaggio confirmed the interview to the magazine and the accusations against her former boss, Marcos Val\u00e9rio. Karina Somaggio is now under police protection. \nMarcos Val\u00e9rio denied the allegations of Karina Somaggio. He has initiated court proceedings against his former secretary.\nSome days later the magazine \"Isto\u00c9\" revealed documents from the Council for Control of Financial Activities (Coaf). According to the documents around R$ 20.9 millions left SMP&amp;B and DNA enterprises, which belong to Marcos Val\u00e9rio (Isto\u00c9 article). The Coaf is a Brazilian public agency which monitors irregular financial activities. The enterprises of Marcos Val\u00e9rio have millionaire contracts with the Brazilian government.\nOn June 21 and 22, parliamentarians listened to the former Brazilian Postal Service Chief Maur\u00edcio Marinho, accused of involvement in the Brazilian Postal Service scandal. At first Marinho refused talking about any illegality in the Brazilian Postal Service. However, on June 22, after his lawyers admitted that he was not telling the whole truth and that they would leave him, Marinho demanded protection for himself and his family, then started to talk. He said the Workers\u2019 Party general-secretary S\u00edlvio Pereira and the Minister Luiz Gushiken had some influence in the Brazilian Postal Service. He said that the biggest Brazilian Postal Service contracts should be investigated and he mentioned big contracts to the Brazilian bank Bradesco. "}

Dr. Friedlander said that inspectors are allowed only 15 seconds of inspection and that unhygienic practices are common in the meat industry; practices such as cow carcasses with abscesses being hosed off, wrapped up and shipped to the consumer.\nFriedlander also claims that some supervisors were more concerned about falsifying inspection documents than protecting consumers and that on June 9, 2005, a cow in Texas with BSE symptoms was sent straight to the rendering plant without testing.\nThere have also been allegations of a \"don't ask,don't tell\" approach being applied by US health officials when confronted with human deaths which may be caused by eating BSE contaminated meat.\nThe Organic Consumers Association reported last year that hundreds of people are dying in the US each year from Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD or vCJD) (the human counterpart of BSE) and the deaths are being written off as \"unexplainable\". The disease causes holes in the brains of the victims.\nA New Jersey lawyer, Janet Skarbek is being called \"the next Erin Brockovich\" for her research into the \"Cherry Hill cluster\" of 12 deaths she said were caused by people eating BSE infected meat; \"I'm up to 12 confirmed cases of CJD, where it says CJD on their death certificates and where they all ate at the same racetrack,\" Skarbek said.\nNew Jersey state officials have said that the 12 deaths did not result from the human form of mad cow disease, but rather from sporadic CJD; but Skarbek says the government's numbers don't add up. \"If you just take five of the victims from New Jersey that ate at the track most recently, two were out of 100 administrative employees and three were out of 1,000 season-pass holders.

Decades ago, cancer often was not discovered until it was very advanced. At that stage, surgical efforts were rarely successful, and many patients died soon after procedures were performed. This may have given rise to the mistaken belief that the surgeries caused the disease to worsen.\nAnother commonly held myth is that there is a cure for cancer, but the medical industry is withholding it in order to continue profiting from the sale of less effective treatments and medications.\nBelievers in this \"conspiracy theory\" may not be guided by it in making their personal health decisions, though. The American Cancer Society says that even though many people are suspicious of the medical industry in general, they have a trusting relationship with their own physicians and are likely to follow their advice.\nAlmost 20 percent of the people surveyed felt that medications for cancer pain were ineffective.\nAbout 10 percent expressed the belief that cancer could be cured with a positive attitude alone, while a similar number felt that there was no effective treatment for cancer.\nThe fact is, cancer survival and treatments -- including pain management -- have vastly improved in the last thirty years.\nResults of the survey appear in the August 1 issue of Cancer, a journal published by the American Cancer Society. \nSources.\n "}

Estonia lost 5 percent of its territory to Russia when authorities delineated the Estonian Soviet Federal Republic from the Russian Soviet Federal Republic in 1945.\nHowever, the Estonian Foreign Ministry has reiterated its stance that the border treaty seals the border with Russia, and the preamble makes no claims to Russian territory. \n\"The Estonian side has repeatedly assured that it has not linked any new issues to the border treaties, and thus, the Russian side's assertion that Estonia has added new aspects to the treaty is ungrounded,\" the foreign ministry said in a statement.\nEstonian and Russian officials first agreed upon the border treaty in 1996, and then initialed them in 1999, according to the website of the Estonian Foreign Ministry. The preamble included with the treaty signed in May stated that the agreement would have no impact on other issues concerning Estonian-Russian bilateral relations and Urmas Paet, the Estonian foreign minister said in a statement on June 27 that Estonia has no land claims to Russia.\n\"Russia does not have the will to normalize relations with Estonia and, I would say, even with the European Union and NATO,\" explained Marko Mihkelson, the deputy chairman of the Estonian foreign relations commission in a statement. \n\"This is because here, indeed, we are talking about Estonian-Russian border, which is not only a border between the two states but also a border between the European Union and Russia,\" he said.\nEstonia is now urging Russia to reconsider its stance, while Lavrov told reporters in Helsinki that the two parties will have to start from scratch.\n "}

The Brazilian deputy Roberto Jefferson said that the ruling party bought the support of some Brazilian deputies, paying 30 thousand Brazilian Reals (US$ 12 thousand) each, every month. Although Jefferson said that he had no proof of this, he gave a very detailed description of the alleged corruption scheme.\nThe testimonies of other witnesses and the investigation that is being made by police gave support for some of the Jefferson's claims. Independent investigation being made by newspapers and magazines, and the publication of documents and other evidences, expose the government and Workers' Party more and more.\nPopular support for the President is deteriorating. Except for the Workers' Party and the Communist Party of Brazil (PCdoB) which are part of the government, there is not another political party in Brazil denying the accusations. All newspapers and magazines publish stories every day related to the scandal. The Workers' Party itself is divided: some members believe that the accusations are true and that something went wrong, others prefer to deny the evidences and they argue that the party is innocent.\nA great part of the work of the Brazilian parliamentarians is related to the investigation of the scandals. Besides the Votes-for-cash scandal dennounced by Jefferson, there are \nthe Bingo's scandal, the Post Office scandal and the Brazilian Reinsurance Institute (IRB) scandal. All of these scandals are being submited to investigation by Brazilian parliamentarians.\nOne important question is whether President Lula knew about the alleged scandals in his government or not. If he knew and he did nothing he was conniving or he participated, it is the worst. If he didn't know, someone can say that he was very incompetent because he didn't see something so big under his nose.\nToday, the authority and the efficiency of the President is being questioned. Some people say that it was the former Minister Jos\u00e9 Dirceu who actually took great part of the decisions in Lula's government. The politicians say that President Lula must take control of his government, that he should do a major reform of his government and that he should get away from the people who are involved in the scandals.\nBesides the corruption dennounciations, the government of President Lula is being criticized by his weak social agenda. The programme called \"Zero Hunger\" has showed little results and many people accuse it of being just a marketing strategy.\nThe management of the economy has being praised by some analysts. However, critics, even inside the government like the Vice-President Jos\u00e9 Alencar have already criticized it, because of the high interest rates. There is not severe inflation, but unemployment is high, and salaries are low.\nThe next days or the next month may be decisive to the future of Lula. He must show that he is not involved in the corruption scandals, he must reform the government and he must prove that he is competent. The positive factor are that the Brazilian economy is not seriously contaminated by the political crisis until now, the population is perplexed but calm and the politicians are not envolving the President in the denunciations, although they demand the investigation of all corruption allegations. However, nobody knows how much this situation will remain or if it will remain until the end of the government of President Lula in 2006.\nSee also.\n "}

Nuclear fusion is the process that powers our sun, and could potentially lead to almost unlimited energy available on Earth.\nThe six partners in the international project \u2014 the European Union (through its suborganization EURATOM), the People's Republic of China, Japan, South Korea, Russia and the United States - declared today in Moscow that the device will be constructed at Cadarache, in France. The other contender for the project was Japan. \nJapan and the EU (as well as Canada until 2003) had fought a long and hard battle to secure the site of the experiment, seen as the next step towards nuclear fusion, until Japan finally withdrew its bid today.\nUnder the terms of the agreement, the EU will pay 50% of the construction costs of the 10 billion euro (\u00a36.6bn) program costs, while Japan will gain 20% of the 200 research jobs that will be part of the project, but pay only 10% of the costs.\n\"We believe that the ITER project should start as soon as possible for the sake of mankind's future,\" said Nariaki Nakayama, Japan's science minister.\nProfessor Sir Chris Llewellyn Smith, head of the of UK Atomic Energy Authority's (UKAEA) Culham division, responsible for the UK's thermonuclear fusion programme, said that \"rapid construction of ITER will be a major step in the development of fusion as a potential large-scale source of electricity that will not contribute to climate change.\"\nFrench environmental groups have shown dismay at the news of the siting decision. Mediane, one such group, said \"We are against the project because it's very dangerous and will not create jobs in the region.\" A group of several French environmental groups, Sortir du Nucleaire (Get Out of Nuclear Energy), said ITER was dangerous as scientists did not know \"how to manipulate the high-energy deuterium and tritium hydrogen isotopes used in the fusion process. ITER will never produce electricity. Maybe, well after ITER, another reactor in 100, 150 or 200 years will do so \u2014 but that's far from certain.\"\nThe JET nuclear fusion project in the UK has operated for twenty years and has used tritium for ten; it has a 100% safety record with no radiation ever being released.\nITER will follow on from the work of such experiments as the European JET, the Japanese JT-60u, and the American TFTR and DIII-D. It is not designed to produce electricity, but to research technologies that will allow a prototype nuclear fusion power plant \u2014 'DEMO' \u2014 to begin construction in around 2030. The ITER program itself will last for thirty years \u2014 ten for construction, and at least 20 years of operation.\nNuclear fusion works by forcing the atomic nuclei \u2014 in this case isotopes of hydrogen, namely deuterium and/or tritium \u2014 to combine under great heat and pressure. The products of the reaction have a lower mass than the original reactants \u2014 releasing energy according to Einstein's famous equation of formula_1.\nThe fuel is derived from sea water, meaning that fusion is an almost limitless source of energy.\nNuclear fusion produces no waste products other than helium, and does not contribute to global warming in any way. Little radiation is produced by the reaction; a nuclear fusion power plant will take less than 100 years to become completely safe after decommissioning. Furthermore, fusion reactors have very little fuel inside them at any one moment \u2014 so therefore no chance of a 'meltdown' \u2014 and can shut down in seconds if the fuel supply is cut off."}

The associations between U.S. Vice President Dick Cheney and Halliburton, have been the basis for repeated speculation over possible political improprieties and business profiteering from the war.\nAmong the senators and representatives present at the hearing were Byron Dorgan (presiding), Henry Waxman, Frank Lautenberg, and Mark Dayton. \nAmong those testifying were Bunny Greenhouse, former Chief Contracting Officer of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Rory Mayberry, former Food Program Manager for Halliburton subsidiary, and Allan Waller, of the Lloyd-Owen International security and operations firm.\nGreenhouse, who provided the bulk of testimony, spoke for several minutes about her involvement in the evaluation and crafting of government Army contracts, and how explaining how superiors undermined and dismissed her concerns of illegal business practices. \"Ultimately my main concern was the repeated insistence that the Rio contract be awarded to KBR without competitive bidding,\" Greenhouse said. She testified to have been given misinformation in answer to her complaints, and being \"overtly misled\" by KBR managers.\nMayberry, still in Iraq, testified by video from questions prepared by the committee. He said that KBR routinely sold expired food rations to the Army. The interviewer asked, \"Are you saying that Halliburton deliberately falsified the number of meals they prepared and then submitted false claims for reimbursement and that they did this to make up for past amounts auditors had disallowed?\" Mayberry firmly answered \"Yes.\" He said that serving expired food ration was \"an everyday occurrence, sometimes every meal.\" He explained that Halliburton systematically overcharged for the number of meals as well, saying, \"they were charging for 20,000 meals and they were only serving 10,000 meals.\" Dorgan later commented, \"obviously there's no honor here, by a company that would serve outdated food to our troops in Iraq.\" \nMayberry also claimed would-be whistleblowers were threatened \"to be sent to Falluja\" and other \"places under fire\" if they talked to media or governmental oversight officials. In 2003 and 2004, Falluja had been well known as dangerous for foreign troops and civilians. \"I personally was sent to Falluja for three weeks. The manager told me that I was being sent away until the auditors were gone, because I had talked to the auditors,\" Mayberry said.\n\"The threat of being sent to a camp under fire was their way of keeping us quiet. The employees who talked to auditors were sent to camps under more fire than other camps, and Anaconda.\" This report led Dorgan and others to voice considerable outrage that U.S. citizens would be personally threatened with harm for talking to oversight officials or media.\nAllan Waller testified to specific examples of how KBR officials had conspired in blocking Lloyd-Owen fuel transports, and using other coercive means against its competitor. The British Lloyd-Owen has a direct contract with the Iraq government to provide fuel to various parts of the country.\nIn his introductory remarks, Dorgan explained that Senate Republicans had blocked or ignored any requests by Democrats to have a formal bipartisan hearing, resulting in the need for an independent committee."}

In addition, vice-president Dick Cheney's claim that the Iraqi insurgency was in its \"last throes\" was contradicted in Senate testimony by General John Abizaid, who said \"In terms of comparison from six months ago, in terms of foreign fighters, I believe there are more foreign fighters coming into Iraq than there were six months ago.\"\nIn his speech, Bush discussed the question of setting a timeline for withdrawal of troops, or sending more troops. \n\"Some Americans ask me, if completing the mission is so important, why don't you send more troops? If our commanders on the ground say we need more troops, I will send them. But our commanders tell me they have the number of troops they need to do their job,\" Bush said. US Commanders have previously commented on the problems caused by lack of coverage at the Syrian border.\nThe president said the war effort is a two-pronged strategy using military and political pressure to install, \"a free, representative government [in Iraq] that is an ally in the war on terror.\" The U.S. and multi-national Iraqi military coalition goal is an offensive campaign to take the fight to terrorists and insurgents in the region. The elimination of Saddam Hussien was a necessary step to build, \"institutions of a free society, a society based on freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, freedom of religion, and equal justice under law.\" Bush cited the free national elections held in January and the establishment of a Transitional National Assembly as progress on the political front, and now calls for the drafting of a constitution with the involvement of Shia, Kurds and Sunni groups.\nThe speech was received by the usually spirited troops in an atmosphere of quiet that only once interrupted his speech with polite applause near the end when Bush said: \"So we'll fight them there, we'll fight them across the world, and we will stay in the fight until the fight is won.\""}

If the debate has just been closed in a political sense, gay rights continue to create tensions between Canadians, since support for gay weddings comes mainly from Quebec and Ontario and parts of British Columbia while the and provinces are mostly against them.\nThose tensions have also been felt in the House of Commons itself, when Conservative Party leader Stephen Harper said on Monday, anticipating that the C-38 bill would be adopted, that the vote would \"lack in legitimacy\" since the bill would pass because of an unnatural alliance between the federalist Liberals and the separatist Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois. This partisan view of gay rights has been strongly condemned, especially by Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois leader who said that MPs from his party were democratically elected and as legitimate as any in parliament. Others called Harper a hypocrite, pouncing on the fact that he never raised any such objections allying with the Bloc in the previous month's confidence votes. Prior to the vote, announced his resignation from the Liberal cabinet because of his opposition to gay weddings and the fact that Liberal cabinet members were required to vote the party line in this case."}

Some invited \"citizen reporters\" from around the world extended their stay by several days to tour the country. Since the conclusion of the conference, presentations and transcripts have been published on the OhmyNews web site. \nWikinews and OhmyNews.\nThe forum sessions took place in the conference center of the COEX Convention &amp; Exhibition Center in Seoul. Interpreters provided translation services into English and Korean. Saturday began with a series of panels, each one consisting of three short presentations followed by a brief discussion with the audience. The first presentation was an introduction to Wikinews by Erik M\u00f6ller (online copy). M\u00f6ller described the history of the project and its relation to the well-known online encyclopedia Wikipedia, demonstrated a working copy of the wiki software MediaWiki, and showed some example Wikinews articles. He listed different possibilities for cooperation between Wikinews and OhmyNews, particularly content partnerships, shared communication channels and shared resource pools for citizen journalists. \"I extend the hand of friendship to OhmyNews,\" M\u00f6ller concluded.\nA brief presentation of the history of OhmyNews by Jean K. Min, Director of the International Division, followed. Min cited media reports emphasizing the growing significance of the web site in Korea, and outlined the strategy of expansion to new markets. The English edition, officially launched in May 2004, is seen as a key project in this regard, a test for the feasibility of the OhmyNews model outside Korea. Contributors to both the English and the Korean version receive a small compensation for their work, and the Korean edition uses an integrated payment system that has led to donations (\"tips\") of thousands of dollars to some OhmyNews contributors.\nIn the panel discussion that followed, one audience member asked whether, given the for-profit nature of OhmyNews and the non-profit nature of Wikinews, there might be a potential for conflict. M\u00f6ller responded that, in his view, it was the compatible philosophies of the projects that mattered, and that a for-profit endeavor did not necessarily mean that all competitors have to be destroyed. \"I don't think Oh Yeon Ho wants to be a new Rupert Murdoch,\" he said.\nGrass-roots journalism in the U.S. and \"user-created content\".\nThe first speaker of the next session was Clyde Bentley, Associate Professor for online journalism at the University of Missouri. Bentley introduced the project MyMissourian.com, which he has founded together with journalism students. As in the case of OhmyNews, editors vet stories submitted by \"citizen reporters.\" Bentley's group organized several special reporting events, such as one centering around Earth Day, a festival about environmental awareness: \"We set up a booth, and we set up some wireless computers and some other materials, and let people come in and just write about Earth Day. It was very successful.\" The most successful part of the experiment, according to Bentley, was to lend digital cameras to let people take and share photos.\nBentley argued that alternative journalism was less needed in the United States than in South Korea due to its long democratic tradition. He sees the usefulness of projects like MyMissourian.com in raising awareness of local issues and stories that might otherwise be ignored. The challenge, Bentley concluded, is to build a new \"journalism of sharing.\" Instead of being storytellers, journalists in such a scenario would be \"story guides\", assuring consistency and quality.\nThe next speaker on the panel was Jeremy Iggers, a reporter for the \"Minneapolis Star Tribune\" who did not, however, speak as a representative of his newspaper. He gave a prepared speech contrasting his early efforts promoting civic journalism with his latest endeavors in citizen journalism. \"I can trace this interest in citizen journalism back to the early 90s, when I created a public journalism project called \"Minnesota's Talking\" for the Minneapolis Star Tribune,\" Iggers said. Readers were invited to join monthly issue discussion groups in private homes, community centers, libraries, and sometimes churches. \"At the peak, we had around 100 meeting sites, with over 1,000 participants.\"\nHowever, this and similar experiments in civic journalism were cancelled, which Iggers called \"really unfortunate.\" As a revitalization of these abortive efforts online, Iggers has founded the \"Twin Cities Media Alliance\", which he wants to use to bootstrap a \"Community Newswire\" following a similar model to OhmyNews. Beyond reports by citizens, Iggers also wants to make use of stories published by local community newspapers in Minneapolis. He emphasized that this project is independent from his work for the \"Star Tribune\", and that it might be viewed as a conflict of interest.\nThe final speaker of this panel was Neil Thurman, Associate Professor at the City University London. Thurman has conducted extensive studies on how traditional media in the United Kingdom make use of \"user-generated content\" on the Internet: \"\"The Guardian\", for example, which is the most popular British news website, allows unedited and unselected comments on its pages; none of the other newspapers in the UK does.\" Thurman also argued that \"the amounts of user participation that's archived on message boards varies a great deal, you can see with the \"Daily Mail\", there's over a million posts, whereas the \"Financial Times\" has barely 10,000.\"\nOne of Thurman's key observations is that some user forums and feedback mechanisms were shut down or strongly restricted due to a perceived lack of control over the nature of the comments published in this way. Government-funded or 'public-service' efforts, Thurman observed, are generally more open to the idea of experimenting with user-created content.\nCitizen reporters in their own words.\nThe afternoon sessions focused mostly on the individual stories of OhmyNews citizen reporters from Korea and around the world. This included testimonials from:\nAdded to these and other perspectives from reporters for OhmyNews were independent views such as that of Omid Habibinia, an exiled Iranian living in Switzerland and an outspoken critic of the Iranian regime. Habibinia cited the famous case of Zahra Kazemi, an Iranian-born journalist who, many believe, was tortured and killed by Iranian officials. He criticized the extensive measures the Islamic regime had taken against press freedom: \"Just days after the revolution in 1979, Ayatollah Khomeini banned newspapers critical of the new government, beginning 26 years of terror, torture, imprisonment, exile and mass killing in Iran. In the last 25 years more than 1,000 newspapers and magazines have been banned in Iran.\" \nA different story of citizen journalism was told by Ken Takeuchi, the CEO of JanJan, a Japanese citizen journalism site functioning similarly to OhmyNews. Takeuchi argued that the OhmyNews model faced different challenges in Japan than in Korea, particularly a reluctance to express strong opinions (which Takeuchi deemed a different \"national character\" from Korea), and a widespread feeling that the existing media are doing an adequate job. Due to these and other problems, Takeuchi argued, JanJan had not yet gained a foothold in the Japanese media landscape, receiving about 2 million pageviews a month in May 2005 and publishing about 15 to 20 articles per day.\nExploring Seoul's technology sector.\nAfter the presentations on citizen journalism, Yoo Hyun-oh, President and CEO of the SK Corporation, one of the sponsors of the conference, gave a presentation on Cyworld, a very popular online community operated by SK Communications. It offers visitors a so-called \"minihompy\", a homepage which can be custom-designed using animated avatars and background music. These additions can be purchased using a currency called \"acorns.\" \nConference attendees had an opportunity to take a closer look at Cyworld in a visit to SK Communications in Seoul, including a step into the \"monitoring room\" where Cyworld staff observe the operations of the website. While SK Corporation (the \"chaebol\" to which SK Communications belongs) was one of the sponsors of the conference, international OhmyNews director Jean K. Min insisted that the technology company visits had no relationship to sponsorship.\nAnother technology company, NHN Corporation, also received a brief visit from the illustrious group of citizen reporters. NHN operates a search engine called Naver, which, according to its own data, is more popular than Google in South Korea. NHN attributes this in part to its user-created content: If the search engine does not supply an answer to a query, users are invited to write it. This model, perhaps similar to that of Wikipedia, has led to a large database of answers.\nThe International Citizen Reporters' Forum ended with a closing ceremony and Korean buffet sponsored by the \"Korea National Tourism Organization\". Conversations that began here continued into the night while intoxication increased, and several attendees extended their stay in Seoul to continue socializing and to discover Seoul and the Korean peninsula."}

One million people are now getting the drugs they need, compared to just 400,000 eighteen months ago.\nHowever, access to treatment is not growing as fast as demand, and the UN is unlikely to reach its target of treating three million people by the end of 2005 - just over half the people who need it. The longer-term target of universal treatment by 2010 is still likely to be met.\nThe figures show that the number of people receiving ART is increasing in every part of the globe, but not as quickly as people are contracting HIV. The numbers getting treatment in sub-Saharan Africa, the part of the world worst affected by HIV/AIDS has increased threefold on a year ago, and doubled in the last six months. The same rate of growth as also been seen in Asia, the second-worst affected area.\nThe WHO's report highlights that the best progress has been made when governments have worked together with the WHO, the UN and other parterners. The report goes on to make recommendations for simplifying the process to enable treatment levels to be increased even faster.\nThe UN's target was based on what was hypothetically possible if all possible steps to provide treatment were taken. The report shows the while financial, political and technical steps have been made, other areas are falling short.\nPressure groups said that countries were reacting too slowly to the pandemic and called on the G8 to provide more sustainable funding for universal treatment for Aids. \nUK international development minister Gareth Thompson said: \"We are committed to universal access to HIV treatments by 2010.

Public opinion polls show that the great majority of Indo-Fijians are opposed to the legislation, along with a large minority of indigenous Fijians. Supporters of the bill, being promoted by Prime Minister Laisenia Qarase and Attorney-General Qoriniasi Bale, argue that it will bring closure to the wounds of the 2000 coup and allow the country to move on. Opponents say that it is just a legal mechanism for releasing from prison supporters of the present government, who were convicted of coup-related offenses. For its parliamentary majority, the government relies on its coalition partner, the Conservative Alliance, several of whose senior members have been found guilty of involvement in the coup.\nOpponents of the bill include Roman Catholic Archbishop Petero Mataca, who shocked many people last week with his claims that a delegation of church leaders, representing a variety of denominations, had been misled by Prime Minister Qarase about what the bill contained. At a meeting on May 2, Mataca said, the Prime Minister had told them about its compensation provisions, but had kept them in the dark about its amnesty clauses - which they learned about only later through the media. The clergymen had supported the bill at the time, he said, because they believed in reconciliation and forgiveness. The later revelations about the amnesty provisions had come as a complete surprise to them, he said. Archbishop Mataca condemned what he said was \"a politically motivated bill\" and called on the government to withdraw it. Rev. Josateki Koroi, the former president of the Methodist Church, which claims the membership of some two-thirds of indigenous Fijians, has also expressed grave reservations about the bill, saying that reconciliation cannot be legislated and must begin with true repentance on the part of the wrongdoer - something he believes has not happened.\nPoliticians opposed to the bill include the leaders of all of the Indo-Fijian dominated parties, including former Prime Minister Mahendra Chaudhry. Indigenous politicians to have spoken out against the bill include Senator Adi Koila Nailatikau (the daughter of former President Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara, who was deposed in the coup) and her brother-in-law, Ratu Epeli Ganilau, founder of the National Alliance Party and son of former President Ratu Sir Penaia Ganilau. Ganilau, a former military commander, has called it \"an insult to the intelligence of ordinary people\" and has warned that the armed forces could use it as a legal mechanism to remove a present or future government, while Nailatikau, who was kidnapped and held as a hostage by the insurrectionists, has said that if her father were alive, he would not approve of tampering with the course of justice. \nOne of the most strident voices raised against the legislation is that of the Military commander, Commodore Frank Bainimarama. Bainimarama, who organized a counter-coup to quash the Speight rebellion in 2000, has been making press statements on almost a daily basis since the middle of May, condemning the legislation as undermining the integrity of the military and the judiciary. He has made a number of veiled statements, interpreted by some politicians as threats, about what the military might do if the bill is passed. Last week, the Fiji Times, Fiji's oldest daily newspaper, quoted an anonymous source, which it claimed was reliable, that President Ratu Josefa Iloilo (who is rumoured to be against the legislation) had refused a government request to \"discipline\" Bainimarama. Under the Constitution, the President has very little political power but is Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces.\nSupporters of the bill include former Prime Minister Sitiveni Rabuka and some traditional chiefs.\nMany Fiji citizens have been showing their support for the bill by wearing blue ribbons, or their opposition by wearing yellow ones.\nQoriniasi Bale said two days ago that unless opponents of the bill could make more constructive suggestions for improving it, parliament would most likely pass it without any changes."}

Clements indicated that it was necessary to build on that location because \"it is a unique site being the home of someone largely responsible for destroying property rights for all Americans.\" The action has given rise to a great deal of support nationwide, as many are writing to the councilors of the small town of Weare to voice their approval for the proposal.\nThe proposal for the \"Lost Liberty Hotel\", as it is to be called, features a number of components which seem to focus on the libertarian leanings of its designer. A dining room, called the \"Just Desserts Cafe\" and a museum based on the \"loss of freedom in America\" are two such components. Instead of a Bible provided by the Gideons (a standard item placed in most American hotel rooms), each guest will receive a free copy of Ayn Rand's novel Atlas Shrugged."}

The process, which is known as redenomination, started in March 2005 when Romania started dual-currency display and all prices had to be displayed in both the old leu and the new leu. Starting from today, the first notes and coins of the new leu will become legal tender, and the new leu will become the official currency of Romania.\nThe redenomination (or conversion from the old to the new leu) is simple \u2014 10,000 old lei are replaced by 1 new leu. One US dollar will buy 2.98 new lei, while one euro will buy 3.6 new lei. After the similar redenomination by Turkey the old leu had been the world's least valued currency unit, with the US dollar buying 29,891 lei and the euro buying 36,050 lei (on 30 June 2005). With the introduction of the new leu, Romania's currency will be among the most highly-valued in the region.\nThe new leu notes and coins, introduced into circulation today, will circulate alongside the old lei until 31 December 2006, when the dual-currency period ends and all of the old lei are expected to be withdrawn. However, old lei can be exchanged at banks indefinitely.\nThe new notes come into denominations of 1, 5, 10, 50, 100 and 500 new lei. The largest note of the old leu was 1,000,000 lei, or 100 new lei. The largest note of the new leu is worth 500 new lei, or approximately US$167 and \u20ac139. New leu notes will also have the same dimensions as euro notes of similar value. Additionally, they will use the same colours and design as their corresponding old leu equivalent (for example, the 100 lei note will look similar to the 1,000,000 old lei note). \nAll notes will be printed on polymer materials. Romania was the first country in Europe to introduce polymer notes, in 1999.\nRedenomination represents the symbolic end to transition.\nThe governor of the National Bank of Romania, Mugur Is\u0103rescu, said that the redenomination of the leu marks the symbolic end of Romania's economic transition from a planned economy under Communism, which was overthrown in 1989, to a free market economy. \nThe reason for redenomination was mainly the fact that the leu had become severely devalued, especially in the 1990s, due to high inflation rates. From 2002 onwards, the leu stabilised, and has even appreciated against the euro and the US dollar in the past year. Hence, the new leu was introduced to simplify the national currency, and also as a symbol of Romania's increasing economic stability. It is also expected to help pave the way for the adoption of the euro by Romania, which is expected in 2012-2014, after Romania joins the European Union in 2007.\nConcern for inflation.\nAlthough the introduction of the new leu is viewed as beneficial on the whole, since it will bring Romania's currency more in line with the value of important global currencies such as the euro and the US dollar, concerns have been raised that the new leu will fuel inflation. Some people are concerned that the new leu will result in the rounding-up of prices, similar to what happened when the euro was introduced in the Eurozone in 2002, and therefore fuel inflation. \nHowever, a rise in prices is not thought to occur due to the dual-currency display. This ensures that all businesses continue to display prices in both the new leu and the old leu until the end of 2006, and hence they will not be able to raise prices as easily, for fear of becoming less competitive in the market."}

The elections - which should have been held before last Thursday - were agreed upon as part of a peace treaty that ended a five year civil war in 2003 - a war that had seen the deaths of four million people.\nThe current President made a television address to the nation the night before the deadline appealing for calm and re-iterating his desire to see elections.\nProtest organisers say the people were just peacefully demonstrating their desire to see the interm government resign, but were attacked without provocation by security forces.

Jefferson's testimony along with new evidence supporting his testimony are putting the government of President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva in a difficult situation.\nRoberto Jefferson's testimony ran from 4 p.m. to close to 2 a.m. (local time). The deputy further explained the alleged corruption scheme involving the Brazilian Workers' Party (PT). \nThe testimony of Jefferson was at times very tense, and sometimes discussions between Jefferson and deputies of the Workers Party become heated. In one instance, a Workers' Party deputy attacked Jefferson's credibility, calling him a liar on the basis that he supported the former Brazilian President Fernando Collor de Mello, who suffered impeachment for corruption related to Treasurer Paulo Cesar Farias, who worked on Collor's campaign. Jefferson answered: \"PC Farias is a chick when you see the corruption in PT\", and accused the former governor of Rio Grande do Sul Olivio Dutra (Olivio Dutra is the minister of Lula at the present time) of involvement with the \"Jogo do Bicho\" (illegal gambling).\nAccording to Jefferson, the President of the Worker's Party Jos\u00e9 Genuino, former Minister Jos\u00e9 Dirceu, Secretary-General S\u00edlvio Pereira, and Treasurer Del\u00fabio Soares, head a widespread national corruption scheme which involves the Workers Party, members of the Government, the Brazilian Agency of Intelligence, and both government and private enterprises. Jefferson said the President was unaware of this scheme. Some members of parliament from the opposition see this claim as strange.\nDuring his last testimony, Jefferson said that entrepreneur Marcos Val\u00e9rio was responsible for finacing the payment of deputies of the alleged Votes-for-cash scandal. This week, investigations by the police showed that Marcos Val\u00e9rio withdrew, in cash, large sums of money from Rural Bank. According to Jefferson, this money was used to pay deputies. Val\u00e9rio said that he used the money to buy cattle and that farmers don't like to receive cheques, just \"real money\". His explanation was considered suspect and his former secretary said she does not know of any farms owned by Valerio.\nMarcos Val\u00e9rio is part-owner of SMPB and DNA. Documents from the Agrarian Reform Institute (INCRA) showed that Val\u00e9rio's enterprises owned 10 big farms. According to an article published by the newspaper O Estado de S\u00e3o Paulo on July 1, at least two of these farms do not exist. The Brazilian Federal Police said that there is evidence sufficient to indict Val\u00e9rio. \nThe accusations against Val\u00e9rio are tax evasion and money laundering.\nAccording to Internal Revenue Service, Marcos Val\u00e9rio's fortune was R$ 230,000 (97,676.27 USD - Live mid-market rates as of July 3, 2005, 12:47:43 UTC.) in 1997 and R$ 14,000,000 (5,945,511.97 USD) in 2004, a growth of 6086%. The enterprises of Val\u00e9rio, SMPB and DNA, have contracts with five Ministeries and eight big public enterprises, including the Post Office Service.\nBefore his testimony to the Commission, Jefferson said that Furnas, an energy company in Brazil, was involved in a corruption scheme. According to Jefferson, money from the enterprise was moved to the Workers' Party of Minas Gerais, to the treasurer Del\u00fabio Soares, to be used to buy deputies. Furnas denied this. Presidente Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva said that the allegations should be investigated. Under pressure the Furnas' directors resigned.\nOn July 2, newspapers reported that according to Brazilian Central Bank's documents, in February 17, 2004, the Workers' Party borrowed R$ 2.4 millions (1,019,230.62 USD) from Marcos Val\u00e9rio. In addition, the documents named Jos\u00e9 Geno\u00edno (the President of the Workers' Party) and Del\u00fabio Soares (the treasurer). After initially denying that the magazine had taken out this loan, the President of the Workers' Party acknowledged it to journalists on Saturday, July 2.\nDel\u00fabio Soares cried during his speech last week and said that the accusations are not true and that the \"right\" is trying to impeach President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva on false charges.\nThe testimony of Jefferson is at the center of discussions in Brazil. According to the PMDB leader, Senator Ney Suassuna, the denunciations are \"nitroglycerine which are thrown into the arteries of the Republic every minute\". Leader of the PSDB, Arthur Virg\u00edlio Neto, said that the government lives in darkness. Senator Peter Simon (PMDB-RS) appealed to President Lula to do an ethical turn-around, and respect the imperatives of morality and seriousness in government. According to Simon: \"Today society is still saying that president Lula is a man of good. However, shortly, nobody is going to say that anymore\".\nOn July 1, President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva opened the celebration of the 15th Anniversary of the Foro de S\u00e3o Paulo, in S\u00e3o Paulo. At 7:30 p.m. the forum was opened and, according to the Workers' Party, the participants expressed support for the government of President Lula. Lula spoke during the encounter with the semblance of a tired and worried man affected by the crisis.\nIt is expected that the government will began a Ministerial reformulation next week. "}

Glynn, ordered state corrections officials on Friday to produce in 30 days a written report that will outline plans to reduce over crowding and slow processing times at the city's Central Booking and Intake Center. The state-run facility is a centralized jail designed to process arrests made by all city police precincts and is the gateway into the criminal justice system of suspects taken into custody in the city of 640,000 people.\nIn the last 3 months, over 80 arrestees were released from the Central Booking facility without being formally charged. In April this year, a temporary restaining order was issued by Judge Glynn against the facility to enforce the release of those held more than 24 hours after their intake who did not receive a hearing by a court commissioner. The commissioner sets bail, if granted, and formalizes the charges filed by the arresting officer. The charges are then entered into the state's computer system where the case is tracked. The hearing also marks the date for the suspect\u2019s right to a speedy trial.\nThe Friday hearing was called after the city mayor\u2019s office of Martin O'Malley filed a motion to join a lawsuit that was brought by public defenders on behalf of those criminally detained at the facility. In Maryland, a hearing with a court commissioner within 24 hours of being arrested is state law. Judge Glynn presided over that lawsuit which led to the temporary restraining order. The order is to remain in effect until November.\nAides to O\u2019Malley are seeking help from his court to implement and then monitor procedural changes at Central Booking, and made sharp criticisms of state public safety officials. One mayor\u2019s aide said, \u201dWe continue to offer management solutions, and they are accepted. But you know what? I don\u2019t have time to run [Central Booking], nor does the police department.\u201d\nJudge Glynn expressed concern during the hearing that a purely judicial remedy may not be the answer, and said, \u201cIf I find that it is a hopeless disaster\u2026 what can I do about that?\u201d He peppered parties to the suit with questions and suggested there is the possibility that political action, not court intervention, may be needed to solve what city and police officials call inefficient management practices by the state.\nGlynn also requested parties to the suit to report back on what happened to the 80+ arrestees who were released so far as a result of the restraining order. The suspect could be re-arrested if officers knew the circumstances of the release, but police say that would take time and money to work out. An arrestee released without seeing a court commissioner has as the only record of the offense the hand written charging document by the officer.\nThe Maryland attorney general\u2019s office representing the corrections officers said at the hearing that city police are part of the problem by not filing charging documents at Central Booking when the arrestee is delivered and processing begins. The state must accept the prisoners, but cannot move forward without the necessary documents. They also say city police sometimes flood the facility, which can create temporary backlogs.\nCentral Booking was designed to process 60,000 suspects a year, but currently handles nearly 100,000. It was built to accommodate 900 people at any one time, but normally crowds in 1,200. Arrestees describe conditions in holding cells with no room to sit on the floor, and being crammed in with people who suffer with health problems or drug addicts who vomit from withdrawal."}

Bush's chief political advisor Karl Rove as one of the two sources behind the leaking of the identity of undercover CIA agent Valerie Plame, according to one or more anonymous sources cited by MSNBC. \nHowever, Rove's lawyer, Donald Luskin, acknowledged that although Rove had communicated with Cooper shortly before Plame's identity was leaked, denied any wrongdoing on the part of his client, saying that \"Rove absolutely did not identify Valerie Plame.\"\nThe notes are those of White House correspondent . They were released by Norman Pearlstine, editor-in-chief of TIME Inc., by order of the court, in ruling that, in the case of leaking the identity of CIA agents, reporters must reveal the identity of their sources.\nThe court's ruling was based on the clause in Constitutional law summarized popularly with the phrase \"Crying fire in a crowded theater\": that when the degree to which the speech puts the safety of others at risk outweighs the degree to which it benefits others, so does their right to safety and security outweigh one's right to free expression. \nThe Supreme Court on Monday refused to hear the reporters' appeal of the case.\nBackground.\n\"TIME\" magazine announced Thursday they would identify the leak from reporter Matthew Cooper's notes. The decision by \"TIME\" came after a federal judge in gave the magazine and \"The New York Times\" 48 hours to comply with a months long order to provide information on the sources of press leaks. of \"The New York Times\", along with Cooper at \"TIME\", face jail time for their refusal to name anonymous sources. The steadfast refusal by Cooper and Miller to personally identify their sources may lead to an 18 month jail sentence.\nThe case against Cooper stemmed from a July 6, 2003 Op-Ed piece published by the \"Times\", where disputed the assertion made by President Bush in his that Saddam Hussein tried to buy uranium from Niger.\nA week later Valerie Plame, Wilson's wife, was identified as a CIA operative in a news story written by , a conservative pundit. The news blew Plame's cover, and the information was obtained by two anonymous White House sources. The leak to the press was thought by some to be retaliation for her husband's Op-Ed story. Wilson blamed Rove for the leak, saying in an Aug. 21, 2003 public panel, \"At the end of the day, it's of keen interest to me to see whether or not we can get Karl Rove frog-marched out of the White House in handcuffs. And trust me, when I use that name, I measure my words.\" \nCooper wrote and had published stories about the issue at \"TIME\". Miller did research, but did not write a story. The reporter Novak who broke the story, remained silent on the case until Wednesday, and said on \"CNN\"'s \"Inside Politics\" that, \"They're not going to jail because of me.\"\nJournalists usually protect their sources' wishes of anonymity, in order to retain a vital channel of information from and others with controversial information. The tension between the press and the U.S. Federal judiciary highlights what Rick Rodriquez, executive director of the American Association of Newspaper Editors, calls \"the need to have a discussion around the federal shield law.\" A \"shield\" could grant confidentiality between reporters and anonymous sources similarly to the right granted in .\nThe decision by his employer \"TIME\" to reveal a source may spare veteran reporter Cooper time behind bars. His employer is in possession of his notes and therefore has knowledge of the source. In the case of Miller, \"The New York Times\" claims it has no such reporting notes."}

Truex Jr. lead for most of the race, first taking the lead position at lap 21.\nFour fighter jets from the Connecticut Air National Guard flew over the track after the national anthem, a NASCAR tradition for races.\nThe race got off to a rocky start for some, such as the #64 car driven by Jeremy Mayfield pit early twice, once on lap four and another one lap after. On lap 13, the #60 car driven by Carl Edwards spun through the grass near Turns 1 and 2 after being hit by Truex Jr, sending the race into a caution.\nTruex Jr. fought for the lead on lap 21 with his car owner Dale Earnhardt Jr., where Truex passed Earnhardt on the high end of Turn 4. Earnhardt would later slip back to the third position two laps later.\nLap 37 started with a smoking run into the pits by Kyle Krisiloff and his #5 car after a break malfunction, which led to him exceeding the speed limit placed by NASCAR on pit road. Seven laps later, JJ Yaley's #18 car stalled on the track and coasted into the garage.\nNextel cup veteran driver Sterling Marlin's front right tire gave out on lap 56, sending the race into yet another caution for the night. The race was then silent until lap 78, when Earnhardt came into contact with driver Paul Menard of the #11 car coming off turn 4, causing Earnhardt to spin. Earnhardt did not return to the race after the incident, believed to be the cause of a broken transmission from the spin. A caution was issued.\nIt would be 10 laps until another caution would be issued, this time for the rookie Michel Jourdain Jr. in his #10 car, after he spins after coming in contact with two other cars. After the caution, a three-car leadership of Greg Biffle, Kevin Harvick and Truex Jr. would lead the remainder of the race, with each of them taking a turn leading.\nA major crash caused by #34, driven by Randy LaJoie, resulted in an 8-car pileup along the backstretch on lap 97, sending the race into its final caution of the night. A red flag was issued on lap 99, freezing the field of any movement or alterations with the cars. The race finally resumed almost 20 minutes later, with a green-white-checkered finish led by Truex Jr."}

The collision took place at 5:45 UTC and NASA held a press briefing shortly after at the (JPL) in , , NASA's non-manned space flight control center. A full-fledged press conference by NASA is scheduled to be at JPL on Monday afternoon at 2 p.m. PDT (9:00 UTC).\nThe experiment, intending to provide more information about the make up of comets, consisted of a 370\u00a0kg projectile being fired at the comet in order to observe and analyse the resultant impact. With information gleaned from the impact, the comet's general make-up can be established and more accurate hypotheses regarding how the Solar system and the universe came to be.\nBackground.\nDeep Impact is a NASA space probe designed to study the composition of the interior of a comet. Previous space missions to comets, such as Giotto and Stardust, were merely fly-by missions, only able to photograph and examine the surfaces of cometary nuclei. The Deep Impact mission will be the first to examine a cometary interior, and thus, scientists hope, reveal new secrets about these small frozen bodies.\nMission profile.\nFollowing its launch on January 12, 2005, the \"Deep Impact\" spacecraft took 174 days to reach Comet Tempel 1 at a cruising speed of 103,000 kilometers per hour (64,000 miles per hour). Once the spacecraft reached the vicinity of the comet on July 3, 2005, it separated into two portions, an impactor and a flyby probe.

In addition, the impact was observed by cameras and spectroscopes on board Europe's spacecraft, which was about 80 million km from the comet at the time of impact.

The report, issued June 30, shows in 2004 San Jose, with an estimated population of 904,522 is the nation's 10th-largest city, overtaking with its smaller population of 900,198.\nThe U.S. Census traditionally releases population figures for the year previous to the date the figures are made public.\n'Capital of Silicon Valley' still an unknown among Americans.\nAccording to a report in the \"\", Mayor is saying the new ranking may help people across the U.S. be more interested in San Jose and think of it as a world-class city. \"It puts us in a very distinguished class,\" he told the paper.\nBut for many, northern California's largest city, the self-proclaimed \"Capital of \" remains an enigma. In a country not noted for its geographical knowledge prowess, many Americans have no idea where San Jose actually is. Culturally, the city may be best known as the title location of a hit song with the ironic title, \"Do You Know the Way to San Jose?\"\nMany locals claim the city suffers from a self esteem problem stretching back to 1852 when San Jose lost the honor of being the California state capital to . Additionally, for most of its existence, San Jose has been overshadowed by its smaller and more glamorous neighbor to the north, . \n\"San Francisco has been in the limelight since 1849, and it was the capital of everything west of \u2014 it was a huge presence in the psyche of the world, and we can never replace that,\" David Vossbrink, San Jose city spokesman, told the \"\". \nIt doesn't stop with San Francisco; San Jose is routinely outshined by other Bay Area cities such as , California, which is one-third its size. Additionally, the city's own Silicon Valley suburbs, including and , regularly steal the national spotlight from San Jose.\nAs far as the workkforce is concerned, San Jose continues to reel from the dot-com meltdown of the early 2000s. With an unemployment rate of 5.5 percent, it has a higher jobless rate than the national average of 5.1 percent. For a couple of years after the 2000 tech crash, San Jose lost population as thousands of unemployed fled to look for work elsewhere.\nBut the city is on the mend and does have some legitimate bragging rights aside from sheer size. Despite the unemployment, San Jose is America's wealthiest big city with an average household annual income of $70,000. It consistently ranks as \"The Safest Big City in America,\" according to FBI crime statistics as having the lowest violent crime rate for any U.S. city with a population over 500,000. The local public university, is the largest within the system.\nEconomically, an increasing number of large companies also are opting to call San Jose home, including , , and .\nSlowdown in 'Motown' a long time coming.\nFor many media outlets covering San Jose's ascendence into the ranks of the United States' Top 10 cities, the real story has been the decline of Detroit and its symbol as a Midwestern industrial giant.\nFor decades, Detroit, the self-styled \"Motor City,\" rested its fortunes with the American automobile industry. Each of the automobile manufacturers, , , and , maintained headquarters there.\nBut with the shift of the U.S. economy away from heavy industry to services and technology, cities like Detroit suffered, while cities like San Jose prospered. \nDetroit's decline in population is not a new phenomenon. In the 1950s, the city had a population of about 1.8 million, ranking as the fourth-largest U.S. city. But its fortunes started changing in the 1970s with the oil embargo and the rise of Japan as an automobile-producing powerhouse. As the city's fortunes waned, many residents fled Detroit for the suburbs or opted to leave Michigan altogether.\n\"It's part of a pattern for the heavily industrialized cities, but I think Detroit is a specific case. There's been an ongoing dynamic here of people, middle-class people in Detroit, fleeing the city looking for better schools, better lifestyles, better services. So it has been a particularly hard fall,\" Dana Johnson, chief economist at Comerica Bank in Detroit said in an interview with the \"New York Times\".\nDetroit has also been taking its knocks in recent statistics. Unlike San Jose's reputation for being a safe place to live, Detroit tops the list of most violent U.S. big cities. In the past year, \"\" named Detroit Mayor among the worst mayors in the U.S.\nAlong with the exodus of people and 7.8 percent unemployment rate, Detroit harbors a sight unseen in San Jose, blocks of vacant housing. For years these vacant buildings have been the targets of arsonists on the so-called , where blocks of homes have been set ablaze in Detroit.\nAdditionally, unlike San Jose, which is in the process of moving 1,800 employees into a new $388 million city hall and faces shortage of police officers, shrinking Detroit faces a $300 million budget deficit and the prospect of laying off 700 police and fire-fighting personnel in the next few months.

Senator Allen, who according to the \"Richmond Times-Dispatch\" has presidential aspirations in the 2008 election, said of the bill\u2019s introduction that it would, \u201cgive the law abiding citizens of the capital their constitutional right to protect themselves again.\u201d It currently has 32 Senate co-sponsors, and sponsorship of the bill is expected to climb to 50 in the 100-member chamber before debate on the bill's passage begins.\nPassage of the Senate bill would overturn the city law that has support from the mayor, city council, police chief and many of its citizens.

Weather forecasters were calling for up to 10 inches of rain, lightning and the possibility of tornadoes to be spawned by the storm.\nCindy is expected to weaken after making landfall and is not expected to develop into a full-fledged hurricane since it is too close to the shore and will be robbed of warm ocean waters essential for a tropical storm's growth. A true hurricane is defined as a tropical storm with sustained wind speeds of 74 miles per hour or greater.\nCindy wasn't alone in U.S. hurricane weather news Tuesday. Another tropical storm, named Dennis, formed in the warm shallow waters of the Caribbean off the coast of Jamaica. Dennis is expected to pass into the Gulf of Mexico and develop into a hurricane as it strengthens over the gulf waters.\nOil companies which have crude oil pumping rigs which resemble man-made islands in the Gulf of Mexico are busy evacuating to take workers to safety as Dennis approaches.\nThe U.S. hurricane season lasts from June 1 to Nov. 30.

The former Hutu rebel group CNDD-FDD, now a multi-ethnic party, won a convincing victory with 58% of the vote. Frodebu polled just 22%. \nIt was the first national democratic vote since 1993, when a military coup plunged Burundi into a decade-long, ethnically-charged civil war. During the election campaign, CNDD-FDD accused Frodebu of stirring up racial divisions, and of employing members of the Hutu-extremist FNL to kill and intimidate voters. The FNL rebels have remained outside the Burundian peace process, despite the restoration of democracy, and a series of heavy defeats by the Burundian army. On June 16th attackers believed to be members of the FNL massacred six churchgoers in the Muhuta district of Rural Bujumbura. During earlier local elections, the FNL had attacked a polling station, killing a United Nations peacekeeper, and killed several people in \"hit and run\" attacks on the Burundian capital Bujumbura. Frodebu denied involvement in the violence, but have recently admitted \"political collaboration\" with the FNL.\nwww.abarundi.org reports that the Tanzanian government has offered material support to the FNL leader and helped formalise the \"unholy alliance\" between Frodebu and the FNL:\n\"With the assistance of the Tanzanians, [FNL leader] Agathon Rwasa has moved his HQ from the hills around Bujumbura, where he was already in difficulty, to the Tanzanian capital Dar Es Salaam, where he can enjoy the protection of the Tanzanian secret service.\"\n\"Rwasa, who has nothing more to lose, has accepted that the success of the elections mean political death for the FNL, and their position as 'Hutu defenders' has become obsolete.\"\n\"But if Rwasa's strategy is merely his own survival, Frodebu's calculation is far more diabolical - they intend to perpetuate Burundi's bloody civil war and state of insecurity, in order to undermine the new institutions.\" "}

The Metropolitan Police Service has initially confirmed that 33 people have been killed in the four explosions on London's transport system this morning, and said the overall number of wounded was as high as 700, in what are believed to be terrorist attacks. (See later reports in the box at the side for later announcements made on following days.) \nThe first reports were of an explosion at 08:49 BST (UTC+1) on the Hammersmith &amp; City Line between Liverpool Street station and Aldgate East. Explosions also occurred on a train between King's Cross and Russell Square and another at Edgware Road. The explosions are currently being reported, and described by Prime Minister Tony Blair, as being \"terrorist attacks.\" Traces of explosives were found at two of the sites according to the BBC.\nScotland Yard has confirmed one explosion onboard a double decker red London bus travelling south outside the on . Police cannot confirm whether this bomb was intended for another train and accidentally detonated aboard the bus instead.\nPundits are speculating the attack was co-ordinated by al-Qaeda. Dr. Shane Brighton, an intelligence expert at the Royal United Services Institute for Defence, claims that, \"If what we are looking at is a simultaneous bombing \u2014 and it does look like that \u2014 it would very certainly fit the classic al Qaeda methodology.\" Two militant Islamist groups are reported to have claimed responsibility for the blasts.\nCasualties.\nIn a special news conference at 15:30 BST, July 7, Deputy Assistant Commissioner Brian Paddick of the Metropolitan Police confirmed 33 fatalities so far, 45 critical/serious injuries and approximately 300 minor injuries. \nAt 08:51 BST a bomb exploded on a Circle Line Underground train 91 metres/100 yards into the tunnel from Liverpool Street. Seven are known to be dead.\nAt 08:56 BST a bomb detonated on a Piccadilly Line train between King's Cross and Russell Square. Twenty-one are dead; it is believed more bodies remain in the tunnel, which is one of the deepest on the Underground network.\nAt 09:17 BST a bomb exploded on another Circle Line train between Edgware Road Station and Paddington. The blast blew a hole in a wall, and another train was hit by debris from it. A third train is also involved. Five are known to be dead.\nAt 09:47 BST a No. 30 bus (Hackney - Marble Arch) blew up at the junction between Tavistock Square and Woburn Place outside the BMA building. It has been estimated that thirteen people died.\nEarlier, quoting the Associated Press, Yahoo News had reported \"at least 40 people were killed and more than 350 wounded\". Also, the same report says \"two U.S. law enforcement officials said at least 40 people were killed\".\nHotlines.\nSeveral hotlines have been set up for those concerned about friends or relatives. A list of these numbers are below. The agencies setting up these hotlines stress that callers should try to reach their friends or relatives first before contacting the hotline. In addition, to prevent swamping, they also have asked that only genuine callers use the hotlines.\nReports.\nThe first reports that came in were from London's Liverpool Street station talking of an explosion on the Metropolitan Underground line and the station being evacuated. Later a BBC and a Wikinews reporter spoke of a bus being destroyed by a bomb blast in Tavistock Square outside the British Medical Association offices. \nThe initial reports of explosions were believed to have been the result of power surges. This was because the first indication of any disturbance was the opening of circuit breakers in the Underground, which was observed in the control room. This is usually due to a power surge, but in this case the actual cause was damage to the track circuits by bombs.\nAt approximately 10:50 BST reports were made that there was an additional, as yet unidentified explosion along Houndsditch, near Liverpool Street Station. Police were also warning pedestrians at Russell Square that a series of controlled explosions would be made shortly.\nBBC News 24 has reported additional unspecified incidents at Brighton, Luton, and Swindon. These stations have been closed and there has been no official confirmation of the nature of the incidents, if any actually occurred.\nThe Metropolitan Police Commissioner, Sir Ian Blair told London Live that there have been \"events\" at Edgware Road, Kings Cross, Liverpool Street, Russell Square, Aldgate East and Moorgate.\nAt 11:30 BST (UTC+1) St. Mary's Hospital released a statement that they have admitted 4 critical, 8 severe and several minor injures. Injuries are limb damage, cuts, burns, head injuries and chest problems.\nThe exact causes of the explosions are still unknown. Initially, it was thought that it was some technical fault. However, the police later suspected terrorist attacks. Police are still unsure if the bombs were simply left in packages or whether there were some sort of suicide attacks.\nAccording to the Associated Press, a senior Israeli official said Scotland Yard told Israel minutes before the explosions that it had received warnings of possible \"terror attacks\". Sky News says this has been denied by Scotland Yard. Sir Ian during his interview with Sky stated that there had been no specific intelligence. \nGerman news magazine \"Der Spiegel\" (as well as unconfirmed information from CIA) has reported that a letter from an organization calling itself \"Secret organization - Al Qaeda in Europe\" has appeared, claiming responsibility for the bombings. See our related story for more details.\nA broadcast interruption on \"MTV\" Thursday at 16:00 UTC said a group naming itself \"Al Jihad Network in Europe\" claimed responsibility for the bombings. \nA police spokeswoman has confirmed two deaths at Aldgate station. Television and radio reports are now saying there have been four separate incidents with up to 150 casualties, speculating that the blasts may be related to terrorist activity.\nThe Associated Press is reporting that a US law enforcement official has put the toll at 40 killed.\nEmergency Services press conference at around 15:15 BST (UTC+1) confirms at least 33 fatalities, not including those resulting from the incident on the number 30 bus.\nThe CBC reports at least 52 fatalities, including 17 from the incident on the number 30 bus according to media reports.\nIt has been reported that in the early stages of the attack, information was only distributed to civilians within the center of London, and authorities had a specific policy of not providing information to the global media, in case any information provided to the media could be used by additional terrorists to target vulnerable locations during an evacuation procedure. This was probably partly to blame for the early confusion amongst the media.\nEffects of the incidents and responses from the emergency services.\nEmergency services are also attending King's Cross and Liverpool Street Station.\nThe entire tube network and all buses within zone 1 have been suspended and many buses are now being used to ferry the 'walking wounded' to the hospitals. The underground will be closed for an indefinite period of time, but according to Fox News Channel United States, the closure will last at least for all of today.\nAll emergency services are responding en-masse to a \"major incident\" and are responding only to life-threatening emergency calls. Patients are being turned away at hospitals to free room for those injured by the attacks. \nThe London Congestion Charge has been suspended for the 7th and 8th of July.\nThe Jerusalem Post reports that the Army was dispatched to seal off the Israeli Embassy as Israel's Finance Minister is present for a conference. The army have reportedly been involved with rescues at . Police have denied this report (originally made on Sky News). \nThe police have cordoned off roads around Upper Woburn Place following a massive explosion on a bus in the vicinity. Traffic is at a standstill in many places in the capital. Defra's security branch are reporting that police are advising everyone in London not to use any public transport and the Cabinet Office are advising staff to remain in offices until further notice. A further email sent to all staff by Defra's permanent secretary indicates that Charing Cross and Waterloo mainline railway stations have been closed down for police searches, and that other stations could close for similar reasons later today.\nAs at 09.30 BST, Kings Cross Thameslink was experiencing delays and overcrowding but no serious difficulties.\nBusinesses have been hit by the uncertainty of the events \u2013 the FTSE had fallen almost 3.5% by 11.47UTC (), but started to recover a little by early afternoon. The value of the pound has dipped, and the London crude oil price has dropped. International markets are also suffering, with falls in share indexes felt as far as South Africa. See our related story for more details.\nAccording to Fox News Channel United States, all London schools are in lockdown and students are being kept in schools.\nThe Authorities are asking people in London to stay where they are, indoors if possible. Take inside any bins or bags of rubbish they have left out for collection, providing they check their contents first. Arrangements are also being made for when schools finish as schools have been asked to keep pupils safe inside until the usual school closing time.\nThe UK Highways Agency has stated that at the request of the police, the message \"Avoid London - Turn on Radio\" is being displayed on electronic motorway message signs on the M25 and other major routes approaching London.\nThe US Homeland Security Department asked authorities in major cities for heightened vigilance of major transportation systems. Department spokesman Roehrkasse indicated that the department had not received any indications of plans that this type of attack is planned in the United States. Later, the department raised the terror alert level to orange. See our related story for more details.\nOfficial responses.\nA joint statement of the G8 leaders was made by Tony Blair at a press conference, also attended by US President George Bush and Russian President Vladimir Putin.

To do so under circumstances that connote an Edsa 3 (the third people's revolution) would condemn any successor to the possibility of an Edsa 4, then an Edsa 5, and so on and so on, unless our political system were first reformed to make it more responsive to the people's will, such that changes in leadership come about in an orderly and stable manner...\"\nArroyo said that the time had come to face the fact that the political system had degenerated so much that partisan agenda is coming before national interest.\nShe pointed to the huge emigration from the country as an indication of the large problems within, while endless scandals and conflict seem to plague the southeast Asian nation.\nThe President ended her address by promising to bring a resolution to all that has plagued the country."}

This came after finding out about hidden sex scenes in the popular video game \"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\".\nThe game also has been criticised as being too violent. This is not limited to \"San Andreas\": the entire series has come under fire for its content, mostly the last two games, \"Grand Theft Auto 3\" and \"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City\".\nThe sex scenes come in the form of a \"mini-game\" in which the player controls the male with the task of maximising his cohort's \"excitment.\" The hidden game in GTA: San Andreas is not advertised or easy to find but can be unlocked by modifying the game using a program which has been widely available on the Internet for weeks. But for NIMF and the Entertainment Software Ratings Board (ESRB), the organization which rates video games and rated GTA: San Andreas 'M' for Mature, the hidden mini-game came as a surprise. As such, the ESRB has launched an investigation into the matter.\nTo unlock the hidden sex mini-game on the Playstation 2 requires an Action Replay or Gameshark. These devices cannot transfer new content to a console but can enable content already contained on the game disc. The presence of this minigame on an unmodified retail version implies that it was created by the game's creators rather than hackers or the mod community.\nRockstar Games, the game's publisher, refused to comment on whether the sex scenes were inserted by their programmers. Rockstar Games has also said, \"We thoroughly support the work of the ESRB, and believe that it has an exemplary record of rating games and promoting understanding of video game content. We also feel confident that the investigation will uphold the original rating of the game, as the work of the mod community is beyond the scope of either publishers or the ESRB.\"\nIn the game the character may have girlfriends, and at a certain point in his stats he can entertain his girlfriend with some \"coffee\". However, the \"hot coffee\" modification unlocks the secret sex scenes after the two share a drink.\nThe sex scene portrays oral sex and coitus, but genitals are not shown.

The deal, which is yet to be approved by the University's Board of Governors, could result in students starting classes in the building as early as September 2006.\nThe building has been a huge vacancy in the downtown core, with only the broadcasting corporation CHUM Limited using any space. University of Alberta President Indira Samarasekera has said there are no plans to ask the company, which owns 91.7 The Bounce and A-Channel to move.\nThe deal would also solve the University's space crunch. The total University population is growing much faster than the number of facilities required to support it, so expanding beyond the current campus makes sense. Establishing a presence downtown will also help the University and it's many spin off companies.\nThe University has not yet decided how the project would be funded, but is currently looking at a number of options, including partnerships with all three levels of government.\nImages.\nMore images are available in this Flickr photoset."}

Both police and protestors charge the other side with violence. \nAt least one police officer was rushed to a nearby hospital with head wounds. Other injuries have yet to be reported. The California city, widely considered a progressive bastion in the U.S., has since 2003 allowed impromptu, unlicensed rallies and protests where police are trained not to interfere with protestors unless public safety is threatened.\nThe protesters began their rally at 7:47 p.m. at the corner of 16th and Mission streets in San Francisco near the Wells Fargo bank. Reportedly, in less than an hour 150 people had gathered at the corner. \nBy 8:51 p.m., more than 200 people began to move down the street towards 23rd and Mission streets through the heart of San Francisco's Latino enclave. Since the protestors failed to notify the city of their march and failed to get a permit, police told the marchers that the street march was illegal, asking the protesters to move to the sidewalk. \nThey began to move up 24th towards Valencia, where the first arrest was made of a protestor setting off illegal fireworks. Protesters who didn't know the specifics, heard of the arrest and started to step off of the sidewalk and run to avoid police. At 9:14 p.m. organizers called for a regroup at 16th and Mission. \nMost people went to regroup, though some stayed behind. Windows were broken at Wells Fargo, Bank of America, and KFC restaurant as well as other corporate targets, labeled as symbols of global capitalism. \nAmerican flag burnings re-energized the group and trash cans were lit on fire. Protestors then moved newspaper stands into the street to create barricades against police cars. \nLater, a police car was believed to have been set on fire due to a collision with a protester's sign. It turned out that it had only been a red smoke bomb. But the officer was beaten by protestors. The protest dispersed by 11:23 p.m. after an ambulance arrived to take the police officer to a nearby hospital. \nOrganizers of the protest reportedly claimed theirs was not just an anti-G8 protest, though they were the main target. A group calling itself \"Anarchist Action\" said that the protest was also march against capitalism and gentrification in San Francisco. "}

The blast tripped out the power system, visible in the control room. The first call the police received that morning reported \"a bang\" at Aldgate East, coming within a minute of the blast.\nThe Edgware Road train, leaving for Paddington and also on the Circle, exploded opposite a train coming from the other direction, making people think at first that it was a derailment. The first call to the Police spoke not of an explosion, but of a person falling under the wheels of the train. The confirmation of a bomb did not come until 9.17am, but by that time the emergency services were already on scene.\nTransport for London's new \"TrackerNet\" software is fully opertational on the Circle line, which allows for precise tracking of trains, but is not yet fully installed on the Piccadilly line. The first indication of the Piccadilly line bomb was when the tunnel telephone system wires were cut by the blast, an event logged by other software. The cutting of the lines then tripped out the track current. The tunnel itself suffered only slight damage and is safe, but the train - which was packed with commuters heading for Russell Square - is very badly damaged.\nLondon Underground declared a 'code Amber' within minutes, moving trains to platforms and opening all doors. A 'code Red' - full evacuation - was set at around 9.15am. O'Toole described the decision to evacuate as being \"very grave, not taken lightly\". When questioned as to whether everything possible had been done on the day to save lives, the managing director of Transport for London was \"very proud\" of the choices made that morning.\nAs investigations continue, all bodies have been removed from the sub-surface Circle line trains, but the carriages themselves are still in situ while a painstaking forensic investigation takes place.\nCurrently, work is on-going to retrieve bodies and forensic evidence from the carriage of the train in the deep tunnel of the Piccadilly line near King's Cross. Teams of rescue workers looking for human remains are working alongside forensics experts in a \"meticulous\" search to find evidence.\nConditions are described as being very difficult, with high temperatures and lots of dust. Work was halted over Friday night when conditions became too bad, and resumed this morning. Efforts have been made to improve the ventilation.\nWork will continue throughout tonight and possibly into Sunday. The exact number of bodies still in the wrecked carriage is unknown.\nAccess from King's Cross is impossible, so workers are taking the longer route from Russell Square station to get to the front of the train.\nPolice have revealed that the bombs were 'high explosives' - not homemade. However they are declining to be specific about their composition as the information could be useful when they interrogate suspects.\nPolice will not confirm or deny if any parts of a timer have been found, but have said that \"any device will now be in a million pieces\". Police believe the use of timers more likely than suicide bombings as the blasts were so closely timed, but are not ruling out anything."}

It is expected to be the last official national commemoration in the United Kingdom to mark the end of WWII.\nAfter consulting veterans groups, the British Government chose to hold the national day of commemorations on 10 July, instead of separate days for VE Day (8 May) and VJ Day (15 August).\nThe day began with a service at Westminster Abbey at 11:00 BST, led by Queen Elizabeth II and attended by Prime Minister Tony Blair, Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams and hundreds of World War II veterans. The terrorist attacks in London on 7 July were also mentioned during the service, drawing parallels between the resilience of Londoners during the Blitz in WWII. A lunch was later held by the Queen at Buckingham Palace for WWII veterans of the Armed Forces and Home Front. \nThe Queen later led the parade down The Mall in a carriage, escorted by the Household Cavalry. A \"Reflections of World War II Commemoration Show\" began at 15:00 on Horse Guards Parade, attended by the Royal Family, politicians, veterans and others. The show was designed to portray a variety of experiences of World War II, including speeches, such as Prime Minister Winston Churchill's \"We shall fight on the beaches...\", and popular songs of the time, all of which were performed by current entertainers, including actor Robert Hardy, who portrayed Winston Churchill. The Queen made an address during the show, expressing her admiration for veterans of WWII while also drawing on the recent attacks on London. \nThe guns of the light cruiser HMS Belfast, which saw service in WWII, signalled the beginning of a two-minute silence at 15:45 pm, which ended again with the firing of Belfast's guns. Buglers of the Indian Army performed the Last Post.\nA \"Parade of Standards\", numbering over a hundred, began to march down The Mall to Buckingham Palace at 16:15, led by the Queen in an open-top car. Large crowds began to converge on the palace, with the Royal Family later appearing on the palace's balcony, evoking memories of the VE Day celebrations on 8 May 1945. A flypast of WWII-era aircraft took place at 17:00, including a Lancaster bomber, flanked by a Hawker Hurricane and Supermarine Spitfire, which released a million poppies.\nIn New Zealand, Prince William of Wales, who is visiting New Zealand for his first official royal duties abroad, laid a wreath at the Auckland Cenotaph to commemorate the end of World War II. New Zealand Prime Minister Helen Clark and Governor-General Dame Silvia Cartwright also attended. "}

The survey received responses from 500 county law enforcement agencies in 45 states. 58 percent of counties in the survey said that methamphetamine was their largest drug problem followed by cocaine (19%), marijuana (17%) and heroin (3%) as the most problematic drug for each county. \nMethamphetamine is a growing problem, nearly double what it was three years ago in many regions. Over the last three years, 88 percent of counties have experienced an increase of meth-related crimes. Regions reporting the largest growth include the Upper Midwest, Southwest, and the Northwest - all reported a 93 percent increase in meth-related arrests. The Lower Midwest came in a close second with arrests increasing by 90 percent. \nMeth labs use highly flammable and explosive materials to produce the drug. Due to this, meth labs have been known to explode in spectacularly devastating events. The waste produced in the process of making methamphetamine is disposed of using improper methods, leaving significant amounts of toxic waste in streams, groundwater, and septic systems.\nThe report contains numerous inaccuracies. Notably it states that \"In the past 70 years, a new group of drugs have appeared on the horizon. These are not drugs like heroin, marijuana, and cocaine, but rather the synthetic drugs that use amphetamines as a primary ingredient in their manufacture. Known collectively as methamphetamine, they have been nicknamed meth, crank, crystal, speed and many other local or regional variations.\"\nAmphetamine was first synthesized in 1887, dating the appearance of amphetamines to almost 120 years ago, not 70 as stated in the report. The drugs themselves are known collectively as \"amphetamines\" not as \"methamphetamine\" which is only one specific compound, not a group of compounds. Other amphetamines include Dexedrine, MDMA (Ecstacy), MDA, and MDE. Amphetamine itself has been prescribed to millions of children and adults alike to treat ADD/ADHD. Dexedrine has been used by the Air Force to keep pilots alert during long missions. \nIn another error of fact the report states that \"in 1965 the federal food and drug laws were amended to try to decrease the black market sales of amphetamines\" - Amphetamine products were first curbed in 1959 when Benzedrine was removed from store shelves by the FDA. It is possible that the authors thought that the Comprehensive Methamphetamine Control Act of 1996 was a 1965 bill because its designator was \"Bill Number S.1965\"."}

Kerry spoke clearly for the removal of Rove, and reporters who noted Clinton's nods in agreement with Kerry queried her. She replied in support of Kerry's comments, \"I agree with that.\" \nThe White House refused to comment Monday on Karl Rove's involvement in the leak of the name of the covert CIA agent Valerie Plame.

Her husband, a former ambassador under the first president Bush, Joseph Wilson has been proven correct in his assertions that Iraq was not attempting to gain or purchased uranium from Niger. \nWhite House Press Secretary Scott McClellan refused to comment on a series of questions which increased in intensity quickly during a July 11 White House Press Briefing.

Because, contrary to what you told the American people, he did, indeed, talk about his wife, didn't he? \nMR.

It comes after a report was leaked to the Mail on Sunday in the aftermath of the 7 July London bombings. \nThe document (Options for Future UK Force Posture in Iraq) was marked \"Secret - UK eyes only\" and also contained information on possible U.S. troop reductions, bringing the number of Coalition forces in Iraq down to 66,000. About 176,000 Coalition troops are presently in Iraq, 130,000 of which are from the United States Armed Forces. However, the document also reveals there is division between the Pentagon, which apparently favours a \"relatively bold reduction\", and U.S. commanders in Iraq who are more cautious. \nThe British Army is the lead component of the Multi-National Division (South-East). It has maintained forces in the 8,000+ region since the end of the 2003 Iraq War. In the document, Mr Reid admitted that a large reduction of British and U.S. forces would make it difficult for other countries to keep their force in Iraq. \nMr Reid, who took up the position of Secretary of State for Defence on 6 May 2005, admitted that the document was made by him for Prime Minister Tony Blair. In the document, Mr Reid stated that a decision would need to be made later this year on British forces levels in Iraq. The possible transfer of control of Al Muthanna and Maysan provinces, followed by Al Basrah and Dhi Qar provinces in 2006, were also included in the document. It estimated the reduction of British forces could save about \u00a31 billion pounds (about $1.7 billion U.S. dollars).\nIn a statement on 10 July made in response to the leaking of the document, Mr Reid denied that the document signalled any change in policy, stating that, \"No decisions on the future force posture of UK forces have been taken. But we have always said that it is our intention to hand over the lead in fighting terrorists to Iraqi security forces as their capability increases. We therefore continually produce papers outlining possible options and contingencies.\"\nOn 4 July, during a debate in the House of Commons, Mr Reid had hinted at possible reductions in forces, saying that, \"By and large, about 12 [of 18] of the provinces are relatively free of terrorist attacks. As the Iraqi forces become trained to take the lead, it is possible, over a period of time, to hand the lead role to Iraqi forces in certain areas of the country and gradually, we hope, over the whole country.\"\nA spokesperson of the MND (SE) was questioned by a Wikireporter. When asked whether speculation of reductions would affect British forces morale in Iraq, it was insisted that, \"The British forces will continue to operate in the professional manner to which they always have done.\" \nThe spokesperson added, \"No decision on the future posture of UK forces in Iraq has been taken. There has been no change in policy. Assisting the Iraqis to improve the security environment remains our top priority.\"\nSpeaking of the response by Iraqis to the London bombings, the spokesperson said, \"Most of the feed back from Friday pray[ers] in the British Area of Operation were against the attacks on London.\" "}

The launch was already facing the threat of a scrub due to thunderstorms in the area.\nThe sensor is one of four used to trigger the engine cutout after launch. Although only two are required for normal operation, and the Shuttle can be flown with one, NASA elected to maintain full redundancy. Should more of the sensors fail, the engine might burn out due to lack of fuel, a situation that has not been tested.\nThe problem was detected during a simulation of an empty tank. When placed in a mode simulating an empty tank, three of the sensors correctly registered that the tank was empty, while the faulty sensor stayed in the \"full\" state. NASA is currently unsure whether the problem relates to the sensor, the instrumentation circuits reporting the sensor's state, or the simulation circuits.\nThe problem comes after a separate incident yesterday when a cockpit window cover fell from the Orbiter, damaging thermal protection tiles. A similar problem caused the replacement of the fuel tank in June. NASA described the problem as an \"intermittent fault\".\nThe launch, which was scheduled for 3:51 ET (20:51 UTC), would have been the first launch of a shuttle since \"Columbia\"'s February 2003 crash which killed all crew members aboard.\nIt is still unknown to NASA officials what caused the sensor to become defective.

He called \u201creprehensible\u201d the alleged actions of the Martinez couple. \nCourt documents for the case record that Lopez, who worked as a construction worker, would collect the ID fee from other illegal Bolivians, and keep $500 for himself. He would then steer the person to the service center where Mr. Martinez worked. Martinez, a longtime employee and 4-year supervisor, would often fill out the immigrant\u2019s application, and falsely certify that an ID from another state was surrendered.\nLopez became involved with the Martinez\u2019s when his own driving privileges had been suspended. He met Miriam, who arranged to have a new ID issued to him, through her husband. A working relationship developed between the two, and Miriam would call Lopez and tell him when to appear at the DMV service center with clients who followed behind him in the scheme. The arrest of Lopez was unknown to Miriam when he made a monitored call to her and said he had 2 cousins from Bolivia. This ultimately led to undercover agents, who posed as the cousins, being issued ID\u2019s by Francisco, her husband. During this , the 2 agents paid $6,000 and presented no identification.\nVirginia DMV spokeswoman, Pam Goheen, said one of the steps taken to beef up enforcement and auditing efforts at service centers is to have all applications double checked by \"document verifiers\". Goheen said, \"There is a heightened awareness of the importance of a driver's license,\" and called the arrests \"unfortunate and disappointing\".\nMiriam Martinez was a clerk at a DMV service center for 2 years ending in 1998, and then again briefly in 2003. The earlier incident of ID fraud stemmed out of that location. Both cities, Tysons Corner and Alexandria, are within commuting distance to Washington, D.C."}

According to Mr Howard the decision is the result of a request from the United States and others. \nOpposition leader Kim Beazley has said that Labor supported the plan. Mr Beazley has been critical of the government in recent weeks because of its military focus on Iraq rather than Afghanistan, which he says is the source of the terrorist threat. \nBeazley offered that it has been \"obvious for some time that the job was only partially completed when the commitment was made earlier.\" \nThe commitment comes amid a resurgence of the Taliban and an increase in insurgency activities in Afghanistan. \n\"The progress that has been made in the establishment of a legitimate government in Afghanistan has come under increasing attack and pressure from the Taliban - and some elements of al-Qaeda,\" Mr Howard said. \nThe additional troop commitment has been welcomed by the Afghani government. Lutfullah Mashal, Afghanistan's Interior Ministry spokesman, said that assistance with security or reconstruction and development is always welcome, however he expressed disappointment that the deployment would only be for 12 months. Mr Howard has said that he does not like to make open ended commitments, and also stated that extra security would be needed for the APEC summit in 2007. \n\"At the time of the APEC meeting and in the months leading up to it, the need in this country is for a heightened elite security capacity,\" he said."}

The bank previously offered 100% financing to professionals in finance and medicine, but is now to offer this product to anyone who can afford to meet the repayments.\nThe development is a huge boost for first time home buyers who have been struggling to get on the Irish property market in recent years due to the rapid increase in house prices. A typical first time buyer in Dublin with 92% financing would normally have to put down a deposit of \u20ac20,000-\u20ac30,000 in cash, but now have the option to produce no deposit.\nFirst Active has said that 100% mortgages will be available across its entire range of mortgage products.\nNote however that this is not necessarily an entirely positive development.\nThe United States and most of Europe have experienced a housing price bubble in recent years. A bubble occurs when buyers purchase a property not because its price is appropriate for its actual value but because they expect the price to significantly rise in the short term permitting resale with a profit.\nIn other words, the prices people pay for properties becomes divorced from the real value of the property; the purchase is speculative and depends purely upon the expectation that people will continue to buy properties in this way (e.g. without proper consideration of their real value).\nThe terrible weakness in this is that when the market corrects itself and prices fall to a level where properties are being priced at their actual realistic value, anyone holding a property loses a great deal of money, since the price they paid does not reflect the actual realistic value of the property.\nThis kind of shock to the housing market is extremely undesirable. Significant write downs in the value of property often significantly depress the economy as a whole.\nLess than 100% mortgages force buyers to invest a significant amount of money in the act of purchasing their house, which tends to discourage purely speculative purchasing, thus helping to mediate house price bubbles.\nWith 100% financing, anyone who can meet repayments can speculatively purchase a property. This naturally encourages pricing bubbles."}

The information was obtained by \"Associated Press\" on the condition of anonymity because of grand jury hearing secrecy. The reported source was in the legal profession.\nThe press reports followed Thursday's televised call by former U.S. Ambassador Joseph Wilson, the husband of one-time CIA operative Valerie Plame, for President Bush to honor his word to remove any official involved in the Plame leak. \nOn Thursday's \"NBC's \"Today\"\" show, Wilson said it was time for the President to \"stand up and prove to the American people that his word is his bond and fire Karl Rove.\" and \"this cover-up is becoming unraveled. That's why you see the White House stonewalling.\"\nAmid refusals by President Bush or his White House press secretary Scott McClellan to comment on the on-going investigation into the Plame leak, the Bush overall approval rating, now at 45%, has slipped one point from May. The \"Wall Street Journal/NBC News\" poll found for the first time that 45% chose poor, versus 41% good, for rating the president as \"honest and straightforward\". His disapproval rating, now 49%, is up 2 points.\nAmerican support for the war effort in Iraq remains strong, at 57 to 42% in favor. And the majority believe the war in Iraq is part of the broader goal of battling global terrorism by a margin of 61 to 34 %.\nGiven the favorable opinion ratings on the war, the current furor in the press and by partisan Democrats are questions about personal accountability, and not about U.S. war policy. Bush has so far demonstrated by his silence that he is willing to let the matter of Rove be settled by the court.\nSpecial Prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald is in charge of the federal probe seeking what is believed to involve two officials at the White House. At issue concerning Rove is whether he broke the Intelligence Identities Protection Act. The act makes it a felony crime for Rove to intentionally and knowingly leak the identity of Plame. At the time, Plame was a CIA Counter-proliferation Division employee.\nFitzgerald is not obliged to publicly reveal any information on testimony received during grand jury hearings on the matter, and has not commented. What is known is that Matt Cooper's reporting notes sent by e-mail to his employer \"TIME\" magazine show that Rove identified Judith Plame as \"Wilson's wife\", and from the context of their conversation, Cooper's notes report that she \"apparently works\" at the CIA. Whether he revealed that Plame was a covert agent remains to be found. \nMr. Wilson has from the start shown his willingness to comment on the actions of the Bush administration. From his July 2003 Op-Ed piece, which started this whole affair, he was critical of statements made by Bush during his State of the Union Address. Then in August 2003 after his wife's covert cover was blown, came his angry statement to try and get Karl Rove \"frog-marched out of the White House in handcuffs\". \nOn Tuesday this week, during the heightened controversy from the Supreme Court ordered release by \"TIME\" of Cooper's notes, Wilson said \"that Rove was intimately involved in the smear campaign launched after the [Novak] article appeared,\" according \"NBC News\" report. \"Now to find out he talked to Matt Cooper before then only compounds the outrage at the abuse of power.\" Wilson's statements were made off camera."}

The Trust calculates that the tree is around 320 years old meaning that it would have been 150 years old when the Martyrs met in 1834.\nThe story of the Tolpuddle Martyrs is important to many trade unionists in the UK and across the globe. An annual festival is organised in the village by the Trades Union Congress (the umbrella body for trade unions in the UK) attended by thousands of people. \nNigel Costley, the regional secretary of the South West TUC, was quoted as saying: \"The Tolpuddle Tree is one of the most famous trees in the country because it was under there that the Martyrs met - a move that led to their deportation, pardon, and ultimately the foundation of the trade union movement.\"\nThere were six men in the group who came to be known as the Tolpuddle Martyrs. They were all farm labourers and lived in poverty. Their leader, George Loveless, decided to set up a union to give the labourers bargaining strength over their wages.

Police believe that a U.S. trained chemist, Magdi Asdi el-Nashar, 33, helped build the bombs that killed over 50 people. \nMr. el-Nashar, who has a PhD from Leeds University, left England two weeks before the bombings. After the London bombings, British authorities initiated a worldwide manhunt that found him in Cairo. State security officials reported they have begun questioning el-Nashar with British agents in attendance.\nMr. el-Nashar arrived in Britain in October 2000 to study for his doctorate, which he was awarded in May. A university spokesperson said he was doing \"environmentally friendly research involving chemically inactive substances.\"\nThe Egyptian interior ministry has said \"[Mr] el-Nashar denied having any relation with the latest events in London. He pointed out that all his belongings remained in his apartment in Britain.\"\nFriends of Mr. el-Nashar said he \u201cwas well-liked and showed no interest in politics.\u201d His friend, Kadhem Al-Rawi, a doctor in Islamic Principles at the European Institute of Human Sciences in Wales said \"He had a great personality. You would never ever expect this kind of action from him. Impossible.\" This is a recurring theme heard from many of the suspected bombers, families and friends. Many believed the suspects had little or no motive to carry out the attacks.\n\"BBC\" security correspondent, Gordon Corera, said it was believed that Mr. el-Nashar handed over keys to a house in Leeds that was used by the bombers. British police are searching a house in Leeds linked to Mr. el-Nashar, although he is not yet formally named a suspect. He told questioners that he was on holiday in Egypt and left all his belongings in his apartment, but his plans were to return to Britain. \nThe alleged involvement in the attacks by Mr. el-Nashar is yet unclear. Police said they were hunting financiers, supporters and chemists who assembled the bomb used in the attacks. \nExplosives.\nA man injured in the bus bombing in Tavistock Square died in hospital on Thursday, bringing the number of confirmed victims to 51. Three of the bombers have also been confirmed dead, with the fourth also thought to have died.\nSources have told the BBC that explosives found in one of the homes is from ingredients available from high-street chemists. \nThey were the same kind of explosive Richard Reid had in his shoes when he tried to blow up a trans-Atlantic flight in 2001.\nAnti-terrorist agencies are worried other \"educated amateurs\" could try to make more of the explosive, as the risk of accidents in the manufacturing process is very high.\nAl-Qaeda operative.\nA suspected al-Qaeda member may have entered Britain via a Channel port two weeks before the bombs, but was not kept under surveillance. The man apparently left Britain hours before the blasts.\nSpeaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Metropolitan Police commissioner Sir Ian Blair said there was nothing connecting the man to the plot, but added that investigators expected to find evidence linking al-Qaeda to the attacks. He said the bombers were only the \"foot soldiers\" of the operation and the mastermind was still being sought.\n\"What we've got to find is, who encouraged them, who trained them, and who's the chemist,\" he said.\nHe said police would also work with the Muslim community, which he said had been \"close to denial\" about extremist preachers, to defeat terrorism. \"We will break this horror that has descended upon us,\" he said.\nSuspects.\nThe current suspects for carrying out the London bombings are:"}

The key was the Yankees' hot bats. The Bronx Bombers hit 4 homeruns in total, the last one a thunderous 2-run blast by Alex Rodriguez off converted Red Sox starter Curt Schilling, who was in his first appearance as a relief pitcher after his rehab stint in the minors.\nBoston jumped out to a quick 4-0 lead against Yankees starter Mike Mussina, establishing the sort of lead that would usually cause the Yankees to fold during the first half of the season. However, the torrid hitting of the Yankee lineup over the last two weeks would not allow that. Mussina adjusted to the tight strike zone as the game progressed, allowing just one run over the next five innings, and the Yankees chipped away at the BoSox' lead. Bernie Williams, Jason Giambi, and Gary Sheffield all hit solo shots off Red Sox starter Bronson Arroyo. At the end of the sixth inning the score was tied, 5-5, and both starters were done for the day. The game would come down to relief pitching.\nDavid Ortiz put the Red Sox ahead in the bottom of the seventh, hitting a bases-empty home run off Tanyon Sturtze to push the score to 6-5. The Yankees rebounded in the top half of the eighth when Ruben Sierra, pinch-hitting for rookie CF Melky Cabrera, connected for a double, tying the game at 6-all.\nSchilling came on in the top of the ninth and promptly hung a 2-2 splitter over the plate for Gary Sheffield, who lined a double off the wall in left-center. Rodriguez was up next, and hit another splitter that never split. The two-run homer gave the Yankees their first lead of the game. Mariano Rivera came on in the bottom of the ninth and silenced the Red Sox bats by striking out the side to end the game, recording his 21st save.\nBoston has lost three straight games and is now 10 games over .500 at 49-39. The Yankees (47-40) have won 8 of 9 games dating back to before the All-Star break and currently sit in 3rd place, half a game behind 2nd-place Baltimore.\nNotes: Rookie Yankees pitcher Chien-Ming Wang, who has been one of the Yankees' most consistent performers, has been placed on the 15-day DL with a shoulder injury. It has been speculated that Wang, who tore his labrum while in the minors, may be out for the season. Wang was slated to start tonight's game, but will be replaced by Tim Redding as he waits for an appointment with Dr. James Andrews on Monday...Former Red Sox manager Joe Kerrigan has been signed by the Yankees as an advance scout. General manager Brian Cashman has said that Kerrigan will be used to analyze film of opponents, not as a coach."}

The report, carried out by external consultancy AEA Technology, estimates these costs to have been \u00a39 billion ($16 billion US) in 2002. The Government says it wants to work with the food industry to reduce social and environmental impacts by 20% by 2012.\nThe report set out to make an assessment of the impact of food miles and to develop a set of indicators that will show when progress has been made to reduce these negative impacts. The distance that food travels between producer and consumer (food miles) has increased over the past ten years. \nIncreasing food miles has been seen as undesirable in and of itself but the report says that the situation is more complex and that the mode of transport has to be taken in to account. The increase in food miles between 1992 and 2002 was associated with increasing levels of congestion and increasing emissions of greenhouse gases while emmissions of some local pollutants such as SOx and NOx have declined.\nThe Food and Drink Federation, which speaks for food manufacturers, was concerned about the focus on food miles but welcomed the \"acknowledgement that more local sourcing does not automatically reduce the environmental and social costs associated with food miles.\" The Federation went on to stress that \"on imported ingredients, the usual mode of transport used by food manufacturers is by sea, which does not give rise to any significant impacts. Air transport is generally not used by food manufacturers.\"\nAnother industry group, the British Retail Consortium said that retailers would \"welcome the opportunity to introduce further transport efficiencies into their operations - always working from the principle that making existing resources work harder makes both good environmental and commercial sense.\"\nEnvironmental campaign group Friends of the Earth is worried that the UK Government will not take the firm action it believes is necessary in the light of the report. A statement from the group said \"The Government must get tougher to reduce food miles. Unless it tackles this problem the impacts will become worse and Government targets to reduce carbon dioxide levels will be much harder to achieve.\" "}

Since that release, further games were developed: \"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City\", and \"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\". \nThursday, according to a report filed by Gamespot, congresswoman Hillary Clinton called on the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to \"take immediate action to determine the source of graphic pornographic and violent content appearing on the \"Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas\" video game.\" Clinton also wanted the FTC to determine if an \"AO\" rating would be more suitable for the game than current \"M\" rating.\nClinton said she would work quickly to create a bill for a federal law that would \"put some teeth into video game ratings.\" The federal legislation by Clinton would follow similar state initiatives. California assemblymen Leland Yee introduced a bill in his state, as did Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich. The purpose of the state and federal bills would be to \"prohibit the sale of violent and sexually explicit video games to minors.\" The passage and enactment of the proposed bill by Clinton would make it a federal offence to sell video game content to persons under the age of the games's rating.\nLike many \"Grand Theft Auto\" gamers, the Entertainment Software Rating Board(ESRB) is cautious over Clinton legislative proposal. Patricia Vance, the president of ESRB, issued this statement: \"We urge all parties not to rush to judgment until all of the relevant facts, some of which are highly technical and complicated, have been established. Any second guessing at this point would be premature and inappropriate as this investigation continues.\" Vance said amongst the ESRB's top interests were to protect children, to educate parents, and make sure parents make good decisions on what video games their children be allowed to play.\nJack Thompson, the subject of beefs with \"Grand Theft Auto\" in the past, is a Republican attorney from Miami. Thompson sent out an email to major gaming outlets (Gamespot for example). The letter at first stated \"I, as a lifelong Republican, am going to thank Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton,\" and offered admiration for Clinton's campaign against violence and sexual content in video games. The email then went on to criticize Doug Lowenstein, who helps manage ESRB and is the president of the Entertainment Software Association. Thompson wrote, \"Doug Lowenstein could have prevented what is going to happen today, but he preferred to shoot the messengers.\" Thompson also mentioned the Columbine High School massacre, and claimed it was the fault of the developers of games (specifically id Software, the maker of Doom). He claims the U.S. Constitution first amendment right to freedom of speech in no way protects the gaming industry from censorship. \nLowenstein issued the following statement regarding the current video game/Hot Coffee issue: \"Retailers should not sell Mature games to minors, parents should watch what their kids watch, and parents should and can rely on the ESRB ratings to make the right choices for their families. We hope that... Senator Clinton will abandon the bill and work cooperatively with industry and others to ensure that parents take advantage of the effective tools on the market to regulate the games their kids play.\"\nAlthough some of the statements mentioned are related to video games in general and not so much GTA, a majority of all of this recently publicity did indeed start with the \"Hot Coffee mod\" for Grand Theft Auto. ESRB has never been pressured any harder in the past than they are now, and Rockstar still denies that they put the sex scenes in the game; although it has been recently demonstrated that Action Max-Replay (a cheat/feature-unlocking system for the Sony PlayStation 2) allows the user to play the \"mini sex games\" - the exact same thing the Hot Coffee mod unlocks for the PC version of GTA San Andreas."}

Two others were wounded, though not life-threateningly. \nThe three soldiers were from the Warrior-equipped 1st Battalion, The Staffordshire Regiment. The regiment is stationed in Tidworth, Wiltshire. It arrived in Iraq in April as part of 12 Mechanised Brigade.\nOn 16 July, an MoD statement said that no further information would be disclosed until families had been informed. The following day, the MoD released the names of the three killed. They were: Second Lieutenant Richard Shearer, Private Leon Spicer, and Private Phillip Hewett. \nRoadside attack.\nThe roadside attack took place in the early hours of 16 July when three armoured Land Rovers were patrolling through the Risala neighbourhood of Al Amarah, capital of Maysan province. The attack brings the British forces death toll in Iraq to 92.\nThe Staffordshire Regiment is the lead component of Task Force Maysan, based in Camp Abu Naji, just outside Amarah. The Task Force has responsibility for the entire province, which is north of Al Basrah province. \nTask Force Maysan has experienced previous attacks in the past few months. According to the MoD website, on 6 June Private Adam Mills of the Staffordshire Regiment discovered a roadside bomb which was subsequently made safe. \nPrevious violence in Amarah.\nAmarah has a population of about 340,000 and has been the scene of previous violence against British forces. In May, two British soldiers were killed in the city. In 2004, it was the scene of fierce fighting between British forces and Iraqi insurgents, which led to the awarding of the Victoria Cross to Private Johnson Beharry of the 1st Battalion, Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment\nIn Majar Al-Kabir, near Al Amarah, a patrol of six Royal Military Police were surrounded and killed by an Iraqi mob on 24 June 2003.\nThe 16 July attack is the largest loss of life in a single day for the British Army since 4 November 2004, when 3 soldiers of the Black Watch were killed in northern Iraq in a suicide car attack. The largest loss of life sustained by British forces as a whole took place on 30 January 2005, when a C-130K transport crashed north of Baghdad, killing nine RAF and one Army personnel."}

On the surface it would seem Utah would be a likely scene of intense religious pressure in public schools over the teaching of evolution. But unlike states with a strong Christian conservative presence, Utah's LDS leaders have avoided some of the more contentious separation state and church battles.\nOn the topic of divine design, official LDS church spokesmen have been largely silent at least in public.

The ACLU of Utah has posted a paper on divine design on its web site (http://www.acluutah.org).

The federal lawsuit claims the company practices fee fixing on transactions, and with restricting competition among member banks.\nThe retail merchants claim that Visa acts in collusion with its member banks to fix transaction fees taken as a percentage of each retail sale. The suit was filed Thursday in the U.S. District Court in Manhattan, and seeks unspecified damages. \nMember banks, those banks that issue and process merchants\u2019 Visa transactions, are unable to negotiate transaction fees directly with the merchant, and merchants are forced to accept Visa purchases regardless of the issuing bank. The complaint says, \u201cThe merchant restraints have resulted in exorbitant interchange fees that bear no relationship to the cost of the services being provided.\" \nMerchants see the rising use of card transactions and the effect it has on their bottom line. The interchange fees are currently 1.75% from most banks, but on some cards it rose this year to 2.9%. The National Retail Federation said for 2004 that between Visa and MasterCard, they pulled in $17.4 billion, a surcharge borne by the consumer regardless of whether they pay by cash or plastic.\nRetailers do not oppose transaction fees, but believe they should be based on market forces. They claim that technology has lowered the cost of processing the transactions, but the savings is not being passed along to them. There are currently four major credit card providers in the U.S.\n\"Webpronews\" writer John Smith cites this merchant quote: \"The collective setting of interchange fees by Visa and its member banks constitutes horizontal price-fixing that leads to higher retail prices for our customers,\" said Paul Heldman, Kroger senior vice president and general counsel. \"This hidden cost must be borne by all Kroger customers, whether they pay for their groceries with cash, by check or by debit or credit card. At a time when technology has made card authorization and processing faster, cheaper, safer and more efficient than ever, we believe that our customers should be receiving the benefit of declining interchange fees. Instead, Visa is using its extraordinary market power to profit at our customers' expense.\"\nA small group of Connecticut retailers filed a similar lawsuit last month naming along with Visa, MasterCard and several other large banks. The suit was filed in Connecticut\u2019s federal court. That suit also calls the fees \u201cexorbitant\u201d.\nThe Vice-President of Visa, Paul Cohen, said \"It appears this is another in a series of attempts by some merchants to receive all the value of electronic payments, while shifting their normal costs of doing business onto consumers.\" "}

Iraqi law states that a trial can only begin 45 days after the charges have been made, and therefore the proceedings could start as early as September. \nOther than Saddam Hussein, his brother-in-law Barzan Ibrahim Al-Hassan, former vice-president Taha Yasin Ramadan and former top judge Awad Badar Al-Bender are also being charged in the Dujail case.\nThe Iraqi Government has said it plans to bring only 12 charges against the former leader, each of them carrying the death penalty, out of a possible 500 of which he is accused. The trial is expected to start as early as September. "}

Those 21 were French language teachers and Japanese researchers who taught French. In 2004, Ishihara said that no one can count in the French language. Ishihara was sued for 500,000 yen (approx. US $4,457) for each plaintiff, including Malik Berkane, a French private language school owner in Tokyo. In addition, the plaintiffs demanded that he make an apology.\nOn October 19, 2004, Ishihara said \"French language is a language in which no one can count, therefore it seems to me reasonable that it is disqualified as an international language. People who are tied to the language have taken it upon themselves to oppose [me]. It is all ridiculous\" in a speech Ishihara made at the inaugural celebrations of the \"Tokyo U-Club\". The Tokyo U-club was founded to support the foundation of Tokyo Metropolitan University (Japanese: \u9996\u90fd\u5927\u5b66\u6771\u4eac, \"Shuto daigaku Tokyo\"), which was planned by Ishihara as replacement of universities run by the Tokyo metropolitan government including the same name in English (Japanese: \u6771\u4eac\u90fd\u7acb\u5927\u5b66 \"Tokyo Toritsu Daigaku\").\nOn August 1, 2003, Ishihara issued his plan to found the new university. His plan had no relation to the restructuring plan of the former Tokyo Metropolitan University which had been on-going for years in cooperation with faculty and Tokyo prefectural government. In his new plan faculties of Humanities, Economics and Law would be drasticially changed and divided into newly organized faculties and departures. As for humanities, literature and language studies would be re-organized into language section and literature section, reduced in number of students, and undergraduate and graduate would be relocated into separate campuses. Quite a few members of the Faculty of Humanities opposed this idea strongly and called for opposition widely. As to that its all faculty issued the opposition on the consensus of all faculty on September 25, 2003. The department of French literature and language was a key group in the movment. Also in 2004, Professor Masato Goda, a teacher of French literature, resigned to express his opposition toward Ishihara's educational policy. \nBerkane said \"I was very shocked when I heard that. Of course we can count numbers in French, and it is used as an official language in international organisations.\" \"I have been in Japan for 23 years. I am sad that what I have taught in that time is denigrated.\" Berkane said that he had sent a memorandum to Ishihara in February to ask the governer to apologize but he had as yet received no reply from Ishihara.\nOn July 15, Ishihara again expressed his opinion that French was formerly a diplomatic lingua franca but due to its complexity it had been falling back. He mentioned that no student had registered in French language lessons at the newly founded Tokyo Metropolitan University. He also stated plaintiffs should have considered seriously if his criticism was appropriate or not."}

Other roads were reported closed as well. \nWhile islanders did not get through the two storms unscathed, and 4 people were left dead, the Land and Environment Minister Dean Peart told reporters, \"Mercifully, Jamaica was spared the worst\".\nBuses were sent by officials to southern coastal areas to evacuate residents from the flood prone region, but most refused to leave and preferred to ride it out beside 8 foot waves that pounded areas of the coast line. Wind gusts of 155 mph doubled over palm trees in the capital city of Kingston.\nAt a southern penninsula seaside fishing villiage, Port Royal residents boarded up and prepared for the worst again, as surfers gathered nearby to take on the challenge of 15 to 18 foot waves. \"If I'm going to die, it's going to be right here,\" said a local resident Gordon Murphy, 39, with his 2-year-old son. \"What's next?\" he joked, \"[Hurricane] Franklin?\"\nMany shops and businesses stayed open as long as they could, classifying it as another inconvenience despite its near Category 5 strength. Instead of the possible disaster that many prepared for, by late afternoon, Emily had all but disappeared. Light scattered showers in some areas of the island were the only remnant, as residents went about their lives after the second hurricane scare in as many weeks.\nSupplies that many stocked for Dennis and Emily may yet be put to use. Many wonder what storms are yet to come. Authorities say this will be one of the most active hurricane seasons in history. Emily was the strongest and earliest to form this year since records, dating back to 1860, have been kept.\nEarlier, Emily stuck Grenada on Thursday with nearly a direct hit. A national disaster was called the day after its winds ravaged hundreds of homes and killed at least one man."}

In total, women and children accounted for about 18% of all civilian deaths.\nAnti-occupation forces/insurgents accounted for 9% of the deaths, while criminal violence was blamed for 36%. The 28 page dossier also claimed that the situation in Iraq is getting worse. The fatalties in the second year after the invasion were twice as high as in the first year after the end of the war. At least 42,500 civilians were reported wounded.\nMore than a third of the report was based on the work of Reuters, the Associated Press and Agence France Presse. Three-quarters of reports had at least one primary source, while 23% had two or more.\nThe Iraqi government disputed the figures. The Ministry of Health's figures recorded 6,629 deaths in the year leading up to April 2005, one-third of which were due to \"terrorist incidents\", with the remainder due to coalition forces. The Ministry of Interior, which also records deaths in the armed forces, reported 8,175 Iraqis were killed between July 2004 and May 2005.\nReuters noted that the figures apparently fail to note the number of people killed by suicide bombers in the last 18 months - with over 2,000 lives taken by car bombers, while the report claims that only 1,000 people have been killed by suicide bombers over 24 months. Reuters also pointed out that the report may underestimate deaths, as the media - the basis for the report - focuses mainly on Baghdad.\n\"The international forces try to avoid civilian casualties, whereas the terrorists target civilians and try to kill as many of them as they can,\" the government said in a statement\nThe US military also disputed the figures and said it is doing everything to avoid civilian casualties. \"Since the start of Operation Iraqi Freedom until now, we have categorically not targeted civilians\", said Lieutenant Colonel Steve Boylan, a spokesman for the US military in Baghdad.\n\"The ever-mounting Iraqi death toll is the forgotten cost of the decision to go to war in Iraq. On average, 34 ordinary Iraqis have met violent deaths every day since the invasion of March 2003\", said Professor John Sloboda, one of the authors of the report. He stressed that \"neither the US nor the UK governments have begun to systematically measure the impact of their actions in terms of human lives destroyed.\"\nThe Iraqi Body Count group is based mainly in the Sheffield area of the United Kingdom. The co-founders are a human-rights campaigner, Hamit Dardagan, and Professor Sloboda, a psychologist at the University of Keele who is also a leading anti-war campaigner. The senior researcher is a retired librarian who last worked as the Head of Acquisitions in Keele University Library, and now runs an anti-war mailing list in the Sheffield area.\nOther studies.\nThere have been two other studies into the number of civilians killed in Iraq since March 2003.\nThe first to be published was a report in the British medical journal \"The Lancet\" in October 2004, stating that there had been 98,000 \"excess deaths\". The report was based on a questionnaire given to 998 households in 33 randomly-selected areas of Iraq, intended to be a representative sample. Of the total, 57,600 were given as being caused by accidents and disease, with the rest due to violence. The report had an extremely large margin of error - the 95% confidence interval (ie less than a 0.05% chance of being a fluke) range was from 8,000 up to 194,000.\nThe second report was the UN Development Program Iraq Living Conditions Survey, published in May 2005. This sampled 21,668 households in 2,200 areas, using similar selection and interpretation techniques as the Lancet study. This study recorded 24,000 \"conflict-related deaths\", with a 95% confidence interval of 18,000 to 29,000."}

The Remote Assistance feature is a service of the OS that allows Internet Technology administrators of corporate workgroups remote access to other desktops to perform maintenance and other configuration tasks from their own computer. It can also be used by on-line tech support sites. A support assistant can go into a user\u2019s machine, if the service is enabled, and themself make changes directly to another person's computer to resolve an issue.\nTo initialize the remote assistance feature, the user of the helper computer must first make a request of the user of the target computer. Compliance must be granted by the user of the target machine, which then fully opens the communication port of the target machine to the helper computer. The operator of the helper computer then has control of target computer to make changes at will. The user of the target machine can watch in a separate window the actions of the helper, and either party to the session can end it at any time.\nIn a telephone conversation with a \"Microsoft\" representative Tuesday, it was learned that work to develop a security patch is underway, but when it will be available is unclear. It was cited that a patch must work consistently across multiple platform versions of the OS. \nThe vulnerability, thought at first to affect only Windows XP SP2, is now believed to affect all current Windows editions, including Windows 2000, Windows XP SP1, Windows XP Professional x64, Windows Server 2003, Windows Server 2003 SP1, and Windows Server x64.\nThe Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) is not enabled by default, however if the service is enabled, a Denial of Service attack could cause the OS to restart unexpectedly according to \"Microsoft\", or experience buffer overflows according to \"Symantec\". The RDP is enabled by default on Windows XP Media Center Edition.\n\"Microsoft\" suggests users block TCP port 3389 (the port used by RDP) on their firewall, or disable Terminal Services or Remote Desktop if not required by the user. The remote desktop connections could also be secured using either Internet Protocol Security or a virtual private network connection until a patch is ready.\nTo disable Remote Assistance on a Windows XP Edition, the steps are:\nThe group, Internet Storm Center, detected spikes in scanning for port 3389 beginning July 6. Larger numbers of systems scanned were reported on July 13. Crackers may be scanning for vulnerable machines, the group said. \n\"It's a kernel vulnerability,\" said VP of engineering for Symantec Alfred Huger, \"so it will be difficult to exploit reliably. But he [the original discoverer] found the vulnerability with a commonly-used tool, so if he can find it, so can others. I don't think it will turn it into a large-scale worm, but then, some kernel vulnerabilities have ended up as just that, like the Witty worm.\""}

The same May survey indicated that duck habitats, specifically ponds, had declined more than 35 percent from the historical average. \nHowever, late Spring rains reportedly improved wetland conditions and irrigated grasslands for grazing duck broods and re-nesting hens.

The bill, introduced yesterday by (R,) and (R,), would require immigrant workers to apply from their native countries for a visa to remain in the states. \nThe number of illegal immigrants in the U.S. is estimated to be in the range of 10 to 12 million.\nThe bill is in contrast to a different measure by (D-) and (R-AZ) submitted two months ago. That bill would create a visa category where temporary workers are not tied to any job in particular and would allow them to apply for permanent residence regardless of employment. The bill has republican co-sponsorship from and Jeff Flake, both from where the porous US- border is an issue. \nThe Kennedy-McCain bill allows illegal aliens already in the U.S. to petition the government to remain. A position that Kyl in effect calls the equivalent of granting \"amnesty\". Kennedy answered that criticism by saying, \"The mass deportation of illegal immigrant persons as contemplated by the Cornyn-Kyl bill is not a realistic solution, and won't solve the security and economic problems we face.\"\nThe Kyl-Cornyn bill proposal is an attempt to tie immigrant status to U.S. employment. The legislation would create a guest worker program that would match immigrant workers with jobs mostly not wanted by American citizens. An immigrant worker would be given five years to come into compliance with an employment order. It calls for 10,000 federal agents, at a cost in the range of 2 to 5 billion, to audit employers who hire undocumented workers. Companies that break a proposed new law to monitor undocumented immigrants would be subject to penalties.\nThe bill drew criticism from immigration groups which include two leading Hispanic organizations because of the \"mandatory departure\" requirement. Immigrants who wait five years before leaving the U.S. would pay annual fines totaling $5,000 each year. Or, after making a return trip to their native country, they can again apply from there for a temporary job in the U.S. They would work for two years in the U.S., return home for a year, and then reapply for two more two-year work cycle. The maximum would be six years in the United States. In their home country, they could also apply for U.S. immigrant programs, including the \"green card\" that grants permanent residency. \nKyl said he believes businesses will not object because his plan would make verifying legal workers easier by reducing the documentation required. The basics of the plan include: \nThe bill also calls for replacing the practice currently in place in the U.S. of issuing paper Social Security cards with the issuance of a tamper-proof cards. The identification card is treated by most states as no form of personal identification at all. A birth certificate is considered a primary form of identification, along with driver's licenses, passports and other official state or other territory photo-identification cards. The bill proposes that social security cards should be \"machine readable\" and a primary form of identification. \nA terrorism-driven drive to turn driver's licenses into a national ID card faces hurdles. Peter Costello, treasurer of Australia, said he will not support national ID cards unless there is convincing evidence it fights terrorism."}

Seven, including the three accused of war crimes, have been charged with incidents that took place in September 2003. Four have been charged with the manslaughter of Ahmed Kareem in May 2003. They are alleged to have forced Mr Kareem \u2014 who was detained as a suspected looter \u2014 into the Shatt-al-Arab canal in Basra, where he subsequently drowned. \nThe three \u2014 Corporal Donald Payne, 34; Lance-Corporal Wayne Crowcroft, 21; and Private Darren Fallon, 22 \u2014 have been charged under the International Criminal Court Act 2001, and will be tried domestically, along with the other eight, rather than by the International Criminal Court at The Hague.\nThey are from the 1st Battalion, Queen's Lancashire Regiment (QLR). The regiment has been at the centre of previous accusations of abuse in Iraq. The Daily Mirror published in May 2004 photographs purporting to be of soldiers of the QLR abusing Iraqi prisoners. The photographs were later proven to have been fabricated, and the newspaper's editor, Piers Morgan, resigned.\nCharges.\nLance-Corporal Payne has been charged with manslaughter, inhuman treatment of persons, and perverting the course of justice. He is alleged to have killed Baha D'oud Salim Mousa, a 26-year-old hotel receptionist from Basra. Lance-Corporal Crowcroft and Private Fallon have also been charged with inhuman treatment of persons.\nSergeant Kelvin Stacey, 28, also of the QLR, is alleged to have assaulted an Iraqi detainee and now faces a charge of actual bodily harm. \nColonel Jorge Mendonca, 41, the former commanding officer of the QLR; Major Michael Peebles, 34; and Warrant Officer Mark Davies, 36, both of the Intelligence Corps, have been charged with negligence of duty contrary to the Army Act 1955. \nAll four charged with the manslaughter of Ahmed Kareem (as well as the alleged beating of other detainees) are from the Foot Guards, the British Army's \u00e9lite infantry of the Household Division.

Anyone accused is innocent until proved guilty and it is for the Courts Martial to consider the evidence in any case and reach a verdict.\" \nIn February, three British soldiers were jailed and dismissed from the army when they were found guilty of abusing Iraqis near Basra. The Chief of the General Staff, Sir Mike Jackson, condemned those convicted, and apologised to the victims and the people of Iraq.\nAllowing the prosecution of British soldiers for war crimes has, however, been criticised by former chiefs of the defence staff. Just last week, some former chiefs in the House of Lords said that prosecutions can be demoralising for the British Armed Forces, and can place the lives of soldiers at risk if the fear of prosecution prevents them from opening fire.\nIn May 2005, Lord Boyce, who held the post as an Admiral during the Iraq War, said in an interview with the British newspaper The Observer that he did not believe he had complete immunity from the International Criminal Court. \nIn the interview, he said: \"If my soldiers went to jail and I did, some other people would go with me.\"\nAfter being asked whether Prime Minister Tony Blair and Lord Goldsmith would be with him if he was ever brought to account, Lord Boyce said: \"Too bloody right!\" \nThe honorary Colonel-of-the-Regiment, Brigadier Geoffrey Sheldon, has said in a statement: \"From the moment that Mr Mousa lost his life while in our custody, the regiment has made clear that this was an isolated, tragic incident which should never have happened, and which I and every member of the Queen's Lancashire Regiment bitterly regrets.\"\nThe brigadier did, however, state he found it \"particularly difficult\" to understand why charges had been brought against the former CO of the QLR, saying that: \"It was Colonel Jorge Mendonca, then the commanding officer, who, as soon as he learned of Mr Musa's death, initiated the formal inquiry which has now resulted in these charges being brought.\"\nColonel Mendonca was awarded the Distinguished Service Order (DSO) in Iraq, and was promoted to full colonel shortly afterwards.

However, while the set of patients was evenly split, only 7 patients who received MIT therapy died, and 20 patients who did not receive it died. The result is not highly significant due to the low overall number of people who died.\nA number of studies has recently examined the possible effects of prayer, with mixed results.

However, the Basic Law of Germany does not permit the self-dissolving of the Bundestag. The only way to achieve early elections is when the chancellor loses a motion of confidence. All major parties, including the opposition, support the call for early election. Polls also indicate that 75% of the population support going to the ballots in September. However, some MP's, most notably Werner Schulz of SPD's coalition partner, The Greens, say that the procedure was unconstitutional because the loss of confidence was orchestrated. They announced that they will sue against the dissolving before the Constitutional Court of Germany.\nGermany has been struggling with high unemployment for several years and the reforms Schr\u00f6der introduced were criticized as being neo-liberalistic by unions and also by members of his own party.\nCurrent polls see the CDU at 44%, while the SPD can only expect 27%. The liberal FDP, CDU's possible coalition partner, can expect 7%, The Greens 8% and the Party of the Left (formerly PDS) 11%.\nThe governing SPD-Green coalition is faced with an overwhelming opposition majority in the Bundesrat, the upper chamber, that is able to block most bills. Schr\u00f6der claims that the CDU is engaging in a \"policy of blockade\" rendering him unable to make laws and implement policy changes while Angela Merkel, says that Schr\u00f6der's government is simply \"incapable to take action\"."}

Last week the country's National Communications Council (CNC) ordered the radio station to stop broadcasting indefinitely, claiming that it had insulted them, and that coverage of recent elections had been biased.\nRPA director Alexis Sinduhije said that the claims were unjust, and that the station had given every political party 20 minutes airtime a week during the elections.\nBut he reluctantly agreed to a two-day ban after mediation by a group of professional journalists and private broadcasters between RPA and the CNC.\nEarlier this year, Radio Publique Africain was suspended for two days after being accused of breaking the country's press laws, including \"offending public morals\", by reporting on the rape of an eight-year-old girl and \"deforming\" the words of a politician. RPA observed the ban and was allowed to restart broadcasting afterwards.\nThe ban has been condemned by the international press freedom organisation the Committee to Protect Journalists, who have called on the CNC to lift it \"immediately and unconditionally\"\nA group of Burundian journalists overseas, the \"Collectif des Professionnels des M\u00e9dias de la Diaspora Burundaise\" has also spoken out, in an open letter to the CNC, accusing it of being \"a body of repression which uses disproportionate sanctions\". \nBurundi's recent democratic elections were the first since the 1993 assassination of President Melchior Ndadaye plunged the country into a vicious, ethnically-charged civil war. \n\"Press freedom has been historically related to the emergence of democracy\", the letter continues. \"It is essential that the media, like other instruments of good governance, is protected\". \nRadio Publique Africain was launched in early 2001, seeking to promote peace by hiring both Hutus and Tutsis, including ex-combatants, to work on the editorial team. The station's investigative reporting and grassroots approach to issues affecting ordinary Burundians quickly earned it the nickname \"the People's Radio.\" \n\"We ask the political leaders to answer their concerns: Why are people kept in prison without trial? Why has their land been taken away? Exposing the truth in this way has brought Hutu and Tutsi communities together and made it harder for politicians to manipulate the public\", said RPA director Alexis Sinduhije after receiving a press freedom award last year. \nIn October 2001 Sinduhije was arrested and beaten up after interviewing a South African peacekeeper against the wishes of the Burundian government. In February 2003 armed men broke into Sinduhije's house and murdered his security guard. In September of the same year Radio Publique Africain was taken off the air after broadcasting an interview with a rebel spokesperson. In a show of solidarity, other independent radio stations refused to broadcast any government news or statements until the ban on RPA was lifted. \nBurundi's independent media has become increasingly vocal and vibrant in recent years. The development of the internet has seen the appearance of a number of independent Burundian news websites based overseas, outside the control of Burundi's government and the CNC. When the radio journalist Etienne Ndikuriyo was arrested without charge earlier this year, the Burundian online media helped mobilise international opinion, and he was released eight days later. \nSources.\n "}

He was 85 years old.\nNow, Doohan's family is hoping to beam him up to the \"Final Frontier\" that Scotty loved so dearly. The actor had told relatives he wanted his ashes blasted into outer space, as was done for \"Star Trek\" creator Gene Roddenberry. \"He'll be there with his buddy, which is wonderful,\" said Doohan's agent and longtime friend, Steve Stevens.\nAt the time of his death, he was living in Redmond, Washington in the United States with his wife and their three young children. \nDoohan was born in Vancouver and participated in World War II as a captain in the Royal Canadian Artillery. He lost the middle finger of his right hand at the Invasion of Juno Beach on D-Day, a bloody scene immortalized in the 1998 Steven Spielberg film \"Saving Private Ryan\". Doohan was among the film's greatest supporters, thanking the director for not sanitizing the gore of the actual event.\nHe started his acting career with a radio appearance at a CBC show and went on to act in several character roles. Doohan had already made a name for himself in the entertainment business as a featured voice actor in Canadian and U.S. radio dramas and motion picture voice-overs due to his knack for picking up linguistically perfect accents. His ability to affect a near-perfect Scottish accent made him a natural for the role of Scotty, according to producers at the time.\nWhen he auditioned for what would become the role of his life in 1966, Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry asked him which of the different accents Doohan mastered would best suit the role of Scotty. Doohan respond that he believed \"all the world's best engineers have been Scottish\". After the original Star Trek series had ended, Doohan found himself typecast and had difficulties getting other roles.\nDoohan suffered from Parkinson's as well as Alzheimer's disease. In August last year he received a star on Hollywood's Walk of fame.\nAfter DeForest Kelley, Doohan is the second actor of the original Star Trek cast to die.\nHe is survived by his wife Wende, with whom he had been married since 1975, and seven children."}

It is not yet known if this is connected with the blasts.\nAll the devices were \"conventional\" but possibly faulty, and contained no chemical or biological agents. Not all the bombs exploded fully; Bomb Squad officers are working on making them safe. There are no reports of the deaths of suspects who attempted to set the explosives off. \nIncidents.\nA spokesman for Stagecoach said the driver of the number 26 bus travelling through Shoreditch had heard a bang on upper deck, gone upstairs and seen the windows were blown out. The bus driver was very shaken but is said to be fine. Reports of the windows having been blown out have been denied by a police officer on the scene. \"I have seen the bus. There were no windows blown out,\" the officer told Reuters.\nOne injury sustained at Warren Street tube station has been confirmed by authorities. There have been no other reports of injuries, and authorities are reporting no casualties.\nAt around 15:25, a man was arrested by armed police in Whitehall, which is cordoned off. A second man was arrested in the Whitehall area around 16:15, but Police have confirmed that this arrest is unconnected with the explosions.\nArmed police were deployed at UCL Hospital, near Warren Street tube station, after reports of a suspect entering the hospital. There was speculation that one of the bombers may have been injured and sought treatment at the hospital. A Scotland Yard spokesman had said \"We are dealing with an incident at University College Hospital and we have armed officers deployed there. We cannot go in any further detail at this stage.\" A UCL spokeswoman confirmed that an email had been sent to staff asking them to be on the lookout for the suspect. At 16:00 a spokesman for the Metropolitan police confirmed that the incident was over, but armed police returned to the hospital 30 minutes later to search the premises. Police have now also confirmed this is unrelated to the explosions.\nResponses.\nPrime Minister Tony Blair has cancelled a visit to an east London school and a photocall with visiting Prime Minister John Howard of Australia, instead heading to a COBRA committee emergency meeting. Australian Prime Minister John Howard is in London and is involved in discussions with Tony Blair as this unfolds.\nIn a public press conference, Blair said that \"there appear to have been no casualties\", and that he wanted people to \"React calmly, and continue with our lives\". John Howard also stated that Australia stood by Britain and that people should \"beware the minds of terrorists.\"\nPolice initially advised against unnecessary travel in London, asking Londoners to keep travel to a minimum and avoid the public transport system. At 15:52 Sir Ian Blair of the Metropolitan Police has asked Londoners to return to their normal activities, including travel.

Whitehall had been sealed off but reopened shortly after, only to be closed again after armed police surrounded and arrested a man outside the Ministry of Defence, however at a press conference at 17:45 Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Ian Blair said that this arrest was unconnected with the explosions.\nUnconfirmed reports.\nVarious news sites are reporting a minor explosion in a passenger's backpack. A BBC correspondent, claiming to have sources working in the London Underground, suggested the explosions were only detonators and that the bombs contained no explosives. It is also believed that reports of gunshots being heard at the stations are mistaken, passengers simply mistaking the sound of the detonators for the sound of gunshots.\nA spokesman for London Underground has stated the nature of the incidents is unknown.\nEyewitness reports from Warren Street say that something happened towards the front of the train.

This means the yuan is more expensive and that Chinese goods will become more expensive in western countries. \nEconomic growth in China might also slow down, but it has been soaring for the last several years. This could have serious consequences in China, but a People's Bank of China person has said that the exchange rate will be \"basically stable\".\nChina linked the yuan to the dollar in 1997 during the major economic crisis in Asia. This has provided the stability which has allowed the Chinese economy to grow over the last ten years.

He was pronounced dead at the scene. Sir Ian Blair, the Commissioner of London Metropolitan, told a press conference this afternoon that the man was challenged by police officers (not in uniform) but refused to follow instructions. Some witnesses claim he did not appear to be carrying any arms, but wore a heavy coat that may have concealed a weapon. One passenger, Anthony Larkin, said the man appeared to be wearing a \u201cbomb belt\u201d. \nMark Whitby, apparently the closest eye witness said; \"He half-tripped, was half-pushed to the floor. The policeman nearest to me had the black automatic pistol in his left hand, he held it down to the guy and unloaded five shots into him.\"\nPolice have revealed that the shooting was connected with yesterday's attempted attacks, but but have not confirmed him to be one of the four bombing suspects. Police sources have indicated that the man who was shot had been followed covertly, and after he was confronted he ran off and was followed on foot by up to twenty police from street level into the Underground station. \nLondon Underground suspended some services on the Victoria and Northern lines, citing a request by the police. The Northern line was then completely suspended for a short time mid-afternoon after a security alert at Mornington Crescent Station.\nThe London Ambulance Service have dispatched ambulances and the air ambulance to the scene. The Metropolitan Police have cordoned off a 200 metre perimeter around the station.\nEyewitness accounts.\nPassenger Briony Coetsee said: \"We were on the Tube and then we suddenly heard someone say 'get out, get out' and then we heard gunshots.\"\nMark Whitby, who was sitting just five metres from the incident, told BBC News: \"I saw an Asian [of origin] guy run onto the train hotly pursued by three plain-clothes police officers. One of them was carrying a black handgun - it looked like an automatic - they pushed him to the floor, bundled on top of him and unloaded five shots into him. He was wearing a large coat, unusual for the time of year.\"\n\u201cAs the man got on the train I looked at his face. He looked from left to right, but he basically looked like a cornered rabbit, like a cornered fox. He looked absolutely petrified. He sort of tripped but they were hotly pursuing him and couldn't have been more than two or three feet behind him at this time. He half-tripped, was half-pushed to the floor. The policeman nearest to me had the black automatic pistol in his left hand, he held it down to the guy and unloaded five shots into him. I didn\u2019t see any guns or anything like that; I didn\u2019t see him carrying anything. I didn\u2019t even see a bag to be quite honest.\"\nReports from ITV News suggested that the person shot was another suicide bomber. Sky News (web) reported the same, \nbut later reported that \"initial examinations [...] did not discover any explosives on the suspect.\" \nMeanwhile, The Times reported that police believed the man to be one of the would-be bombers who escaped after the 21 July attacks. BBC News reported that the man had been under surveillance as a result of CCTV footage from the 21 July crime scenes.\nBBC in London alerts: At-a-glance reports: Police say the man shot at Stockwell had been followed by surveillance officers because he had emerged from a house linked to the investigation into Thursday's blasts.\nPassenger Anthony Larkin told BBC News the man appeared to be wearing a \"bomb belt with wires coming out\"."}

My deepest sympathies to the wounded, the families and the people of Egypt.\"\nIn a telegram to the Egyptian President this morning, Mrs. Maryam Rajavi, the President-elect of the National Council of Resistance of Iran, offered her condolences to the \"brother nation of Egypt\" on the death of, and injury to, a large number of Egyptian and foreign nationals during the bombings in Sharm al-Sheikh last night. She prayed for patience for the families of those killed and quick recovery for those injured. Mrs. Rajavi underscored, \"Islamic fundamentalism and the terrorism emanating from it constitute the biggest threat to world peace and security. The heart of this ominous phenomenon is beating in Iran under the mullahs' regime, the leading sponsor of terrorism in the world today.\" She expressed hope that with the overthrow of the inhuman regime and the establishment of democracy in Iran, the world would see the eradication of the ideology of hate and violence, falsely propagated under the name of Islam, the great religion of compassion, friendship and tolerance. It is worthy of note that on Wednesday, the daily Kayhan, the mouthpiece of Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, brazenly boasted, \"Iran has an incalculable capacity to destabilize the entire Middle East. Given the circumstance, this destabilization could include a wide range of activities from limited local clashes to plunging the entire region into chaos and clashes.\""}

He began playing folk and jazz music as a teenager in the 1950s but his deep voice resonated with the blues. Eric Clapton credits seeing Baldry play as an inspiration for him to play the blues himself. In the early 1960s Baldry sang with Alexis Korner's influential band, Blues Incorporated, and then went on to lead a series of bands himself and featured many new musicians who would go onto superstardom, including Rod Stewart, Mick Jagger, Charlie Watts, Jack Bruce, and Jimmy Page.\nHe befriended Paul McCartney while playing at the Cavern in Liverpool and performed on The Beatles' internationally televised special \"Around the Beatles\" in 1964. \nIn 1966, Baldry adopted Bluesology for his back-up band, after seeing \"promise\" in the young keyboard player, Reginald Dwight. In 1968, Dwight adopted the name Elton John, taking the name John in tribute to Baldry.\nIn 1978, he moved to the United States, spending time in New York and Los Angeles, before moving on to Vancouver permanently about 1980 and becoming a Canadian citizen.\nBaldry has released over 40 albums and, in the last twenty years, done much voice-over work in Canada for commercials and animations including ReBoot and narrating the Disney production, \"The Original Story Of Winnie-The-Pooh\", which earned him a 1998 Grammy \"spoken word album for children\" nomination.\nBefore his illness, it had been anticipated that Baldry would be touring in the autumn in support of new recordings produced by Rod Stewart and Elton John to be released this September."}

The two were hanged July 19.\nOnly the age of one of the two executed teens was officially released to the public. He was 18 year old Ayaz Marhoni. The other, Mahmoud Asgari, according to the (ISNA) was aged 17, but other news agencies have reported the teenager's age as 16. In the original report by the ISNA it was said that the two were found having together when they were both 16. It also reported that they were held and beaten for fourteen months before the execution.\nThe UK-based gay rights group, claims the report issued later by the government of Iran is a \"smokescreen\" to justify killing homosexuals. And one media outlet, Direland, has blasted the media holdings of that includes Fox News Channel and \"The Times\" newspaper for publishing the subsequent Iranian government issued allegation of rape as matter of fact without mention of the previous stories before international condemnation bearing no such accusations.\nAccording to Iranian newspapers, the two boys were given 228 lashes for their other convictions of theft, disrupting public order and public drinking before they were hanged in Edalat (\"\"Justice\" in English\") Square in the Iranian city of . The executioners, fearing reprisals, wore masks and anti-riot forces were mobilized to prevent outbreaks of public protests. \nPhotos of the execution released by Iranian Students News Agency showed the two teens crying in the truck driving them to the in Justice Square, located in the northeastern region of the country.\nExecuting youth.\nIran has been under fire by international human rights groups for executing teenagers in the past, including the 2004 execution of , a 16-year-old girl convicted of having . Medical reports, not allowed in the court, had stated that she was .\nLike many other Islamic countries, Iran enforces the religious sharia law, which allows for the execution of children, including girls aged nine or older and boys 15 and older. \nIranian officials have complained that the media has emphasized the teens' ages. Deputy Ali Asgari said, \"Whatever sentence is decreed by an Islamic penal system must be approved, unless proven otherwise... Instead of paying tribute to the action of the judiciary, the media are mentioning the age of the hanged criminals and creating a commotion that harms the interests of the state... Even if certain websites made a reference to their age, journalists should not pursue this. These individuals were corrupt. Their sentence was carried out with the approval of the judiciary and it served them right.\"\nBoth teens were convicted by Court No. 19 under sharia law. The teens are identified only as \"M.A.\" and \"A.M.\" Those found having homosexual sex in Iran may face death by either hanging, stoning, cutting in half by a sword, or dropping from a tall building or cliff.\nAn ISNA report said the couple acknowledged having sexual relations with each other but said they were unaware of laws against homosexuality.\nControversy over subsequent rape allegations.\nAnother report, by \"Iran In Focus,\" claimed that the two were hanged not for gay sex, but rather for sexually assaulting a thirteen year old boy at knife point. Neither the original \"Iranian Student's News Agency\" nor an additional report from the \"\" had this allegation, said the United Kingdom based \"OutRage!\". \"Direland Press\" has noted that the accusation of rape in reports came days after international outrage and detailed reports by other Iranian news agencies. They suggest the recent report is a ploy of the Iranian government to justify its actions.\n\"The allegation of sexual assault may either be a trumped-up charge to undermine public sympathy for the youths -- a frequent tactic by the Islamist regime in Iran -- or it may be that the 13-year-old was a willing participant but that Iranian law ... deems that no person of that age is capable of sexual consent and that therefore any sexual contact is automatically deemed in law to be a sex assault,\" said OutRage!'s Peter Tatchell.\n\"This is just the latest barbarity by the Islamo-fascists in Iran,\" Tatchell remarked. \"The entire country is a gigantic prison, with Islamic rule sustained by detention without trial, torture and state-sanctioned murder.\"\nPoor track record with human rights groups.\nTatchell told reporters that according to Iranian human rights activists, more than 4,000 lesbians and gay men have been executed in Iran since the seized power in 1979. He said an estimated 100,000 Iranians have been executed in Iran since that time.\nReports also indicated that three other gay Iranian teenagers are reportedly being hunted by police, but they are said to have gone into hiding.\nOutRage! requested the international community see Iran \"as a state\" and to \"break off diplomatic relations, impose trade sanctions, and give practical support to the democratic and left opposition inside Iran.\"\nThe United Kingdom has a policy of constructive engagement with Iran, as does France and Germany, primarily directed at the resolution of the Iranian nuclear crisis.\nEuropean Union officials have been holding a human rights dialogue with Tehran, but last year the report by Human Rights Watch said that violations had increased since 2000.\nIn the Unites States, the has called for U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice to condemn the executions."}

Bush of flip-flopping on his pledge to fire anybody on his staff involved with the Valerie Plame leak.\nJohnson, a participant in yesterday's Democratic hearing on Capitol Hill, said \"We deserve people who work in the White House who are committed to protecting classified information, telling the truth to the American people, and living by example to the idea that a country at war with Islamic extremists cannot focus its efforts on attacking other American citizens who simply tried to tell the truth.\"\nHouse and Senate Democrats held a highly partisan hearing Friday where four retired U.S. intelligence officials aired views that were critical of the Plame leak itself, and then critical of Bush administration and Republican efforts to minimize damage caused by the controversy.\nFormer CIA case officer, Jim Marcinkowski, testified that the current administration policy of setting a criminal standard for dismissal was too high, and that Bush should take action on those persons involved. \"Each time the political machine made up of prime-time patriots and partisan ninnies display their ignorance by deriding Valerie Plame as a mere paper-pusher, or belittling the varying degrees of cover used to protect our officers, or continuing to play partisan politics with our national security, it's a disservice to this country,\" he said.\nThe hearing was not an official proceeding of Congress. Democratic lawmakers organized it after Republican leaders in congressional committees with jurisdiction in these matters rejected their request for a legislative oversight hearing. Representative Henry Waxman (D-CA), the ranking minority member of the House Committee on Government Reform, said \"A special standard seems to apply to Karl Rove: There will be no questions asked, and no accountability.\"\nMeanwhile, a Vermont native Dennis Morrisseau, 62, plans a Republican run for a soon to be vacated seat in the House of Representatives. Bernard Sanders (I-Vt) will leave the post in his run for a Senate seat. Central to Morrisseau's bid is his pledge to bring articles of impeachment against George W. Bush."}

The man may have been taking the explosive to the tourist area of Kerdassa, where souvenir shops are located in a bazaar near the pyramids, said an official.\nEgyptian security forces have detained 70 suspects in a sweep to find the perpetrators in Saturday's early morning bombings that killed 88 and left hundreds injured.\nThe police investigation of the bombings has targeted a smaller number of people than the October 2004 roundup that followed attacks in the Sinai resorts of Tabas and Ras Shitan. 3,000 people were detained for questioning in those bombings.
