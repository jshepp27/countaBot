The total offspring is presumably equal to the number of people who contributed to it.

For example a sudden small jerking movement of an arm on the steering wheel leading the car into oncoming traffic can lead to almost certain instant death. I cannot think of any other action in my daily life where so many small actions of me or other people can be lethal.Even leaving accidents and catastrophic scenarios out of consideration driving a car seems extremely risky to me For many maybe most people their car is the most expensive single item that they own.

My argument is as follows The chances of the entire world adopting a veganvegetarian diet are slim to nonea Therefore there will always be a market for meat and other animal products The food market like all other markets operates on general principles of supply and demand Meat farmers can use techniques exhibiting a range of costs or benefits both in terms of environmental impact and animal welfare. A vegan or vegetarian diet denies demand and thus potential revenue to all meatproducing farms regardless of how humane or environmentally sound their practice are.a Since the majority of farms are large factory farms I concede that this is probably good for animal welfare. However Purchasing meat from farms known to produce their meat in an ethical way not only denies demand to large factory farms but helps improve the market share of ethical meatgrowing which seems as though it would be even better for animal welfare.My general view is that people should probably as a rule eat less meat from better growers and that will make for a bigger shift in growing practices than simply people dropping out of eating meat altogether. Moreover this practice would be much easier to evangelize than a vegetarian or vegan diet.',\n 'According to the theory of evolution it makes more sense that the egg preceded the chicken.

Relationship advice for example. Ive never been in a relationship so if I were to try and give an adult or anyone for that matter relationship advice it would make sense to tell me youre too youngyour opinion will changeyoull grow out of it. but when arguing about politics religion or any subject that really doesnt require experience to understand it better saying something like youre just a teen or I used to think like that is an excuse and it usually means you have nothing more to say but arent willing to lose this discussion to a stupid teen. personally Im unsurprisingly an atheist.

Feminists often try to silence womens criticisms of feminism by saying they have internalized misogyny. I dont believe this is the case. A lack of belief in the patriarchy can be caused by the lack of empirical evidence. Examples of misogyny and discrimination dont have to be ignored or excused as one with internalized misogyny would be expected to do because they do not necessarily prove the existence of a patriarchy nor institutional misogyny.',\n 'My logic basically stems from the idea of If you cant afford to have child you cant have a child. Let me explain.In my opinion if one parent wants to keep the child and the other doesnt then unless they can be proven unfit for parenting this includes financial instability then good for them go for it. The only time I could see child support being necessary is if they parent needs the extra money to support their children. But Im sorry you cant have a child if you cant support it and you sure as hell cant take the money from someone else regardless of their involvement in the childs creation. Obviously its a different story if they are splitting custody then an arrangement should be made about how the money should be split.If only the mother wants the child then she can have it and raise it by herself or with whomever she wants.If only the father wants the child then its up to the mother if she wants to have it and the forfeit custody to him after birth.',\n 'Many times in my life I have been helped out by a neighbor or business owner who left an unsecured or nopassword WiFi network.

Although there are horror stories about people being SWATted by those on their WiFi network I dont think the risks of that are statistically much higher than many other technology risks including using a guessable password like or browsing the Internet on library or Starbucks WiFi.

I also understand the underlying arguments for a man being on the hook for child support. However I believe that these arguments clash against each other and I feel that men should either be able to waive their financial obligations to their child or they should partake in the decision for the woman to get an abortion.Women should be the decision maker when it comes to getting an abortion because they should have control of their own bodiesThis is a perfectly valid point. In this argument the fetus is being treated as a part of the womans body and therefore the woman is free to make decisions without consideration for the wellbeing of the fetus and its future.Men should be on the hook for child support because we shouldnt be focused on the parents but rather the wellbeing of the childThis also makes perfect sense. Even if the parents are arguing the needs of the parents shouldnt be placed before the needs of the child.However if we take the argument that women should have control of their own bodies without consideration for the future of their fetus then it should also be right to say that men should have control of their own life without consideration for the future of their fetus.If we take the argument that the wellbeing of the child should come before the wellbeing of the parents then I also think that it is fair to say that a woman should not freely be able to choose whether to get an abortion without consideration for the wellbeing of the childs future.I find it extremely unfair that a woman who cannot financially or emotionally support a child has the right to have a kid because she has a right to control her own body but when it comes to men their life savings can be forcefully taken away because the future of the child should be placed before the rights of a man.Therefore I believe that men should either have abortion rights or the right to waive all financial obligations to his child while abortion is still an option.Note Im not trying to make this into a male vs. female thing.',\n 'Think about it.

It would be better to break it down further so that they are taxed on the first k on the next k and on the next k. Tax rate should be increased bit by bit as someones salary increases rather than having big jumps in tax rate. With a single formula there are no jumps and this leads to a fairer tax system.Heres a graph of a function which I came up with the very rich pay tax on their salary and those earning pay tax. Of course no one earns but this could easily be adjusted so that minimum wage earners pay and those slightly above minimum pay very little.One of Adam Smiths canons of taxation is that the tax system should be simple or understandable by the public.',\n 'Making something illegal doesnt make people want it any less there has only been a deterrent created. Stealing is illegal but that doesnt mean people dont want to steal that new thing that just hit the market or that thing they need but cant afford it just means that deterrent is more effective than their want of the thing.Likewise making a drug illegal does not magically make people not want to do that drug youve just made a deterrent. A deterrent isnt going to stop a heroin addict from getting his fix and overcoming withdrawal youve just changed where he gets it from and how much it costs and the risks associated with it. The user now has to go to a sketchy dealer the dealer has many tiers of other sketchy dealers all the way up to the cartel behind it all and that cartel is arguably more destructive than the drug itself and so is the war against the drug.Making abortion illegal isnt going to stop women from wanting an abortion youve just made it much less likely for them to get it done safely. If that woman was raped and she doesnt want to carry a reminder of her attacker she isnt going to care that some piece of paper says shes not allowed to do that shes going to find a some shady doctor with a revoked license to do it for her or shes going to take a coat hanger to herself.',\n 'Well while I was discussing the effects of feminism on another post a reddit user made a very good point in saying that femaleonly gyms and shelters are discriminatory.

I cant refute that its discriminatory of course because it is or at least I think it is. But I also believe its important for women to be and feel safe.

One reason I take this stance is because the newly released games are ectremely similar to their predecessors. There are few if any changes in gameplay and the basic level design for the most part remains the same. Even Advanced Warfare which seemed to promise the most novel changes was criticized for changing too little from its preceding games.Another reason for my opinion is that CoD doesnt really have anything astoundingly different from other games of the same genre.

Though it does this job well I believe it is this intent that causes it to be thoroughly not fun. Once of the board has been claimed even if the landholdings of all the players are about equal it is immediately obvious which player will lose based on who falls in anothers territory first and has to pay the incredulous tax. After that it is just a long fall into bankruptcy as eventually the player has to sell their property to others decreasing the chance that they can earn revenue while simultaneously increasing the chance that the others can profit from them.While this system would work in a quick game between to people monopoly is usually drawn out and played with players.',\n 'For the sake of this thread well exclude children with medically diagnosed learning disabilities IMO the knowledge and resource base for teaching said children is probably proportionate to the percentage they make up of the overall population.With a healthy child income neighborhood peers and teachers should be filtered through a responsible parents.

The truth is that most people when thinking of what is right and wrong do not decide on ethical principles and then reason outwards from those principles.

Instead I believe that we have to provide absolutely equal opportunities to everyone regardless of race stop asking for it in the paperwork and stop teaching the racial stereotypes to our youth.

That an absolute pacifist relies on others to commit violence for their own continued safety for example the subduing of a dangerous criminal by police forces may be violent and that any personal code which requires other persons to break said code in order to be followed cannot be moral.

People generally say that art is meant to be evocative and I understand this but when I cant tell it apart from something a toddler did I cant help but feel theres no work or meaning behind it beyond what Im imprinting purely because I expect there to be a meaning. I could imprint meaning onto anything that way that doesnt make it art. I dont feel anything when I look at these modern art pieces beyond questioning why its in the museum.

Its most obvious in cases where female teachers have sex with younger boys and peoples reaction to it mostly is NOICCE or I wish this happened to me my teacher was hot. Then when it happens with the sexes reversed the reaction is mostly That disgusting pedo deserves to get anally raped in jail and Oh that poor girl a terrible thing has been done to her.As a result of this you come across a lot of men who have been technically raped but who simply get over it extremely quickly despite feeling dirty violated etc as other guys around them just say stuff like You got laid dude quit complaining.

It is practiced through positive buying in that ethical products are favored or moral boycott that is negative purchasing and companybased purchasing.In practice we can view something like Green sourcing as an example of this behavior. You go to buy a given good and find two choices one of which is slightly more expensive than the other but promises that it was produced using Sustainable forestry or the like.

First of all given that the Green option is more expensive at no actual added utility to the enduser such consumerism is limited more to higherincome people who often buy not just for utility but for cosmetic luxury and an appearance of being environmentallyfriendly.',\n 'Since my town installed roundabouts Ive found that they are remarkably more efficient than the traffic lights and four way stops.Four way stops force all vehicles to come to a complete stop traffic lights force many vehicles to come to a complete stop before continuing movement roundabouts allow most vehicles to go through while maintaining inertia.Traffic lights also would appear to be the most expensive of the options considering building costs general upkeep paying engineers and installing vehicle detecting hardware.Traffic lights also seem to have an increased risk of high speed accidents because drivers will not always have to slow down and pay attention.

They know full well what theyre getting into.Bringing Christs message to North Korea? Jail.Want to change Irans policies concerning women attending sports events? Jail.People who do this are either naive fools or are religious fools. They bring potential harm to their home countries by providing a bargaining chip and advantage to the imprisoning governments.Western governments need to make it clear to travelers to these countries that if they intentionally break laws or provoke the system theyll face dire consequences with no assistance from their home government.Western visitors to Iran and North Korea who knowingly provoke the regime should expect severe punishment and no assistance from their home government.',\n 'You may have seen recent viral video that aims to fight street harassment Hours of Walking in NYC as a Woman While there are some instances of harassment in that video I think that calling compliments and greetings harassment serves nobody. It is not respectful to real victims of harassment because it trivializes the issue.. It disrupts normal social dynamics between people.. It is not in the interest of women that want to meet somebody that men are being discouraged to approach them.. It will not deter creepy guys from harassing women because apparently they dont have any problem even with real harassment.Radical feminists think that approaching a woman you dont know should automatically be characterized as harassment.',\n 'Nobody likes having to memorize dozens of passwords and people usually just end up saving their passwords to a document or emailing it to themselves so they can remember it later which defeats the purpose of trying to keep someones account safe. Instead of forcing people to use a character password with mandatory upper case numbers symbols etc they should give the customer more freedom to use any password they want. Brute forcing is not an issue as long as you limit log in attempts to something reasonable that wouldnt affect the user like . As long as you temporarily block login attempts from that certain IP after a number of incorrect guesses any password over characters would take an ungodly amount of time to crack.Theres no added benefit to a longer and more complicated password requirement that is worth the hassle to the user and cannot also be achieved with limited login attempts.',\n 'Now Im not saying that actors are not talented and that it is not difficult to act out difficult scenes.

Heath Ledger was another example. Robin Williams too would not have been thought as much more than a comedian until given the right opportunity. Or Will Smith.',\n 'This isnt a strongly held view of mine and Im very open to changing it but its something Ive thought for quite a while now.Basically I dont see why there exist separate mens and womens bathrooms. The following are my thoughts Theres no reason a woman couldnt use a bathroom which also had a urinal and theres no reason a man couldnt use a stall in place of a urinal. Were just in there to use the bathroom. If youre using a stall theres no way to tell the gender of another person anyway so whats it matter if theyre standing or sitting? And if a guys using a urinal whats it matter?',\n 'First off I want this to be USAspecific simply because it is the only government I have lived under maybe if there is some really good counterpoint with another nation I would hear it but I am mainly looking for answers related to the US government. Okay Im not suggesting the removal of government lets get that out first. I know that the real purpose of a government is to protect certain values that a society believes are rights of the citizens it is the governments job to ensure that the food is safe or that some random business allows for equal opportunity I understand that. Heres my general point. There is not a single example of a government organization working with greater efficiency than a corporate or privatesector competitor.',\n 'First let me make clear that I am not saying that laziness is a virtue. I work moderately hard always take my job seriously and deliver the required results.But I also take pride in achieving as much as possible with as little effort as possible. I am always searching for opportunities to automate tedious and repetitive parts of my job and I try to completely avoid taking on projects that have a low return compared to their workload.Out of principle I never work more longer than a hour week unless its a real emergency.So far Ive done OK. Im an engineer and most of my jobs are year contracts for large corporations. Im not high up the corporate ladder but the salary is high enough to cover all my material needs plus save about for retirement. I know that if I worked a lot harder I would have the chance to be promoted to a director position but I dont see the point.',\n 'There are two parts to this view and I will award deltas if you can change either of them. The first is that money in courts is a fundamental miscarriage of justice. When I see cases where a drunk kid kills people but their rich parents get them off with their crack team of lawyers or a powerful corporation destroys a regular person or small business with a costly court case on extremely weak grounds because the small business cant afford to fight back I am sickened. Equality in the eyes of the law is in my opinion the single most important part of our society and in the current system the rich and the poor are not equal in the eyes of the law.The second part of my view is that a good solution to this problem is to require that both sides in a lawsuit or court case contribute equally to their own legal team and their opponents. Ive thought long and hard about this and this is the best thing I can come up with.',\n 'Simple as the title I believe that if someone is guilty of a serious crime against another rape murder child abuse etcetc the victim or the family of the victim should be legally allowed to torture the guilty party as part of the punishment.

Unless you live on a farm or directly hunt your meat not a single animal is saved.',\n 'If you find yourself uninformed about representatives or issues you should not nor should you be encouraged to vote. This to me seems common sense yet in many or most elections people are attempting to get people to actively vote who otherwise would not such as teachers giving extra credit for voting or businesses offering incentives to employees who vote. I understand people should be encouraged to understand the issue at hand and to research representatives however people who do not should not be encouraged to vote. The reasoning behind this is simply that these choices should not be made at a spur of the moment or without conviction as then we get representatives voted in who hold no qualifications but who the voter may have heard of once or twice. Thank you for your time and I am honestly willing to change my view.',\n 'When sharing a bag of candy between friends a socially conscious sweet tooth reaches into the bag for a handfull and eats what he gets.

Ive never voted in an election. I think the electoral college system sucks balls. I think elections are won one of two ways based on geographic party affiliation i.e. local elections in red states are going to consistently choose the Republican and nothing will change it or based on marketing who runs better ads who has better buzz words like Change and Hope who can come off as the better peopleperson. Neither of these reasons have dick to do with policy.',\n 'I have been struggling to find the meaning in anything lately. If someone were to talk to me I assume they would classify me as an atheist as I do not think that there is a continuation of any sort after death.

For example why does it matter whether someone acts justly and is a good person versus acting vile and offensive? Im not saying that we should all be dicks to each other but what I am saying is that in the long run there will be no evidence of someone acting either way.',\n 'So I recognize that global warming is real and happening. And I recognize that human activity appears to be the main driver of it. But I dont think the consequences will be as dire as are portrayed for humanity. In the following most of my source material is going to come from the IPCC which is I think a fairly good source for data on this and if anything has an institutional bias in the direction of warning of dire consequences.There are fourthree avenues that I think are of primary concern Sea level rise.

Heavy use also tends to lead to a certain amount of dependency where the user has difficulty quitting even if they decide they want to.',\n 'This stemmed from my discussion with my friend regarding the Hungarian internet tax. The claim is that internet access should be pretty much like utilities if I dont use the internet that often why should I pay more?

And finally if this tax was set real low would it still be reasonable to implement it?',\n 'In my opinion only the Persian invasion of Greece has had a bigger macroeffect on world history events and culture than WWI.The failed invasion of Greece set the ground work for all of western civilization up to and including the modern era.But I also believe that WWI has had more far reaching consequences worldwide than anything since the said invasion of Greece up to and including today.As as aside Id consider the Mongols as the third biggest event. that these arent the two biggest human events in written history.',\n 'Or more laymens terms We can stop companies from making billion percent profit for virtually no reason and without being communist as they say.

Will it hurt me at all?What about all those health nuts on allfruit diets or whatever? Shouldnt their blood be running thicker than molasses?It just seems like the most counterintuitive thing to me fruits which are high in sugar are also generally considered one of the healthiest things you can possibly be eating or feed to your children or whatever.So whats the deal?

Not having child is objectively a great decision economically timewise etc.',\n 'Im not saying that U.S. democracy or any specific democracy is the best or better than any other other government but rather that democracy or the idea that every individual should matter and get a say through some kind of vote and that public officials should be held responsible for their actions with that vote is the best political system to date for preventing corruption and promoting social equality and liberty.Sure there is a nearly endless list of democracys shortcomings and failures and the U.S. is an especially good example of how tyranny and atrocity can continue or even worsen under a supposedly democratic government. However I believe these are offset and outnumbered by the tyranny and atrocities committed under nondemocratic governments.When I say this I mean that I believe comparing modern and past democracies to modern and past dictatorships and monarchies throughout history will yield the conclusion that the quality of life in a democracy is substantially better for most people and that as more people are given franchise the better and better it gets. Conversely if for example the U.S. had been a oneparty dictatorship for the past years atrocities such as chattel slavery genocide of indigenous peoples and unwarranted global intervention would be that much worse if imagining such is even possible.I want to clarify that I am using the U.S. as my main example because thats where I am also I think it is a good example of a particularly controversial example of democracy.I believe that one of the biggest problems with American democracy to date is the ambivelence people have towards democracy. Judging even just from the posts on this sub many are incredibly disappointed with democracy and will even go as far as to say it is obsolete or just a bad idea in the first place. When we stop having faith in democracy we stop having faith in the people and ourselves and necessarily cede our power to others.',\n 'Revenge porn can be extremely hurtful there is no doubt about that. But so can other behaviors by resentful lovers such as gossip cheating backstabbing betrayal and financial exploitation.

By allowing all eligible citizens to access firearms you neutralise this disadvantage women have. By preventing all eligible citizens from legally accessing firearms you have a disproportionate affect upon women.

I rarely see fat professional tennis players but I have seen a few somewhat overweight snooker and darts players.

I have spoken with a few people about this in the hopes that they would convince me that its ok to continue eating meat but so far the arguments have been entirely unconvincing.Id like to preemptively address some arguments that I do not find compelling..

If a procedure is expensive unavailable or illegal in a persons country of residence it could be anything from cosmetic surgery to various dental procedures to abortions and euthanasia an alternative is to fly to a country which provides the service under more desirable conditions. In my opinion government regulation of this industry constitutes a violation of personal liberty undermines the economic growth of the prospective destination countries and inflates the price of domestic healthcare by forcibly eliminating foreign competition.Examples of regulation include limiting travel to government approved zones countries etc limiting the kinds of treatment allowed e.g. banning certain procedures deemed to dangerous or perhaps banning travel for procedures which are illegal in the country like abortions or euthanasia making the buying of insurance to cover the procedure compulsory and so on.

My initial position was that until you begin to formulate and test hypotheses what you are doing isnt science. For instance coming up with ideas being rigorous and being an expert does not make you a scientist. This is not to say that ideation rigor and expertise are not neccessary just that you do not have science with without something to test and the means to test it.As an aside another concern I had was that we give credence to the creation of ideas without the process then you are labeling a process science with its associated authority when it should not have that authority.

It can be extremely difficult to deduce the truth for a suspect.

In this sense patriarchy may be a natural tradition. This does not imply that patriarchy is good or justified though.The reason I think patriarchies outperformed matriarchies is that primitive societies were in no position to compensate for the potential distortions in judgement caused by the menstrual cycle of women. PMS in particular has unpredictable psychological consequences for women. On the average it seems likely that men would be more consistent decision makers than women.Although men do not have better judgement than women do on average a man of good judgement is more likely to be consistent than a woman of good judgement due to the psychological effects of the menstrual cycle on the woman.And to reiterate I am aiming at an explanation for patriarchy with reference to the efficient cause not at a justification for patriarchy.',\n 'For a long time I followed Ron Pauls reasoning on the war in Iraq that we were doing more harm than good and that bringing our troops home would reduce threats of terrorism and save us money in the long run.So we did that ISIS formed and terror threats are much greater than they were before.

The reason they hate us so much is not because we were over there but because we support Israel their number enemy.

Similarly at my dorm last year they would run unannounced fire drills as often as once a month it was so common and the odds of fire so low that generally people just assumed correctly that it wasnt real and sometimes didnt even leave their rooms.

In particular food stamps give people a debit card with which they can buy nonprepared food from grocery stores and other food retailers.I think the restriction on what can be bought with these benefits should be repealed and that the recipients should decide for themselves what they want to buy.The restriction on buying only food is paternalistic and reduces the range of options available to poor families. Changing the benefit to a cash transfer will improve the welfare of poor families while saving the government money on their administration of the program. The rules requiring purchasing only food seem designed around ideas that poor people are irresponsible and prone to bad decision making and that the government knows better than them what they need. While some people would make worse decisions with the money it does not seem fair to greatly reduce the value of these benefits for the large majority of recipients who are conscientious people in extremely difficult circumstances.But these programs became the way they are for a reason so maybe Im missing something.',\n 'No I dont think that all people diagnosed with depression should just deal with it.

I love going to church on Christmas Eve night and singing Joy to the World and praising the Lord for sending us our eventual savior. Apart from religion Christmas to me means family and every year I get to spend time with both sides of my family.

I dont think anyone would label them as athletic or incredibly fit nor would anyone say they are obese.',\n 'When my cousin was and I went to her house I was absolutely appalled that she addressed her mother by her first name instead of mom. Calling your parents mom or dad isnt just a sign of respect it is sign of love as well. Mom and Dad are titles that parents have earned by having and raising kids. Parenting is an extremely hard job and parents deserve respect.

Very few I imagine. On the other hand the parties that you most remember best are the ones where someone is doing something unusual and hilarious due to the amount of alcohol they have had.Now I had this conversation with a friend who argued the opposite bringing up the point that the person or people who drink too much may eventually become a burden to the whole party if theyre sick. I however think that they would not be that much of a burden as you can give them some water and leave them alone plus theyve probably spiced the party up with their antics for two hours beforehand.Basically I believe a party where everyone is too drunk is much more desirable than a party where everyone drinks sensibly even if it results in sickness.Side note an argument that references health will not .',\n 'Many schools including my friends but luckily not mine have placed bans on using Wikipedia as a source of info.

Does this mean starting everyone from a same footing which would involve compensating for background and genetic discrepancies or simply applying the same provision to everyone?

It probably takes more athleticism to run a competitive marathon time or endure an MMA fight. I will say that I cant immediately think of a more strategic sport than football more on that in a bit. Though football isnt the greatest in all three categories it requires a great deal of each.Skill is probably the weakest of the three criteria for football but football is unique in the number and variety of skills required to make a football team function each position has to do things the others dont.

Contemporary Christianity when followed based on exact instructions rather than its spirit that is general guidelines and recurring themes which are presented throughout the Holy Bible instructs its practitioners to kill maim and torture anyone who happens to violate its codes.

Similarly I do a job to gain money that I can spend on things that I enjoy good feelings and paying bills avoiding the bad feelings of being sued and going to jail.Apart from when one is in the grip of a strong mood like anger which I dont want to discuss because it does not involve EDIT considered actions it seems to me that this is always the case?Can anyone change my view by coming up with examples of times when people do things and they dont expect to get a good feeling out of it or avoid a bad feeling?Thanks!',\n 'After the Fukushima meltdown there has been a massive controversy about nuclear technology this is ignoring the fact that since the end of the cold war reactor RampD and research have been stagnating.

They might be referred to as survivors if their lives legitimately came into jeopardy if they were held at gunpoint if they were severely physically assaulted etc. but most instances of rape unwanted sexual advances isolated to a single instance do not come attached with a serious possibility of death. Rape is definitely one of the worst things that can happen to somebody but I think that survivor suggests that what happened to them was on the same level as living through a genocidal campaign a terminal illness a plane crash or something else of the sort. The former is bad but the latter are almost certainly worse.

AlSham is itself an Arabic term which can be translated as either greater Syria or the Levant the latter of which is why ISIL is also an accurate translation.The problem is that in the English language media radio TV newspapers internet journalism ISIS is translated as The Islamic State of Iraq and Syria which is not a particularly good translation and it minimizes the international threat posed by the group.The Levant actually covers a huge swath of the western Middle East including Cyprus Israel Jordan Lebanon Palestine Syria and parts of Egypt and Turkey.When media use the term ISIS they are effectively saying that the threat of this group is limited to the two countries Iraq and Syria. On the other hand the term ISIL is slightly more accurate and also serves as a warning that this terrorist group poses a far more broadbased threat to the whole region.Therefore it is more accurate and useful to refer to the group as ISIL rather than ISIS. ..I want to thank everyone who participated and I will continue to respond to comments as they appear though not necessarily as quickly.',\n 'I believe that there is no such thing as a timeless movie book or play and so on.

It portrays its authority in the form of a supernatural power who bears stateimposed American values and fights the evil. Disney movies portray the kings and queens as noble and just people that should be trusted and revered without a question. We are taught to dualize things into evil and good so do these movies but in a very exagerated form.

The formalities that surround it arose out of a necessity to know who is supposed to be responsible for which kids which people are supposed to inherit the property of diseased people and so on.For several thousand years it has been the duty of clergy and religious institutions to formalize monogamous relationships into marriage which is still the case in several countries. Only recently with the advent of suprareligious states brought about by the French Revolution has it been made into a secular issue.It wasnt something that people only started doing after someone voted for a law to bureaucratize it but the other way round it was something that was good and only then did states decide to appropriate it for their own sake.The state doesnt regulate marriage because its good for people. It does so because it is good for itself.

You have dug that hole and fallen below societys status quo on drug use. If you then manage to maintain sobriety you will then be considered in line with status quo again arguably lower even then since you became addicted in the first place.Some people stay sober their entire lives and are never given accolades or congratulations. The same should logically apply to former addicts. Saying I havent funded my crack habit for a year is roughly equivalent to saying I take adequate care of my pets or I wear clothes in public it is conforming to the baseline of status quo as well as the law and shouldnt be considered with admiration or praise.',\n 'Before I get burned at the stake let me set a few facts out. Im a dude who subscribes to rmensrights and agrees with of the common opinions expressed there. My stance comes from a viewpoint that lies between the women need to look out for themselves and dont enable rape culture women should dress and behave as they please viewpoints. I think any person should be able to go where they please and do what they please without worrying about having their personal liberty infringed on.No one should have to watch their glass like a hawk and their friends glass and make sure theyre not alone and make sure they dont drink too much for fear that someone will take their lowered guard as a chance to sexually assault them. No one should live in fear of ANYTHING. Its plain old not healthy.So that brings us to teach men not to rape! While Im not a rapist Im aware that a very very tiny portion of the population are able and willing to force themselves on others by means of drugs or good ol muscle.How do you teach that tiny portion to not rape without demonizing a large portion of the model citizens who are an example of what the solution looks like?Ill be actively replying for as long as I can.',\n 'Monogamy by definition restricts a person from fulfilling sexual desires outside their relationship.

Relationships are tedious time consuming and even though Ive had a fair share of them they pretty much always end with one getting a broken heart. This could all have been prevented by being not being in a relationship from the beginning which is kind of hard unless youre asexual because its pretty much human nature.

It should be eradicated to the point of only increasing or decreasing based off the economy at that point in time. As of now its the federal government stepping in and increasing the state MW. It should be there as a measurement of the inflation of currency and state of the market and to avoid any unfair affairs that would ensue based off a complete ridding of the MW.

You get the idea.Sure those movements make people feel better about themselves but it makes them content with who they are thinking theres nothing wrong with it and not try to improve.

According to a poll used for an anime Family Feud in an anime convention at least make friends in a day convention with people of similar interests. Thats absurd.I cant speak for fat acceptance but as a previous nerd with no social skills it was the feeling of rejection that made me improve and push myself to hone my social skills.',\n 'Hi guys.Firstly I will be as openminded as possible here. I will listen to anything you say and hopefully you can change my view.Right Ive never done it myself but I fully support groups like the Animal Liberation Front ALF which release animals from places if abuse using any nonviolent methods. This means they will only damage property and never harm or injure humans or other animals.From videos I have seen of dogs minks or monkeys etc being allowed out of a cage and seeing grass and seeing the sky for the first time of their lives I have realised that they too have feelings and emotions and caging a human or other animal up for their whole lives is torture and should be totally illegal.Especially incidents like at the university of California several years ago when monkeys had their eyes sewed up from birth I believe are disgusting and I believe that the ALF liberators involved in the rescue are heroes. They changed the lives of each and every one of the animals freed.I believe that these rescues are just as moral as the destruction of concentration camps or the freeing of slaves in the past note I am not comparing the events simply the rescues which took place and their morality.So .',\n 'I am vehemently not a racist.

Romantic relationship is defined as a mutual agreement of exclusivity in dating and being referred to as together.The first point I have is that in a purely practical sense dating should be seen from a breadth first approach.

It seems to require much less thought and effort than actually coming up with a way to bring the song to a close and its highly unsatisfying to me.The fade out is usually during several repetitions of the chorus which in and of itself seems like lazy songwriting. If the song has said all it has to say repeating the chorus over and over again isnt going to improve or enhance it at all. Its just filler and I suspect thats often how its used to flesh out a song enough to make it long enough to play on the radio. Alternately I suppose that the purpose could be to keep that catchy hook in peoples heads and keep them wanting more which is good marketing but does not necessarily make it a better song.For another thing that wouldnt fly in any other art form.',\n 'A common argument for a flat tax rate is that a progressive tax rate removes the incentive for people to work hard to become rich.

I see in multiple news sources where people have stated that the footage appeared to cast aspersions on the dead man or is a form of character assassination.

This would mean that anyone saying Im not going to explain these people have done it far better than I ever could arent necessarily wrong in saying that but not to attempt it is anti debate. This is also true because the reading of these materials creates a time delay in which the materials must be found time and then have that time put into reading them which the suggester of the materials is essentially using as a shield. For whatever reason they have improperly entered debate either do not fully understand their position or are too tired to carry finish and are now trying to put you off the scent rather than simply improve everyones understanding by summarising the argument.',\n 'As horrible as it sounds given the fact that Gazans elected Hamas which was a group that actively called for the destruction of the state of Israel and actively pursues this they are literally saying they want a war with Israel...

I understand from a legal standpoint that punishing the civilians for wanting a war is probably not correct but when it comes to taking responsibility for their actions... dont they deserve this?Note This view is horrible and I really want to change it.

Coming from a very competitive environment I have definitely become used to the stresses associated with comparing myself to others. While I do not think it is the best for my mental health I do think it gives me a massive edge over others.

I suppose that some vegetarians may just not want to take part in eating meat themselves and dont really care about the bigger picture but that seems like a shallow and pointless reason to be a vegetarian to me.

Im currently in college and I know many high school athletes that use PEDs and it is even more prevalent in college so if you believe this is a problem it is certainly not being solved by policing only the upper echelons of sports.I say these things not because I want Steroids legalized I would never do them I am an entirely natural athlete using only vitamins and whey protein.Some BroScience for Levity',\n 'A TV series is inherently better when watched in the original language.

When he reinvents himself the only way he knows how to create a public identity is through branding thats why all of Batmans gadgets are so heavily batthemed and in the earlier versions of Batman even had a Bat prefix.Throughout the history of Batman the hero has refused to kill the villain and instead has him institutionalized or put in jail from which the villain the Joker Scarecrow etc. inevitably escapes and returns to terrorize the city again giving Batman an excuse to continue fighting crime. Everybody thinks Batman is really cool but I think its horrible because Batman is a symbol for corporate America bombarding us with hypercharged caricatures of our culture and selling it to us as their brand.

Contrary the domination way through defeating all enemies makes perfect sense all my enemies are defeated no rebellion I am now basically king of everything. The diplomatic way also makes sense since you can be made a world leader through the world congress. The cultural victory makes your civilization a utopia but just because I have a utopia doesnt mean everyone will want to make me king it means the cities I control will want me to keep ruling but when I die they might fight amongst themselves for who will replace TheFishlord the great XVII but through world domination my civilization could stand the test of time by pushing down all insurgency since I tend to be an autocracy.',\n 'My argument is simple.

God is supposed to be allpowerful meaning that rebellion is futile.So were left with only two possible explanations. Either heaven is not a utopia and some people find Gods unchallenged authoritarian tyranny a questionable system of governance. God is not omnipotent or at the very least Lucifer is also phenomenally powerful.We can extrapolate from the incongruities in the logic of the information weve been given that God is clearly lying to us and either inflating the desirability of heaven or the measures of his own power or both.

The majority of my knowledge comes from a few Super Meat Boy speed runners and Dark Souls speed running. It seems a common tactic in the speed running community to use tricks in the game to quickly get ahead. This is exactly what you would expect from someone trying to finish the game as fast as possible however often times these tricks can cause the player to completely skip a large portion of the game. My main example would be whats referred to as the Brownie Skip in Super Meat Boy.',\n 'I often hear people discussing gun control legislation as common sense seemingly as a way of getting out of having to actually explain the logic behind them. To me the most significant manifestation of this issue is the tremendous amount of support for legislation that would disallow anyone diagnosed with a mental illness to own a firearm. At first thought such a measure seems to make sense. Surely this legislation would make it such that dangerous mentally ill people cannot obtain firearms making the world a safer place.But consider this.

However hes in way too many scenes to the point that he just gets annoying.CPO does nothing to drive the story forward. I feel that you could actually remove him from all of the films and the plots wouldnt really change that much. The only thing hes good at is language interpretations but he doesnt fill that role often enough to justify him getting so much screen time.If CPO was in fewer scenes he would be a decent character but the fact that hes in so many and the fact that hes actually kind of useless really damages our enjoyment of the character. Who do you think is the worst character in the Star Wars movies and why is that character worse than CPO?',\n 'First to the issue of consent. Can an year old give consent? that is almost a definite no.

Of course this view must hold that those even those younger than those that can speak can give consent but I wont go there in this as I will get a bunch of hate mail and witchhunts as is common in western societys irrational hatred of anyone defending the pedos.

It would also be good for the environment as I believe animal rearing contributes hugely to global warming perhaps justifying a meat free life. Equally it would free up huge amounts of crops that could feed needy people ? or assorted others.

Generosity is defined as showing a readiness to give more of something as money or time than is strictly necessary or expected. From what I know Id say that in richer circles donating to something andor someone is in fact expected and that you may be perceived badly if you dont donate. Giving above a certain amount can serve as cheap advertising for those donating and serves to increase their reputation with the public. The tax benefits available for those who donate at large amounts can offset the cost of donating and I believe even provide an incentive to give in the first place.',\n 'When you have a slow network you dont improve it by upgrading the fastest nodes.

In an ideal situation where I could see him coming I know Im taller and stronger than him so all I would need to do is brace my legs so that when its charging at me it doesnt tackle me to the ground. I could probably manhandle a dog of that size or punch it in the face or pull on its fur or shove my fist down its throat or do something in the heat of the moment to disable the dog. The only real threat from the dog is the teeth right? so as long as you dont get shocked from him biting you all you need to do is keep a tall upright dominant position and wrestle the dog to the ground and induce submission death knock out exhaustion etc.Now this is assuming that the dog doesnt have a handler who is also after me in which case yeah Id be screwed.',\n 'Many people talk about how they have hope.

Just because you exist doesnt mean that you deserve the money that someone else earned through working more or working harder than you did. This currently exists to a much lesser extent with welfare but thats unfortunately necessary because some people are trying to find a job or just cant support a family which if they knew that they wouldnt make enough money to support one anyways then they shouldnt have had kids.Instead of just giving people tax money why dont we put money towards infrastructure that helps people make money through working? i.e. schools for education factories for uneducated workers etc.Also when the U.S is in trillion in debt I dont think the proper investment with our money is to just hand it to people.

They build up a huge fanbase releasing free albums. Then the lead singer has an existential crisis dissolves the band and takes down the website making it impossible for new fans to find their albums.I believe that the bands fans are completely justified in making and distributing copies of the bands albums since the original creator has refused to make them available and has shown no indication that they will ever be available again and in fact has indicated the exact opposite.I believe that in contrast a company like Disney who has a track record of pulling and rereleasing their movies every few years for marketing purposes shouldnt lose their protection.

I would consider myself more independent compared to other teenage girls however I believe that research is required before making decisions such as birth control.I believe that teenage girls are first of all not mature enough to have a well researched or experience say in their sex lives. Their parents have gone through decisions like these and if teenage girls do not have the ability to trust their parents then they do not have the ability to trust their own decisions. Especially since birth control involves potential health risks that teenage girls may not be aware of increasingly validates the point that teenage girls should talk to their parents before deciding whether or not they should take birth control pills.Another point is that I believe if teens were given the ability to take birth control without the consent of their parents they would be increasingly prone to chances of obtaining sexually transmitted diseases. To prevent this teenagers should talk to their parents about possible health risks involved with taking birth control pills.However being a teenage girl myself I feel that my opinions are not well researched and do not consider the statuses of other teenage girls within their families.',\n 'What someone else masturbates to and how much they do it as long as it doesnt involve disturbing others i.e. masturbating in a public place is their business.

For example masturbating to someones picture on Facebook as long as the person doing it does not disturb the other person by telling them about it is perfectly acceptable.

This makes sense in that the Genie requires that his freedom be wished for in order for him to be free.The problem with this is that the Genie was able to get himself Aladdin and company outside of the Cave of Wonders without it counting as one of Aladdins wishes. In this case it seems the Genie has unlimited power but is constrained to fulfill whatever wishes his master desires which brings us to...Scenario Genie can do what he wants but must follow his masters wishes.lets also assume that the Genie cannot free himselfIn this case the Genie lives his life as he chooses but just wants freedom so he doesnt have to fulfill a random guys wishes.The problem with this then is when Aladdin was handcuffed and drowning why did Genie require Aladdin to wish for himself to be saved? Why wouldnt the Genie just save him using his own relatively free will?In either of these situations why didnt the Genie just strike up a deal with Aladdin that if Aladdin wished for the Genies freedom instantly once the Genie was free the Genie could just provide Aladdin with wishes as if he were the Genies master?This is something that is such a critical part in the plot of the movie that really needs clarifying for me to enjoy the film fully.',\n 'This is something I used to go back and forth on with an ex.

What this ends up doing is it makes it so the few people in the population of the country are eligible to run because they are the few who can raise the funds required for costly campaigns. Even after we have been informed about the candidates running we are forced as a nation to come together and debate for ourselves what we think about the information given. If politicians and their staff were to instead talk directly to the people through forums such as AMAs then we could essentially cut out speculation and hear what we are voting for directly from the mouths of the politicians themselves.The first thing that comes to mind might be millions of people collecting to forums would take an excessive amount of resources to cater to.Yes that is true.',\n 'This centers around the current situation surrounding disposable cutlery in Western nations wherein we spend precious resources on making oneuse plastic cutlery which is disposed of immediately after a meal. This is also a big issue in eastern Asia where disposable chopsticks are consumed at an alarming rate.I think we should return to the system of medieval Europe where people brought a knife for eating wherever they went and while eating out there would be no expectation for the host to provide cutlery. This could be done easily with either a hybrid of a forkknifespoon or simply bringing several tools for the job. A nondisposable pair of chopsticks would be even easier to bring with you too.This would also be a boon for hygiene as every person would be responsible for keeping their set of cutlery clean preferably with some type of paper napkin to rub over with after a meal.A common counterargument I get is about where one would carry the cutlery especially for men who tend to not bring handbags with them. But this is a non issue as there are are several foldable sporks on the market even today.I look forward to hearing possible counterarguments to my view.',\n 'Hey . So far when it comes to changing my view you guys are so I figured Id post another opinion of mine.In general I am pretty accepting of other peoples views but I absolutely cannot stand pacifists.

Anything else is unfair.This is true regardless of how I feel about any particular law. I want all corporations to supply birth control but since the Supreme Court has ruled that some dont I believe none should. Since the Hobby Lobby decisions applies to corporations its now creating unfair competition because religious companies can save money on insurance.Laws that affect actual people are even more important because thats discrimination.

I took the stance that during the Civil Rights era Martin Luther King Jr. was more successful than Malcolm X because he took a more tempered approach presenting arguments that simply could not be denied and using tactics like sitins to prove the brutality of the oppression by the racists of the era rather than using offensive tactics to get the oppressors to back down in submission. If I recall correctly my friend argued that he was successful because he did not in fact take a tempered approach but instead that his tactics were very inyourface citing his quote that freedom cannot be attained by simply asking. NB I pretty much just talking about civil rights here. Political and economic inequality are somewhat different issuesHeres a basic outline of my position and the opposing oneMy belief Equality for any oppressed group can only logically happen if the enough of the oppressors realize their fault and change Ignorance breeds intolerance and therefore education breeds tolerance In the case of the Feminist movement activists should work to make society aware of problems and favor hard data to rhetoric not that rhetoric isnt useful Youre better served by telling someone why theyre wrong than by berating them Criticize the action rather than the person.',\n 'I will explain in anecdotal format how I came to this conclusionI was in my companys office and was called by a restricted phone number and answered accordingly due to the fact that it could have been important.

However there is an aspect to my orientation I am going to avoid directly mentioning in hopes of keeping this topic on topic that means that I can fairly safely say I already experience as much orientationphobia that a bisexual would or more so the argument of the existence of biphobia will not be compelling.So yeah.

Based on the extensive research Ive done I know that chemical engineers with my credentials should make between KK a year.I make it through rounds of interviews and the company offers me the job and says theyll pay me K a year. Based on my research I know that number is unfair so I negotiate until I reach somewhere between KK. If the company doesnt agree to pay me what I believe to be the industry standard and what a man would make in that position I walk. Or I accept the lower pay knowing that it is my fault Im making less than what Im worth.Women who complain that they arent making equal pay to men either didnt do their proper research when applying for the job didnt negotiate their salaries effectively or are too lazy to leave and find another job which pays them what theyre worth.For what its worth I am a woman. !',\n 'Im not really big into sports but I think that having leagues distributed by height could be great for basketball. I always enjoyed college games over professional games due to a greater focus on teamwork and strategy as opposed to personalities doing massive feats. While some even the majority of people will always prefer the NBAs entertainment value there is little to be lost by offering the vertically challenged a chance to strut their stuff.Much like boxing while many want to see the heavy hitters engaged in a mighty battle some appreciate the agility and and timing of the lower weight classes. These lower classes are every bit if not more talented but hardly stand a chance when pitted against the heaviest men in the sport. I think basketball also loses many talented players due to the lack of heightclasses.Only reason I couldnt see this happening is funding but for community and school sports it should be a nobrainer.',\n 'In order for a child to be sucessful heshe needs to be raised in a stable household economically socially and emotionally.

Why do I think this is racist?An individual in this scenario is outright say heshe does not wish to speak to someone on the basis of race and were to assume heshe will ignore comments from individuals belonging to whatever group heshe is excluding.

Its almost terrifying to me that PURE marketing has made a product as terrible as American football so central to American culture.

I am even more astounded by how fast churches are capable of taking children and within a week theyve got the child radically supporting an adopted belief system.I thought to myself Either Christianity is so true that a good preacher can convert masses out of how obvious the belief system is or there is some sort of fallacy going on here.Heres what might be happeningTake this first set of statements.

See Female character model controversies Mirrors Edge Assassins Creed etc. Jobs dominated by men engineering blue collar jobs etc. are being encouraged more and more for females to join.

This is where we either became flawed or died from a perfect human depending on the theology.But many years later God sent His only Son Jesus to spread His word and ultimately to be sacrificed to pay for the sins that came after Adam and Even and including that ultimate sin.If Jesus is accepted to be part of the trinity then it has been said that God sent himself to earth to sacrifice himself to himself so that he can forgive us for the act that Adam and Eve did did he forsee this action?.For this I am narrowing it to two specific views.',\n 'Valeri Polyakov the human to live longest in space was there for months.

By empirical questions I mean questions that depend more strongly on experimental evidence than on reflection on everyday experience or our knowledge of history.There is an exception to my impatience with empirical issues which is the debate over the theory of evolution.

Beds couches armchairs dining room tables and chairs refrigerators washing machines and other large furniture and appliances should be considered part of the house condo or apartment and included in the price when you buy or sell it. They dont belong on a moving van.We should view upgrades to our couches the same way we see remodeling a kitchen.

For example separate queues for people who need different amounts of service time and the like items or less checkouts.but of the time a simple queue is the best way to determine who gets served first not a scrum of people crowding around the service elbowing their way forward with no regard for politeness or etiquette this is the kind of systems which promote different values for who gets served first values like being pushy or being physically attractive values which I believe pale in comparison to was there first.This is a big problem in two places bars and everywhere apart from England a joke I assure you though a pointed one. Bars get a small pass because I understand that standing behind someone is a really hard concept to grasp when you are drunk but less sarcastically there are space concerns and barsnightclubs seem to be a place where politeness goes to die.As for the second half I just dont understand why cant people understand that a disordered scrum just isnt fair or dignified and reduces us to piglets suckling at their mothers teat.Sorry for being a little overly British but I have just returned from a three month stint travelling around Europe and this point really struck me.',\n 'Without getting specific as to which ones are worse or denying the necessity of antivirus software in general for you know viruses.

He argues that while minorities should be able to use these words the rest of the population is not equipped to understand why they cant use these words and that When a white kid sees his favorite rapper use the word he assumes that despite the historical significance of its oppressive qualities its now fine to say the nword.

Since the invention of the internet many of the questions that we test become obsolete. For high school exams memorizing specific dates names functions etc. are fairly pointless when you could look it up in seconds.

Anyway it goes without saying that we couldnt eat them all so we decided to give away some to a homeless person. Anyway I told him that we bought the cheeseburgers partly to kinda smalltalk and partly so he understood why we would just hand him a bag of food and let him take what he wanted...But later when we talked my friends told me that they thought it was kinda douchbaggy to tell him that we bought that many cheeseburgers because I was implying that we had more money than him and that we had the luxury of being able to buy as much food as we wanted. Also he could be thinking we could have just gived him the money..But my point was that just by giving him anything implies we have more money than him and by wearing fancy cloth of a total value much greater than the cheeseburgers was also saying that we have more resources than him.

I also believe the more controversial point that religions nowadays although less so as organizations but rather by individuals or small groups attempt to and sometimes succeed in halting scientific progress.

A reliance on statistical and probabilistic models in soft science whereas there is generally more concrete and directly observable evidence in hard science.. soft science is generally at a higher level of abstraction than hard sciences with physics being at the bedrock of all science ascending from there in turn chemistry biology neuroscience psychology sociology etc.I wish to argue against these distinctions in turn.Firstly in quantum physics many probabilistic and statistical models are necessitated because of the uncertainty principle. If this distinction is valid then quantum physics is a soft science.Secondly even before physics we have postulates axioms and first principles which is properly the domain of philosophy and mathematics.I am arguing that Maths philosphy and the assorted sciences are continuous rather than discrete in any meaningful sense. There really is no soft science or hard science only good science bad science and pseudoscience.Appeals to the difficulty of learning or conducting the science say nothing about its worthwhileness its likelihood of providing nontrivial information about the world or its usefulness.

Anyway spoilers ahead.It has been a while since reading but I saw someone post a thread where everyone was talking about how the book had a really depressing ending but when I finished reading it I felt kind of happy.Throughout the whole book we feel sorry for Winstons circumstances that he has to live under complete domination by The Party and he understands that they are changing history and suppressing his individuality. He seems constantly depressed when he first sees Julia he is paranoid she is part of the thought police and he says he hates her when really he has no reason to.In the end he learns to love Big Brother and is finally happy his last moment is one of complete bliss. After the struggle of the whole book it is nice that the protagonist we have grown attached to has eventually found peace and is no longer scared.I understand why some people find it depressing as The Party arent overthrown and the totalitarians that oppress the people win. But it was foolish to think that Winston could have really changed the situation and in his circumstance it is surely better to follow The Party and be happy than struggle towards an unreachable goal and be depressed.Ignorance is strength .',\n 'Title says it all Waffles gt Pancakes.

If you happen to be born in a place or culture a where there is injustice against the group you belong to chances are you will never escape. You will be treated like you are less than human and there is nothing you can do about it. People wont hear your pleas for help precisely because the society you live in has ALLOWED the injustice into which you were born.

I also believe that this is reprehensible. Your ability to learn and be edified I feel is directly hindered by selfconfidence.In my experience I have learned so much more by questioning what I already thought or did as opposed to being certain of myself. I often find that the most effective means of approaching a situation is to consider as much about it as I can and tentatively operate on what conclusions I do draw but constantly questioning those conclusions until either they work for me or no longer hold water. I think that there is no such thing as overthinking and that any situation can only ever be improved by careful consideration.Consequently I see people that display confidence in themselves and their beliefs as almost intentionally maintaining a blissful ignorance.',\n 'With the recent shooting in California people have once again taken to another hashtagphrase to rally around YesAllWomen another in the line of phrases over the years Kony BringBackOurGirls OccupyWallStreet etc that the masses will use as a way of getting the word out about the flavor of the week news story.

I believe the bitterness of losing the Civil war is what bread the continuing racism in the south that we see to this day. I dont believe the KKK would exist if slavery woulda been abolished economically and not imposed on them by the north.I also believe the south had the moral high ground in the war.

Basically the idea is that if a company has more money itll hire more people which reduces unemployment and boosts the economy. My logic thusfar first as far as Im aware there is no evidence that this tactic has ever worked.With that said the companies that would get the most money from a tax cut would be the largest ones like Walmart McDonalds etc. For some reason I doubt that a company like Walmart with a billion net profit needs more money to hire people. Most of the tax revenue the federal government would lose in a tax cut would be going to companies like this that dont actually need it.',\n 'In discussions of racism that arise on this subreddit there is a popular refrain that there can be no differences between races because there is no such thing as race. Therefore people who are racist are behaving irrationally because it doesnt make sense to feel differently about different people based on a criteria that is itself not welldefined.I see many issues inherent in this line of reasoning but rather than debating those Id like to take this viewpoint as a given. Though if I have misstated the viewpoint in some way then do feel free to correct it and address my points towards a better stated version of this viewpoint as Id hate to be wasting everyones time arguing against a strawman that no one actually believes in.Having gotten that out of the way it strikes me that by the same token for those who subscribe to this belief that programs that have worked to help disadvantaged races are equally indefensible. These programs have made vast improvements in the conditions of groups identified by the common shorthands of race. Nonetheless those improvements were not worthy of praise since they were no different than any other attempt at categorizing people by the failed nomenclature of races.For example every time a university analyzed its student bodys racial composition it was engaging in incorrect thinking and every time a university implemented admissions policies to foster racial diversity it was chasing nonsense and in the end all the improved racial representation numbers that universities have trumpeted were not something they should have been proud of since there is no such thing as race.Have I overlooked anything in my understanding of this viewpoint?',\n 'I feel that caffeinated soft drinks are more harmful than ecigarettes and yet they continue to be sold to and marketed to minors. Caffeine is an addictive substance and the high fructose corn syrup that is so common in soft drinks can contribute to many longterm health problems including tooth decay obesity heart disease liver failure and diabetes. There is evidence to show that high fructose corn syrup is also an addictive substance. And the artificial sweeteners that can be used in its stead also come with their host of problems. Along with all the alarmist news stories about ecigarette use increasing among high school students I feel that the public should be every bit as outraged by products like Mountain Dew and Coca Cola being marketed to children and teenagers.',\n 'Pie and cake are both immensely popular desserts in the western world.

I think instead of a degree being awarded it should named simply as it is an award eg award for lifetime contribution to Or something similar and reserve the name degree for those that are more deserving of it.This is a view Ive had for a long time now and cant think of a valid reason for their existence. Looking at the wikipedia article I know just humour me they define it asAn honorary degree is an academic degree for which a university or other degreeawarding institution has waived the usual requirements such as matriculation residence study and the passing of examinationsIt seems like a slap in the face to anyone who has actually paid tuition spent years of their life devoted to attaining their degree and on top of that maybe even contributed to the university through societies or a parttime campus job. Any honorary degrees given out to me appears to be more like a PR stunt to associate themselves with a particular academic or even celebrity and seem just a little pathetic.inflate someones ego e.g now you have to call me Dr and the way honorary degrees can be paid for. None of this is anything against the degree itself.',\n 'There have been several stories in the news lately that have provoked outrage over schools expecting students to gasp PAY for their lunches and vilifying schools for feeding students without the money for a hot lunch a different cold lunch instead.I feel this is an unfair assessment of the situation and that it is the parents and not the schools who are at fault. It is the responsibility of the parent to take care of the basic needs of their child and adequate foodnutrition is one of those basic needs. Sending the child to school does not absolve them of that responsibility and does not transfer that responsibility to the school.The most common argument I have heard is that children are required to go to school and therefore the school is acting as a parent for those eight hours and is responsible for providing for the students needs during that time. I dont find that argument reasonable for two reasons. The first is that the school is not responsible for providing any other consumable goods to the students pencil paper clothing etc. and it is unreasonable to arbitrarily assign the responsibility of nutrition to them.',\n 'I think illegal drugs should stay illegal and I havent heard a convincing argument otherwise. This is from the perspective of a UK citizen but I believe the US system is broadly the same in terms of what substances are illegal so that is equally applicable. Some substances are illegal for a myriad of reasons such as being detrimental to health productivity other people and so on. Although it is difficult to pick one specific criterion for what makes a specific illicit drug illegal I think that overall illicit drugs staying illegal does much less harm to society than if they were legalised.

This obviously makes some sense.But Id like to take it a step further.Instead of registering with the SSS yearolds should be required to enlist in the Army Reserve for the eight year service period.The reasons for this are pretty simple as I see it Firstly we would never need a draft again because if a large war came we could simply activate some of the millionodd Reservists to fight.',\n 'The longest relationship Ive been in is about months and at the end it was just heart ache and pain of having someone break up with me.

Essentially my current train of thought is as follows. Voter turnout in the United States has turned into a huge issue that politicians and those more politically inclined have latched onto.

Something is wrong with us.The rich business savvy Brits they are and the music they make is not only an inauthentic loose impression of folkAmericana music but by bridging the gap between that genre and corporate pop they have perverted the essence of what folk is supposed to be.There exists a tradition of confronting the zeitgeist of society in folk music an independent spirit that will stand up to the bland apathy of a generation of pundits and the status quo. In the sixties folk music mattered to a generation who needed to express a message.We need folk musicians now more than ever with something important to say that matters from a sincere place for a population that needs a voice. Thats what Dylan did and the literal opposite of what Mumford is doing with their whitewashed genre mashup.They are selling records and tickets to people who refuse to confront issues or challenge their minds with innovation in the form of organic music. They might as well be fucking robots and robots are not allowed to play folk music for the sake of all thats holy.What they make is the soundtrack to a commercial designed to capture ones attention in small doses without any sort of meaningful investment on the part of the listener.As critics have pointed out their songs are a manufactured lowest common denominator formula.',\n 'I raised this point in rPoliticalDiscussion and apparently its a controversial issue so I thought I would defend it here to expose myself to the arguments of the other side.

The Bible or the interpretation of the Bible that a suitable authority uses says that abortion is wrong so its always wrong. Maybe we could make a few exceptions in extreme cases like rape but it is certainly not acceptable to have an abortion to make the mothers life easier.An atheist on the other hand will typically have a very different epistemology.

I am fine with eating free range meat but can rarely afford it. I generally try to avoid any animal product that involves animal suffering this includes factory farmed meat.I am also an atheist and I do not believe that religious reasons are sufficient to justify an exception to the law. I would be fine with the criminalisation of throat slitting without prestunning as a form of slaughter even if that makes halal slaughter more difficult and kosher slaughter impossible.However I do believe that the majority of the meat industrialised nations eat is reared in conditions that are horrible for the animals involved. The killing of these animals is the only humane part of their lives I say with more than a hint of irony at least for the or so percent of animals that survive long enough to be slaughtered and dont die of disease or other horrible deaths.Factory farming for the uninitiatedWikipediaWSPACIWFASPCAI believe that anybody who disapproves boycotts or abstains from eating halal meat for animal welfare reasons should also do so for the vast majority of animal products in the industrialised world and even if you do these things ending halal slaughtering is not the most pressing issue compared to the treatment of most livestock during their rearing.Whilst I am pleased with the show of interest in animal welfare I feel that I cannot support something so hypocritical.',\n 'The idea is that deliberately overeating will build eating habits that will be difficult to change later when you are working a desk job and being a dad and not burning off those calories.

As such that shining bastion of white America Fox News sprang to the defense of this kid to proclaim that prejudice against the opinions of an individual based solely on skin color or gender is wrong in any form.

Final response to the interbreeding option I do not think this is a valid option to maintain human self determination in the face of a superior alien species as interbreeding with the aliens would create offspring that I do not consider human. If humanity attempted to match the alien species through interbreeding I would consider this extinction.

I struggled for a while after losing my faith. I went from being certain that I was going to get into heaven someday to being uncertain of the existence of freewill afterlife and objective morality. It was a bit disconcerting but I held onto my intellect and pursued the wisdom of great men and women to try to figure out what was what.I came to the conclusion that while nihilism is certainly a plausible world view I simply couldnt accept it.

In heroic defeats the losing side at least gets to go down with honor dignity and glory whereas a blundering victory usually just serves as another example in highlighting the horror and incompetence of war. This is a hard case to argue I understand as many people understandably are against war in general. However I believe that as humans warfare is an inevitable part of our existence and if its going to occur we may as well accept that the examples of glory and bravery displayed in battles showcases an enlightening side of the human spirit. However I must preface that Im discussing this from a philosophical poetic point of view.',\n 'I believe that the sorting of comments is improved when people downvote almost as frequently as they upvote. We are all familiar with the phenomenon of late posts getting buried and early posts remaining at the top of the thread. This phenomenon is the direct result of the fact that most people only read the first few comments in a thread combined with the fact that people tend to upvote significantly more than they downvote.Let me use a hypothetical example to explain my point. Imagine there is a hour old thread with comments in it and the top five comments are all mediocre comments that of people who read them upvote. Then someone posts an extremely high quality comment that over of people who read it upvote.',\n 'I first started thinking this when Rick Santorum made his infamous comments comparing homosexuality to bestiality. While this statement was obviously just pandering to a knee jerk emotional reaction to the idea of bestiality the reaction from the GRA Gay rights activists was surprising. While some lip service was payed to consent the emotion of the responses seemed to sum up as Bestiality is disgusting to me and homosexuality is not. Therefore the comparison is invalid and offensive. The consent idea was more of a rationalization and an afterthought.',\n 'Being born has two meanings when a child is expelled from the womb and when a new legal entity is recognized by the state.From Changing the definition of birth and when legal protections apply offers many benefits to parents and the state.If birth is not recognized until the birth certficate has been filed then parents can decide to discard damaged or unwanted babies which would be a legal abortion instead of an illegal murder.Fathers could opt out of child support by not signing the birth certicate. The number of single parent households would drop because the baby would not have been born until both parents sign the birth certificate. Until the baby has been born the birth certificate filed it would not be a citizen.Cases of misattributed paternity could be eliminated by requiring a paternity test before the father could sign the birth certificate. Prenatal genetic testing can identify paternity as an incidental finding. Birth certificates would identify the parents of the child and not the people intending to raise it so anonymous sperm and egg donation would be illegal.Prenatal paternity testing would allow for provisional filing of the legal birth certificate before the baby has been physically born.Babies that have been physically born but not legally born would be in a legal state similar to cohabiting couples who are not married.',\n 'My view is that in some situations a nazi comparison can be a useful and valid tool in an argument and that when such useful comparisons are made Godwins Law and other similar cultural memes serve only to make the discussion less fruitful. An example showed up earlier today in an rFoodforthought thread.uWestlondonwannabe saidTo which utvrr repliedutvrr was downvoted and people replied with comments about Godwins law and how you just cant compare the two. Now Im not saying that the comparison is exactly correct but rather that elucidating exactly how the death penalty is different from the holocaust i.e. actually responding to the content of the comparison rather than just dismissing it would be an important contribution to the conversation allowing us to more clearly understand the parameters under which uWestlondonwannabes statement is true which to me is at the heart of what people are trying to get from this discussion.On the other hand Im not saying that there are no circumstances under which Nazi comparisons can be wrongly used. Two examples that I think of immediately are Person A makes the comparison to which person B responds with This situation is different because... and then person A comes back with Oh so youre on the Nazis side? The comparison is The Nazis did X too when X has nothing to do with why people hate the Nazis.So go ahead and !',\n 'This is inspired by the question on the political compass that no matter how many times and after how many years between tests I always strongly agree with.

For example I hold nothing against British people who happen to be born in the county that oppressed the country I happened to be born in. The conflict in northern Ireland as it stands with riots over parades and flagburning is patheticMoreover I think that if one decides that they are not responsible for the terrible actions of their government as they did not choose to be AmericanRussian they cannot deem themselves patriotic without being hypocritical.

Currently we should be thankful that we live in a age that women can get safe and effective abortions with minimal damage. I think that if tomorrow an abortion ban were affected that by the end of the day there will be just as many abortion clinics but they will all move undergound.

There are or have been quite the assortment of laws on the books restricting various other civil rights from voting to abortion and everything in between.

The United States has come a long ways from the s and no nation could ever invade in this day and age due to the nuclear threat we pose and our massive army.

A stated reason for the Second Amendment is to resist tyranny but I dont think that is possible in this day and age as the modern US military would crush any resistance as they have the best tanks in the world try shooting an Abrams and the best air force. not to mention that few would seriously take up arms in America as we have it far too good. in the end i do not believe there is a valid reason for the second amendment as weapons such as assault rifles are pretty much unnecessary and even a liability as they have been used for horrible tragedies such as Sandy Hook and Aurora',\n 'I understand this might be suited to a different subreddit and that its a bit unconventional for a post here but I thought Id try here first.

Therefore there must be right and wrong answers to questions of morality and values that potentially fall within the purview of science.

Unfortunately the majority of people is scientific illiterate and cannot be easily convinced to support such strategies because they invariably involve some sacrifice here and now.Researchers try to be honest and say things like there is a small but significant chance that ocean level will raise and destroy Bangladesh as we know it. The risk is lets say in years Reality is we will not act on it even if acting would be logical and sound from an economic point of view alone. Sure we should improve education first but its not a fast process and in the meanwhile Bangladesh is at risk.

Thats true of course but I think it would make much more sense to simply study the English language directly. Rhetoric as I understand it focuses on how language is used in the present deals directly with common strategies of persuasion and doesnt waste as much time on reading long books. An education in literature will also spend time to ensure that you able to understand archaic language find hidden meaning in fictional stories and identify important authors and books.

Many of both consoles nonexclusives have also been shown to underperform graphically when pitted against desktops made for the same price as them.The other point that I feel no longer separates consoles and PCs is their firmware and the need to constantly update it as well as patch games via internet.

Maybe theyre jerks maybe they did something really great set up irrigation maintained a road and feel that theyve earned this percentage. Either way that sounds like taxation which is a function of government.',\n 'It says here that scientific theories cannot be patented. Scientific theories are not discoveries. There is no way of confirming whether a theory is true or false. Only ways of confirming it. For example the Law of conservation of massenergy can be verified so many times but it cannot be proven as true for all cases.',\n 'I love the humanities. I am an engineering major but Ive always thought that the study of art history literature drama and many other subjects is critical to understanding ourselves as humans. So I just want to set the record straight that I do value the humanities. However my current view is that it is the prerogative of publicly funded institutions to serve the wellbeing of our society by creating jobs and providing a return on investment for those who pay tuition. Statisticallyin terms of average starting salary return on investment seems to be highest in the areas of science engineering and business.',\n 'While I am not an advocate of equality of outcome I do believe that there should be equality of opportunity. This means that I believe harder work merits more money to spend on frivolities like fancy gadgets exclusive vacations and surpassingly excellent food drink and housing but that any two people regardless of who their parents are or where they were born ought to have the same chance to access these benefits if they work equally hard.I consider the rights I have outlined in this posts title necessary for equality of opportunity to exist. I do not suggest that any of these things should be mandatory only readily available for those who are interested.Heres why Living in an unsafe environment presents a serious distraction towards which an individual must divide a portion of their attention. This means that a given quantity of effort one person exerts focusing solely on their goals will have greater rewards than the same quantity of effort will elicit for another person who must allocate part of their energy towards simply staying alive. Without access to nutritious food an individual is at an immediate disadvantage their brain development and physical health will be stunted which serves to limit the rewards that hard work is capable of accomplishing.',\n 'They are jobs even the mentally handicap can do. They take very minimal education and labor. They should not be used to support a family but it is good to have jobs out there to supplement income. They are good jobs for teens or someone in between work.

But that is exactly how all ideas begin. Avoid responses that amount to This would never happen!Currently I favor a onetime massredistribution of wealth in the US to correct the imbalance along with the institution of Basic Income. This would be a grand Reset Button to level the playing field and attempt to help keep it more level in the future. Concurrent with this I believe we need to basically outlaw Renting and actively create a situation where there are more Owners rather than what we have now fewer wealthy Owners in control of large portions of property and most poor people renting.',\n 'Wars or armed conflicts in general are a cause of huge suffering and only minor conflicts could exist without military. Therefore I see people who are involved in military as terrorists. By military I refer to any organization which deals with weapons and related technology not necessarily a national army an actual so called terrorist organization for example is also a military unit albeit possibly small.A promilitary argument would be that it is protecting me. But protecting me from who? From other armies.',\n 'Im an atheist. Lately Ive been thinking about what it means to be human and live life. Ive come to the conclusion that a life without the idea of a higher power and a greater meaning is ultimately emptier and less fulfilling in a sense. Without the idea of a god or some sort of higher power we are just coincidences of the development of the universe. Although we can give ourselves the illusion of meaning by developing relationships and keeping ourselves busy we are no more than atoms and molecules that are the result of pure coincidence.',\n 'James Franco recently got caught up trying to have sex with an extremely attractive year old girl. His manner to be fair was boorish and very direct asking her simply should I get a hotel room? skipping all the pleasantries. However not only did she tell him she was but in New York State is legal age. There was an uproar from feminist groups and the media in general accusing Franco of being a pervert. He publicly apologized.What should he apologize for?',\n 'Just as a disclaimer I would like to say that I am agnostic and have a bachelor of science in both biology and political science. Atheism the doctrine or belief that there is no God disbelief in the existence of a supreme being or beings. According to dictionary.comSo here is my problem. I often hear or read atheists criticizing theists because the have faith and believe in something that is not proven and may not be able to be proven. I am not saying that all atheists are like this but some are.',\n 'The United States Military has different physical entry requirements for men and women. The physical entry requirements should be the exact same for men and women because they are held to the same standard.Now that women are able to assume combat positions This is not only in the military certain public safety departments are lowering their standards so women can pass the physical portion of the test. I believe that lowering the standard for women is degrading towards women and is insinuating that they arent capable of doing the job as well as men are. Please Change My View!',\n 'By plus size I mean obese and overweight models because those pictures are what I see labeled as plus size. I know that most models are underweight. I do not support anorexia in people. However I believe that plus size models do not just raise the self confidence of overweight and obese womengirls they make them think that it is healthy. Schools and the government are all for decreasing obesity because it is unhealthy.I read that people want plus size obese Barbies and Disney princesses.',\n 'I was somewhat stunned that there wasnt already a on this. Maybe I used ineffective search terms. Whatever.I was raised evangelical Christian Southern Baptist specifically. All through my life I held Christian viewpoints. I still do but I am discovering that a lot of the Southern Baptist doctrines are little more than traditions established over the years and have little to no Biblical basis or else are based on misinterpretations of scripture.Recently Ive been more and more often pulled into the conflict between the church and gay rights.',\n 'A huge part of the world issues stem from the fact that people can lie and get away with it.To prevent people from lying we have morals ethics and principles and the deterrent that is suposed to be the justice system.I think its fair to say the tools aforementioned are not working the way they should as we all continue to lie on a day to day basis. And when the people with power lie bad stuff likely happens.I read somewhere here that cops with cameras strapped to their heads reduce police abuse by .

My understanding or impression of successful politicians is that their number one priority is money and power. I do not believe any successful politician has a continued interest in bettering the country in any meaningful way. I think that politicians are driven by money from their investors and their salaries. I think government is pretty much a joke of beurocracy where nothing gets properly discussed or worked out because everyone is too busy measuring their dicks.',\n 'Let me be clear I would never discriminate against someone who identifies as genderfluid or treat them worse than anyone else. I cant deny that I have some internal eyerolling when I see the term thrown around though. It seems to me that identifying as genderfluid stems from a failure to separate gender identity from gender roles. For example someone is malebodied and doesnt experience dysphoria but they play with dolls or like the color pink. This doesnt mean that theyre some sort of boygirl mix it just means theyre a boy who likes dolls.',\n 'In this country the US every citizen has a vote regardless of their contribution. Being a citizen of this country provides benefits such as national defense and law enforcement. Since everyone benefits equally then everyone should pay equally. When I purchase a taco at Taco Bell the price is the same no matter my income.The budget was billion and the voting population was so a flat tax would be per citizen.Since many people could not afford this there would be pressure to cut the federal budget. If only defense and other essential functions were included then the budget could be cut to billion for per citizenFunding the government by a flat tax would equalize political power to contribution to the budget and restrain growth of the budget.',\n 'I know this might sound shocking but hear me out. When I was little a friends dad once told me If you fight someone way smaller than you dont expect them to fight clean.

I just want another point of view maybe I am missing something. Not looking to argue just express ideas.It is true people are abusing welfare but I dont know any actual REAL facts on the subject. I used to think they shouldnt be taxed and I am still shakey on the subject but lean more towards yes. Please give me solid proof of why they shouldnt be taxed and why it benefits us.',\n 'This is somewhat dated information but it generally speaks to my point. Even though that articles overall view counters my view it statesWhile the Constitution is certainly an ambiguous document if youre looking for ambiguity it isnt really that complex and is generally straight forward. And it should be especially straight forward to the greatest legal minds in the country if we are able to assume that that group includes the Supreme Court Justices.So if all the Justices are doing is interpreting the Constitution and telling us what it means there should be very little dissension. Virtually every vote should be with a few decisions thrown in. A decision should be virtually unheard of.Having so many votes that are not indicates that the Justices are either a not very good at interpreting the Constitution i.e. they arent really qualified for the job or b they are basing their votes upon their own personal andor political opinions rather than an interpretation of the Constitution.',\n 'Heres an article about it Basically I think all this is going to do is allow rich people to have even more influence in Washington which is going to mean worse candidates that only have the interest of their corporate sponsors in mind when they write and pass legislation. The government will become even more cronyist than it is now.Instead I think This should go back to the way it was a limit on individual donations. I honestly think person per election cycle would be better. Citizen United should be overturned thus disallowing corporations from donating money. It should come from the individuals within said corporation if at all.I cant really see how this helps out individuals who dont have a lot of money or any money to donate.',\n 'Ok so we see it all the time especially on Reddit Have some empathy They need to be taught empathy We all need more empathy. And I cannot understand why.Empathy according to wikipedia isNow I dont see how it benefits me or the greater society to recognize these feelings. In fact it often would benefit me more to ignore that the other person had the emotions. If we werent as empathetic we would be more on guard as we wouldnt trust people and spend less energy devoted to helping people and places that do not affect us.At the same time everyone I know thinks I am wrong so please',\n 'First of all Im not a pacifist. Im skeptical of the value of the right to bear arms and though Im not necessarily against it I do believe disarmament is ideal. I wont get into the political ramifications of the gun debate here in America I just want to focus on one aspect of it that we requires guns specifically conceal carry guns for selfdefense.Ive studied selfdefense arts like krav maga for a bit now and everything Ive learned about guns tells me they are terrible for this purpose.
