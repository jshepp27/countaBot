      "text/markdown": "> **CMV: Males and Females are socially and emotionally incompatible and heterosexual relationships are unrealistic and farcical.** \n>  \n>  Hi CMV! \n> \n> I am of the belief that there cannot exist a legitimate emotional bond between a male and a female that lead to a loving relationship (that is - one of romance). Not once have I seen a couple that did not have an enormous gap in interests, composure, speech patterns, and emotional engagement. There's always and awkward disparity between each partner, and they seem to be tolerating each other, whilst there is little to grasp on why they are interested in each other aside from basic biology. \n> \n> As a result of this, homosexual relationships have always seemed purely the logical and socially optimal choice for anyone pursuing a relationship, and heterosexual relationships continue only because of a heteronormitive society and the biology of reproduction (which I believe is immoral, but that's another topic). I may be biased, but from my perspective and experience I've simply never seen a straight couple that was legitimately compatible in most ways. \n>  \n>  **Counter** \n>  \n>  &gt; Not once have I seen a couple that did not have an enormous gap in interests\n> \n> For what it's worth, there are two large biases here with you need to contend with.\n> \n> 1. The couples which you know and see will be influenced heavily with who you associate with and is not representative of relationships in general or the potential which some relationships can reach\n> \n> 2. This also depends heavily upon your judgment of those relationships. Which has the following problems \n> \n>   * You might not have complete indepth knowledge between the dynamics of these couples\n> \n>   * Even if you did, you might midjudge aspects of a relationship. Do you know exactly what the other person needs or is looking for? Do you know what elements create successful relationships? Can you judge those correctly 100% of the time?\n> \n> Also,\n> \n> &gt; and heterosexual relationships continue only because of a heteronormitive society and the biology of reproduction \n> \n> What about relationships which last past this stage? This statement obviously doesn't hold up either.\n> \n> &gt; I may be biased, but from my perspective and experience I've simply never seen a straight couple that was legitimately compatible in most ways.\n> \n> That's basically your argument \"i've never seen it work before therefore it cant work\". It's not a very good position to defend because, as you've already awknowledged, its covered in bias which prevents it from being logically valid.\n> \n> \n> \n> ___\n> \n> I'm personally in a working relationship and the differences between thinking which come from being different sexes is quite apparent, that doesn't mean we cant work with it though.\n> \n> &gt;they seem to be tolerating each other\n> \n> Yes, there's a lot of that in a relationship. After all of the love hormones wear off after a couple of years there is an element of toleration since your partners flaws begin to show and you become to get to know them. The point is though that we're also able to accept each others flaws and let on with our lives despite them.\n> \n> The reason why we can ignore them is because more of the time we are supportive of each other. We communicate openly and honestly and we are good listeners. We enjoy each others company much more often than not. We also accept that if the other falls short for some reason that they are only human and that's to be expected."
