Because of all of this even though I do believe that transsexualness stems from a mismatch in a persons brain and biological sexbody I also still believe that transsexual individuals usually still reinforce the idea of gender and even gender stereotypes or generalizations.I think another reason this is so alien and confusing to me is that I for myself as an individual entirely reject genders and gender rolesstereotypes while remaining happily male never using the term manmen for myself and being okay with any pronoun people use so long as it wasnt meant to be disrespectful.',\n  't3_4ith5c'),\n ('VIEW CHANGED Through this I have learned that yes both can be biased but why is a jury better?

      "Brazil. Minimum income has been increasingly accepted by the Brazilian government. In 2004, President Lula da Silva signed into law a bill to establish a universal basic income. Committee member Lady Rhys-Williams argued that the incomes for adults should be more like a basic income. She was also the first to develop the negative income tax model. Her son Brandon Rhys Williams proposed a basic income to a parliamentary committee in 1982, and soon after that in 1984, the Basic Income Research Group, now the Citizen's Basic Income Trust, began to conduct and disseminate research on basic income. Many technology experts and technology entrepreneurs have begun endorsing basic income in the 2000s and 2010s. These include Marshal Brain, Sam Altman, James Hughes, Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes, Elon Musk, and Mark Zuckerberg (in his 2017 Harvard commencement speech), and Jeremy Rifkin. The overriding theme among technologists who favor basic income is the belief that automation is creating an increasingly unstable labor market. Several British academics have been involved in the basic income debate. Among them the following:Organisations. The organisation Basic Income UK is 'a collective of independent people promoting unconditional basic income as a progressive social policy for the United Kingdom, and beyond'. Basic Income.

      "Several British academics have been involved in the basic income debate. Among them the following:Organisations. The organisation Basic Income UK is 'a collective of independent people promoting unconditional basic income as a progressive social policy for the United Kingdom, and beyond'. In May 2019, a report by Professor Guy Standing, commissioned by the Progressive Economic Forum and forwarded to John McDonnell (the acting Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer) suggested different models for piloting basic income. Standing's report ('Basic Income as Common Dividends: Piloting a Transformative Policy. A Report for the Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer)' cites a 'perfect storm' of factors that lead to the need for a basic income: Broad ethical justifications for basic income, which Standing cites as 'social justice, security, freedom and solidarity' are now working in combination with urgent socio-economic demands. A basic income is defined in the report as a policy that guarantees all members of a society a minimum amount of income. One type of basic income considered is the most well-known: a universal basic income (UBI). With a UBI, everyone receives a cash transfer at regular intervals, with no conditions, and no eligibility requirements except residency in the jurisdiction. Congress eventually approved a guaranteed minimum income for the elderly and the disabled. In the mid-1970s the main competitor to basic income and negative income tax, the Earned income tax credit (EITC), or its advocates, won over enough legislators for the US Congress to pass laws on that policy. In 1986, the Basic Income European Network, later renamed to Basic Income Earth Network (BIEN), was founded, with academic conferences every second year. The Queensland Greens were the first Australian party to adopt a Guaranteed Adequate Income (GAI) policy in 1999. Basic Income Guarantee Australia was accepted into the Basic Income Earth Network in 2006 as an affiliate member. In August 2014, ACOSS made a recommendation to simplify the welfare system via a basic income support payment; however, this differs from a universal guaranteed income in that it would still be means-tested.\n",

Income taxes provide one mechanism for addressing after-tax inequality. Increasing the effective progressivity of income taxes reduces the gap between higher and lower incomes. This suggests that non-EU workers may have a tougher time finding high-skilled jobs than getting low-skilled work. Although income inequality between low-skilled and high-skilled workers is increasing, low-skilled workers are generally very well paid, inequality remains low and the lower and higher classes alike enjoy a very generous universal welfare state. Income taxes and cash benefits traditionally play an important role in redistributing income in Sweden, reducing inequality among the working-age population by about 28% (the OECD average [Of what?] NYU economist William Baumol found that substantial inequality does not stimulate growth because poverty reduces labor force productivity. Economists Dierk Herzer and Sebastian Vollmer found that increased income inequality reduces economic growth, but growth itself increases income inequality.
