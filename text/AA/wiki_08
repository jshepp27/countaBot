However, some hairdressing salons are giving the machines \"center stage\". Products available from these unconventional vending machines include mini vibrators, \"silicone ticklers\", \"lust fingers\", and bottles of \"love liquid\" (an edible lubricant).\nThe Alphabet Bar in London's West End, host to the first sex toy vending machine in the U.K., claims many people visit especially for the machine, and describes it as a \"great success\". Alan Lucas, the managing director of the company behind this enterprise, Tabooboo, suggests that the success of the machines is due to younger people having a more liberal view of sex toys. He stated, \"The most popular product is a vibrating rod ring which is something [the man] wears [on his penis]\".\nThe machines are expected to begin appearing in the U.S. and Italy."}

These cartoons were originally published in the Danish newspaper \"Jyllands-Posten\", causing waves of violence and protests among Muslims worldwide.\nTom Flynn, editor of the secular magazine, said that he was only acting alongside several European papers that reprinted the cartoons \"demonstrating a commitment to free expression and a free press.\" He commented further that \"no religious teaching, community, or institution should be held immune from criticism simply because of its religious nature.\"\nThree articles will be published alongside the cartoons. In the first, Flynn will trace the controversy and explain the magazine's decision to publish them. A second, by R. Joseph Hoffmann, director of the Council for Secular Humanism's Committee for the Scientific Examination of Religion, will present further commentary; the last will be on the history of the Prophet Muhammad.\nFour of the original twelve cartoons are to be published: the image of Muhammad wearing a bomb with its fuse lit as a turban, another claimed to show horns coming out of the Prophet's turban, Muhammad [or an Imam] greeting suicide bombers in heaven, and one showing a male face on a Muslim with Islam's star and crescent. Flynn said this last cartoon \"is included as an example of how the collection's less sharply focused entries fell flat.\"\nArif Desai, Imam of the Islamic Society of Niagara Frontier in Amherst, New York, said that the Muslim community felt sorrow over the magazine's decision to publish the cartoons.\n\"We feel sorrow, we feel hurt and insulted as these are very disturbing, insulting cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad. Obviously, we know and believe in freedom of speech, but along with freedom of speech comes responsibility,\" said Desai.\nThe cartoons will be published next week on March 15, 2006."}

{"id": "35283", "revid": "14511", "url": "https://en.wikinews.org/wiki?curid=35283", "title": "Buffalo, N.Y. hotel proposal delayed further", "text": "The Common Council of Buffalo voted on Tuesday to send the Elmwood Village Hotel proposal \"to committee for further discussion\", after citing the need for more public involvement.\nThe \"Elmwood Village Hotel\" is a development proposal by the Savarino Construction Services Corporation, a project designed by the architect Karl Frizlen of The Frizlen Group. The hotel would be placed on the southeast corner of Elmwood and Forest Avenues in Buffalo. \nTo make way for the project, at least five buildings located at 1109 to 1121 Elmwood Ave would be demolished. At least two properties on Forest Avenue could also be demolished. The Elmwood properties, according to Eva Hassett, Vice President of Savarion Construction, are \"under contract\", but it is unclear if Savarino Construction actually owns the Elmwood properties. Hans Mobius, a former mayorial candidate, is still believed to be the current owner the properties. Mobius also owns 607 Forest Avenue.\nOther properties could be effected.\nThe properties 605 and 607 Forest Avenue could also be included in the proposal according to Hassett.\n\"We would use a Special Development Plan to rezone 1119-1121 Elmwood and 605 Forest to a C-2 zoning category,\" stated Hassett. It is possible that Savarino Construction may try to obtain a variance for 605 Forest, which would allow them to enforce eminent domain, should the hotel be allowed to go forward.\nThe building at 607 Forest was also discussed to be rezoned, but it is unclear what the plans would be for that property. During the February 28 Common Council meeting, Hassett stated that the properties 605 and 607 were \"now off the agenda\".\nPano Georgiadis, owner of Pano's Restaurant at 1081 Elmwood, owns the property at 605 Forest and attended Tuesday's Common Council meeting.\n\"Having a hotel is a bright idea. We all love the idea of a hotel, but the way that it is presented, is wishful thinking. This hotel does not fit. It's like putting two gallons of water in a gallon jug, it does not fit. At the last meeting, the architect admitted that they are planning to put the undergound parking lot and the hotel, right at the property line. If I open my window, I will be able to touch the wall, that goes fifty feet high\", said Georgiadis. \n\"There is a problem having a seventy-two room hotel and fifty-five parking spaces. That means that all the other cars will spill all over the neighborhood. The footprint is simply too small. If you have a bigger [parking] lot, and a smaller hotel, I will welcome a hotel. I have a parking lot at my own business, and I am chasing people all day long. Remember, the city says it has 'zero tolerance [for illegal parking]'. Try telling that to the guy from Albany who came to see his kids, that are going to Buffalo State, who would get tickets totaling over a hundred dollars\", added Georgiadis.\nThe city's Planning Board is scheduled to meet on March 14, 2006 at 9:00 a.m. about the proposal. Although a discussion will take place, no vote is expected to be taken.\nAt the moment, none of the properties are zoned for a hotel. Savarino Construction plans on asking for a C2 zoning permit. If that does not work, they plan to implement a new zoning plan called a \"special development plan\" which would allow for only a hotel on the site. That zone would not be able to be changed.\nMobius accused of being a slumlord by local residents.\n\"This [project] justifies Mobius's refusal to invest in any maitenance or improvements\", on the properties said Clarence Carnahan, a local resident. \"Where were the Council persons over the years? Where were the city inspectors over the years, to make sure that he maintained and improved his properties? The government was supposed to be protecting, not being preditorial. I see a predatorial issue here when it comes to this hotel. Over the years: Why has the local government been disfunctional when it came to Mobius's properties? Refusal to invest in improvements, doesn't that sound like a slumlord? Maybe I am missing a point here, but what kind of messages does this send to other slumlords that havn't been jailed or fined? It's [the hotel] trying to be pushed through.\"\nCarnahan also presented signs for residents and or business owners who are opposed to the hotel, that could be placed in windows or on stakes in the yard. Some of the signs said, 'No tell hotel', 'Hans off, no hotel', 'It takes more than a hotel to make a village'. and 'Keep Elmwood free, no hotel'. Carnahan plans on making more signs for a protest to be held on Saturday March 18, at 2:00 p.m. (EST) on Elmwood and Forest. Some signs were given to individuals after the meeting.\n\"First things first, Hans is the problem, and I don't think it has been addressed. Let's roll back the clock on this project. What can we do with Hans? There is such thing as eminent domain, which could be of greater interest to the community, to seize the property at its lowest assessed value\", said Nancy Pollina, co-owner of Don Apparel with Patty Morris at 1119 Elmwood. \"There are so many ideas that have not been explored and we are about to give this parcel away, to a big developer.\"\nMobius has not returned any calls by \"Wikinews\" regarding the situation.\nMobius may be giving up.\nA freelance journalist writing for \"Wikinews\" has obtained a letter, exclusively, addressed to one of the five business owners from Hans Mobius stating:\n\"There is a proposal to develop my property which you are currently renting. Because of opposition to this development, it does not look like it will happen. I will let you know if there any changes.\"\nDespite the letter, there have been no plans or decisions made to end the proposal. \nTo date, none of the business owners or residents of 1119-1121 Elmwood have received an eviction notice.\nBusiness owners and residents not against 'facelift'.\nBusiness owners and residents gave an indication of what they would like to see happen at the corner; a project similar to one done locally last year. There, developers renovated two buildings on Auburn and Elmwood Avenues, merging the buildings into one thus allowing for more shop space. Among some of the shops to move in after the development were Cone Five Pottery, The Ruby Slipper, and Abraham's Jewelers. Prior to the renovation work, the left building in the picture was boarded up for several years. Many of the concerned locals would like to see a similar development on Forest and Elmwood.\nRocco Termini, a developer in Buffalo, proposed a similar design at the February 28 community meeting \nIn an interview after the February 28 meeting, Termini stated, \"I will be willing to take a look at this myself, or I would be more than happy to be partners with Sam, Sam Savarino\", who is President and Chief Executive Officer of Savarino Construction Services Corp.\nSo far Savarino Construction has no plans to team up with Termini."}

The final vote was 30-2, with Ralph Wilson of the Buffalo Bills and Mike Brown of the Cincinnati Bengals voting no.\nFaced with a severely limiting salary cap of US$94.5 million in 2006 and the total loss of the salary cap in 2007, potentially ending the era of parity in the NFL, the owners' final caveat was not with the NFLPA, but with themselves. They were arguing over the continuation of revenue sharing, and how it should proceed through the CBA extension. In the end, owners agreed to a three-tiered revenue sharing system: The top five revenue teams would each pay the highest share into the revenue sharing pool, teams 6-10 would each pay the middle share, and teams 11-15 would each pay the lowest share. The lower 17 teams would then split the revenue sharing pool.\nThe CBA extension permits the salary cap to rise to $102 million for the 2006 season, and $109 million for 2007. It also extends the maximum proration period for signing bonuses to five years in 2006, then six years in 2007, before returning to five years in 2008.\nThe owners and the NFLPA have been working on a CBA extension for nearly two years. If the deadline had passed Wednesday night, then the current CBA would have ended after the 2007 season, with the owners fearing a strike and a possible challenge from another professional football league, like the USFL in the mid-1980s. This fear is substantiated by the 2004-05 strike in the NHL, during which an unsuccessful challenge was made by a re-formed World Hockey Association."}

Claiming to have been prompted by the John Seigenthaler Wikipedia biography controversy, the site http://www.wikipediaclassaction.org once sought parties to build a defamation suit against the wiki-based encyclopedia. Today, that site points to the Officialwire news service, known to be associated with Greg Lloyd Smith. The long-standing Wikipedia-alleged association between Officialwire and the QuakeAID \"charity\" has also been confirmed due to that site being replaced with a similar redirection.\nThe class action website was initially registered to one Jennifer Monroe who is affiliated with QuakeAID, an organisation which Wikipedia editors have accused of being a scam following QuakeAID personnel having created their own article on Wikipedia last year. This came at the time of the Indian Ocean earthquake, when Wikipedia user Baoutrust added QuakeAID to Wikipedia's victim donations page and sparked a dispute about the legitimacy of the organisation. Wikipedia editors did not acknowledge the tax-exempt status of the organisation which QuakeAID displayed on its home page; however, this can now only be seen via Google's cache. The 501(c) registration QuakeAID used to list is generally accepted as what defines an organisation as a charity with the United States. However, a number of groups removed QuakeAID from their public lists of charities following the Wikipedia dispute.\nThe dispute between QuakeAID and Wikipedia editors sparked a negative publicity campaign waged via Baou Trust's news service, OfficialWire. A number of articles which portray Wikipedia, or Wikipedians in a bad light have been published on the service. The site for the proposed class-action suit provides a link displaying results of a search of OfficialWire for stories about Wikipedia. This is not the first instance of the directors of Baou Trust using their newswire to run a smear campaign: a long-running campaign against former directors of the equity company IEQ was mounted following Greg Lloyd Smith's hostile takeover of the firm.\nSmith is no stranger to controversy, having been the target of legal action by Amazon.com when he registered the Amazon.gr and Amazon.com.gr sites and set up an Amazon.com look-alike selling Greek-language books. Amazon initially filed suit in Greece, and later in the US where their complaint described initial communication from Smith as a \"thinly-veiled shakedown\" when he offered to sell a controlling interest in CITI to the company for $1.6 million. The Amazon suit sought triple damages under RICO statutes stating, \"Fraudulent acts of mail and wire fraud, extortion and criminal copyright infringement constitute a pattern of racketeering, and pose a threat to society.\""}

In this instance, the inconclusive result from the contract lab in Georgia was confirmed through a second rapid test at the National Veterinary Services Laboratory. Now, the Western blot test has returned a positive result, and that is sufficient for us to confirm this animal to be positive for BSE, which is why we are making this announcement today,\" said Clifford.\n\"The samples were taken from a non-ambulatory animal on a farm in Alabama. A local private veterinarian euthanized and sampled the animal and sent the samples for further testing, which was conducted at one of our contract diagnostic laboratories at the University of Georgia. The animal was buried on the farm, and it did not enter the animal or human food chains,\" he added.\nClifford also says the cow was at least ten years old, explaining, \"While epidemiological work to determine the animal\u2019s precise age is just getting under way and is ongoing, the attending veterinarian has indicated that, based on dentition, it was an older animal, quite possibly upwards of 10 years of age. This would indicate that this animal would have been born prior to the implementation of the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s 1997 feed ban,\" and that they are still looking into where the cow could have been born and raised. The cow had only been on the Alabama farm for about a year. Clifford also confirmed that the cow was meant for producing beef.\n\"We will be working to locate animals from this cow\u2019s birth cohort and any offspring,\" said Clifford. A birth cohort identifies animals born in the same herd within one year of the affected animal.\nClifford also adds that no part of the cow made it into the human food chain, saying, \"I want to emphasize that human and animal health in the United States are protected by a system of interlocking safeguards, and that we remain very confident in the safety of U.S. beef. Again, this animal did not enter the human food or animal feed chains.\"\nThis is the third case of Mad Cow disease in the U.S. The first case turned up in December of 2003, when a cow from a Washington State farm, born in Canada, tested positive for the disease. \nThe second cow to test positive for the disease, found last June, was born on a farm in Texas.\nOn March 1, 2006, Sweden announced its first possible case of Mad Cow disease, and on January 23, Canada announced its fourth case of the disease. \nWorldwide, at least 150 people have died from variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which is linked to Mad Cow disease."}

In February, so little ice had formed that Environment Canada reported that such poor ice conditions had never been seen before in recorded history. The last time conditions approached what we saw in February 2006 was in 1969. The year 1981 was the third lowest ice year in recorded history.\nIn 1981, a number of harp seal mothers, who normally whelp only on ice, went to the shores of Prince Edward Island and Nova Scotia and gave birth on land. That year, due to the lack of ice, hundreds of thousands of seal pups drowned. The seals who were born on land faced both natural dangers such as death by exposure, and the danger of death at the hands of thousands of sealers, both licensed and unlicensed. These sealers took this rare \"opportunity\" to walk right up to a baby seal and kill it. Some of these seals were also attacked by domestic dogs. "}

Hong Kong has been selected, from six candidate cities, to hold the event. \nDuring selection of the host city, the Chinese community favored Hong Kong mostly, while Taipei was the second, and Shanghai and Beijing were tied for the third. The leader of the organzing committee, Kaurjmeb from Taipei, Taiwan, said that \"Comparing the advantages and disadvantages, Hong Kong is much better than Taipei,\" when she announced the result late March 14th at midnight. She said that Hong Kong Wikipedia users have been active, and other users agreed with that, so it led to success for Hong Kong in being selected as the host city.\nWikipedia is a multilingual Web-based free-content encyclopedia. It is written collaboratively by volunteers, allowing most articles to be changed by anyone with access to a web browser and an Internet connection. Wikipedia's policies guide most acticles to be acceptable to most people. Begun in 2001, Wikipedia has more than 2,500,000 articles in 212 languages. The Chinese version, which started on October 2002, reached nearly 60,000 acticles recently, and the number is increasing by more than 3,000 acticles every month. Its users are from Mainland China (PRC), Taiwan (ROC) and other places all over the world. \nThirteen percent of the users of the Chinese Wikipedia are from Hong Kong, and more than 6,000 Hongkongers have contributed by editing acticles. Due to the efforts of Hong Kong's active users, there is a lot of information related to Hong Kong. The aim of the Chinese Wikipedia conference is to gather the Chinese Wikipedia's users and other people, in order to discuss issues related to intellectual property, open educational resources and media etc., by means of talks and seminars.\nHolding the event in Hong Kong enables people from Mainland China and Taiwan to meet together. Hong Kong users, however, mainly worry about whether the resources for holding such an event are enough. Luckily, the Student Union of the Chinese University of Hong Kong is willing to give a hand. Ben Cheng, previous vice-president, pointed out, \"Issues about intellectual property and Wikipedia are ignored in Hong Kong.\" They hope that helping to organize such events can promote Wikimedia and its meaning to the citzens in Hong Kong. On the other hand, another student organization, the Hong Kong Secondary Sudents Union, also showed its interest in helping with the organizing work. Rock Li, the internal secretary, said that \"If the event is held in Hong Kong, people from Hong Kong will be more aware of intellectual property.\" "}

Eva Hassett, Vice President of Savarino Construction Services Corporation, confirmed last night that the company will be seeking a variance for the 605 Forest property. Originally, both the 605 and 607 Forest Avenue properties were going to have variances placed on them. As it stands, 607 Forest will not be directly affected by the proposal, should it go forward. Both 605 and 607 are currently occupied by residents.\nDuring Monday night's meeting, Pano Georgiadis, owner of 605 Forest and owner of Pano's Resuraunt at 1081 Elmwood Avenue in Buffalo, threatened to \"sue\" Savarino Construction if they tried to obtain a variance on his property to build the Elmwood Village Hotel.\nThe Elmwood Village Hotel is a proposal by Savarino Construction that would be placed on the corner of Forest and Elmwood in Buffalo. In order for the project to move forward, at least five buildings (1119-1121 Elmwood) which include both residences and businesses will have to be demolished. The hotel was designed by architect Karl Frizlen of the Frizlen Group. Although the properties are \"under contract,\" according to Hassett, it is unclear whether Savarino Construction owns the properties. Hans Mobius, a resident of Clarence, New York and former Buffalo Mayoral candidate, is still believed to own them.\nCurrently, none of the properties is zoned for a hotel.\nA freelance journalist writing for \"Wikinews\" asked Hassett what kind of zoning permit they [Savarino] would be applying for and, if 605 Forest is included, what zone that would be.\n\"There is a 'special development plan' in front of the council, which changes only one thing about the zoning. It allows one permitted use for just a hotel. The rest of the zoning remains as it is under the current Elmwood Business District zoning. 605 and 607 Forest are not required for the project. They are not part of the footprint for the project. Let me answer this question again. This is on the record, in council: 605 needs to be rezoned in order to facilitate the project because of the sideyard requirement. Anything in C-2 is excluded besides the hotel. So we've taken the C-2 and included the hotel as a permitted use, and excluded everything else and everything else remains the same.\"\nHowever, during the February 28 Common Council meeting, Hassett was quoted as saying that the two properties were \"off the agenda.\"\n\"Now Karl said, at the last meeting, that they will build this hotel right on the borderline [property line]. If a wall forty-five to fifty feet high goes next to this house, of course it's not right. You really have to go with whatever the city code says, so you have to get back as many feet as the city code says,\" said Georgiadis.\n\"If you try to get a variance to change the code, I will sue you. This is my home, number one,\" added Georgiadis. \"First of all I think we are all wasting our time here, you [Savarino], have already made up your mind, but if you go against city code, and you try to do the most rooms with a minimal amount of parking, again, I will sue you. If you build a hotel, in my idea its going to fail. It's doomed, ok. [If] it's going to be a home for the disabled, for the homeless, for recovery people, but that's another story. Then how is it going to be when we say, well I told you so? You will be over and done with. Its very hard to take a four story building [hotel] down.\"\nGeorgiadis stated last night that he was against the proposal and signed a petition to stop it, jokingly saying, \"this isn't a paper to sign to build the hotel, is it? Don't make me sign the wrong thing.\"\nJoseph Golombeck, district councilman, was at Monday's public meeting and said, \"we also did request this and the reason we are doing this as a special business district is so that it has to be this specific plan. They [Savarino] can't go halfway through it and in six months decide that [the hotel] it's going to be three floors. They can't decide it's going to be five floors. It has to be, per law, exactly what it is that they brought to us [the public] so far, and then ultimately to the City of Buffalo Common Council when it's approved. So if it gets approved, it has to be this specific, exact project. They couldn't make it fifty parking spots, they couldn't make it thirty. It has to be specifically what they have right here.\"\nA man who lives on Granger Street in Buffalo attended the meeting, speaking in favor of the hotel development. He claimed, \"There are a lot of low property values. Hopefully if we embrace development, our property values, for those of us who have property, will go up. There are a lot of people unfortunately, who are working hard, that do not get a chance to come to these meetings. I myself was at work and wasn't able to go to the last two meetings. I express that we appreciate that you [Savarino] invest in the City of Buffalo and for what you hope, because I do not think Savarino is into losing money. These people are not in business to be losing money here. They are hoping for the success of this [the hotel] more than any one of us. They are hoping that the property values in this area will go up more than any one of us, because it will benefit them [the residents and business owners], more than any one of us. I want this city to develop. I don't think anybody else is here understanding that we're looking for development in this city, we are looking for the city to get better. The councilman here is not interested in Buffalo failing.\"\nArea residents and business owners concerned about property damage.\nEvelyn Bencinich, resident of Granger Street, would have the hotel directly behind her home, if it were to be built. \n\"What about construction [time]? Is that just for the exterior, the nine months? Or does that include the interior? Is there going to be blasting through bedrock? Is there property protection for damage? Are you [Savarino and the Frizlen Group] responsible?\", asked Bencinich.\nAccording to Frizlen, there is a layer of solid bedrock at least 30 feet from the surface of the land saying, \"we anticipate that the bedrock is at least thirty feet down.\" He also admitted that \"we haven't done any soil sporrings,\" but did say \"the bedrock is somewhere in between twenty-five and thirty feet [down], we don't need to go that deep. So blasting is most likely out of it [the question].\"\n\"Personally, I can only speak from the city side, but a few years ago we rebuilt Vulcan Street, in the northwest corner of Buffalo, and there were a couple of properties that were damaged and they [the owners] were able to file a claim against the company that did the work and they won in each case. It was the same thing with a school that was built on Military Road. There were a couple of problems with foundations on a couple of properties, and they weren't sure if caused by the school or not, but the insurance company ended up paying them,\" answered Golombeck.\n\"I would assume that Savarino is insured with someone. So if there is a problem with anything that happens to your properties, what I would recommend is that anybody that lives on Granger Place, if this does go through, that you get pictures taken of your basement and of your foundations, because God forbid if there is a problem, you want to have an[sic] before and after [picture]. You don't want to come afterwards and there's a crack in there [foundation] and you have no way of proving that it happened,\" added Golombeck.\nMobius in housing court.\nAccording to Golombeck, the properties that Mobius owns have been \"in housing court on several occasions, but has a date of April 11, 2006 that he is going back [to court] for these properties. So it is in housing court and I wouldn't know Mr. Mobius if he walked in this room right now,\" stated Golombeck.\n\"I've gone after him on numerous occasions and everytime he gets out of housing court with a slap on the wrist. If I am a conspiracy theorist and say that there is a lot more going on than meets the eye. I can only get him into housing court. Once he's in housing court, the judge rules on it. Now I don't mean to take any shots at previous administrations, but I am hoping with the new administration, being in here, that the inspections department is going to be a much better department than it has been for the previous several years.\"\nCity Planning Board sends proposal back to Common Council.\nThe city's Planning Board on March 14, 2006, agreed to send the Elmwood Village Hotel proposal back to the Common Council so that it may \"be opened back up to discussion from the public.\"\nOn March 2, 2006 the Common Council sent the proposal \"to committee\" for further discussion and also requesting that the public be \"engaged further.\"\nDuring that meeting, Justin Azzeralla, Executive Director for Forwever Elmwood, said that the organization \"supports the hotel project.\"\nAlso on March 2, the planning board agreed to table, or postpone, any decision on the hotel proposal for at least thirty days, also citing the need for the public to be \"more engaged.\"\nThe Common Council is expected to meet on March 21, 2006 at 2:00pm local time where they may approve or deny the proposal.\nMajority of Common Council allegedly supports hotel proposal.\nAccording to \"The Buffalo News\", at least six Common Council members support the hotel project and are pledging to vote to approve it at the meeting on Tuesday, March 21.\nHowever, the city's Planning Board will get the final say on the project.

The resulting wave destroyed coastal highways, killed one person, and left seven others missing. The missing and dead count is expected to increase as searchers investigate the waters that flowed into the Pacific. Even though Kauai had received 5-6 inches of rain in the past day, most residents admitted that the island was not prepared for this situation. Although oil was spilled into the water, there has been no sighting of significant damage.\nThis dam break has many concerned about the possibility of another reservoir break, especially since most of Hawaii's reservoirs are at least a century old and privately owned. Engineers have begun to drain both the Morita and Waita Reservoirs, also on Kauai, to prevent any possible breaks. Although the governor stated that most of the responsibility for privately owned reservoirs belongs to the owners, she did admit that the state was also failing in its monitoring responsibilities, noting that the department in charge of monitoring reservoirs only has two employees. Although the primary owner, the Mary N. Lucas Trust, has made no comment, a partial owner, Mr. Jimmy Pflueger, has admitted he was devastated by the damage done by the reservoir.\nThe dam, 40 feet high and 80 feet long, released 300-400 million gallons of water, about 1400 acre-ft. Many tourists, as well as native residents, have been stranded without transportation, as the destruction of the main Lihue highway, the Kuhio Highway, has closed down the airport. The Coast Guard has taken over the main part of the search, although Hawaii National Guards has also been activated. Kauai County's mayor has declared Kauai to be in a state of emergency."}

And we will respond to requests from the Iraqi government.\"\nOverwatch was \"a support program\" that involved \"providing covering fire to coalition allies in Iraq.\" The Australian deployment was expected to end around July this year, but Dr Nelson has said the mission would now continue into next year. His statement followed the British announcement that it would withdraw 800 troops from Iraq in the next few months.\n\"The British and the Americans are looking at significant draw downs in two to three years. We haven't set any such timeline... I think we will be there into 2007... We haven't committed to another two to three years unlike the Americans. We take it on a day-to-day, week-to-week, month-to-month basis,\" said the Minister.\nDr Nelson ruled out Australian troops being deployed to more dangerous areas, such as Basra, where the British troops have been based. But he declined to say whether the new mission will be more risky. He says \"everything the troops do in Iraq is associated with danger.\"\nOn March 7th, Australian Greens Leader Bob Brown slammed the Howard government's determination to keep troops in Iraq, as American and British troops are withdrawn. \"Australian troops are being subject to thoughtless bravado by John Howard and Brendan Nelson and they need to be brought home immediately,\" Senator Brown said. \nOperation Catalyst is the Australian Defence Force (ADF) contribution to the rehabilitation and reconstruction of Iraq. Operation Catalyst currently comprises approximately 1320 Australian Defence Force personnel."}

Russia and China prefer a six-week deadline and want the report to go to the International Atomic Energy Agency, rather than to the Security Council. \nWhile the Security Council members agree that Iran should not be making nuclear weapons, they disagree on the course of action to take. Iran says that its nuclear program is for producing energy, but the IAEA has expressed a \"lack of confidence\" over Iran's intentions. Some nations in the west, including the U.S., claim that Iran's goal of nuclear energy production is a cover for nuclear bomb development.\nThe draft Security Council proposals cite \"the conviction that continued Iranian enrichment-related activity would intensify international concern.\" They reiterate that proliferation of weapons of mass destruction \"constitutes a threat to international peace and security.\" Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran's supreme leader, said the nuclear program is \"irreversible,\" and any retreat would endanger the Islamic republic's independence. Russia and China, on the other hand, are not as skeptical of Iran. They state that tough council action could cause Iran to withdraw from the and to ban inspectors sent from the International Atomic Energy Agency. \nFollowing last month's IAEA board report to the Security Council, expressing lack of confidence, Iran ended its voluntary cooperation with the IAEA under the Additional Protocol and said it would start uranium enrichment and bar surprise inspections of the facilities."}

You are a murderer,\" said the demonstrator before he was quietly escorted from the hall. \"I'm very glad to see that democracy is well and alive here at the university,\" she said.\nIn her speech, Rice sought to justify the U.S. occupation of Iraq, describing Iraqis as now more free. One student asked about abuses committed by U.S. forces at the Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq. She said the abuses had made her \"sick to her stomach.\" However, she defended Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, where human rights groups say detainees are held in inhumane conditions and in detention flouting international laws. \nBefore Rice began her speech, about 50 protesters were gathered at the front gates of the Conservatorium. The group were confronted by police on horseback and by police dogs. Police used the horses to charge into the group of activists and push them back, as a police helicopter hovered.\nA police spokeswoman said the group was blocking pedestrian access to the building and that police had spent more than 20 minutes warning them to move.

The Dominican-registered ship sank on March 6 near the Estonian coast in the Gulf of Finland.\nThis oil disaster may be even worse than the one of February, which was described by the BBC as the worst oil spill that Estonia has ever experienced. In the February spill, approximately 35 000 birds died. According to The Baltic Times, specialists say that this time up to 40 tons of oil might have leaked into the sea from the Runner 4. The ship was carrying, according to MTV3, over 100 tons of heavy fuel oil and 35 tons of light fuel oil.\nThe ship Runner 4 sank due to a collision with another ship, in a convoy following a Russian icebreaker. The crew managed to leave the ship before it sank.\nOn March 13, a week after the ship sank, the Estonian Border Guard sent its multipurpose vessel EVA-316 to the site to start the oil cleanup. Around the same time, the Finnish dedicated to the cleanup the oil spill response vessels \"Hylje,\" \"Halli\" and \"Seili\". Also, the Finnish Frontier Guard patrol ship Merikarku was sent to the site to conduct underwater robot examinations of the sunken ship. According to the Finnish Environment Institute press briefing on this, Estonia does not have adequate equipment for oil spill response in icy conditions, so help was needed.\nThe reaction to the disaster is criticized by Jouni Pirttij\u00e4rvi, an inspector at the Finnish Environment Institute (Ymp\u00e4rist\u00f6keskus). He says, according to Finland's national broadcasting company (YLE), that the countermeasures should have started a week ago, immediately after the disaster, instead of now. He said, \"It's difficult now to get the oil under control. It's spread all around, and ship traffic is spreading it further. We should have come here a week ago. Then the oil would have been closer to the disaster area [the ship's sinking site]. We weren't asked for help [by the Estonians] then, so now we decided to help without asking [before it's too late].\" (Translation from the Finnish-language original). \nFinland will be paying the costs of the cleanup, as Estonia did not make an official request for help. The Estonian Border Guard's representative Helena Loorents says that Finland was not asked for help, as every day spent in the cleaning costs a lot of money. Estonia simply cannot afford this.\nAccording to Urmas Raudsepp, the director of Estonia's Institute of Marine Research, the oil spill's location was only found out on Thursday March 16. The Finnish ships had, however, arrived at the site on the day before.\nJouni Pirttij\u00e4rvi also said that the conditions in the site are bad. The wind is over 17 meters per second (38 miles per hour) and it is raining. The oil spill is moving into waters too shallow for the three Finnish vessels, so they can no longer do their job. Hylje will be heading back to Finland on March 19 and the other two might follow within a few days. According to the Estonian paper Postimees, the oil spill is now a kilometer (0.6 mile) away from the Estonian capital of Tallinn."}

Other reports indicate that youths pelted police with objects, overturning and setting fire to a car at the end of the main protest in Paris. Police fired many rounds of tear gas. Demonstrations were also reported in Marseille, Rennes and Lille, where police charged and teargassed crowds.\nRally organisers estimate the turnout across the country at over a million people, with around 500,000 of them in Paris. However, the Interior Ministry reported 503,000 nationwide, with 80,000 in Paris.\nThe protesters are demanding that the Government withdraw the \"First Job Contract\" (CPE) \u2013 which allows employers to fire workers under the age of 26 without explanation in their first two years on the job. The aim of this new law is to encourage businesses to employ more young workers, given that their employment will be more flexible and convenient in economic terms. In the western city of Rennes, students wore plastic garbage bags with signs declaring: \"I am disposable.\" \nThe Paris march began with students in front and workers behind, but turned into a multi-generational mix including many parents who joined their teenage children. Banners declared \"No to throw-away youths\" and \"Tired Of Being Squeezed Lemons.\" The actions are only the third time in almost four decades \u2013 after 1968 and 1994 \u2013 that students and workers marched together.\n\"I risk working for two years for nothing, just to be fired at any moment,\" said Paris student Coralie Huvet, 20. Unemployment is currently a major political issue in France. The French national average is 9.6 percent, and youth unemployment is nearly 21 per cent. The rate rises to 40-50 percent in some of the poor suburbs hit by several weeks of youth rioting last year.\nRecent opinion polls show that 68 percent of French people oppose the new law, a rise of 13 percentage points in a week, and that French Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin's popularity has dropped six points to 37 percent.\nSince the beginning of March, protests, occupations and direct action against the new CPE employment law in France have been increasing, with university and school students leading the dissent. \nRailways have been blockaded, airports disrupted, and up to two thirds of France's universities have been occupied or disrupted, as well as many schools.

Destructive winds are expected to commence along the coast between Ingham and Port Douglas. Gales are already being experienced along the exposed coast in the warning area.\"\nTropical Cyclone Larry, currently building off far north Queensland, is expected to intensify before crossing the coast. Queensland tropical cyclone warning centre spokesman Bruce Gunn says people should treat warnings very seriously. \"This is the worst cyclone we have had for many, many years,\" he said.\nThe Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) says the cyclone poses a \"very serious threat to life and property\" and will now post warnings on the hour on its website.\nThe BOM also warns coastal residents between Cairns and Townsville of dangerous storm tide when the cyclone crosses the coast. The bureau says the sea is likely to steadily rise up to a level which will be significantly above the normal tide, with damaging waves, strong currents and flooding of low-lying areas extending some way inland. People living in those areas should be prepared to evacuate if advised by authorities.\nMandatory evacuations have been enforced in low-lying seafront areas, including in the Johnstone and Cardwell shires south of Cairns, which are expected to bear the force of Larry and its four metre storm surge.\nDisaster coordination centres have been activated in Cairns and Townsville. \"There have been mandatory evacuations of coastal shires south of Cairns ... and emergency shelters set up for people who feel at risk with nowhere to go,\" said a Cairns City Council Disaster Coordination Centre spokesman. \"It's most likely thousands of people are evacuating to avoid the high tide.\"\nPremier Peter Beattie has issued a disaster declaration.

The telephone survey of a nationwide random sample of 1136 adults was conducted March 9-12, 2006 and results were released on March 13. The maximum for results based on the full sample is plus or minus three percentage points. Some questions were only asked of half the sample. The poll was conducted shortly before the third anniversary of the US-led invasion of Iraq, and covered feelings about the war in Iraq and overall impressions of President Bush.\nA CNN-USA Today-Gallup poll also released on March 13 put the President's approval rate at 36%. Other polls conducted over a similar period had similar results, including those by NBC-Wall Street Journal and by Pew, reporting 37% and 33% approval respectively.\nIraq.\nThe CBS poll estimates that 47% of Americans think the eventual success in establishing democracy in Iraq is not at all or not very likely, an increase from 35% when polled on the same issue two months ago. The latest poll found that 15% answered that success is very likely, while 36% thought success is somewhat likely. Both these assessments have dropped from previous poll results of 21% and 42% respectively of those polled in January. \nMore than half believe that Iraq will never be a stable democracy, an increase from 39% who two months ago believed it could be stabilized. 5% believe Iraq will become a stable democracy in the next year or two. \n64% of Americans believe the outcome in Iraq will not affect security in the United States, compared to 28% who believe a positive outcome will deter terrorism in the United States. \nPoll results suggest that 71% of Americans believe that civil war is happening now in Iraq, and a majority say the war is not going well. 46% believe most Iraqi people now feel resentful of the U.S., up from 26% in April 2003, although this is a slight decrease from 48% in April 2004. In contrast, 32% say most Iraqis feel grateful, down from 53% in April 2003, and 13% say most Iraqis feel both grateful and resentful.\nWhen asked who is winning the war, 29% said the U.S., 12% said the Iraqi resistance and insurgents, and 53% said neither side. \nOn progress by the U.S. to train Iraqi troops to manage the conflict, the poll measured a decline from 54% in January to 41% now, although those who felt they didn't know enough to say increased from 26% to 35%. \nAccording to the poll, 50% of Americans do not believe the U.S. government is providing U.S. troops in Iraq enough resources to succeed, compared to 37% who do. However, 76% oppose reinstating the draft to provide additional soldiers for Iraq. According to the CBS report, 59% of Americans believe that the troop numbers should be decreased or that they should be removed entirely. However, 63% believe the troops will remain in Iraq for two or more years. The poll found that 44% of people believe that if the troops were withdrawn, violence in Iraq would increase, while 42% thought the violence would not change. Only 11% of people felt it would lead to less violence.\nAccording to the poll results, the majority of Americans, 54%, believe the U.S. should have stayed out of the war, and 70% believe the war is not worth the costs. A more narrow majority of 51% thought removing was not worth going to war. \nWhen asked why President Bush went to war, 21% said it was to protect the United States, 19% said to protect U.S. oil interests and 11% say to complete the Iraq war effort started by his .\nCBS report that 60% of Americans say the war has taken longer than expected, while only 4% say shorter. When asked whether the United States' military action in Iraq has made the U.S. safer from terrorism or not, 30% say it has made the U.S. more safe, 23% say it has made the U.S. less safe and 44% say it has made no difference. \nIn this poll, slightly more people say the war in Iraq is separate from the war on terrorism than say it is a major or a minor part of the war on terrorism. This is a reversal from the results in December 2005, when 43% of people said it was separate, while 53% said it was a major or minor part of the war on terror.\nPresident Bush's Approval Ratings.\nThe latest poll indicates that 57% of Americans now disapprove of President Bush's performance as president, an increase from 51% who disapproved of his performance two months ago, and a dramatic increase from disapproval ratings of 21% in April 2003. His job approval is now at 34%, down from 42% two months ago. In April 2003, just after the start of the war in Iraq, President Bush had a job approval rating of 73%. When broken down by party affiliation, CBS reports that his approval rating is now 74% among Republicans, 6% among Democrats and 28% among Independents.\nThe poll also found that more people disapprove than approve of the way Congress is handling its job. The approval rating for the President's handling of the war in Iraq is 31% and for foreign policy in general is 30%. Foreign-policy approval ratings vary by party affiliation, with 64% of Republicans approving, compared to 6% of Democrats and 24% of Independents. Similarly, 73% Republicans approve of the President's handling of the economy, compared to 9% of Democrats and 28% of Independents. \nThe poll indicates that nearly two-thirds of Americans believe President Bush says things are better in Iraq than they actually are, up to 66% from 58% in January, and less than one-fourth believe that President Bush describes things accurately. In comparison, 24% feel the media portray the situation in Iraq as better than it is. By contrast, 35% say the media description is accurate. \nCBS report that the war in Iraq is still seen as the nation's most significant problem. 41% of Americans see the Democratic Party as more likely to make the right decisions regarding Iraq, while 35% see the Republican Party as more likely. The poll results also indicated that a similar number of people approve and disapprove of the President's efforts against terrorism. In contrast, more people approved than disapproved of these efforts back in January, when 52% approved and 43% disapproved.\nBased on the latest CBS poll, nearly two thirds of Americans believe the country is on the wrong track, as opposed to a little over a quarter who believe the United States is on the right track. When divided by party affiliation, perception of being on the right track varies from 62% by Republicans to 20% by Independents to 8% by Democrats. When asked about companies from foreign countries operating U.S. ports, 42% say it is never okay, 17% said it is okay if the country was an ally, and 36% said it depends on the country."}

The official preliminary results are 82.6 percent for Lukashenko and six percent for the main opposition candidate , says the BBC. The turnout for the elections was 92.6 percent of Belarus' seven million eligible voters. The final results will be available Monday morning.\nBefore the elections, the opposition candidates accused Lukashenko of plans for rigging the elections. Several opposition newspapers were closed down and journalists were arrested some weeks before the elections. Many foreign observers, including the Polish, Finnish and Danish delegations, were refused entry into the country before the elections.\nApproximately 10 000 supporters of Milinkevich gathered in Oktyabrskaya Square in Belarus' capital, Minsk. According to the BBC, they shouted anti-Lukashenko slogans and waved flags that are banned under Lukashenko's regime. The protests have not involved violence so far. \nLukashenko previously warned people against the start of uprisings similar to recent ones witnessed in the Ukraine and Georgia. He said that people attempting to stage a coup will be treated as terrorists and will be executed. The European Union and the United States have expressed their concerns over allegedly authoritarian rule in Belarus. The EU is planning to deny visas to Belarusian officials with alleged involvement in election rigging, as a response to the denial by Belarus of entry into the country to EU election observers.\nMilinkevich demands new elections.

Belarus officials reject his demands, and insist the elections were free and honest. \nLukashenko denied being a dictator, saying \"... it's impossible to have a dictator in Europe.

This bill reforms the French code of intellectual property (CPI) and other laws, mostly in order to implement the 2001 .\nThe directive mandates legal protections of (DRM) measures against circumvention. DRMs are \"digital locks\" that prevent users from freely copying or playing contents, in order to enforce the copyright of the authors, artists, publishers and producers. The initial draft of the bill, proposed by , made circumvention of DRMs, or even facilitation thereof, a felony (\"d\u00e9lit\"), with a maximal penalty of 3 years in prison and/or a 300,000 fine as with . Since DRMs, circumvention and facilitations were not legally defined, it was feared that the law would effectively prevent competitors from creating players, especially based on , compatible with major systems such as 's or 's \u2014 or even to prevent the creation of any free software capable of loading files with DRM capabilities, that is, potentially most future text, audio or video .\nThe initial draft also conserved the threat of a counterfeiting felony conviction for those exchanging copyrighted files on the Internet. This was judged to be unfairly repressive and unrealistic. In France, it is commonplace for Internet users to have broadband up to 16 megabits per second in cheaply priced (\u20ac30 a month or lower) packages, often comprising phone and television ; millions of users, especially the young, are believed to use file sharing software. Lawmakers, from both the majority party and the opposition, found it unwise to turn millions of citizens into potential felons. As a consequence, the Minister proposed a \"gradual\" scheme where mere downloading of one file would be punishable by a \u20ac38 fine, which was adopted as an amendment. It remains to be seen how the law will be enforced.\nWith respects to DRMs, lawmakers from both the majority UMP party, the centrist and the opposition adopted amendments that make it compulsory for publishers of DRM-encumbered content to give the specifications to whomever would like to implement a compatible player. This proposal was decried by some US news sources as targeting Apple Computer's system, tied to the players. It is yet unknown, though, if these amendments would apply to companies that choose not to claim the new special protection awarded to DRMs by the law, which enable them to sue those who implement software meant to circumvent their protections.\nLawmakers also expressed concerns that the proposed law would weaken existing legal exceptions to copyright, especially the right for users to make copies of copyrighted files for private use (CPI L122-5).\nThe lawmaking process was quite a bumpy one. In December, lawmakers adopted a surprise amendment that would legalize peer-to-peer sharing as \"private copy\", much to the dismay of the Minister of Culture. The amendment, proposed by a bipartisan coalition of majority UMP and opposition lawmakers, was the first in a series that would have established a system known as the \"global license\" through which Internet users would have paid a flat fee in exchange for an authorization to use peer-to-peer services. The fees collected would be redistributed to authors and performers. In March, the Minister tried to withdraw article 1 of the law, which was the one that was amended to his dislike, but the next day he had to reintroduce it because withdrawing it may have been unconstitutional. The Assembly then voted the article down and adopted an Article 1 \"bis\", essentially an amended version of article 1 without the legalization of peer-to-peer sharing.\nThe law, initially presented as an uncontroversial, technical text, soon became a hot topic. Some lawmakers, both from the opposition and the majority, decried intense lobbying by the entertainment industry. Some amendments were nicknamed the \" amendment\", from the name of a major entertainment company that some lawmakers and commentators claim has inspired them. UMP lawmakers such as denounced pressures and even blackmail from some powerful lobbies.\nThe Assembly will very probably adopt the bill on March 21, despite the opposition of some UMP, UDF and opposition lawmakers. The bill will then be sent to the for further amendment and approval. Since the government declared the bill to be urgent, it is probably that after examination by the Senate, the bill will be sent to a mixed Assembly/Senate commission for harmonization, then finally voted. Given that some UMP and opposition lawmakers have voiced concerns about the constitutionality of some episodes of the lawmaking process, it is likely that the bill will get sent to the for constitutional review. Finally, Jacques Chirac is likely to sign it into law."}

For example, relief funding for the 26 December 2004 tsunami generally came rapidly and exceeded the amount requested, but famine relief for 3.5 million Kenyans suffering drought is now 75% underfunded.\nTo help solve these problems, the United Nations this month created the Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) as a rainy-day savings account, to be dipped into when urgent needs require that money be spent within days--not in several months after aid pledges start being fulfilled. The Fund is about half way to the goal of half a billion dollars in deposits, which could be spent for either natural or man-made disasters.\n\"We meet to launch a fund that is proactive rather than reactive. The CERF will provide a ready pool of resources that better empower the United Nations in funding immediate relief efforts in the aftermath of disasters,\" said UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan on March 9.\nJan Egeland, the UN Emergency Relief Coordinator, will manage the Fund. \"We are working on the two first allocations from the CERF...One is to the Horn of Africa and Kenya drought, the other one is to Cote d'Ivoire where humanitarian work and the civilian population is suffering so much,\" he said. \"Too often, aid resembles a lottery in which a few win but most lose based on considerations other than need.

However, they never gave up, rallying in the last inning, but just like Frederich Cepeda said, \u201cWe went and fought for this game just like every other game in this tournament, but Japan also went out and fought for this game.

Then a second round of begging tries to convert those pledges into actual payments. In the meantime, some relief is delayed, and people die. Money that does eventually come may not be in proportion to the need. For example, relief funding for the 26 December 2004 tsunami generally came rapidly and exceeded the amount requested, but famine relief for 3.5 million Kenyans suffering drought is now 75% underfunded. \nTo help solve these problems, the United Nations this month created the Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) as a rainy-day savings account, to be dipped into when urgent needs require that money be spent within days--not in several months after aid pledges start being fulfilled. The Fund is about half way to the goal of half a billion dollars in deposits, which could be spent for either natural or man-made disasters.\n\"We meet to launch a fund that is proactive rather than reactive. The CERF will provide a ready pool of resources that better empower the United Nations in funding immediate relief efforts in the aftermath of disasters,\" said UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan on March 9.\nJan Egeland, the UN Emergency Relief Coordinator, will manage the Fund. \"We are working on the two first allocations from the CERF...One is to the Horn of Africa and Kenya drought, the other one is to Cote d'Ivoire where humanitarian work and the civilian population is suffering so much,\" he said. \"Too often, aid resembles a lottery in which a few win but most lose based on considerations other than need. We must move from lottery to predictability so all those who suffer receive aid.\"\nThe biggest donations paid so far are $41 million from Sweden and $30 million from Norway. The largest pledges are $70 million from the United Kingdom and $24 million from the Netherlands."}

Queensland Premier Peter Beattie has declared a state of emergency in Innisfail and says he is worried about the outbreak of diseases. Army engineers are among more than 1,000 people assisting in Queensland's cyclone relief effort.\nPremier Beattie says it could be more than a week before power is restored in Innisfail. \"The whole bloody place is blown apart... this is going to be a long, slow recovery,\" he said. \nLarry caused widespread damage as it crossed the coast south of Cairns, with winds of up to 290km/h (180 mph). Thousands of buildings were damaged and most of the Australia's banana crop has been destroyed. Thousands of kilometres of power lines were brought down. Many key roads are flooded.\nState Emergency Service volunteers are putting tarpaulins on damaged homes. \"Some homes will need complete rebuilding and that will take many months. But right now let's get the bandaids out and get people settled as much as we can and then start the serious rebuilding of the Innisfail area.\" said Kathryn Ryan, from the Disaster Management Group\nHospitals are unable to cope with the lack of clean running water and reliable power supplies. There are concerns about outbreaks of dengue fever and other mosquito-borne diseases. \"Our main concern is with the quality of the drinking water, the quality of people's food supplies and any health risks from inundation by water,\" a health spokesman said.\nQueensland Health Minister Jim Guthrie says there is no electricity in Innisfail, the hardest hit town in Cyclone Larry's path. \"It's just too difficult to keep the hospital operating,\" he said. \"There's no mains power but they're also having trouble with generators - there's a lack of fuel.\"\nThe region's banana, sugar cane and avocado farm industries will need rebuilding. Jan Davis, of fruit growers' group Growcom, says Cyclone Larry will have widespread effects on the fruit industry. \nAmong supplies flowing in were nearly 10,500 gallons of water and 6,000 in-flight meals provided by Qantas. Troops also set up a water purification unit, and health authorities warned residents to boil their water. \"There most certainly would be around 7,000 people \u2026 that are effectively homeless,\" Federal Minister Bob Katter told The Associated Press. \"They're sitting in four walls but no roof.\" Some 17,000 homes were blacked out in Cairns.\nErgon Energy Regional services manager Geoff Bowes says generators have been sent to Innisfail to provide power for sewerage works and some supermarkets and extra staff have been flown in from Brisbane and Townsville. \"Nothing could prepare us for this,\" he said. \nThe Australian reports that building industry and government sources have estimated the cost of Larry as \"one of Australia's most costly natural disasters, with a damage bill expected to exceed $1.5 billion.\"\nSo far there have been no deaths or major injuries reported. Forecasters have warned of more wild weather for Queensland, with a second cyclone expected to approach the coast later this week. The Bureau of Meteorology say Tropical Cyclone Wati is moving towards the west-northwest at 13 km per hour and should gradually intensify over the next 24 hours."}

The weekend rallies and demonstrations drew smaller crowds than earlier anti-war demonstrations, when millions gathered in 2003 and 2004. US President George W. Bush, with dwindling public support for the war, marked the occasion with a speech, outlining his commitment to democracy in the region. \nIn the U.S.A..\nTens of thousands of protesters gathered this weekend across the United States to protest what they say is the continuing occupation of Iraq. Protestors called for accountability from the current administration. According to U.S. group, United for Peace and Justice, over 500 cities planned protests in all 50 U.S. states. \nIn Portland Oregon, about 10,000 anti-war protesters took almost an hour to pass through downtown streets on Sunday 19th March. Some carried signs reading: \"Impeach the Evildoer.\" On Saturday, more than 7,000 people marched through downtown Chicago. About 200 people gathered Sunday at Chalmette National Cemetery to protest the military conflict overseas. They say the war had hurt the country's ability to help New Orleans recover from hurricane disaster. Around 20 demonstrators were arrested in Washington, DC. About 200 joined a march Sunday along New York's Fifth Avenue. \nIn Toronto, Canada some 1,000 protesters converged opposite the U.S. consulate. In Ottawa, dozens of demonstrators gathered two blocks from Parliament Hill and later at the National Gallery to protest the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Several hundred protesters marched through downtown Halifax. Protests in Montreal and Vancouver also attracted hundreds. \nIn Seoul, 1,000 people demonstrated - urging the South Korean government to bring their troops home. South Korea has 3,200 troops in northern Iraq - the largest contingent of foreign troops after the US and Britain. In Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, about 600 people protested peacefully - in contrast to the 2005 gathering when police fired on demonstrators with water cannons. In Tokyo, about 800 demonstrators took to the streets, after some 2000 protested the day earlier.\nAbout 1,000 protesters gathered near New York's Times Square at a rally where speakers denounced the Bush administration and the continuing US troop presence in Iraq. The demonstrations were organised by many diverse groups. \nGlobal Action.\nMany more thousands also gathered in cities around the globe, including in the Iraqi cities of Basra and Baghdad. In Rome tens of thousands took to the streets, with signs: \"Stop the war in Iraq\" and \"No to the war for oil.\" Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, a supporter of US President George W. Bush, sent nearly 3,000 Italian soldiers to Iraq despite the objections of a majority of Italians.\nIn London, police estimated a crowd of at least 15,000 showed up for the anti-war march. The city's Mayor Ken Livingstone made an appearance at the event in Trafalgar Square which peace groups had organised to demand the immediate withdrawal of 8,000 British troops, the second largest military contingent after the United States in Iraq.\nA turnout of several thousand people was reported in Denmark, Greece, Spain and Turkey. In Athens, nearly 2,000 protesters marched to the US embassy, led by Palestinian immigrants who chanted anti-American slogans, \"Get the imperialists out of Iraq and Afghanistan\" and \"Bush is terrorist Number One\". Protests were also held outside US facilities at Souda military base on the island of Crete and in Greece's second city of Salonika.\nDemonstrators in Istanbul, led by leftist and Islamist groups, called for the American troops to pull out of Iraq with banners saying \"United States, go home\". Communist party officials in Portugal organised an anti-war rally in Lisbon, claiming solidarity with \"the fight of the Iraqi people\". In Copenhagen, some 3,000 people marched in the streets, organisers and police said, with banners reading \"Bring back the troops now\". Demonstrators rallied outside the US embassy before marching on to the British embassy. Police said one person was arrested.\nPeace activists staged a peaceful march in Geneva where one of the anti-war organisers said that \"there is even less legitimacy to the American presence in Iraq today than there was three years ago\". In Stockholm where a few hundred people braved the cold and falling hail to gather at an outdoor rally in the Swedish capital, the mother of a British soldier killed in Iraq took the stage, putting the blame on the US and British leaders. In Barcelona, Spain, 2,000 people - according to police - joined a march protesting the war. \nAustralia.\nIn Australia actions drew around 1,000 people in both Sydney and Melbourne demonstrated, with smaller rallies in other cities. Reports in Perth indicate between 500 and 1000 people took part in a demonstration.\nThe government still has over 1,300 troops on duty in and around Iraq. In February, Prime minister John Howard announced an additional 450 ADF troops will be sent to Iraq, despite other countries withdrawing numbers. Mr Howard justified the reversal of policy as being in the \"broader interests of democracy in the Middle East\". \nAustralia's oppostion Defence Spokesman Robert McClelland said it's a \"question of resources\". For instance, we've spent $1.2 billion on the war in Iraq to date, and that's more than we spend each year on the entire Australian Federal Police budget,\" he said. \"Australian people are very concerned that we're going to be sucked along into a civil war situation in Iraq.\" \n\"The truckloads of tortured, mutilated bodies, smashed infrastructure and cost of the Iraq war now approaching one trillion Australian dollars are outcomes of the Prime Minister's decision to back President Bush's invasion 3 years ago,\" Greens Leader Bob Brown said.\nA Hawker Britton opinion poll suggests that almost two thirds of Australians want ADF troops to leave Iraq within the next couple months. Last week, visiting US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice was heckled by campaigners in Sydney, who accused her of \"war crimes\" and having \"blood on her hands\".\nUS President maintains \"reason for hope\".\nPresident Bush marked the third anniversary of the start of Operation Iraqi Freedom with a speech given in Cleveland, Ohio. Elaborating on the effort to build democracy in Iraq Mr Bush said, \"We are implementing a strategy that will lead to victory... the United States will not abandon Iraq,\" he said. \"Americans have never retreated in the face of thugs and assassins, and we will not begin now.\"\nAccording to Bloomberg, President Bush is giving a series of speeches aimed at \"rallying Americans behind his policies.\" The U.S. has 133,000 troops in Iraq. U.S. military deaths in Iraq have surpassed 2,300. Public support for the war is falling and the cost of the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan rising to $9.8 billion a month. \nThe President told the audience: \"in the face of continued reports about killings and reprisals\" he could \"understand how some Americans have had their confidence shaken,\" he said. \"Others look at the violence they see each night on their television screens, and they wonder how I can remain so optimistic about the prospects of success in Iraq. They wonder what I see that they don't.\" He alluded to the northern Iraqi city, Tal Afar. He said the city \"was once a key base of operations for al Qaeda and is today a free city that gives reason for hope for a free Iraq.\"\nMuch of downtown Cleveland where Mr Bush spoke was barricaded off by Police. About 100 anti-war protesters chanted for the president to leave. The group held signs with peace messages and beat drums. \nFour polls published last week put Bush's approval ratings at an all-time low - somewhere between 33 and 36 per cent. A CNN/Gallup poll has his approval rating at 36 per cent. The Pew Centre's poll put approval at 33 - the lowest rating of his presidency.\nU.S. Defence Secretary Donald Rumsfeld wrote in the Washington Post on Monday, arguing the Iraqi insurgency was failing. He wrote: \"Turning our backs on post-war Iraq today would be the modern equivalent of handing post-war Germany back to the Nazis.\" Vice President Dick Cheney also \"remains optimistic about the outcome of the US involvement.\"\nIraq Conflict continues.\nThree years on, with 2,300 Americans killed, 17,000 troops injured, somewhere between 30,000 and 100,000 Iraqis killed and the onset of \"civil war,\" the US occupation of Iraq costs $200 million each day. \nMeanwhile the conflict continues in Iraq. On Tuesday around 100 Iraqi insurgent fighters, armed with automatic rifles and rocket-propelled grenades, stormed a jail near Baghdad, killing at least 17 policemen. Authorities said all 33 prisoners were freed and 10 attackers were killed. After burning the police station, the group detonated roadside bombs as they fled. At least 13 policemen and civilians and 15 gunmen were wounded in the attack. \nA recent wave of violence has left more than 1,000 Iraqis dead since the bombing last month of a Shiite Muslim shrine."}

Now, allegations have been brought against the French riot police Compagnies R\u00e9publicaines de S\u00e9curit\u00e9 (CRS). Eyewitnesses report that officers of the CRS kicked 39-year-old Cyril Ferez while he was lying on the ground. A report of a CRS-officer draws a different picture of the incident.\nThe incident happened during the evacuation of the Place de la Nation by the CRS at the end of the demonstration against the first employment contracts at about 8.30 p.m. Cyril Ferez works for the Orange telecommunication company in Torcy and is a member of the trade union Sud-PTT, which represents workers at post offices and telecommunication companies. According to the photographer Bruno Stevens, Cyril Ferez was running away from the police, together with some other demonstrators. \"He was slower. He was hit directly on the head. He collapsed like a sack. They hit him further while he was lying on the ground,\" the photographer told the French newspaper Lib\u00e9ration. While he was hit by the police, he did not react in any hostile way towards them, said another photographer, Victor Tonelli. The police are said to have hit the demonstrator with night sticks and with their feet. The trade union Sud-PTT accuses the police of not having called for medical help for the injured person, despite having been called to do so. The trade union demands an official meeting with the home secretary on Wednesday afternoon and calls the behaviour of the police as not being worthy of the government of a democratic state. According to a report of the press association Reuters, the seriously injured person was immediately hospitalised. According to members of the government, referring to the treating doctors, Cyril Ferez was admitted to the hospital Henri-Mondor de Cr\u00e9teil with 2.7 grammes of alcohol in his blood. According to a report of a CRS-officer, with a copy of it on hand of the press association AFP and relying on statements of Cyril Ferez (before he fell into his coma), the injuries are not a result of a fight between CRS-officers and Cyril Ferez. According to this report, Cyril Ferez was attacked by other demonstrators. The report was given to the police audit. Members of the opposition party and the trade unions demand a complete clearing up of the incident.\nOn Sunday morning, Cyril Ferez fell into a coma. The police audit \"Inspection g\u00e9n\u00e9rale des services\" wants to investigate the incident. Therefore, the police audit would like to find out which witnesses were on site and which officers of the CRS were involved in the incident. Doctors assume that Cyril Ferez, if he survives, will suffer from neurological consequences. Directly after the demonstration, the police prefecture had claimed that 18 demonstrators had been injured, but that there was no seriously injured person among them.\nFrench trade unions and student organisations have announced a general strike for 28 March. On Saturday, about 1.5 million people participated in the countrywide demonstrations against CPE."}

The machine is designed to help bridge the digital divide in China and to expand China's small domestic semiconductor industry. Its development has been heavily subsidized by local governments.\nThe Municator measures 14.5 x 18 x 3.7 cm. (5.7 x 7.1 x 1.5 in.), and weighs 0.65 kg. (1.4 pounds). It is expected to use an existing TV as a monitor. The operating system is a GNU/Linux distribution, known as Thinix 3.0, which is developed by YellowSheepRiver Inc. itself and overseen by the Chinese government for security reasons. The Municator was shown last week at the 2006 CeBIT Fair in Hannover, Germany.\nVideo coverage from CeBIT 2006 speculated that the Municator will include applications such as: Firefox for web browsing, Thunderbird for e-mail, Gaim for instant messaging, Skype for VoIP, Red Office (99 percent compatible with Microsoft Office and based on Open Office) for Linux for word processing, and MPlayer for audio/video playback. The Skype application for VoIP is currently only available from Skype on i386-32 processors under Linux, but CeBit's video briefly shows a beta version of Skype running on the Municator's screen.\nThe 64-bit Godson 2c 400-800 MHz CPU used in the machine has a MIPS-like instruction set, and is roughly as fast as a 500-mHz Pentium III. The Godson II is made exclusively in China, and consumes relatively little power for its speed in comparison to x86 Intel and compatible AMD chips.

Among the items in the agenda was the Elmwood Village Hotel proposal.\nThe Elmwood Village Hotel is a proposed hotel by Savarino Construction Services Corporation and is designed by architect Karl Frizlen of the Frizlen Group. It is to be placed on the corner of Elmwood and Forest Avenues in Buffalo and will require the demolition of at least five properties (1109-1121 Elmwood).\nDuring the hour-and-a-half meeting, the Common Council approved the hotel proposal. The entire voting process for the proposal took less than two minutes, and the public was not allowed to speak. The Council voted unanimously in support of the proposal; however, the city's Planning Board must also approve the proposal. The Board will meet on Tuesday, March 28, 2006 at 8:00 a.m. on the 9th floor of City Hall, room 902.\nThe approval allows for the rezoning of all five properties, including 605 Forest, to a \"special development plan,\" or a C-2 zone. \n\"There is a 'special development plan' in front of the council, which changes only one thing about the zoning. It allows one permitted use \u2014 for just a hotel. The rest of the zoning remains as it is under the current Elmwood Business District zoning. 605 and 607 Forest are not required for the project. They are not part of the footprint for the project. Let me answer this question again. This is on the record, in council: 605 needs to be rezoned in order to facilitate the project because of the sideyard requirement. Anything in C-2 is excluded besides the hotel. So we've taken the C-2 and included the hotel as a permitted use, and excluded everything else, and everything else remains the same,\" Eva Hassett, Vice President of Savarino Consrtruction, said to \"Wikinews\" during a public meeting on March 16, 2006.\nHowever, during the same meeting, Pano Georgiadis, owner of 605 Forest and owner of Pano's Restaurant on Elmwood, threatened to \"sue\" Savarino Construction saying, \"If you try to get a variance to change the code, I will sue you. This is my home, number one.\"\nSavarino Construction hopes to break ground this Summer.\nResidents and business owners will still fight.\nDespite the Council's approval, organizers have scheduled another protest that will be held this Saturday, March 25, 2006 at 2:00 p.m. on Forest and Elmwood.\nSome citizens are even considering legal action and are considering an \"injunction in State Supreme Court,\" going \"pro se, meaning I am going to present the case myself,\" said Clarence Carnahan, a concerned citizen and local business owner who is opposed to the hotel, to \"Wikinews.\"\nCarnahan wrote a \"notice of cease and desist\" which was also presented to the Council at today's meeting.\nPatty Morris, co-owner of Don Apparel with Nancy Pollina, said, \"We are going to fight the good fight to the bitter end, but we cannot afford it [legal action].

A video release by the organization shows three people seated at a table in front the ETA emblem, faces covered with masks and wearing Basque berets. The video was broadcast on Spanish national television and distributed to local Basque media outlets. \nETA, Western Europe's most active separatist group, seek to create an independent state covering Spain's northern Basque Country and parts of south-western France. The group broke two ceasefires in the 1990s.\nFor over three decades the armed organisation has waged a violent campaign for independence for the seven regions in northern Spain and south-west France that Basque separatists claim as their own. ETA, whose name stands for Basque Homeland and Freedom, originated in the 1960s as a student resistance movement bitterly opposed to General Franco's repressive military dictatorship.\nETA is considered by Spain, France, the European Union and the United States to be a terrorist organization, with more than eight hundred killings attributed to it.\nA permanent end to hostilities by ETA was a condition set by the Socialist Government of Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero for beginning negotiations with the organisation.\nEdited text of ETA cease-fire statement.\n\"(Translated/edited from Spanish by Wikinews)\"\nEuskadi Ta Askatasuna (ETA) has decided to declare a permanent cease-fire from 00:00 AM on the 24 of March 2006. \nReflection of ETA \nThe objective of this decision is to impel democratic process in Basque Country so that by means of dialogue, negotiation and agreement, Basque can make the necessary political change. \nIt is necessary to construct a democratic framework for Basque Country, recognizing the rights that Basque corresponds to, and to assure the potential development all political options. At the end of that process the citizens and Basque citizens should have their right to speak and the ability to make decision on their future - enabling democratic solutions to the conflict. \nETA considers that it corresponds to all the Basque agents to develop this process and to adopt the agreements corresponding to the future of Basque Country, considering their plurality and totality. The Spanish and French States must recognize the results of this democratic process, without interference or limitation. The decision that Basque citizens we adopt for our future will have to be respected. \nCall of ETA \nWe must assume responsibilities, to construct the democratic solutions that Basque needs. It is the moment for making decisions from openwork, and dialogue of the facts. ETA makes a call to the authorities of Spain and France to respond positively to this new situation; and so that they do not set up obstacles to the democratic process, leaving aside repression and showing the will to give a negotiated exit to the conflict. \nFinally, we make a call to the citizens and Basque citizens in general and to the militants of the Abertzale Left, so that they are implied in this process.\nCommitment of ETA \nETA has shown desire and willingness, from an open process until the end, and thus to obtain to a true democratic situation for Basque country, surpassing the conflict of long years and constructing a peace based on justice. \nWe reaffirmed commitment to take agreed steps in to that will and continuing fighting until obtaining the rights of Euskal Herria the future. The overcoming of the conflict, here and now, is possible. \nThat is the desire and the will of ETA. - In Euskal Herria (Basque Country), March 2006 - Euskadi Ta Askatasuna\nSources.\n "}

Everyone had set out by three p.m., the crowd being compact.\nRetired people, post-highschool students, highschool students and employees all gathered to protest against the government's bill establishing the \"Contrat Premi\u00e8re Embauche,\" \u2014 First Employment Contract.\nA security service provided by the unions maintained order more or less well. Even so, an impressive body of very visible police sought to prevent any excess.\nThe first demonstrators arrived about five p.m. at the Place de la Nation, in a festive atmosphere. \nIn the procession were musicians, grimy youths and colorful banners. Along the edges of the procession and at the Place de la Nation could even be seen sellers of sandwiches and drinks.\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nExcesses.\nToward six p.m., some hooded youths began to confront the forces of order massed at the edges of the Place de la Nation. They threw bottles and pyrotechnical devices and burned a car. The confrontation, which lasted at least until eight p.m., produced one serious injury \u2014 a SUD-PTT union member, who it seems was struck by members of the CRS security force.\nSome demonstrators at first sought to place themselves between the ruffians and the police, but they had to give it up, faced with the barrage of bottles.\nAfter the automobile fire, around seven p.m., the mobile gendarmes charged, in order to establish a security perimeter around the vehicle on fire, to permit the firemen to extinguish it. In view of the small distance that separated the \"forces of order\" from the brigands when they burned the car, one can ask why the mobile gendarmes did not try to prevent this act of gratuitous vandalism.\nThe police charged several times and threw tear gas. By eight p.m., the confrontations still continued, and a mobile gendarme said that the objective was to make the demonstrators leave the Place de la Nation.\nA strange impression is felt when this sort of occurrence breaks out in a demonstration that was until then well-mannered. It is like thunder from a blue sky. \nThe crowd suddenly opened, and the hooligans were there, ready to come unglued, the crowd of demonstrators transforming themselves into rubberneckers around the protagonists of the confrontation.\nOnce again, a few provocateurs, undoubtedly fewer than about thirty, caused a movement of several tens of thousands of people to get out of hand."}

Duckworth's victory earns her a spot in the race against Republican state Senator Peter Roskam, who won the Republican nomination to replace retiring Congressman Henry Hyde. \nCegalis ran for the seat in 2004, garnering 44% of the vote, the best achieved by a Democrat against Hyde. Working off of momentum gathered in that race, she continued to increase her grassroots organization and her Internet campaigning to gain support from Democrats across the nation. Cegalis, a software engineer, was running unopposed for the nomination until Duckworth joined the race in December. Supported by the Democratic establishment, Duckworth quickly out-fundraised her opponents, receiving support from prominent Democrats such as John Kerry, Hillary Clinton, Rahm Emmanual, and Barack Obama. \nThe race became strongly contested between self-proclaimed progressive activists supporting Cegalis and Democrats who preferred to work with the party candidate. Duckworth, who lost her legs in Iraq in 2004, received a strong showing of support from outside the district, including large fundraisers in New York and Chicago. \nScott, a former pastor of an evangelical church in Des Plains, attempted to paint the race in religious terms. His campaign was run on the principle that he could win votes through his moderate, religious views, which he said would attract Republican voters in the district. "}

Bonds continues to insist that he did not realize his trainer was giving him steriods. He claimed in his grand jury testimony that he thought he was receiving flaxseed oil and an arthritis salve. Sheffield's response to the claims was quite simple: when asked if the allegations made against him were true, his response was \"Nope.\"\nDespite the book's accusations of Sheffield and Giambi, it centers around Bonds and the founder of the Bay Area Laboratory Co-Operative or BALCO, Victor Conte Jr. Conte is currently serving four months in prison for distribution of steriods and money laundering.

The group accuse the Indonesian military of \"conducting genocide in their homeland.\" The 36 adults and seven children spent five days at sea in a traditional outrigger boat before arriving in far north Queensland's Cape York. They have been since been detained under Australia's Mandatory Detention policy.\nImmigration Minister Amanda Vanstone said the 42 West Papuans have been given temporary protection visas (TPV). \"These people have completed their medical and character checks and will be moved into the community,\" she said. Most of the group are being relocated by private jet from Australia's remote immigration detention centre on Christmas Island to Melbourne. Senator Vanstone said a decision was still pending on one of the asylum seekers, as there were further specific case issues to be addressed. \nHowever, the Indonesian government says the refugees should be sent back. Indonesia's President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono has told Prime Minister John Howard that the group should not be given political asylum. He assures that they would not be prosecuted. Last month, Indonesia's ambassador, Hamzah Thayeb, warned that Australia's relationship with Indonesia would be affected if the Papuans were granted asylum.\nA spokesman for Foreign Minister Alexander Downer dismissed suggestions that the decision would cause a rift between Australia and Jakarta. \"We've got an excellent bilateral relationship with Indonesia and we wouldn't expect that any particular issue is going to bring that into question,\" he said. Mr Downer personally informed his Indonesian counterpart, Hassan Wirajuda, of the decision. \"It's a matter of some significance between our two countries,\" said Mr Downer.\nIndonesia has insisted that there are no human rights abuses in Papua. Djoko Susilo, a member of Indonesia's parliamentary foreign affairs commission, labelled the decision \"an unfriendly gesture by the Australian Government.\"\nSince their arrival, the 43 West Papuans have accused the Indonesian military of \"genocide in their homeland,\" taken over by Indonesia in the 1960s after a widely disputed independence referendum.\nHerman Wainggai, who spoke for the asylum-seekers, thanked the Australian Government and people for a fair and just decision. \"We were threatened in an extremely dangerous position ... We had to flee to Australia from the intimidation of the killing and the persecution inflicted by Indonesian authorities against us,\" he said. \n\"We trust that Indonesia will act with maturity and see that the situation in West Papua is very serious and one which must be dealt with peacefully and with humanity, not by violent means,\" he said. \nThe Indonesian House of Representatives (DPR) has denounced the Australian government's decision, urging the government to send a formal protest note to the Australian government over the visas and political asylum granted to the 42 Indonesian citizens. \"We question the decision to grant visas and political asylum at a time when the security situation in Papua province is tense,\" said member of the House Commission I for defence, foreign and information affairs Effendy Mara Sakti, of the Indonesian Democratic Party-Struggle (PDIP).\nAnother House Commission member, Yudy Chrisnandy of the Golkar Party, said the granting of political asylum and temporary visas was unethical and could disrupt relations between the two countries. \nAmnesty International has expressed particular concern about human rights violations in Papua, but welcomed the decision. \"While welcoming today's decision ... Amnesty now encourages the government to consider the plight of the Papuan refugees, as under Australia's temporary protection regime the refugees now face isolation from their families left behind and face uncertainty about their future,\" the organisation said in a statement. Amnesty reports of \"extrajudicial executions, 'disappearances,' torture, ill-treatment and arbitrary detentions in Papua Province.\" \nAustralian Greens Senator Kerry Nettle also welcomed the decision. \"The situation in West Papua is clearly very dangerous for those who assert their right to self-determination, so the decision to grant protection visas is a good one,\" Senator Nettle said. \nWest Papua have been seeking sovereignty since the United Nations handed the province to Indonesia in 1969. A spokesman for the Free West Papua Campaign, Nick Chesterfield, said the decision highlights the dire situation. \"What this clearly demonstrates is that the world needs to wake up to what is happening in West Papua and start to actively look at ways of ending the sickening violence that the Indonesian military continues to inflict on the people of West Papua,\" Mr Chesterfield said. \n\"Rather than being isolated and locked up thousands of miles away on Christmas Island, these very courageous individuals can receive the support they deserve from the local community. This decision also means Australians will be able to hear first hand about the atrocities and escalating human right abuses that are unfolding in one of our closest neighbouring countries,\" said Mr Chesterfield. \nMeanwhile, the \"Morning Star\" flag of West Papua was raised in Marrickville, New South Wales, by Senator Nettle and the Mayor of Marrickville, Sam Byrne. The flag, officially unrecognised by Indonesia in the West Papuan region, was raised to \"urge city citizens to support self-determination for the West Papuans people.\" \nUniting Church minister Reverend John Barr, who recently returned from the area, warned of an \"intensification of violence\" and also recounted demands from protesters to have the Freeport mine and the Indonesian government held responsible for despoiling the Papuan environment. \"We have heard one student was shot dead and many are badly wounded. I could hear people yelling and fleeing as my contact spoke to me on the phone from the grounds of the theological seminary,\" he said in a statement.\nMedia ban.\nThe Jakarta Foreign Correspondents Club has stated concern that no foreign journalist has had official access to Papua in the past eighteen months. In that period there has been \"a significant build-up of troops in Papua with reports of widespread displacement of civilians, arson, and arbitrary detention in the central highlands region.\" \nLast week, Indonesian media showed police shooting directly at students on local university grounds. Authorities have not released details of casualties among the demonstrators. \"I can't tell you exactly how many were shot,\" says Hans Magel. \"In such traumatic circumstances, we ourselves are finding it difficult gathering casualty figures. The latest information we have is that 22 were seriously injured.\"\nIndonesia has effectively maintained a ban on access to Papua for many foreign organisations since 2003. Indonesia\u2019s Minister of Defense, Juwono Sudarsono, said in February that the government will \"maintain curbs on foreign media\" reporting from Papua. He is quoted as saying, \"We feel that our unity and cohesion are being threatened by the presence of foreign intrusion and concerns so there is a balance between international concerns and sovereignty that we want to strike very peacefully.\" \nMinister Sudarsono also stated that the curbs should \"extend to foreign nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and churches, whom he thought might create conflict in the province by encouraging Papuans to campaign on issues of human rights.\" He stated that he feared reporters could be \"used as a platform\" by Papuans to publicize the alleged abuses. \nKen Roth, Executive Director of Human Rights Watch, is alarmed at efforts by the Indonesian government to ban or limit press coverage of human rights violations and other issues in Papua. In a letter to President Yudhoyono, Roth urged the Indonesian government to respect press freedom and to allow full press coverage of all issues affecting the province. \nSenior Indonesian ministers have vehemently denied that the people of West Papua are being repressed."}

According to the Bangkok Post, approximately 1,000 PAD protesters rallied outside the election commission's headquarters to mark delivery of the petition.\nParinya Thewanarumitkul, a law lecturer at Thammasat University, claimed at a Thai Journalists Association forum that he had evidence that the PM had abused his position by using government resources to aid in the organisation of a March 3 rally of Thai Rak Thai supporters. In addition, Parinya expressed doubt that the required 500 MPs would be returned, due to the main opposition party election boycott and the requirement for 20% of the eligible electorate to vote for a candidate, even when the candidate stands unopposed.\nThailand's Democrats, the current main opposition party, who are boycotting the April 2 election, raised doubts over the validity of a number of Thai Rak Thai candidates' listings. Calling for the Election Commission to investigate these allegations, Pichai Rattanadilok na Phuket of the National Institute of Development Administration also highlighted the 46 constituencies where the Prime Minister's party stands unopposed, viewing vote buying as a possibility in these areas.\nAccording to Democrat claims, over 200 people who applied to be on ballots failed to meet the requirement to have maintained party membership for 90 days prior to the announcement of the election. It isn't just the candidates of smaller parties that have caught the eye of the Democrat panel examining candidate credentials. They claim that at least three of the Thai Rak Thai candidates should be disenfranchised due to having not voted during the 2005 election. The three accused \u2014 including the party's deputy leader \u2014 dispute the claim that they failed to vote. Party deputy Somchai Sunthornvat claimed it was a person with the same name who had failed to vote, and threatened to sue the Democrat party for making the allegation.\nWhile PAD protesters demonstrated away from Government House, the beleaguered PM returned unnanounced from his election campaigning in the country's northeast. In addition to his having been continuingly called upon leave office, his key privatisation policies had been dealt a serious blow by the ruling that the privatisation of the state-owned power company EGAT was unlawful.\nJudges overturned two royal decrees that had been the foundation of the plan for Thailand's largest ever IPO. Supporters of the eleven civic groups that had filed the petition with the court greeted the decision with cheers. Mention of conflicts of interest in the privatisation process adds fuel to the accusations of anti-Thaksin groups, who accuse the PM of leading a government that indulges in cronyism."}

Another group of scientists, based at the University of Rotterdam, has also published similar results.\nProfessor Kawaoka's team discovered that bird flu tends to be found among alveoli deep in the lungs. Human flu is instead most prevalent in the mucous lining of the nose and sinuses, as well as the throat, windpipe and bronchi.\nHuman flu infects parts of the respiratory system that cause coughing and sneezing. When an infected person coughs or sneezes, tiny droplets containing the virus are released into the air, which other humans can inhale, becoming infected. As bird flu infects the alveoli, it doesn't cause coughing or sneezing, and heavy exposure to the virus is required before it can get to the lungs.\nProfessor Kawaoka said, \"For the viruses to be transmitted efficiently, they have to multiply in the upper portion of the respiratory system so that they can be transmitted by coughing and sneezing.\"\nFor H5N1 to be transmitted easily among humans, it would need to undergo multiple mutations, according to Professor Kawaoka.\n\"Certainly, multiple mutations need to be accumulated for the H5N1 to become a pandemic strain,\" he said.\nThese mutations would have to affect where the virus binds in the human body and affect the way in which it reproduces.\nCurrently only one strain of H5N1, A/Hong Kong/213/03, has shown the ability to latch onto cells in both the upper and lower parts of the human respiratory system."}

The rocket took the prototype aircraft to an altitude of 314km (195 mi) before crashing ten minutes later, a spokeswoman for the Hyshot program said. A supersonic boom was felt across the Woomera test range seconds after the jet took off. \nThe Queensland-led HyShot III experiment uses a scramjet engine developed by UK company, QinetiQ. Travelling at 8,000 km/h (~5000 mph), or ten times the speed of a conventional jet, and almost eight times the speed of sound (Mach 8), the rocket turned and powered back to Earth some 400 km (250 mi) down the range. The scientists are hoping the scramjet kicked into action during a six-second window shortly before impact.\nThe advantage of a scramjet is that once it is accelerated to about Mach 4 by a conventional jet engine or booster rocket, it can fly at hypersonic speeds, possibly as fast as Mach 15, without carrying heavy oxygen tanks, as conventional rockets do.\nTeam leader Professor Allan Paul says that the flight went well, but that it will take several months to analyse the collected data. He told the media it was too soon to tell if the $2 million experiment had been a success. \nAnother HyShot team member Michael Smart said the flight followed the nominal trajectory and impacted 400 km (250 mi) from its launch pad. Dr Smart said that radar tracking data showed the experiment had gone to plan.\nProfessor Paull said scramjet-powered passenger jets were still a long way off, but it might be possible to have a scramjet-powered vehicle within the next decade. He says the team is happy with the result so far.\nNASA set the speed record for a jet-powered aircraft in [November 2004] during the third and final flight of the experimental X-43A scramjet project. \nTwo HyShot scramjet flights had previously been made\u2014one on 30 October 2001 and another on 30 July 2002.

A sign written in English has been posted on the fence of Government House reading \"For Rent\". \nA poll released this week showed Bangkok people are becoming fed up after weeks of rallying. Today's rally was a \"united call\" on King Bhumibol Adulyadej to replace Thaksin. The palace reports that the king is following events closely but says there are no signs he will act against Thaksin. The monarch has intervened publicly twice in his 60-year reign. The campaigners want the king to appoint a neutral government to carry out political reforms.\nThe three main opposition parties are boycotting the election, declaring the electoral process \"unfair\" as Thaksin has taken over the independent institutions. Thaksin, once the richest man in Thailand, transferred ownership of his companies to family members and employees prior to becoming Prime Minister. \nThe weekly rallies in Bangkok, numbering in the hundreds of thousands, make the movement to depose the troubled Thaksin the \"largest massing of public dissent since 1992,\" when huge demonstrations and the army's subsequent massacre of protesters culminated in the end of military rule in Thailand.\nThe latest rally on Saturday launched a series of protests due to continue with a march through the main shopping district. The protestors will converge on police headquarters on Monday to demand criminal charges be brought against the prime minister. \nPolice would be stationed at the rally site, near his office, and at other key government offices, national police spokesman General Achirawit Suphanaphesat said. Thaksin, who has been accused of clamping down on dissent and stifling freedom of the press, vowed to call a state of emergency if protests turn violent."}

He was 76. \nFamily spokesman Jim Shaw made the announcement. \nConsidered by many the original rhinestone cowboy, Owens was responsible for over 20 number one hits including his first, \"Act Naturally,\" in 1963, \"Together Again,\" and \"I've Got a Tiger by the Tail\". Most of his biggest hits were released from the mid 1960's to mid 1970's. Among the numerous recording artists who recorded his songs were Emmylou Harris, the Beatles, who recorded \"Act Naturally\", and Dwight Yoakam, who had a 1988 duet with Owens on \"Streets of Bakersfield\". Many of these artists made hits for themselves as well with his songs. He was mentioned in cameo-passing during the Creedence Clearwater Revival song \"Lookin' Out My Backdoor\".\nHe transformed country music with his honky-tonk \"Bakersfield Sound\", so named for the town of his residence 100 miles north of Los Angeles where he moved in 1951. With Roy Clark, he co-hosted the long-running popular television comedy country-themed musical variety show \"Hee-Haw\" from 1969-1986. Owens's memorable red, white and blue guitar became his visual performance trademark. \nOwens had throat cancer surgery in 1993 and was hospitalized with pneumonia in January 1997. \nBorn Alvis Edgar Owens on August 12, 1929 outside Sherman, Texas, he was the son of a sharecropper, and moved with his family to Arizona during the Great Depression at age 8, and by age 16 was playing music in taverns. \nHis first wife Bonnie sometimes performed with him, later becoming a lead back-up singer after their 1953 divorce.

The French government claims that this process is necessary to reduce the unemployment rates of young people, which is pegged as high as 23% (this rate is the quotient of the number of people under 26 deemed to seek employment over the total of those employed and deemed to seek employment, which excludes the large proportion of students in that population). However, student protestors and trade unions say that the legislation infringes on workers' rights, and opinion polls show that some two-thirds of the population want the CPE either modified or dropped altogether.\nThe CPE allows employers to hire people age 26 and younger on a contract for up to two years which may be terminated at any time without explanation. While supporters of the law say that it will make younger people more attractive for employers, opponents say it makes it harder for young people to find long-term employment as there is no incentive for employers to offer any other form of contract.\nLabour unions and student organisers are calling for a national strike on Tuesday, the fifth strike in the past two weeks.\nThe French labor laws are claimed to be among those protecting employees the most in Europe; they prevent employers from trimming their workforces without paying substantial severance packages. Prime Minister de Villepin's claims to intend to reduce youth unemployment by focusing on attracting modern industries relying on higher employee turnover and more flexible employment arrangements.\nThe current program is similar to the CNE ordinance the Prime Minister issued last summer for small businesses in France. \nCPE was adopted under an exceptional \"fast-track\" procedure allowing the executive to pass legislation through Parliament without Parliament having to approve it, known as \"49-3\" following from the number of the relevant article in the French Constitution. This procedure is normally reserved for important but controversial texts considered a crucial and urgent element of the policies of the Prime Minister. Once 49-3 is declared, the law is considered adopted by Parliament unless the National Assembly votes a motion of censure, which terminates the Prime Minister and his cabinet's term. Following standard practice when 49-3 is used, a motion of censure was proposed by the opposition, then voted down by the Assembly (in which the ruling UMP party has a majority)."}

It is to be placed on the corner of Elmwood and Forest Avenues in Buffalo and will require the demolition of at least five properties (1109-1121 Elmwood).\nThe proposal also required that all five properties, including 605 Forest, be rezoned to a \"C-2\" zone, or a \"special development plan.\" The rezoning was passed by Buffalo's Common Council on March 21, 2006.\nRussell Smith, owner of the Six Nation's Gift Shop at 1121 Elmwood, also participated in the protest.\n\"I am a Native American and we opened a Native American gift shop and we are just brand new [and just] opened.

We haven't [had] any idea that they [Savarino] were even planning to tear these buildings down to put a hotel here until we had moved in. I think thats a little unfair.\"\nFormer City of Buffalo Mayor Anthony Masiello was asked to sign the petition to stop the hotel when he walked by, but he declined saying, \"I respect what you are doing, but I am for the hotel.\"\nDespite the cold weather, at least 45 people showed up to walk the picket line.\nFor the moment, no further protests have been scheduled, pending the final decision on the hotel proposal by the city's Planning Board which meets Tuesday, March 28, 2006.

Pollina reports that she is looking into a \"legal fund.\"\nSome of the affected are considering going to the New York State Supreme Court pro se to seek an injunction. \nSome tenants of Mobius's buildings have accused him of being a \"slumlord\" and claim that he \"intentionally neglected\" his properties with the intention of selling. Mobius, who has owned the properties for about 20 years, tried in 1995 to sell them to a developer who wanted to build a Walgreens Drugstore on the same site as the proposed hotel.\nMobius is expected to appear in housing Court on April 11, 2006.

He turned his shotgun on himself when apprehended by a police officer on the porch of the house where the shootings took place.

Before returning to the party, Huff spray-painted the word, \"now,\" on the sidewalk, and on the steps approaching the house. Seattle police officer Steve Leonard heard the shots, and arrived on the scene to find Huff emerging from the house. Huff was warned to drop his weapon, at which point he aimed his shotgun at his own head and fired.\nThree of the victims were killed in the living room, and another two were found dead on the porch and steps of the house. Another died at the hospital. One of the hospitalized victims was initially reported in critical condition, but was upgraded Monday morning to satisfactory condition.\nHuff, originally from Whitefish, Montana, had been charged in 2000 with felony criminal mischief for firing on a sculpture with a shotgun, according to Flathead County, Montana Sherriff Jim Dupont. Police found an assault rifle, a machete and ammunition in Huff's truck, and a search of his North Seattle apartment turned up three more rifles."}

The legislation was passed in a row of controversy by parliament in December last year.\nThe contentious WorkChoices measures aim to move workers onto a federal industrial relations system and increase to the use of individual workplace contracts - under which conditions such as overtime and penalty rates can be set. The new WorkChoices arrangements include scrapping of unfair dismissal rights; the control by Federal government over state-based IR systems; more encouragement of individual contracts; award-cutting of award rates; secret ballots for industrial action and removal of the no-disadvantage test in new contracts.\nThe union movement has launched a fresh campaign to protest this week's changes. ACTU secretary Greg Combet warns that some employees will feel the effects as soon as they come into force, because they will no longer be protected by the previous unfair dismissal laws. He says with the changes becoming enforced this week, the Federal opposition party must now concentrate on industrial relations and not on \"political infighting\". \nAustralia's Prime Minister, John Howard, says he's prepared for a union scare-mongering over the IR laws, but assumes the campaign will fail. \"I predict the scare campaign will go on,\" he said. \"I also predict that the scare campaign will fail.\" Mr Howard says workers should wait and experience the new system for themselves and that the changes will give workers greater flexibility. \"Over time it will be beneficial,\" he said.\nCombet feels different about the effects. \"It's likely, somewhere around Australia tomorrow, someone is going to be sacked unfairly and they'll be the first victim of the new laws,\" he told the ABC. \"The really significant thing is that the balance of power in the workplace is shifting sharply to the business community, to the employer.\"\nFederal Workplace Relations Minister Kevin Andrews told reporters last week that \"the sky would not fall, because people would go to work next Monday and not detect any difference.\" He described union protests as \"hysterical outbursts\". \"There is nothing in this legislation that people need to worry about in the ordinary course,\" he said.\nDespite the Howard government's increased majority in the Senate, the passing of bill has not been smooth. In November last year, hundreds of thousands of demonstrators rallied across the nation to express dissent of the IR legislation. Ex-Finance Minister, Senator Nick Minchin, said most Australians \"violently disagree\" with the recent IR changes and there was a real prospect that the High Court could overturn the Work Choices laws.\nThe HR Nicholls Society, described as one of Australia's most politically conservative organisations, has likened the new federal laws to the former Soviet system of \"command and control.\" Society president Ray Evans says he does not like the centralised power being handed to the government under the changes, nor its encroachment on states' rights. \nEvans says the myriad of complex new laws would create a system where \"so-called IR professionals would stand to make a lot of money sorting through it... every economic decision has to go back to some central authority and get ticked off,\" he said . \"There is a lot of that sort of attitude in this legislation and I think it is very unfortunate.\"\nKemalex Plastics owner Richard Colebatch of the HR Nicholls Society said the changes are \"very complicated for anybody to decipher... The professionals will spend a lot of money, the employers' money, working their way through the mire trying to create the new rules people are going to work towards.\"\nBut the Prime Minister says \"more jobs will be generated in the small business sector as a result of the removal of the absurd job-destroying unfair dismissal laws, and the greater flexibility for people to make workplace agreements at the enterprise level will lift productivity,\" he told reporters in Melbourne. \"Sure some people will complain, but a lot of people will benefit through getting job opportunities. Young people, who will get an opportunity to put their step on the bottom rung of the ladder for the first time, will benefit enormously.\"\nThe Australian Medical Association (AMA) said WorkChoices regulations do not go far enough in clarifying who can legally issue medical certificates for sick leave. AMA vice-president Dr Choong-Siew Yong said WorkChoices regulations meant employers and employees faced uncertainty and confusion over sick leave. \n\"The regulations fail to acknowledge two very serious failings,\" Dr Yong said in a statement. \"One, if people are seriously ill, they should be seeing their medical doctor. Two, opening up medical certification to a whole range of non-medical practitioners will make it difficult for employers to take sick leave seriously.\" "}

The test was carried out in a dark hangar and the plane's aisles were littered with debris to simulate actual emergency conditions.\nThe A380 will be the world's largest passenger airliner, almost twice as large as the current largest airliner, the Boeing 747. Airbus has had 159 planes on order by 16 customers, and the first A380s will go to Singapore Airlines towards the end of the year.\nThis test was important to Airbus, as in August 2005 an Airbus A340 overshot the runway and 300 people escaped before the plane burst into flames. Infrared camera recordings of the test will be analyzed by authorities such as the European Aviation Safety Agency, while the US Federal Aviation Administration was present during the test. The European Aviation Safety Agency will confirm the test results this week; Airbus intends to repeat the test on Saturday if the aviation agency fails this attempt. \nThe volunteers, who were paid 60 euros (about US$72) and a meal, were from Airbus staff, sports clubs, and dancing clubs in the Hamburg area where the test took place. Airbus recruited people from clubs in order to get volunteers in good physical shape.\nTwo days later, the American and European aviation authorities (the FAA and EASA, respectively) officially certified the A380 to carry 853 passengers. This certification demonstrated that the test procedures use by Airbus met their respective standards. "}

It also claims that 100% testing does not ensure food safety because the disease is difficult to detect in younger animals.\nThe USDA currently tests about 1% of cattle slaughtered in the U.S. The USDA's objection is believed to be the result of pressure from larger meatpacking operations. In 2004, the president of the National Cattlemen's Beef Association told the Washington Post that \"If testing is allowed at Creekstone, we think it would become the international standard and the domestic standard, too.\" Creekstone Farms says tests cost about $20 per animal, increasing the cost of beef by about 10 cents per pound.

The media buzz is that Parker has taken up to a new level... the air.\nDuring a Women's NCAA Championship game against the Army Black Knights, Parker made her first dunk of the game with 13:44 left in the first half. The Lady Vols were ahead, 14-13, as Sidney Spencer fed the ball to Parker, who flew over opponents to the net, becoming the first woman to slam dunk in an NCAA game. The crowd roared... not once, but twice. With 14:18 left in the second half, Parker took Nicky Anosike's pass and soared above Army and Lady Vol players. Parker palmed the ball and stuffed it through the rim for her second slam dunk in the game. Even the famously focused Coach Pat Summit took a moment to appreciate the feat. \nDuring an NPR interview, sports analyst, Nancy Lieberman, spoke about what Parker's dunking foreshadows for women's basketball. Both Lieberman and Summit noted that Parker frequently dunks the ball during practice, as other women do. Lieberman says that women's basketball has developed immensely in recent years. And she expects audiences will see women NCAA and professional basketball players use dunking and other spectacular skills much more in the future.\nMost people are celebrating Parker's double dunk as a success. In both women's and men's basketball, a few have questioned whether dunking makes the game better. But, adding a dunk shot will certainly change the game, as will the continued development of point guards. Basketball analysts usually agree that dunking is exciting and most say that using this high-percentage shot will draw bigger audiences to women's hoops. "}

After introductory speeches by both the Prime Minister of Australia John Howard and the Leader of the Opposition Kim Beazley, Blair spoke on globalisation and trade, security, terrorism, and the war in Iraq and Afghanistan. He also touched on the Middle East and climate change. \nMr Blair started by reminiscing about his childhood, when he lived from the age of two until five in Adelaide, South Australia. \"I remember returning from the hospital where my sister Sarah had just been born, looking at her in the back of the old Austin that we drove; running errands for our neighbour, Mr Trederay; taking showers under the garden hose in the heat on the lawn; visiting friends up-country in the Adelaide Hills; and being chased by magpies as I ran across the open ground near our home.\"\nGlobalisation, trade, and development.\nHe talked about the inevitability of Globalisation, but warned that it should be tempered by social justice. \"Globalisation is a fact, but the values that govern it are a choice. We know the values we believe in: democracy and the rule of law, but also justice, the simple conviction that, given a fair go, human beings can better themselves and the world around them.\" He later linked security with justice, saying \"there is no prosperity without security and no security without justice. That is the consequence of an interconnected world.\"\nHe described the two perspectives on trade as \"open or closed\", meaning those who support free trade and reduction of tarrifs, and those who are more protectionist. Mr Blair was firmly in the \"open\" camp, but he warned that poverty must also be tackled. \"Everywhere you look today, the tide of protectionist sentiment is flowing. In this World Trade Round we have the opportunity to make it ebb. At stake, obviously, is our commitment on world poverty and development.\" According to Blair, rich western nations have a long way to go before their markets can be considered open. \"Europe\u2019s agricultural protection is a policy born of another age and it is time to end it. But change in Europe alone is not the answer. America must open up; Japan, too.\"\nHe also linked trade to development, saying that the connection was a matter \"of justice, because the poorest nations need to be able to stand on their own two feet and trade in our markets.\"\nTerrorism, Iraq, Afghanistan.\nHe warned of the immediate threat of \"Islamist extremism\", but argued that terrorism did not begin with the September 11 attacks in the United States, but rather had a much longer history. \"It simply came to our notice then. Its victims are to be found in the recent history of many lands, from Russia and India but also Algeria, Pakistan, Libya, Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Indonesia, Kenya and countless more.\"\nHe acknowledged that the decision to invade Iraq was as divisive in Britain as in Australia, but sought to justify military action, saying \"for almost three years now we have been in Iraq with full United Nations support. From the outset our forces in Afghanistan have been there with UN authority. In both cases, there is the full support of democratically elected governments.\" He also spoke of the gains made by both Iraq and Afghanistan. \"In each case, the people have, for the first time, been offered a chance to vote. In each case, they have seized it, despite obstacles we can scarcely imagine.\"\nHe spoke in support of the US Alliance, but said that maintaining some independence was important. \"I do not always agree with the United States. Sometimes they can be difficult friends to have.\"\nIsrael and Palestine.\nMr Blair called on the United States to work for security in the Middle East, and especially for a two state solution. \"once the Israeli election has taken place, we must redouble our efforts to find a way to the only solution that works\u2014a secure state of Israel and a viable, independent Palestinian state.\"\nClimate change.\nMr Blair emphasised the need to focus on climate change, and said that it was even more important now with the crisis over oil prices. He noted the differences between the Australian and British approaches to climate change, and argued that co-operation was needed. \"At some point we must bring it all together. There will be no agreement worth having that does not involve the United States, China and India, as well as the rest of us.\""}

The 77-year-old had been ill with motor neurone disease. Family members described his passing as peaceful. Hart is a household name in Australia.\nHart's son, John Hart, says a State funeral is being organised for his father. He says his father lost the ability to paint about six months ago. Pro Hart's son David today said the funeral for the \"brushman of the bush\" will be held in the far-western New South Wales mining city of Broken Hill next Tuesday. \"It will be held next Tuesday\", he said, \"probably in the town's civic centre.\"\nBorn Kevin Charles Hart in Broken Hill on May 30, 1928, his mining mates nicknamed him 'Professor' due to his passion for invention. He started painting \"cheeky\" pictures on the wooden beams of the mines he worked in. Hart went to few art classes and started painting full-time in 1958.\nSince then, he has exhibited all over the world, including London, New York, Paris and Tokyo. He also illustrated several books. Hart's preoccupation with art began as a teenager on his family's sheep station near Menindee. \nHis work hangs in collections all over the world. Agent Amanda Phillips says Hart was one of Australia's most renowned artists yet his paintings are not in the National Gallery of Australia. \"He's a great Australian, I mean he's been given an MBE for his services to art, he's been honoured all around the world, his work hangs in major collections around the world, why isn't he displayed here in Australia? A spokeswoman for the National Gallery confirmed they had a \"very limited collection\" of Pro Hart's works although no paintings.\nCannon Technique.\nHart is renowned for his unique 'cannon' technique, which he developed in 1970. 'Cannon' painting works by filling balls with paint and firing them at the canvas using a hand-held cannon.\n\"If you don't fit in their groove, they don't want to know you,\" Hart once said of the Australian art community. Hart gained his widest recognition in Australia when he featured in a television carpet advertisement, painting a carpet with spaghetti, milk, wine and other foods. \"Oh Mr Hart, what a mess!\" was the catchcry. \nThe Federal Member for Parkes, John Cobb, said Hart had been an inspirational figure in Broken Hill and helped to establish the town as one of the Australia's greatest artistic centres. \nPrime Minister John Howard described Hart as a great artist whose portraits of the outback were instantly recognisable. \"Not only will he be remembered as one of our finest painters but also for the mark he made in sculpture and through his book illustrations,\" Howard said in a statement.\n\"He made a wonderful contribution to art and culture in Australia, enhancing its profile on the world stage.\" \nHe said Hart's artistic legacy was assured. \"I think they'll remember the colour, they'll remember the unconventional methods and they'll remember the identification with a city which is part of the history of this country; a very special part.\"\nFellow artist Ken Done said Hart's legacy was \"in his paintings\". He said the painter was best known for his portraits of the outback. \"But I think his strongest pictures were the ones he did about his time underground \u2013 those tougher times, tougher men \u2013 and he brought a real sensitivity to that experience,\" Done said. \nHart received the Member of the Order of the British Empire award in 1976 for his services to art in Australia. He is survived by his wife Raylee, three sons and two daughters."}

The members of 11 different trades unions were involved in the 24hr strike. As the day began they declared that support for the strike was solid. Although the strikers work for local councils, their pay and conditions are agreed nationally. The Local Government Association which represents the local councils in England and Wales declared predictions that 1.5 million people would stay away from work as \"wildly optimistic\".\nThe Unions' complaint is that local government workers are being treated unfavourably compared to other public sector employees. They say that agreements on pensions that have been reached with civil servants, teachers and health workers will allow those staff to continue to retire at 60 while local government staff will be forced to work until they are 65. Civil servants work for national government, teachers work for local councils but have their own pension arrangements and most health workers are employed by the state-controlled National Health Service.\nThe Local Government Association claims that if council workers continue to be able to retire at 60, it will increase the levels of Council Tax (a tax on people living in properties which funds a proportion of local government expenditure) by 2%.\nThe striking workers provide a wide range of services from assisting teachers in the class room, through inspecting kitchens for hygiene to provising care to the vulnerable in society. In some places council workers collect tolls for road tunnels or manage ferries. Mainstream media have reported on the strike all day with heavy coverage of disruption to commuters where transport has been affected. The unions have emphasised the large number of their members who are women working in low paid jobs.\nThe Government which regulates the scheme claimed that the early retirement provisions (called the rule of 85) were age-discriminatory and had to be removed.\nThe strike ended at midnight. The Unions have not declared any further strike days.\nThe Unions involved were AEP, AMICUS, CYWU, GMB, NAPO, NIPSA, NUJ, NUT, TGWU, UCATT and UNISON."}

King and David I. Cleland, was published in 1979. \nBrookings Institution researchers Clifford Gaddy and Igor Danchenko claim that Putin's dissertation, which earned him a candidate's degree in economics from the St. Petersburg Mining Institute, copies almost verbatim from the text. \nGaddy states, \"I'm convinced that Putin did read that textbook. This is exactly the style of governing the country that he has used in Russia. He's actually taking their ideas and treating Russia as if it's a corporation -- 'Russia Incorporated.'\" \nMany Russian government officials at the time would pay a ghostwriter for such publications, as gaining a degree could add legitimacy to one's governing policy. In that sense, it is possible Putin bought or paid for the dissertation and did not read over - in essence, passing plagiarised work off as his own, but not himself committing plagiarism. Gaddy states: \"It's very clear he never wrote the thing in the first case, this is a clear diploma-mill-type operation. This is a dissertation, paid for, made-to-order.\"\nAlthough Gaddy and Danchenko set out searching for Putin's views on economics and sustainable development, they noticed in reading his dissertation that certain sections seemed out of place. The only English language source in the text was King and Cleland's book. In the translation from Russia to English of the dissertation, text was discovered that came from that book without credit. \nKing and Cleland have no plans to sue. \nSources.\nVladimir Putin's Dissertation reference at the Russian State Library:\nhttp://sigla.rsl.ru/view.jsp?o=a&amp;f=1016&amp;t=3&amp;v0=%D0%9F%D1%83%D1%82%D0%B8%D0%BD&amp;o=a&amp;f=1003&amp;t=1&amp;v1=&amp;o=a&amp;f=4&amp;t=2&amp;v2=&amp;o=a&amp;f=21&amp;t=3&amp;v3=&amp;o=a&amp;f=1016&amp;t=3&amp;v4=&amp;o=a&amp;f=1016&amp;t=3&amp;v5=&amp;tr=Cyr-Common&amp;cc=n&amp;i=3&amp;s=2&amp;i18n=en&amp;ce=...U"}

Apple Corps claims that Apple Computer's iTunes Music Store violates an agreement reached between the two companies in 1991, which barred Apple Computer from using the \"Apple\" brand in certain uses in the music business.\nThe trial is set to begin on Wednesday in the Royal Courts of Justice, located in central London. Presiding Judge Martin Mann has stated that he owns an iPod portable music player, which is made by Apple Computer and marketed alongside the iTunes Music Store.\nApple Corps has twice before sued Apple Computer over its use of the \"Apple\" name. The first lawsuit was settled out of court in 1981, with the young computer maker paying $80,000 and agreeing to stay out of the music business.\nIn the late 1980's Apple Computer added audio recording abilities to its Macintosh computers, prompting Apple Corps to file suit again in 1989. That lawsuit was settled in 1991, also out of court, with Apple paying $26.5 million. The settlement included a more specific agreement over the boundaries between the two brands: Apple Computer was allowed to use its name to market \"goods or services...used to reproduce, run, play or otherwise deliver such [music] content,\" but barred from distributing music on a physical medium such as CD or cassette.\nApple Corps' latest suit, filed in September 2003, claims that the computer company violated the 1991 agreement with its iTunes Music Store, which sells digital music that can be downloaded to personal computers. A statement from Apple Computer stated that \"Apple and Apple Corps now have differing interpretations of this agreement and will need to ask a court to resolve this dispute.\" Some observers have suggested that the wording of the 1991 agreement, which did not explicitly bar digital music distribution, could be to Apple Computer's advantage.\nA similar suit was filed simultaneously in California, Apple Computer's home state, but on September 21, 2004 the parties agreed to have the case heard by the UK court.\nBeatles songs have not been licensed for digital download on any of the online music services.\nApple Corps was founded by the Beatles in 1968. Apple Computer was started by Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak in 1976, and launched the iTunes Music Store in 2003."}

{"id": "37420", "revid": "9158", "url": "https://en.wikinews.org/wiki?curid=37420", "title": "President Bush to limit congressional oversight in PATRIOT amendment act", "text": "President Bush signed the \"USA PATRIOT Act Additional Reauthorizing Amendments Act of 2006\" into law. In the signing statement, Bush averred that he could withhold information about the administration's controversial use of Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act powers and National Security Letters if he deemed that they impaired foreign relations, national security, the deliberative processes of the Executive, or the performance of the Executive's constitutional duties. Lawmakers and Legal experts have questioned the president's authority to contravene the Congress's intent in such a way. \nThe Patriot Act reauthorisation bill specifically mandates the Inspector General of the Department of Justice to audit the administration's use of investigative authority granted by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act and National Security Letters and requires these audits to be submitted for congressional review. \nIn the signing statement, President Bush wrote \"The executive branch shall construe the provisions of H.R. 3199 that call for furnishing information to entities outside the executive branch, such as sections 106A and 119, in a manner consistent with the President's constitutional authority to supervise the unitary executive branch and to withhold information the disclosure of which could impair foreign relations, national security, the deliberative processes of the Executive, or the performance of the Executive's constitutional duties.\"\nThis follows on the heels of the signing of the congressional ban on torture issued in January of this year, when the President declared that he would view the interrogation limits in the context of his broader powers to protect national security. A senior white house official told a Boston Globe reporter that \"Of course the president has the obligation to follow this law, [but] he also has the obligation to defend and protect the country as the commander in chief, and he will have to square those two responsibilities in each case.\" The official added \"We are not expecting that those two responsibilities will come into conflict, but it's possible that they will.\"\nLawmakers tried to get a handle on President Bush's use of signing statements in 2003, by passing a Justice Department spending bill that required the department to inform Congress whenever the administration decided to ignore a legislative provision on constitutional grounds.\nBush signed the bill, but issued a statement asserting his right to ignore the notification requirement. \nResponses.\nSen. Lindsey Graham, (R-S.C.) voiced concern over the way national security is being used as a catch all phrase in this and a number of other signing statements, saying \"If you take this to its logical conclusion, because during war the commander in chief has an obligation to protect us, any statute on the books could be summarily waived,\"\nDavid Golove, a New York University law professor who specializes in executive power issues, said \"On the one hand, they deny that Congress even has the authority to pass laws on these subjects like torture and eavesdropping, and in addition to that, they say that Congress is not even entitled to get information about anything to do with the war on terrorism.\"\nSen Arlen Specter, (R-Pa) chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee argued \"He (Bush) can say whatever he likes, I don't know if that has a whole lot of impact on the statute. Statutes are traditionally a matter of congressional intent,\" \nSen Patrick J. Leahy, (D-Ver) said in a prepared statement: \"The president's signing statements are not the law, and Congress should not allow them to be the last word, The president's constitutional duty is to faithfully execute the laws as written by the Congress, not cherry-pick the laws he decides he wants to follow. It is our duty to ensure, by means of congressional oversight, that he does so.\nSigning Statements.\nThe signing statement is a written proclamation, issued by the president of the United Sates that accompany the signing of a law passed by the legislative branch and generally sets forth how the executive branch intends to interpret and enforce the new law. \nThe use of signing statements started with the US's fifth President James Monroe (1817-1825) and from that time was used sparingly. In fact from Monroe to Jimmy Carter (39 th President 1977-1981) there were a total of a 109 signing statements issued, 75 of which were to protect presidential prerogatives and 34 were to instruct the executive branch agencies on the interpretation of sections of the law. Whereas from the Reagan administration through the Clinton administration there were a total of 396 signing statements made with 322 to protect presidential prerogative and 74 to instruct on presidential interpretation of the law. Following along this sharp increase the Bush administration issued 435 statements almost entirely objecting to encroachments upon presidential prerogatives. \nThe key argument involved here is in the interpretation of the constitution. The Bush administration is acting from on an idea called the Unitary Executive theory - you may have noticed it is mentioned twice in his signing statement - this theory holds that all three branches of the federal government have the power and duty to interpret the Constitution and that the meaning of the Constitution is determined through the dynamic interaction of all three branches.\nThis idea gained strength during the Reagan administration as a response to the presidency having been severely weakened by Vietnam and, Watergate and is mainly championed by the \"Federalist Society,\" a group of conservative lawyers who nearly all worked in the Nixon, Ford, and Reagan white houses. It largely claims its authority from two sources within the Constitution\u2014the \"Oath\" and \"Take Care\" clauses of Article II. The \"Oath\" requirement acts as a sort of shield, protecting the president from enforcing things he independently determines are unconstitutional, and the \"Oath\" clause directs the president to \"faithfully execute the Office of the President and [to] preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States.\" \nActing on this theory, then deputy assistant attorney general in the Office of Legal Counsel Samuel Alito wrote a draft memo on Feb. 5, 1986 outlining a strategy for strengthening presidential authority. It laid out a case for having the president routinely issue statements about the meaning of statutes when he signs them into law. He explained his thoughts this way:\n\"Since the president's approval is just as important as that of the House or Senate, it seems to follow that the president's understanding of the bill should be just as important as that of Congress,\" He later added that \"by forcing some rethinking by courts, scholars, and litigants, it may help to curb some of the prevalent abuses of legislative history.\" \nPhillip Cooper, a professor of public administration at Portland State University states his objection to this; \"It's nothing short of breath-taking. In every case, the White House has interpreted presidential authority as broadly as possible, interpreted legislative authority as narrowly as possible, and preempted the judiciary. \nThe office of legal consul under President Clinton declared: \"If the President may properly decline to enforce a law, at least when it unconstitutionally encroaches on his powers, then it arguably follows that he may properly announce to Congress and to the public that he will not enforce a provision of an enactment he is signing. If so, then a signing statement that challenges what the President determines to be an unconstitutional encroachment on his power, or that announces the President's unwillingness to enforce (or willingness to litigate) such a provision, can be a valid and reasonable exercise of Presidential authority.\""}

After the takeover bid, the Luxembourg Chamber of Commerce attempted to introduce new rules that would stop companies with less than 25% of their shares in free float from making a cash and bid offer for a company whose location is in Luxembourg. India news reports then claimed that this was a discriminatory action because Laskshmi Mittal is an Indian.\nLuxembourg officials have disputed this, stating that their actions were only due to the need to comply with EU legislation. The country's minister for economy and foreign trade, Leannot Krecke, stated, \"The government will have no role in impeding the bid. We intend to bring the takeover bill in May to put in the best international practices in our economy.\" Krecke also stated that a similar bill will have to be brought to the national governments of each of the 25 EU member nations so that they complied with EU legislation. \nWord of New Delhi's displeasure with Luxembourg's stance seems to have been translated to Luxembourg during a meeting that the finance ministers of both countries had in India. \nMeanwhile, Mittal has announced that it is prepared to cut the cash portion of its buyout offer. Mittal will do so if Arcelor increases its dividend to shareholders above the 80 cent market consensus. A spokesman for Mittal stated: \"If Arcelor decides to distribute extra cash to shareholders, we will consider that as an advance payment on our offer and adjust the cash component of our offer accordingly.\""}

People want the truth. They want the truth. And what's been offered to us resembles nothing of the sort.\"\nIn recounting his reaction on the day of the event, Sheen said,\"I \"was up early and we were gonna do a pre-shoot on Spin City, the show I used to do. I was watching the news and the north tower was burning. There was a feeling, it just didn't look like any commercial jetliner I've flown on any time in my life and then when the buildings came down later on that day I said to my brother, 'Call me insane but did it sorta look like those buildings came down in a controlled demolition?'\" \nWriter Marc Jacobson, of the \"New York\" magazine, who co-appeared with Sheen on the same program said in response: \"Well, I think he's doing a reasonable rendition of what other people that believe in this stuff say. And when he says he has his facts straight, I mean, I think the facts are in question. I mean, I think, just because you know what it says on all of these different Web sites doesn't mean that that's necessarily the fact. That's the reason why the United States government, with their endless amounts of resources, let us down by not doing the proper work on the 9/11 Commission. That's a real problem. Well, you know, but, I mean, it's just one of those kind of things where you do this work and nobody really cares, but then Charlie Sheen is interested, so then everybody is interested, and that's fine. You know, obviously, this material needs to be looked at again, because there's been a lot of problems with the 9/11 Commission report. People feel it's not adequate. Most of the people who had lost people during that time feel it's not adequate. And it's just I think we're living in a truth vacuum, in a sense, that any time there's a truth vacuum, these ideas -- because people are smart. They put two and two together. Sometimes they get five; sometimes they get 12, but sometimes they get 11, like 9/11, but sometimes they get four. And the thing is that, if you have a situation where the so-called facts are covered up and aggressively covered up, then you're going to get these conspiracy theories.\" One website is claiming that Google had been censoring out any news articles relating to Sheen and 9/11 from it's search engine.\nRegarding the plane that hit the Pentagon, Sheen also has questions: \"Just show us how this particular plane pulled off these maneuvers\u2026 It is up to us to reveal the truth. It is up to us because we owe it to the families, we owe it to the victims, we owe it to everyone's life who was drastically altered, horrifically, that day and forever. We owe it to them to uncover what happened.\"\" \nSome supporters of Sheen's theories have complained about the lack of mainstream media coverage. They point to CNN's recent cancellation of Ed Asner's interview on Showbiz Tonight, where he was expected to support Sheen's position, as an example of the \"media blackout\". \nMarina Hyde of \"The Guardian\" proposed a theory of her own with regard to Sheen: \"Frankly, with dentistry as expensive as yours, you simply can't afford to let The Man stamp his jackboot down on your face, and so it is that when faced with the inquiry 'did Lee Harvey Oswald act alone?', you find yourself thinking: 'God, I mean\u2026 do any of us? Like, he had to have people, you know? At least an agent and a publicist.'\""}

Her lawyer, Larry Otter, argued that Patrick Murphy should be thrown off the ballot for the Democratic primary election in the eighth congressional district of Pennsylvania. The eighth district is primarily located in Bucks County, Pennsylvania.\nOtter argued that during the period of election petition signature collection, Murphy had signed his name as the circulator on two petition sheets, but was not present for each signature that was signed on those sheets, and thereby breaking Pennsylvania state law. Pennsylvania law states that whoever signs a petition sheet as a circulator must be present for each signature and see each signature placed on the sheet.\nMurphy admitted that he was not at the sheet for every signature, and he agreed that the 96 signatures on those two sheets should be invalidated. He also stated that he was unaware of that particular election statute. Otter argued that the candidacy should be thrown out because when Murphy presented his signatures he was required to sign an affidavit stating he would \"not knowingly violate any election law.\" It was Otter's contention to Judge Robert Simpson, Jr., that it is unbelievable that Murphy would not know the law, as Murphy is a lawyer.\n\"Mr. Murphy is a member of the bar of this court. He can't say he doesn't know what the law was. He's been campaigning over a year,\" Otter said. He then continued, arguing that since Murphy knowingly falsified his name on those two circulation petitions, he also failed to fulfill his candidate affidavit, which according to state law is a criminal offense. \nThe campaign manager for the Murphy campaign, Josh Nanberg, said, \"Under Otter's argument, any candidate who has a meeting and puts a clipboard at the front table and ... goes to the bathroom should be thrown out. That's ridiculous.\""}

If anyone [is] interested in its development, he/she can subscribe to the pacman development mailing list.\nWikinews: I've successfully installed Frugalware, OpenSUSE, and WinXP on the same box. Do you see a lot of people doing this sort of thing in the future?\nMikl\u00f3s Vajna: We support having more than one operating system on a single machine \u2014 though this matters only in case Frugalware is the last installed operating system. We do not have any statistics about what operating systems do other people use besides Frugalware, if they have more than one.\nWikinews: Is it possible that PearPC and Frugalware may have a relationship to distribute the PearPC Emulator with Frugalware in the future?\nMikl\u00f3s Vajna: It is already available .\nWikinews: What kinds of software might you include with further editions of Frugalware? Is Muse part of the base package for electronic musicians, or will you have those sorts of things?\nMikl\u00f3s Vajna: No . It is not available at the moment. You can request a package by filing a feature request to our Bug Tracking System, at .\nWikinews: Is the autoupdating feature of Frugalware unique to Frugalware and perhaps a keystone to future developments?\nMikl\u00f3s Vajna: I have never tried other autoupdating features. What one can see is that upgrading even from the previous stable release \u2014 which means installing 6 months of update at once \u2014 requires only a few tricks, and these are documented. So it works as it should, and we always pay attention not to break this great feature.\nWikinews: What can new users of Frugalware do to test and relay infotmation back to the developers through the correct channels?\nMikl\u00f3s Vajna: We have released stable versions two times a year. There are testing releases every two months. If one would like to help us, then download these releases, test them, and if something is broken, then file a bug report to the BTS (mentioned above already).\nFrugalware has new X Windows video drivers that provide a major speed improvement over available patches for previous editions of Linux. Alex Smith has been working on them as a developer.\nIn addition, the PearPC emulator mentioned above, which comes with the package manager, may, with proper tuning and installation of a \"legal\" copy of Mac OSX, enable many Intel and AMD Frugalware users to use the Apple OS on their desktops. Alex Smith is also a contact person for the PearPC project, which can also be found in irc://irc.freenode.net and at http://www.pearpc.net.\nThe official release time of the latest edition frugalware-0.4 was Mar 30 07:42:21. The developers can be reached for comment through IRC at #frugalware in the irc.freenode.net network."}

The ginger-haired property tycoon's mother is from the Western Isles of Scotland. \nThe \u00a3300m project at Menie in Aberdeenshire will include both a links course and an inland course, and a 400-bedroom hotel as well as a golfing academy and holiday homes. The facilities are being built with the intention of attracting the Open Championship to the site, officially dubbed \"Trump International Golf Links, Scotland\".\nFields and sand-dunes make up the landscape of the coastal site. Trump said of the location, \"As soon as I saw it there was no question about it. I looked at 211 fantastic sites all over Europe, but here it is - the dune size and the ocean front. There is no piece of land that I have ever seen that is comparable to this.\" The billionaire claims that the complex, set to be his only development outside the United States, will be the \"best course in the world.\"\nLocal and national political figures, including Scottish First Minister Jack McConnell, have welcomed the announcement with open arms, as the project is expected to bring in an additional \u00a3157m to the region's economy within the first ten years. Scottish tourism company VisitScotland is also optimistic, expecting an influx of international visitors to play on (or simply visit) the site. Plans to expand the A90 road running past the site in the near future will enable more road traffic to and around the area. An \u00a360m expansion of Aberdeen Airport will also allow for vastly increased international air links, akin to those operated using Boeing 767 aircraft.\nWork on the golf complex itself is set to begin in September this year, with the Trump Organisation hopeful for a Spring 2008 opening date."}

Multiple threads allow each core to work on a number of tasks concurrently on a single core. This is particularly useful in a server environment where the UltraSPAC T1 was designed to be used.\nSun call the open source version of their processor the OpenSPARC T1 and have made the source code (in Verilog format) and specifications available on the OpenSPARC T1 website under the General Public License, the same license under which most distributions of Linux are released.\nIndustry observers say that the move is triggered by the SPARC architecture's shrinking market share to the likes of IBM's POWER architecture and x86 based chips from Intel and AMD.\nOpen Source Hardware has been gaining momentum since 2002, when Kofi Annan issued a challenge to technology companies. Despite Sun's OpenSPARC T1 not being the first open source processor in the world, it is the first time that the design for a proprietary design processor has been released to the open source community."}

With only one of the parties with seats contesting the election it is seen more as an attempt by current caretaker Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra to shore up his position in the face of mass protests and accusations of malfeasance.\nThe snap election was called on February 24 by the beleaguered PM, approximately one year after the previous election where his Thai Rak Thai party took 377 of the 500 seats in the lower house making it the first party to have been able to form a government without entering into a coalition.\nWith the main opposition parties, Democat Party (\"Pak Prachatipat\"), Great People's Party (\"Phak Mahachon\"), and Thai Nation Party (\"Phak Chaat Thai\") boycotting the election the results may not carry the legitimacy that Thaksin is seeking. Along with the People's Alliance for Democracy (PAD), the main opposition parties have called upon voters to mark their ballot as an abstention. With over 150 Changwats (constituencies) having a single Thai Rak Thai candidate on the ballot, some may not reach the required 20% of the eligble votes to be returned. This would leave the parliament short of its 500 seat requirement and unable to reconvene and ratify the appointment of a Prime Minister.\nAllegations of corruption centre on the Prime Minister's family's involvement in the sale of Shin Corp. to Temasek Holdings, described by Wikipedia as the investment arm of the Singapore government. On January 23, the PM's family sold their 49.6% share in the company tax-free for US$1.88 billion. Whilst protests and allegations had been made prior to the sale, it was a catalyst that provoked mass rallies in Bangkok demanding the PM's resignation.\nWith polls opening at 8 a.m. local time (0100 UTC), the BBC reports that voting has been steady and that the PM and his children voted a couple of hours after the polls opened. Some have used the poll as an opportunity to protest, with one university lecturer arrested for completing his ballot paper in blood.\nPolling closed at 3 p.m. local time (0800 UTC) with unofficial results expected later in the day."}

Somewhat surprisingly, the MoD failed to comment on this point, merely stressing the false nature of the claims regarding the meeting supposedly set for tomorrow (Monday, April 3).\nRegarding his country's nuclear program, Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad is maintaining his defiant stance, alluding to the fact that Article IV of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), which was reaffirmed by the United Nations Security Council in its March 29, 2006 presidential statement, implies that Iran has as much right to press on with such technologies as any other nation which is party to the NPT.\nSources.\n "}

The attack was not reported in the mainstream national media until this week, when it became known that the victim was the great-granddaughter of famous indigenous artist Albert Namatjira.\nIn an article published in Saturdays Sydney Morning Herald, Russell Skelton said that the fact that she was an Aborigine, and the location of her bashing, contributed to her death. \"If Jenissa had been white, she might be alive today, though the scars of her brutal bashing and rape could never be erased. If she had been bashed and left for dead almost anywhere else, assistance would have been immediate and the outrage strident.\" He also said that if her connection to Namatjira had been known, Jenissa's death would have been a \"national scandal.\"\nAssault and rape.\nPolice believe that she was attacked by a number of youths her own age while walking home. She continued to walk home, but collapsed unconscious near the entrance to the college. Here, according to police, she was found by three teenage boys, who dragged her out of view and raped her.\nJenissa was still alive when found. Skelton considered it likely that people had seen her during the morning but done nothing. \"That means a number of residents of middle-class Grevillea Drive probably noticed. The white T-shirt and striped tracksuit pants were hard to miss,\" he said.\nShe was taken to Alice Springs Hospital, and then flown to Adelaide's Women and Children's Hospital.\nCharges.\nOn February 13 Northern Territory Police charged a 16 year-old male and a 15 year-old female with assaulting Jenissa Ryan. Three other males, aged 14, 15, and 16, have been charged with having unlawful sexual intercourse with Jenissa Ryan. Police expressed gratitude for the assistance they had received from members of the public.\nAftermath.\nFather Asaeli Raass said that both indigenous and non-indigenous people were in denial about the incident. \"Yes, it's a painful thing, but people are sweeping it under the carpet when they should be confronting the big issues Jenissa's death raises,\" he said. He also said that the initial wave of publicity \"never travelled outside Alice Springs.\"\nJenissa's mother, Carmel Ryan, said that her daughter wanted to be a painter, like her great-grandfather. \"She wanted to be like him, to make a creative contribution we would all be proud of. Tragically that can never be, but I feel nothing but sorrow for the parents of the children involved in this terrible event,\" she said."}

A requirement of this agreement is that the country wishing to purchase uranium must also be a signatory to the UN's .\nAlexander Downer stated that China needs the uranium for its nuclear energy program. He said \"Given China's high projected growth in electricity demand over the coming years, there are clear environmental benefits in diversifying from fossil fuels to low greenhouse-emission technologies such as nuclear power.\"\nChina is expected to build between 40 to 50 nuclear plants over the next 20 years.\nIan Macfarlane, Austalia's Resource Minister said that exports should begin within four years and that the agreement was only the beginning of the export process. He told ABC Radio \"The signing of this agreement is really only the start of the process,\nWe need to move forward, there needs to be commercial negotiations between companies in Australia that are producing uranium and companies in China that wish to purchase it\" he said.\nIt is believed that Australia, which holds 40 percent of the world's uranium, may need to increase production. At present, Australia produces 10,000 tonnes per year. It is expected that China will require 20,000 tonnes a year from Australia.\n\"Uranium will only be sold by contract to utilities, it cannot be used for military purposes, China will also be subject to international atomic energy safeguards and that means inspections,\" Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer has stated and continued \"Thirdly, there will be a system that will track Australian nuclear material.\"\nKevin Rudd, Australian Opposition's foreign affairs spokesman said that he supported the agreement. Labor's foreign affairs spokesman Kevin Rudd supports the deal.\n\"If we have with China effective bilateral safeguards arrangements then there should be no impediment,\" he said. \nProfessor Ian Lowe from the Australian Conservation Foundation said in response to the deal that \"This is no time to be increasing the amount of fissile material in the world.\"\n has commented \"Make no mistake \u2014 selling Australian uranium to China will make the world less safe.\""}

The agency's mandate and powers have been compared to that of the United States' FBI.\nThe \"Serious Organised Crime Agency (SOCA)\", has approximately 4,200 \"law enforcement officers\", some of whom are ex-spies, and will use their \u00a3400m annual budget to fight counterfeiting, fraud, drug and people-trafficking.\nThe agency was created out of the National Crime Squad, the National Criminal Intelligence Service and investigative staff from the Immigration Service. SOCA is chaired by ex-MI5 chief Sir Stephen Lander.\nNew Powers.\nSOCA will take advantage of new powers which have been brought in by the Blair government to help tackle serious and organised crime. The main four are:\nQueen's Evidence&lt;br&gt;\nProsecutors are now able to offer formal statutory deals, such as immunity or a reduced sentence, to those who testify against other accused criminals.\nFinancial reporting orders&lt;br&gt;\nCourts can compel criminals to supply their bank statements of up to 20 years past, to demonstrate that they have had no crime related earnings.\nDisclosure notices&lt;br&gt;\nCourts can limit the suspect's right to remain silent, by ordering prison terms or fines if the suspect refuses to testify or provide documents.\nLaw enforcement officers&lt;br&gt;\nSOCA officers are empowered to exercise multiple powers, that of the police, immigration and customs officials.\nBlair's Comments.\nWhen Prime Minister Tony Blair announced SOCA yesterday, he made several comments regarding the nature of organised crime today and the disorganised and underpowered police force expected to combat it. After announcing that SOCA would make life \"hell\" for what he dubs \"criminal Mr. Bigs\", he continued to outline what he believed to be the type of crime Britain was dealing with today.\n\"The level of sophistication, the level, frankly, of brutality with which many of these gangs operate today means that we have to do it differently. Organised crime is a chain, the bottom link of which is the consumer and the individual victim. Even an apparently invisible and victimless crime like defrauding a financial institution has ramifications for ordinary people. Organised crime, like most crimes, tends to make victims of the poor as least as much, if not more, than the wealthy. So there is an imperative to act.\"\nAfter declaring that he would introduce any necessary new powers to help the new agency achieve its goals, he said, \"There is absolutely nothing, in my view, that should come before the basic liberties of people in this country to be freed from the tyranny of this type of organised crime.\"\nSources.\n "}

Evidence of Moussaoui's knowledge of 9/11 attacks are based on Moussaoui's own testimony, and some al-Qaida members have said that \"he knew nothing\" and is \"boasting\" of it and that Ramzi Binalshibh is the actual '20th hijacker'. Aaron Zebley, one of the FBI's two chief case agents on the Moussaoui investigation, also testified that \"Moussaoui knew nothing about some key elements\" of the 9/11 plot.\nMoussaoui is the only person to face charges in connection with the 9/11 attacks. It was not expected that Moussaoui would testify on his own behalf during the trial, but he changed his mind and testified in the last week of March that he was supposed to fly a plane with the \"shoe bomber\" on 9/11. Moussaoui's lawyers said that his claim was absurd and that Moussaoui was intentionally trying to elicit an execution for martyrdom purposes.\nMoussaoui refused to stand and prayed silently as the verdict was read. \"You'll never get my blood, God curse you all,\" Moussaoui said after the jurors had left the courtroom.\nThe jury took four days to arrive at the verdict. \"By this verdict, the jury has found that death is a possible sentence in this case,\" a court spokesman said. On the key question before the jurors, they answered yes on whether at least one victim died on 9/11 as a direct result of Moussaoui's actions.\nIf the jury had voted against his eligibility for the death penalty, Moussaoui would have been sentenced to life in prison.\nThe jury began weighing Moussaoui's fate last Wednesday. During its deliberations, jurors asked only one question, seeking a definition of a \"weapon of mass destruction.\" One of the three convictions for which Moussaoui could be put to death is conspiracy to use weapons of mass destruction.\nThe jurors were told that a plane used as a missile (the tactic employed on 9/11) qualifies as a weapon of mass destruction.\nMoussaoui pleaded guilty April 2005 to conspiring with al-Qaida to hijack aircraft and other crimes. At the time, he denied being part of the 9/11 plot, saying he was being trained for a separate attack, but he changed his testimony when he took the stand and claimed he was supposed to have flown a hijacked jetliner into the White House that day.\nMoussaoui was in jail at the time of the attacks, but prosecutors argue federal agents would have been able to stop or at least minimize the attacks if he had revealed his al-Qaida membership and his terrorist plans when he was arrested and interrogated by federal agents.\nThe last people executed without killing anyone were Julius and Ethel Rosenberg fifty years ago.\nNext phase of the trial.\nNow that this first phase of the trial to decide possible penalties is established, the jury of nine men and three women will hear more testimony, expected last as long as 3-months, on whether the 37-year-old Frenchman will face life imprisonment or execution. \nTestimony will include the families of 9/11 victims who will describe the human toll of the al-Qaida operation, in which four passenger airliners were taken over and two were flown to New York City and crashed into the World Trade Center, a third airplane struck the Pentagon, and the last crashed in a field near Shanksville, Pennsylvania apparently, after passengers intervened.\nCourt-appointed defense lawyers, whom Moussaoui has tried to reject, will summon experts to suggest he is schizophrenic after a cruel childhood during which he faced racism in France over his Moroccan ancestry."}

Although legal experts disagree on this authority, Libby stated that it was a White House lawyer who so counseled him.\nThis information has come to light due to Fitzgerald's efforts to collect information regarding the \"outing\" of former CIA operative Valerie Plame. Fitzgerald has broad authority to conduct investigations, as the special prosecutor in the case. Although Libby's statements released yesterday may seem inflammatory, it is unknown what effect they will have on either Vice President Cheney or President Bush. "}

The site, which is a parody of Tom Cruise and his involvement with the Church of Scientology, became the centre of controversy when it was served with a number of cease and desist orders initiated by the Church. On March 19, 2006, Glen issued a media release stating that his web hosting provider, YouTube, had removed videos of Tom Cruise which formed part of the site. The release suggested that YouTube had taken this action under external pressure from Cruise or Viacom. \nResponding to a query by Wikinews reporters, YouTube stated \"We have not received a DMCA notification letter from Viacom.\" The Church of Scientology was offered the opportunity to respond to the claims made by Stollery during the interview. No reply was received.\nThis exclusive interview deals with these issues and others relating to the website. It was conducted with Glen via email between March 21 and April 3, 2006.\nInterview with Glen Stollery.\nCults have always interested me for years simply based on their mystery/ability to draw unwavering devotion to in some case absolutely ludicrous premises even from otherwise very intelligent people. As such for probably all of my adult life I've read books on persuasion, unconscious influence,\nLGAT (large group awareness training) and for want of a better term \"brain washing\"; I've also always looked to improve myself in all areas I can so at the same time I would also read self improvement material. However, my interest in cults really peaked in 2003. I was a Tony Robbins advocate, and when attending an \"unleash the power within\" weekend live seminar I saw to my horror it had some striking makings of a LGAT/\"/EST/\" type event, with cultish rituals such as 15-18 hour days with almost no breaks for food or even the bathroom, repetitive chanting, unconscious influence techniques, a charismatic leader, and strict guidelines that could even be seen as totalitarian.\nFrom there I researched Robbins further, as well as other groups using similar practices such as Landmark Forum and Scientology, and although I do not believe Robbins is leading a destructive cult, I do believe he uses unconscious persuasion, building participants into a frenzy and subjecting them to intense peer pressure and group dynamics in an effort to sell additional products/services whilst they are in this heightened state. I read pro-Scientology material like Dianetics (as best as one can) and \"Clear Body, Clear Mind\", and all of the church OT material, as well as many critic's books such as \"L. Ron Hubbard, Messiah or Madman\", \"A Piece of Blue Sky\", \"Bare-Faced Messiah\", and of course all the critical websites I could find to really see inside the cult without going \"inside\" the cult.\nIt was when Tom Cruise began his very vocal promotion of Scientology and more specifically his fierce opposition to psychiatric medication that I decided I would act and create the site. The thought of young impressionable fans following any of his advice and dropping their meds or joining the cult make me sick to the pit of my stomach, so my theory was I could poke some fun through parody whilst at the same time getting across a few serious home truths about Scientology.\nThe website itself is very basic. There's no dynamic pages, shopping cart, or database to run so I simply quickly wrote up the HTML myself. As such the site cost nothing to build, though in October last year when Scientology's lawyers threatened me with the lawsuit and it was suddenly in every newspaper the site had just under 10 million hits in 3 weeks, and the gigabytes downloaded did cost me a bit. It was then I moved the videos to a third party provider and that's worked perfectly.\nJust me! Though I received and still do receive a huge amount of support through xenu.net and alt.religion.scientology, as dozens of critics have been threatened just as I was.\nThe real tipping point for me was Tom Cruise's statements about psych meds. Scientology owns a front group specifically to oppose psych meds and psychiatrists called CCHR (Citizens Commission on Human Rights), staunchly opposing ALL medication of that genre. Cruise's numerous statements that no one should be using any psychiatric medication was not only ignorant but darn right dangerous. Life threatening in fact. Cruise stated that the opposed Brooke Shield's use of medication for post-partum depression, and that she was ignorant about the history of psychiatry - well he is most certainly ignorant of the circumstances of every medicated individual in the world, and as such his comments that people should get off the meds and take vitamins and exercise was absolutely outrageous.\nI am not anti-Cruise... before he started this propaganda regime I would have proudly stated I was a Cruise fan! But c'mon let's be realistic here; no one can possibly argue that it isn't irresponsible for Tom Cruise to effectively tell every child and adult on prescribed medication for a \"chemical imbalance\" (a mental illness like depression, bi-polar, schizophrenia, ADD/ADHD, etc.) to suddenly stop their meds and start \u201cexercising and taking vitamins.\u201d\nThink about how many people his statements could have (and from the over 1000 posts on my website \"has had\") on those who are unwell? It was irresponsible, ignorant, and dangerous; and if my site pokes a little fun at him for doing that and possibly makes those people think twice before following his advice, then I'm happy.\nIf you take a close look at the site you'll see that I actually make little comment and let the videos speak for themselves. When people see Tom jumping on Oprah's couch declaring his undying love for a woman he just met, followed by his completely out of character argument with Matt Lauer about medication and Scientology (calling him glib, stating he was an expert in medicine as if he [had a] Ph.D., and then repeating himself over and over again), followed by his appearance on \"60 Minutes\" where he threatens to walk out when, then lying to a reporter at a press conference about alien's having any involvement in the tenets of Scientology... well, they soon work it out themselves!\nI believe he's a reasonably smart guy who unfortunately has been, for want of a better term; \"brain-washed\" into believing the teachings of L. Ron Hubbard. I mean, he quotes him verbatim. All the \"no such thing as a chemical imbalance\" \"psychiatry causing WWI and WWII\" \"electro-shocking children\" \"psychiatric industry producing a nation of drug addicts\" - all comes from the writings of Scientology and the CCHR. And, of course he's entitled to his own opinion - he just shouldn't force it on everyone else and use his position as a household name more responsibly.\nWell, \"coincidentally\" the \"same day\" Viacom pulled the South Park episode about Scientology off-air reportedly due to Cruise's pressure to drop all promotion of MI3 if they didn't the site hosting all my videos pulled them citing \"removed at the request of the owner\".\nJust like Viacom was saying \"It wasn't Tom that make us pull South Park Trapped in the Closet it was because of respect for Mr. Hayes\" obviously the videos were NOT pulled at my request. I received no notice, warning, or communication of any kind (sort of rude after pulling many, many millions of new viewers to their site!) nor are they even replying to requests as to what happened.\nThey even pulled original work that was created for us exclusively and we were the only copyright holders of! On the same day Viacom announced they were pulling South Park? Occam's Razor points directly at Cruise involvement here as well.\nDefinitely not all of them! Many of the videos were on YouTube (the hosting company) already, so I simply linked to those files. Others were linked to directly from the copyright holders (like MSNBC, Access Hollywood, 60 Minutes, CNN, etc.) so again we didn't actually infringe on the copyright, simply pointed our site at their file. Others were snippets of video that were held under \"fair use\" for commentary purposes.\nNo, because as I mentioned ours were removed, and YouTube's policy is to remove the video and inform the user - not state that we requested their removal.\nIt was sent from the Church's and RTC's (the company that actually owns all Scientology's trademarks) law firm \"Moxon and Kobrin\" and essentially said I must immediately cease and desist using the domain as it infringed on their trademark \"Scientology\" and was causing confusion as (they claim) my site was being mistaken for theirs, citing breach of the Lanham Act. I was told to immediately transfer ownership to them or face a USD $100,000 lawsuit.\nYes. Originally I had a 'knee-jerk' reaction and told them \"okay\" and bought [the domain name] \"passionofcruise.info\". Then I met with a trademark lawyer and a commercial lawyer specializing in suits like this and found that their claims were without any merit whatsoever.\nThe local church called me for several weeks playing \"good cop\" - he never mentioned lawsuits or the like just kept wanting to meet with me to \"chat about it\" (I refused). But no, never heard from the law firm again.\nNo. I think they got their just desserts."}

If no results comes within six weeks, then the members are to be given another 12 weeks to attempt to form an executive. After that, if no result is achieved by November 24, then the salaries of all members will be suspended, and the Irish government will be given greater influence in Northern Ireland.\nThe Assembly has been suspended since October 2002 following the allegation of the existence of a republican spy ring.\nBlair and Ahern acknowledged the diffculty of implementation of the plan, which has been hampered by the murder this week of Denis Donaldson, a former British spy in Sinn Fein.\nBlair said of the plan, \"We have today set out a framework, beginning with the recall of the assembly on the 15th of May and running up to November of this year, for that ultimate decision to be made. At that point we close the chapter ... or we close the book.\" His verdict on the plan was, \"If the parties really can't find a way forward, we have to call a halt and find a different way forward.\"\nAhern said, \"It is time to talk and to agree. People are entitled to firm assurances that if there is deadlock that it will not be allowed to continue indefinitely.\" His verdict on the plan was, \"I don't look at the end date of this. In fact, I look at this as a start of a process. I do not want on 24 November to be thinking about another plan.\"\nIan Paisley, the leader of the Democratic Unionist Party said \"The DUP will not be forced, rushed or bullied into accepting any level of IRA criminality. Currently there is no evidence that Sinn Fein/IRA will be any further advanced in giving up criminality in November.\" Paisley also denounced the involvement of the Irish government, saying, \"This part of the UK is not really a part of the UK but is a part of the UK where a foreign government has more say over Northern Ireland than the people of Northern Ireland.\"\nGerry Adams, the President of Sinn Fein, said that the statement contained \"negatives and positives.\" \"We welcome that the assembly has been brought together ... we have concerns about the timeframe, about other aspects of the statement, but we think that's a good forward step. We would like to think that unionism generally would see it as a positive opportunity. I appeal to Unionism to seize this opportunity. It is about a shared future for all the people on this island. It appears that they [the two governments] are saying to the DUP, 'If you don't come on board, we are going to go ahead without you.' \"\nThe leader of the Ulster Unionist Party, Sir Reg Empey's response was, \"We urgently need to have an input into, and make changes to, direct rule decisions on education, water rates and the Review of Public Administration, to name but three. This is our job.\" Empey was also critical of the DUP's statement, saying, \"We have been told by the Democratic Unionist Party that the Belfast agreement was binned, consigned to the dustbin of history. Looking and listening to today's press conference, it didn't look binned to me. It's actually back centre stage.\"\nThe SDLP's Mark Durkan said, \"All we have today is an 11-paragraph announcement that tells us less rather than more. That's why the SDLP will need to see the legislation that follows it. It may be better \u2014 or indeed worse.\" He further added, \"A shadow assembly was agreed between the DUP and Sinn Fein in 2004, in the so called comprehensive agreement. We are still living with the damage caused by that bad deal.\"\nUnited States President George W. Bush issued a statement saying, \"Today is an opportunity for all in Northern Ireland to take control of their future and bring the political process to a successful completion this year.\" \"We remain steadfast in our support of the peace process and the efforts of the British and Irish governments to achieve a lasting peace under the principles of the Good Friday Agreement.\""}

The streak begain on August 23, 2005. After two games into the 2006 regular season, he went 0-4 in a 4-2 loss against St.Louis, promptly ending his pursuit of the impressive record 56 game feat accomplished by Joe Dimaggio in 1941. Another record that Rollins' was chasing has been largely overlooked. The National League hit streak record shared by Pete Rose(1978) and Willie Keeler(1897) was 44 games, just 6 more than Rollins' accomplished.\nThe streak was not without controversy. Many contested that the streak should not count due to the fact that it spanned two seasons. The major league marks for longest hitting streak in one season and longest hitting streak spanning two seasons are separate records. For example, Willie Keeler's hitting streak was accomplished in one season in 1897. He also had a hit in the last game in 1896, making his streak 45 over two seasons. Others believed that the streak was more difficult since Rollins had to wait six months before trying to start again. \"I think it will be almost a little bit more special if he ends up going as far because of the layoff,\" Cardinals shortstop David Eckstein said before the streak ended."}

On Friday, March 31, Johnson had apparently fallen into the waters of the Ala Wai Yacht Harbor, located at the mouth of the Ala Wai Canal on the western side of Waikiki. \nAt the time, the canal and surrounding beaches were contaminated by over 48 million gallons of untreated sewage. The extent to which the sewage spill contributed to Johnson's symptoms remains unclear.\nJohnson earlier reported that he had fallen accidentally into the harbor, then later indicated that he had been involved in a fight on board a boat and had been pushed or thrown into the harbor waters. A security guard at Johnson's apartment reported that he was bloodied and soaking wet, and that he stumbled into the lobby and collapsed. Paramedics took Johnson to Straub Hospital where he was treated and released.\nJohnson reported steadily worsening leg pain that weekend and was admitted to Queen's Hospital on Sunday with breathing difficulties. Doctors that night amputated his left leg above the knee to try to halt the spread of the infection, and Johnson was placed in a medically induced coma. \nInitially suspecting that Johnson had contracted streptococcus-caused necrotizing fasciitis, doctors later found that Johnson had contracted three different bacteria, two of which, vibrio vulnificus and aeromonas hydrophila, have flesh-eating properties. Despite the amputation, Johnson's condition steadily worsened to the point where doctors said that his other leg and left arm would also have needed to be amputated to save his life.\nAn autopsy performed by the Honolulu medical examiner's office reported that Johnson had suffered from massive organ failure caused by septic shock. The medical examiner noted that Johnson had a vulnificus infection on his foot and suffered from chronic alcoholic liver disease which may have contributed to the infection's taking hold.\nThe Honolulu Police Department has opened a third-degree assault case; with Johnson's death, homicide detectives are also investigating. State health officials are also investigating Johnson's illness.\nJohnson's family has retained an attorney to investigate the causes surrounding his illness and death. It is not clear yet whether any legal action will be taken.\nRelated Stories.\nSewage spill fouls Waikiki Beach March 31, 2006"}

In March, 2006, Rep. Ron Paul introduced a bill (HR 4892) requiring the Federal Reserve to reverse its decision. "}

The Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO), whose main mission pertains to mapping the Moon, will send a spent fuel stage and an impactor probe towards a crater on the South Pole. The crater seems to be rich in hydrogen and possibly ice. \nThe mission is part of the run-up to trying to land astronauts back on the Moon, and perhaps keep them there for a longer period of time than the Apollo missions did. Scott Horowitz, NASA's associate administrator for the Exploration Systems Mission Directorate, had this to say: \"What this mission buys is an early attempt to know what some of the resources we\u2019re going to have ... we know for sure that for human exploration to succeed we\u2019re going to have to essentially live off the land.\" \nTwice before, with the Pentagon's Clementine spacecraft and with the Lunar Prospector, scientists have seen hints of ice on the Moon's surface. It is NASA's hope that this mission may provide better answers to the question of water ice on the Moon. This would prove useful to the agency's goal of a four-astronaut mission to the Moon by 2020. \nThe Probe.\nThe name of the project is the Lunar Crater Observation and Sensing Satellite, or LCROSS for short. It will launch with the LRO in October 2008 and use its onboard cameras and spectrometers to watch the impact of its upper stage into the surface. The upper stage roughly resembles an SUV in mass - around 4,409 pounds.\nThe project manager, Daniel Andrews said: \"We will create a substantial plume and excavate some sample material, some of which we think will be water ice.\" After the first crash, LCROSS will attempt to fly through the plume of debris, taking readings and sending them back to Earth. Once done, it will itself crash into a different region of the crater, allowing both the LRO and stations on Earth to observe the plume that it creates."}

The government has denied any wrongdoing. In a press conference on Monday, the Prime Minister defended his ministers. \"I do not believe, on the information known to me that any of my Ministers have been guilty of dereliction of duty and I am very, very happy to provide the statement and, if asked, to appear.\"\nThe Australian Trade Minister, Mark Vaile, and Foreign Affairs minister, Alexander Downer appeared before the Inquiry this week. During questioning, both men rejected all suggestion that they made any mistakes or acted in any way innapropriately.\nOn Monday Mark Vaile repeatedly answered that he \"couldn't recall\" details of whether he was aware of the many warnings given to the government from various sources that dealings between the AWB, formerly the Australian Wheat Board, and the Iraq government were corrupt and supplied the pre-invasion Iraq government with up to 300 million dollars of funding.\nAlexander Downer spent 3 hours before the commission on Tuesday and said that he could not specifically recall the details of any of the 21 cables containing warnings about the possibility of kickbacks being paid to the Iraqi government. He claimed that he did not have time to read all the material in his department and spent much of the year travelling. The Labor Party opposition has pointed to the fact that this testament seems to contradict statements previously made to parliament.\nThe commission also received a written statement from Howard, which will be assessed by the inquiry's lawyers to determine whether he should be called before the inquiry.

This was Mickelson's second consecutive major as well as his second green jacket. In a five-way tie for third place at four under par were Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Olaz\u00e1bal, Retief Goosen, Tiger Woods, Chad Campbell, and Fred Couples. Rounding out the top ten were eighth place finishers Angel Cabrera and Vijay Singh followed by Stewart Cink in tenth place.\nAlthough Mickelson had to fire up during the last few holes to take the '04 Masters over Ernie Els, nothing of that sort was required during Sunday's round. He parred the first six holes before making two straight birdies at 7 and 8, and then went on to make two more at 13 and 15 before finishing off with a bogey at 18. Last year, Mickelson put Tiger's jacket on for him. This year, Tiger helped Phil into the jacket. \"I certainly enjoyed having the jacket put on me,\" Mickelson said. \"I love the chance to compete against guys like Tiger, guys like Retief and Ernie and Vijay and Fred who are playing so well. It gives me an incredible feeling of accomplishment to be able to come out on top this week.\" After 42 straight misses at majors, Mickelson is now on track with one major per year for the past three years. \nPlaying partner Fred Couples nearly got within one stroke of Mickelson but went on to miss the birdie putt and another par putt to sink out of contention. Putting was also Tiger Woods's major hindrance. He made three three-putts and had an overall total of 33 putts with a final round of 70. Afterwards, Woods remarked, \"It was frustrating. I felt in control of my golf swing from tee to green. Once I got on the green, I was a spaz. I didn't have it all day - even this morning (in the third round) I didn't putt well.\" Clark capped off a great run and a final round 69 with a chip-in from the sand at 18 for a birdie.

Hersh, American military and intelligence officials were making plans for a massive nuclear strike on Iran in order to stop the country developing nuclear weapons. The story also said that US special forces were already operating in Iran gathering target information.\nThe Iranian government insists that its nuclear development program is purely for meeting civilian energy needs, but several intelligence agencies around the world believe that Iran's true goal is to develop nuclear weapons. The International Atomic Energy Agency has said that it has not seen indications of diversion of nuclear material to nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices after several years of intensive inspections in Iran, but has also expressed uncertainty about the nature of Iran's nuclear program and called for confidence building measures from Iran. \nA former US intelligence official claimed that Iran's president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, is referred to as \"the new Adolf Hitler\" within the White House. Some military officials believe that Bush wants a \"regime change\" in Iran. President Ahmadinejad has previously disputed the existence of the Holocaust and at a conference discussing Zionism, he described Ayatollah Khomeini's statement that Israel as an occupying force in Palestine should be \"wiped off the map\" as \"a wise statement\".\nAn anonymous Pentagon official said \"This White House believes that the only way to solve the problem is to change the power structure in Iran, and that means war. It also reinforces the belief inside Iran that the only way to defend the country is to have a nuclear capability.\"\nUS aircraft flying from carriers in the Arabian Sea have been flying practice nuclear weapon missions within range of Iranian radar, widely seen as an effort to intimidate Iran.\nIn the last few years Iran has been constructing a series of underground facilities to support its work. Colonel Sam Gardiner, a military analyst, says there are over 400 targets in Iran that would need to be destroyed to end Iran's nuclear program. In one option of a plan reportedly presented to the White House by the Pentagon this winter, \"bunker-busting\" mini-nuclear weapons would be used to penetrate the deepest-buried facilities, some of which are 75 feet below the surface. \nAn insider claimed that the Joint Chiefs of Staff tried to remove the nuclear option from the plan, citing problems of huge casualties and radioactive contamination, but the White House retained it. Another source claimed that while nuclear weapons were seeing more interest amongst civilian staff and within \"policy circles\", military officers remained very much opposed to their potential use, with some high-level officers threatening resignation.\nThe insider said \"if senior Pentagon officers express their opposition to the use of offensive nuclear weapons, then it will never happen\".\nWhen asked about the veracity of the claims made in the New Yorker article, the White House said \"As the President has indicated, we are pursuing a diplomatic solution\". The Defense Department also said that Iran was being dealt with through \"diplomatic channels\". The C.I.A. said that there were \"inaccuracies\" in the account.\nSince then, Bush has described the plan as \"wild speculation\", without denying it, in a speech delivered at Johns Hopkins University in Washington DC.\n\"The doctrine of prevention is to work together to prevent the Iranians from having a nuclear weapon,\" he said. \"I know here in Washington prevention means force. It doesn't mean force necessarily. In this case it means diplomacy. What you are reading is just wild speculation which happens quite frequently here in the nation's capital.\"\nJack Straw said \"the idea of a nuclear strike on Iran is completely nuts.\" Speaking on a BBC television show, Straw said \"I have made clear the British Government's position on this time and time again which is widely shared across Europe.\"\n\"The American administration, Condoleezza Rice, [and] President Bush use slightly different language. They say that it is not on the agenda. They are very committed indeed to resolving this issue - it is a complicated issue - by negotiation and, yes, by diplomatic pressure. \"\nStraw stated that the UK would not launch a pre-emptive strike on Iran, going on to say that he was as \"certain as he could be\" that neither would the US."}

Mr Vaile said that if a particular cable needed his attention it was generally put into a ministerial submission. He said that such submissions may require ministerial action, while others just contain information which he may need to make a note of. Once the submission has been read, the minister signs it and it goes into the system.\nMr Vaile told the commission that on occasion he receives information from cables via briefings from his advisors and departmental officers.\nWhen questioned about a cable sent to the department of trade containing concerns raised by the UN about AWB's dealings in Iraq dated January 13, 2000, Mr Vaile said that he was briefed in a general sense on the issues raised. Despite the UN's concerns being stated in the cable, Mr Vaile said that he \"can't recall being aware of the substance\".\nMr Vaile said he was under the belief that the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) and Australia's UN mission were taking care of the UN's concerns. He said that he did not have responsibility over the issues being raised \"That's my recollection, and my recollection is that there were concerns that had been raised about an AWB contract, and that DFAT and the Mission in New York were dealing with it, bearing in mind that I was not - I didn't have direct ministerial responsibility for either the UN Mission in New York or the Oil-for-Food Program\" he said.\nWhen asked if he would have expected to be briefed in detail on the issues in the cable, Mr Vaile said \"Given the circumstances at the time, in terms of my direct ministerial responsibility and being new in the portfolio, probably not.\"\nMr Vaile told the inquiry that he was surprised that he had not been briefed about a cable dated March 11, 2000 from Austrade to the department of trade. The summary of the document said \"It may be necessary to advise the minister of the situation.\"\nThe inquiry heard that in April, 2000 Mr Vaile was told by an advisor that the issue raised in January, 2000 had been resolved with the UN.\nWhen questioned by Mr Agius about why he did not follow up on the allegations made against AWB in 2000, Mr Vaile said he was too snowed under with work. \"My best recollections are that I was pretty well snowed under in taking on the responsibilities of a new portfolio and the breadth of issues, having come from a much narrower base in the previous portfolio, and I recall early in 2000 being very, very focused on what to do next in the WTO process after the Seattle ministerial failed in the December of 1999\" he told the inquiry.\nMr Agius then questioned Mr Vaile about allegations made by US Wheat Associates in 2003 that AWB had been inflating wheat prices to Iraq. At the same time there were also allegations that money was being paid to Hussein's regime, that AWB was not being transparent in their dealings. At the time Mr Vaile defended AWB based upon information provided to him by his department. He claims that it was some time later that he learned the information he was given was provided to the department by AWB. Mr Vaile said that his department did not conduct an investigation into the allegations despite them being raised in 2000 and again in 2003 by separate parties.\nMr Vaile also admits that at the time, he dismissed the allegations made by US Wheat Associates as he believed that they were putting pressure on the US administration with regards to WTO negotiations between Australia and the US.\nMr Vaile told the inquiry that the first ha became aware of possible corruption with connected with AWB was in April, 2004. The inquiry heard that Mr Vaile and Alexander Downer (Australia's foreign minister) had received a submission claiming that AWB had acted properly, but the company they paid to transport wheat in Iraq had been paying kickbacks to Hussein's regime. Mr Vaile said that at the time he saw no need to review procedures within his department for the distribution of information regarding AWB.\nAccording to Mr Vaile, the only time the department of trade investigated its files to locate information it had received on AWB's dealings in Iraq was around March 2004 to assist the UN's inquiry into the Oil-for-Food programme."}

Mario was allegedly a bouncer at the club. \"Police said he is a cousin of Keith Bender Jr., the bouncer who was allegedly shot by Proof during the fight.\" The fight that started inside the club was reported to be over a pool game. The argument was taken outside where, \"A shot was fired in the air, Proof allegedly pistol-whipped Bender, knocked him to the ground and then shot him. Etheridge then allegedly opened fire on the rapper, striking him four times in the head and chest. One week later, Keith Bender Jr. died of his injuries on April 18, 2006.\nOfficial Police reports are yet to determine the series of events which left Proof and Keith Bender, 35, deceased. Bender died 8 days later on April 18, 2006. Following Proof's death, rapper Snoop Dogg called on fellow musicians to unite, describing the incident as \"a loss to the hip-hop community\".\nThe tributes were led by fellow rapper The Game who was first to comment on the tragedy. The Game remembers how he and Proof became 'real cool and real homies' and that 'Proof will always be remembered and I as well as the Black Wall Street family will keep his memory &amp; his family in our prayers 1'. The second to comment on Proof was long time friend Royce da 5'9\" who was deeply saddened by the death of his good friend. Royce had been a friend of Proof for over 9 years and the two had recently reconciled. Royce echoed the music community, saying 'He is such loss for the hip hop community...I hope that he will be remembered for the talented artist and great person that he was, and not the tragedy that he fell victim to'. \nEminem was the third to discuss Proof's death days after his passing, clearly affected by the tragedy. Eminem described Proof as \"funny, smart and charming\" and said that he would be sorely missed and described him as \"the heart and ambassador of Detroit hip-hop\". Eminem said that Proof was, and always will be, his best friend.\nTributes poured out of the UK with Vm2k6 leading the remembrance. Proof's demise which was mainly overlooked by the UK media was documented and reflected by VM2k6 in which he calls Proof 'fresh, talented and meaningful, a rarity in Hip Hop today'. He continues saying that Proof had 'the greatest ability to transfer his experiences and most of all feelings into words' and finished with the heartfelt line- 'I guess its only in Death you really begin to shine'. \nSeveral fan videos were released in tribute to Proof, including the hit \"Good Die Young\" music video which used D12's 2004 single, which is currently one of the highest discussed and viewed videos on YouTube.com. Many other \"slide show\" flicks were created, which are appearing all over the internet. The \"Good Die Young\" clip was produced by RYKE Video Productions.\nProof stated how he wanted to be remembered in an interview with Sohh.com shortly after his album release; 'I want people to say that I was a true artist', ' That I did it best and stayed true to Hip Hop roots' and 'I'd want people to understand I did it for the love not for the charts.'

Mr Downer admitted that he did not have the time to read diplomatic cables and the only time he did so was when he is \"stuck on a plane\" and has nothing else to read.\nThe claims are in stark contrast to a statement made to parliament in February where Mr Downer said \"Of course I would have read them\".\nWhen asked why the department of foreign affairs and trade did nothing about the allegations first received in 2000, he told the inquiry that his department couldn't investigate AWB and responsibility for the oil for food program laid with the UN. \" The department does not have the legal authority to go into AWB and access their files\" he said.\n\"They (the UN) also had people on the ground in Iraq because insofar as there could be infringements of the sanctions regime, those infringements could take place within Iraq and Australia had no access to Iraq during that period.\" Mr Downer told the inquiry.\nMr Downer admitted that the department of foreign affairs and trade had dealt with each cable, despite he not reading them and that were satisfied with assurances from AWB that there was no substance to the allegations.\nMr Downer was also asked about an unassessed intelligence report, sent to the National Security Committee of cabinet which raised concerns about Alia, the Jordanian trucking company used by the AWB to transport wheat around Iraq. The document alleged that Alia may have been paying kickbacks to the Iraqi regime.\nMr Downer told the inquiry that the intelligence may not have been dealt with.\"There is so much intelligence. It's a very major challenge, to deal with intelligence\" he said. \nWhen asked by Terry Forrest, counsel for AWB executives what the point of sending intelligence to his department when it was never read, Mr Downer conceded that it was \"physically impossible\" to read it all.\nMr Downer was also questioned about a cable delivered in June 2003 from US army captain Puckett which claimed that every contract under the UN's oil for food program contained a kickback. Mr Downer told the inquiry he didn't see the cable as being important because the information was provided by \"a junior officer in the US army\".\nMr Downer denied claims made by former AWB executive Andrew Lindberg that he had been told about the possibility that money may have been paid to Iraq by Alia. According to Mr Downer it is common practice in his department to have two advisors at such meetings, where one of them takes notes so there is a record of what is said. According to Mr Downer, no notes were taken during the meeting despite it being \"the usual practice\".\nMr Downer told the inquiry that he had no idea why notes weren't taken during the meeting, despite the meeting being quite important. He also told the inquiry that he couldn't recall if he noticed that nobody was taking notes as he would have been \"focused a little more on the meeting than on somebody taking notes\"."}

They relayed their results back to Washington, where Warrick said in the front page \"Washington Post\" article that the newspaper interviewed six of the nine group members.\nAccording to \"The Washington Post\", this preliminary report was followed up with a detailed 122 page final report three weeks later, titled \"Final Technical Engineering Exploitation Report on Iraqi Suspected Biological Weapons-Associated Trailers.\" The report remains classified to this date.\nReuters reported that an unnamed U.S. official confirmed the existence of the field report filed on May 27, 2003, and said that the field report had not been evaluated at the time of Bush's statement. \"You don't change a report that has been coordinated in the (intelligence) community based on a field report,\" he reportedly said. The Bush administration continued to make claims about having found mobile biological weapons facilities throughout 2003. \nOn June 8, 2003, an unnamed senior CIA official stood by the interpretation that the trailers were mobile bioweapons labs saying \"It is what we think it is, to the best of our knowledge\".\nThen Secretary of State Colin Powell claimed in June 2003 that \"confidence level is increasing\" that the trailers were intended for biological weapons production. \nWhite House speaker Scott McClellan said on July 16, 2003, that \"We've seen some of the evidence of his weapons of mass destruction program through two mobile biological weapon labs that have been discovered.\"\nVice President Dick Cheney claimed in September 2003 that the trailers were \"mobile biological facilities\". Then CIA director George Tenet claimed in a speech on February 5, 2004, that the trailers \"could be made to work\" as biological weapons labs. \nThe alleged existence of mobile biological weapons laboratories was one of the cornerstones in Colin Powell's presentation in front of the United Nations to make the case for war on February 5, 2003. Much of the information came from an Iraqi defector dubbed Curveball who was an asset of the German BND. The credibility of this source was disputed by the BND.\nThe Iraq Survey Group reported in September 2004 that the trailers were \"impractical\" for biological agent production and \"almost certainly\" designed and built for the generation of hydrogen. Asked about the prospects to turn the trailers into biological weapons labs, Rod Barton, a member of the Iraq Survey Group, said \"It would be easier to start all over with just a bucket\". \nThe Washington Post cites unnamed sources among officials and members of the initial survey group as claiming that the original classified report from May 27, 2003 and the classified final report three weeks later came to the same conclusions as the unclassified findings of the Iraqi Survey Group. \nScott Ritter, a former United Nations weapons inspector, wrote September 8, 2003:\n\"However, it now is clear that these so- called labs were nothing more than hydrogen generation units based upon British technology acquired by Iraq in the 1980s, used to fill weather balloons in support of conventional artillery operations, and have absolutely no application for the production of biological agents.\"\nIn the April 12, 2006 press conference, Scott McClellan said \"I will point out that the reporting I saw this morning was simply reckless and it was irresponsible. The lead in The Washington Post left the impression for the reader that the President was saying something he knew at the time not to be true. \u2026 The President's statements were based on the joint assessment of the CIA and DIA that was publicly released the day before [the President made his statements].\" \nHe did not answer repeated questions whether the President knew of the secret report at the time he was asserting that \"we found biological laboratories\" on May 29, 2005. When asked why the secret report was not made public earlier McClellan responded by saying that \"it takes a substantial amount of time to coordinate and run through a declassification process\"."}

Mr. Hurndall died nine months later from the single gunshot wound to the head. \nOn Thursday April 6, the same court decided that the award-winning cameraman James Miller, 34, was also intentionally shot in the neck by an Israeli sniper three weeks previous to the Hurndall shooting. Both men were shot within a mile of each other near Rafa in the Gaza strip.\nThe cases were presided over by Dr Andrew Reid, who said he would be writing to the UK Attorney General Lord Goldsmith to see if there was any further legal action which could be taken in relation to the deaths of Tom Hurndall and James Miller. \nThe five man, five woman jury at Saint Pancras Coroners Court in north London complained of a lack of cooperation by the Israeli authorities in their investigation of both cases.

The inquest reveled that just before he was killed shots were fired from an IDF watchtower, causing Palestinians children to flee. One child froze and Mr Hurndall went to help but was shot in the head. Sergeant Taysir Hayb was convicted of manslaughter by an Israeli court and jailed for eight years for shooting him.\nJames Miller was killed on his last day of work on a HBO film titled \"Death in Gaza\" a documentary about the impact of violence upon children in the conflict zone which has gone on to win three Emmys and a Bafta. He was reportedly filming Palestinian children throwing stones at Israeli tanks in Rafah at the time. The shooting was described as \"slow, deliberate, calculated and aimed\". He was approaching soldiers from the IDF (Israeli Defense Force) while holding a white flag when he was shot by Lieutenant Hib al Haib of the Bedouin Desert Reconnaissance Unit.\nBritish Legislator, Gerald Kaufman said Tuesday, sanctions must be imposed against Israel if it does not hand over officers and troops suspected of being responsible for the killing of the two British men."}

Your enemy has begun to falter, so don't stop pursuing him until he flees defeated,\" said Zawahiri in the tape which was believed to have been made in November 2005.\n\"I warn all Muslims in Iraq: Anyone who impedes the jihad against the Crusader occupiers is a traitor to God and his prophet ... and a traitor to the rest of the Muslims,\" he added.\nZawahiri also accused United States President George W. Bush of being the \"Caesar of Washington.\"\n\"Bush, son of Bush, eliminating Israel is the duty of every believer. If we commit to peaceful action, they will demand we adhere to international laws and treaties that mean nothing to them. If we adhere to that, they will ask us to impose constraint on what they call terrorism and war on Israel. Then if we adhere to that, they will demand we recognize Israel and establish normal relations with it,\" Zawahiri continued.\nZawahiri also praised Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the leader of an Iraqi militant group, calling him his \"beloved brother\" and says, \"I have lived with him up close and have seen nothing but good from him.\"\nZawahiri has made at least three other tapes since November, all of which were broadcast by Al-Jazeera. He appeared in two tapes in January, and in one tape on March 4, 2006. The latest video was not released immediately after the date it was allegedly filmed, nor has Al-Jazeera yet broadcast the video by Zawahiri despite having broadcast his three previous tapes.\nAl-Qaeda's leader, Osama Bin Laden, released an audio tape on January 19, 2006. Parts of that tape were aired on Al-Jazeera and it was the first time in over a year that Bin Laden had been heard."}

Two of those killed appeared to have been shot in the head by live bullets.\nKathmandu was under a curfew from 2 a.m. to 8 p.m. local time on April 20. Non-governmental organizations such as the United Nations and the Red Cross were denied permission to move through the city during the curfew, and journalists were also denied curfew passes. The United Nations Office for the High Commissioner for Human Rights called the move a \"clear violation\" of their agreement with the Nepali government.\nThe curfew was reportedly extended until 3 a.m. local time Friday. Protestors intend to continue protests on Friday.\nGyanendra assumed direct rule in February 2005, citing the failure of political parties to control a Maoist insurgency that has killed 13,000 people. He has pledged free elections by April 2007, but an alliance of political parties has demanded he relinquish power to an all-party government immediately.\nThe protests have touched all areas of Nepalese society. As an example, a peaceful protest meeting called by the Nepal Bar Association was fired upon by Nepalese police on April 13, 2006. About 1500 people took part in the protest which took place at Babarmahal in Kathmandu. 50 were reportedly injured in the firing. Nepal Bar Association President Shambu Thampa was one of the casualties. It is not clear at this time whether the police used rubber, or live bullets. After the protest, tear gas shells were used to disperse the crowd. The authorities reportedly detained 72 people.\nLater that day, around 100 people were arrested at a rally in a stadium at Maitighar. Most of those detained were associated with the Association of International NGOs (AIN)."}

He told the press that his government is being open about the Iraqi kickback affair. \" just want to make one point and that is that the appearance by me, earlier this week by the Foreign Minister and also by the Trade Minister, demonstrates absolutely how open and transparent and accountable the Government is being in relation to this matter\" Mr Howard said to reporters.\nMr Howard was questioned by John Agius, counsel assisting the inquiry. Counsel for AWB, the company at the centre of the scandal did not apply to cross-examine the prime minister.\nTerrence Cole, the inquiry's commissioner received an application from Peter Geary and Micheal Long's counsel to cross-examine the prime minister but refused it on the grounds that the proposed line of questioning was similar to that of Mr Aguis' and that there was no evidence that Mr Howard had \"ever met with Mr Geary or Mr Long\".\nMr Agius questioned the prime minister about a series of diplomatic cables sent to his office, which raised concerns about AWB's contracts in Iraq.\nMr Howard told the inquiry that he doesn't recall reading or being briefed about any of the cables referred to by the inquiry. The inquiry also heard that prior to 2003 there was no system in place to identify which cables had been bought to the prime minister's attention.\nIn his statement to the inquiry, Mr Howard said that his office had not received four of the cables mentioned by the inquiry. Under questioning, Mr Howard confirmed this but conceded that it was likely that his staff had read the other 17.\nWhen asked whether there were any guidelines which guided his advisors in deciding which cables should be bought to the prime minister's attention, Mr Howard replied \"No, there weren't\".\nThe inquiry heard that the only discussions about which cables which should be bought to Mr Howard's attention occurred when an advisor changed in very generic terms. Mr Howard told the inquiry that he would tell a new advisor \"Well, you've got to exercise your own judgment, I can't possibly read everything, and clearly I want things brought to my attention which are, in your judgment, important and are relevant to issues in front of the government at the time\".\nMr Howard admitted that the government had an interest in Iraq using the United Nations oil for food program for its own financial benefit, but said he did not expect cables dealing with alleged breach of UN sanctions to have been bought to his attention.\nThe questioning then turned to a statement Mr Howard made to the National Press Club on March 13, 2003, one week prior to the US-led Iraqi occupation. Speaking about Saddam Hussein Mr Howard said \"He has cruelly and cynically manipulated the United Nations oil-for-food programme. He's rorted it to buy weapons to support\nhis designs at the expense of the wellbeing of his people\".\nMr Agius asked Mr Howard if his statement was based upon briefngs he had received. Mr Howard told the inquiry that the information was based upon \"open source\" intelligence stated at addresses by British foreign secretary Jack Straw and the United States state department. Mr Howard said one of his advisors \"checked with some cables to confirm that those cables supported the open-source claims and was satisfied that they did\".\nMr Howard denied seeing the cables used by the advisor to support the claims, but believed he would have told her to be sure that everything they were saying can be supported by fact. Mr Howard told the inquiry that he never knew about cables which referred to Hussein rorting the UN Oil for Food program. Mr Howard admitted that at the time his \"general knowledge\" was that Hussein had breached UN sanctions and was rorting the Oil for Food program.\n\"My general knowledge at the time and belief was that the program had been rorted, and it was not seriously in dispute. Nobody was arguing it hadn't been rorted\" Mr Howard said.\nThe prime minister was questioned about an unassessed intelligence report which mentioned a Jordanian trucking company known as \"Alia\" paying kickbacks to Hussein. In response to this Mr Howard told the inquiry that he could not recall the information being bought to his attention, which was not unusual."}

The explosions were not strong enough to damage the 17th century mosque.\nThe first explosion occurred around 1730 hrs local time (IST) and the second at 1740 hrs. The explosives were reportedly carried in plastic bags. There were around 1000 people in the mosque at the time of blasts as the day happened to be Friday, considered holy by the Muslims as well as because of the fact that it was the first Friday after Milad un Nabi, Prophet Muhammad's birthday. The blasts took place just before the Azaan. Some sources claim that the mosque was almost empty with only 100-150 people in the premises when the blast took place. The first blast occurred near Gate No. 1, a place where people wash their hands before offering prayers.\nThe injured have been admitted to Lok Nayak Jai Prakash Hospital. Alert have been sounded in major mosques in India, especially in Mumbai. Fire trucks, ambulances and bomb disposal squads reached the site and have cordoned off the area for their operations. The nearby shops have been asked to suspend operations. The Delhi State Government has requested the people to maintain calm and announced an ex-gratia compensation of Rs. 50,000 for the seriously injured and Rs. 25,000 for those with minor injuries. It is being speculated that these blasts might be linked with coincidental six grenade attacks in Srinagar, that took place the same day. As of 15th April, no terrorist group has claimed the responsibility of the blasts. The Delhi police have arrested four people and are questioning them for the blasts. However, the police have ruled out involvement of any major terrorist group because of the crude nature of explosives.\nType of explosive.\nIt has been established that the explosives used in the blast were very crude in nature and consisted of Potassium chlorate and Sulphuric acid. These two were separated by a rubber wall. When the acid corroded the rubber to make contact with the Potassuim chlorate on the other side, the explosion was triggered."}

Underwood has been arrested on suspicion of first-degree murder and is being held without bail. He has no criminal record or history of mental illness.\nThe girl was last seen on Wednesday near the Purcell public library, and her family reported her missing that night. Officials waited until Thursday night to issue an Amber Alert because no abduction was reported.\nUnderwood reportedly drew the suspicion of law enforcement at an information checkpoint set up at the apartment complex. Among the other items found in Underwood's apartment were a decorative dagger, a hacksaw, barbecue skewers, meat tenderizer, and a wooden cutting board, according to police.\nPreliminary autopsy reports find that the girl died of asphyxiation and blunt force trauma to the head. Deep saw marks found on the body indicate that the suspect attempted to decapitate the girl, say authorities.

Moore and U.S. Senator Chuck Hagel (R-Nebraska) spoke during the opening session of the 2005 American Nuclear Society's Winter meeting in November.\nMoore says that his views have changed since founding Greenpeace, and he now believes that using nuclear energy can help counteract catastrophic climate change from burning fossil fuels. Says Moore, \"The 600-plus plants emit nearly 2 billion tons of annually -- the equivalent of the exhaust from about 300 million automobiles.\" Moore also cites reports from the Clean Air Council that coal plants are responsible for 64 percent of sulfur dioxide emissions, 26 percent of nitrous oxides and 33 percent of mercury emissions. \n\"Meanwhile, the 103 nuclear plants operating in the United States effectively avoid the release of 700 million tons of CO2 emissions annually,\" says Moore. \"Nuclear energy is the only large-scale, cost-effective energy source that can reduce these emissions while continuing to satisfy a growing demand for power. And these days it can do so safely.\" Moore points out that the average cost of producing nuclear energy in the United States was less than two cents per kilowatt-hour, comparable with coal and hydroelectric. He predicts that advances in technology will bring the cost down further in the future.\nAccording to Moore, British atmospheric scientist , father of the Gaia theory, also believes that nuclear energy is the only way to avoid catastrophic climate change. Concerns about past accidents in the nuclear industry were also mentioned, as he claims the Chernobyl nuclear disaster as example, calling it \"an accident waiting to happen. This early model of Soviet reactor had no containment vessel, was an inherently bad design and its operators literally blew it up\". He also recognized the difficulty of dealing with nuclear waste.\nMoore was a founding member of Greenpeace in 1971 and was instrumental in its early campaigns, but left the organization in 1986.

Ritter claimed that the CIA had used the MEK \"to carry out remote bombings in Iran of the sort that the Bush administration condemns on a daily basis inside Iraq\".\nEarly this month, Seymour Hersh made a similar statement in New Yorker Magazine about the entry of US troops themselves into Iranian territory, but without supporting the claim that they carried out acts of violence.

An intelligence source quoted by Raw Story said that the former MEK members were made to \"swear an oath to Democracy and resign from the MEK\" before being incorporated into US military units and retrained for their operations in Iran. The MEK is an Iranian opposition group listed by the U.S. State Department as a Foreign Terrorist Organization but describes itself as \"secular\" and \"patriotic, Muslim and democratic\".\nRaw Story cited the UN official saying that \"We are already at war\". Retired U.S. Air Force Colonel Sam Gardiner made similar remarks on CNN on Friday saying \"I would say -- and this may shock some -- I think the decision has been made and military operations are under way.\"\nRaw Story said that the MEK has been used in the Iranian provinces of Baluchistan and Khuzestan and quoted a senior British intelligence official saying that British intelligence believes that the MEK is responsible for the violent attacks in the southern Iran, and that people from a \"US Special mission unit\" are present on Iranian territory, but was unsure as to the links between US military and the MEK.\nAccording to the National Council of Resistance of Iran, which is alleged by the FBI to be \"an integral part of the MEK\", Professor Raymond Tanter of Georgetown University and a former White House aide argued on Al-Jazeera television that the only way to confront Iran's threats is to support the MEK and its removal from the U.S. State Department list of Foreign Terrorist Organizations and from its classification as a terrorist organization by the Council of the European Union.\nRaw Story reports that the office of the Undersecretary of Defense Intelligence did not return calls for comment."}

The amendment was defeated by a vote of 28 to 8.\nNetwork neutrality is a principle of computer networking that describes networks designed so that no communication, application, or service is either given preferential treatment or restricted. \nAdvocates of network neutrality fear that allowing broadband networks to operate unregulated could lead to preferential treatment toward certain companies at the expense of others. Phone companies who oppose network neutrality legislation contend that some mechanism needs to be in place in order to pay for expansion of the public Internet. \nEdward Whitacre, AT&amp;T's chief executive officer, had made remarks on the issue that consumer groups found inflammatory. In remarks made on November 7, 2005, presumably referring to Internet sites using their network connections, he called for \"some mechanism for these people who use these pipes to pay for the portion they're using. Why should they be allowed to use my pipes?\" \nWhitacre has since reversed his public statements, saying on March 21, 2006, \"Any provider that blocks access to content is inviting customers to find another provider. And that's just bad business.\"\nFederal Communications Commission chairman Kevin Martin believes that the FCC already has the authority to enforce network neutrality provisions, citing a North Carolina case in which the FCC acted against Madison River Communications for blocking Vonage VoIP phone service.\nRepresentative from , chairman of the , describes the bill as a way to \"ignite the marketplace \u2014 unleashing great advances in technology and delivering to consumers a variety of new services at a lower cost that were once never even imagined. Every consumer in the nation with a telephone, television and access to the Internet will be better for it \u2014 the wave of the future is now.\" \n, a FCC Commissioner, said recently, \"This Internet may not be the one we know in the future there are threats to it out there... Entrenched interests are already jockeying to constrain the openness that has been the Internet's defining hallmark.\" \nA recent poll done by (See source 5) shows that the Internet has taken on an important role in the daily life of Americans. With two-thirds reporting it is important for personal communications and researching products, over half said it is important for getting news and, about 40 percent cited online banking, e-commerce, and retrieving government information as significant ways in which they used the internet. They expressed a great deal of concern about discriminatory practices of communications network operators.\nThe revision of the 1996 Telecommunications Act was proposed by House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Joe Barton, -, and U.S. Rep. Bobby Rush, -, in late March and went on to the full committee on April 5."}

McCarthy Gipson, Sister Karen Klimczak, 62, a Catholic nun who went missing on Friday, has been found dead in a shallow grave. Her body was found inside a shed in the backyard of an abandoned house just five miles from her home. Police believe that she was either suffocated or strangled and her body did not show any immediate signs of a gunshot wound or a stab wound. They are waiting awaiting the results of an autopsy.\n\"We've lost a tireless champion of the people,\" Buffalo Mayor, Byron W. Brown said on Monday.\nKlimczak founded and lived in the Bissonette House in 1989, a halfway house for ex-convicts who are considered to be non-violent. It was named after Rev. A Joseph Bissonette, a priest that was killed in the house in 1987 by an ex-convict that was residing there.\n\"It is a tremendous tragedy that this repeats itself 19 years later,\" added Brown.\nCraig Lynch, 37, an ex-convict who has been living in the house since April 5, according to Gipson, was arrested and confessed to the murder while also admitting to being on drugs at the time. According to Gipson, however, Lynch said the murder was \"an accident.\" Lynch was paroled in January from Wyoming Correctional Facility after time served from a conviction related to auto theft.\nPolice say he was attempting to steal Klimczak's cellular phone from her room when she returned home on Friday. Detective Sgt. James P. Lonergan, the lead investigator on this case, says Lynch then attacked Klimczak from behind when she got to the door and then proceeded to dispose of the body.\n\"He initially hid the body behind a house on George Street and he covered it with some debris. He [then] went to a shed behind a vacant house and dug a shallow grave, then he brought the body there and put it in the grave,\" said Lonergan.\nThe phone, along with some of the victims clothing and various personal belongings, were found in two different trash cans near her home.\nLynch is expected to be charged with larceny and second-degree murder."}

Under the terms of an agreement signed last year, Nigeria will pay $12.4 billion in exchange for a \ndebt cancellation of an estimated $18 billion, representing about 60% of the $30 billion Nigeria owed the Paris Club creditors. The agreement is the biggest debt relief deal for an African nation. \nNigeria, Africa's largest producer of oil, has used \"windfall\" earnings from the prevailing high oil prices in making these payments. \nThe Paris Club agreement was negotiated in October 2005, with the Nigerian delegation headed by Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, the minister of finance. The deal is part of the free-market reforms pursued by President Obasanjo. \nThe announcement comes in the wake of the endorsement of the reform programme by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which marks the last step for the debt relief deal to be completed. Nigeria is the first country to qualify for the IMF's Policy Support Instrument (PSI), which provides assessment and endorsement of a country's economic policy by the IMF, for those countries that do not require fund assistance. \nSpeaking before the commencement of the Federal Executive Council meeting at the Council Chambers, State House, President Obasanjo said, \"By Friday, April 21, we would have cleared ourselves of all debts owed to Paris Club.\" He also added, \"Considering the outstanding debts to the London Club and those owed internally, we are not out of the woods yet.\""}

One of the largest interactions (or \"inputs\") humans have with the atmosphere is the ever-increasing use of fossil fuels. Consumption has risen 2% per year for this decade.\nFossil fuels burnt in factories and automobiles send their waste into our atmosphere in two forms. The first is CO2 and other greenhouse gases, which have received substantial attention in the last few years because of the way they trap heat in the atmosphere. The second is the tiny particles of sulfur dioxide, soot and ash, which scientists call aerosols (basically smog). Research into understanding the negative health effects of air pollution has resulted in the development of catalytic converters for cars as well as devices to remove particulate solids from industrial waste before it reaches the air. \nMore recently, atmospheric scientists have come upon the phenomenon of the reduction of direct sunlight reaching Earth's surface\u2014 observing a nearly a 5% decline between 1960 and 1990, with evidence of a recovery since then. This has been dubbed the \"global dimming\" effect, and is probably due to the way these aerosols act upon clouds. It is important to realise that this does not represent a net loss of this much sunshine to the climate system - if so, large temperature declines would have been observed. Instead, the sunshine is absorbed elsewhere in the system, with a much smaller net loss.\nClouds form when moisture gathers around airborne particles, such as pollen or dust. Clouds formed by the aerosol particles emitted by fossil fuel consumption are made of many more tiny droplets than \"natural\" clouds. These smog-created clouds have two notable effects: they shield sunlight from reaching Earth's surface and, due to water's reflective nature, the millions of tiny droplets suspended in them reflect light back into space, allowing even less light to reach Earth.\nMany scientists now believe that global dimming caused by these pollutants has mitigated the temperature rises brought about by global warming. Over the last thirty years, Earth's temperature has increased by about 0.5 oC.\nIn the absence of global dimming, however, the Earth might be 0.3 oC warmer than it currently is, suggesting that a \"tug-of-war\" exists between greenhouse gases and particulates released by burning fossil fuels. Efforts to mitigate the human health dangers of smog have allowed more heat into our atmosphere and brought about a sharper increase in global warming.\nDr. James E. Hansen, professor at Columbia University and the head of the Goddard Institute for Space Studies , believes that if we continue on our current pattern, this warming could be as much as five degrees in the next thirty years and ten to fourteen degrees over the course of the century. Such a temperature rise would devastate life on Earth, likely bringing on a cascade of self-reinforcing warming effects. Earth's forests drying and burning, a steady thawing of the Greenland and arctic ice sheets, and, most dangerous of all, a release of the methane hydrates that are now frozen at the bottom of the oceans, could remake the planet into something inhospitable to human life. Dr. Hansen warns that, according to his research, man has just 10 years to reduce greenhouse gases before global warming and other responses to human activity by Earth's climate reach a \"tipping point\", becoming unstoppable.

The article prints as factual several false and historically inaccurate assertions by Reverend Patterson, a Native Hawaiian sovereignty activist, who seems to have taken a 112 year old joke seriously. \nThe direct falsehood reported as fact by Associated Press (not merely attributed to Reverend Patterson), and which Reverend Patterson uses as a basis for his April 30, 2006 \"national day of prayer for Hawaiian natives\", is as follows:\n\"...it was Cleveland as president who set aside April 30, 1894 as a day of prayer and repentance over the U.S. role in the Hawaiian monarchy's overthrow.\"\nThe fake proclamation attributed to President Grover Cleveland, was allegedly printed in the New York Sun February 26, 1894, and has been reported as real on several Hawaiian sovereignty websites; cited as real by Rev. Kaleo Patterson; and now reported as real by Associated Press in many newspapers.\nThe misunderstanding regarding this joke proclamation started with Helena G. Allen, in her book \"The Betrayal of Liliuokalani\", pp. 314-315, which provided the text of that proclamation. She did so in the context of discussing the constitution of the Republic of Hawai`i, despite the fact that the date on the proclamation was 4 months before a constitution was produced for the Republic of Hawaii. She wrote:\nHelena Allen cited its publication in the New York Sun, February 26, 1894. Allen does not say who arranged for the newspaper publication of this joke proclamation. She strongly implies it was Cleveland who actually authored the proclamation to show contempt for the revolutionary Hawai`i government headed by President Sanford B. Dole. \nBut that interpretation is doubtful for a number of reasons. As a joke, it hardly seems very funny for Cleveland to be calling an officer of the government of the United States (John Stevens) \"the devil.\" The description of the Provisional Government as a \"miserable herd of missionaries\" also doesn't come across as very humorous, since this was a government with which he had continuing diplomatic relations. The whole tone and tenor of the proclamation make President Cleveland seem emotional, irrational, insulting and arrogant.\nA more likely interpretation is that the joke was at the expense of President Cleveland -- his political opponents were poking fun at the zealousness of Grover Cleveland's continuing support for a deposed queen regarded by many as corrupt. The U.S. Senate Committee on Foreign Affairs published the Morgan Report the same day the joke proclamation was allegedly printed in the New York Sun. Washington politicians (including President Cleveland) had seen the Morgan Report beforehand, and knew the date it would be published. They knew the report would clear the U.S. of any wrongdoing in the overthrow of the monarchy, and support the legitimacy of the revolutionary Dole government. They knew the Morgan Report would severely criticize the royalist regime, and repudiate the Blount Report that Cleveland had orchestrated for the purpose of justifying his attempt to destabilize the Provisional Government and restore his friend Liliuokalani to the throne. Cleveland's enemies may have published the joke proclamation to poke fun at him.\nRegardless whether the joke proclamation was Cleveland's own expression of contempt for the Dole regime, or whether it was Cleveland's opponents' expression of contempt for the Cleveland regime -- either way, we know for sure that it was only a joke. The proclamation was never issued in any official way. It is not included in Cleveland's presidential messages and papers. The fake proclamation was apparently published in only one newspaper. \nPresident Grover Cleveland was a friend of Liliuokalani and was very aggressive in blocking annexation. During his first week in office he withdrew from the Senate a treaty of annexation proposed by the Hawai`i Provisional Government that had been approved by U.S. President Harrison; and he sent James Blount to Hawai`i. Blount went to Hawai`i, without Senate confirmation or even notification, as paramount minister plenipotentiary under secret orders. His actions while there seemed to imply a mission to destabilize the revolutionary government and to produce a report that would derail efforts in Congress to accept Hawai`i's offer of annexation. Blount took actions, which seemed to encourage a royalist counterrevolution, and wrote a report portraying the\noverthrow of the monarchy as planned and supported by the U.S. rather than by local revolutionaries. Blount intervened to sabotage negotiations whereby Liliuokalani offered Dole that she would give up all claims to land and political power in return for a lifetime annuity. After the submission of Blount's report, Minister Willis, Cleveland's representative to Hawai`i, ordered President Dole to step down and to put Liliuokalani back on the throne. \nBut despite all these things, after the U.S. Senate published the Morgan Report containing lengthy sworn testimony which repudiated the Blount Report, Cleveland changed his mind, gave formal diplomatic recognition to the Republic as the legitimate government of Hawai`i, and engaged in normal diplomatic negotiations with the Dole government on matters such as further implementation of treaties.\nAs much as political activists may want to believe Cleveland declared April 30, 1894 as a day of mourning for their cause, the reality is that Cleveland made no such statement, and in fact treated the Republic of Hawaii with dignity and respect after his initial impressions regarding the Hawaiian Revolution were shown to be in error.\nAfterword.\nFurther research into the citation of Helena G. Allen referring to the New York Sun, February 26, 1894, has yielded no such article as she mentions. It is possible her citation was incorrect on the date, so further research into the February 25th, 1894 and February 27, 1894 editions will be conducted. Unfortunately, Helena G. Allen died in 2003, so she is not available to answer questions about her citation."}

The price for crude oil continues to rise to new record highs ($75 per barrel of crude oil on NYMEX as of Friday's close). According to the results of a survey reported by the San Francisco Gate, in the 1st Quarter of 2006 investments in the clean technology sector has increased by 13% to $3.36 Billion in the US. In addition to attracting venture capital, clean technology companies are receiving a buzz from high profile investors.\nBill Gates, Founder of Microsoft, announced last week that his venture group (Cascade Investments) initiated the purchase of 25.5% ownership in Pacific Ethanol Inc. Pacific Ethanol is an ethanol production company that plans to expand operations by opening a new facility in California. Gates is not alone in high profile investments into the clean energy market, Bob Metcalfe (Founder of 3COM and Inventor of Ethernet), who acts as the managing partner of Polaris Ventures, announced the VC's first investment into the energy market. Polaris, which manages over $3 Billion in funds, invested $6.8 million into GreenFuel Technologies Corporation of Cambridge, MA. GreenFuel Technologies is an emissions to biofuels company, that utilizes natural algae in their patented bioreactors to turn greenhouse gas emissions from power plants into rich bio fuel. Polaris's investment into GreenFuel was part of the company's $18 Million Series B financing round that also included a high profile venture capital investor: Draper Fisher Jurvetson. When asked about the new industry venture, Bob Metcalfe said, \"Energy has got to be one of the top five problems the world faces, and it's been frustrating to watch activists and politicians fail to solve the problem...Now it's time for the entrepreneurs and scientists to give it a try.\" \nAccording to the International Energy Association, demand for renewable energy fuels will more than quadruple in the next decade. The current jump in oil prices is fueling investment into this relatively new market as investors view clean technology as an emerging opportunity rather than a public relations campaign. As gasoline prices continue to rise, alternative fuels become respectively cheaper and more attractive. In his latest State of the Union Address, President Bush outlined a plan to direct new investment into ethanol production and other clean technologies. According to a poll conducted by CBS News, Americans now see gas prices as one of their top three main concerns. With pressure coming from constituents, politicians are beginning to exert pressure on new spending on renewable technology to promote energy independence. Yet another front in this debate is that of environmental concern. With global warming on the rise, and many European governments eagerly searching for a Carbon Dioxide solution, the promise of reducing these emissions by 46% (as claimed by GreenFuel's bio reactor system) begins to resonate as a promising environmental and business opportunity."}

Giacalone has filed a lawsuit in New York Supreme Court against the city of Buffalo's Common Council and Planning board, alleging that the proposed Elmwood Village Hotel was approved \"without giving meaningful consideration to either the impact on the adjoining residential neighborhood, or the unique character of this section of Elmwood Avenue.\" Giacalone is representing Nancy Pollina and Patricia Morris, who operate the Don Apparel (a vintage clothing and collectibles shop at 1119 Elmwood Avenue), Angeline Genovese and Evelyn Bencinich, owners of residences on Granger Place which abut the rear of the proposed site, Nina Freudenheim, a resident of nearby Penhurst Park, and Sandra Girage, the owner of a two-family residence on Forest Avenue less than a hundred feet from the proposed hotel's sole entrance and exit driveway.\nThe Elmwood Village Hotel is a 72-room, seven-million-dollar hotel proposed by Savarino Construction Services Corporation and designed by architect Karl Frizlen of the Frizlen Group. Its construction would require the demolition of at least five buildings, currently at 1109-1121 Elmwood, which house several shops and residents. Although the properties are \"under contract,\" it is still not known whether Savarino Construction actually owns the buildings. It is believed that Hans Mobius, a resident of Clarence, New York and former Buffalo mayoral candidate, is still the owner. The hotel is expected to be a franchise of the Wyndham Hotels group.\nThe lawsuit, filed in State Supreme Court, is seeking annulment of the City of Buffalo's rezoning and site plan approvals for the hotel. \n\"Had the Common Council members complied with State law and waited to receive comments from the County's planning agency, they would have been obliged to address the County's concerns regarding the replacement of former residential buildings with 'a much larger commercial structure', the health effects of placing a 55-vehicle parking area next to existing homes, and the absence of a traffic study to assess the likelihood that the project would add 'considerable congestion' to the Elmwood/Forest intersection,\" said Giacalone.\n\"The four-story hotel will overshadow the neighboring homes and backyards, impacting quality of life and property values. Equally as important, the project will displace a unique and diverse group of businesses that have served nearby college students and Buffalo's arts and theater community for many years, and replace them with upscale retail establishments that will cater, not to local residents, but to affluent tourists and business travelers,\" added Giacalone.\nOn March 22, 2006 the city's Common Council approved the rezoning for the proposed hotel and on March 28, the Planning board approved the design and site plan of the hotel.\nThe lawsuit, entitled Pollina et al. v. Common Council of the City of Buffalo et al., [Index No. I-2006-3885], has been assigned to the Honorable Rose H. Sconiers, and is scheduled for oral argument at 9:30 A.M. on Thursday June 8, 2006."}

Its psychological effects include making users affectionate, giving them the impression of heightened senses in response to music, and overall euphoria. Physically the drug acts as a stimulant, a mild diuretic and causes hyperthermia, which is why, in combination with physical exertion leading to perspiration, users often drink large amounts of water to prevent dehydration.\nSerotonin is an important neurotransmitter, also known as 5-HT or 5-hydroxytryptamine, implicated in controlling mood. In fact, most well known anti-depressants, such as Paxil or Prozac, are believed to work by stabilizing the level of serotonin in the brain (SSRIs).\nEcstasy is believed to increase the levels of serotonin because of its effects on mood. Research in lab animals has provided evidence that it causes long-term post-use serotonin depletion. A common hypothesis among many researchers is that drop in serotonin levels below normal could be recognized by a corresponding decline in mood.\nSixty-four participants took part in the study. One half of the participants between the age of 18 to 45 were obtained by word of mouth or over the Internet. The other half consisted of controls that had no experience taking ecstasy, recruited from introductory psychology classes at the university. \nAccording to the study, participants filled out a questionnaire about their personal and drug use history. The personal history questionnaire queried the gender, age, psychiatric background, and current anti-depressant drug usage. Alternately, the drug history questionnaire explored the lifetime usage and usage habits of a wide variety of substances, including specific questions about abstinence from ecstasy and the most ecstasy taken by the participant in 12 hours.\nTwo tests were performed to assess psychiatric function: the Beck Depression Inventory-II(BDI-II) and the Shipley Institute of Living Scale(SILS) .\nThe BDI-II is a 21-question self-assessment that according to many sources is empirically valid for highlighting the presence and severity of depressive symptoms, and meets the requirements of the DSM-IV, which is the standard reference that mental health professionals use to diagnose psychological disorders.\nThe SILS is administered to assess cognitive abilities. It was developed in 1940 as a measure of general intellectual functioning, and is still administered in its original form.\nAccording to the study there was no significant difference in the BDI-II scores between the control and experimental groups. Furthermore, no significant correlation was found between any of the conditions of ecstasy use.\nThis study seems to go against the consensus that MDMA reduces serotonin levels and causes some measurable damage. However, there are other studies in the same journal that go into more detail about individual usage habits and harm reduction strategies that need to be considered alongside the data presented with this study. The study claims that when experimental groups are gathered via the Internet, they could be biased (more available information, taking less) and adopt different harm reduction strategies than average users. \nHowever, according to Professor David Nutt at University of Bristol, one could conclude Ecstasy causes less harm, and has less societal costs than alcohol."}

Maningrida \"certainly suffered extensive damage to some buildings and structures,\" she told the Sydney Morning Herald, although no serious injuries have been reported\nTropical Cyclone Monica now poses no risk to the Northern Territory of Australia. Monica was downgraded to a tropical low, but the cyclone has the potential regroup over the warm seas north of Australia. Monica could intensify back into a category two or even three cyclone before striking the north coast of Western Australia at the NT/WA border.\nCyclone Monica hit Australia just a month after category five Cyclone Larry tore through the community of Innisfail, about 100 km (60 miles) south of Cairns. Thousands of homes were destroyed by Cyclone Larry, with a damage bill expected to top A$1bn ($707m, \u00a3405m). \n\"A cyclone watch is current between the Daly Mouth River right through to the Kimberley\" says Ms Jenny Farlow, an NT forecaster.\nMeanwhile the cyclone has hampered government efforts to crack down on illegal fishing in the Gulf of Carpentaria. Rough seas combined with busy officers have grounded the effort to a halt, and three Indonesian fishing boats in Australian waters are reported to have gone unchecked."}

Its construction would require the demolition of at least five buildings, currently at 1109-1121 Elmwood, which house several shops and residents. Although the properties are \"under contract,\" it is still not known whether Savarino Construction actually owns the buildings. It is believed that Hans Mobius, a resident of Clarence, New York and former Buffalo mayoral candidate, is still the owner. The hotel is expected to be a franchise of the Wyndham Hotels group.\nAccording to official court documents, there are more defendants than previously thought. Documents state that not only Buffalo's Common Council and Planning Board are named in the lawsuit, but also the Mayor of Buffalo, Byron W. Brown, Savarino Construction Services Corporation, Hans J. Mobius and his son Hans S. Mobius owners of the properties at stake, Pano Georgiadis, owner of Pano's Restaurant on Elmwood, and Cendant Corporation, the parent company of Wyndham Hotels are also named in the suit.\nAccording to the lawsuit, during the length of the trial, Savarino Construction along with their employees, Hans Mobius and his son are not allowed to make any alterations or \"engage in the physical alteration\" of any of the said properties, 1109-1121 Elmwood and 9999 Forest. The suit also states that the owner of 605 Forest, Pano Georgiadis is also to follow the same rule.\nThe suit also states that Hans Mobius, his son and employees or \"agents\" are not allowed to \"take any step, lawful or otherwise, to terminate [the] petitioners, Nancy Pollina and Patricia Morris,\" owners of Don Apparel at 1119 Elmwood \"tenancies.\" Although the business is owned by Pollina and Morris, they are without a lease.\nWithin the suit it states that the rezoning of the properties 1119-1121 Elmwood and 605 Forest, by the Common Council, from a 'R3' Dwelling District to a C2 commercial zone \"constitutes as impermissible 'spot-zoning'\" and is \"not in accord with a well-considered plan for the development of the community and is null and void.\" According to the suit the courts of New York have defined spot-zoning as \"the process of singling out a small parcel of land for a use classification totally different from that of the surrounding area, for the benefit of the owner of such properties and to the detriment of other owners.\" The suit also states that the proposed site for the hotel is different from the surrounding properties because none of the zoning classifications, 'EB' [Elmwood Avenue Business District], 'R3' [Dwelling District], 'R1' [One Family District] and 'R2' [Dwelling District], permit the construction and operation of a hotel.\nIt is alleged that Savarino Construction \"failed to utilize forms obtainable from the city clerks office, failed to include an accurate map or survey showing the location of all buildings and structures and failed to include the names and addresses of each of the owners of the properties to be rezoned.\"\nIt is also believed that recommendation in regards to [hotel] compatibility, different land uses, traffic studies, community character, population density, relations between other residents and business owners, public convenience, governmental efficiency, and achieving and maintaining a satisfied community, were to be sent to Erie County's Planning agency and was to refer Savarino's rezoning application and site plan to the agency, however; the lawsuit alleges that although a referral was given to Savarino, it \"does not appear that the 'full statement of such proposed action' was forwarded to the County [Agency].\" \nThe suit also alleges that the Common Council \"failed to wait the 'statutorily-mandated' 30-days after the County's Planning Agency's receipt\" of recommendations from the Council. The County's Planning Agency replied to the recommendations, however; the Agency replied on March 27, 2006, just six days after the Council made its recommendations, falling well short of the \"statutorily-mandated\" thirty days. The Agency's reply however, did not support or oppose the recommendations or hotel proposal.\nPublic hearings are required to be registered by the City clerk to the City Planning Board, and according to the suit, \"no record\" of the Public hearing on March 7, presenting the initial proposal to the public, was made within the City's Clerk office or Planning Board.\nThe suit also alleges that the Common council and Planning Board also violated the State's Environmental Quality Review Act or SEQRA and the City's Environmental Review Ordinance by allowing the Planning Board to be the \"lead agency\" instead of the Common Council. A lead agency is an involved agency principally responsible for undertaking or approving an action and therefore responsible for determining whether an Environmental Impact Statement or EIS is needed, according to the SEQRA regulations. The suit also states that the hotel proposal \"constitutes an action under the SEQRA\" because the project could \"affect the environment by changing the use, appearance or condition of any natural resource or structure that requires one or more approvals from an agency or agencies\" and that the Common Council and Planning Board are \"obliged to comply with both the letter [recommendations] and spirit of the SEQRA review process\" which include identifying the areas of environmental concerns and taking a \"hard look\" at them. The suit also claims that the Common Council has the \"sole authority to grant Savarino Construction's rezoning request\" and \"to approve the special development plan,\" but it also claims that the Planning Board is \"an involved agency\" but that it is \"clearly subordinate to that of the Common Council\" therefore the decision made by both the Council and Planning Board to allow the Planning Board to be the 'lead agency,' is in \"violation\" of the State's SEQRA and \"renders all determinations\" made by the Planning Board and Common Council on March 14, 21, and 28, 2006, \"void and unauthorized.\" It goes on to say that the Council \"proceeded without or in excess of their jurisdiction, and/or made a determination in violation of lawful procedure, affected by an error of law, and/or in an arbitrary and capricious manner.\" It also states that unless the requirements of the SEQRA are met, then the petitioners have the right to \"seek a temporary restraining order\" from the Court if circumstances require it.\nThe suit also states that a failure to grant a preliminary injunction, through the courts, will result in \"irreparable injury\" to the petitioners and that the Council and Planing Board have failed to comply with the requirements of the SEQRA and have violated several other state laws and city codes.\nSo far, Savarino Construction has not responded to any calls or e-mails. District councilman Joseph Golombek also has not responded. Georgiadias was unavailable for comment.\nA preliminary hearing is scheduled to take place at 9:30 a.m. on June 8, 2006 in the Supreme Court building at 50 Delaware Avenue in Buffalo, on the 8th floor, part 31."}

The project is a cooperation between New York University's Center for Human Rights and Global Justice, Human Rights Watch and Human Rights First.\nThe human rights groups say they analyzed thousands of pages of government documents and conducted interviews with witnesses and prisoners who say they were abused by U.S. troops.\n\"Over 95 percent of those implicated were military personnel,\" said Hina Shamsi, a senior counsel for the group Human Rights First. \"The remainder were from the CIA or other intelligence agencies or were civilian contractors working either for the military or the CIA The cases involve over 1,000 acts of abuse, including homicide, assault, cruelty, maltreatment, maiming and sexual abuse.\"\n\"We found that abuses were pervasive, extending far beyond Abu Ghraib and that investigations have been incomplete and delayed, which has left a general failure of accountability,\" she said.\nIn the two years since the Abu Ghraib scandal surfaced, the human rights groups say 40 people have been sentenced to serve time in prison.

The card will also have a chip that will store a second photograph, address, date of birth, and details of children. Cardholders will be able to optionally include details of their next of kin, medical information and organ-donor status.\nAustralian Prime Minister John Howard says the card will replace 17 cards and vouchers used throughout Australia's health and welfare system. The card will be used to access unemployment benefits, pensions, healthcare rebates, childcare subsidies, veteran's entitlements and family tax benefits.\nMr Howard denied that the card was intended to be a stepping stone for a national identity card. He said that the card would not be compulsory and no person would be required to carry the card at all times.\nAustralians have never been keen on the idea of a national identity card. The idea for a national identity card first appeared in 1985 with a proposal for the Australia Card but was eventually given up upon, since then the idea has resurfaced on numerous occasions, most recently in 2002 after the London bombings. Mr Howard said his government had looked into a national identity card but the disadvantages outweighed the advantages.\nThe government hopes that the card will crack down on welfare fraud. The government estimates that it will cost $1 billion to implement the card and claims the card will save $3 billion over 10 years.\nThe Australian Labor Party, has cautiously welcomed the card, claiming to support it \"in principle\". The party's public accountability spokesman, Kelvin Thomson said that Labor will question if the card will be used to track people for national security purposes.\n\"Will this card be used for national security purposes and, if so, how?\" Mr Thomson said. \nPeter Hendy, chief of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry (a body representing businesses in Australia said that the card would be intrusive and increase operating costs for businesses.\nThe Australian Council for Civil Liberties has also expressed concerns.

This announcement came after the news of four Canadian soldiers killed by an improvised roadside bomb in Afghanistan. \nThe government has said that in the event of a Canadian soldier death, flags would fly at half-mast at the soldier's operational base, at their home base, and at the Defence Headquarters in Ottawa. The flag at Peace Tower will only be lowered to half-mast outside of the Remembrance Day in the case of the death of a former governor general, senator, prime minister, or an important public figure.\nThe mainstream media have mostly published articles which show the decision in a negative light. The Canadian newspaper The Chronicle-Herald carried a front page editorial on April 27 titled \"Lower flag as sign of respect\" which argued that the flag should be lowered \"out of respect for those killed in action\". The newspaper pledged to fly their own flag at half-mast whenever a Canadian soldier died in combat, and urged readers to do the same. Readers were also urged to write members of parliament to protest the government's decision.

It was based on interviews of more than 135,000 people.\nNationwide, the rate of underaged drinking remained basically unchanged, but in California, it rose from 15.28 percent of California children between 12 and 17-years-old who said they had consumed alcohol in the previous month in 2002, to 16.81 percent who said they had in 2004.\nBinge drinking, defined as drinking five or more drinks on the same occasion (i.e., at the same time or within a couple of hours of each other) on at least one day in the past 30 days, was reported by 10.27 percent of kids in 2004, up from the 9.16 percent who said they binged in 2002.\nThe report found that, in 2004, 10.9 percent of the nation\u2019s kids from the ages of 12 to 17 had used an illegal drug in the past month, down from 11.4 percent in 2002.\nIn California, the number of kids who said they had used an illicit drug in the past month rose, from 11.44 percent in 2002 to 12.05 percent in 2004.\nAmong California\u2019s 12- to 17-year-olds, those who said they had used marijuana in the previous month rose from 7.66 percent in 2002 to 8.52 percent in 2004. Those who had used marijuana in the past year rose from 14.11 percent to 14.6 percent over the period.\nOnly cocaine use was down among the age group, from 1.7 percent who said they had used it in the past year to 1.61 percent.\nThe use of any illicit drug, other than marijuana, in the month preceding the interviews of the 12- to 17-year-olds rose from 5.79 percent to 5.97 percent, according to the report. Nearly 8 percent of the age group in California had used pain relievers for \u201cnon-medical\u201d purposes, such as getting high, the survey reported, a topic not explored in the previous survey.\nMore than 9 percent of California kids from 12-17 said they were abusers of or dependent on alcohol or illicit drugs in the 2004 survey, up from just over 8 percent in 2002.\nTobacco use, including chewing tobacco, increased in the age group from 9.22 percent to 10.88 percent. Cigarette smoking rose from 7.48 percent to 8.69 percent. Fewer smokers, however, reported being at great risk of smoking a pack or more a day.\nThe report, State Estimates of Substance Use from the 2003-2004 National Surveys on Drug Use and Health, issued April 6, estimates state rates of use of illegal drugs, binge and underage drinking, serious mental illness and tobacco use. SAMHSA combined two years of data from the annual National Survey on Drug Use and Health to enhance the precision of estimates for the less populous states.\nThe report shows that California increased from 24.7 percent of 12 to 20 year olds using alcohol in the past month to 26.3 percent, while Wisconsin increased from 34.7 percent to 38.3 percent. Michigan and South Carolina, however, showed decreases in underage drinking from 31.8 percent to 30.2 percent for Michigan and from 27.3 percent to 24.1 percent for South Carolina.\nFor illegal drug use, six states registered decreases in current use among youth ages 12-17, Illinois, Nebraska, North Carolina, South Dakota, Vermont and Virginia. There were no statistically significant increases in current drug use among youth in any state, and there were no increases in either the 18-to-25 year old age group or the 26- and -older age group.\n\u201cWhile we are making progress on drug and tobacco use among youth, underage drinking continues as a stubbornly persistent problem,\u201d SAMHSA Administrator Charles Curie said. \u201cIt\u2019s time to change attitudes toward teen drinking from acceptance to abstinence. It begins by recognizing the importance of parents talking to their children early and often about alcohol, especially before they\u2019ve started drinking.\u201d\nThe estimates show that past month use of any illicit drug in 2003-2004 ranged from a low of 5.8 percent in Mississippi to a high of 11.8 percent in Alaska for all persons aged 12 and older. Four jurisdictions showed decreases from 2002-2003 in current use of any illicit drug: the District of Columbia, Florida, Nevada and Washington.\n\u201cState-by-state data is a powerful tool for policymakers at the federal, state and local levels to identify needs and target prevention and treatment resources. It is clear from the findings that illicit drug, alcohol and tobacco use varies substantially among states and regions. That is why we continue to work though innovative programs like Access to Recovery to increase the flexibility of federal funding available to states and communities,\u201d Curie said.\nMississippi and Utah had the lowest rate of past month marijuana use (4.2 percent) in 2003-2004 for population ages 12 and older, while Alaska had the highest rate (9.9 percent). Eight states were ranked in the top fifth nationally for past month marijuana use in all three age groups, 12 to 17, 18 to 25 and 26 and older. These states are Alaska, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Mexico, Oregon, Rhode Island and Vermont.\nSeven jurisdictions had decreases in past month use of marijuana between 2002-2003 and 2003-2004 for those ages 12 and older: Colorado, District of Columbia, Florida, Montana, Nevada, New Hampshire, and Washington.\nRhode Island had the highest percentage of persons aged 12 or older using cocaine in the past year, 3.5 percent. Ohio was the only state to show a decline in the use of cocaine in the past year, from 2.5 percent to 2.1 percent of persons aged 12 and older.\nIn the District of Columbia and Hawaii, approximately 3.1 percent of those 12 or older used narcotic pain relievers nonmedically, while 6.3 percent of those in Kentucky did. Washington and Kentucky were in the highest fifth for use of prescription pain relievers nonmedically in all three age groups. Arkansas and Maine had increases in the 12-17 age group, while California, Montana and New York had increases in nonmedical use of prescription pain medications among those ages 18 to 25. A decrease in nonmedical use of pain relievers was seen among those ages 12 and older in Hawaii (from 3.9 to 3.1 percent).\nEight states were in the top fifth for both underage use of alcohol and underage binge use of alcohol: Iowa, Massachusetts, Montana, New Hampshire, North Dakota, Rhode Island, South Dakota and Wisconsin.\nTobacco use in the past month by youth increased in California, but overall in California, tobacco use by those 12 and older fell from 22.5 percent to 20.7 percent due to a decrease among persons aged 26 and older. In Kansas, the percentage of persons aged 18-25 using tobacco in the past month increased from 45.7 percent to 49.9 percent.\nThe data show that West Virginia had the highest rate of serious psychological distress among persons aged 18 and older in the past year (12.7 percent) while Hawaii had the lowest rate (7.1 percent).

The President of Iran, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad stated,\"[Iran] won't back down one iota\". The US has called on Iran to stop its enrichment work and accuses Iran of trying to build a nuclear bomb. The US \"is leaving all options on the table\" not excluding military strikes with nuclear weapons or with conventional weapons in the eventuality of sanctions being ineffective. Iranian leaders have made strong statements against possible sanctions or military action against their country.

The railway will include sections at high altitude, crossing 5000 metre high mountains, long tunnels and lots of track laid on permafrost. The railway is being hailed in China as \"an engineering miracle\", but has attracted criticism from across the world over fears that the railway, the first to link it to outside the region, will increase Chinese control over the Tibetan autonomous region and will erode Tibetan culture and traditions.\nCurrently, Tibet can only be reached by air and by road. Departing from lower-altitude airports to fly into Tibet carries the risk of experiencing high altitude sickness, and the landing at Lhasa can be 'hair-raising'. Travelling by road means several days on a bus or hitchhiking on trucks over windy mountain roads. When the Quingzang Railway opens, it is expected that direct trains will run from Beijing and other cities.\nChina has long received criticism over its treatment of Tibet. The Tibet Autonomous Region excludes many areas claimed to be part of 'historic Tibet', and the former government of Tibet, headed by the Dalai Lama, now live in exile in India. China claims that the railway will bring greater freedoms and economic opportunities to the people of Tibet. For an area that has long been in relative isolation though, the railway is bound to have a profound effect. Locals may worry about what would happen to their trade if they were suddenly forced to compete with businesses from Mainland China. Much of Tibet is also ancient, with old buildings and traditional practices, which may be under threat from the new physical link with China.\nThere are also concerns from environmentalists. The passage between Tibet and China contains some unique flora and endangered animal species, such as Tibetan antelope, which may be threatened by the railroad. Construction of the railway will generate 7,000 tons of rubbish from 20,000 builders. Some of this rubbish will have been buried on the spot whilst some forms of non-degradable rubbish which may pollute water is said to have been transported to Golmud or Lhasa for treatment. A bridge is also said to have been built at Wudaoliang Basin to enable animals to cross. Once open the railway will generate more waste, and whilst the carriages are said to be enclosed, preventing passengers from throwing out rubbish, it remains to be seen what additional impact the running of the railway will create.\nAs well as passengers, the railway will also have a strong use in transporting freight, currently carried on trucks. This will mean that more coal and petroleum-based products will be brought into Tibet. Whilst China claims that this will enable Tibetans to stop logging pine trees for fuel, aiding the local ecology, the railway will accelerate Tibet's use of climate-damaging fossil fuels.\nSome Canadian student groups had called for a boycott of the group, who has a contract with China to provide some of the carriages.\nMost of the line is now complete, ahead of schedule. Signaling equipment is currently being installed, with trials said to begin in July. The railway is scheduled to open fully in 2007. Luxury carriages will carry tourists, with sleeping compartments and oxygen tanks to enable breathing within the high-altitude areas."}

The lawsuit, filed by Attorney Arthur J. Giacalone, was filed in New York State Supreme Court on April 21, 2006.\nThe Elmwood Village Hotel is a 72-room, seven-million-dollar hotel proposed by Savarino Construction Services Corporation and designed by architect Karl Frizlen of the Frizlen Group. Its construction would require the demolition of at least five buildings, currently at 1109-1121 Elmwood, which house several shops and residents. Although the properties are \"under contract,\" it is still not known whether Savarino Construction actually owns the buildings. It is believed that Hans Mobius, a resident of Clarence, New York and former Buffalo mayoral candidate, is still the owner. The hotel is expected to be a franchise of the Wyndham Hotels group. Buffalo's Common Council, Planning Board, Mayor of Buffalo, Byron W. Brown, Savarino Construction Services Corporation, Hans J. Mobius and his son Hans S. Mobius owners of the properties at stake, Pano Georgiadis, owner of Pano's Restaurant on Elmwood, and Cendant Corporation, the parent company of Wyndham Hotels are among those named in the suit.\nCouncilmember Joesph Golombek said that the Law Department is \"fighting the lawsuit because they believe that we did everything fairly and properly (as well as legally).\"\nGolombek also stated that the lawsuit \"could delay the start of the project\" and that if he were \"Mr. Savarino I would counter sue for any damages a postponement could bring.\"\n\"Except for the lawsuit the city is finished with the project. In my opinion I believe those opposed to the project are simply use to the city procrastinating on projects. This one was passed quickly by comparison. Thus part of their frustration.\" said Golombek.\n\"I understand the frustration of some of the people opposed to the project. But, in order for Elmwood to grow and thrive it will need to change. This change is a positive for that community,\" he added.\nGolombek also said that he is looking into \"helping the displaced businesses.\"\nAt least five businesses, Six Nations Gift Shop, Don Apparel, H.O.D. Tattoo, Skunk Tail Glass Company, and Mondo Video, will be forced to close their doors or relocate. Many of the buildings are also home to residents who will also have to move.\n\"I have personally contacted adjacent and nearby business associations and property owners to ask about the possibility of helping the displaced businesses. Hopefully the project will go through in a timely fashion and the displaced businesses will be able to relocate,\" said Golombek.\nA preliminary hearing is scheduled to take place at 9:30 a.m. on June 8, 2006 in the Supreme Court building at 50 Delaware Avenue in Buffalo, on the 8th floor, part 31."}

A thirty-four minute video containing an approximately twenty minute oration by Zarqawi, footage of him leading mujahideen in training on the battlefield and in a war room, and seated amongst local leaders of al-Anbar province. His speech touches upon a variety of topics, including the purportedly victorious and successful state of the mujahideen in Iraq, waging jihad in Iraq while steadying eyes on Jerusalem, and Usama bin Laden\u2019s proposed truce with the West. In fact, the video proper opens with an excerpt of a speech by bin Laden urging Muslim youth to jihad. On the refusal of the proposal, he warns U.S. President George W. Bush, his allies of the \u201cCrusaders, Shi\u2019ites and the converters\u201d that they will never enjoy life as long as blood courses through the veins of the mujahideen.\nZarqawi also speaks of the alleged lies of the administration and the true state of the American soldier in Iraq. He states: \u201cWhy don't you tell about the reality of your soldiers and their failure to fight...why don't you tell your people about the soldiers who commit suicide, why don't you tell your people that your soldiers can not have any sleep without taking drugs which makes them like animals\u2026 and they are driven by your generals, who are like the Crusaders and evangelists, to the slaughterhouse.\u201d He also condemns the Iraqi political process, and those who speak falsely of being one of the mujahideen, trying to convince Muslims that the government is an attempt to apply Shari\u2019a law.\nConcerning the Mujahideen Shura Council, which appeared on the Iraqi land following the seeming disappearance of Zarqawi, he admits to \u201cbeing one of them\u201d and continues to hold title as the Emir of al-Qaeda in Iraq, part of the umbrella for the mujahideen in that state. \u201cThey all stretch their hands and stand on the same line,\u201d Zarqawi argues. Other portions of the video show Zarqawi inspecting local areas, using a rocket with a range of 50 kilometers, and a final image of him firing an automatic weapon, and stating: \u201cAmerican will go out of Iraq, humiliated, defeated.\u201d \nA Full transcript of the video has been provided below:\nIn the name of Allah the most Gracious the most Merciful\nMujahedeen Shura Council of Iraq\nThen fight in Allah's cause thou are held responsible only for thyself and rouse the believers. It may be that Allah will restrain the fury of the disbelievers; for Allah is the strongest in might and in punishment (Alnisa\u2019a:84)\nO\u2019 Banner\u2019s holders stand,\nWhere are the lions of Anbar?\nWhere are the lions of Salah Aldeen?\nWhere are Baghdad\u2019s men?\nWhere are the knights of Ninawah and the champions of Dyalah?\nWhere are the courageous of Kurdustan?\nWhere are you the lions of Monotheism?\nBe fully aware of the apostate media sources.\nI swear by Allah, that they have nothing with us except the sharp swords, and between them and us will only be the frightened nights.\nI swear by Allah that America will be defeated in Iraq.\n(Field commander is talking):\nAs for the developing and manufacturing, the brothers, by the grace of Allah have developed and improved two missiles in Alanbar province in particular.\n(When missile was fired):\nAgainst the make ready your strength to the utmost of your power, including steeds of war, to strike terror into (the hearts of) the enemies, of Allah and your enemies, and others besides, whom ye may not know, but whom Allah doth know. (Alanfal:60)\nA message for Mankind\nI focus this call to the young men of Islam; gather together in fighting the crusades and the Jews, and remember Allah at all times repeatedly, by Allah, it\u2019s either victory or martyrdom. No one will surpass his fate, and he who ever turns out to be a martyr, his sole will freely be flying around the paradise as it wishes, close to the throne of Allah; what a great difference between being near his family and/or near his lord.\nO\u2019 young men of Islam every where, especially those near the battles, where the obligation is further; O\u2019 young men in Aljazeera, Egypt, and Sham; O\u2019 siblings of Salah Aldeen, O\u2019 knights of Mohammad Alfateh, continue your support to your brothers in Iraq, whereby the gravest of the wars is continues, and its fire is on the rise, the crusades have invaded them, killed thousands of them, and abducted thousands, whishing to eliminate them. And they are instead, by the grace of Allah, fighting the crusades patiently, giving up all they\u2019ve got for the sake of Allah and in order to defend themselves. May Allah be with them and those who support them.\nAll praise be to Allah granting might to his religion with his victory, lowering the infidels with his supremacy. Sorting circumstances by his order; Plotting for the disbelievers with his arrangement; He who alternated the days with his divine justice.\nAnd peace be upon who Allah raised the minaret of Islam with his sword.\nMy treasured nation,\nI am conversing to you not with falsehoods, hoping to find with you open ears and prudent hearts, for the honest man does not deceive his family.\nThe crusade enemy, when invaded Iraq, meant to control this nation and reinforce the Zionist state, from the Nile to the Euphrates. However, Allah granted your sons the Mujahedeen by standing firm before the strongest crusaders attack to the Islamic land.\nThey stood strong against this attack for over three years, disbursing their soles and their wealth. They stood against this massive military, media, and economical attack not for anything except to defend you, your religion, your sons, and your honor.\nAllah dispersed the enemies\u2019 gathering and their defeat became clearer to who ever has eyesight and prudent heart.\nHere are your sons, by the grace of Allah, indulging into one battle after another, and attack after attack; they by the will of Allah hold the upper hand in the battle field now.\nIf it wasn\u2019t for the continuous and ongoing media muting, you would\u2019ve seen the astonishing. By Allah it\u2019s the championships and the victories coming to us, and you my nation should thank Allah for this great bounty, that Allah prepared a group of your sons the Mujahedeen defending you and protecting your honor, otherwise the Sunnah in Iraq would\u2019ve been in between a revulsion crusade and a betraying Shiite. And the women of the Sunnah would\u2019ve been on the laps of the revulsion crusades and the betraying Shiites; Abu Ghraib and the interior ministry jails remain memorable.\nMy treasured nation,\nWe are in Iraq a stone throw from the Masjed Alaqsa, we fight in Iraq and our eyes are on Alqsa which will never be freed except with a guiding Quraan and a prevailing sword; \u201cbut enough is thy Lord to guide and to help\u201d (Alforqan:31)\nThe history and experience had showed that you have no one after Allah except your Mujahedeen sons; they are your protection, your strong shield, and your beating heart. They become happy to your happiness and sad to your sadness; they stay up all night for your protection and have jealousy for you. Their hearts burst in sorrow for your state, and their tongues never stop chanting: O\u2019 Allah elevate the state of humiliation and defeat away from my nation, O\u2019 Allah bring back victory to my nation.\nAs for the American administration, and to its chairman the cross banner\u2019s holder Bush, we say to him and to whoever is swimming in his space from the Jews and the crusades and form the Shiites and others, we say that you will never be safe in the Islamic land, and by Allah you will never feel secured so long we still have a beating nerve and a moving eyelash.\nPreviously, our leader Osama Bin Laden may Allah protect him, had offered you a long truce. It could\u2019ve been better for you and those who are with you if you\u2019d have accepted, but your arrogance pushed you to refuse. Here you are today, running from east to west trying to find solutions \u201cwill not stand except as stands one whom the evil one by his touch hath driven to madness\u201d (Albaqarah:275). You turned to be a grave liar, betraying your own people that everything is under control, and then soon everyone finds out about your lies and so on. You became like the one who\u2019s treating himself from alcohol by alcohol. You were never at any time truthful with yourself or your people, although it\u2019s found some truth in your great grandparents you are fully detached from.\nWhy don\u2019t you show the truth about your soldiers and their inferior state of struggle?\nWhy don\u2019t you tell your people about the continuous suicides amongst your soldiers?\nWhy don\u2019t you tell your people that your soldiers can never go to sleep unless they take the hallucinating and drugging pills? So they become like cattle driven by your war generals, the Neozionists, to the killing fate.\nWhy don\u2019t you tell your people about the congregational escape and the defiance among your troops?\nListen you grave liar and insolent one; your dreams will never come true, our blood and bodies are between you and your imaginings. And what is coming your way is much greater than what passed by the will of Allah.\nThe game of rotten democracy that you brought to Iraq, after you gave hope to people about freedom, happiness, and the economical/personal security; all of these lies went with the winds and will never come back by the will of Allah.\nThere we see you today, trying with all what you got to bring together the clusters, the parties, the partners from your tails to bring about a handicapped government that it might pull you out from your crucial pitfall.\nWe believe that any government you place in Iraq, whether be it from the betrayal Shiites or Zionist Kurds, or your tails from the Sunnah; it will only be an apostate government that will aid the crusades, and it came only to be a poisoned dagger stabbed in the heart of the Islamic Nation.\nAmerica learned today that its planes, tanks, momentous troops, and its tails from the Shiites army will never be able to finalize the battle with Mujahedeen. Therefore, it\u2019s trying to surround the Jehad by pushing its tails from those who are counted to Sunnah, those who accepted to play the role and be a rope that tightens around the Sunnah\u2019s necks and pull the Americans from their defeat. They used those who use the Islamic slogans as a mask to spread their masters\u2019 propaganda on the importance of organizing the military and the police, and confuse the Muslims with their mixed messages injecting poison in honey, forgetting intentionally or not that every occupier throughout history used a cover up face from the occupied to use them in order to establish a solid base and embezzle the wealth of the country and its people.\nAllah has said: \u201cAnd he amongst you that turns to them (for friendship) is of them\u201d (5:51)\nThat is by constituting for this life and the hereafter.\nAnd Allah has said: \u201cfor Pharaoh and Haman and (all) their hosts were Men of sin\u201d (28:8)\nTherefore, we repeat our warning to whoever is trying to reorganize and spread the military and the police forces, which was established only to be a tool for the occupier in their bigger plan, and to implement laws other than the law of Allah.\nBe extremely aware, those who join these apostate forces have nothing with us except the sharp swords, and between them and us will be nothing except grave days and nights.\nAllah has said;\u201d Those who believe fight in the cause of Allah, and those who reject faith fight in the cause of evil: so fight ye against the friends of Satan: feeble indeed is the cunning of Satan\u201d (4:76)\nHaving said the previous, and having mentioned the defeat of the enemy and his paraphernalia. The enemy is trying today to seduce two kinds of people to the alleged parliamentary game to harvest the fruits of the Mujahedeen whom only trying to make the word of Allah prevails.\nThe first kind of which is the one trying to attach oneself with the Mujahedeen, although they never lived the Mujahedeen life nor they ever supported them at the occupation time. The second of which is those who had at the beginning the honor of fighting the crusades, however what counts is the end; their efforts won\u2019t be accepted by the law of Islam unless they strive with action to make the word of Allah prevails, using what Allah lawfully guided us with, the clean means, not by using evil parliaments striving to have the word of Allah mixed with other man made constitutions and laws. The aim does not justify the means here.\nAlthough these two kinds, and whoever follows their footsteps, allege that they are trying with these parliaments to implement the law of Allah. However, the actions and the historical experiences oppose their myth. Anyone that is following the political map in Iraq knows that the majority of the parliaments\u2019 members are from the Shiites and the atheists of Kurds and Sunnah, not to mention those of the mixed motion believes. Therefore, the heavy side in the balance of the parliaments will always be in the hand of evil.\nAllah has said: \u201cbeware of them lest they beguile thee from any of that (teaching) which Allah hath sent down to thee\u201d (5:49)\nAnd Allah has said: \u201cFast thou not turned thy vision to those who declare that they believe in the revelations that have come to thee and to those before thee? their (real) wish is to resort together for judgment (in their disputes) to the evil one, though they were ordered to reject him but Satan's wish is to lead them astray far away (from the right\u201d (4:60)\nAs for you patient truthful Mujahedeen, may Allah accept from you and us the best of deeds, and may Allah bless your Jehad. You were able by the will of Allah and his support to stop this crusades\u2019 attack and you\u2019ve bounded him with injuries. Thus, continue your Jehad and operations, and elevate your hits, it\u2019s only the sign of victory and it\u2019s the last breath of the cross worshipers in the land of two rivers. The low fighting self-esteem of the crusades\u2019 soldiers is an only obvious sign in Iraq. Therefore, renew your intentions, and correct yourselves, and carry on together against your enemy. Your enemy is uncovered, by the will of Allah, weakened, unprotected, and broken in pieces. Do not give him a chance to take its breath, continue your stabbings one after the other, O\u2019 Banner\u2019s holders stand,\nWhere\u2019s are the lions of Anbar?\nWhere are the lions of Salah Aldeen?\nWhere are Baghdad\u2019s men?\nWhere are the knights of Ninawah and the champions of Dyalah?\nWhere are the courageous of Kurdustan?\nWhere are you the lions of Monotheism?\nO\u2019 siblings of Khaled and Muthananh, Saad and Meqdad and Salah Aldeen.\nWhere are the immigrants? Where are the supporters?\nWhere are the people of Surat Altawbah and Alanfal?\nWhere are the people of Alfath and Alqital?\nO\u2019 leaders of this nation; who is for the crying women, who is for the jailed dignified women, who is for the purified women in the jails of the Shiites.\nO\u2019 Allah, there is no life except the life of the hereafter, O\u2019 Allah grant victory to immigrants and their supporters.\nBe very aware from the embezzlers, with their masters the crusades, trying to surround you. Be aware and extremely aware from putting down your weapons, and then you will harvest nothing but the defeat, beat and crush in this life and the hereafter.\nYou were always supplicating to Allah day and night to ease the way for you to join the Jehad in Afghanistan and Chechnya or other places. After that, Allah chose you for the trade of Jehad at your own land, and opened for you the doors of paradise. Be extremely aware of closing these blessed doors, be aware \u201cAnd be not like a woman who breaks into untwisted strands the yarn which she has spun, after it has become strong\u201d(16:92)\nDo not let the trade of Jehad depart your land; otherwise you will be disgraced and you\u2019ll be only ruled by the scum; \u201cthey set you hard tasks and punishments, slaughtered your sons and let your women folk live\u201d (2:49)\n\u201cIf ye turn back (from the Path), He will substitute in your stead another people; then they would not be like you\u201d (47:38)\nFinally, I glad tied the nation by establishing the Mujahedeen Shura Council of Iraq, which will be by the grace and will of Allah as the kernel for the establishment of an Islamic State, in which, the word of Allah prevails. All praise be to Allah, the efforts are being joined, and the hands are being extended and shaken for the obedience of Allah and his messenger and the Jehad in the cause of Allah. And this Council will be, by the will of Allah, an umbrella for every truthful Mujahed. I am honored to be one member of this blessed Council under its blessed leadership. At the same time remaining the Ameer (leader) of the Alqaeda Organization in the land of two rivers (Iraq).\nThe servant of Jehad and Mujahedeen, glorifying Allah, your brother Abu Musaab Alzarqawi.\nFriday, 23 Rabii Awal 1427,\nApril 21, 2006.\nAll praise be to Allah.\nIn the name of Allah the most gracious the most merciful, and peace be upon our prophet Muhammad his family and companions.\nI welcome our beloved sheikh in the land of Anbar, the land of Jehad. And we ask Allah to keep it a thorn in the eyes of the disbelievers.\nI would like to inform about the great victory in the battles of Ramadi, killing many of the disbelievers and taking over the center and headquarter of the infidels.\nTaking over the city for several days, preventing the crusades from even coming near it.\nAnd this operation was a clear message against the visit by the infidels\u2019 ambassadors ( Rice and Straw).\nIn general, the self esteem of the Mujahedeen is high, in opposite to the infidels whom are always in continuous deterioration.\nAs for the developing and manufacturing, the brothers, by the grace of Allah have developed and improved two missiles in Alanbar province in particular, that will be used soon, one has the ability to travel 40km with a 50kg warhead, here\u2019s a picture of it\u2026\nThen fight in Allah's cause thou are held responsible only for thyself and rouse the believers. It may be that Allah will restrain the fury of the disbelievers; for Allah is the strongest in might and in punishment (Alnisa\u2019a:84)\nAnd the other is anti armored vehicles, is carried on the shoulder and has been internally modified to penetrate armored vehicles, and here\u2019s a picture of it.\n\u201cIt is part of the mercy of Allah that dost deal gently with them. Wert thou severe or harsh hearted, they would have broken away from about thee: so pass over (their faults), and ask for (Allah\\'s) forgiveness them in affairs (of moment). Then when thou hast taken a decision, put thy trust in Allah. For Allah loves those who put their trust (in him\u201d (3:159)\nIf Allah helps you, non can overcome you: if he forsakes you, who is there, after that, that can help you? in God, then, let believers put their trust (3:160)\nSheikh Ayman Alzahahre\u2019s voice:\nO\u2019 Islamic Nation, the turf of Iraq now is the most dangerous field of Jehad in this century. Therefore, the nation must support the courageous Mujahedeen that are fighting in the very forefront defending the honor of Islam and its dignity.\nSheikh Abu Musaab: by Allah, American will be defeated in Iraq, by the will of Allah, and it\u2019ll leave Iraq humiliated, crushed, and defeated by the will of Allah.\n "}

The cap price would continue to be calculated, but the governor would have sole discretion to reinstate the price cap. The bill would also call for increased reporting of profits by oil companies.\nThe bill draft still needs majority approval by both houses (which appears likely), and signature by Governor Linda Lingle.\nThe current law uses wholesale gasoline prices from three Mainland markets to set the maximum price that oil companies can charge for gasoline. Retailers are free to charge whatever they wish. \nThe law was proposed by the Democratic-controlled legislature during a time when oil company profits in Hawaii compared with the Mainland came under intense scrutiny. Republicans, including Lingle, opposed the bill.\nSince the law went into effect in September 2005, price fluctuations due to the disruption of gasoline supply in the wake of Hurrican Katrina have resulted in gas prices of more than $3.00 a gallon in Honolulu, with significantly higher prices on the Neighbor Islands. Currently prices of unleaded gasoline in Honolulu range from $3.00 to $3.42 per gallon, the highest in the nation. \nDuring the current legislative session which expires Thursday, the House of Representatives (the lower house) passed a version calling for outright repeal of the law, while the Senate (the upper house) called for modification of the formula used to calculate the cap.\nHowever, in recent weeks, the main proponent of the gasoline price cap law, Senator Ron Menor (D-Mililani), softened his position, allowing for an indefinite suspension of the gas cap. Negotiations between the House and Senate had reached an impasse over the calculation of the cap level. Senate negotiators pushed for a formula that would have set cap levels about 15 to 20 cents lower than the current formula. The leadership of the legislature intervened as the deadline for conference committee reports loomed.\nHawaii is the only state in the United States to institute price controls on gasoline in recent years."}

Suryanarayana was apparently killed while he was trying to escape a few hours ago. The Indian Prime Minister Dr. Manmohan Singh has condemned the beheading, calling it an \"inhuman act\". Indian security forces are enroute to Afghanistan to investigate the matter and the Indian Foreign Secretary Mr. Shyam Saran has said that India will do whatever it takes to bring the perpetrators of this brutal murder to justice.

Some of the accused have been held in solitary confinement for 6 months up to and during their trial.\nThe group Civil Rights Defence organised the event with family members of the accused and news reporters as a peaceful protest. A small group of about 15 police officers awaited the arrival of the group. The police said that their main concern was the health and safety of everyone as the protest was being held next to a busy road. Officers only approached when the Country Fire Authority was summoned by a passerby to put out an open camp fire, as there was fire restriction in effect in the area. The fire fighters were met with laughter and sarcastic applause. Enclosed fires and barbeques were considered acceptable.\nThe men being held are Nacer Benbirka, Shane Gregory Kent, Aiman Joud, Fadl Sayadi, Hany Taha, Amer Haddara Izzydeen Atik, Abdullah Meri, Shoue Hammoud, Bassem Raad, Ezzit Raad, Ahmed Raad and Majed Raad. \nIn a statement read at the protest, one of the accused and his wife (Eman Abdou and Shane Kent) said they were upset at the Australian media for participating in lying to the Australian public and the government for the way they have treated the accused. \n\"I believe the conditions out at the Barwon Prison Acacua Unit are oppressive and inhumane. Furthermore I am upset at the Australian media for participating in lying to the Australian public. These men have a right to a fair trial, and everyone is innocent until proven guilty,\" the statement read.\nThe statement also went on say that the limited legal visits were often shortened and that the best treated accused are in solitary confinement for 18 hours a day while some are in solitary confinement consistently. Omar Mehri, the brother of one of the accused spoke at the day's event and talked about verbal harassment and hate mail he and his family have received. He also talked of his brother being amazed to see grass after 5 months.\nSpeakers at the event said the current laws used to prosecute murderers and other criminals should be used to prosecute terrorist suspects and had the same sentiments as Eman Abdou and Shane Kent. They said the laws were unjust and the treatment of the accused was cruel and unusual, constituting torture under the terms of the UN charter. \nOmar Merhi, brother of one of the detained said in a statement \"My brother and the other arrested men are confused and want to know why they are in Australia's highest security unit for simply practising their religion.\"\nExternal links.\nCivil Rights Defence\nSources.\n "}

Saturday is typically the busiest day of the show, with many events taking place in the ring.\nPolice and St. John Ambulance personnel who were already present at the show arrived almost immediately and began providing assistance. After assessing the incident, additional police, rescue, ambulance and fire personnel were deployed.\nThose injured range in age from five to 71 years. The most severe of the injuries were sustained by a 71 year-old man who suffered head injuries and a five year old boy from a neighbouring city who suffered both head and severe leg injuries. Both have been airlifted to Westmead Hospital in Sydney and are described as being in a critical condition.\nOther injured people were taken to both Bathurst and Orange Base Hospitals.\nThe driver of the vehicle was taken to hospital suffering from shock.\nPolice are investigating the incident, have seized the involved car, and questioned witnesses.\n Many local citizens have been warning about pedestrian safety for show patrons for a number of years. Their concerns were not about the showground itself, but the fact that patrons have to cross a highway carrying 27,000 vehicles per day unassisted to get from the main parking area to the showground. Following Saturday's incident, the local council has hired crossing guards to help those crossing the highway."}

In his double-act with Bridges, Bush sent up his reputation for delivering nonsense lines and making verbal gaffes (for which the word \" has been coined).\nBush talked about spreading his agenda \"globally and around the world, as well as internationally\", whilst Bridges, who delivered many of the more cutting lines, said, \"How come I can't have dinner with the 36 percent of the people who like me?\" The President's pronunciation of the word \"nuclear\" and Dick Cheney's hunting accident were also mocked.\nThe primary source for edgy political humor that Saturday night, however, occurred when rising star of \"\", , assumed the helm as critic.

The Planetarium used to be an attraction in its own right, but in recent years has become simply a feature tacked onto the end of the waxworks tour, the original 45 minute show cut down to just over 10 minutes. The planetarium will be renamed 'The Auditorium' and will feature a show that \"gets to the heart of celebrity\", being produced in collaboration with animation house Aardman Productions.\nFamous astronomer Sir Patrick Moore has called the decision \"most regrettable\", and many have commented that the change from space to celebrity is an unfortunate sign of our times.\nTo say 'farewell' to the planetarium, Tussauds have allowed free entry in its penultimate week, from 24th - 30th April. Visitors could enter through the group admissions entrance to see the show, running every twenty minutes. Unlike the queues for Madame Tussauds, which typically run right up the street, few people waited to see the planetarium show, even on the Saturday. The show, titled \"Journey to Infinity\", was projected onto the inside of the dome using Digistar 3 digital projectors. It told the story of space, starting from Earth and zooming out to reveal the other planets in the Solar System, the Milky Way, the other galaxies and the rest of the universe. It ended with an optimistic message suggesting that humans would continue to explore space, going further than ever before.\nThe London Planetarium opened in 1958 on the site of an old cinema that was destroyed in the second world war. Evening laser performances called 'Laserium' were held between 1977 and 1990. A \u00a34.5 million redevelopment saw it relaunch in 1995 with a new 'Digistar II' monochromatic 3D projection system. This was upgraded to the full-colour 'Digistar 3' system in 2004 which is currently in use.\nThe planetarium at the also famous Royal Observatory in Greenwich has also been closed since September 2004, however this is due to re-open in 2007 having received a \u00a315 million redevelopment programme. It will be three times the size of the old planetarium, and has received backing from Astronomer Royal Sir Martin Rees, and the Astronomer Royal for Scotland, Professor John Brown."}

Ethan has also founded Global Voices Online and helped found Tripod.com, the free web-hosting company now owned by Lycos. He serves a fellow at the Berkman Center for Internet and Society. Tripod. \nThe interview was held publicly in a dedicated IRC channel.\nI got interested in Geekcorps because I'd lived in Ghana as a student in 1993 and 1994\nWhile over there, I was amazed at just how little internet connectivity was available\nI did a bit of volunteer work helping wire an environmental organization, but basically the only people who had regular net access were US embassy employees.\nSo I was fascinated to learn that my friends in Ghana were getting online in the late 1990s, and I wondered whether anyone would start building net-based businesses, as people were doing in the US\nMy wife and I went back to Ghana to visit friends and found that there was a huge deal of enthusiasm about the web and the potential it represented, but almost no expertise\npeople were really desperate to learn, but very few people were able to teach at the same time, I was ready to step down from Tripod, and I knew a lot of burned out geeks\nI started wondering whether some of my friends would be interested in sharing their skills in the developing world and whether that would be a useful thing to do\nlots of international development folks seemed to think it was a good cause, so I started working on it fulltime.\nWe ended up sending about 100 people overseas over the four years I was involved with the project\nwe usually sent about 6-8 to a country at a time, working with a variety of businesses, NGOs and government agencies biggest projects were in Ghana, Mali, Mongolia, Senegal.\nBasically, I'm concerned about the ability of people all over the world to make a good living, send their children to school, build nice houses, have enough food and clean water, etc there's clearly something of a tradeoff offered by all sorts of globalization - as millions of Chinese are lifted out of rural povery, industrial manufacturing jobs in the US disappear but the US has a pretty good history of innovating and creating new jobs in fields that require a lot of intellectual endeavor the US continues to found interesting software companies, pioneer new net services and generally do a lot of the interesting development on the cutting edge of tech I think a lot of routine coding jobs are up for outsourcing, but I don't think that people who design software - or who manage the outsourcing and software development process - are going away any time soon it's very hard to outsource creative activities - it's somewhat easier to outsource repetitive processes.\nI think we need to worry less about individual job loss and more about the ability to continue creating new projects. at the same time, I'm very excited to see companies in the developing world moving up the value chain as well, starting to innovate and create new projects as well...\nThey're very different projects and communities, WC is a magazine -it's a chance for a small group of smart people to write original content on green issues it's a lot less global than GV - perhaps overly focused on the US and Europe - and has a tight subject focus GV is an edited aggregator People are not so much writing original, opinionated content on GV as they are linking to other content indeed, we ask people to try very hard not to be especially opinionated on GV. Not NPOV, but a similar perspective - you point, you don't advocate\n&lt;ethanz&gt; also GVO is huge - 10 regional editors, about 60 regular contributors, a network of about a thousand blogs we regularly link to the community has a very different feeling - much more international, more 24/7. both are fascinating projects, successes in their own ways, but quite different on the tech issues, a little - in both cases, we're taking very simple weblog tools and asking them to support very large communities. And a little bit on the issue of how they interface with mainstream media in both cases, we're interested in amplifying memes and getting them picked up by popular press as well as on the web.\nBlogs are essentially about opinion, asking for NPOV in the blog space misses the point - we want to know what opinions people in Syria have but we want our middle east editor to try to fairly represent the different opinions taking place in that space that said, he's got an opinion as well so asking for NPOV isn't the right thing to do - asking him to point to a diversity of opinions is, in our case\nGeekcorps can be found online at www.geekcorps.org and Global Voices Online is at www.globalvoicesonline.org."}

Clinton Foundation, means that the nation's biggest beverage distributors, Coca Cola Co., Pepsico, Cadbury Schweppes PLC, and the American Beverage Association, will pull their soda products from vending machines and cafeterias in schools serving about 35 million students, according to the Alliance for a Healthier Generation, a joint initiative between the Clinton Foundation and the American Heart Association.\n\"This is an important announcement and a bold step forward in the struggle to help America's kids live healthier lives,\" said Bill Clinton, according to a press release from the foundation. \"These industry leaders recognize that childhood obesity is a problem and have stepped up to help solve it. I commend them for being here today and for taking this important step. There is a lot of work to be done to turn this problem around but this is a big step in the right direction and it will help improve the diet of millions of students across the country.\"\nUnder the agreement, high schools will still be able to purchase drinks such as diet and unsweetened teas, diet sodas, sports drinks, flavored water, seltzer, and low-calorie sports drinks for resale to students.\nThe companies plan to stop soda sales at 75 percent of the nation's public schools by the 2008-2009 school year, and at all schools in the following school year. The speed of the changes will depend in part on school districts' willingness to change their contracts with the beverage distributors, the release said.\nCalifornia had already banned soda sales at Logan and other state high schools, starting in July 2007, under a bill signed by Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger. \"California is facing an obesity epidemic,\" he said at the time. He said he plans for the ban to be the first step in creating a healthier California.\nThe bill banning soda sales, SB965, was introduced last September by Senator Martha Escutia of State Senate District 30 in Southern California. SB965 is one of several bills signed into law to \"eliminate junk food and soda from campuses, and to increase the amount of fresh fruits and vegetables available to students,\" said Schwarzenegger. The new law will go into full effect by July 1, 2007.\nState law already bans soda sales at the lower grade levels.\nElsie Lee Szeto, the director of Food and Nutrition Services of New Haven Unified School District in Union City, California, said that, under the new law, no less than 50 percent of all beverages sold to students between a half hour before school begins and a half-hour after school will have to meet specific criteria that include alternatives like fruit based drinks that are comprised of no less than 50 percent fruit juice and have no added sweeteners. All milk sold will be two percent fat milk, soy milk, and other similar non-dairy milk.\nAbout 16 percent of our nation's children and adolescents are overweight or obese \u2013 nearly four times more than forty years ago, according to the Alliance for a Healthier Generation.\nAccording to the Center of Science in the Public Interest (CSPI), a non-profit advocacy group in Washington D.C., two out of three teenagers in California drink soda everyday. The average intake for males 13 to 18 is three or more cans of soda a day.\nA recent study by researchers of Children's Hospital Boston showed a connection between consumption of sugary drinks and childhood obesity.\nChildren's Hospital Boston's Cara Ebbeling, PhD, and David Ludwig, MD, PhD, led a controlled trial for 103 children ages 13 to 18. Half of the teens, picked randomly, were sent non-caloric beverages of their choosing. The remaining teens were asked to continue their regular eating and drinking habits as a control group.\nAfter six months, the group that had received the calorie-free drink deliveries had an 82 percent decrease in the consumption of sugary drinks, while the control group continued unaffected. The body mass index of the drink delivery group decreased, while the control group had a slight increase. Other factors such as exercising and television viewing did not change in either group.\nEbbeling concluded that one 12-oz sugary drink every day converted to a one pound weight gain over 3 to 4 weeks. \"It should be relatively simple to translate this intervention into a pragmatic public health approach. For example, schools could make non-caloric beverages available to students by purchasing large quantities at low costs,\" she said.\nThe agreement announced today \"is really the beginning of a major effort to modify childhood obesity at the level of the school systems,\" said Robert H. Eckel, president of the American Heart Association."}

The movie is set to be released at the end of May.\nThe film centers on the life of an insomniac writer who meets a teenage girl online, and a friendship that grows into an unlikely love story wrapped in harsh reality. The movie deals with various issues, including the romanticization of love, age-related issues in relationships, like statuatory rape (he's 23, and she's 16), and the idea of love in the online realm.\nRothman, a writer, amateur filmmaker and web designer, lives in the Los Angeles Area. He wrote, directed and produced the movie with Aurora Mae, his girlfriend and partner. Producing the movie for $200 while they were in college, they used friends as actors and later sold the camera on eBay to recoup the expense. \nRothman has spoken about the power of the internet as a distribution source for movies and has said \"I believe it's possible that this movie I shot with no budget and released online for free could potentially reach as many viewers as a major theatrical release.\"\nRothman and Mae started out with the idea of creating a full-length movie that could be shared totally for free online.

Two smaller rebel groups rejected it despite last-minute efforts to get their support. \nThe deal, which followed intense talks in Abuja, capital of Nigeria, calls for the disbandment of rebel forces and the disarmament of the pro-government Janjaweed militia. The conflict had killed about 200,000 and left about two million homeless. The accord, initiated by the African Union, was reached after two years of negotiations.\n\"I accept the document with some reservations concerning the power sharing,\" Mr Minnawi said. The SLM are the largest rebel group in the Darfur region of Sudan. One of his officials told that the SLM wanted more seats in parliament but had agreed to the deal to end the suffering of the people in Darfur.\nOpposition.\nTwo smaller groups said they were not happy with the terms of the deal. The Justice and Equality Movement (JEM) said it wanted fundamental changes to the document. The group's chief negotiator, Ahmed Tugod, reiterated the rebels' demands for the post of vice-president in the Khartoum government, to have the allocation of 6.5 percent of Sudan's national income to a Darfur development fund, and for greater representation in national institutions. \n\"We decided not to sign it unless fundamental changes are made to this document, it did not meet a series of key demands.\" Mr Tugod said. \nThe other faction of Sudanese Liberation Movement (SLM) likewise refused to sign it. \"We need the document to be improved upon,\" the group's spokesman Abdel wahid Muhamed El Nur said. \nMediators.\nRebel negotiators faced intense pressure to accept the amended deal, as diplomats from the United States, Britain, Canada and the European Union struggled to find common ground. The initial deadline for the peace talks was Sunday at midnight, but was extended thrice. The peace plan was prepared by mediators from the African Union and was amended after the rebel groups did not agree at an early draft. International negotiators, including U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Robert Zoellick, Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo and British International Development Secretary Hilary Benn, said the deal was the best hope for peace in Darfur.\nNew Plan.\nThe new plan decided to:\nRecent History.\nObservers said failure to reach an agreement would have been disastrous for the people of Darfur, who have suffered through three years of conflict that has claimed 200,000 lives and driven more than 2 millions from their homes. The conflict began in the arid and impoverished region early in 2003 after a rebel group began attacking government targets, claiming the capital Khartoum was neglecting the region. The rebels said the government was oppressing black Africans in favour of Arabs.\nOn the other side, Arab Janjaweed militias, drawn from Arab tribes, had been conducting a campaign of destruction with alleged help from the government. To flush out the rebels they had allegedly been targeting innocent civilians. More than 90 villages were burnt and destroyed, millions have fled their destroyed villages, with many heading for camps near Darfur's main towns. But there was not enough food, water or medicine. The Janjaweed patrol outside the camps and Darfurians said the men were killed and the women were raped if they venture too far in search of firewood or water. Many women were reported being abducted by the Janjaweed and held as sex slaves for more than a week before being released. Some 200,000 had also sought safety in neighbouring Chad, but many of them were camped along a 600km stretch of the border and remain vulnerable to attacks from Sudan. Chad was worried that the conflict could spill over the border. Its eastern areas have a similar ethnic make-up to Darfur.\nDarfur, which means land of the Fur, has the history of tensions for many years over land and grazing rights between the mostly nomadic Arabs, and farmers from the Fur, Massaleet and Zagawa communities. \nHuman rights groups said that genocide was taking place, though a UN investigation team sent to Sudan said that while war crimes had been committed, there had been no intent to commit genocide. In April 2006, the UN Security Council passed a resolution imposing sanctions against four Sudanese nationals accused of war crimes in Darfur that include two rebel leaders, a former air force chief, and a Janjaweed militia leader. \nSudan's government denied being in control of the Janjaweed and President Omar al-Bashir called them \"thieves and gangsters\". After strong international pressure and the threat of sanctions, the government promised to disarm the Janjaweed. But so far there was little evidence that this had been implemented. Thousands of extra policemen were deployed but the refugees had little faith in the Sudanese security forces. Some 7,000 African Union troops had slowly been deployed in Darfur on a very limited mandate. Experts said the soldiers were too few to cover the whole area, and the African Union said it did not have the money to fund the operation for much longer. Sudan was unhappy with suggestions that the UN take control of the peacekeeping mission. \nMany aid agencies working in Darfur were unable to get access to vast areas because of the fighting. They said a peace agreement is vital before the rainy season begins in June when planting of food crops must be completed. United Nations officials, meanwhile, warned that they would be unable to provide food and other aid to the more than two million people living in refugee camps unless the security situation improves."}

Election results are expected from as early as 10 p.m. SGT (1400 UTC).\nFor the first time in 18 years, the incumbent People's Action Party (PAP) has not won a walkover victory on Nomination Day on 26th April after opposition parties fielded candidates for 47 of the 84 seats. However, political analysts believe that the PAP will win a majority victory again.\nThis is the first parliamentary election for Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong after he took over from the former Prime Minister and current Senior Minister, Goh Chok Tong stepped down in August 2004 in a planned leadership transition. Lee, 54, is the son of the Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew, who was the Prime Minister of Singapore from 1959 to 1990.\nAs election surveys and exit polls are banned in Singapore, it is difficult to determine how the political outcome might be. However, in the previous parliamentary elections in 2001, the PAP won 82 of 84 seats with 55 walkovers. The 2 remaining seats went to Chiam See Tong of the Singapore Democratic Alliance (SDA) and Low Thia Khiang of the Workers' Party (WP). A win of less than 80 of the 84 seats could prove an embarrassment for PM Lee.\nThe last nine days saw intense campaigning from the incumbent PAP, the SDA, the WP and the Singapore Democratic Party (SDP). Several thousands of people attended the opposition rallies. Debates about the widening income gap, rising medical costs, job cuts, and calls for a less authoritarian political system dominated the campaigning."}

There were Sprite bottles spread out onto the street. The nearby Furniture Row shopping center was also hit hard. Some furniture was found as far as three-quarters of a mile away. Other hard-hit areas were Robinson, Hewitt, Woodway, and Speegleville. Densely populated Inner Waco was spared of any catastrophic damage, though hundreds, and possibly thousands, of trees have fallen, and roofs destroyed.\nThe main concern is restoring power to over 23,000 households and businesses. Many gas stations and grocery stores in the disaster areas were closed until power is restored. Those that remained open have had to throw out all perishable items. Also of concern is getting electricity to those with medical needs.

Only a week ago, an F1 tornado damaged many houses along Orchid and Kendall Lanes.

The opposition parties Singapore Democratic Alliance (SDA) and Workers' Party (WP) also retained one seat each.\nDespite having more seats contested in this election compared to the 2001 General Elections, the breakdown of seats remains unchanged from the previous election. However, the PAP only won a reduced majority, having only 66.6% of the valid votes compared to the 75% that it won in the previous election because of the spectre of terrorism and a poor economy then.\nThe PAP took all 7 contested Group Representation Constituencies (GRC) in Ang Mo Kio, Aljunied, East Coast, Jalan Besar, Tampines, Pasir Ris-Punggol and Sembawang, making up 38 of the seats. It also took seven of nine of the single seats in Bukit Panjang, Chua Chu Kang, Joo Chiat, MacPherson, Nee Soon Central, Nee Soon East and Yio Chu Kang.\nAmong the opposition parties, the WP had the best showing, taking 16.34% of the valid votes, which is an improvement over the 2.7% that in received in the previous election. In the Hougang ward, the incumbent Low Thia Khiang of the WP took 13,987 (62.74%) of the votes, defeating Eric Low Siak Meng of the PAP who only managed 8,306 (37.26%) of the votes while the remaining 277 votes were voided. The opposition win in Hougang is a big disappointment for PAP, which had dangled a carrot of some S$100 million in housing upgrading grants. \nDespite losing all of its GRC contests, its best performance was in the controversial and hotly-contested Aljunied, where it took 43.9% of the votes against George Yeo's PAP team who won 56.08% of the votes. Just a few days before, James Gomez of the WP was heavily criticised by the PAP for a non-submission of a certificate proving of his status as a minority. It then became a heavily debated issue in the campaigning until the PAP decided that it should move on to more important issues. Opposition position poster girl Sylvia Lim of the WP Aljunied team seems to be the most likely to be appointed as a Non-Constituency Member of Parliament (NCMP) as she got the highest non-winning number of votes.\nChiam See Tong of the SDA beat PAP's Sitoh Yih Pin in the Potong Pasir ward with a margin of 8,242 (55.84%) over 6,518 (44.16%) votes. The remaining 186 of the votes were voided. This is an improvement over the previous election where he only won 52.4% of the votes. However, they did not manage to win any other seats. They received more than 30 percent votes for the seats that they did not win.\nContrary to the performance of the other opposition parties, the Singapore Democratic Party (SDP) performed poorly in this election compared to the previous election. It lost all the 7 seats that it contested and only received 4.06% of the valid votes compared to 8.1% in 2001. SDP blamed the losses on the ban of political podcasts. SDP also alleged that the media waged a relentless campaign against it and that the lawsuit against it by the PAP prevented it from raising the issue involving the National Kidney Foundation scandal."}

The AU troops, now running out of funds, had largely been ineffective in stopping atrocities, leaving millions to struggle in camps with little food or water. While details for a UN peacekeeping force are finalised, the US diplomat said the US had asked Rwanda to send in some 1,200 troops to supplement the AU forces.\nIn a recent development, an unknown assailant shot a Spanish United Nations Aid worker in Chad.

Over the course of the weekend, these two giant puppets have been parading around London streets, closed especially for the event.\nWhilst Friday remained hot and sunny, the weekend turned wetter, but the rain didn't seem to put off the crowds, some of who received a second soaking from the elephant's trunk! The elephant stopped at Trafalger Square over lunchtime on the Saturday, before parading to Horse Guard's Parade, where seating had been specially erected around a giant stage.\nOver ten puppeteers operate the elephant, made mostly of wood, using a complex arrangement of hydraulics and motors. The elephant moves its feet, wags its tails, waves and squirts water from its trunk, flaps its ears, blinks, and can even open its mouth to reveal a moving tongue. The girl marionette is held on a big frame, and was given a ride on the elephant's trunk using a crane. The girl has been seen licking a giant lollipop, and even do a wee on the road.\nThe spectacle will end on Sunday with a grand finale."}

All the sponsors of this march are listed here. Depending on estimates, between 300 and 800 people marched, a low number by French standards.\nThe DADVSI law, among other issues, enacts an extensive protection of copyrighted content online and a protection of techniques, including civil and criminal penalties for help in circumventing them. Opponents contend that the bill, depending on how it is amended in the French Senate, could in effect criminalise the writing of players compatible with new online distribution formats for music, video or even text, and thus make such content unplayable on systems such as Linux, thereby generating a monopoly for established suppliers.\nSupporters of the bill, such as cinema and recording industry groups, contend that strong measures are needed to thwart online copying, which, according to them, is responsible for important losses of sales and revenue. They deny the risks for free software and other freedoms, claiming that, despite vague provisions, the law will be enforced wisely by the judiciary. They claim that new online legal commercial downloading platforms will flourish when peer-to-peer copying has stopped.\nThe bill is due to be examined in the Senate this week. Then, under the fast track procedure requested by the government, it may be signed into law by president Jacques Chirac after a mixed commission merges the text from the Senate and the lower house of Parliament, the National Assembly. Opponents have already indicated they would mount a constitutional challenge before the Constitutional Council. The bill, when it was examined by the National Assembly, proved divisive; the ruling UMP party was split on the issue, some even sponsoring a \"legal licence\" which would enable French Internet users to copy copyrighted content legally, provided they would pay a flat fee which would be split between the rights holder.\nProtesters, as well as deputies from all parties, contend that major lobbies influenced the bill\u2019s passage.

Some of those who threatened legal action to stop the soda sales are patting themselves on the back over the agreement, while lamenting that the deal did not go far enough, and now plan to press for more restrictions.\n\u201cThough there is room for improvement \u2014 sugary \u201csports\u201d drinks still will be sold in schools, for instance \u2014 this voluntary agreement is certainly good enough that CSPI will drop its planned lawsuit against Coca-Cola, PepsiCo, Cadbury-Schweppes and their bottlers,\u201d said Michael F. Jacobson, the executive director of the Center for Science in the Public Interest . \u201cI hope this settlement contributes to the momentum that is building in Congress for legislation that would require USDA to update its standards for foods sold outside of school meals. That would enable USDA to eliminate the sale of candy, cookies, French fries, potato chips, and other snack foods, as well as sports drinks, that are standard fare in school vending machines and stores.\u201d \nIn the wake of the announcement of the agreement by the three largest soft drink companies, their bottlers and the public health advocacy group, the Alliance for a Healthier Generation, Jacobson thanked his team of litigators for \u201cnegotiating effectively with the soft-drink industry over the past six months, and for demonstrating that the judicial system can play an important role in spurring public health advances.\u201d\nRichard Daynard, a law professor and president of the Public Health Advocacy Institute, which threatened the soft-drink industry with lawsuits, said in an institute press release, \u201cThe industry agreement with the Clinton Foundation and American Heart Association comes after sustained pressure from potential litigation and negotiations with public health groups and their lawyers. It is a credit to the role of litigation and the legal system as a component of effective public health strategy.\"\n\"This agreement demonstrates the potential of public health litigation to help control the obesity epidemic,\" he said.\nIn an email exchange with the James Logan Courier, Margo Wootan, director of Nutrition Policy for the Center for Science in the Public interest, said, \"Last week's announcement that soft drink companies will pull all sugary sodas from schools is great step toward improving school foods. This agreement is the culmination of the tremendous national momentum on improving school foods -- from the local policies (in LA, NYC, Chicago, Philadelphia, DC, etc.), state bills (in 2005, 200 bills were introduced in 40 states to get soda and junk foods out of schools), the strong bipartisan bill pending in the U.S. Congress, and threats of litigation against soda companies.\"\n\"While today's agreement is a huge step forward, it is by no means the last step\" wrote Wootan, \" We still have a lot of work to do to improve school foods.\"\nThe agreement, announced Wednesday morning by the William J. Clinton Foundation, means that the nation\u2019s biggest beverage distributors, and the American Beverage Association, will pull their soda products from vending machines and cafeterias in schools serving about 35 million students, according to the Alliance for a Healthier Generation, a joint initiative between the Clinton Foundation and the American Heart Association.\nUnder the agreement, high schools will still be able to purchase drinks such as diet and unsweetened teas, diet sodas, sports drinks, flavored water, seltzer and low-calorie sports drinks for resale to students.\nThe companies plan to stop soda sales at 75 percent of the nation's public schools by the 2008-2009 school year, and at all schools in the following school year. The speed of the changes will depend in part on school districts' willingness to change their contracts with the beverage distributors.\nSome food activists criticized the deal for not going far enough and undermining efforts to go further.\nMichele Simon, the director of the Center for Informed Food Choices, based in Oakland, Ca., called the deal \u201cbogus\u201d and a \u201cPR stunt\u201d by \u201cBig Cola\u201d in an effort to \u201csugar coat it\u2019s image.\u201d\n\u201cThis announcement could potentially undermine ongoing grassroots efforts, state legislation, and other enforceable policies,\u201d wrote Simon in an article at www.commondreams.org,\u201d For example, in Massachusetts where a stronger bill is pending, a local advocate is worried about the adverse impact, since legislators could easily think that Clinton has taken care of the problem and ignore the bill. What was already an uphill battle\u2014getting schools and legislatures to take this problem seriously\u2014was just made worse, not better, by this bogus agreement.\n\u201cEven from a health standpoint, the deal is hardly impressive. Diet soda full of artificial sweeteners, sports drinks high in sugar, and other empty-calorie beverages with zero nutritional value are still allowed in high schools,\u201d Simon wrote, \u201cAlso, parents concerned about soda advertising in schools will not be pleased with the agreement. Not a word is mentioned about the ubiquitous marketing children are subjected to daily in the form of branded score boards, school supplies, sports bags, and cups (just to name a few), which is required by exclusive Coke and Pepsi contracts. \u201c\nShe\u2019s not the only one criticizing the deal.\u201c While the initial details are promising, PHAI is concerned about some aspects of the agreement as it is being reported,\u201d Daynard said in the press release. \u201cThe continual sale of \"sports drinks\" is a cause for concern. While they have a role for marathon runners and others engaged in sustained strenuous sports, for most students \"sports drinks\" are just another form of sugar water. Furthermore, the change in beverages offered must be carefully monitored and cannot depend entirely on the schools\u2019 willingness and ability to alter existing contracts. Soda companies have spent decades pushing these unhealthy drinks on children and should bear the responsibility for their removal. PHAI is also concerned about the enforcement of this agreement and its silence on industry marketing activities in the school system,\u201d he said.\n\"Importantly, the agreement doesn't address the sale of chips, candy, snack cakes, ice cream, or any of the other high-fat, high-calorie, high-salt foods that are sold widely in schools,\" said Wootan of the Center for Science in the Public Interest, \"This is a voluntary agreement and is not enforceable, we need Senator Harkin's school foods bill to lock in the beverage standards and give them the force of law.\"\nEven the diet drinks, which will still be offered, need to go, said Ross Getman, an attorney in Syracuse, NY. Getman has advocated that soda should not be sold in public schools and that long-term \"pouring rights\" agreements, which give a company exclusive access to sell their brands at a school, are illegal for a variety of reasons.\nGetman, who contends that some diet sodas are contaminated with benzene, a cancer-causing chemical, said the soda \u201cindustry gets an \"F\" for incomplete\u201d for \u201cthe industry's failure to pull all soda from school and to recall products.\u201d\nSchools account for about $700 million in U.S. soft-drink sales, less than 1 percent total revenue for Coca-Cola, PepsiCo and Cadbury, the nation's largest soda companies.\nTen of the largest U.S. school districts have already removed soft drinks from vending machines, according to Getman. States including California, Maine and Connecticut have also banned sugary sodas in schools.\nexternal links.\nCenter for Science in the Public Interest"}

Most of them are in households headed by only the mother, catering for children. Their fathers got killed in the war, or some fathers are living but can't afford to care for their children; they have to accept the situation, so there is no way out. \" \nThe report says most people cited lack of economic and livelihood opportunities, as well as chronic poverty, as underlying causes for the ongoing exploitation of children. Parents reported feeling powerless to stop children who were having sex in exchange for goods and services, as they did not have the economic means to provide for their children. In some instances, families cited that transactional sex was a means of supporting the wider family to access things such as food or money to purchase food. In other cases, children identified more personal needs such as clothing or being able to access video clubs to watch films. The widespread nature of the problem meant it affected children in a broad cross section of environments. \nThe study, conducted by Save the Children, was intended to explore the ways in which children in 'Internally Displaced Person' (IDP) camps are vulnerable to exploitation and abuse as they attempt to meet their basic and other needs. It also explored the roles and responsibilities of humanitarian agencies in providing more protective systems for the delivery of assistance. During the discussions in the field, 315 men, women and children were consulted.\nThe people of Liberia have experienced ongoing suffering over the past two decades as a result of war and displacement. Children have been drawn into this in many ways, such as recruitment into armed forces, separation from their families, witnessing atrocities, rape and torture. Thousands have been driven from their homes into exile in neighbouring countries or camps for IDPs within Liberia, the report says.\nLiberia has been shattered by the 1989-2003 civil war which caused an estimated 250,000 deaths in a country of barely 3 million people. The war forced around 1.3 million people from their homes into camps around the capital Monrovia or abroad.\nElections late last year saw Harvard-trained former World Bank economist Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf elected as the new president. Her government faces a massive task in rebuilding an economy and society torn apart by years of bloodshed. Many Liberians have been, and continue to be, heavily reliant on humanitarian assistance as a means of survival. Those who are able to find work often still live in chronic poverty with the national average wage being only US$50 per month.\nThe report found that people unanimously agree that attitudes have fundamentally changed since the war.\n\u201cIt is like the cultural tradition is not holding any more. People have lost the cultural values and the tradition has been broken down. \u201d \nMost people said that children were not involved in prostitution before the war, or to a very small extent, and that this only happened in the cities but not in the villages."}
