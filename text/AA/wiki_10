Johnson then argued against same-sex marriage saying that \"Children come from marriage and families stem from marriage\". Johnson criticized the earlier ACT legislation that provided for the dissolution of civil unions by letter to the ACT registrar, stating, \"Marriage is a lifelong commitment\". However, Johnson went on to discuss the breakdown of marriage and the status of single parents to argue, \"surely we all agree that the best environment for the rearing of children is one that has both a mother and a father\".\n (, ), took a different stance in speaking to the motion, by discussing how the Government's new industrial relation legislation, WorkChoices, would affect the balancing of work and family life, and called for industrial legislation that would \"support families into the future\". \n (Liberal, ), the seconder of the motion, recommenced arguing against same-sex marriage, calling it a \"social experiment\", and went on to state, \"Same sex relationships, or, indeed, unions should not have the same status as a marriage between a man and a woman\". May concluded her speech by calling for support to \"services to assist children, young people and adults and to continue sustaining safe, supportive and nurturing family relationships\".\n (Labor, ) also affirmed support for heterosexual marriage, by stating, \"Marriage is a natural bond between man and woman, recognized in the vast majority of cultures, whether Christian or otherwise\", and added, \"nature ordains the natural procreative function of man and woman\". Murphy also addressed the amendments to the Marriage Act, saying, \"this definition is the only valid recognition of our civil laws, which correctly reflects the natural law and moral law\", adding, \"You do not even have to believe in anything to draw that conclusion.\" Murphy however stated in conclusion of his speech, \"we are all let down by those who \u2026 mask their support for marriage and who employ it as a weapon to attack the many other relationships in our society. Such attacks are unconscionable, unnecessary and unjustified.\"\n (Liberal, ) reiterated points raised by those before him, but also mentioned the issue of discrimination, saying, \"there is different treatment under the law for different relationships. But this is not about dicscrimination against the indivdual and it is not designed to be.\" Ferguson continued to say, \"As individual people, homosexual men and women have exactly the same legal rights as you or I\".\n (Labor, ) quoted a House Committee report \"To have and to hold -- strategies to strengthen marriage and relationships\", saying that the report was bipartisan and added, \"the issue of marriage does enjoy bipartisan support in this parliament\", and reiterated Labor's support for the Marriage Amendment, which excluded the possibility for same-sex marriage. Emerson concluded his remarks by again tying the impact of the WorkChoices to family life.\nFurther debate.\nNo other members of parliament spoke against or criticised the motion before debate was interrupted.\nInterestingly, the Australian Senate is yet to debate a motion moved by the in order to repeal the Marriage Amendment discussed and institute same-sex marriage. The are also supportive of same-sex marriage, but neither of these parties hold seats in the House."}

The project is still in a pilot stage, and is only available to UK residents, but the long-term future of the project could have a major impact on the way audiences interact with BBC content.\nThe project is partly inspired by the Creative Commons movements, and also by a general move within the BBC to be more open with its assets. Additionally, educational audiences such as schools have expressed an interest in using BBC content within the classroom, both to watch and to create multimedia content from.\nSo far, clips made available under the licence have included archive news footage, nature documentary footage, and video clips content designed for educational uses. \u201cIt\u2019s done very well with the audiences we\u2019ve directed them towards \u2013 heavy BBC users,\u201d says Paul Gerhardt, project leader. Users downloading the clips are also prompted to fill in a questionnaire, and so far 10-15% of people seem to be doing something with the material, although the BBC can\u2019t be sure what exactly that is.\nOne of the biggest limitations within the licence as it currently stands during the pilot scheme is that the material is only available for use by people resident in the UK. The BBC\u2019s Creative Archive sites use \u2018geo-IP filtering\u2019 to limit downloads to the UK, but there is some confusion over whether people who create their own content using the material can upload their creations to their own websites. A question within the FAQs for one of the more recent selections of clips suggests that this isn\u2019t possible, saying \u201cduring this pilot phase material released under the terms of the Creative Archive Licence cannot be used outside the UK - therefore, unless a website has its use restricted to the UK only, content from the 'Regions on Film' archive cannot be published on it.\u201d\n\u201cWe want people to make full use of this content, whether they cut and paste it or whether they share it, and we completely accept that we\u2019ve got a bit of a contradiction at the moment by saying UK-only and yet encouraging people to put it on their sites to share it with others, because you can\u2019t expect people to have geo-IP restriction technology,\u201d admits Mr Gerhardt. \u201cWe\u2019re thinking hard about how to deal with this after the pilot \u2013 at the moment it\u2019s quite likely that we\u2019re probably going to need to find a distribution partner outside of the UK, so that if you\u2019re outside of the UK you\u2019ve got roughly the same experience as in the UK, but the content could be surrounded by sponsorship messages or advertising or whatever. Once we\u2019ve done that then leakage from one to the other won\u2019t really matter very much.\u201d\nThe Creative Archive project has not been without critics from the commercial sector, worried that the BBC giving away their content for free would make it difficult for them to be able to make money from their own content. The BBC has explained to some of the commercial players that the content would be limited during the pilot, would not be available in broadcast quality, and that watermarking technologies would be trialled so that content could be recognised when it crops up elsewhere. The BBC is also investigating a business model for the future where there would be a \u201cclose relationship between public access to low-resolution content and a click through to monetising that content if you want to buy a high-resolution version\u201d. People who want to play around with the material might discover they have a talent and then find they need to get a commercial license to use it properly, Mr Gerhardt explains, and the project wants to make it easy for this to happen.\nBefore the project can go ahead with the full scale launch, it will have to go through a \u2018public value test\u2019 to assess its overall impact on the marketplace, and commercial media companies will have a chance to input at this point.\nFor ease in clearing the rights, all of the content available under the pilot project is factual, but in the future the project could include drama and entertainment content. The BBC may also, in the future, work the Creative Archive licences into the commissioning process for new programmes. \u201cThis raises some really interesting ideas \u2013 if you have a documentary series, you could use the Creative Archive to release the longer form footage, for instance \u2013 that would create a digital legacy of that documentary series,\u201d Mr Gerhardt explains. \u201cThe other interesting thought in the longer term would be for the BBC, or another broadcaster, to contribute to a digital pool of archive material on a theme, and then invite people to assemble their own content out of that. We could end up broadcasting both the BBC professionally produced programme accompanied by other programmes that other people had made out of the same material.\u201d\nOne of the ways that the Creative Archive licence differs from the other \u2018copyleft\u2019 licences like Creative Commons, aside from the UK-only limitation, is that the licence currently allows the BBC to update and modify the licence, which may worry those using the licence that their rights could suddenly become more restricted. \u201cThe licence at the moment is a draft, and we\u2019ve given warning that we may well improve it, but we wouldn\u2019t do that more than once or twice. The ambition is that by the time we scale up to the full service we would have a fixed licence that everyone was comfortable with, and it wouldn\u2019t change after that.\u201d\n\u201cThe ambition is to think about creating a single portal where people can search and see what stuff is out there under the same licence terms, from a range of different suppliers. The idea is that if we can create something compelling like that, we will attract other archives in the UK to contribute their material, so we\u2019d be aggregating quite a large quantity.\u201d\nThe Creative Archive project has captured the interest of many Internet users, who are growing increasingly, used the idea of being able to \u2018remix\u2019 technologies and content. Some groups have been frustrated with the speed at which the project is developing though, and with some of the restrictions imposed in the licence. An open letter to the BBC urges the dropping of the UK-only limitation, the use of \u2018open formats\u2019, and to allow the material to be usable commercially. \nMr Gerhardt has publicly welcomed debate of the licence, but makes it clear to me that the whole BBC archive will never all be available under the Creative Archive terms. \u201cWe will make all our archive available, under different terms, over the next five to ten years, at a pace to be determined. There would be three modes in which people access it \u2013 some of the content would only be available commercially, for the first five year or so after broadcast, say. The second route is through a \u2018view again\u2019 strategy where you can view the programmes, but they\u2019d be DRM-restricted. And the third mode is Creative Archive. Over time, programmes would move from one mode to another, with some programmes going straight to the Creative Archive after broadcast.\u201d\nOthers who disagree with the \u2018UK-only\u2019 restriction within the licence include Suw Charman, from the Open Rights Group, who has said \u201cit doesn't make sense in a world where information moves between continents in seconds, and where it is difficult for the average user to exclude visitors based on geography.\u201d On the project generally, though, she said \u201cI think that it is a good step along the way to a more open attitude towards content. It is a toe in the water, which is far preferable to the attitude of most of the industry players, who are simply burying their heads in the sand and hoping that lawsuits and lobbying for new legislation will bolster their out-dated business plan.\u201d\nOther organisations currently participating in the Creative Archive scheme include the British Film Institute, the Open University and Teachers' TV. Two artists have been awarded scholarships to create artworks using BBC archive material, and BBC Radio 1 has held a competition asking people to use the footage in creative ways as backing visuals to music. The process of making the BBC\u2019s archive material fully available may be a long one, but it could end up changing the way that people interact with the UK\u2019s public service broadcaster."}

A number of Odeon cinemas nationwide have been using digital projection technology to screen the matches live with a high definition (HD) picture. HD broadcasts contain a greater level of detail than traditional TV broadcasts, meaning a sharper picture and better sound quality. \nIn the darkened auditorium of the cinema in Covent Garden, the audience (or should that be crowd?) were behaving almost as if they were at the stadium, singing along to the national anthem, cheering at the England goals and groaning at the Sweden chances. At times, chants being sung by the England crowd at the match were even picked up and sung along to by those watching the cinema screen like some kind of football karaoke contest.\nTrailers before the match were replaced by a soundtrack of England anthems, both the successful and not-so-successful ones, and the traditional movie treat of popcorn was replaced by trays of beer (in plastic cups) being brought in by the punters. The cinema had cheekily listed the screening as being 'directed by Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson' and as 'starring Wayne Rooney (hopefully)'.\nDespite a disappointing 2-2 draw, the audience seemed impressed with the experience. \"I'm a bit short and so wanted to make sure I had good view without having to jostle around for position,\" Amanda, from London, explained to me. \"I also liked that it was non-smoking, and there was a fabulous atmosphere\". Sian, Caio and Laura, who lived locally, said they wanted to see the match on the big screen and commented on the excellent picture quality. \nOther events that have been broadcast by the cinema chain include concerts by Robbie Williams and Elton John. Odeon Marketing Director Luke Vetere said \"offering films is just one part of the cinema experience - our ambition is to offer guests the chance to watch other events they feel passionate about\". Watching football in the cinema is not a brand new event though, during previous World Cups such as in 1966, film footage from the matches was broadcast in cinemas after the event, providing a way for people to see the games in colour when TV broadcasts were in black and white.\nCinema screenings aren't the only way that fans can watch the World Cup games in high-definition this year though, as both Sky TV and Telewest have been broadcasting the games in HD to viewers with a special set-top box. There have been trials with HD on the growing Freeview platform too, with a pilot group of a few hundred viewers in London. However, as any move to roll out HD on Freeview would use up extra space on the broadcast spectrum and would require viewers to buy a new set-top box, it seems unlikely that this will happen any time soon."}

It deceived the Mexican defence and Maniche, who ran on to it, placed the ball high beyond Oswaldo Sanchez.\nThe second goal came after 23 minutes when Rafael Marquez reached with his hand to meet a cross from a corner. The resultant penalty saw a theatrical display by Sanchez on the goal line but Sim\u00e3o scored hard to his right.\nIf Mexico's Omar Bravo had a better game the result might have been a Mexican victory. In the first half he volleyed wide and via a Ricardo leg-save hit the crossbar; on 63 minutes through on goal he blazed over.\nBravo's best chance came on a 56 minute penalty kick after a move of neat passes ended with Miguel's arm connecting with Luis Perez's ball control in the area. Bravo stepped up and hit well over.\nStatistics say ball possession was equal and shots on goal were just shaded by Mexico despite the fact Ricardo La Volpe's side had to play the last half hour with 10 men.\nPerez received his second yellow card four minutes after Bravo had missed his penalty - sent off for foul simulation in the Portuguese penalty area, in an apparent attempt to get another. \nThe biggest threat to Portugal's goal was posed by Jose Fonseca.

However; though Messi was lively the Argentines struggled for space to trouble the Orangemen and Argentina had to settle for a draw, which was enough to top Group C. \nThe Netherlands, who had rested Arjen Robben and Giovanni van Bronckhorst, had the best of the first twenty minutes play. In this time they had 65 per cent of the play, although this was to almost even out by the end of the match. \nA goal nearly came when Dirk Kuyt robbed a defender to the left of the penalty box and ran toward goal. Had Kuyt passed to Ruud Van Nistelrooij instead of forcing a near post save out of Roberto Abbondanzieri there may subsequently have been a more open match. \nArgentina then had more of play though they needed a set piece to trouble the opponent's defence. A Juan Riquelme freekick fizzed low into the box and Khalid Boolahrouz almost tipped into his own net but Edwin Van Der Sar's right post intervened.\nThe teams denied each other space which made it hard to pass around the penalty boxes and get clear sights of goal. This is implied in the game statistics. Both keepers made three saves during the game; while - indicating some attacking play - there were 17 corner kicks as defenders successfully blocked crosses and shots.\nThe best two moments in a second half that was more scratchy than the first came from the boot of Tevez. On 72 minutes a hard shot from outside the box produced a one-handed save from Van Der Sar and a last minute effort from a long ball whizzed wide.\nIn the round of sixteen Argentina would play the runners-up of Group D who were Mexico.

The statement is signed by 67 of the 92 member academies of the organisation, and notes that in some schools around the world, \"testable theories\" about evolution are being \"concealed, denied or confused by theories not testable by science\".\nThe statement presents four \"evidence-based facts\" that no scientific evidence has ever contradicted. These include the Earth being approximately 4.5 billion years old, life on Earth being at least 2.5 billion years old, and commonalities in all living organisms indicating a common primordial origin based on the process of photosynthetic organisms.\nThe news follows developments, mainly in the , where there is a concerted effort to include the teaching of 'intelligent design' (ID), a theory which claims that complex biological features indicate that the presence of an intelligent 'designer' in schools. Opponents of this movement argue that it doesn't qualify as a scientific theory, and is simply a disguise for creationist beliefs. In the US, where the separation of church and state is mandated by constitutional law, efforts to include ID in school syllabi were quashed by the courts, as the teaching of religion in schools is against the Establishment clause of the constitution of the United States. Despite this, George Bush has in the past remarked that he believes intelligent design should be taught in schools. The President has not shown any sign of plans to personally intervene in the legal debate however.\nIn December 2005, following legal case between the parents and the school district of Dover (Pennsylvania, USA), the judge decided that intelligent design was a religious view, and that it was unlawful to teach it as an alternative to evolution within the classroom. The IAP statement suggests that the science academies believe that ID is still being taught within some schools, however.\nA Gallup poll conducted in May concluded that 46 percent of Americans believe that God created man in his present form sometime in the past 10,000 years, with 13 percent believing mankind evolved with no divine intervention and 36 percent saying that mankind developed over millions of years from lesser life forms, but with God guiding the process.\nThe IAP statement acknowledges limitations in current understanding, but argues that the process of science allows it to be open-ended and subject to correction and expansion as new understanding emerges."}

Haminu Draman ran on to goal with the ball and one-on-one passed it by Kasey Keller. Reyna was stretchered off with a knee injury; the USA captain came back on but was substituted before half time.\nLandon Donovan took the USA captaincy following Reyna's departure.\nThe second Ghanian goal was from a penalty. The ball was played into the USA penalty area and Razek Pimpong fell to the pitch next to Oguchi Onyewu. The replay was not conclusive but did show the defender's arms were not in a position to push hard on the Ghana player who had appeared to make a rapid fall.\nThough he was the last defender before the goalkeeper Onyewu was not cautioned for the challenge. Stephen Appiah converted the penalty inside right foot to top left of the net, seconds before half time.\nUnited States had drawn level from Clint Dempsey on 43 minutes when DaMarcus Beasley intercepted a defensive pass and weighted the perfect ball for the striker to run on too.\nThe crowd booed the referee when the half time whistle blew but in the second half their team did not do enough to put Richard Kingston, and the Ghana goal, under pressure. The USA got just three shots on target in the game.\nGhana conceded 32 fouls in the game and the pressure on their defence increased in the second half when they had to defend their lead.\nFrom Eddie Lewis's short cross to the near post Brian McBride went closest to making the score 2-2 flicking a header onto a vertical. Donovan got in good positions, a freekick close to the penalty area and a run into the box, but in both cases his decision to pass badly and not shoot relieved the pressure for Ghana.\nA feature of the game the FIFA Technical Study Group might look at was the number of Ghana players who spent a long time on the ground with injuries under challenges.

This was inconsistent with matches such as the clash between Serbia and Montenegro against C\u00f4te d'Ivoire (The Ivory Coast), where Milan Dudic of Serbia and Montenegro committed two fouls against C\u00f4te d'Ivoire the previous day and both penalties were awarded on that occasion. \nThere was high tensions in the last moments of the match, as Croatia was desperate to get a winner while Australia did not want to concede. This is reflected by the fact that this game was only the fifth time in World Cup history (and the second time in the 2006 World Cup) where three players had been shown a red card in one match. The other times were 1938 - Brazil vs. Czechoslovakia, 1954 - Brazil vs. Hungary, 1998 - Denmark vs. South Africa, and 2006 - USA vs. Italy. \nThree players were shown two yellow cards, but in the confusion of the last few minutes of the match, English referee Graham Poll had only sent two of those players off the field.\nDario Simic was first to go after fouling Harry Kewell, halting an Australian breakaway. Australian Brett Emerton walked when he committed a handball foul, preventing an attacking pass by Croatia.\nJosip Simunic should have gone at the 90 minute mark when Poll flashed him a second yellow card for what may be described as a rugby tackle in a last ditch attempt to stop another Australian breakaway. \nThe referee failed to realise that he had booked Simunic 61 minutes into the game and allowed him to stay on until he was booked a third time after the end of injury time three minutes later. In the Fifa match report, the last booking was also officially recorded.\nPoll later claimed to the Fifa referee committee when he booked Simunic for the second time he had marked down the number of Australian Craig Moore instead.\nAn earlier drama in a second half saw Croatia's go-ahead goal. Tim Cahill fail to challenge Niko Kovac until the edge of the Australian penalty area; this resulted in Kovac using the space for a low shot at Australian goalkeeper Zeljko Kalac. Kalac's egregious attempt at the save seemed almost like a dive out of the way when the ball hit a bad bounce in front of him, and rolled into the net. \nThe game started spectacularly with arguably the best freekick goal the tournament seen to this point, scored by Darijo Srna. Right footed, 30 yards out, he curled it over the wall and past the out-stretched right hand of Kalac into the top left corner of the Australian net.\nOn 37 minutes Poll penalised Tomas' handball and Craig Moore converted the penalty shot easily down the middle. Stipe Pletikosa gave plenty of space for Moore to shoot, having committed his dive a metre left while Moore was still having his run up.\nPletikosa later made two outstanding saves, a reaction stop from Kewell and then to grab a low cross amidst flying legs on his goal line.\nAustralia had more shots at goal and ball possession in the match, and their second equaliser came 11 minutes from time. Marco Bresciano's cross was flicked onward by John Aloisi, allowing Kewell to strike past Pletikosa near the far post.\nAustralia manager Guus Hiddink might think the match was a rather surreal affair, but the reality is he has progressed Australia into the round of sixteen for the first time at the World Cup finals.

He wants to finally make a feature length film, and decided that it was better to turn to the Internet for help and funding rather than plod through the usual 'development hell'. \n\"I wanted to put into practice what I\u2019ve been preaching as a film futurist for ten years, and the technology and Internet infrastructure has just really caught up with that vision now for me to put it into practice.\"\nThe process is inspired by the 'web 2.0' movement, using social and collaborative communities on the Internet. Matt doesn't see the funding as coming from donations, but as people paying a subscription to become part of a 'Swarm'. \"Rather than the 'many producer' model, this is more of an [sic] 'smart consumer' model ... members can help implement and bring their expertise into play, and so become more actively involved in the production.\"\nThe project hopes to use professional actors and crew, but use qualified members from the swarm as much as possible. The cast and the crew, including any volunteers that get chosen, would be paid for their work on the film, with Matt suggesting that this is \"a great way for people to get into the industry\".\nThose members not directly involved in making the film can still participate in the process by discussing ideas on a messageboard, and having a vote on certain crucial decisions such as which script gets chosen for production. Asked how he would balance his own creative direction with input from members, Matt said \"my vision will lead the project forward and define the parameters, but the Swarm can influence that, and indeed offer improvements or insights I might not think of alone\". \n\"Remember filmmaking is always a team effort - whether you are Martin Scorsese, Stanley Kubrick or Jean Luc Godard, you promote people within the project that will complement and bring something extra to the vision of the film. Give it more life. With the Swarm we are making that process more democratic, and giving a wider range of people an opportunity to shine and have creative input.\"\nMembers are promised a collector's edition DVD of the end product and exclusive merchandise, but the main distribution of the film will be via the Internet, using 'BitTorrent' and peer-to-peer networks. \"Unlike many other filmmakers, I'm not wedded to cinema projection as the 'be all and end all' - I'm much more excited about people viewing remixed versions on their video iPods,\" explains Matt.\nThe 'remixing' of the film will be possible thanks to it being distributed under a Creative Commons licence. Matt suggests that the 'younger generation' is more used to being involved with and interacting with entertainment, and points to remixes of the Star Wars films (eg 'The Phantom Edit') as an example of these 'mashups'. \"At the end of the project I would love to have an event that showcased five wildly different versions of the film, different visions from people other than my definitive initial edit,\" he suggests. The licence will be for non-commercial use only, however, and so commercial TV stations would still have to pay in order to screen the film.\nThe project is partly inspired by the success of 'The Million Dollar Homepage', in which British student Alex Tew aimed to raise a million dollars to fund his university education, simply by selling advertising space on a single web page. The publicity surrounding the idea, coupled with the 'viral' effect of Internet users passing the page on, meant that he eventually managed to make himself the million dollars.\nThe success of these projects partly seems to depend on them being interesting and original enough to attract enough attention, and it\u2019s often difficult to see how they could be repeated. Copy-cat versions of the million dollar homepage have so far failed to hugely take off. When asked about this idea, Matt responded \"I already expect people to copy the model we are inventing with A Swarm of Angels - it's a perfect way to create cult media, where the director gets more creative control and organically funds a project, and the fans of the project get more involvement within it. If the market gets too crowded with these projects though, then they\u2019ll have to be packaged differently to stand out. But that\u2019s what traditional film and media projects need to do anyway.\"\nOver 600 members have signed up to the 'swarm' so far, which Matt comments is already an early success, but 50,000 members in total will be needed in order to fully fund the \u00a31 million budget. Matt suggests that getting to the next stage, of reaching 1,000 members, followed by the phase of getting 5,000 members, will be the hardest part, as after that the film will be more 'tangible'. He expects to raise the full budget, but comments that if the fundraising stalls, \"options will be presented by advisors and The Swarm, and based on some kind of consensus we\u2019ll come up with the best option for moving forward.\"\nTraditionally, independent films are funded either through persuading wealthy individuals to invest, who sometimes are sometimes given 'Executive Producer' credits, or through organisations like the UK Film Council, who award funds from the National Lottery. A tax credit for producers making small films in the UK was announced by the government in 2005, in a bid to give a boost to the UK independent film industry.\nMatt says that the film will be \"a thriller with soft science fiction elements\", which he says will suit his target audience. \"But it will have an indie edginess to it, and be far more visually inventive than you would get with a 'normal' British independent feature.\" Contributors to the project include artists The Kleptones, who will help with the soundtrack, comic book writer Warren Ellis and documentary filmmaker Grant Gee.\nThe Swarm of Angels project is online at aswarmofangels.com and costs \u00a325 as an individual to become a member."}

It was a competitive match without much flair or accurate passing.\nA total of just nine shots and six corner kicks and the 42 fouls amassed suggested that the game was mostly played in the centre third of the pitch.\nThe first of three things to go wrong from the Tunisia perspective was the sending off of arguably their best player Zied Jaziri. He got his second yellow card a minute before half-time for a mistimed challenge which followed a yellow card for foul simulation earlier in the game. \nThe second crucial moment, when the score was still 0-0, appeared to follow from an Andriy Rusol foul a few yards away from his penalty area on 64 minutes. The caution Rusol received meant he would miss Ukraine's next Fifa World Cup match.\nAnis Ayari took the freekick and got it up over the wall; it was close enough to going in that it landed on the netting on top of the goal. Unfortuantely for Tunisia television replay showed a Ukrainian player in the wall, inside the penalty area, stuck his arm up and the ball had clipped his arm on the way through.\nThis was the fifth time in three days at the World Cup players in defensive positions had put their hand up in their own penalty area to stop balls; it also happened in Portugal versus Mexico; Serbia and Montenegro versus Ivory Coast; and Croatia versus Australia. In this match no penalty was awarded for the handball.\nFour minutes later Andriy Shevchenko made it 1-0 for Ukraine from the penalty spot. There was some question about whether the award was just. Although Shevchenko had done well to nip past the Tunisian keeper, and had two defenders in close vicinity, he had appeared to trip himself when he tapped his own left ankle with his right foot. \nFor neutral fans in the Olympiastadion a bright spot in a scrappy match came on on 89 minutes when Ali Boumnijel made a brilliant save from Andriy Voronin. Voronin was one-on-one with the Tunisian and the save seemed to block an almost certain second goal for Ukraine.\nBy that time the game was done and dusted and Ukraine were through to the round of sixteen of the Fifa World Cup for the first time in its history.\nStatistics.\nGroup H\nAttendance:\nReferee: Carlos Amarilla (Paraguay) \nTable.\n\"Fifa World Cup Group H table June 23, 2006\"\nRelated news.\nSpain edge out Saudi Arabia 1-0 in Group H"}

There could have been more goals; both Argentina and Mexico defended well and had timely saves from their goalkeepers. \nMexico got off to the best possible start with a goal from a set-piece after five minutes. Pavel Pardo's cross from the right touchline was flicked on by Mario Mendez and Rafael Marquez slid in to score on a half volley at the far post.\nFor Argentina the equalising goal five minutes later was the best possible response to going behind. A corner kick was swung in low to the near post; Hernan Crespo raised his foot, Jared Borgetti stuck out his neck and between them the ball sped past Sanchez.\nThe match had its moment of controversy. Just before half time the Argentine goalkeeper rolled a ball to Gabriel Heinze. Somehow his defender let it go past him to Mexican striker Jose Fonseca. Heinze lunged to bring Fonseca down. Massimo Busacca adjudged Roberto Ayala to be the last defender and spared Heinze the red card for the deliberate professional foul. \nGoalkeepers at either end made match saving contributions in the second half. On 53 minutes Roberto Abbondanzieri saved a defensive a clearance that deflected off Borgetti six yards from goal. Five minutes later Javier Saviola was through on goal; he went high and hard with the shot but Sanchez stuck out a strong left palm and batted the ball away for a corner. \nLionel Messi and Carlos Tevez replaced Crespo and Saviola as Argentina sought to break the deadlock. A minute from time Tevez thought he was through on goal but Ricardo Osorio got back just in time and the game was destined for another 30 minutes and that special moment in extra time.\nArgentina's win meant they would play their quarter-final match in the Olympiastadion, Berlin, against the host nation Germany on June 30.\nRound of sixteen.\nMatch 50\nAttendance: 43'000\nFormations.\nArgentina.\n\"Substitutes\"\n \"denotes one goal scored.\"\nMexico.\n\"Substitutes\"\n \"denotes one goal scored.\" \nOfficials.\n Referee: Massimo Busacca \n Assistant referee: Francesco Buragina\n Assistant referee: Matthias Arnet\n Fourth referee: Khalil Al Ghamdi\n Fifth referee: Fathi Arabati\nRelated news.\nGermany book quarter-final spot with 2-0 win over Sweden"}

France outscored South Africa, with four tries to South Africa's one, with a lot of South Africa's points coming from penalty goals. The French win put an end to an undefeated-at-home streak that the Springboks had been building, which was at 13 games before the loss to France. The win over South Africa is a good sign for France, who are also the current Six Nations champions, and the host of next year's 2007 Rugby World Cup.\nFrance opened the scoring after four minutes when winger C\u00e9dric Heymans gathered a kick to run in the first try of the match. Dimitri Yachvili was unsuccessful with the conversion, so the score was five points to nil. A few minutes later, the Springboks are awarded a penalty, and Percy Montgomery successfully kicks a penalty goal to take the score to five to three. France are awarded a penalty at around the 10 minute mark, and Yachvili successfully kicks a penalty goal to extend the French lead to eight points to three. France post more points with a drop goal from Florian Fritz, furthering their lead over the Springboks to 11 points to three. South Africa catch up in the subsequent five minutes, with Montgomery kicking another two penalty goals. In the 28th minute, South Africa takes the lead with another successful penalty goal by Montgomery. Subsequent penalty goals are missed by both nations before they go into half-time.\nSouth Africa score their first try of the match through Brent Russell. Montgomery is unsuccessful with the conversion attempt, with the ball hitting the upright. France hit back two minutes later with a try of their own through Vincent Clerc and Yachvili is successful with the conversion. Five minutes later, France are able to take the lead again, with Damien Traille scoring under the posts, and Yachvilli subsequently adding the conversion. With around 15 minutes remaining in the match, Traille kicks France's second drop-goal to extend their lead to 28 to 23. A penalty goal is kicked by Montgomery for South Africa, narrowing the score to 28 to 26, however, Clerc scores his second try of the match for France in the last ten minutes to secure the win.

There were only 7 shots on target in the 90 minutes and neither team controlled the play well. The scrappy match was broken by up 37 fouls.\nThe game had temperatures at around 90 degrees Fahrenheit, which caused several English players, including Beckham, to suffer from heat exhaustion and dehydration. Beckham was sick on the pitch shortly after his goal and was substituted before the end. \nEcuador had the best of the first 45 minutes. The slow tempo of the game seemed to lead to simple errors of concentration from England and favoured Ecuador's passing play. \nEcuador had slightly more ball possession over the game and also the first chance. John Terry's back header to his keeper fell short but Ashley Cole slid in to deflect Carlos Tenorio's shot onto Paul Robinson's crossbar.\nIn the second half England put more pressure on Ecuador's goal. However, passes into lone striker Wayne Rooney \u2013 who played 90 minutes for the first time since he recovered from injury \u2013 were often off-target. \nEngland's best chance to score from free play followed Wayne Rooney trickery on the left touchline. The striker evaded his marker but Frank Lampard spooned Rooney's cut back high over the bar.\nBeckham's free kick was a trademark fast curled pass from over 30 yards which beat the opposition wall and took a small touch off the fingertips of Cristian Mora before nestling into the bottom right corner of the net.

Mark Van Bommel and Khalid Boulahrouz had crashed two heavy fouls on Christiano Ronaldo; the second left a stud mark on his right thigh.\nAt the end of 96 minutes the yellow card count was 16 and the sides had nine men each. The four players sent off was a total that set a new Fifa World Cup record. This came as the 2006 tournament had already seen two games with three red cards. All four red cards were shown for two cautionary acts. \nFollowing the second Boulahrouz foul Ronaldo received treatment and would be substituted before half time. \nHowever; Ronaldo was involved in a wonderful move that lead to Portugal's game-winner. On 22 minutes he fed Deco, Deco crossed low to Pauleta; Pauleta laid it off, and Maniche side-stepped a defender to hammer past Edwin Van Der Sar from 12 yards. Maniche was spared his second yellow card, and subsequent, expulsion when the referee decided not to execute the FIFA guidelines for leaving the pitch during celebrations of a goal.\nPortugal also scored first blood when Ivanov's red card was brandished at Costinha for stopping a pass with his arm, after he escaped a second yellow card just minutes earlier after his second rough tackle of the day.\nThough Portugal looked dangerous on the break the game was dominated by the Netherlands who had over 60 per cent of ball possession.\nIn the second period there was less flow and more stoppages. The main incidents were violent and many times players surrounded the referee adding to the disruption.\nOn 59 minutes there was shoving after Portugal was awarded a free kick in shooting range of Edwin Van Der Sar's goal. In the scrum Luis Figo gave a headbutt to Van Bommel but was only shown a yellow card. Three minutes later the same Figo appeared to walk into an upper arm from Boularouz and Boularouz was sent off. \nDeco was next to go with two cards in quick succession. Ricardo Carvalho made a lunge to block one of the Netherlands 20 shots at goal. The Portuguese didn't stop for treatment, so the referee blew his whistle so the defender could get treatment. \nNetherlands bucked the informal tradition of giving the ball back and Deco's response was a lunge at John Heitinga. This incident kicked off another melee in which Wesley Sneijder was booked when he pushed Petit to the floor. \nFive minutes after his first caution Deco was sent to the touchline for holding on to the ball when the Dutch players wanted to resume playing.\nTwice up by an extra man the Netherlands did not beat the Portuguese goal keeper Ricardo. They went close. Three minutes after half time an unmarked Philip Cocu struck the crossbar in the rebound from six yards. After Deco's dismissal Dirk Kuyt ran through the central-defense but was foiled by a challenge from the goalkeeper.\nIn the final of the six minutes of added time Portugal worked another counter attack and Giovanni Van Bronckhorst got tangled with Simao's legs. Ivanov produced his fourth red card.\nThe victory for Portugal put them on a head-to-head with England in the quarter-finals, but at a cost.

A number of Israeli soldiers were wounded and a 19-year-old Israeli Soldier, Corporal Gilad Shalit was taken captive. He had been in the army for 11 months, and is the first Israeli soldier to be taken captive since 1994. Hamas' Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades, the Popular Resistance Committees, and the Army of Islam have claimed responsibility for the raid and Gilad Shalit's subsequent capture, although they have not confirmed that they are holding him themselves. Hamas claimed that the operation was in response to the recent deaths of civilians and the targeted killings of two militant leaders.\nThe raid followed the detention by Israeli forces of two Palestinians claimed to be Hamas militants in the Gaza Strip the previous day in what was Israel's first military incursion into Palestinian territory since its disengagement in 2005. \nAt least seven Palestinian militants took part in the attack, gaining entry into Israel via a more than 300-metre-long tunnel from the Gaza Strip. After crossing the border via the tunnel, the militants split into three groups and attacked a watch tower and an empty armoured personnel Carrier; while the third group attacked a tank with Rocket propelled grenade. Two militants died during the raid.\nTwo Israeli soldiers, Lieutenant Hanan Barak, and Staff Sergeant Pavel Slutsker, both 20 years old, died in the attack on the tank. The missing soldier was a tank gunner. A fourth member of the group was seriously injured.\nIsrael has responded by incursions into the Gaza Strip and air strikes on bridges and the major power station in the search for their missing soldier who is thought to be alive following Palestinian Authority announcements. Currently, the militants are reportedly demanding, \"First, the immediate release of all women in prison. Second, the immediate release of all children in prison younger than 18.\", until they release the Israeli soldier. The Popular Resistance Committees stated that they would execute a kidnapped Israeli settler, seized in the West Bank, if the Israeli Army moved in. Israeli police have not confirmed this claim, but are investigating the disappearance of an 18 year old settler.\nIt is believed that Israel is holding approximately 100 women and 300 individuals under 18 among the over 9 000 Palestinians incarcerated in Israeli facilities. Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert said in a speech in Jerusalem, \"The question of freeing [Palestinian] prisoners is in no way on the Israeli government agenda. There will be no negotiations, no bargaining, no agreements.\" He also has prepared the Israeli army for an extensive operation. \"The time is approaching for a comprehensive, sharp and severe Israeli operation. We will not wait forever,\" Mr Olmert said.\nUS Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice has urged Israel to give diplomacy a chance to win the release of the tank gunner.\nOther countries have been attempting to broker the soldier's release. Hoping to head off a potentially major conflict, Egypt has been trying to negotiate Shalit's release. So has France, as the conscript has French as well as Israeli citizenship. "}

At this time, one person has been injured from burns and has been hospitalised.\nIn a recent update on June 27, it appears that, for a second day, King's Cross will continue to be closed to passengers. The explanation for the closure is because gas cylinders near the fire and rail station were heated up and could explode. Many homes are within the 200 m radius around the site, and the station itself is about 100 m away from the fuel. The estimated 60,000 passengers per day on the station's rail lines will probably have to wait until around tomorrow (Wednesday) at noon, when the station is expected to re-open."}

This was despite the Italian team shrinking to ten men after Marco Materazzi was shown a controversial straight red card in the 50th minute.\nAustralia looked to have gained an advantage when Marco Bresciano surged through the Italy defence and Materazzi slid in to trip him up. Though there was an Italy defender on Bresciano's shoulder, Spanish referee Luis Medina Cantalejo deemed that the tackle was deliberately not aimed at the ball, and considered the foul worth more than a single yellow card. It would not be the only disputed decision in the match.\nBoth sides had a number of good opportunities to score, but the shots were generally too close to the box to beat the goalkeepers. The best save of the game was made by Mark Schwarzer from a Luca Toni effort 20 minutes into the game.\nGuus Hiddink delayed making attacking substitutions against ten-men Italy likely because he expected the game to go to extra time, and so wished to keep a fitness advantage later on in the game. Hiddink's only substitution, John Aloisi, came on at the 80th minute, while the Italian coach Marcello Lippi had made three, including the crucial one of Totti five minutes earlier.\nIn the attack Totti was a straight swap for Alessandro Del Piero, a fresh pair of legs which ensured Italy were a threat on the break right until the end of the regular period of play. It was a tactic that paid dividends in the end.\nThe second disputed referee decision was a penalty kick was awarded to Fabio Grosso three minutes into added time (and the last minute of game time). Grosso was running towards goal from out wide having avoided Marco Bresciano before being obstructed by Lucas Neill. The central defender had fallen to the ground early and Grosso, though not tripped, was impeded and dived straight over him. Medina awarded a penalty shot as this occurred within the penalty area.\nTotti, dropped from the game in favour of Del Piero, grinned slightly as he placed the ball on the spot. The ball was struck close to the upper-right corner of Schwarzer's box, the goalie could do nothing to stop the ball. It was the last kick of the game and the Italians celebrated.\nThe Budweiser Man of the Match was Gianluigi Buffon of Italy.\nThe prize was a quarter-final match against the lowest ranked FIFA team in their half of the knock-out tree, Ukraine.\nRound of sixteen.\nMatch 53\nAttendance: 46'000\nFormations.\nAustralia.\n\"Substitutes\"\n \"denotes one goal scored.\"\nItaly.\n\"Substitutes\"\n \"denotes one goal scored.\"\nOfficials.\n Referee: Luis Medina Cantelejo \n Assistant referee: Victoriano Giraldez Carrasco \n Assistant referee: Pedro Medina Hernadez\n Fourth referee: Eric Poulet \n Fifth referee: Lionel Dagorne\nRelated news.\nUkraine win penalty shootout; beat Switzerland for quarter-final spot"}

Kenya, Rwanda, Burundi, Zambia and Zimbabwe arrived in Uganda while South Africa jetted in on Friday evening. Uganda fielded two teams \u2013 Lady Cranes and a select Uganda side to replace the Nigerians who had pulled out of the tournament. \nThe games kicked off at 10:00am with great weather and apart from mid morning drizzle which quickly cleared up, it was a perfect day for 7's rugby. Tournament top seeds South Africa started on the right note when they had a comfortable 26 - 00 win against 5th seeded Zambia. Looking decidedly rusty in the game against their southern sisters, South Africa however steadily improved as the tournament progressed. Their disciplined defence, ball handling skills and excellent team work made them stand out and it was clear that this was the team to beat. South Africa beat a gritty Uganda Select side 22 \u2013 05 and finished off their preliminary games with a 14 \u2013 00 win over 4th seeds Kenya leaving them top of Pool A.\nKenya, whose men's 7's side are a regular inclusion in the IRB 7's circuit, also had comfortable wins over Uganda Select and Zambia beating them 33 \u2013 00 and 22 \u2013 00 to finish 2nd in Pool A. Zambia's only win in the group stages was against Uganda Select whom they beat 21 \u2013 00. Zambia and Uganda Select were 3rd and 4tth respectively in Pool A.\nPool B had second seeds Lady Cranes (Uganda) outplaying 3rd seeds Zimbabwe and Burundi. The Lady Cranes were determined to keep their unbeaten record and showed themselves a cut above the other teams in their pool in terms of pace and superior ball handling skills. Burundi was thrashed 56 \u2013 00 while Zimbabwe were eclipsed by a similar margin of 54 \u2013 00. Rwanda almost threatened to upset the East African queens and made the Ugandans work for a 24 \u2013 05 victory. Rwanda is the fastest improving team in East Africa and showed their intent when they comfortably beat Zimbabwe 25 \u2013 00 and hammered their hapless neighbours, Burundi, 41 \u2013 00. Zimbabwe beat Burundi 15 \u2013 00 in a scrappy game that highlighted the large gap between the two sides and the other teams in this tournament. Although Zimbabwe had the requisite skills they were unpolished and unfit while the Burundians had a very young enthusiastic squad who are yet to master the basics of the game. Lady Cranes topped Pool A, Rwanda was 2nd with Zimbabwe and Burundi 3rd and 4th respectively. \nThe first Plate trophy semi final matched Zambia against Burundi. Zambia easily disposed of the East Africans in one sided affair and humiliated Burundi 55 \u2013 00. The second semi final was slightly more competitive and once again against pitted Southern Africa against East Africa. Uganda Select won their second game of the tournament when they beat Zimbabwe 22 \u2013 00 to join Zambia in the Plate final. \nThe 1st Main Cup semi final was another one sided match with South Africa running all over the tired Rwandese to win 46 \u2013 00. Rwanda paid the price of depending solely on one player (teenage sensation Angelique Nzabamita) to win their games as the speedy winger was too fatigued at this stage to make any impact as she had been doing in the earlier games. There was a small consolation for Rwanda at the end of the tournament as Angelique Nzabamita was awarded the Top Try Scorers trophy.\nThe most exciting game of the tournament was perhaps the 2nd Main Cup semi final that was between arch rivals Uganda and Kenya. Ugandan fans expected the lighter, fleet footed Ugandans to run rings around their East African neighbours as they had done so frequently in the past. Those expectations were almost fulfilled when Uganda outpaced the Kenyans to score 2 tries (one of them a penalty try) in the first half and converted one to lead 12 \u2013 00. Apart from Zimbabwe, the Kenyans were perhaps the heaviest girls in the tournament but their fitness was several notches above that of the southerners and they had pace and determination to go with it. The Kenyans recovered and sped their way to two tries one of which was converted to level the game at 12 -12 just before half time. After the half time break, Lady Cranes sought to put an end to the tension and went ahead with a try that was not converted. Kenya however dug their heels in and Doreen Remour, who was outstanding throughout the tournament for the Kenyans, equalised taking the game into sudden death extra time. Although exhausted both teams put up an excellent display of rugby, neither ready to give way to the other with the first half of extra time ending after 3 minutes with the teams still deadlocked at 17 \u2013 17. In the second half, Sauda Adiru broke through a valiant Kenyan defence to score a try for the Lady Cranes and put an end to Kenya's hopes.\nThe Plate Final had Zambia taking on Uganda Select. The Ugandan second side had done very well to get this far and was eager to avenge their earlier loss to Zambia in the preliminary games. However, Zambia had been improving steadily with each game and was determined to take some silverware home. They were faster and more aggressive than the Ugandans and thumped them 33 \u2013 00 to lift the Plate trophy.\nThe Main Cup Final was the game all the fans had been waiting to see: the Southern African queens versus the East African queens. The two teams were evenly matched for speed but the South Africans had superior ball skills, fluid teamwork and a tighter defence pattern. The first half was a tightly contested 10 minutes with South Africa drawing first blood with a try that they were unable to convert. Uganda responded with a well worked try and converted to give themselves a slim 2 point lead at half time. However, after half time, South Africa's well marshalled defence kept out the Ugandan speedsters and on attack they displayed slick moves that split open the Uganda defence to let them through for 2 more unconverted tries (one of them a penalty try) to win the game 15 \u2013 07 and become the African 7's champions. The tournament's Most Valuable Player (MVP) award deservedly went to Charmaine Keyser from South Africa who dazzled players and spectators alike with her speed and great all round rugby skills. \nAll in all, it was a historic day filled with fantastic rugby and a large step forward for women's rugby in Africa. Hopefully further editions of the CAR 7's will include teams from Western and Northern Africa. With the 2009 IRB 7's Rugby World Cup including a women's competition, then this is definitely a step in the right direction."}

Tackles went in quick and hard but no side took any risks to win the game.\nThe statistics suggest Switzerland had more shots but they arguably were the more defensive team as they had started with one forward, Alexander Frei, whereas the Ukraine had three.\nFrei's single shot came from a first period free kick which shook Oleksandr Shovkovskyi's lintel. Ukraine's forward men amassed six shots; Andriy Shevchenko went closest on 20 minutes when his diving header came off the ground and onto the crossbar.\nUkraine did not play well and despite their more attack-minded formation were so wasteful with possession that they made statistically fewer chances than the Swiss with their 4-5-1 formation. Switzerland had 55 per cent of the ball in the game. \nFrom a viewer's perspective the Mexican referee Benito Archundia was lenient with tough challenges. A game with 44 fouls - one every three minutes - had only one yellow card. The yellow card was awarded on the hour to Tranquillo Barnetta for pushing a Ukrainian player as he ran toward the penalty area.\n15 minutes each way for extra-time was not used effectively by the teams; neither side attacked hard and in the second period there were no shots at all.

The turnout was over 76 percent of the close to One million registered voters, who constitute about a third of the country's population.\nThe referendum is being held as part of a transition from the country's present military government to a civilian one. The present government was formed in August 2005 in a bloodless military coup led by Col. Ely Ould Mohamed Vall, which ended then President Maaouya Ould Sid'Ahmed Taya's 21 years of strong-arm rule. The reforms voted upon must now be approved by the country's constitutional council. The new Constitution is to replace the 1991 one.\nThe referendum will now lead to municipal and legislative elections to be held in November, followed by elections to the parliamentary upper house and the President's post in 2007.\nThe new Constitution provides for a presidential form of government, with the President commanding significant powers, including the appointment of the prime minister. The Parliament though, can vote for no confidence in the government or censure it. The Constitution disallows members of the present junta from running for the President's post and requires future leaders to swear on the Qur'an that they will not amend the Constitution to stay in power. \nInternational observers from the African Union and the Arab League said that the referendum appeared to have gone smoothly, but have yet to make their final reports.\nPresident Ely Ould Mohamed Vall, who also voted in the referendum said, \"This is a great day and a rebirth for Mauritania ...

The statement made by U.S. press secretary Tony Snow gave the strong implication that Hamas will continue to be shunned by the U.S. and others until they renounce their stance on terror. \nAnother important aspect of these events is that Hamas appears to have broken the silence between them and Fatah, the other major Palestinian party. Hamas, controls the parliament after a recent election victory, forming a government led by Prime Minister Ismail Haniya, while Fatah controls the presidency with Mahmoud Abbas as president. Hamas and Fatah, after recent strife and violence between the parties, have agreed to a document that may help, even slightly, the relationship between Hamas and the PA.\nThe agreement between Hamas and Fatah on the yet-to-be-revealed document is still in place and looks fairly stable. There is an agreement of Hamas to let the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, negotiate with Israel, among other things that Hamas and Fatah are in agreement on. At the same time, Israeli PM Ehud Olmert has given warning to the Palestinian militants that military force is about to be used as Israel moves forces near Gaza if the captured soldier is not released. This document has been released at a time when Palestinians are worried about the recent movement of Israeli troops in response to the kidnapping of the Israeli soldier. Since the capture of an Israeli soldier by Palestinian militants, both the government of Israel and the Palestinian Authority (PA) have been under pressure, with Israel now moving many forces near Gaza. The Israelis have appeared to launch their offensive, with a bridge in Gaza being attacked by planes. It has now been confirmed that Israel to launch a ground offensive against the militants in Gaza."}

Bogaert and his colleagues at Brock University, Ontario revealed a possible link between the number of elder brothers a boy has and the likelihood he is to be gay. Whether this correlation be attributed to nature through the prenatal effects of the womb or to nurture through the psychosocial effects of growing up with elder siblings, however, remained unclear.\nTo further his research Bogaert studied 944 heterosexual and homosexual men. The men were either \"biological\" brothers and shared the same mother or \"non-biological\" brothers through adoption or as half or step siblings. Boegart reasoned that if the link between homosexuality and elder brothers was due to the nurturing effects of the family environment it would show regardless of any biological relationship.\nThe study showed, however, that the link was found only in biological brothers. The amount of time an individual spent being raised with elder brothers had no bearing on sexual orientation; the relationship was even found to be true in brothers who were raised apart from one another.\nBogaert writes in this month's PNAS: \"These results support a prenatal origin to sexual orientation development in men and indicate that the fraternal birth-order effect is probably the result of a maternal 'memory' for male gestations or births.\"\nHe suggests that each male foetus prompts a progressively stronger immune reaction in the mother's body. The antibodies that are produced by this reaction may account for sexual differentiation of the brain.\nScientists from Michigan State University added in an accompanying article: \"These data strengthen the notion that the common denominator between biological brothers, the mother, provides a prenatal environment that fosters homosexuality in her younger sons.\" \n\"Increasingly, credible evidence appears to indicate that being gay is genetically determined rather than being a so-called lifestyle choice. It adds further weight to the argument that lesbian and gay people should be treated equally in society and not discriminated against for something that's just as inherent as skin colour,\" said Andy Forrest, a spokesman for gay rights group \"Stonewall.\" However; Dr. Bogaert's study made no explanation for the origin of lesbianism."}

Brazil looked much more deadly going forward and got ten out of their 11 shots on target.\nRatomir Dujkovic's team's offside trap was brittle and beaten after just five minutes.

The forward did a step over in front of Richard Kingston and put in his fifteenth World Cup goal, his third in this championship - a total which surpassed the German Gerd M\u00fcller as the highest scorer in the history of the World Cup.\nAnother counterattack before half time led to Adriano's tap-in from Cafu's low pass across goal.\nGhana came closest to a goal when John Mensah headed a corner straight down at Dida's feet. The Brazilian keeper reacted quickly to save and kick the ball out of harm's way.\nThe third goal was from a simple long ball from full-back Ricardinho over the Ghanaian defence. Ze Roberto ran on to it and nicked it by the on-rushing keeper Kingston and coaxed it over the line.\nAt this point in the match the Brazilians had received boos from some of the crowd who thought football's traditional crowd-pleasers were deliberately playing within themselves. \nBut as the clock ran down there were a number of exciting Brazilian attacks and Richard Kingston had to make three outstanding saves to keep the score respectable for Ghana.\nAsamoah Gyan was sent off when he got a second yellow card for foul simulation.\nIn the next phase Brazil would play against France, in a game held in Frankfurt on July 1.\nRound of sixteen.\nMatch 55\nAttendance: 65'000\nFormations.\nBrazil.\n\"Substitutes\"\n \"denotes one goal scored.\"\nGhana.\n\"Substitutes\"\n \"denotes one goal scored.\"\nOfficials.\n Referee: Michel Lubos \n Assistant referee: Roman Slysko\n Assistant referee: Martin Balko\n Fourth referee: Mark Shield\n Fifth referee: Nathan Gibson"}

When they did have the ball they constantly pried at the Spanish offside line and therein found the weakness that lead to victory.\nThough the French were offside eight times the crucial equaliser came from a Franck Rib\u00e9ry run on to a Patrick Viera pass that beat the line of Spaniards close to half time. At speed Rib\u00e9ry rounded Iker Casillas to slot home.\nSo solid were the French in defence intercepting passes, blocking shots and making tackles the only goal conceded - which put them behind - was from a penalty kick. This was slammed in low by David Villa on 27 minutes after Pablo had been clattered from behind by Liliam Thuram.\nTen minutes into the second half the score was at 1-1 but the French continued to test the Spanish offside trap. A worried Luis Aragon\u00e9s brought on two substitutes and changed his system from 4-3-3 to 4-2-3-1. The Spanish defence sat closer to their penalty area so there was less room to pass balls behind them.\nBut still the Spanish line was caught on 82 minutes when Thierry Henry was fouled by Puyol as he attempted to connect with another through ball. Henry fell as if hit in the face by Puyol although this could not be confirmed with television evidence. Zinedine Zidane floated the resultant free kick into the box, there was an inadvertent flick on from a Spanish player and Viera nodded in at the far post off Sergio Ramos.\nAs the Spanish pressed for a last minute score the French broke through again, Zidane this time cut back to lose Puyol, and with the keeper off balance he reversed his shot to the near post to put the game out of reach.\nSo efficient was the French performance FIFA statisticians logged the team with just 19 minutes actual playing time.

These military commissions would differ from traditional courts of law in that: they would allow hearsay evidence; would be allowed to consider classified evidence during closed sessions, without providing the suspect a chance to hear the evidence or defend himself against it; and they would be allowed to use evidence coerced through torture.\nThe court denied the government's assertion that it lacks authority to review decisions by the D.C. Circuit Court because the Detainee Treatment Act of 2005 only strips the Supreme Court of appellate jurisdiction over cases filed after its enactment. \nTurning to the merits of the petitioner, it found that the crime Hamdan is charged with - conspiracy - is not a crime that violates the law of war and thus should not be tried by a military commission.\nThe court conceded that Congress has the prerogative to establish commissions such as the one desired by the Bush administration but found that it has not yet done so. \nThe Supreme Court ruled 5-3 with Associate Justices Breyer, Ginsburg, Stevens, Souter and Kennedy in the majority; Alito, Thomas, Scalia dissented and Chief Justice Roberts recused (he had earlier sided with the government on the appellate level).\nNine other detainees face charges before the military commissions. The Department of Defense had previously announced that it planned to charge an additional 60 of the 460 detainees remaining at Guantanamo before military commissions.\nReactions.\nLt. Cmdr Charles Swift, Hamdan's military counsel who filed the request, said: \"All we wanted was a fair trial and we thank the Supreme Court. Yes it is a rebuke for the process. [...] It means we can't be scared out of who we are.\"\nPresident George W. Bush said that his administration \"will work with Congress\" to address the issue and added that \"we're in a war on terror, that these people were picked up off of a battlefield, and I will protect the people and at the same time conform with the findings of the Supreme Court\".\nSenator Patrick Leahy (D-VT) said that \"for five years, the Bush-Cheney administration has violated fundamental American values, tarnished our standing in the world and hindered the partnerships we need with our allies. This arrogance and incompetence have delayed and weakened the handling of the war on terror, not because of any coherent strategic view it had, but because of its stubborn unilateralism and dangerous theory of unfettered power\".\nSenator John Warner (R-VA) said he doesn't regard the decision as \"a blow\" but rather as \"an interpretation of the law\".\nSenate Majority leader Bill Frist (R-TN) promised to introduce a bill after the July 4 holiday recess that would allow Congress to re-establish the military commissions.\n\"I will introduce legislation, in consultation with the Administration and my colleagues, that authorizes military commissions and appropriate due process procedures for trials of terrorist combatants,\" Frist said. \nIf a Frist bill is successful in becoming congressional law, along with backing from the executive branch, it would have the effect of over-turning the Supreme Court ruling."}

We\u2019ll handle it with determination and prudence, with unity and loyalty and always with respect to the memory of the victims,\u201d said Mr Zapatero.\nAt a news conference Mr Zapatero said the proposed talks would discuss the dismantling of ETA's organisation and the 500 ETA prisoners in Spanish jails but not Basque independence. \"Democracy will not pay any political price to achieve peace,\" Mr Zapatero said.\nThe Spanish opposition Popular Party did not give their full support for Mr Zapatero's peace bid. They particularly objected to talks with Batasuna, the political front of ETA. \"Any normal person understands you can't negotiate with someone whose negotiating weapon is as powerful and hard to argue with as a pistol,\" said Popular Party leader Mariano Rajoy.\nETA had been fighting a terrorist war since Franco's era until it announced a permanent ceasefire March 22, 2006. The group was responsible for 817 deaths over its 38-year campaign while staking its claim for territory in northern Spain and south-western France.\nETA says the motivation for talks is so the Basque people get to decide their own future. \nTheir request last week came after three months of ceasefire. Though ETA had not killed since 2003 it had continued to explode bombs and extort money from businesses. \nIt is thought a six-year police crackdown on militants and opinion polls that suggested not all Basques wanted independence made violence a counter-productive strategy for ETA. Violence also had become associated with September 11, 2001 and the 2004 Madrid bombings."}

The two prime ministers met in Belfast at Stormont today with the major parties about the deadline.\nBlair stated he would shut down the Northern Ireland Assembly, cut the salary and benefits of all 108 members and forge a stronger direct rule with the Republic of Ireland. He also stated that both governments were not willing to continue talks past the deadline and would instead work on developing joint policies in Northern Ireland.\nBlair who is under pressure to resign by next year is seeking a more permanent peace settlement before he leaves office.\n\"This is the last chance for this generation, really, to make this process work,\" Blair said. \"We've come a long way, but we need to get the rest of the way now.\"\nAhern said that he wanted to see the institutions active as soon as possible. He added, \"The reality of this is that if we don't do this by November 24 then we lose a huge opportunity.\"\nThe two prime ministers have also published a in-depth time-line stating what negotiators must accomplish to establish a joint power-sharing administration, one of the main goals of the Good Friday Agreement signed in 1998, by the deadline.\nThe administration would be led by the two main parties, the Democratic Unionist Party led by Ian Paisley and Sinn F\u00e9in, led by Gerry Adams.\nThe parties gave their opinions over the visit by the prime ministers.\nThe deputy leader of the Democratic Unionist Party, Peter Robinson, said their party stressed the need for the assembly to meet. He added, \"If negotiations are going to begin in the autumn, then the assembly is going to have to meet between now and then. We can not move on to the next stage unless we move in the sequence of scoping the issues, debating the issues and then negotiating the issues.\" Robinson is referring to the fact that the Assembly will go on a summer recess soon.\nSinn F\u00e9in leader Gerry Adams hoped the process could move on. \"The two governments sought to reassure us of their total commitment to the November 24 deadline and their commitment to making this process work. \"We now want them to match that verbal commitment with action in the time ahead,\" stated Adams.\nYesterday, Sinn F\u00e9in announced that the party is thinking of withdrawing from the Northern Ireland Assembly in autumn, after launching an internal review. The review could shift the party's focus from a devolution deal to the next election if the deal is unlikely by the November 24 deadline.\nThe leader of the Ulster Unionist Party, Sir Reg Empey, said that anyone who has no intention of meeting the November 24 deadline should \"have the guts to say so\". Empey added, \"We want to see devolution restored if the conditions are right at the time and we will spare no effort to see that is achieved.\" \nDavid Ford, the leader of the Alliance Party said that his party is sharing the frustration of the people of Northern Ireland. He added, \"Alliance is prepared to work its socks off until November to get an assembly restored but we need the governments to play their part as well.\"\nThe leader of the Social Democratic and Labour Party, Mark Durkan, said ahead of his meeting with the two \"The taoiseach and the prime minister shouldn't have to be here today trying to make sense out of a lot of the nonsense that is coming from some of the parties. I hope the two premiers are clear in their message today that they want to see the parties here get on with it, because that is what the public want to see.\" \nOn May 15, the parties took their seats in the first session of the Northern Ireland Assembly since October 2002. The assembly had been suspended since 2002 over allegations of a republican spy ring. Direct rule from London has been in place since then.\nA Preparation for Government Committee has been formed consisting of the various major parties, but progress has been slow. Especially since the DUP will not cooperate with Sinn F\u00e9in until the Irish Republican Army completely disbands. Last year, the IRA decommissioned their weaponry.\nBlair and Ahern plan to return to Northern Ireland in October after the publication of a report on paramilitary activity.\nMeanwhile, before meeting with the parties, the two prime ministers ventured to Ballymena, County Antrim to meet with cross-community students. The meeting is in response to murder of Michael McIlveen, a 15-year-old Catholic boy by a loyalist/unionist mob in County Antrim."}

Tory calls it a useless use of funds and an inappropriate change because the new logo too closely resembles the flower seen in the Liberal Party banner.\nThe logo was introduced in 1964. It has undergone minor redesigns, but always remained a stylized T-shaped trillium.

The objective is to test the aircraft in real firefighting situations this summer, these tests will then provide information for the Ministry of Internal Administration, so that this can make a final decision about a purchase.\nWith the double of capacity for the transport of water and fire retardants of other aerial firefighting aircraft that usually operate in Portugal, mainly the Canadair CL-415, the Beriev will operate throughout Portugal, independently of its base. The Beriev's capacity is almost twice that of the Canadair, 12,000 L/h and 6,160 L/h respectively.\n\"As of June 1, the aircraft will enter in operational tests in real environment, during 60 days\", Gil Martins, operations commander of the National Center of Rescue Operations, told R\u00e1dio de Renascen\u00e7a News Agency.\n\"The Beriev is an amphibious aircraft of the same type as the Canadair, that transports a dozen tons of fire retardants, the double than a Canadair aircraft\", Martins added.\nThe aircraft arrives Thursday night at Monte Real Air Base, were he will stay until August 31, and will be visited tomorrow (July 1) by the Minister of Internal Administration, Ant\u00f3nio Costa.\nThe plan is to purchase four heavy aircraft for fighting forest and ground fires which will become available in 2008. In addition to the order of airplanes the Government as purchased six medium and four light helicopters, in two separate bids, in which the deal for the six medium helicopters caused the dispute of an multimillion dollar war between the three competing companies in the courts.\nThe international contest was launched by the Portuguese Government in November 2005 for six medium helicopters was participated in by: Heliportugal, Helisul, Helibravo, Eurocopter and the Polish PZL. With the decision made by a jury of seven members, in April the Cabinet decided to purchase from Heliportugal six Kamov 32 helicopters worth 42.1 million EUR, scheduled to arrive June 1.\nEarly this month the Polish company PZL interposed an action for a provisional legal remedy to the Supreme Administrative Court. In June 21 the Portuguese company Helisul made a plea for the decision of the Cabinet in April 27.\nWith about 3.2 million hectares of forest in 1995 and 2.5 million hectares in 2005, Portugal lost about fifth of its forest in ten years to forest fires."}

First it was Germany who were unable to be positive as Argentina dominated play with 65 per cent of ball possession. \nUntil their goal Argentina controlled the game. \nFour minutes after half-time Roberto Ayala got across Miroslav Klose to meet Juan Riquelme's corner which he powered between Jens Lehmann and his near post guard, Philipp Lahm.\nThe goal early in the second period made for a more exciting match which had been mostly uneventful in a first half during which neither side could muster more than a single shot. However; good scoring chances where hard to come by.\nJuergen Klinsmann may be credited with a substitution change that partially helped Germany get an equalising goal. The fast David Odonkor troubled Juan Sorin and the Argentine left flank and allowed Germany to press forward nearer to the opposition penalty area.\nArgentine manager may also have made a tactical mistake and suffered form a moment of bad fortune. In the minutes before Germany equalised from Ballack's wonderful left field cross his goalkeeper had to be stretchered off with a muscle injury.\nJose Pekerman followed his keeper's substitutions with two defensive ones; taking off creative midfield playmaker Riquelme and forward Hernan Crespo. The gifts of Lionel Messi and Javier Saviola were left on the bench while Julio Cruz, a long ball-holding forward, was brought on to partner Carlos Tevez.\nThe bad luck and changes seemed to put Germany in charge of the tactical game for the first time in the match.\nA minute after Cruz arrived Pekerman might have regretted his decision. Klose's fifth World Cup goal ten minutes from time put him at the top of the Fifa Golden Boot leader board as the tournament's highest goalscorer. He beat his marker to dip and head beyond Leonardo Franco after Tim Borowski, a substitution on 74 minutes, had flicked on a Ballack cross.\nThe game finished 1-1 and the two halves of extra time mirrored the match; first half uneventful, the second half more attacking. Fabricio Coloccini came closest to breaking the deadlock when he hit the crossbar from 45 yards trying to catch Lehmann off his goal line.\nNeither Germany or Argentina had lost in a World Cup penalty contest; both sides had won three. All the penalties hit the target and were well struck, except Ayala's who hit a soft effort which Lehmann saved to his left. Cambiasso's effort to Lehmann's left was better struck but the keeper had guessed the right side to dive to break Argentine hearts.\nPost shootout melee\nFIFA launched an investigation into an on-field melee which began after the penalties had been decided in Germany's favour.\nPunches and kicks were thrown in the tangle. Unused Argentine substitute Leandro Cufre assaulted German Per Mertesacker and was presented the red card by Lubos Michel.\nAccording to the German captain Michael Ballack the conflict originated when Argentine players shouted at the German team during the shootout. When Tim Borowski got Germany's fourth penalty he made a sign to the Argentine players to be quiet.\nAfter the penalty kicks Argentine players approached Borowski and a scuffle of mostly pushing began that involved dozens of players, referees, coaches and substitutes.\nFIFA said television pictures would be looked at and fines or sanctions would be considered if appropriate.\nQuarter-finals.\nMatch 57\nAttendance: 72'000\nPenalties.\n\"Notes are from the goalkeeper's view.\"\nFormations.\nGermany.\n\"Substitutes\"\nCoach: Juergen Klinsmann\n \"denotes one goal scored.\"\nArgentina.\n\"Substitutes\"\nCoach: Jose Pekerman\n \"denotes one goal scored.\"\nOfficials.\n Referee: Lubos Michel \n Assistant referee: Roman Slysko\n Assistant referee: Martin Balko\n Fourth referee: Massimo Busacca\n Fifth referee: Francesco Buragina\nRelated news.\nItaly brush Ukraine aside 3-0 to reach semi-final"}

Arnold Schwarzenegger signed a bipartisan state budget Friday that invests a record $55.1 billion in education - an increase of $3.1 billion this year and $8.3 billion over the last two years - and allocates $4.9 billion to create a budget reserve and to pay down the state's debt early.\nSchwarzenegger credited bipartisan cooperation in coming up with a budget he was willing to sign, and do it on time, a rarity in recent California politics.\n\"It's amazing what can be accomplished when Democrats and Republicans work together in Sacramento,\" said Schwarzenegger. \"I want to thank the legislative leadership - Senators and Dick Ackerman, Speaker Fabian Nunez and Assembly Republican Leader George Plescia - for all their hard work on the budget. We put politics aside and were driven by the overwhelming desire to do what's best for the people of California. \n\"I am especially proud that the budget expands preschool, and returns art, music and physical education classes to our children,\" he said.\n said he is pleased by the budget. \"The budget passed by the Legislature brings welcome support to education in California, making good on past debts to our schools and investing in sorely needed classroom programs,\" he said.\nHe had his own budget favorites: \"I\u2019m particularly pleased that the budget includes increased funding for school counselors, teacher professional development, programs targeted to helping students pass the high school exit exam, and expanded and improved student nutrition programs.\n\"While there are some priorities over which we may disagree, I applaud the Governor and the Legislature for a budget that makes education a top priority.\"\nBarbara E. Kerr, president of the 335,000-member , also likes the direction of the new budget.\n\u201cThe timely approval of the new state budget is good news for our public schools and students,\" she said. \"School districts and teachers can now plan ahead. The nearly six percent cost-of-living-adjustment will allow local schools to restore funding to education programs that have been cut over the past few years and provide for salary increases.\"\nStill, Kerr, said, the budget doesn't go far enough. \u201cThis budget is a down payment on the debt owed to our schools. Teachers will continue to work with the governor and the Legislature to ensure repayment of the $3 billion still owed to our schools under Proposition 98 and the lawsuit settlement agreement announced last month. That money will help our schools of greatest need reduce class sizes, improve teacher training and increase parental involvement.\"\nHow the budget affects the and , or the, specifically is not yet clear.\n, who is running for governor against Schwarzenegger, liked the increased education funding, and praised his fellow Democrats in the legislature for that, but criticized the entire budget for being out of balance.\n\u201cOn higher education, Democrats in the Legislature did the right thing, when the governor would not, and gained a $6 per unit rollback in community college fees,\" he said in a statement. \"That is a start. But the governor\u2019s budget will still leave community college fees nearly double what they were just three years ago. And the budget will also leave untouched the fees at CSU and UC, which have increased by $2,000 and $5,000 respectively under Governor Schwarzenegger.\"\nMissing from the budget, Angelides said, is funding to expand health care for low-income children. Schwarzenegger \"failed to get members of his own party to agree to a budget that funds health care for more kids from low-income families on the Healthy Families program regardless of the families\u2019 immigration status. Compassion requires \u2013 and intelligent public health practice demands \u2013 that all people residing in California have access to adequate health care,\u201d Angelides said.\nSchwarzenegger credited a strong economy that increased state revenues for providing the cash to cover the increased expenditures and set aside a $2.1 billion reserve and an additional $2.8 billion for debt prepayment. Included in that is $1.42 billion for repaying borrowed funds earmarked by the voters for transportation projects aimed at reducing traffic throughout the state. The early debt payment and the reserve account for nearly 4.7 percent of the overall budget - the highest in 25 years.\nStill, Angelides said, the budget is out of balance and the state is running up more debt. \u201cDespite his repeated pledges to \u2018cut up the credit card\u2019 Governor Schwarzenegger has produced a budget that still leaves a $3.3 billion structural budget deficit for 2006-07 and more deficits for years to come,\" Angelides said, \"It is a budget that\nwill continue to shift the burden of today\u2019s deficits onto the backs of future\ngenerations.\"\nThe budget largely mirrors the May Revise, which has since prompted all three Wall Street credit rating agencies to upgrade the state credit rating, reducing the cost of state borrowing. One of the agencies, , cited \"California's continuing economic recovery, strong revenue performance and continued progress in reducing fiscal imbalance\" when upgrading their rating on the state's general obligation debt from A to A+ last month. also raised its rating from A to A+ in May. raised its rating from A2 to A1 the same month.\nDespite the improved credit ratings, Angelides said, the three rating agencies still have reservations about the state's fiscal future. The agencies \"have corroborated my warning and that of the Legislative Analyst that while state revenues have improved, California\u2019s fiscal condition will remain insecure until the state produces balanced budgets,\" he said.\nHighlights of AB 1801, the Budget Act of 2006 by Assembly member John Laird (D-Santa Cruz), include:\nPreschool through High School Education - The budget includes $100 million for the Governor's targeted preschool initiative, which will make preschool available to every four year old living in a low-performing school district. $50 million of this funding will be used to build and improve preschool facilities. The budget also includes $645 million to fund physical education, arts and music programs. Overall, $11,264 will be spent on each student, an increase of $516 from the current year.\nHigher Education - The budget allocates $19.1 billion from all sources for higher education and eliminates tuition and fee increases at UC and CSU. California, which already has the lowest community college fees in the nation, will further lower student fees from $26 per unit to $20, effective Spring 2007.\nLaw Enforcement - The budget includes an additional $196 million to support law enforcement efforts, including money to fund Sexual Assault Felony Enforcement teams, 500 GPS devices to track and monitor the highest-risk parolees and four new Gang Suppression Enforcement Teams. The budget also proposes the addition of 235 California Highway Patrol positions, includes $56.4 million to replace the CHP's existing radio system and allocates $6.4 million to handle the increasing number of wireless calls. Additionally, the budget includes a $20 million investment to strengthen efforts to fight methamphetamine trafficking and $6 million to create three new California Methamphetamine Strategy program teams.\nDisaster Preparedness - The budget provides $220 million to enhance California's ability to prepare for, mitigate and respond to emergencies, including money to strengthen public health response during a disaster. This includes preparations to prevent a pandemic influenza outbreak and expanding efforts to help local governments develop disaster preparedness plans.\nPublic Health - The budget includes $22.6 million for counties to perform outreach and enrollment activities to reach the 428,000 children who are eligible for Medi-Cal or the Healthy Families program but are not enrolled. The budget for the Healthy Families program also covers enrollment growth for 78,200 additional children.\nTransportation - In addition, the Budget makes a substantial investment in improving California's transportation system. It provides $1.4 billion to fully fund Proposition 42 for the second consecutive year, and it provides an additional $1.4 billion for the early repayment of past loans from Proposition 42, for a total of $2.8 billion. Of the $1.4 billion repayment, $440 million is designated for cities and counties for local road and street maintenance that would otherwise not be funded.\nThe budget is the first on time budget since 2000 and the fourth in the last 20 years. The 2006-07 budget's general fund is $101.3 billion and total is $131.4 billion. For a more detailed overview of the budget, please visit www.dof.ca.gov."}

The cabins are supplied with oxygen because of the thin air at the high altitudes. The windows have ultra-violet filters to keep out the sun's glare.

It is thought to be an unnecessary sacrifice of a publicly owned resource and the habitat of native animals for short term profits. The industry is subsidised through provision of publicly funded infrastructure and a unreasonably low royalty levied on harvesters of the resource.\nAll Eden wood chips are exported, mostly to pulp and paper mills in Japan and the paper made from Eden chips is generally copy paper used in the printing industry and it is consumed within Japan. Since its establishment, Eden has exported over 35 million tonnes of native forest chips.\nThe Eden chip mill exports approximately 900,000 tonnes of chips a year, and is heading for 1 million tonnes in the next couple of years, produced from native forests each year and Australia is the only country that continues to trade forest wood chips to Japan, as all other supplier countries use plantation stock to produce chips.\nThe rally was organised with police cooperation and was conducted without any incident."}

The casinos attempted to get a similar exemption, but that was definitively rejected by the New Jersey Supreme Court. \"Critical\" services like the New Jersey State Police, the state's prisons, and hospitals will continue to operate without funding. All non-essential employees of the state were given leave from July 1 on.\nAll 12 casinos in Atlantic City locked their doors for the first time in the 28-year history of legalized gambling in New Jersey. Casino inspectors, who are state employees, are no longer working. While the casino floor is shut down, many casinos have remained open for hotel, restaurant, and entertainment business.\nMembers of both houses of the Legislature have been kept in the capital, Trenton, to help a speedy passage.\nA similar situation occurred in Minnesota exactly one year ago as the Legislature failed to pass the budget before they were forced to adjourn by a hard-wired date in the state constitution."}

It is not known if anyone was inside the house at the time the accident occurred. Police said no major injuries were sustained as a result of the accident.\nThe accident occurred in light rain and the road surface was moderately wet.\nIt is believed that the truck was traveling along Eleven Mile Drive, Eglinton when a Subaru Forester pulled into its path from a side street. The Subaru had been required to give way to the truck. The truck struck the Subaru, hitting it and pushing it down the road before losing control and hitting a house on the opposite side of the road.\nThe driver of the truck was trapped inside his vehicle for around 15 minutes before being released by rescue personnel, the driver of the Subaru was taken by ambulance to the Bathurst Base Hospital to ensure they were not suffering any major injuries.\nWhen the truck hit the house, a gas line was ruptured creating a hazard for rescue crews. The pipeline's operator - Agility disconnected the line after the truck driver was rescued. Police also requested that electricity to the house be disconnected.\nIt was not until 4:15 p.m. that approval was given for the truck to be pulled from the house. It is expected that engineers from Bathurst Regional Council will inspect the house to determine if it is still structurally safe.\nWhile it is not unusual in Bathurst for trucks to hit homes, it is unusual for such an accident to occur at this location. Most accidents of this nature occur on the Great Western Highway, which intersects the city and is a freight gateway to the region."}

The launch, from Cape Canaveral in Florida, had previously been delayed twice due to poor weather conditions. The expected 13-day mission has been described as critical to the future of the International Space Station (ISS) as well as the shuttle and the entire NASA fleet.\nThere were concerns over a 5\" by 1/2\" crack in the insulation foam that was found late last night. NASA officials dismissed the crack saying it was less than the size required to cause damage at launch. \nThe Discovery mission is to deliver critical supplies to the ISS, test shuttle-inspection techniques and to drop off European Space Agency astronaut Thomas Reiter for his 6-month stay in the ISS.\nOver the last three years, NASA has spent an estimated $1.3 billion to remedy the foam problem. When asked about the foam concern, NASA Associate Administrator Bill Gerstenmaier said, \"We're about the same risk as we were before ... I don't think we're taking any additional risks.\" Officials have said that they expect foam to fall during the launch though. A few senior NASA safety and technical officers have their voiced opposition to the launch, claiming that they need more time to work on the foam-shedding problem. Foam debris coming loose was the cause of the Columbia disaster in 2003. \nIt is widely expected that another major problem with the launch would lead to the entire NASA fleet being grounded. A grounded fleet, in turn, will put the $100 billion International Space Station in a difficult situation, since the shuttle has been the major means of delivering supplies to it. \nThis mission is to be one of the last few flights of the space shuttle Discovery, which is set to retire in 2010."}

The incident was not broadcast on television but was streamed across the Internet.\nThe Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) are investigating the incident to determine if a breach of Australian online content laws occurred. The show's website streams footage from the house over the Internet 24 hours a day to subscribers aged 18 and over.\nSenator Coonan assured the public that the incident would not be broadcast on television. \"I have sought and obtained an undertaking from Channel 10 that they will not broadcast or promote this incident. However, prior to this undertaking, footage of the incident had already been streamed on the Internet to a limited audience via a paid service which is restricted to subscribers over the age of 18,\" she said.\nSenator Coonan said the ACMA would investigate the Internet broadcast and hand down a report today. Under the Australian Broadcasting Services Act, 1992, it is illegal for content which would be refused classification or given a rating of X18+ to be broadcast via the Internet. \nThe communications minister said she was also concerned that media outlets provided access to footage of the incident on their websites. \"I have asked that AMCA also assess this distribution of the material, and I have written to the media outlets in question this afternoon requesting that they immediately remove the material pending ACMA's findings,\" she said.\nDespite Channel Ten being barred from showing the footage, both Channel 7 and Channel 9 have aired footage of the incident.\nForum users on the Big Brother fan site - Behind Big Brother seem to be split on the incident. Forum users said they thought the media had hyped the incident. \"The way it was described in the papers I pictured Camilla really being pinned down and struggling with Ashley having his way with her. In reality it was much more light-hearted and foreshadowed before it occurred. If that happened to me I wouldn't class that as sexual assault, but maybe a little annoyed!\" they said.\nAnother user said that the behaviour was unacceptable. \"I've seen it and I still think it is unacceptable behaviour. I don't care how much she was laughing before and after. Young girls need to know that that is not acceptable, they don't have to laugh along with it if their mates are doing it to them.\" they said."}

Around 700,000 people have been affected by the power cuts.\nWater supplies have also been badly hit as not all water pumps can continue to work normally, and there is a lack of gasoline and other fuels, according to the Swiss government.\nIn response to the situation, the Swiss government has earmarked one million Swiss Francs for essential medical supplies for the civilian population in Gaza.\nSwitzerland also gave one million Swiss Francs for medicines in June 2006 through the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC).\nA Swiss expert has been deployed to Gaza to ensure the smooth running of the humanitarian operations."}

The tests were criticised by officials from several countries, particularly Japan, Republic of Korea (South Korea) and the United States. The UN Security Council held a closed meeting today to discuss the developments.\nA North Korean foreign ministry official, Lee Byong Dok, acknowledged the tests while speaking to reporters in Pyongyang. Japan's NHK television quoted the official as saying, \"This is an issue of national sovereignty, and other countries do not have the right to judge. We are not bound by any agreement regarding missiles.\" North Korean media made no mention of the launches.\nAustralian foreign minister Alexander Downer said Wednesday that \"there could be one or two more\" launches of short or medium-ranged missiles.\nMajor South Korean newspaper reported Thursday that Pyongyang got three or four missiles on launch pads. The missiles are thought to be short- or medium-range.\nThe missile launches comes five days after US president George W Bush, after talks with Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi, warned North Korea on test-launching a long range missile.\nThe Tests.\nThe first missile was launched at 3:33 a.m. JST Wednesday (1833 UTC Tuesday) and fell into the Sea of Japan, between the Korean peninsula and the Japanese mainland.\nAccording to CNN, at least three missiles were launched including a Taepodong-2, which failed (or was aborted) in less than a minute. The Taepodong-2 is an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) with an estimated range of up to 6,000 km (3,730 miles). This would bring parts of the United States like Alaska and Hawaii within striking range of the missile. The ability to achieve this range has so far not been demonstrated in a test.\nA fourth short-range missile was launched at 7:12 a.m. JST (2212 UTC), according to CNN.\nContrary to information given by US officials, Russia says that Pyongyang launched as many as ten missiles yesterday. This was also earlier reported by the South Korean agency Yonhap.\nThe launch of the seventh missile was reported by South Korean and Japanese officials on Wednesday. Media reports said the latest launch was at 17:22 JST(8:22 UTC). The missile landed six minutes after the launch according to Japan's Kyodo News agency.\nTwo of the missiles were launched from a site other than the one intelligence officials have watched for weeks ahead of a possible long-range missile test, a senior United States State Department official said. Two senior U.S. State Department officials said on Tuesday that fuel trucks had departed the site where the Taepodong-2 sits on a launching pad, indicating that a test may occur in the near future.\nThe North Korean removal of the fuel trucks and other auxiliary equipment meant the North Koreans may have finished fueling the missile, said the officials, who did not want to be named because of the sensitivity of the information. Should the North Koreans have completed the fueling \"all they would need to do now is press the button,\" one source said.\nReactions.\nThe test launches were criticised by many countries and led to an emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council the day after the initial launches. \nThe US National Security Advisor Stephen Hadley called the test launches \"provocative behaviour\" and confirmed that the Taepodong-2 went down just 35 seconds after being launched.\n\"It's the Fourth of July, and they know we are watching and they like to play with us,\" said one senior US official, who has followed the North Korean program for years.\nJapanese and South Korean military have been placed on high alert following the tests. The Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi said that continued talks are needed to defuse the current standoff, adding \"We need both pressure and dialogue, ... There will be no solution without dialogue.\"\nNORAD was put on heightened alert in the past two weeks and the U.S. Missile Defense Agency told CNN that two missiles for interception of ballistic missiles were activated in California prior to test launches.\nThe South Korean Senior Security Secretary, Suh Choo-Suk said that the tests have deepened North Korea's isolation and called for a halt to the \"provocative activity\" and a return to the six-party talks and international efforts for nuclear non-proliferation, adding \"North Korea should be held responsible for all the consequences.\"\nIn a closed meeting today Japan, Britain and the United States prepared a UN resolution that demanded that all nations withhold technology, goods and funding that potentially could be used for North Korea's missile program. It also called on the North Korea to immediately stop the development, testing and deployment of ballistic missiles. No voting on the resolution is expected today.\nJapan announced Wednesday that they would suspend charter flights between the two countries as well has bringing a ferry service to a six-months halt. This means that the only passenger and trade link would be closed for half a year. The country is also considering a call for sanctions through the UN.\nThe South Korea has said that that it will withhold 500,000 tons of rice and 100,000 tons of fertilizer aid to their northern neighbours.\nThe United States, the Republic of Korea and Japan have stressed that the test launches will not bring an end to any diplomatic negotiations.\nChina, the North Korea's closest ally, called the tests \"regrettable\", but indicated that they would favor a more lenient UN statement. However, they did not defend the launches in the UN meeting on Wednesday.\nStocks and currencies fell in Asia after the test launches, but investors considered it a short-term impact based on experiences from previous North Korean launches.

Although an FBI affidavit (based on soldiers' accounts) estimated her age to be 25, Reuters obtained documents that gave her date of birth as August 19, 1991. The other victims have been identified as Fikhriya Taha, the girl's mother; her father Qassim Hamza, and her younger sister, Hadeel Qassim Hamza. \nThe charges follow a military investigation into the involvement of as many as five soldiers in the rape and murders committed in the town of Mahmoudiya, 30 km south of Baghdad, on March 12. \nSteven D. Green, a 21-year-old former Army private first class in the 101st Airborne Division, appeared in a federal magistrate's courtroom in Charlotte on Monday. FBI agents had arrested Green on Friday and he is being held in Charlotte without bond pending a transfer to Louisville, Kentucky. He was honorably discharged from the Army in May 2006 because of an alleged \"personality disorder.\"\nIn an affidavit, FBI special agent Gregor J. Ahlers said Green and three other soldiers from the 101st's 502nd Infantry Regiment were on duty at a traffic checkpoint when they conspired to rape the female who lived nearby.\nAccording to witness testimony in the affidavit, the soldiers changed their clothes before going to the victims' home to avoid detection. Green took three members of the family - an adult male and female, and a girl estimated to be 5 years old\u2014into a bedroom. Shots were heard from inside the bedroom.\n\"Green came to the bedroom door and told everyone, 'I just killed them, all are dead,'\" Ahlers wrote in the affidavit.\nThe affidavit is based on interviews conducted by the FBI and investigators at Fort Campbell with soldiers assigned to Green's platoon. One of the soldiers said he witnessed Green and another soldier rape the girl.\n\"After the rape, (the soldier) witnessed Green shoot the woman in the head two-to-three times,\" the affidavit said.\nU.S. officials and others had previously claimed the Iraqi family was killed in sectarian violence. Abeer Hamza's uncle, Ahmed Taha, told AP Television News that the family had believed insurgents had carried out the killings until the US military made public its investigation last week.\n\"Some said it was insurgents, and in fact, we ruled out the American troops,\" Taha said.\nResponse.\nThe news of the killings and rape was met with a wave of anger in parts of Iraq and the Iraqi government directed at the nature of the current US military presence. \"We believe that the immunity given to members of coalition forces encouraged them to commit such crimes in cold blood (and) that makes it necessary to review it,\" was the opinion of Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki during a visit to Kuwait, July 7.\nOne Baghdad resident, Hussein al-Shimmari, said that the incident \"shows the barbaric and aggressive nature of Americans.\" The Americans themselves claim they are in Iraq to help the government protect its democracy and are reported to have reviewed the way soldiers deal with Iraqi citizens. \nGen. George W. Casey Jr., commander of U.S. forces in Iraq and Zalmay Khalilzad, ambassador to Iraq, issued a joint apology Thursday. \"We understand this is painful, confusing and disturbing,\" they said, \"not only to the family who lost a loved one, but to the Iraqi people as a whole.\""}

With the clock on 119 minutes Fabio Grosso, found in the area by Pirlo, circled a left foot shot across him just inside the far post.\nJust two minutes later, Alessandro Del Piero got Italy's second with the last kick of the game when he clipped high past Lehmann's left hand at the end of a fast break-away with Alberto Gilardino.\nLehmann had the busier match and made eight saves while Gianluigi Buffon was troubled by two. The Arsenal goalkeeper had also to deal with twelve corner kicks, many of which he plucked easily from the Italian heads.\nGermany played the game without ball winner Torsten Frings, whom FIFA had suspended from the match for a punch thrown in a melee after the penalty shootout in the quarter-final against Argentina. \nIn the 90 minutes the better chances fell to Germany. On half an hour Bernd Schneider was free on goal but did not keep his shot down. After an hour Lukas Podolski, right of goal, spun and shot but was denied by Gianluigi Buffon.\nThe Italian defence had not conceded a goal for four games, and were to go on to record a fifth shut out in six games at the World Cup finals. \nThe statistics suggest Italy were the most attacking side in the match with eight more corners, nine more offsides and 14 per cent more ball possession than their opponents.\nItaly played overtime with a vigorous intent to win and nearly cracked the Germans in the first two minutes. Gilardino cut back from the goal line and got away a sneaky near post shot but it bounced off the inside of Lehmann's left post. Gianluca Zambrotta drove one from the edge of the area but was denied by Lehmann's crossbar.\nThe Germans who had gone the full 120 minutes in their last game appeared the more tired team but had a chance to go 1-0 in front. Lukas Podolski was found unmarked at the near post, but his header from ten yards was about ten yards wide.\nItaly had an emotional history of penalty kick shootout losses at the World Cup, including a defeat in the 1994 World Cup final, but Marcello Lippi's team's persistence was eventually rewarded. There were no penalties to overcome.

According to Sondhi Limthongkul's ThaiDay, the action seeking the dissolution of five parties was delivered by truck and consisted of over 120,000 pages of legal citations.\nBoth the Thai Rak Thai party making up the caretaker government and the main opposition Democrats are named. The allegations centre on claims that Thai Rak Thai paid minor parties to participate where seats would otherwise be unopposed, and that the Democrats may have bribed parties to claim that they had been paid by Thai Rak Thai.\nThailand's prolonged political crisis originally stemmed from repeated corruption allegations against the Prime Minister, Thaksin Shinawatra. An April 2nd snap election apparently intended to cement the ruling party's position and dismiss critics as unrepresentative backfired when the three main opposition parties announced a boycott. This left many seats unopposed, particularly in the country's troubled Muslim south. With Thai Rak Thai standing alone in strong Democrat territory, a grassroots abstention campaign left many seats empty when they failed to garner the constitutionally required 20% of eligible votes.\nAmongst all the political posturing, and allegations that the Election Commission had unduly favoured the ruling party, claims that there had been irregularities surfaced. Thai Rak Thai was accused of having paid minor parties to circumvent the 20% rule by offering token opposition. The claims were brought before the Election Commission who eventually handed the case over to the Attorney General without offering any recommendation. The commission's sub-committee that prepared the report had recommended the dissolution of Thai Rak Thai.\nAt present it is unclear if the political crisis will be resolved through the country's legal system prior to the upcoming October election rerun. The volume of evidence may leave the Constitutional Court unable to agree on a ruling prior to the election."}

Everything points to human error.\"\nOn board of the aircraft followed two Russian pilots - one of them still receiving formation - and an Portuguese pilot that was observing the operations.\nTwo years ago, the Italian authorities tested the Beriev in the same mission type. Having the Portuguese Government sent observers to evaluate the performance of the aircraft. However, some limitations were found in the performing of the Russian aircraft in Italy's wildfire scenarios. Having the Italian Civil Protection reached the conclusion that the Beriev 200 is not prepared to operate in mountainous terrain."}

For Italy and France Gennaro Gattuso and Claude Makelele tackled hard. \nHowever; both creative midfield stars made important contributions to the only goals of the game. Zidane converted a chipped penalty after five minutes while Pirlo's magnificent corner, a quarter of an hour later, thundered into the net off Marco Materazzi's head.\nMaterazzi had previously conceded the penalty when he tapped Florent Malouda on his ankle as he ran past him in the penalty area.\nIn the first half Italy's left and right defensive backs Gianluca Zambrotta and Fabio Grosso penetrated down the French flanks. But after the break France came out the strongest. The flow of the game was disrupted when Patrick Viera pulled-up injured and Marcello Lippi made two substitutions on the hour. A deadlock resulted as teams tired and individuals battled for every ball without thinking too hard about constructing team attacks.\nMaterazzi was never far from the action in the final and though Italy had 55 percent of ball possession was one of the busier players on the pitch. France were slightly more potent offensively with 13 shots - out-shooting the Azzurri by eight attempts.\nIn Extra Time France came closest to a goal - Zidane, unmarked, headed to goal from 12 yards but was tipped over one-handed by Gianluigi Buffon. \nZidane's next contribution to the game was not so graceful and appeared to be sparked by the close marking of the ubiquitous Materazzi. After a verbal altercation the 34-year-old turned around and drove his head violently into the Italian's upper chest. \nMaterazzi was knocked backwards on the floor but the incident occurred off the ball and was not immediately noticed by the referee or his assistants. Buffon soon ran out of his penalty area to an assistant referee and the game was stopped. \nHoracio Elizondo ran to the touchline to consult with officials and returned waving a red card for the violent conduct of Zidane. It is likely FIFA used information from fourth and fifth official to confirm the decision. However FIFA denied video evidence claims alleged by France team's coach Raymond Domenech.\nThe headbutt and red card was Zidane's last action in football as he had said he would retire after the tournament.\nA penalty shootout was necessary to decide the winner.

Several sources have reported that a systematic police crackdown on people participating in alternative meetings (a Libertarian Forum and the Russian Social Forum) and critical of the official meeting has begun almost a week prior to the summit. Estimates range from dozens to one or two hundred arrests and detentions.\nFor the past several years, especially since the 27th G8 summit in 2001 in Genoa, the G8 summits of the leaders of seven of the world's richest industrialised countries and of Russia have been regularly met by popular protests by critics who assert that members of G8 are responsible for global issues such as global warming due to carbon dioxide emission, poverty in Africa and developing countries due to debt crisis and unfair trade policy, exacerbating the AIDS crisis by medicine patent policy and other problems that are related to globalization. These protests have been met by massive numbers of arrests and police violence, on some occasions.\nIn contrast to previous G8 meetings, this time arrests have been taking place a week before the official meeting itself has started. At least 23-25 human rights activists and political activists, including two German citizens, have been detained by police in Moscow, St Petersburg and other cities in Russia since 7 July. Many of them have been sentenced to ten days' imprisonment, enough to prevent them from participation in political protests until the end of the official summit.\nSome sources claim that the true detention rate may be much higher, such as an unconfirmed report attributed to the Siberian Confederation of Labour (\u0421\u0438\u0431\u0438\u0440\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u041a\u043e\u043d\u0444\u0435\u0434\u0435\u0440\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0438 \u0422\u0440\u0443\u0434\u0430) claiming 200 arrests. The activists' legal team claims that more than 100 arrests and detainments have occurred.\nDiscussions on global energy issues and other themes have started at the Libertarian Forum despite the arrests, and the Russian Social Forum is expected to start on schedule on 13 July, followed by the official G8 meeting on 15-17 July. Permission to carry out a street demonstration by the Russian Social Forum has been refused by the authorities.\nRussian authorities say that demonstrations are permitted, but only in the location set aside for them - a sports stadium about 25 km (16 miles) from the Constantine Palace, which will house the summit. The Russian Deputy Interior Minister Alexander Chekalin said that allegations of harassment were \"from the realms of supposition\". \n\"The police's actions are commensurate with the situation at hand. The situation demands particular measures, sometimes intensified. Sometimes it demands that we visit a family in their apartment,\" He said."}

This decision follows months of public debate and controversy over the proposal. Many Britons have argued for greater use of renewable energy supplies, but the government has said that even with a big increase in investment, renewable sources will not meet all of the UK's additional energy demands. It is expected that 25 GW of additional generating capacity will be required over the next two decades, partly as compensation for old nuclear stations which will be closed down. This additional capacity must be met while reducing overall greenhouse gas emission as per the .\nThe government also announced big increases in spending on renewable energy research and for the construction of onshore wind farms. It is claimed that 20% of energy will be produced from renewables by 2020, and if there are new breakthroughs in renewable energy science this figure may be increased further. Philip Wolfe of the Renewable Energy Association (REA) told the BBC \"The government has seen the light on renewables. The energy review supports what we and many others have been consistently saying - that renewables, energy efficiency and decentralised systems are the strongest prospects for secure and sustainable energy supplies.\" \nThe new nuclear plants will cost 400-500 million UK pounds (700-900 million US dollars) and will generate 1.5 to 2 GW of power each. These will provide the baseline amount of additional power should there be a lack of success in new areas of renewable energy research. The private sector will initiate, fund, construct and operate the new nuclear plants and will cover the full cost of decommissioning and their full share of long-term waste management costs. The Government proposes to address potential barriers to new nuclear stations, but says it will not provide any taxpayer money for the nuclear industry - tax investment will only be put into renewable energy research. This approach is similar to the successful approach adopted in the USA. It contrasts with early UK nuclear power development, where individual power plants or small groups of plants were planned and built by separate publicly funded research and engineering groups, but there was poor planning of nationwide issues such as waste management. Critics argue that the government has only put the nuclear option on the table as it is privately run and does not require government investment, whereas increasing renewable energy production would cost taxpayer money.\nThe review also discusses energy self-sufficiency, and points out that the increase in renewable energy to 20% of the total will improve the UK's self sufficiency. No mention is made of opening uranium mines in the (or reopening uranium mines) in order to make the UK self-sufficient in uranium, something which in 1980.\nSome critics were disappointed that the review had little discussion of the reduction of emissions from transport, a sector which gives a larger contribution to the total UK emissions than electricity generation. This may relate to the high costs associated with significant reductions in emissions in the transport sector."}

The soldiers were taken Wednesday following an attack by Hezbollah, a Lebanese militia, that had made an incursion into Israel. \nThree Israeli soldiers died and eleven were wounded when army transports patrolling at the Israeli-Lebanese border were attacked on Wednesday morning, near the Israeli village of Zar'it. Hezbollah also fired mortars and long-range rockets at the Israeli town of Shlomi and nearby communities. Six Israeli civilians were injured by the artillery fire.\nAfter the attack two soldiers were found to be missing. Israeli troops and tanks then entered southern Lebanon, having claimed the soldiers were kidnapped. Following the incursion, five more soldiers were killed, four of them when an Israeli tank hit a mine. Hezbollah said one of its members died.\nThe Israeli air-force targeted several roads, bridges and Hezbollah outposts in an attempt to stop militants from moving the soldiers, Israel said. Two civilians were killed in an air raid on one of the bridges, while 23 others have been injured. Israeli artillery and gunboats also attacked other targets on Lebanese soil.\nLater, Hezbollah said they had destroyed an Israeli tank which had crossed the border into Lebanon.\nEhud Olmert, Israel's Prime Minister, blamed the attack on the Lebanese government calling it \"an act of war\" and vowed to deliver a \"very painful and far-reaching\" response. Israel Defense Forces Chief of Staff Dan Halutz told Israel's Channel 10 that if the soldiers are not returned \"we will turn Lebanon's clock back 20 years\".\nHezbollah Secretary-General, Sheik Hassan Nasrallah, hailed what he called the capture of the two soldiers calling them \"our natural, only and logical right\". He also said that the soldiers were taken to \"a far away place\" and that the only way to get them back was through an exchange with Lebanese and other Arab prisoners in Israeli jails.\nThe Israeli cabinet is in an emergency meeting and has yet to make an official statement about the situation. PM Ehud Olmert said previously that swapping of prisoners is not an option.\nHezbollah's announcement of their captures led to celebration scenes in a Hezbollah-strong suburb in Beirut with firing of guns in the air and handing out candy to children.\nThe Lebanese government issued a statement after an emergency meeting of the cabinet saying that it was not informed of the intentions of Hezbollah and that it does not endorse the group's actions. Prime Minister Fouad Siniora was quoted as saying that \"the government was not aware of and does not take responsibility for, nor endorses what happened on the international border\". \nHezbollah currently has two sitting members on the Lebanese government's ruling coalition.\nThe view recognized by the United States is one that condemned the attacks, but acknowledged that Lebanon had little say over Hezbollah in the south. The White House said the militant group's violent actions were supported by Iran and Syria.\nIsrael has filed a complaint with the United Nations which called for the Security Council to enforce resolutions urging Lebanon to extend its authority throughout its territory and to disarm its militias."}

The case began after \"The News of the World\" printed several pieces in 2004 and 2005, making allegations regarding Mr Sheridan's personal life. The newspaper stands by the articles as true, despite the MSP claiming \u00a3200,000 in damages.\nMany of the original articles centre around the former market researcher Helen Allison, who claims that, in 2002, she was invited to a Glasgow hotel by a friend to attend a \"VIP party.\" Upon arrival, she was taken up to a suite where she saw Tommy Sheridan \"having sex with a female at the bottom of a bed and another man sitting at the side of the bed putting a condom on.\" It was alleged by \"The News of the World\" that this woman was a prostitute.

No group has so far claimed responsibility for the attacks. Indian authorities have said that the Kashmiri militant group Lashkar-e-Toiba (LeT) may be involved. An LeT spokesman has denied any involvement. \nThe day after the blast, schools, colleges and offices functioned normally in Mumbai and the commuter train service targeted in the bombings was operational. Many commuters rode the trains to work, though their numbers were smaller than usual. The Bombay Stock Exchange, located in the city shrugged off the bombings, with the BSE SENSEX gaining 3 percent on opening, calming fears that economic confidence will be undermined by the blasts. \nInvestigation underway.\nThe Maharashtra state government has announced a reward of Rs. 25,000,000 (about US $55,000) for information leading to the arrest of the perpetrators. A number of people, reported to be 350 have been detained for interrogation, but no arrests have been made. Police are working on preparing sketches of possible suspects, news reports say.\nThe \"Times of India\" newspaper reported that Indian intelligence officials believe that Lashkar-e-Toiba and the banned Students Islamic Movement of India were behind the blasts. The Home Ministry confirmed the involvement of Students Islamic Movement of India. The Chief Secretary to the Maharashtra state government, D K Shankaran told Reuters news agency \"So far it looks like there was a substantial involvement of Lashkar-e-Toiba with local support,\".\nP.S. Pasricha, director-general of police in Maharashtra, speaking to reporters, said that while it was too early to say who is responsible for the attacks, the coordinated explosions were in the style of Lashkar-e-Toiba (LeT), which has been blamed for carrying out similar attacks before. Indian authorities have accused Kashmiri militant groups such as the Lashkar, Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) and the Hizb-ul-Mujahideen of attacks on civilians before. The Mumbai underworld is another potential suspect - a series of bombings in Mumbai in 1993 which killed 250 people are believed to have been planned by a Mafia don Dawood Ibrahim. India alleges that Ibrahim lives in Pakistan and has long maintained that Lashkar-e-Toiba and Jaish-e-Mohammed have been trained and supported by Pakistan in the past.\nSpokesmen for the Lashkar-e-Toiba and Hizb-ul-Mujahideen have denied any role in the attacks. The LeT spokesman said that LeT could \"feel the pain of the victims\" of the attacks as the people of Kashmir have been suffering \"the same pain for the last 17 years at the hands of the Indian security forces\", adding that an \"independent investigation should be carried out... so that the people behind the attack can be exposed\". \n\"Attacks on civilians are not part of our manifesto. We never carried out such attacks nor will allow anyone to do so,\" said Ehsan Elahi, spokesman for the Hizb-ul-Mujahideen.\nInternational condemnation.\nThe attacks have been condemned by a number of countries around the world. India's neighbours Pakistan, and Afghanistan; the UK, France, Italy and the EU; Spain, which witnessed a similar attack in 2004; South Africa, the United States, Australia and the UN Secretary General amongst others have spoken out against the attacks. \nA statement released by Pakistan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs condemned the attacks, saying \"Terrorism is a bane of our times and it must be condemned, rejected and countered effectively and comprehensively.\" \nIndia faults Pakistan Foreign Secretary statement.\nThe Pakistani Foreign Minister Khurshid Mehmood Kasuri, after condemning the attack, noted that not much progress has been made on Kashmir problem, he said, \"incremental approach is good but now we must tackle real issues. And this is the best way of tackling extremism in South Asia\". \nIndia took exception to this remark. External Affairs Ministry spokesman Navtej Sarna described the statement as \u2018appalling\u2019, saying Mr Kasuri\u2019s \u201cremarks appear to suggest that Pakistan will cooperate with India against the scourge of cross-border terrorism and terrorist violence only if such so-called disputes are resolved,\u201d. \nHe urged Pakistan to \"dismantle the infrastructure of terrorism\" \non territory under its control and act in the spirit of the joint statement reached between the two countries on January 6, 2004.\nForeign Secretary Shyam Saran told a news channel on Wednesday that India may review some of the confidence building measures it is jointly developing with Pakistan, following the attacks. A meeting between Mr. Saran and his Pakistani counterpart, scheduled to take place on July 20-21, is also under question, with the External Affairs Ministry spokesman Navtej Sarna failing to make any announcement regarding the date.\nPakistan's foreign ministry rejected these accusations in a statement, saying Mr Kasuri's remarks had been misreported and denying he had drawn a link between the bombings and the Kashmir dispute. and said that Pakistan was \"in the forefront of international efforts to fight [the] menace\" of terrorism.\nPrime Minister addresses nation.\nIn an address to the nation, the Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh expressed his condolences to the victims of the attacks and to their families, saying that India stands by the people of Mumbai and Srinagar (where 8 people were killed in a grenade attack yesterday) \"in this hour of grief\". \"My heart goes out to those who have lost their loved ones\", he said. \nHe acknowledged the \"courage and humanism\" shown in the response to the attacks and the efforts of the emergency and service personnel and the public in the aftermath of the tragedy. \nSaying that Mumbai is the symbol of a united, inclusive India, he said that India will \"continue to walk tall, and with confidence despite the attack\".\nThe Union Home minister Shivraj Patil, the Congress party chief Sonia Gandhi and Railway Minister Laloo Prasad Yadav visited Matunga Road railway station late yesterday. Mr Patil appealed for unity and restraint in responding to the attack. Mr Yadav has announced an ex-gratia compensation of Rs 5,00,000 (US $11,000) to the families of the dead and promised jobs in the railways for the families who have lost earning members in the bombings.\nOpposition BJP calls for tougher anti-terrorism measures.\nThe Leader of the Opposition L K Advani and President of the Opposition Bharatiya Janata Party Rajnath Singh, who visited the blast sites and the met with the injured, called the bombings \"an attack on India\". \nA resolution adopted by the BJP office-bearers criticised the central UPA government, charging that it was sending \"consistent signals that the initiative against terrorism can be traded for votes\". However, Mr. Advani said that \"it \nwas not the time for criticising the government\". He said that the blasts showed up the need for a stringent anti-terrorism law and that the authorities must not give an impression that they are willing to compromise national security. \nIn 2004, The UPA government had repealed such a law, the Prevention of Terrorist Activities Act enacted by the previous BJP-led government."}

We intend to maintain and build the valuable CHUM brands and develop more opportunities for Canadian programming.\" He added that CTV and Citytv will remain separate networks and \"will maintain separate and independent news divisions in order to ensure a continued diversity and competition in news coverage.\"\nIn a separate release, CHUM announced it would be cutting 281 jobs at its stations across the country, particularly at its Citytv stations in western Canada. Effectively immediately, evening newscasts at CKVU-TV Vancouver, CKEM-TV Edmonton, CKAL-TV Calgary and CHMI-TV in the Winnipeg market are being eliminated, with plans for a new newsmagazine tentatively titled \"In Your City\" at the three Prairie stations, and more resources being put into each station's local version of Breakfast Television. Less drastic changes are planned for its A-Channel stations in smaller markets. The company said these changes will result \"in a significant reduction in staffing and operating costs.\"\nThe companies said that they expect to sell CHUM's A-Channel stations, as well as Alberta educational broadcaster Access, to third parties, despite CTV's historical ties to several of them. Many of the A-Channel stations were originally acquired by CHUM from Baton Broadcasting, the predecessor of Bell Globemedia, in 1997, as part of a trade that sent CHUM's ATV and ASN assets in Atlantic Canada to Baton and allowed Baton to acquire the CTV network itself.\nDespite CHUM's ownership of MuchMusic and CTV's recent launch of MTV Canada, the companies claim their specialty channels are \"complementary\" and did not indicate any sale plans.\nBell Globemedia is currently majority-owned by BCE Inc. but is awaiting regulatory approval for a restructuring involving the Ontario Teachers Pension Plan, Torstar Corp., and the Thomson family. In the interim, the takeover offer will be made by a new company owned by the proposed new shareholder structure."}

The document was released to counter a Japanese alternative, which was written in response to last week's Taepodong-2 missile tests. This Sino-Russian version, however, removes sections which could advocate military action against Pyongyang. \nThe move comes after a number of Chinese requests this week to revise the original Japanese version, claiming that tensions in the region would increase if it were to be adopted. As a result, Chinese diplomats have been instructed to veto the initial document, which advocates much stronger sanctions against North Korea than neighbours Russia and China would have felt comfortable with. \nThe two nations presented their revised resolution to the United Nations this afternoon. After reviewing a draft copy - which was released to the Associated Press - several influential nations, including the United States and the United Kingdom, have reaffirmed their support for Japan's initial version.\nBoth Russia and China, who share a border with the nation, have been placed in a difficult position by last week's missile tests. Both countries have relatively positive relations with North Korea but their commitment to the international community - mainly the UN Security Council - has led to an impartial stance on this issue. The publishing of this \"counter-resolution\" is the first active move the two nations have made against the North since the tests, who still approve of sanctions but describe Japan's proposed extensive restrictions as \"over-reacting.\"\nJapan and the United States have announced tonight that they still intend to put their first resolution to a vote, despite the threat of a veto by China and possibly Russia. A Japanese diplomat has said that the Sino-Russian reworking was \"a step in the right direction\" but lacked decisive wording on important issues. The use of weaker language - namely asking instead of demanding - has also been criticised.\nSouth Korea has not commented directly on the new resolution, but has instead urged North Korea to return to the Six-Party Talks, which are seen to be a key step forward in ensuring diplomacy between the nation and its democratic peers."}

Rockets were fired from Lebanon and landed on the Israeli side of the border, Thursday. Israel called their military action \"Operation Just Reward\".\nThe clashes follow a Hezbollah raid into Israel which they called \"Truthful Promise\" in which Hezbollah claimed to have captured two Israeli soldiers. Israel said the men were kidnapped.\nIsraeli aircraft launched missiles at Beirut international airport and damaged runways and fuel stores. Additional targets were attacked, including 18 bridges, and a Hezbollah run TV station, Al-Manar, which continued to broadcast after being targeted, but later went partially off air. \n45 Lebanese civilians and two soldiers were reported killed as a result of Israeli overnight raids and 103 people were injured. In some areas Israeli planes had dropped leaflets to warn residents to stay away from Hezbollah buildings.\nOver 100 rockets were fired from Lebanon towards northern Israel Thursday, which the Israeli Army says are the acts of Hezbollah. Two Israeli civilians were reported killed over 100 injured.\nThe Lebanese road communications network was targeted: 18 bridges were damaged and early on Friday the highway linking Beirut and Damascus was hit by five Israeli missiles. The highway is the only route out of the country after the airport was shut down. Witnesses said that the road was free from traffic when the missiles hit.\nIn a television interview, Wednesday July 12, Brigadier Gen. Dan Halutz had told Israel's Channel 10 that if the Israeli soldiers were not returned Israel would \"turn Lebanon's clock back 20 years\". He also said of Lebanon \"nothing is safe.\"\nLebanon.\nBeirut International Airport.\nIsraeli airforce attacked Beirut Rafic Hariri International Airport in the Lebanese capital twice on Thursday. The first airstrike hit the airport runways. The second strike, which took place after Haifia in Israel was hit by two rockets, destroyed fuel tanks at the airport. The attacks forced cancellation of all flights to and from the airport and the closure of the facility, police and airport officials said.\nOther Israeli actions.\n\"Notes\"\nNorthern Israel.\nIsrael claims that at least two civilians died and others injured as over 100 rockets, including the Katyusha and Thunder 1, landed in northern Israel, including Haifia on Thursday.

And we urge all those countries with influence over Hezbollah and Hamas to play their part,\" said Foreign Secretary Margaret Beckett. But \"while Israel is entitled to do what is required to protect its security, it should do so in a way which does not escalate the situation and which is proportionate and measured, conforms to international law, and avoids civilian deaths and suffering.\"\n While a Whitehouse spokesman said America \"recognised Israel's right to defend itself\", U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice asked Israel to be more restrained. Rice also told Syria to get Hezbollah to stop their attacks on Israel. \n Lebanese ministers want a ceasefire with Israel. \n The Arab League want an emergency meeting to discuss the Israeli-Lebanon crisis. Yemen asked for an official Arab summit. \"We are concerned about an escalation,\" said an Arab League official.\n Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said that an Israeli strike on Syria would be considered \"attacking the whole Islamic world and this regime will receive a very fierce response\".\nIn related news, the United States vetoed a UN condemnation of Israel on Thursday. The draft vetoed was proposed by Qatar and demanded that Israel pulled back its forces from the Gaza Strip. \nEconomic impact.\nThe turmoil in the Middle East has led to record high prices for oil, which is now trading at $76.70 a barrel.\nThe stock market in Tel Aviv closed down 4.3 percent on Thursday. The Shekel has also slipped against the dollar. \nOther international events are also having it say on stock markets worldwide as investors are keeping their eyes on North Korea and Iran's nuclear ambitions in addition to the situation in the Middle East.\nThomas McIntyre at McIntyre, Freedman &amp; Flynn put it this way: \"We're having a complete breakdown in attitude toward the stock market.

Already, two businesses, Skunk Tail Glass and Six Nations Native American Gift Shop have relocated, outside the Elmwood Strip. Don apparel, H.O.D. Tattoo and Mondo Video still remain on Elmwood; however, Mondo Video is planning on moving to a new location. The hotel will be 72 rooms and will cost at least 7 million dollars to build.\n\"We're lovers, not fighters. Our energies should be spent on developing a really wonderful project, not wasted in court. We'll start over with a clean slate and take as much time as necessary to hear people out and end up with a very positive project for the neighborhood,\" said President of Savarino Construction, Sam Savarino.\nThe hotel will not undergo any major changes in its design says Savarino. \"We would anticipate little if any physical change to the plans.\" He also alleges that the issues with the hotel were not with the design or the proposal and also says that the hotel is still right for the intersection. \n\"The perceived problem was with the process, not the proposal itself. We believe this is the right thing to do on that corner,\" added Savarino.\nAccording to the \"Buffalo News\", the projects resubmission is aimed to \"shed the lawsuits\" against the proposal. The \"Buffalo News\" also claims that the Common Council members are all still \"in favor of the project.\" The proposal was unanimously passed by the council on March 21, 2006.\nAttorney Arthur J. Giacalone who represents the plaintiffs, Nancy Pollina and Patricia Morris, who operate Don Apparel (a vintage clothing and collectibles shop at 1119 Elmwood Avenue), Angeline Genovese and Evelyn Bencinich, owners of residences on Granger Place which abut the rear of the proposed site, Nina Freudenheim, a resident of nearby Penhurst Park, and Sandra Girage, the owner of a two-family residence on Forest Avenue less than a hundred feet from the proposed hotel's sole entrance and exit driveway, says that the hotel proposal was \"inappropriately rushed,\" but some council members disagree. Defendants in the lawsuit against the hotel are, Buffalo's Common Council and Planning Board, Mayor of Buffalo, Byron W. Brown, Savarino Construction Services Corporation, Hans J. Mobius and his son Hans S. Mobius owners of the properties at stake, Pano Georgiadis, owner of Pano's Restaurant on Elmwood, and Cendant Corporation, the parent company of Wyndham Hotels, which will be, according to Savarino, the hotel operator. Attorney David State is representing the city, Planning Board, Mayor Byron Brown and the Common Council.\n\"I don't think it was a rush job,\" said Dominic J. Bonifacio Jr., the council's Majority Leader.\nHe also alleges that the only way to make \"it [the hotel] a better project and ease the concerns of some neighbors would be to find a way to provide more parking.\"\nIn an exclusive phone interview with Wikinews, Giacalone states that the lawsuit against the hotel and the city \"will not be moved [withdrawn] unless the Common Council resins their [prior] decisions in passing the proposal.\" Giacalone also says that Savarino has yet to submit any new plans for the proposal to the city. He also says that he \"still plans to represent all plaintiffs\" if they wish to continue with the suit and the use of his services.\nGiacalone rescheduled the preliminary hearing which is \"still in place\" for July 27, 2006. When asked if the properties are still owned by Mobius, Giacalone replied \"yes\" and that according to attorney Bob Knoer, the Lawyer representing Hans Mobius, the owner of the properties that could be demolished, there is \"no contract between Savarino\" and that Mobius \"plans to put the properties back on the market.\" Mobius has not returned phone calls or e-mails and has not yet commented on the situation or the proposal itself. The city denies these claims. \nIn an exclusive phone interview by Wikinews, area councilman Joseph Golombek states that the reason for the resubmission of the proposal was due to \"a mistake in the Planning process\" and that none of the council members have \"indicated that they have changed their opinions on the hotel\" and still remain in favor of the project.\n\"I still think the Hotel is a good idea for that part of Elmwood. For Elmwood to stay strong and vibrant it must continue to grow and adapt to change. It is a different community than it was twenty years ago and will be different in another twenty years. The opponents of the Hotel \nhave the opportunity to challenge it and are doing that. Even though I disagree with them I am glad there is a safety mechanism for people who disagree with government. We need to keep moving forward,\" added Golombek.\nSupporters of the hotel proposal are planning on holding a rally to support the new development. \"WNYmedia.net\" claims that the first rally will be held to support the hotel proposal on July 17, 2006 at 5:00 p.m. on Elmwood and Forest, on the site of the proposed location. According to \"WNYmedia.net\" they \"are tired of the anti development crowd in Western New York.\" They also blast opponents of the hotel proposal calling them \"bananas\" and \"nimbys.\" People opposed to the hotel proposal are planning on \"counter attacking\" with their own protest on the same day and time."}

Since Wednesday, Hezbollah have fired over 300 rockets into towns in northern Israel, killing four civilians and wounding dozens. Hezbollah rockets reached as far south as the port city of Haifa.\nLebanon said on Friday that Israel had launched \"a widespread barbaric aggression\" with the intention of hurting Lebanon. The country urged the United Nations community to stop the military offensive. \"The targets chosen are connected either directly or indirectly with terrorism,\" Israeli Air Force General Ido Nehushtan, said. \nThe Israeli attacks included the southern suburb of Beirut where Israel says Hezbollah has a stronghold. Most roads and bridges leading to the southern suburb of Beirut have been shelled, isolating the suburb from the rest of the country. The attacks came after Israeli planes dropped leaflets on the evening of July 13, warning residents in the mainly Shiite south suburb of impending attacks to Hezbollah property.\nIsrael says Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah, the Hezbollah leader, is also a target. \"Nasrallah has issued his own sentence.\" said Ronnie Bar-On, the Israeli interior minister. The home and headquarters of Hezbollah's spiritual leader Sheik Hassan Nasrallah was hit by Israeli missiles, but Nasrallah and his nearest were unhurt in the attack. Nasrallah said in a televised address after the attack that Hezbollah is ready for an \"open war\" with Israel. \nThis comes after Ehud Olmert said Lebanon had committed an \"act of war\" when Hezbollah attacked Israel.\n\"You wanted an open war and we are ready for an open war\", Nasrallah said in the broadcast. \"You have chosen an all-out war with a nation which ... has the capability, the experience and the courage.\" He continued saying that Lebanon would either surrender or \"have faith in Allah and victory\".\nThe Lebanese Prime Minister Fouad Siniora described the conflict as a \"controlled war\" and called it an opportunity to address the Israel-Palestine conflict.\nFive civilians were killed and at least 50 have been wounded in Lebanon on Friday after Israeli attacks. According to Lebanon, 63 people have been killed and 167 wounded in the country since the raids commenced on Wednesday.\nThe Israeli military and Israel's ambassador to the UN said that the rockets fired into Haifa on Thursday by Hezbollah were manufactured in Iran. Lebanese PM Siniora said that it was puzzling for Hezbollah to perform the attacks unsupported.\nStates worldwide have called for the release of the prisoners and for Israel to exercise restraint, while Lebanon has urged the UN Security Council, which held an emergency meeting on Friday, to pass a ceasefire resolution.\nLebanon's UN envoy, Nouhad Mahmoud, claimed that Israel's attacks on Lebanon \"will not resolve the problem, but will further complicate it. The Security Council meets today in the shadow of a widespread barbaric aggression waged by Israel to this very moment against my nation,\" he said. \"What Israel is undertaking is an act of aggression and devastation aimed at bringing Lebanon to its knees and subverting it by any means.\"\nIsrael's chief of staff, Dan Halutz, said Friday that all three soldiers were alive and in a \"reasonable\" state of health.\nLebanon.\nIsraeli planes targeted a headquarters of Hezbollah in Beirut and destroyed the building. Hezbollah's spiritual leader Sheik Hassan Nasrallah and his family are said to be safe.\nThe tarmac on Beirut International Airport was patched up after being hit several times by the Israeli air force on Thursday. Five airplanes belonging to Middle East Airlines then took off from the airport heading to Cyprus. \nIn addition, a private plane owned by former Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati took off with the former PM onboard. Assurances were given by Fuad Siniora, the Lebanese prime minister, that they would not be attacked. It was reported that the United States had helped broker a no-attack deal. \nHowever, the runways were hit again on Friday some time after the airplanes had taken off. A parking lot near the terminal building was also hit.\nOther targets hit in Lebanon included a fuel tank at the power plant in Jiyyeh. Power shortages have been reported. The Hezbollah radio station al-Nour was targeted by an Israeli strike, but continued broadcasting. Also, a road between Haboush and Iqlion el Tufah was hit.\nA total of 18 targets claimed by Israel to be Hezbollah sites have been hit by air and sea launched missiles. The Israeli military said they attacked Hezbollah outposts in south Lebanon, a facility for weapons-storage and three gas stations south of Sidon.\nFive explosions were reported in Beirut late Friday.\nUp to 17 000 Lebanese civilians have been escaping the country bound for Syria through the Masnaa crossing. Even though the main road between Beirut and Damascus have been repeatedly targeted by Israel in the last 24 hours, that didn't hinder people as they arrived on foot and by car. \"We have become refugees\", a woman said on her way crossing the border. The two countries have eased border crossing procedures and deployed extra staff.\nAn Israeli navy ship was severely damaged after being hit by an explosives-packed UAV launched by Hezbollah. The ship was 16 km from the Lebanese coast when it was hit. This is a new, previously unused tactic by the militant group. They have however tested such drones twice in recent years. Four Israeli sailors were reportedly being searched for after the attack.\nThe strike on the ship was seemingly timed with Hezbollah leader Nasrallah's broadcast.

The teams were accused of rigging matches by selecting referees, while players, including Italy's World Cup-winning goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon, have also been charged of illegally gambling on matches.\nPunishments.\nThe results were published at around 20:00 local time on July 14, 2006 and shown live on Italian television. The FIGC (Italian Football Federation) had originally called for all four clubs involved, AC Milan, Juventus, Lazio and Fiorentina to be thrown out of Serie A, with Juventus demoted two divisions into Serie C1.\nJuventus suffered the biggest punishment. They were demoted into Italy's second division, Serie B and will start the 2006-07 season with a thirty-point deduction. They were also stripped of their league titles, or \"Scudettos\", they had won in 2004-05 and 2005-06. President Giovanni Cobolli Gigli stated: \"This verdict is unheard of. We could have expected relegation to the second division but to be also handed a 30-point deduction is almost like relegation to the third division.\"\nFiorentina have also been relegated to Serie B, and will have twelve-point deduction. Lazio will join Juventus and Fiorentina in Serie B next season and will have a seven-point deduction.\nAC Milan have avoided relegation but will start next season with minus fifteen points. They have also had 44 points deducted from their total in the 2005-06 season to put them out of the Champions League and UEFA Cup qualification places.\nSeveral officials, but no players, from each club has also been suspended from football, including now ex-general manager Luciano Moggi and ex-chief executive Antonio Giraudo, both of Juventus, who have been banned for five years. The other three clubs have also had board members suspended for between one and four years.\nAll four sides have been barred from playing in European competitions next season and will have up to three days to appeal. UEFA have given the FIGC a deadline of 25 July to finalise their European qualifying teams\nConsequences.\nThe results of the match-fixing trial could have huge consequences on football in the whole of Europe, let alone Italy. Thirteen of Italy's squad which had won the World Cup less than a week before play their club football for one of the accused teams and the rulings could spark a massive sell-out. 12 Juventus players went to the World Cup, including five for Italy. AC Milan also had thirteen players at the World Cup.\nThe suspensions mean that a total rehaul of Italy's European qualifiers has been made. Internazionale and Roma will qualify for the Champions League Group Stages, with Palermo and Chievo going into the Third Qualifying Round. Livorno, Empoli and Parma will all qualify for the UEFA Cup first round.\nThe original relegated trio of Messina, Lecce and Treviso have all been reprieved and will play in Serie A next season as another consequence of the scandal."}

Israel has also reportedly served Syria with a 72 hour ultimatum to stop the Hezbollah attacks on northern Israel and secure the release of two captured Israeli soldiers.\nIsrael said Saturday that Hezbollah fired two radar-guided, at an Israeli warship on Friday. Israel earlier said that the ship was hit by an explosives-laden drone. The ship, , was in Lebanese waters near Beirut Friday when it was hit. The first rocket was said to miss and the second hit the helicopter deck. Four Israeli sailors were reported missing, two later confirmed dead, as the ship caught fire. The ship has since been towed back to an Israeli sea port.\nThe Israeli military said that up to 100 elite had assisted Hezbollah in providing and helping firing C-802 missiles. This was denied by Iran and Hezbollah. Iran called it an attempt \"to escape reality with the aim of covering up (Israel's) inability to confront the Lebanese nation and resistance\".\nAn Israeli missile incinerated the people inside a van near the southern port of Tyre, killing eight children and nine adults and also wounding six others. Police said the vehicle the Israelis destroyed was carrying refugees fleeing the village of Marwaheen after Israel told them to flee via a loudspeaker announcement. Some Lebanese civilians sought shelter at a Ghanaian UN position, but were turned away and went back to the village; they were attacked as they fled for the second time.\nEarly on Saturday, more C-802 missiles were fired toward Israeli warships. According to the Israeli military, the missiles missed their intended target but hit and sank an Egyptian merchant ship.\nIsrael has given Syria a 72 hour ultimatum to stop Hezbollah's activity, according to London-based Arabic language newspaper Al-Hayat and a senior source in the United States Pentagon or else Israel \"would launch an offensive with disastrous consequences.\". The ultimatum also included the release of kidnapped IDF troops. Israel stated that if such a situation did not come about, they may attack targets within Syria.\nLebanese PM Fouad Siniora declared Lebanon a \"disaster zone\" Saturday and called upon the international community for a cease-fire and help to stop the Israeli \"war machine\". He added; \"These are hours for unity, not for division\".\nRussian PM Vladimir Putin commented early Saturday that he suspected Israel had more on its agenda than rescuing kidnapped soldiers. Putin said at a G-8 press conference in St Petersburg that \"it is our impression that aside from seeking to return the abducted soldiers, Israel is pursuing wider goals\", without elaborating his statement.\nLebanon.\nAt least 35 Lebanese were killed in Israeli air strikes, including civilians. According to witnesses, Israeli planes fired four rockets at the Masnaa crossing point, on the Beirut-Damascus road near the Lebanon-Syria border.\nA building in Beirut where Hezbollah has its main office was hit again Saturday by Israeli warplanes. The Palestinian Hamas organization headquarters in Beirut was also targeted. No casualties were reported.\nIsrael's campaign against Hezbollah in Lebanon has so far resulted in the deaths of 96 people, most civilians, and at least 229 have been wounded.\nThe ports in Beirut and Tripoli were hit by Israeli warplanes on Saturday. Radar installations, a lighthouse and grain silos were hit in the raid on Beirut. The coastal cities of Batroun and Juineh were also hit. Two Lebanese soldiers were killed and three wounded in the attacks.\nIsraeli actions such as blockading Lebanese ports and targeting Beirut's Rafiq Hariri International Airport have also resulted in losses for the latter country's economy. The Israeli army said that it had struck about 150 targets so far, less than 12 of which (according to ) were directly connected with Hezbollah.\nIsrael.\nAreas in northern Israel have been under heavy shelling the entire night. Hezbollah fired 12 new rockets, which hit the towns of and . Twelve people were wounded in Tiberias and over 60 in northern Israel, with heavy damage to property and houses.\nThe list of civilian locations that have been hit by Hezbollah so far include the city of , , Tiberias, Karmiel, , , , and smaller towns including Ma'alot, Meron, Kabri, Shavi Zion, Horfish, Elkosh, Zuriel, Oshrot, and others. So far, a dozen Israeli soldiers and four civilians were killed, and many dozens wounded.\nIsrael says it has deployed missile batteries, (which are meant to counter ballistic and cruise missle attacks, rather than small rockets fired by the Hezbollah) but did not state a reason.\nGaza.\nIsrael is continuing its offensive in the Gaza strip against Hamas after a soldier named was kidnapped in a raid, June 2006.\nDespite the Israeli offensive, Palestinians fired more rockets from the Gaza Strip into Israel, landing mainly in the town Shderot.\nBackground.\nThis is the fourth day of violence after July 11 when Hezbollah attacked Israeli army patrols and captured two Israeli soldiers in a mission Hezbollah called \"Truthful Promise\". Israel later confirmed the soldiers were kidnapped and then began a mission it called \"Operation Just Reward\". On July 12 Israel set up a blockade of Lebanon and attacked the landing strips at Beirut International Airport as well as a fuel tank and other areas in Lebanon, while Hezbollah fired rockets into northern Israel. The scenes repeated themselves the coming days.\nOn July 15 Israel commenced air strikes on targets in central Beirut, the Lebanese capital, in an attempt to damage the infrastructure used by Hezbollah."}

Allama Turabi had narrowly escaped an attempt on his life in April 2006 when a bomb was exploded just after his car crossed the area. He was the leader of a Shia party, Islami Tehreek Pakistan, and a vice provincial chief for Mutahida Majlis-e-Amal Sindh (MMA), an opposition religious coalition. \nManzoor Mughal, a police investigator, said a lone attacker on foot had detonated the bomb at the gate of Allama Turabi's house as he was getting into a car.

Mr Mughal said police had collected body parts, including the head of the attacker. \nAbout 300 youths gathered near Allama Turabi's house after the blast, weeping and chanting slogans against the US and Israel. Reports said that public buses were damaged and set alight in disturbances following the killing, and one person was reported killed.

It was the first time a team had been held scoreless in the Tri Nations since South Africa's 28-0 loss to the All Blacks in Dunedin in 1999, and the margin was one point shy of the Springboks' worst defeat in their history, a 53-3 rout by England at Twickenham in 2002.\nThe Wallabies made four changes to their starting lineup that lost to the All Blacks the week before. Hooker Jeremy Paul, No. 8 Scott Fava and inside center Giteau were all moved into the starting lineup, with Rocky Elsom moving to blindside flanker. Queensland prop Rodney Blake was expected to return for the Wallabies, but failed to recover from injury in time. The Springboks, playing their first Tri Nations match of the season, introduced two un-capped players; Bulls winger Akona Ndugane and No. 8 Pierre Spies.\nThe first points of the match were scored by Stephen Larkham, who landed an early drop goal for Australia. Greg Holmes, Paul and Giteau all scored tries in the first half. Giteau grabbed a double, scoring his second try in the second half, along with fullback Chris Latham, and replacement lock Mark Chisholm. In total, Stirling Mortlock racked up 18 points through conversions of tries and penalty goals. The match was played at Brisbane's Suncorp Stadium, in mostly fine conditions, though the second half was covered in light rain. Next week South Africa will meet the All Blacks."}

The cause of the fire is not yet known.\nUPDATE: \nThe flames continue to rage in Northern Minnesota as the fire expands by the hour, now engulfing more than 6,000 acres of the Boundary Waters Canoe Area, as reported by the Minneapolis Star Tribune today. \nThe purported cause of the fire is a lightning strike.\nThere are now over 60 firefighters stationed on the ground near the fire, though it is still considered too dangerous to combat the blaze directly.\nThis is the largest fire to take place in Minnesota in years, and has now spread to within 3 miles of the Gunflint Trail, though the trail may be protected by controlled burn zones put in place in recent years by the US Forest Service. \nGovenor Tim Pawlenty plans a fly-over of the afflicted area."}

Many Lebanese citizens have emigrated to Canada and often return to spend their summers in the south of Lebanon. \nSixteen thousand Canadians have registered with the embassy in Beirut, but MacKay said the number of those present could be as high as 40,000. \"We're calling for restraint in all sectors right now and hope to be able to have those ships in place and citizens moving out of Lebanon as quickly as possible.\" MacKay said. \nParliament Hill demonstrators in Ottawa on Sunday protested the Harper government's position regarding the ongoing strikes.

Scenarios which were unfolding were discussed. \nThe \"Toronto Star\" reported a conversation between Byers and an IDF colonel / lawyer during a luncheon. According to Byers, the colonel felt that attacks on southern Lebanon and civilian targets as well as Lebanese infrastructure would be justified under specific interpretations and in certain circumstances. She asked Byers for his opinion on these matters.\nThe lawyer Byers met with is a colonel with a Harvard doctorate. He met with her by an invitation that came while he was a visiting professor at the University of Tel Aviv. After just a few minutes, the Harvard graduated colonel got to the point of their meeting: \n\"There have been a number of missile attacks along our northern border,\" she said. \"We're going to respond with air strikes against some Hezbollah installations in southern Lebanon next week. What do you think?\" \nByers said he was taken aback as governments rarely consult foreign academics about their military plans. Though it was not clear whether the colonel was engaged in private conversation or asking for the professor's services on behalf of the military.\nByers responded; \"Well, for starters, any act of self-defence has to be necessary and proportionate.\"\nByers advised the colonel, \"Also, you must never target civilians or facilities such as water-filtration or electrical plants relied upon by civilians.\" \n\"Ah, here we disagree!\" the colonel exclaimed. \"Collateral damage is allowed in situations of military necessity. And dual-use facilities are legitimate targets.\"\n\"What constitutes military necessity depends on the relative capabilities of the opposing forces,\" Byers responded, \"And the dual-use argument is a slippery slope.\"\n\"Perhaps.\" the Israeli colonel said. \n\"There's a second reason you should do everything possible to protect civilians,\" Byers advised. \"Israel has to work particularly hard to maintain the moral high ground. Your reputation has suffered because of your treatment of the Palestinians.\"\n\"We're completely justified in our treatment of the Palestinians,\" the colonel said.\n\"We can disagree on that,\" Byers said, \"but do me a favour, as someone who wants to sympathize with Israel. If you do launch air strikes, please limit yourself to Hezbollah facilities. Leave civilians \u2014 and the Lebanese government \u2014 alone.\"\nTwo years ago, Byers' IDF advisor suggested considering southern Lebanon a failed state was justification for incursions and air strikes. In contrast, speaking about the current crisis, Israel's Prime Minister Ehud Olmert said the recent cross-border attack by Hezbollah was an \"act of war\" committed by the government of Lebanon and that, \"The events this morning are not terror attacks but actions of a sovereign state that attacked Israel for no reason. The Lebanese government, of which Hezbollah is a member, is trying to destabilize regional stability. Lebanon is responsible and it will bear responsibility.\"\nIsrael's defense ministry confirmed it held Lebanon \"directly responsible\" for their fate and safe return of the two soldiers captured by Hezbollah. The Israeli Defense Ministry issued a statement which said; \"The Lebanese government is responsible for the fate of the Israeli soldiers, and must take immediate action to locate them without harming them and return them to Israel.\""}

Mr Yudhoyono toured the small town of Pangandaran meeting people who were staying in a temporary camp. Many of them are too scared to return home after the huge wave killed nearly 550 people. The tsunami was produced by an underwater earthquake with a magnitude of 7.7 on the Richter scale.\nAt the camp, Mr Yudhoyono told one woman to \"be strong\". According to a relief worker, about 3,000 people have taken refuge at the site, but only about 500 of them have lost their homes. She said people are too scared to go home because they live on the coast, a sentiment shared by one woman who told AFP: \"I did not lose my home, and my husband and child are safe, but we are still traumatised by the tsunami and are too afraid to return home in case another one comes.\"\nWest Java Governor Danny Setiawan told journalists that officials are persuading people to return home, and he said a return to normality \"could take five to six years\".\nAid workers are working to provide relief to the 15,500 people who have been left homeless as a result of the two-meter high wave. Yesterday, 15 tonnes of rice and 1,600 boxes of instant noodles were dropped, but some residents have said government assistance is necessary for them to regain their livelihoods. One woman told Reuters, \"I don\u2019t have anything, only 5,000 rupiah (\u00a30.30, $0.55) in my wallet.

Lieutenant Colonel Tri Yuniarta has told his 350-strong rescue team in Pangandaran to finish collecting bodies trapped under debris by next Monday. \nThe Indonesian government has been criticised for failing to inform residents that a tsunami was looming. After the underwater earthquake was detected, US and Japanese agencies issued warning notices, but the government has admitted it was unable to transmit the bulletins to coastal areas. Speaking yesterday, Mr Yudhoyono vowed to hasten efforts to build an early warning system planned after the 2004 Asian tsunami. \"We want to expedite efforts to get infrastructure for the tsunami warning system in place,\" AP quoted him as saying. \"I will work with parliament to get the budget\".\nSurvivors have described the tsunami, which struck a 200km stretch of Java's southern coast.

The statement said that Israel \"needs to refrain from unilateral acts that could prejudice a final settlement and agree to negotiate in good faith,\" .\nSummit leaders express differing opinions.\nSpeaking to reporters, the assembled leaders did demonstrate some differences in their views on the conflict. \nUnited States President George W. Bush said on Sunday that Hezbollah and its links with Iran and Syria is a root cause of instability in the Middle East. United Kingdom Prime Minister Tony Blair said that extremists backed by Syria and Iran wanted to interrupt the [peace] process. Tony Blair suggested that he was keen to travel to the Middle-East personally in discussions with George W. Bush, but George Bush suggested that Condoleezza Rice should travel there instead.\nRussian President Vladimir Putin had earlier termed Israel's actions as excessive and on Saturday said that Israel was pursuing \"other, wider goals\". He also told reporters that Russia has specifically insisted on dropping any reference to Syria and Iran as Hezbollah supporters in the summit declaration.\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel told reporters, \"We demand first that the Israeli soldiers be returned to Israel healthy, that the attacks on Israel cease, and then naturally for Israel to halt military action.\"\nWhile French President Jacques Chirac said on Sunday that the G8 is calling for a ceasefire, the US Undersecretary of State for political affairs Nicholas Burns disagreed and said that there was no push for one. Chirac had also expressed \"extreme reservations about the disproportionate character of the Israeli reactions,\" but no such language was incorporated into the G8 statement.\nCall for UN action.\nThe summit declaration called on the UN Security Council to draw up plans for implementing its resolutions UNSCR 1559 and 1680, which call for extending the Lebanese government's authority over all of Lebanon and the disarming of militias such as Hezbollah. It also suggested that the Council should look at setting up a monitoring force in Lebanon.\nThe United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan said that Security Council members would follow up on the declaration and that starting Monday, work out a detailed plan for deploying a multilateral security force in Lebanon.\nReactions from the Middle-east.\nIsrael later welcomed the Summit statement, supporting its call for Hezbollah to free the Israeli soldiers and halt rocket fire into Israel. Israel's Foreign Minister, Tzipi Livni said that the international community has \"placed the responsibility for the conflict on extremist elements,\" and that Israel \"sees the path to a solution through the release of the abducted soldiers, a cessation of rocket fire on Israel, and full implementation of (U.N.) resolution 1559,\". \nIn initial reaction to the proposed deployment, Israeli government spokeswoman Miri Eisin said, \"I don't think we're at that stage yet. We're at the stage where we want to be sure that Hezbollah is not deployed at our northern border,\".\nIn an address to the nation, Lebanese Prime Minister Fouad Siniora urged an immediate cease-fire and establishment of the government's sovereignty in all Lebanese territory with help from the UN. It requested humanitarian aid and called for international pressure on Israel to stop its attacks. Disclaiming prior knowledge or responsibility for Hezbollah's capture of Israeli soldiers, the Prime Minister termed Israel's actions as \"collective punishment\".\nIranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei said yesterday that Hezbollah would not disarm, despite calls from the US and \"Zionists\" (Israel). Iran says it offers moral but not military support to the Hezbollah and has denied Israeli accusations that Iranian arms have been used in the latest conflict.\nSyria spoke of a \"harsh and direct\" response to any attack by Israel. Syrian President Bashar al-Assad said on Saturday that Syria will put its resources at the disposal of Lebanon to help cope with Israeli attacks devastating the country.\nWTO Trade talks.\nThe leaders of Brazil, China, India, Mexico and South Africa and the World Trade Organisation chief Pascal Lamy were also present at the final session of their three-day summit. \nThey joined the G8 leaders in addressing the stalled negotiations in the Doha round of the WTO trade negotiations. The talks were deadlocked over US cuts on farm subsidies, the EU cuts on tariffs on farm goods and developing countries opening their markets for industrial goods and services.\nTimely progress in the talks is crucial as the US president's special authority to negotiate trade deals will expire in a year. \nG8 powers have asked their trade negotiators and Pascal Lamy to broker a breakthrough on the stalled talks, giving WTO members one month to revive the Doha round.\nA statement released said that the G8 was \"fully committed to the development dimension of ongoing WTO talks.\" and that \"The Doha Round should deliver real cuts in tariffs, effective cuts in subsidies and real new trade flows,\". \n\"In agriculture we are committed to substantially reducing trade-distorting domestic support and to the parallel elimination by the end of 2013 of all forms of export subsidies a well as establishment of effective disciplines on all export measures with equivalent effect as agreed in Hong Kong, the statement said.\nThe G8 also expressed support for Russia's entry into WTO in accordance with the rules that apply to all its members.\nAssistance to Africa and other issues.\nWhile assistance to Africa was top of the agenda at last year's summit, this year it figured in the final session attended by Kofi Annan and the African Union delegation. Mr. Annan cited progress in implementing last years plans, but said much more needs to be done. \n\"Fourteen African countries have been given complete debt relief, eight more have had substantial debt relief. We've seen some progress in development assistance. For the first time in many years we have gone over 100 billion dollars,\" he said.\nThe formal agenda of the meeting included securing energy supplies, boosting world trade talks and addressing a standoff over Iran's nuclear ambitions.

He reiterated the Lebanese government position, urging Hezbollah to release Israeli soldiers, and calling on Israel to cease its attacks, terming them \"disproportionate\". However, an Israeli general said that the offensive could go on for weeks to come. \nIsraeli PM Ehud Olmert claimed that last week's kidnappings were a timed attempt to divert attention from Iran's nuclear programme. The Rapporteur of Iran's Majlis' National Security and Foreign Policy Commission Kazem Jalali dismissed the allegation, denying any such role. \nThe civilian population in Lebanon has taken the largest toll in the conflict; 200 Lebanese civilians have been reported to be killed in the past seven days, 30 of them today. As a result of Hezbollah fire, at least 24 Israelis have been reported killed, including 9 civilians at the Haifa train station. In addition, 30 Lebanese soldiers have died without engaging Israeli units. Eleven of them were killed today in an Israeli air strike on a Lebanese army base east of Beirut. A Lebanese barracks was also hit yesterday, killing several soldiers.\nThe United Nations want an international peace contingent to be stationed in southern Lebanon to stop Hezbollah from firing missiles into Israel. The force would act as a stabilisation force against attacks from both sides in the conflict. \n500,000 people have been displaced in Lebanon by the violence which could end in a humanitarian disaster, UN said.\nA UN team was in Israel today, holding talks with the Israeli FM about a possible ceasefire agreement. However, the minister reiterated Israel's ultimatum that its two soldiers should be released and the Lebanese government posts troops in southern Lebanon before agreeing on a ceasefire. Lebanon say they fear posting soldiers in it's southern region could spark a civil war in the country.\nHezbollah militants have also today fired rockets on towns in northern Israel. Haifa, Acre, Kiryat Shemona and the region of Gush Halav have been hit. One Israeli was killed. Hezbollah have made comparisons between the Israeli \"enemy combatants\" they are holding without trial, and the inmates of Guantanamo Bay who they say have a similar status.\nToday, transport trucks were again targeted by warplanes. Israel says it believed that the trucks were transporting missiles for Hezbollah. The Israeli military say 750 Hezbollah rockets, missiles and mortars have so far been fired since the start of the crisis.\nHundreds of foreigners have been evacuated from Lebanon by any available transportation. Ships, helicopters and buses have been used by several European countries and the United States to ferry their citizens out of the country."}

Bush that banned funding by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) for embryonic stem cell research of stem cell lines created after the executive order was issued. The new bill does not include a provision against privately funded research, which is legal under the law, only research funded by NIH. \nThe bill includes three ethical requirements for funded research. First, the stem cells were derived from human embryos that have been donated from in-vitro fertilization clinics, were created for the purposes of fertility treatment, and were in excess of the clinical need of the individuals seeking such treatment. Second, prior to the consideration of embryo donation and through consultation with the individuals seeking fertility treatment, it was determined that the embryos would never be implanted in a woman and would otherwise be discarded. And lastly, the individuals seeking fertility treatment donated the embryos with written informed consent and without receiving any financial or other inducements to make the donation.\nPresident Bush is expected to veto the bill as early as today, White House Press Secretary Tony Snow said the veto would be \"pretty swift\". This would be President Bush's first veto of his two terms in office. \nAs with any vetoed bill, a two-thirds majority of the House and Senate can override said veto, but the original vote (63-37) show that the Senate is more than likely to not get the override votes it would need. Even without the two-thirds original vote, Senator Carl Levin of Michigan has voiced support for a veto override.\nTwo other bills, S2754 and S3504, the Alternative Pluripotent Stem Cell Therapies Enhancement Act and the Fetus Farming Prohibition Act of 2006, respectively, were failed and passed in that order by the House of Representatives.

According to Supe, DNA of complainant \"Nicole\" was found in samples of \"biological fluid\" found on the panties she was wearing on the night of Nov. 1, 2005 and in the condom purportedly used by accused Lance Corporal Daniel Smith in committing the alleged rape.\nThe used condom was retrieved at Subic's Alava Pier where a distraught Nicole was found after the alleged rape. \n\"The condom and the underwear had female DNA, and they matched. They are the same DNA profiles ... which means they most likely belong to the same person,\" the expert witness said during direct examination by State Prosecutor Hazel Valdez.\nOnly Nicole's underwear tested positive for male DNA---a result that Supe attributed to the possible \"degradation\" of bodily fluids on the condom to \"environmental insults, particularly the humid condition, bacterial factors that may have contaminated it ... and the enzyme inside DNA which destroys it when functioning outside a living system.\"\nIn reply to Valdez\u2019s question, Supe said that while it was possible that the evidence had not been handled properly before the turnover, he said the condom and the panties were not contaminated as they still yielded DNA samples.\nUpon Valdez's questioning, Supe related how analysts came to match the female DNA found in both specimens with that of the complainant.\nHe said Nicole's DNA, extracted from a blood sample that she had voluntarily provided, was the same as that found in the panties and the condom.\n\"I am comparing now, and it appears that they match exactly -- the DNA profiles generated from the blood sample and the samples generated from the condom and the underwear,\" said Supe, referring to two DNA test results he was holding.\nValdez then sought Supe's expertise on the possible indications of the presence of male DNA in a woman\u2019s underwear, and asked him its possible source.\nSupe replied: \"We're dealing here with a [pair of panties] and you would think of areas that come in contact with a panty... The most probable source is either saliva or seminal stains. But if you go by logic, I don't see any reason why anybody would lick a panty.\" While the test may lead experts to areas where DNA can be extracted, it cannot specify which part of the body the spots came from, Supe had explained.\nSupe said the owner of the male DNA could not be identified as yet, as the crime laboratory lacked a sample with which to compare the results. None of the accused----Smith, Lance Corporals Keith Silkwood and Dominic Duplantis, and Staff Sgt. Chad Carpentier---had submitted his specimen for DNA testing. The prosecution panel had filed a motion on July 17, asking the court to compel the accused to submit blood samples for comparison with the male DNA found in Nicole's panties. Defense lawyers told the court that they would file their reply on July 20.\nIn response to the question on how could a female's DNA be in a used condom, Supe replied: \"The most plausible is that the inside of the condom came in contact with [Nicole]... Maybe that part of the condom was rubbed with [Nicole],\" he said. \"Most likely it came in contact with the genital area, [but it] was turned inside out most likely, such that the [DNA] specimen was preserved.\"\nWhen asked to demonstrate how a condom could have been reversed, Supe had apparently anticipated the question and brought a condom. He then demonstrated how a condom could have been turned inside out in the act of removing it.\nDefense lawyer Jose Justiniano said Supe's testimony did not help prove rape. He said the presence of the male and female DNA in the specimen could at most prove that a man and a woman had sex, not whether or not there was \"a presence of force or intimidation,\"\nThis case has garnered nationwide attention in Philippines because it involves US military men stationed in Philippines. As required by the Visiting Forces Agreement, the case has to be resolved within one year. \nCross-examination of Supe is scheduled for Thursday, July 20."}

They later pulled their troops back, claiming they were collecting defected troops and not planning an attack. \nA convoy of around 2,000 soldiers were seen crossing the Ethiopian frontier overnight, joining another 2,000 troops already based in the border town of Luk.

However a direct conflict seems more and more likely, as Mr. Simon confirmed that \"Ethiopia is in a position to defend itself to ensure the stability of the Horn of Africa\". \nThe Ethiopian government has openly backed the provisional government which has held a weak power over the country since 1991.

Liver failure has been reported in fourteen adult patients, four of whom died; another twenty-three sustained \"serious liver injury.\" \nIn January 2006, after cases of serious liver toxicity were reported in the \"Annals of Internal Medicine\" (a professional journal published by the ), the FDA issued a public advisory to that effect and, in June, 2006 announced that it had completed its safety assessment and required the manufacturer to add additional warnings about the risks of liver toxicity and for patients with myasthenia gravis to the product labeling.\nAn F.D.A. spokeswoman, Susan Bro, said, \u201cEvery issue or question raised during the Ketek review process and subsequently since approval has been rigorously reviewed by the nation\u2019s best physicians, statisticians and epidemiologists both internal and external to the F.D.A.\u201d\nA spokeswoman for drugmaker Sanofi-Aventis announced the drug's safety label has already been modified. \"We continue to believe that the benefits of Ketek outweigh the risks when the drug is used as directed for its approved indications,\" said Dr. Sol Rajfer, president of science and medical affairs of Sanofi-Aventis' U.S. division.\nExcerpts of Dr. Graham's internal June 16 memorandum published by the \"Times\" reveal strong criticism of the drug's approval. \u201cIt\u2019s as if every principle governing the review and approval of new drugs was abandoned or suspended where Telithromycin is concerned,\u201d Dr. Graham wrote. In the document, Graham subsequently advised Telithromycin's \"immediate withdrawal\" from the U.S. prescription drug market. The \"Times\" characterized the internal FDA climate as a \"fierce battle,\" which is most likely fueled by the increased press attention in recent months. \nApart from Dr. Graham, who also voiced safety concerns during the Vioxx scandal, three other F.D.A. officials have been identified as critics of Telithromycin's approval: Dr. Charles Cooper, Dr. David Ross and Dr. Rosemary Johann-Liang. Bipartisan congressional interest has also been triggered. Senator Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa, chairman, Senate Finance Committee) is \"investigating\" the issue with Representatives (D-Mass) and (D-Calif). \nAlthough The \"Times\" claimed to receive more than \"dozens\" of messages (presumably e-mails), the paper did not disclose the source."}

Nasrallah stated that Israeli reports of having destroyed half of Hezbollah's missile stores were erroneous and that, \"the leadership of Hezbollah has not been touched.\" He promised \"more surprises\".\nWhile Nasrallah asks for an exchange of Israeli-held prisoners for two IDF soldiers captured by a Hezbollah incursion into Israel following the G8 summit, the UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan called for an immediate cease-fire between the two bordering nations on Thursday. But the UN holds little sway in Lebanon.\nThe Lebanese government is the first elected by a popular vote following last year's resignation of the Syrian backed government of Omar Karami in February. Demonstrations and pressure from the international community led to a complete withdrawal by Syria and free and democratic elections in June. The current Israel-Lebanon crisis is the most serious challenge faced by the relatively inexperienced government."}

The match was sealed with another penalty kick by Carter, and a late try from All Black captain Richie McCaw."}

In a press statement this morning, the UIC leader Sheikh Sharif Ahmed said \"We do not negotiate with a government which is being helped by the enemy of Somalia.\"\nThe two sides were due to continue what have become increasingly hostile talks this weekend in the Sudanese capital, Khartoum. The weakened interim government led by President Abdullahi Yusuf is currently based in the town of Baidoa, north of the capital Mogadishu, which the Islamic militias captured earlier in July; the UIC now control most of southern Somalia.\nThe breakdown of talks comes as eyewitnesses report seeing more Ethiopian troops crossing the border. It's believed around 5,000 are now stationed in the country, attempting to protect President Yusuf's fragile government. The BBC is reporting 200 Ethiopian troops have captured an airfield outside Waajid early this morning, but the Ethiopian government has yet to confirm this \u2014 so far they have denied all military intervention and it is not clear if there was any fighting in the town. \nEthiopia's involvement has angered the Islamist militia who vowed a \"holy war\" against the mainly Christian state if soldiers were sent in.

An op-ed piece in the Sydney Morning Herald concludes that the sale of more American arms to the Israeli arm will cause anger and might be used to justify Iran supplying missiles to Hezbollah. According to Arab political analysts the decision to rush more bombs to Israel will increase existing anti-American feelings in the Middle East and will help radicals.\nThe rushing of more bombs to Israel is consistent with US policy, according to a report issued three days ago by the World Policy Institute which indicates that Israel has always been the largest recipient of military aid from the United States. According to Frida Berrigan, co-author of the review entitled \"U.S. Military Assistance and Arms Transfers to Israel: U.S. Aid, Companies Fuel Israeli Military\", U.S. military aid to Israel is about $3 billion a year. This equates to about 20% of the Israeli military budget annually. According to Berrigan, in an interview given to Democracy Now on Friday, just on the 14th of July while calling for restraint the U.S. also sold $120 million worth of jet fuel to the Israeli military assisting their bombing campaign of Lebanon. In fact, Berrigan said, since the Bush administration came into power, about a total of $6.3 billion worth of weapons sold to Israel. Berrigan also added that if in fact the United States wanted to cut military aid at this time they have precedent to do so, citing as an example the Reagan administration's cut of military aid and freezing of weapons sales to Israel during its last invasion of Lebanon in 1981, during the then conflict's first 10 weeks. \nIsrael claims they have been using precision-guided munitions in order to neutralize Hezbollah and to minimize harm to civilians. However, U.N. and Lebanese officials estimate at least 360 Lebanese civilians have been killed and more than 1,000 wounded, with about 700,000 people already displaced since Israel's bombings began. According to the United Nation's emergency relief co-coordinator, Jan Egeland, nearly one third of casualties resulting from the Israeli offensive in Lebanon have been children. Egeland, who visited Lebanon today denounced the Israeli strikes and appealed for safe passage for aid, saying civilians were paying a \"disproportionate price\" in the attacks targeting Hezbollah strongholds. He said civilians are paying a disproportionate price in Lebanon and northern Israel and stated that \"A disproportionate response by Israel is a violation of international humanitarian law.\"\nIn many capital cities around the world including the Middle East, as well as Europe, Canada, Latin America and the United States thousands of people took part in demonstrations against the Israeli strikes. In London people marched to the US embassy and shouted slogans such as \"George Bush, terrorist\" and \"Down, down, USA.\" In Tel Aviv 1,000 Israeli Jews and Arabs also turned out to denounce their country's actions, gathering in Rabin Square and brandishing placards reading \"war is disaster\" and \"Jews and Arabs refuse to be enemies.\" "}

The UN relief coordinator Jan Egeland, who visited Beirut said that a humanitarian crisis was unfolding in the country and outlined planned relief efforts. Efforts are underway to open a safe corridor to allow aid shipments to be sent to Lebanon. The evacuation of foreign nationals from Lebanon continues. Israel launched more air strikes and also a ground incursion into Lebanon, and Hezbollah launched rocket attacks on northern Israel.\nUN relief coordinator visits Beirut.\nUN relief coordinator Jan Egeland flew to Beirut for a 48 hour visit to Lebanon focused on assistance required by people displaced or trapped by the conflict.\nHe visited Haret Hreik, a crowded Beirut neighborhood where Hezbollah had its headquarters, hours after it was bombed by Israel. Calling the destruction there \"horrific\", he said, \"I did not know it was block after block of houses... It makes it a violation of humanitarian law\". Mr. Egeland appealed for both sides to put a halt to attacks.\nThe Israeli government said the military was trying to be as precise as possible in its operations in Lebanon. \"The Lebanese people are not our enemy. We cannot sit idly by while Hezbollah terrorists launch rockets at our towns and cities,\" Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman Mark Regev said.\nMr. Egeland said there was a humanitarian crisis unfolding in Lebanon, and more than half a million people were directly affected. He said that wounded people were unable to get treatment, no safe drinking water was available and that tens of thousands of civilians were caught in the crossfire between the Israeli Defense Forces and Hezbollah militants, particularly in south Lebanon. He expected the number of displaced to increase \"dramatically\" as Israel has warned the population of south Lebanon to leave the area ahead of possible new military action there.\nOutlining plans for a \"major\" relief operation, he called for an end to violence to facilitate the aid effort, saying, \"We can't get relief into the country in any quantity or distribute it beyond a few points\".\nSituation in Lebanon.\nThe Lebanese newspaper \"Daily Star\" reports that the number of displaced people in Lebanon passed 900,000 on Friday, with close to 40,000 refugees in Beirut itself. Other estimates place the number of refugees between half a million and a million. \nIsrael has urged the remaining people living in south Lebanon to leave, and streams of people, some carrying white flags, are making their way from the south. \nAbout 42,000 refugees had flooded into the city of Sidon from the surrounding countryside - believing it to be safe from attacks - when it was hit by Israeli strikes today.\nIn several towns and cities, food, medical supplies and fuel stocks are running low, and municipal authorities have expressed their inability to assist people. They have called for urgent shipments of food products such as milk, rice, sugar and canned meat; diapers and kitchen tools; medicine such as insulin, painkillers, antibiotics and chlorine to clean water; sterilized gloves; refrigerators to store medicine; tents; electrical generators of 5, 10, 20 and 30 kVA; blankets and other necessities.\nIn the government hospital in the Al-Bass Palestinian refugee camp, the mass burial of 86 bodies was begun, after rising casualties overwhelmed the local morgue. \nInfrastructure hit.\nThe air strikes and bombardment of roads, bridges and trucks has made supplying aid to affected areas even more difficult. Lebanon's only international airport has been out of action since the first days of the conflict. Reports estimate that billions of dollars worth of infrastructure has been destroyed.\nUN plans relief operation.\nThe UN relief coordinator Jan Egeland spoke to reporters of the plans for getting aid to Lebanon. He said UN supplies of humanitarian aid would begin to arrive in the next few days. \"But we need safe access,\" he said. \"So far Israel is not giving us access.\" He estimated that US $100 million is urgently needed to help the half a million to one million people in Lebanon who were in need of international assistance. \nU.N. and other relief agencies have been asking for humanitarian aid corridors to be opened up. Israel said it opened a 50-mile-long and five-mile-wide (80-kilometre by eight-kilometre) safe passage to Beirut for ships and aircraft to allow aid into Lebanon.\nEgeland said the United Nations was planning to deliver aid by setting up humanitarian corridors in the next few days. Aid will be shipped by road and by sea from Cyprus to Beirut and the southern city of Tyre, and by air. \nThe evacuation of foreign nationals from Lebanon continues, with most being taken to the island of Cyprus, where temporary accommodation has to be found for the estimated 70,000 evacuees, in the middle of the holiday tourist season. \nThe United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) says that it plans to evacuate civilians from the Lebanese-Israeli border in the next few days, but \"the ability to move will depend on the situation on the ground\".\nSituation in Israel.\nMeanwhile, thousands of Israelis have been living in bomb shelters since the fighting in Lebanon started and between a third to a half of all residents in northern Israel have left the area to escape the bombardment, officials said.\n\"For a week people have been sitting in shelters and security rooms, so they prefer to leave,\" said Adi Eldar, mayor of Carmiel in a report on \"Haaretz\" newspaper's Web site.\nAttacks continue.\nOn Saturday, more television stations and mobile telephone masts in Lebanon were targeted in Israeli strikes, killing five people, including a television station employee.\nIsrael struck Beirut, Sidon, a port city in the south crammed with refugees, for the first time and factories, roads and bridges in air strikes in the eastern Baalbek region, killing one person.\nIn Haifa, two people were killed by rockets fired by Hezbollah forces, and fifteen people are reported injured.\nCasualty figures rise.\nCurrent estimates say that more than 350 Lebanese and at least 36 Israelis have been killed in the conflict.

I credit the exit exam for focusing both students and schools on meeting this challenge. We need to sustain this effort until the achievement gap is erased completely.\"\n\"Eighty-five percent of Hispanic students in the Class of 2006 have passed the test, with 19.7 percent passing during the junior year and nearly 11 percent passing in their senior year,\" according to a statement released by O'Connell. \"By comparison, 11.5 percent of white students passed as juniors and 4.1 percent of white students passed as seniors.

And now this.\" Witt said.\nIsraeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert has said that the killing of 8 Israeli soldiers and the abduction of another two soldiers by Hezbollah militants on July 12 was an act of war; \"The murderous attack this morning was not a terror attack but an act of war,\" Olmert said. Lebanon has Hezbollah members in its parliament and \"must bear full responsibility. Israel's response will be restrained but very, very, very painful.\" Olmert said on July 12, 2006.\nOlmert told Israeli legislators today that; \"We want a two-kilometer (1.2-mile) space from the border in which it will not be possible to fire rockets toward soldiers and civilians houses and in which there will not be contact with military border patrols.\"\nIsraeli soldiers previously patrolled a \"security zone\" during Israel's 18-year occupation of south Lebanon. Olmert said today; \"We do not have any intention of returning to the security zone but want to create an area where there will be no Hezbollah.\" and he repeated Israel's call for an international force (being referred to as \"muscular\" or \"robust\") to be put on the Israel-Lebanon border.\n\"We need international intervention forces that have military capabilities and ability to respond and enforce, and not forces similar to UNIFIL.\" he said, referring to U.N. peacekeepers. \"I don't know when there will be a cease-fire. This is difficult, but we will stand up to this. ... We want to end the violent operation as quickly as possible but we won't end it before we believe we can achieve results that justify the price we have paid.\"\nDr. Bishara lambasted every aspect of Israel's position in this current conflict; \"Any comparison between Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert's and Hezbollah chief Nasrallah's political rhetoric must conclude that the latter is the more rational. His speeches are more consistent with the facts and rely less than Olmert's on religious expressions and allusions...Israeli politicians have no cultural or moral edge over resistance leaders. The latter are far less attached to Iran than the former are to the US...The people who unleashed the brutal war against Lebanon are neither intelligent nor courageous. Quite the opposite; they are mediocrities, cowards and opportunists, but they happen to have military superiority. And they possess the keys to the machinery of a state, a real state, one that is secure in its identity, that has clear national security goals and channels of national mobilization, as opposed to a long deferred project for statehood and a states built on the fragmentation of national identity.\" \nRegarding the current conflict, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert told an Israeli parliament committee Wednesday that Israel would not reoccupy any part of southern Lebanon.\nHowever, speaking on Israeli army radio, Justice Minister Haim Ramon - a close confidant of Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert - said \"everyone understands that a victory for Hezbollah is a victory for world terror\". He said that in order to prevent casualties amongst Israeli soldiers battling Hezbollah militants in southern Lebanon, villages should be flattened by the Israeli air force before ground troops move in. \n\"All those now in south Lebanon are terrorists who are related in some way to Hezbollah,\" Mr Ramon said.\nMr Ramon's call for the use of greater firepower came as the Israeli cabinet was set to decide whether to broaden its military offensive.

The US wanted cuts in import tariffs for farm products, which were rejected by EU, Japan and India, who asked for cuts in agricultural subsidies. \nPeter Mandelson, the EU trade commissioner, told the \"Financial Times\": \"If the US continues to demand dollar-for-dollar compensation in market access [cutting tariffs] for reducing domestic support, no one in the developing world will ever buy that and the EU will not either.\" Brazil also identified the US stand on subsidies as the reason the talks failed. \nSusan Schwab, the US trade representative, said that the other countries sought exemptions from tariff cuts for a wide range of goods and that such exemptions would defeat the object of the talks - to expand trade. \"As we went through the layers of loopholes . . . we discovered that a couple of our trading partners were more interested in loopholes than market access,\" she said.\nThe Indian Commerce and Industries Minister, Kamal Nath said that developing countries could not allow their subsistence farmers to lose their livelihood and food security to provide market access to agricultural products from developed countries.\nMany reasons attributed.\nThe major agricultural exporters US, Australia and initially Brazil called for reductions in import tariffs on farm goods, saying that this will benefit the poor by reducing the price of food items and will expand markets for farmers everywhere. \nDeveloping countries such as India, Indonesia, and the Philippines, which have millions of poor farmers, countered that cheap imports would drive the vulnerable farmers out of their livelihood. Their call for more tariff protection was also supported by developed nations in the EU and Japan, who also sought cuts on agricultural subsidies paid by the US to its farmers, saying that such subsidies distort prices and undercut their domestic producers unfairly. \nOfficials involved in the negotiations told the \"Financial Times\" that there wasn't sufficient pressure by exporters either to overcome the protectionist lobby. The upcoming congressional elections in the US have been cited by some as one of the reasons the US is holding firm on not cutting subsidies further. The unpopularity of the talks in many developing nations has also been cited as a reason negotiators from such countries preferred the talks to fail. \nPeter Draper, a research fellow at the South African Institute of International Affairs told the South African \"Business day\", \"The question is whether it is brinkmanship underpinned by major powers' negotiating tactics that has led to the breakdown or genuine irreconcilable differences. If it is the former, then the question will be for how long the negotiations will be suspended.\"\nReactions.\nOxfam, the NGO working on aid and development, which had earlier supported the talks but later withdrew it after the subsidy-cuts it sought appeared to be unlikely, blamed the US and EU for not cutting subsidies while demanding developing countries to open their markets. Saying that any delay has \"enormous costs\", it called for the US and EU to make fundamental changes to their offers. \nThe Congress of South African Trade Unions said the suspension of talks was an opportunity for developing nations to negotiate a better deal, adding that no-deal was better than the deal on the table.\nThe Australian National Farmers Federation expressed disappointment, saying that the suspension has cost Australian farmers $1.5 billion in potential new markets. \nThe US Farm Bureau said that it was not prepared to give additional ground until Europe offers more concessions, and that farmers will now try to lock in subsidies. \nAmong U.S. business groups, John J. Castellani, president of the Business Roundtable, an association of the chief executives of 160 of the biggest U.S. companies, said American negotiators were prepared to open markets if others did the same, and that Europe and other countries \"surrendered to protectionist measures\".\nWhat \"is\" the Doha round?\nThe Doha \"development\" round of talks, named after Doha, the capital city of Qatar, where it was inaugurated in November 2001, focuses heavily on creating a fair system of trade for the benefit of developing countries, in particular for trade in agricultural products. \nSuccessive rounds of negotiations have failed to produce agreements on key issues such as cuts on subsidies and tariffs. In a ministerial meeting in Cancun in 2003, developing countries, forming about two-thirds of the WTO members let the meetings fail rather than agreeing to a compromise. In 2004, the US came up with an offer to cut subsidies along with a demand that others cut tariffs. The previous two summits, the Group of Eight nations, passed declarations expressing commitment to the talks and calling for a deal.\nThe congressional authority of the US President to negotiate an agreement on trade, the Trade Promotion Authority, expires by the middle of next year. The amount of work needed to complete an agreement before that meant that the end of this month was effectively a deadline for a framework agreement. \nParallels to the Uruguay round.\nThe previous Uruguay round of talks were also suspended in 1990 after disagreements. The director-general of the WTO's forerunner, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), Arthur Dunkel then worked with member nations to produce the Dunkel draft, which eventually lead to a final agreement in 1994.\nFuture of the Doha round.\nThe suspended talks can only be revived by a consensus among the WTO's 149 members. The EU trading commissioner Peter Mandelson said that there were little short or medium term prospects of the talks restarting. Mark Vaile, Australian deputy prime minister and trade minister, said he would not accept superficial or partial reforms in the Doha round. The Indian Commerce and Industry Minister Kamal Nath that there was little ground for convergence on the core issues in the Doha round as of now. \nThe US trade representative Susan Schwab said that she would push the Doha agenda in regional trade meetings and with individual countries. She also said that she did not expect to use the current TPA, which expires in mid-2007 to enact a Doha round agreement. The \"Financial Times\" reports that it is unlikely that the US Congress will renew the authority, again dimming prospects of a near-term agreement.\nRepercussions of the failure.\nThe WTO director-general, Pascal Lamy said the failure of the negotiations sent a \"strong negative signal for the future of the world economy amidst the danger of a resurgence of protectionism\".\nThe South African chief negotiator Xavier Carim called the failed talks a \"serious setback\" and pointed to the \"huge\" opportunity cost it implies, particularly for developing countries. A World Bank study in 2005 estimated that global free trade in agriculture would generate gains of US $287 billion, of which $86 billion will accrue to developing countries. \nPeter Mandelson, the EU trade commissioner said that formulating the EU trade policy going ahead will begin by the end of August. Australia and Japan have said that they will focus on bilateral and multilateral trade agreements. A Japanese foreign ministry official, speaking to the \"Mainichi Daily News\", and Hilton Zunckel, trade adviser to developing countries, speaking to \"Business Day\" said that many other WTO members would focus on bilateral and regional trade agreements."}

Kantarci from the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, published an article in the professional journal \"Neurology\" on the transmission of multiple sclerosis (MS). The result of their studies is that the disease is transmitted to children more often when the father is the one having the disease.\nIn their studies, 441 children were examined whose fathers or mothers had MS, 45 of which were ill themselves. While only in 27 out of 323 cases, mothers transmitted the disease to their children - which makes 8,36 percent of the cases -, children of fathers with MS inherited it in 18 out of 117 cases - i.e. in 15,38 percent of the cases.\nMS is an illness caused by the immune system destroying nerves between the brain and the spinal cord. Later disorders consist of paralysis, speech disorders, impaired visions and problems in motion. Researchers found that MS is not a classical hereditary disease, but is caused by a number of genetic and outer impacts. Also, it is likely that several genes (with complex interactions) have an influence on the development of the disease.\nThe actual reasons for people to suffer from MS are still unknown. But what is known is that it occurs approximately twice as much in women than in men. And this could be the reason for fathers transmitting the disease to their children more often than mothers. The group thinks that men who are actually ill are carrying more genetic material causing the illness than women with MS which leads to a higher probability for their children to also have MS. This is known as the \"Carter effect\" in medicine."}

The peacekeepers at the post said the area within a kilometer of the post was hit with precision munitions, including 17 bombs and 12 artillery shells, four of which directly hit the UN observation post. The fatal strike with a \"precision-guided weapon\" according to UN military personnel hit the post at about 7.20pm. The victims were Austrian, Canadian, Chinese and Finnish UN-observers.\nThe Irish foreign ministry said that Israel ignored repeated warnings from Lieutenant-Colonel John Molloy, a key UN liaising officer, that its bombs were falling close to United Nations observers in southern Lebanon. The warnings came allegedly before an Israeli bomb killed four of the U.N. observers. \"On six separate occasions he [Lieutenant-Colonel John Molloy] was in contact with the Israelis to warn them that their bombardment was endangering the lives of UN staff in South Lebanon\". \"He warned: 'You have to address this problem or lives may be lost',\" an Irish foreign affairs spokesman said. \nSuzanne Coogan, a spokeswoman for the Irish Defence Minister Willie O'Dea said Molloy \"warned the Israelis that they were shelling in very close proximity to the post, and his warnings were very specific, explicit, detailed and stark.\" She concluded, \"Obviously those warnings went unheeded.\"\nIrish Foreign Minister Dermot Ahern said \"Evidence that we have would suggest that this was either an incredible accident or else was in some way directly targeted\".\nIn 1996 over 100 civilians were killed by the Israeli bombing of a UN compound in Lebanon in an incident known as the Qana shelling.\nThe United Nations.\nSecretary-General, Kofi Annan, said \"I am shocked and deeply distressed by the apparently deliberate targeting by Israeli Defense Forces of a United Nations observer post in southern Lebanon that has killed two United Nations military observers, with two more feared dead.\" \nKofi Annan also said \"This coordinated artillery and aerial attack on a long established and clearly marked U.N. post at Khiyam occurred despite personal assurances given to me by Prime Minister Ehud Olmert that U.N. positions would be spared Israeli fire.\"\nAccording to an press release there were 14 prior incidents of firing close to this position by aerial bombs and artillery shells before the fatal hit occurred. Also, 9 UNIFIL bases were bombed earlier during this war but with no apparent casualties. It was also reported Hezbollah fired \"from the vicinity\" of United Nations positions in Alma ash Shab, Tibnin, Brashit, At Tiri.\nChina.\nForeign Ministry spokesman Liu Jianchao said \"China urges the sides concerned, especially Israel, to take tangible measures to ensure the security of UN peacekeepers\" .\nChinese Assistant Foreign Minister Zhai Jun told Israeli Ambassador Yehoyada Haim \"China strongly condemns the activity to raid the UN peacekeeping post and urges Israel to carry out a thorough investigation and apologize to China and the victim's families, and coordinate with China to deal with the aftermath\".\nThe Chinese victim, named Du Zhaoyu, was a Lieutenant Colonel of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. He has been in Lebanon as a UN observer since January.\nFinland.\nFinnish President Tarja Halonen wanted a full investigation of the attack and also said there was no justification for an attack on the U.N. post.\nFinnish Foreign Minister Erkki Tuomioja said \"It is not the first time that they (U.N. peace keepers) have been attacked, but it is the first time they have been killed.\" Mr Tuomioja continued \"These so called precision attacks seem to be hitting everyone except Hezbollah, there have been hundreds of civilians, international workers and others killed already and it does not seem that by these means a military solution could be achieved.\"\nThe Finnish victim was Lieutenant-Commander Jarno M\u00e4kinen from Kaarina. He was 29 years old and joined United Nations Truce Supervision Organisation (UNTSO) in November 2005. Before that training officer and unit commander in the Uusimaa Brigade.\nCanada.\nPrime Minister Stephen Harper says Israel's deadly attack on a UN observation post in Lebanon was a \"terrible tragedy\". He doubts that the bombing was deliberate. \"I certainly doubt that to be the case, given that the government of Israel has been co-operating with us in our evacuation efforts\" \"We want to find out why this United Nations post was attacked and also why it remained manned during what is now, more or less, a war during obvious danger to these individuals.\"\nMr Harper said he was waiting for a call from Olmert. \"I expect that he will be expressing his deep regret. But also I'll be asking for his full co-operation in getting to the bottom of this.\" He also said he would follow the results of the UN and Israeli investigation rather than launching his own.\nThe Canadian victim is Major Paeta Hess-von Kruedener, a member of the Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry. He had completed nine months of his one-year assignment with the UN in Lebanon.\nOn July 18, Major Paeta Hess-von Kruedener provided CTV.ca with an update of his mission via e-mail.\nHe said that there had been numerous occasions when his post had come under fire. \"What I can tell you is this: we have on a daily basis had numerous occasions where our position has come under direct or indirect fire from both artillery and aerial bombing,\" \n\"The closest artillery has landed within two meters of our position and the closest 1000 lb aerial bomb has landed 100 meters from our patrol base.\" Retired Canadian Major General Lewis Mackenzie was interviewed on CBC radio, and told of an e-mail letter from Kruedener. \"He was telling us that Hezbollah soldiers were all over his position and the IDF were targeting them. Since Hezbollah don't have representation in the UN, they use the UN as shields knowing that they can't be punished for it.\"\nAustria.\nA statement from Austria foreign ministry issued by foreign minister Ursula Plassnik said \"Such an attack on unarmed UN observers is entirely unacceptable and can in no way be justified\" Ursula Plassnik expressed Austria's indignation over the attack and demanded an immediate and thorough investigation into the incident."}

After beating up the two, one of the officers allegedly said that, \"I should tie you up with chains and fuck you until you are cured of your sickness\". The two teens were each fined 500 lei (approximately \u20ac140 or USD179) for \"disturbing the public peace\", the other alternative being a criminal record for the same offence.

One of the teens stated that:\nAdditionally, the police officers threatened the teens that they would beat them again, with \"no witnesses\", when they were off duty.\nHomosexuality, including public manifestations of it, was decriminalised in Romania in 2001, when Article 200 of the Penal Code was fully repealed. Since 2000, the country has an anti-discrimination law which explicitly prohibits discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. However, despite this, social attitudes remain conservative and discrimination remains widespread and rarely reported and investigated, with the 2006 Bucharest GayFest, held in early June, provoking a violent reaction from many passers-by, even if it took place successfully due to heavy police protection. Gay rights organisations have also complained that when the anti-discrimination law is applied, fines are too low (the average fine for an employer discriminating on the basis of sexual orientation is about 300 lei, or less than \u20ac100 or $128)."}

He emphasised that marriage is a relationship between a man and a woman designed for creating and bringing children up: \u201cIt is apparent that the majority of people, or at least of governments, not only in England but Europe-wide, regard marriage as an age-old institution, valued and valuable, respectable and respected, and as a means not only of encouraging monogamy but also the procreation of children and their development and nurture in a family unit in which both maternal and paternal influences are available in respect of their nurture and upbringing.\u201d \nThe judge also said same-sex laws in England are in no way inferior as they are recognised as civil partnerships which give gay and lesbian couples the same rights as married couples on many issues. However, the two women say civil partnerships are not good enough for gay couples.\nAfter the hearing, Ms Wilkinson said she and Ms Kitzinger were deeply disappointed by the judge\u2019s decision. She said they had been stripped of their marriage by a judge who believes the traditional notion of marriage as being between a man and a woman so they can create children. \u201cIt perpetuates discrimination and it sends out a message that lesbian and gay marriages are inferior,\u201d she commented. The couple are now seeking financial help so they can mount an appeal. \u201cThis judgement will not stand the test of time.

The delayed approval of this drug has been raised in the Senate confirmation hearings for President Bush's nominee for the head of the FDA, Dr. Andrew C. von Eschenbach.\nEmergency contraceptives, also known as \"morning-after pills\" are used to prevent an unintended pregnancy, after unprotected intercourse has occurred. They usually contain high doses of the same drugs that are used in regular contraceptive pills. \nWhile they are considered as contraceptives by the medical establishment and by law, and classified as such by the FDA, some abortion opponents object to ECs as they believe that they constitute abortion. Some groups object to emergency contraception believing that it encourages sexual exploitation of young girls and some religious conservatives object to it as they believe that it promotes promiscuous behavior. Proponents of its use contend that it is merely a form of contraception, and point out that other forms, such as condoms or birth-control pills are widely used and that its use serves an important purpose, in cases where other contraceptives have failed (eg. a condom is torn) or to prevent conception in a rape victim. Approval for OTC sale would make the drug more easily available, which is considered important as the drug must be taken within 72 hours of intercourse to be effective. \nThe FDA's approval process for the Plan B pills, which contain the drug Levonorgestrel and are manufactured by Duramed, a subsidiary of Barr Laboratories has been mired in controversy since at least 2000, when the American Medical Association announced support for OTC availability. Last year, the FDA rejected the manufacturer's request to approve the pill for OTC sale, citing concerns over \"potential behavioral implications for younger adolescents\". The decision was criticised by advocates of EC as being based on political considerations rather than scientific reasons. The Government Accountability Office, a congressional watchdog also faulted the decision process. The FDA has also revised the minimum age of customers from 16 to 17 to now, 18.\nCurrently, the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee is holding hearings on the confirmation of the FDA Commissioner nominee, Dr. von Eschenbach. Senators Patty Murray(D) and Hillary Clinton(D) have held up the approval pending progress on the pill's approval process. Plan B was endorsed by a F.D.A. committee three years ago but had been denied approval for OTC sale by higher officials in the FDA. During the nomination of the last FDA Commissioner, Dr. Lester M. Crawford, Senators raised the issue and went ahead with the nomination after getting assurances that the drug's approval would be given in a timely manner. The deadlines set then were not met.\nSenator Clinton was reported as saying: \"Like so much of this government in the past five and a half years, it has been turned into a political football, and you're on the field.

In the clip, Colbert says that \"any website that has a longer entry on truthiness than Lutheranism has got its priorities straight.\" His keynote continued by re-emphasising Wikimedia's mission, as stated by Wales in a \"Slashdot\" interview: \"Imagine a world in which every single person on the planet is given free access to the sum of all human knowledge. That's what we're doing\".\nWales stated that Wikipedia is \"not as good as Britannica \u2014 yet\". Additionally, he also stated that in the coming year, Wikipedia will be making \"a turn towards quality\". \"We have always had this goal, but we all know we're not there yet - in the coming years one of the themes is going to be a turn towards quality.\" said Wales.\nHe then introduced Brad Patrick, the general counsel and recently-appointed interim CEO of Wikimedia. Patrick said he found Wikimedia after reading Wales' list \"Ten Things That Will Be Free\" on Lawrence Lessig's blog. After discovering the Wikimedia Foundation, Patrick emailed Wales about meeting for lunch. He had lunch with Wales a few months later and was hired as general counsel shortly after.\nWales went on to describe Wikia, the company he co-founded with Angela Beesley. He announced that Wikia has received venture capital, allowing them to hire full-time engineers to work on the MediaWiki software. He emphasized that Wikia, has \"a total commitment to free knowledge and respect for communities.\"\nLater, Wales announced that the One Laptop Per Child project will be including Wikipedia as the first element in the content repository. He also announced that the board has approved Wikiversity as \"a center for the creation and use of free learning materials and activities\". Wikiversity will \"create and host a range of free-content multilingual learning materials for all age groups in all languages\". It will be launched soon with a three language, six month, beta trial period.\nWales described a project called Wikiwyg: a WYSIWYG editor for the wiki. Wikiwyg is an attempt to make the wiki easier to edit. \"An intelligence test by making it hard to edit, just does not work,\" noted Wales. While the release date is uncertain both Wikia and Socialtext are devoting full-time engineers to the project. \nWales emphasized the need to focus on quality. He also briefly discussed the commitment in the German Wikipedia to rolling out a stable version. He stated that if we do not have it rolled out by next year's keynote \"we are making a big mistake\".\nWales finished his keynote by giving an update on his \"Ten Things That Will Be Free\" and proposing \"that the foundation seek funding to hire community coordinator and recruiters for important languages where we currently do poorly\".\nOther notable speakers included Ward Cunningham, Lawrence Lessig, Eben Moglen and many members of the Wikimedia communities.\nThe day wrapped up with a poster reception and a party celebrating Wikia's 250,000 articles and Wikia's founders Angela Beesley and Jimmy Wales birthdays. \nArchived copies of many of the presentations are available on the Wikimania wiki."}

A test involves measuring the testosterone/epitestosterone (T/E) ratio. An average caucasian has a 1:1 ratio but it is tolerated up to 4:1 (ratio was 6:1 or even 10:1 in the past).

The vaccinated rodents showed less increase in body weight even though they ate as much as their non-vaccinated counterparts. If supported by further studies, vaccination could become a promising new tool in the battle against the obesity pandemic, although application in humans is probably not for the near future.\nThe research team led by Dr. Kim Janda of the Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla, California, vaccinated male rats using three different haptens (small molecules which can elicit an immune response when attached to a large carrier such as a protein). Vaccination teaches the immune system to recognise and destroy a target.\nIn this experiment, the target was ghrelin, a hormone produced by the stomach in both humans and rodents. Ghrelin stimulates appetite and promotes the build-up of fat tissue. It was also previously shown that mice with the ghrelin gene knocked out (makes the mice unable to produce ghrelin), expend more energy and break down their fat stores more easily. In this study, vaccinated rats retained the same appetite, but the other effects were altered resulting in a lesser weight gain. The fact that the appetite remained unchanged came as a surprise to the investigators, but the idea of being able to eat the same and put on less weight is intriguing.\nThe rats in this study were on a low-energy, low-fat diet quite unlike the typical diet of people with obesity, where energy-rich snacks predominate. It remains uncertain whether these findings could be extended to that setting. The group is already planning further studies to ascertain the therapeutic potential of the new vaccine. The question also remains whether it will prove effective in already obese subjects, and the group plans further investigations into this matter.\nVaccines are generally used to combat infectious diseases, but recently their field of application has been expanded to unconventional areas, drug addiction for example. One of the possible advantages of this approach to the field of obesity medicine, is that vaccination could promote long term effects. This could supersede the need for chronic intake of drugs sometimes associated with severe adverse effects (such as the banned Fen-phen)."}

So the... Center does not need authorization\".\nShe said that the group had applied for the permit but the Interior Ministry denied the request without any explanation. \nSaying that the \"move is not in Iran's national interest\", Ebadi said that the group will protest against the decision and explore legal options to \"obtain our rights\".\nThe group was started by six prominent lawyers and has campaigned on human and minority rights issues for the past four years. It has criticized Iran's judiciary for violations of human rights.\nAbdolfattah Soltani, a member of the group was sentenced last month to five years in jail on charges of disclosing confidential information and opposing the regime.

It features more than 1,800 shows put on by 17,000 performers in 260 venues. \nThe Fringe now dominates the group of annual arts festivals that draw 750,000 visitors to Edinburgh every year, last year 1.3 million tickets were sold for Fringe shows. Anyone can register, pay a fee, find a venue and put on a show at the Fringe, famous for its quirky choice of venues - this year, they include a double-decker bus, a swimming pool, tree and a toilet; and \"Hamlet\" is being performed in a bouncy castle.\nAn estimated 160,000 people watched the Fringe Festival Cavalcade, a jamboree of more than 3000 marchers, which marks the launch of the Fringe.\nFringe director Gudgin urged audiences to be selective, saying that it would take five years, 11 months and 16 days to see all the shows back-to-back. The Festival is scheduled to end in August 28. \nA recent Edinburgh City Council study concluded the Fringe brought more than \u00a375m to the local economy each year. The festival's job openings included rickshaw drivers, show announcers to shouts details of the impending show and tell the audience when it is time to take their seats, and collectors to pick up flyers that people throw away. \nGood opening.\nSeveral shows sold out in a strong opening weekend, including those by comedians Russell Brand, the \"people's poet\" Pam Ayres in his maiden Fringe venture and \"One Man Star Wars\" at the Underbelly. Comedians Jason Byrne, Simon Amstell and Danny Bhoy along with shows such as \"Best of the Fest\" and \"Ella Meets Marilyn\" starring Sally Lindsay and Rain Pryor are expected to join the list.\nThe Assembly venue, with theatres on George Street and the 800 Assembly Hall on the Royal Mile, said it had sold 97,000 tickets by last Friday - more than the entire number it sold in 1999.\nReligious satire prominent.\nAustralian comic Wil Anderson lays into the Catholic Church, including a send up of the late Pope John Paul II. \"Breaking the Pope\" is about the infamous Magdalene laundries, religious-run workhouses for women in Ireland that existed until the mid-90s. \"Mary and The Stripper\" contrasts the tales of Mary Magdalene and a 21st-century stripper hooked on heroin.\nDanish-Egyptian comedian Omar Marzouk performs a standup routine on the Prophet Mohammed cartoon controversy.\n\"We Don't Know Shi'ite\", uses vox pops in the streets of Britain to highlight ignorance about Islam. The play's director Joshua Blackstone said, \"Britain could work so much better as a multi-ethnic society if people were more open-minded. We could put to rest the stereotypes if there is more understanding,\"\nRev Donald Reid, a spokesman for the Festival of Spirituality and Peace, a religious gathering that runs alongside the Fringe, welcomed the focus on religion, calling it a reflection of an upsurge in the thirst for faith and spirituality. \n\"Artists are testing the boundaries of how far they can go ... But religion should be able to be commented on and its absurdities pointed out.\", he said.\nIn \"Bible Babel Live!\" the Bible is read, in English, Greek and Chinese, from start to finish in 80 hours over 10 days .\nSpeaking of the religious motif, the festival director Paul Gudgin said, \"Clearly it's a very personal subject that artists and writers currently feel a particular need to explore,\". \n\"It's either about what is happening with radical Islam or reflects interest and concern over the influence Evangelical Christians seem to be having in the United States,\" he told Reuters. Pointing to a \"Da Vinci Syndrome\", he said, \"All of a sudden, these topics are of huge interest. What has surprised me is the breadth of shows on offer.\".\nThe religious theme received further impetus from the Racial and Religious Hatred Act introduced in the UK, which sought to give all faiths equal protection, was condemned by comedians such as Rowan Atkinson who feared it would turn satire into a criminal offence.\nReligion and politics mix.\n\"Jesus: The Guantanamo Years\" is a one-man show by Abie Philbin Bowman, is playing to sell-out houses. In the show, Bowman plays Jesus, a bearded Middle Eastern man arrested by U.S. immigration officials and sent to the Guantanamo detention center in Cuba after confessing he was ready to die as a martyr.\nBowman says comedy can be an effective weapon if used responsibly. \"Being Irish and having grown up in the 1980s I have a sense of my own culture having been hijacked by terrorists and people assuming all Irish were terrorists,\" he said.\n\"Petrol Jesus Nightmare\", from the Traverse Theatre Company features two Israeli soldiers holed up under fire, an apocalyptic thriller about the violent consequences of faith has been seen as \"prescient\" of the ongoing Middle-east violence. \n\"The Black Jew Dialogues\" and \"According to Jesus\" were other shows on offer. \"The Situation Comedy\" is a play from Israel about a suicide bombing written and performed by Robbie Gringras. According to Gringras, it was inspired by true events, including suicide bombings in Israel.\nThe Scotsman newspaper's theater critic Joyce McMillan called the Fringe \"the most amazing barometer of world politics,\" The Fringe tackled terrorism last year, following the July 2005 London bombings.\nIn \"Breasts and Burgers\", a surrealist spectacle adapted from a play by 20th-century avant-gardist Guillaume Apolliniare - the US flag is ripped apart onstage each night. Cecile Shea, the US consul in Scotland, has said the play could cause hurt to ordinary Americans. \nDirector Richard Franklin defended it as a comment on freedom of speech. \"The most serious thing to come out of the war on terror is the excuse to create legislation against this freedom (of speech)\" he told the Herald newspaper, \"It is a symbolic thing and is intended as such.\"\nAn American tourist John McCabe visiting Edinburgh was unconvinced, saying \"It seems the Stars and Stripes is an acceptable target in this liberal environment,\" and \"I doubt the desecration of the Koran on stage would be tolerated. Free speech is one thing, but where's the proportionality? I certainly would not go and see this play.\"\nControversy over Churchill's cigar.\nActor Mel Smith, who plays Winston Churchill in \"Allegiance\" had to go without lighting the trademark cigar, as smoking in an enclosed public space is now a crime in Scotland. Officials threatened to close down the theater, the Assembly Rooms, if he lit up.\n\"I think it's absurd. In the context of an international festival like this, it's crazy. It's integral to the part of Churchill and it doesn't affect other people - it's just absurd.\", William Burdett-Coutts, who runs the Assembly Rooms, said.\nFunding woes.\nOrganisers of the Show have called for more funding, both from public sources as well as from private businesses, to help the show. \nAnthony Alderson, the director of The Pleasance, told \"The Scotsman\" newspaper that without further private sector funding the Fringe could start to shrink and lose its standing as the world's best festival. He feared that the current rate of expansion is unsustainable without further support from businesses. The Fringe \ndirector Paul Gudgin said last year that the Festival would need to make a string of cutbacks if it was to combat major losses.\nThe Fringe Society currently receives only \u00a345,000 a year from the city council and \u00a325,000 from the Scottish Arts Council. \nGudgin also called for an urgent Scottish Executive response to the \"Thundering Hooves\" report into the future of Edinburgh's festivals, published this May. It pointed out that the festivals contribute \u00a3184 million a year to the Scottish economy and stressed the need for continued investment, long-term planning, and international promotion to beat off competition from other cities. \nThe Edinburgh City Council responded within a month with the announcement of a \u00a31m fund for the various festivals. Some have argued that this money was already in the pipeline.\nFees go up.\nThe Edinburgh City Council has announced increases in theatre licence fees, which venues must pay before holding a show. For venues with 200 seats or less, fees go up from \u00a3127 in 2005 to \u00a3440 this year, \u00a3620 next year and \u00a3800 in 2008. For venues seating more than a thousand, fees went up from \u00a3295 last year to \u00a31,320 this year.\nThe Fringe Society, which represents the festivals managers and performers said it was \"deeply concerned about the council's decision to make these sharp increases in theatre licence prices\", adding that \"particularly the smaller venues who will suffer,\". \nThe Council said new laws meant the costs of its licensing scheme had to be recovered from venues. Councillor Jack O'Donnell, convener of the licensing regulatory committee, said the scheme had been operating at a deficit of \u00a3177,000."}

Michael McCulloch and colleagues used three Labrador Retrievers and two Portuguese Water Dogs, both common pets, that received basic behavioral dog training. The researchers trained the dogs to lie down next to a sample from a cancer patient and to ignore other samples.\nThe samples used were breath samples from 55 patients with lung cancer and 31 with breast cancer \u2014 the two types of cancer with the highest mortality rates in the United States.\nAfter the training phase, the dogs' accuracy diagnosis was tested in a double-blind experiment. Among lung cancer patients, the sensitivity and specificity were 99% accurate and for breast cancer sensitivity was 88% and specificity 98%. Because these figures seem almost too good to be true, cancer experts are the same time baffled and skeptical. The authors of the study themselves also say replication of the study is needed.\nImportantly, this was independent of the cancer stage, meaning the dogs were able to pick up the scent of cancer in its early stages. This is important because in many cases, the success of any treatment depends on early diagnosis. However, the researchers don't believe this will lead to the use of dogs in the clinic soon, rather they want to find out which chemicals are actually sensed by the canines, because they could be used in laboratory assays. \"It's not like someone would start chemotherapy based on a dog test,\" Dr. Gansler of the American Cancer Society said, \"They'd still get a biopsy.\".\nThe researchers were inspired by anecdotal reports about dogs detecting cancer. In 1989, a British women consulted with her family physician because her Dalmatian kept licking a mole on her leg. At biopsy it showed to be malignant melanoma. When diagnosed too late this form of cancer has a poor survival rate, but in this case early surgery was made possible, and the women survived. Prior studies showed that breath samples from patients with lung cancer or breast cancer contain distinct biochemical markers. This provides a basis for the hypothesis that some cancer types produce volatile chemicals that dogs could smell. A study published in the British Medical Journal already proved that dogs could use their exquisite sense of smell to detect bladder cancer in urine samples, but they were only correct in 41% of cases, and another study provided preliminary evidence that dogs could detect melanomas.\nThis doesn't mean you can show your breasts to your dog and it will tell you if you have cancer, other physicians caution, and scientists do not advise people to train their dogs to sniff for cancer. Unresolved issues from the study include the fact that subjects were required to breathe deeper than normal, so it's not sure whether dogs can smell cancer in normal breath. Also, whether this is a permanent skill that would be retained by dogs was not tested. \nFinally, there are concerns that could arise over liability issues: who would be responsible when the dog makes a mistake?\nCurrent detection methods for both lung and breast cancer are not flawless. For lung cancer, chest X-ray and sputum cytology (detecting cancer cells in coughed up fluid) fail to detect many early cases, and CT scan produces many false-positive results unless combined with expensive PET scans. Although it might be comparing apples and oranges, a $2.5 million CT scanner has an accuracy of 85 to 90%. Mammography also produces false-positive results, and it may be difficult in women with dense breast tissue. As such, another type of \"pet\"-scan, using dogs as a biological assay, might prove feasible for screening if supported by further research. Current tests are also expensive so the use of dogs for preliminary cancer testing could prove to be an affordable alternative for countries in the developing world. "}

The hearing will determine whether four current U.S. soldiers have to face a court martial hearing; an additional former soldier allegedly involved in the incident, Steven D. Green, was recently discharged from the military and has pleaded not guilty to rape and murder charges in federal court in Kentucky. \nAccording to Bierce, a U.S. Special Agent investigating the incident, the brutal attack which saw Abeer Qassim al-Janabi slain and her parents and younger sister murdered was premeditated. Citing a sworn statement from Army Specialist James Barker, the five accused were said to have plotted the rape whilst drinking whisky and playing cards.\nAccording to Agent Bierce, Spc. Barker said that Pte. Spielman grabbed the girl while Pte. Green seized her father and they then took them into the house and Sgt. Cortez and Spc. Barker followed them inside.\nPte. Green supposedly led the father, mother and younger sister into the bedroom and closed the door, while the teenage girl remained in the living room with the other Americans, Spc. Barker's statement said.\nSgt. Cortez then allegedly pushed the girl to the floor, pulled up her dress and tore off her underwear while she was struggling, Bierce said, again citing Spc. Barker's statement. Sgt. Cortez appeared to then rape Abeer and afterward, Spc. Barker tried to rape the girl, the statement said.\nThen Pte. Green came out of the bedroom with an AK-47 rifle and announced: \"They're all dead. I just killed them,\" according to Spc. Barker's statement.\nThen Sgt. Cortez held Abeer down while Pte. Green raped the girl; according to Spc. Barker's statement. Pte. Green then picked up the AK-47 and shot Abeer once, waited, and then shot her a few more times, the U.S. official, Agent Bierce, said, quoting from Spc. Barker's statement.\nSpc. Barker said that he then poured kerosene lamp fuel on the girl's body but Barker did not say who set it on fire.\nGary Griesmyer, another Special Agent, quoted Sgt. Cortez as telling him that the teenage girl was crying and talking in Arabic and that Spc. Barker told her to \"shut up.\"\nPrivate Justin Watt testified that Pte. Howard told him before the incident that Pte. Green, Sgt. Cortez and Spc. Barker were planning to rape a girl, and Pte. Howard was going to be the lookout. \nWatt testified that he heard Mr. Green say, \"I want to kill and hurt a lot of Iraqis.\" Green has been discharged from the military and has pleaded not guilty in a federal court in Kentucky where he will stand trial; he will not be facing a court martial regardless of what occurrs in the Baghdad hearing.\n\"If you have the power to make something right, you should do it. Investigation is not my job. But if something went down -- something terrible like that -- then it's my obligation to come forward,\" Watt said.\nWatt also said life for some of the soldiers in the B Company, 1st Battalion, 502nd Infantry Regiment, was horrible while they were manning a military post in nearby Yusufiyah. Some lived in a \"dilapidated, abandoned water treatment facility\" he said.\nPfc. Watt, who is identified as the whistle-blowing soldier who disclosed the attack during a counseling session, also said; \"I feared for my safety at the TCP (traffic control point). It's like this, I find out that guys in my squad, guys I trusted with my life, are allegedly responsible for one of the most brutal rapes/murders I've ever seen. And everyone has a weapon and grenades.\"\nPfc. Justin Cross testified that deadly attacks by insurgents sapped morale and raised combat stress in the U.S. Army unit that included the soldiers accused of raping and murdering Abeer. He said that the \"mentally draining\" living conditions of the combat unit was a factor.\n\"It drives you nuts. You feel like every step you might get blown up. You just hit a point where you're like, 'If I die today, I die.' You're just walking a death walk.\" Pfc. Cross told the hearing.\nAn article 32 hearing, like this, seeks to determine if a soldiers should face court martial. Its similar to that of a preliminary hearing or a grand jury proceeding in civilian law."}

The person was confirmed deceased at 17:20. At 19:45 service resumed from Liverpool Street and White City. There was severe delays on the Central line until the close of traffic.[sic]\"\nThe incident affected the Underground's Central Line between Liverpool Street Station and White City Station. According to Underground staff, the Central Line service on this route was suspended at 17:20 local time. On stations that connect to the Central Line, passengers were informed that \"service for the Central Line is suspended until further notice\" and that their \"...tickets will be valid for all local traffic.\" In addition to announcements over loudspeaker, passengers were advised of the interruption with notices on white boards inside of most stations in Central London. While Marble Arch Station was closed off, additional buses were made available by the city to carry Underground passengers from Central Line connection points like Bond Street Station to their intended destinations. \nThe scene outside of Marble Arch station brought back memories of last year's train bombings: Underground staff, as well as police officers blocked the entrance to the station, and advised passengers to use alternate means of transportation; meanwhile, vehicles from the London Underground Emergency Response Unit, as well as police cars were standing by outside the station. \nBritish Trasport Police did not release further details about the accident.\nBy 20:00 local time, London Underground staff confirmed that service on the Central Line had been fully restored. \"Yes, they're all open\" said an Underground associate when asked whether Marble Arch Station had resumed service. By 23:00 local time, however, the Central Line service still reported \"severe delays\" on some stations. On Thursday, August 10th, the Central Line was operating normally again, but the service interruption was overshadowed by the breaking news regarding a plot to detonate explosives on airplanes flying from the UK to the United States.\nTrain accidents on the Tube are not uncommon: the London Underground reports 53 injuries last year and continues to advise passengers to \"mind the gap between the train and the platform\" when trains arrive, and to \"stand clear of the closing doors,\" in order to help ensure a safe journey. In addition, passengers are also advised to carry a bottle of water with them on hot days to avoid heat-related injuries and to remember to \"take all their belongings with them when [they] leave the train, in order to avoid station closures and security alerts.\"\nThe closure of Marble Arch Station was not the only service interruption on Wednesday; according to its web site, London Underground reports that Baker Street Station was also closed down due to a gas leak.

Israel took control of the strategic southern Lebanese hub of Marjayoun on Thursday as part of its northern push.\nIsrael ratcheted up its fight against Hezbollah, beginning operations aimed at the heart of Beirut, taking control of a largely Christian southern Lebanese town, named Marjeyoun. The Israeli military also dropped leaflets in Beirut, warning of expanded operations inside the capital and urging people in southern Shiite neighborhoods to evacuate. Those neighborhoods have been bastions of support for Hezbollah. \"To the people who live in Hay El Soulom, Borj El Barajneh, Shiyah ... For your safety,\" one flier warned. \"You must evacuate these areas immediately and evacuate any area from where Hezbollah and its members or their assistants are launching their terrorist operations. \"Be aware!\"\nOther Israeli troops also advanced on the town of Khiam. Israeli jets also struck a lighthouse used as a cell phone communications tower in central Beirut. Witnesses said they saw a man being loaded into an ambulance at the scene. There was no immediate information on his condition. The area, located in an upscale neighborhood where slain former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri lived, is outside the Hezbollah-dominated southern suburbs that Israeli forces have targeted up to now.\nIsraeli troops had warned residents to remain in their homes as forces moved toward the nearby town of Blatt, Lebanese military intelligence and police said. The secured area overlooks the Litani River, where Hezbollah fighters have reportedly launched rockets into Israel, sources said.\nOn Wednesday, the Israeli government approved a plan to widen the war in Lebanon in an attempt to destroy Hezbollah installations and neutralize its ability to launch rockets. The cabinet has authorized the Israeli army to advance as far north as the Litani River, 30 kilometres (18 miles) north of the Lebanese-Israeli border. However, Israel says yesterday's push is not part of that campaign.\n\"It's a small operation that looks large from where we're looking right now, but this is not opening up any new front,\" IDF spokeswoman Miri Eisen said. \"It's taking care of one that has been consistently hitting Kiryat Shmona.\"\nHezbollah officials reacted angrily to the Israeli cabinet's decision. Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah appeared on Al-Manar television, and threatened to make southern Lebanon \"a graveyard\" for the Israelis.\n\"I say to the Zionists, you could come anywhere, invade, land airborne forces, enter this village or that, but I repeat, all this will cost you a high price,\" he said.\nThe Israeli army says 15 of its soldiers were killed in combat on Wednesday, and that 40 Hezbollah fighters died the same day. Hezbollah fired more than 100 rockets into Israel, while no casualties from the Israeli side were reported. \nThe IDF says it currerntly has approximately 10,000 troops on the ground in southern Lebanon, a number that will swell to 50,000 in coming days. \nAs the fighting continues, U.S. sources said they no longer expect that a joint U.S.-French UN draft resolution calling for a ceasefire in Lebanon would reach a Security Council vote by a hoped for Thursday deadline. Disagreement over whether the resolution should call for an immediate Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon is an obstacle. \nThe resolution was to be co-sponsored by the United States and France, but the two countries are now at odds over how to reword the proposal in light of Arab objections to the original draft. The French have accepted a Lebanese offer to send 15,000 troops into the south to monitor the ceasefire if Israel withdraws immediately, while the U.S. wants Israel to be able to remain in southern Lebanon for a few weeks until a new multi-national force arrives. \nMore than 1000 Lebanese, mostly civilians, have died in the month-long conflict according to Lebanon's government. 100 Israelis, mostly soldiers, have also been killed."}

The planned attacks might have been the biggest terrorist attacks since 9/11, government officials have said. Information gathered after recent arrests in Pakistan convinced British investigators they had to act urgently to stop the plot. The original information about the plan came from the Muslim community in Britain, according to a British intelligence official. The tip resulted from a person who had been concerned about the activities of an acquaintance after the July 7, 2005 terror attacks in London, the official said.\nThe counter-terrorism operation took several months to complete. Scotland Yard said twenty-three people are in custody, and were arrested in north and east London, Birmingham and High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire. An undercover British agent infiltrated the group, giving the authorities intelligence on the alleged plan, several U.S. government officials said. The men had not bought plane tickets, the officials said, but they were in the process of perusing the Internet to find flights to various cities that had similar departure times. Pakistani officials have said two Britons were arrested last week, and that five Pakistanis have been detained on suspicion of \"facilitating\" the plot. As many as 50 people were involved in the plot, an internal Department of Homeland Security document said.\nSpeaking on the day after the arrests, UK Home Secretary John Reid said although officials believed the main suspects were in custody, the UK threat level remained \"critical\", the highest level. He said UK citizens faced a \"common threat\" and appealed for tolerance and resilience. He also added that Britain was grateful for Pakistan's cooperation in breaking up the suspected plot. \nAfter the arrests, Paul Stephenson, the Metropolitan Police's Deputy Assistant Commissioner, said: \"We are confident that we have disrupted a plan by terrorists to cause untold death and destruction and to commit, quite frankly, mass murder. We believe that the terrorists' aim was to smuggle explosives on to aeroplanes in hand luggage and to detonate these in flight. We also believe that the intended targets were flights from the United Kingdom to the United States of America. I can confirm that a significant number of people are currently in custody and the operation is ongoing.\" U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security, Michael Chertoff, said it was unclear if all suspects were now in custody. U.S. and British officials said some suspects could still be on the loose and that investigations were continuing.\nPrime Minister Tony Blair, who is currently holidaying in the Caribbean, paid tribute to the security services and the police. \"I thank them for the great job they are doing in protecting our country. There has been an enormous amount of co-operation with the U.S. authorities which has been of great value and underlines the threat we face and our determination to counter it,\" he said in a statement.\nThe White House has said the plot had been a direct threat to the U.S., and security officials there say aspects of the plan were suggestive of al-Qaeda. Terrorism analyst Peter Bergen said two factors pointed to the influence of al-Qaeda. He said the organization is \"obsessed\" with commercial aviation, and he added that the timing of the plot was \"very interesting.\" \"It's not clear when this was going to be implemented ... but we are coming up on the fifth anniversary of 9/11. They do want to make a big statement,\" he said. \nU.S. intelligence officials said the plotters hoped to stage a dry run by August 10, and the actual attack would have followed days later, the officials told the Associated Press. It is believed that terrorists planned to detonate explosives on three U.S. airliners. A U.S. administration official said the plot targeted Continental Airlines, United, British Airways and American Airlines flights to New York, Washington and California.\nA senior U.S. intelligence official suggests that those arrested are British citizens, and some have links with Pakistan. Among those arrested were a Muslim charity worker and a Heathrow Airport employee with an all-area access pass, according to Britain's Channel 4. The suspected terrorists had been under surveillance in Britain since last December, the channel reported. According to ABC News, five more suspects who are still at large in Britain are being \"urgently sought\". At a press conference at the afternoon on August 10, Home Secretary John Reid said the police believe the \"main players\" are accounted for. Two of the suspects left \"martyrdom tapes,\" according to Pakistani sources familiar with the details of the British investigation. \nA senior U.S. congressional source said it is believed the plotters planned to mix a British sports drink with a gel-like substance to make an explosive that they would possibly trigger with an MP3 player or cell phone. The sports drink could be combined with a peroxide-based paste to form a potent \"explosive cocktail,\" if properly done, said a U.S. counterterrorism official. \"There are strong reasons to believe the materials in a beverage like that could have been part of the formula,\" the official said. \"What makes it frightening is the sophistication to turn relatively common materials into a dangerous bomb,\" said a U.S. intelligence official. \nTwo of the suspects held in connection with the alleged plot to down commercial jetliners with explosives may have had contact with a Pakistani suspected of being an al Qaeda operative, government officials in Britain and the United States said. The officials allege that Matiur Rehman, described as an explosives expert in Pakistan who is now at large, met two of the British suspects in Pakistan. But officials, who say the plot displays signs of al Qaeda participation but are still investigating that angle, do not know whether Rehman was involved in the plot. After the two people returned to Britain, they received a wire transfer of money from Pakistan, the officials said.\nMichael Chertoff, the US Secretary of Homeland Security, said the plan was reminiscent of the 1995 plot by 9/11 coordinator Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, who envisioned detonating bombs on 11 airlines possibly traveling over the Pacific Ocean. He also said that the plotters were \"getting close to the execution phase\". \nThe U.S. is also sending out more air marshals on flights between the UK and the U.S. President Bush said the arrests are a \"stark reminder\" that the U.S. is \"at war with Islamic fascists.\" He thanked British Prime Minister Tony Blair for \"busting this plot.\" U.S. government officials say there were two phone calls made from London to the United States recently by suspects. Those calls were tracked down and investigated, but there is no evidence of any involvement of people in America in the alleged plot.\nThe U.S. Embassy in New Delhi on August 11 warned American citizens of possible terrorist attacks across India in the week from August 14 to August 20.\nFlights disrupted.\nMI5, the British internal security service, has raised the threat level to critical, meaning \"an attack is expected imminently and indicates an extremely high level of threat to the UK\".\nAs a result, increased security at all British airports have been implemented, leading to delays in departing flights.\nSignificant disruptions include: \nAir passengers across Europe faced a second day of delays on August 11, though the situation had eased from the previous day when London's Heathrow Airport was closed to many incoming flights.\nSecurity restrictions.\nThe alleged plot to smuggle liquid explosives onto planes has led to drastic new security measures at airports around the world.\nAll airlines departing from UK airports have told their passengers that they are not permitted to carry any hand baggage on board any aircraft departing from any airport in the UK.\nOnly the following items are permitted in the cabin, and must be carried in transparent bags:\nNo fluids at all are allowed onboard. \"We hope that these measures, which are being kept under review by the government, will need to be in place for a limited period only,\" said a statement issued by the Department for Transport.\nWeblog journalists have criticized whether the physical handling of potential explosive liquids reflects the threat authorities claim. In response to CNN reporting, \"Because the plot involved taking liquid explosives aboard planes in carry-ons, passengers at all U.S. and British airports, and those boarding U.S.-bound flights at other international airports, are banned from taking any liquids onto planes.\" XOPL observes, \"And then they have the photo of the TSA guy dumping a tub of confiscated possibly explosive liquids into a garbage can in a crowd of people. ... Nevermind that the plot specifically mentions mixing chemicals and/or nitroglycerin... which explodes if handled too roughly.\" Responding to \"A.J. Leoni, pours the last of her drink into the receptacle while in line for the security checkpoint at the Asheville Regional Airport,\" in the Asheville Citizen-Times, Gabriel Meister writes, \"\"Pour it into a receptacle?\" Don't you think that some of these potentially explosive liquids might be more dangerous when, I don't know, mixed in a big vat in the middle of an airport?\"\nThe United States Department of Homeland Security said in an email: \"The U.S. threat level is raised to Severe, or Red, for all commercial flights flying from the United Kingdom to the U.S. The U.S. threat level is raised to High, or Orange for all commercial aviation operating in the U.S., including international flights. Flights from the U.S. to the U.K. are also Orange. PROHIBITED ITEMS CHANGE: All liquids and gels are now prohibited at the screening checkpoints. For more information please visit www.tsa.gov.\" Continental, Delta, Northwest and United Airlines advised passengers to arrive three hours before takeoff for domestic and international flights, according to the airlines' Web sites. American Airlines advised passengers to allow for \"extra time.\" Passengers in the U.S. faced a second security check starting August 11.\nThe nation's overall terror threat level has not been altered. August 10 2006 was the first time the Department of Homeland Security has raised the threat level for a specific group of flights. British Airways canceled all short haul flights in or out of Heathrow Airport for August 10, 2006, and delays were stacking flights up at airports across Europe.\nMassachusetts Governor Mitt Romney ordered the National Guard to Boston's Logan Airport, and California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger ordered the National Guard to airports in his state.\nThe United States on August 11 renewed its warning to U.S. citizens to defer non-essential travel to Pakistan amid rising concerns over terror activity that would be directed against U.S. interests.\nBank accounts frozen.\nThe Bank of England has notified financial institutions to freeze accounts of 19 people under terrorist financing laws, according to a statement on the Bank's web site. The individuals were identified as Ali Abdula Ahmed, Ali Cossor, ALI Shazad Khuram, Hussain Nabeel, Hussain Tanvir, Hussain Umair, Islam Umar, Kayani Waseem, Khan Assan Abdullah, Khan Waheed Arafat, Khatib Osman Adam, Patel Abdul Muneem, Rauf Tayib, Saddique Muhammed Usman, Sarwar Assad, Savant Ibrahim, Tariq Amin, Asmin, Uddin Shamin Mohammed, and Zaman Waheed."}

Sources say that Israeli prime minister Ehud Olmert will bring the UN resolution to cabinet for discussion on Sunday. Daniel Ayalon, Israel's ambassador to the United States, said that his government was likely to agree to the resolution.\n\"I do not want to preempt the Cabinet decision, but the language as I see it now \u2014 and I'm being careful \u2014 if the language of the resolution doesn't change, I view this resolution very positively and, of course, the crux is implementation,\" Ayalon said. \"If this resolution will be enforced, then we solve the problem of Lebanon,\" said the Israeli envoy.\nHezbollah officials have not responded to the UN action. The Lebanese cabinet meets Saturday to discuss the resolution.\nLebanese leaders have cautiously welcomed the resolution which had been delayed for almost a week due to negotiations over its wording. U.N. Ambassador Nouhad Mahmoud of Lebanon said; \"The Lebanese are not comfortable with the Israeli distinctions of what is defensive and what is offensive.\" \nThe resolution calls for Hezbollah to end its attacks on Israel and for Israel to end \"offensive military operations\" in Lebanon. It also raises the strength of the UN peacekeepers in Lebanon, the (Unifil), from 2,000 to a maximum of 15,000, and gives it an expanded mandate to enforce the ceasefire. A portion of the UN language expanding that force's Chapter 6 mandate reads: \"Acting in support of a request from the government of Lebanon to deploy an international force to assist it to exercise its authority throughout the territory, authorizes Unifil to take all necessary action in areas of deployment of its forces and as it deems within its capabilities, to ensure that its area of operations is not utilized for hostile activities of any kind... \"\nThe U.S. Secretary of State, Condoleezza Rice, responding on Friday during an interview with \"\" to the difference between a UN Chapter 7 mandate, and the current mandate for Unifil in Lebanon said: So this force has a big mandate, it has a robust mandate, it has a mandate that will allow it to defend itself and to defend that mandate. But it's never been the expectation that this force is going to disarm Hezbollah. That will have to be done by the Lebanese...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;...Chapter 7 is very often used when a government is not prepared to accept a force. Lebanon is prepared to accept this force, but this is an absolutely robust mandate. This, by the way, is what helped the Israeli government. They were concerned earlier about the mandate. After we talked about this enhanced mandate in the revised resolution, I think the government of Israel saw that it met their needs.\nIsrael is to withdraw its troops from southern Lebanon as UN and Lebanese troops are deployed. The resolution outlines plans for the disarmament of Hezbollah and for a settlement of the Israeli-Lebanese border.\nThe UN also called for the unconditional release by Hezbollah of two Israeli soldiers it captured on July 12th, precipitating the conflict.\n123 Israelis, including 40 civilians, and 861 Lebanese, mostly civilians, have been killed in the 31-day old war."}

For Gevaert, who already won the 100m sprint three days ago and held third place in the world ranking, 22.68 seconds in the 200 metres was enough to haul in a second golden medal. Russians Yuliya Gushchina (22.93) and Natalya Ruskova (23.09) had to settle for silver and bronze. Hellebaut jumped over 2.01 metres and then only needed one attempt to cross 2.03 metres, unexpectedly winning the high jump event. Favourite Kajsa Bergqvist only finished third, after Venelina Veneva from Bulgaria, who also made 2.03 metres but needed two jumps to succeed.\nAs Gevaert crossed the finish line cheering, Hellebaut came to congratulate her carrying a Belgian flag. Indeed, the victory of the two 28-year old Belgian women was historical: while Hellebaut bettered the Belgian record, Gevaert was the first Belgian athlete ever to win two golden medals at the European championships. The last women to crown herself in both sprint events was Russian Irina Privalova in 1994. Francis Obikwelu also brought in a sprint double victory for Portugal on Thursday.\nGevaert credited her victory partly to Hellebaut's medal: \"I screamed when my friend Tia won the high jump,\" Gevaert told the gathered European press. \"Seeing her gave me so much motivation two minutes before my own start.\" And she continued: \"I wonder what is going on right now in Belgium with three gold medals. It is wonderful for such a small country.\" Hellebaut admitted that her achievement was \"...beyond all expectations.\"\nGevaert succeeds Muriel Hurtis as European Champion. Hurtis didn't make it past the semi-finals. Four years ago, it was Hurtis who held off Gevaert, who had to settle for silver then. \"I was a lot better than four years ago in Munich, when I was four years younger and much more nervous,\" Gevaert explained."}

Under the current system patients must visit a Medicare office to receive their rebates.\nJohn Howard said the 80,000 people per day who queue at Medicare offices will no longer need to spend their lunch break in line at Medicare.\nAccording to the government, doctors who bulk-bill their patients through Medicare will benefit through faster payments and reduced paperwork. \"If it\u2019s a bulk bill transaction; all they do is hand over their Medicare card,\" said Mr Hockey.\n\"The Medicare card is swiped in the EFTPOS device, all is done.\"\n\"Doctors will be rebated within 24 hours.\"\n\"Currently doctors are rebated up to 14 days for bulk bill claims.\"\nThe government claims that electronic rebates will be less expensive to process\u2014costing only a few cents, compared to an estimated AUD $3.50 for an over-the-counter transaction.

The government will be requiring them to sell the farms as part of its land redistribution programme. \nAgriculture and Land Affairs Minister Lulu Xingwana said that if no agreement in reached in 6 months, the government could expropriate farmlands. Stating that negotiations have been too slow, in some cases taking many years, Xingwana said that some farm owners were seeking \"unrealistic prices\". Land owners claim they are not offered market value for their property. \nThe government has identified about 350 farms for which, if no deal is reached, the government will force a mandatory sale at current market prices identified by the government. \nOfficials said that expropriation is only a measure of last-resort and that farmers can appeal the decision in court. \nThe land reform programme aims to hand back land or give financial compensation to black South Africans who were forcibly removed from their ancestral homes and lands under apartheid rule. The programme was a key promise made by the African National Congress (ANC) as it came to power in 1994 and remains an emotive and politically charged issue.\nCurrently, about 4% of South Africa's farm land is owned by blacks, who number 42 million out of the nation's 47 million population. President Thabo Mbeki's government has set a target of transferring 30% of land to blacks by 2014. About 89% of the nearly 80,000 claims have been settled so far, and the government has spent some R2.5bn ($368m) purchasing farms from white owners. The National Land Claims Commission is entrusted with carrying out the transfers.\nThe reform programme had so far followed a \"willing-buyer willing-seller\" principle. The process had to contend with land owners challenging the validity of some claims, negotiating sale prices with current owners, and settling competing claims over the same piece of land\u2014sometimes by tracing family trees of claimants when other documents supporting the claim did not exist. \nXingwana called on established farmers to form partnerships with new landowners and to transfer skills to new farmers, to ensure productive use of transferred lands. One criticism of the programme is that some of the transferred farms have fallen in production due to the inexperience and lack of capital among the new owners. \nThe government has rejected comparisons of the programme with that initiated in Zimbabwe under President Robert Mugabe.

In attendance will be Bill and Melinda Gates, Bill Clinton, Richard Gere, Olympia Dukakis and Sandra Oh.\nThe theme of the conference is \"Time to Deliver\" and is meant to focus attention on the need to meet past promises to increase funding for treatment, care and prevention. The conference began on August 13th and is scheduled to end on August 18th.\nThere is growing frustration with the failure of developed countries to provide drugs to combat the AIDS crisis in the developing world, particularly Africa. \n\"What the Western world has to do is deliver on its promises, which it never does. It always betrays the people of Africa,\" Stephen Lewis, the UN secretary general's special envoy for HIV-AIDS in Africa, told CBC News.\nIn the week leading up to the conference, Microsoft founder and philanthropist Bill Gates announced a donation of US$500 million spread over five years to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. Gates and former US President Bill Clinton will be sharing the podium during this week's conference. \nInternational AIDS conferences have usually been attended by world leaders, particularly the leader of the host country. Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper has been criticized for snubbing the conference by sending his health minister, Tony Clement, to attend in his place. The prime minister, who is touring Canada's far north this week, officially declined his invitation to attend three weeks ago.\n\"It's a dreadful mistake in political judgment, and it's not excusable,\" said Lewis, who was Canada's Ambassador to the United Nations in the 1980s. \"It's a lost opportunity to tell the world how Canada feels about this pandemic.\n\"The Arctic sovereignty issue will still be there on August 18 (when the AIDS conference ends),\" said Lewis. \"Forty million people worldwide carry this virus, and most will die preventable deaths. What greater scourge is there than that?\"\nThis is the second major international event Canada has hosted which Harper has snubbed. Last month, he did not appear in Montreal for the 2006 World Outgames, a celebration of elite gay, lesbian, and transgendered athletes. \nThe AIDS conference is expected to be the largest in history and will be ten times the size of the first which was held in Atlanta in 1985. It has become a biennial event and is convened by the International AIDS Society (IAS), an independent association of HIV professionals, with more than 7,000 members from 153 countries."}

Further, the magazine claims that the nation could find \"plenty more if they look\", calling for privatisation of national oil companies to help increase oil production.\nThe language is provocative - the world has plenty of oil, and only requires sufficient investment and exploration to find it. This is a line that \"The Economist\" has held for some time, certainly since before its now infamous March 1999 issue proclaiming that we were \"drowning in oil\" and featuring a prediction of US$5 per barrel. That issue was followed by an embarrassing retraction in December of that year, as oil started its steady climb. It now sits above US$70 per barrel.\nHowever, petroleum geologists and energy investment specialists maintain a different view of oil reserves. They say that there is a limit to what is in the ground, and further to that, a limit to how much of it we can retrieve even with advancing technology. Just how much is down there can't be said with any certainty, for a variety of reasons. A big one is the suspicious reserves figures given by producers in the Middle East, including Saudi Arabia. Since OPEC starting using a quota system based on reserves, the estimated reserves for member nations has magically risen, and even continued rising in the face of increased extraction from those reserves.\nAmongst those who deal with the physical realities of oil fields, forecasts of a peak in production vary between 30 years, as the USA's Energy Information Administration suggest, and now, as suggested by the Association for the Study of Peak Oil and Gas and other more pessimistic forecasters. A peak in production would then be followed by decline. Certainly, in the petroleum world, there is no serious suggestion of sustaining the current level of oil production for 70 years."}

The swans were sampled on August 8, 2006 and the initial testing was done at Michigan State University's Diagnostic Center for Population and Animal Health and at the National Veterinary Services laboratories in Ames, Iowa.\nWhite House Press Secretary Tony Snow says that \"They (the scientists) believe it is a strain of low pathogenicity, similar to strains that have been seen before in North America.\"\nSnow also added that \"this [case] is not what we're accustomed to hearing about from Asia.\"\n\"Test results thus far indicate this is low pathogenicity avian influenza, which poses no threat to human health. Routine surveillance has indicated the presence of H5 and N1 avian influenza subtypes in samples from two wild mute swans in Michigan,\" said a statement on the United States Department of Agriculture's (USDA) website.\nThe statement also went on to say that the swans \"did not show signs of sickness\" and that the swans were infected with \"two separate\" strains of Avian Flu.\n\"It is possible that these birds were not infected with an H5N1 strain, but instead with two separate avian influenza viruses, one containing H5 and the other containing N1,\" said the statement.\n\"This is not the highly pathogenic avian influenza virus that has spread through much of other parts of the world. We do not believe this virus represents a risk to human health,\" said USDA's Animal and Plant Health inspector, Ron DeHaven.\nHealth officials are remaining \"remaining vigilant and prepared,\" said Department of Health and Human Services science advisor, Dr. William Raub.\nFurther tests will be done to confirm that there is in fact a virus there and what type and are expected sometime today.\n\"The confirmatory testing underway at NVSL will clarify whether one or more strains of the virus are present, the specific subtype, as well as pathogenicity,\" said that statement but also said that it could take \"up to two weeks and will be made public when completed.\" The statement also said that the \"testing suggests\" the strain is of low pathogenicity, but that these tests do \"not confirm\" the findings.\nThe virus turned up two times in the U.S. The first case was in 1971 and the second in 1986.

A request was made to New York State Supreme court Judge Justice Rose Sconiers, the judge to preside over the case, to discuss a \"timetable\" for resubmission, but the court \"decided not to,\" said attorney Arthur Giacalone who represents the plaintiffs in the lawsuit.\nThe hotel would require the demolition of at least five properties, 1109-1121 Elmwood and would cause the closure of several businesses. Already, two businesses, Skunk Tail Glass and Six Nations Native American Gift Shop have relocated, outside the Elmwood Strip. Don apparel, H.O.D. Tattoo and Mondo Video still remain on Elmwood; however, Mondo Video is planning on moving to a new location. The hotel will be 72 rooms and will cost at least 7 million dollars to build. Wyndham Hotels is expected to be the owner/operator of the hotel. The properites are currently owned by Hans Mobius. Two other properties, 605 and 607 Forest might also be part of the proposal. 605 Forest is owned by Pano Georgiadis, owner of Pano's Restaurant on Elmwood Avenue in Buffalo. 607 Forest is owned by Mobius.\n\"There's no new [court] date. The next appearance will be as needed,\" said Giacalone.\nThe proposal was withdrawn by Savarino on July 13, 2006 to undergo \"a do-over\" and according to the \"Buffalo News\", \"shed the lawsuits\" against the proposal; however, so far the proposal has \"not yet\" been resubmitted, but could be in about a \"week.\"\n\"With Council being out of session we have a bit of time [before resubmitting].

Better to have that decided (again?) in a public forum and through the approval process than through a debate over points of law in a courtroom,\" added Savarino.\nDespite the withdraw of the proposal, Giacalone states that the lawsuit his clients filed is still in effect due to the re-zoning of the properties, which he says are still in place and that he is \"frustrated\" that his client's \"day in court\" has been delayed continuously by Savarino and the city.\nSavarino believes that the re-zoning of the properties are \"not in effect\" because the proposal was withdrawn. He also stated that he is \"unsure\" on a decision to request the rezoning again because the \"city suggested\" the rezoning \"last time.\"\n\"We have pulled the request [proposal] so I would suppose it [the rezoning] is not in effect. We are as of yet unsure of whether or not to request rezoning of all the parcels. We are communicating with the City on this. You may recall that the City suggested this to us last time. We want to make sure we are doing the correct thing \u2013 and the proper thing. I am not sure whether I have a clear indication of that at this juncture,\" said Savarino.\nSavarino was asked if the proposal was going to be resubmitted or not, but did not answer the question.\nGiacalone states that there may be several resons as to why \"a new application has not been filed. Is Savarino having a hard time coming to an agreement with Mobius? Has Wyndham Hotels backed out? Is Savarino negotiating with Pano to buy the [605] Forest Avenue property?\"\nBuffalo's Common Council is scheduled to meet on September 9, 2006 after Summer recess."}

As highlighted in the prominent correction notice at the top of that article, several issues were present with the article.\nCiting a letter to the Herald, a member of the team involved in the search for the missing tapes, Bill Wood, described their article as \"great disservice to a group of Australian and US Apollo tracking station veterans involved in a new search for better Apollo 11 EVA images.\".\nMr. Wood pointed out that one of the tracking stations that these tapes had been recorded at was hosting a detailed description of the process Earth-side. Written by John Sarkissian of the CSIRO Parkes Observatory it gave a fascinating glimpse into what was done to show the world Neil Armstong stepping onto the Moon's surface.\nWhat Bill Wood, John Sarkissian, and their other former Apollo 11 colleagues are trying to track down are the recording of what was broadcast from the Moon, referred to as Slow-Scan TV (SSTV). This raw data was recorded onto 1\" wide magnetic tapes at the same time as it was converted for terrestrial TV broadcast. As far as the paper trail goes, there are about 700 boxes that might contain these coveted tapes. They are mixed in with recordings from the entire Apollo era, meaning there is a lot of footage that, with modern techiques, could offer far clearer pictures of man's first visits to another celestial body. While John Sarkissian's report points out that everyone thinks we have footage of the first moonwalk, modern techiques would, if the tapes are found before they deteriorate, allow these raw data tapes to be turned into far higher quality pictures than before seen by the public.\nOf course, proving that any publicity is good publicity, Mr. Wood didn't restrict himself to contacting Wikinews. Getting the right story out is important for these folks, and Leonard David, a Senior space writer with MSNBC helped give some impetus to the search with an article; help because the search is focussing not on the tapes, but on the people who might know where they, or the paperwork leading to them, might be. Time isn't working in favour of the volunteers searching for the SSTV tapes, part of the Goddard center is scheduled to close in October. Not the entire center as previously reported, but the Data Evaluation Laboratory. This is the one place where all the equipment and expertise exists to process these tapes, if they are found before they deteriorate."}

Nigeria agreed to cede the resource-rich area after a long drawn dispute with Cameroon. The ceremony comes after Nigeria completed the withdrawal of its troop stationed in the northern part of the peninsula. Many Bakassi residents are reported to be opposed to living under Cameroon's authority. \nLong-drawn dispute.\nThe resource-rich Bakassi peninsula was claimed by both Nigeria and Cameroon, leading to military clashes between the two back in 1981. \nIn 1994, Cameroon approached the International Court of Justice(ICJ) to rule on the claims, and the ICJ ruled in 2002 that the area belonged to Cameroon as per a 1913 treaty signed between then colonial powers Britain and Germany. Nigeria finally agreed to the handover in the UN brokered Greentree Agreement signed in New York on June 12th, which gave Nigeria 60 days to withdraw its military forces from the area. The agreement signed by Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo and Cameroon's President Paul Biya, was the outcome of the Cameroon-Nigeria Mixed Commission, set up by Secretary-General Kofi Annan to address the issue.\nHandover ceremony.\nThe ceremony was held in the capital of northern Bakassi, the fishing town of Archibong, and was witnessed by African Union, British, French, German UN and US officials, as well as the Nigeria's chief of defence staff, General Martin-Luther Agwai, and the heads of the army, navy, airforce and the police. The Nigerian flag was lowered Cameroon flag was then raised. The Nigerian Justice Minister Bayo Ojo and his Cameroonian counterpart, Maurice Kamto signed the documents Monday transferring authority at exactly 12:30 pm (1130GMT).\nSpeaking at the event, Mr. Ojo said \"We yield ground in order to give way to peace.\", adding, \"We have reason to celebrate the peaceful resolution of the Bakassi peninsula dispute\". He tried to reassure Nigerians living in the peninsula, saying the transfer \"does not not mean an end in itself. You still have the opportunity of living here if you choose to do so\".\nMr. Kamto told the gathering \"\"We have the conviction that things will not be different in Bakassi, whose inhabitants have always co-existed in peace as they do in other locations and regions of Cameroon.\" \nKieran Prendergast, representative of the UN secretary general at the event called the handover \"a good example of taking initiative in conflict prevention and solution\".\nLocal opposition.\nThe population of Bakassi, mainly Nigerian are reported to be deeply unhappy over the transfer. After Nigeria began its troop withdrawal last week, a group called the Bakassi Self Determination Movement declared Bakassi's independence from both Nigeria and Cameroon. The group hoisted blue and white flags and declared the creation of the \"Democratic Republic of Bakassi\". \nSpeaking to the IRIN news agency on Monday, the leader of the group, Tony Ene insisted on the \"natural right\" of Bakassi residents to \"determine our future,\", adding that \"If Nigeria does not want us, we choose to go it alone and not with Cameroon.\".\nSome residents have said that they will fight Cameroonian authority and called for help from militants in the Niger delta region. Complaints by Bakassi Nigerians of harassment by Cameroonian police years ago had led to the deployment of Nigerian troops in the region. Many residents have said that they wish to evacuate the area rather than live under Cameroon.\nCameroon welcomes transfer.\nThe Cameroon state broadcaster, Cameroon Radio and Television said \"Today is a beautiful day for Cameroon... (and) Nigeria,\" adding that the handover \"demonstrated the good faith of Cameroonian and Nigerian authorities to do everything to ensure that their two peoples can continue to live in peace and harmony in Bakassi,\". \nReuters also reports Cameroonians in Yaounde as welcoming the transfer.\nViolation of terms by Cameroon alleged.\nThe Nigerian Newspaper, \"The Daily Champion\" reports that several villages in the peninsula were \"taken over\" by Cameroonian security agents prior to today's formal handover, violating the terms of the handover agreement. The Lagos-based daily reported Brigadier General Felix Chukwuma, a spokesman for the Nigerian Army saying that higher authorities in Nigeria have been notified of this \"violation of the UN-brokered agreement on the demilitarisation of the peninsula\". \"I am very positive that Nigeria would take this up at the appropriate level,\" he said.\nTransition arrangement.\nNigeria has given Bakassi residents the option of either staying on in Bakassi under Cameroonian authority or getting resettled elsewhere in Nigeria. Under the handover agreement, Nigeria retains civilian authority over the southern section of the peninsula, known as West Atabong and Akwabana for two more years, during which the resettlement can proceed. Cameroon is to take full administrative control after a five year transitional period, during which neither country is expected to allow military presence in the region.\nThe UN Secretary-General's Special Representative for West Africa, Ahmedou Ould-Abdallah has said that about a dozen UN civilian observers will monitor the situation following the troop withdrawal to \"reassure\" the locals of their safety under Cameroonian authority. \nThe UN Office for West Africa has said in a statement that the next meeting of the Cameroon-Nigeria Mixed Commission will discuss how to delineate the maritime boundary between the two countries.\nResource-rich region.\nThe 700 sq km Bakassi peninsula lies in the gulf of Guinea, which is estimated to contain up to 10% of the world's oil and gas reserves as well as being a rich fishing ground. The peninsula is estimated to be home to between 150,000 and 300,000 people."}

Welcome to America and the real world of Virginia.\"\nThere is some uncertainty as to whether the comments were intended to be racist or not.\nThe term 'macaca,' if spelled as such, refers to a type of monkey, which could be termed very offensive, but Allen's campaign maintains that the word was used in reference to Sidarth's apparent mohawk.\nAdditionally, the Webb campaign was offended that Allen would presume that the color of their volunteer's skin implied he was an immigrant, as Sidarth was born and raised in Fairfax County. Conversely, Allen insists that the comment was not meant to imply immigrant status, and was simply an address to the Webb campaign at large.\nPolitical analysts fear that this mistake may jeopardize the senate race, as well as an Allen presidential bid."}

They include grants of up to $2,000 to switch to LPG, and $17.2 million over three years to improve E10 blend ethanol fuel infrastructure.\nSpeaking in Parliament House, the Prime Minister outlined the cause of higher petrol and diesel prices as a consequence of increasing global demand for oil occurring at a time when additional supply is tight. He singled out the re-emergence of China as a major factor in the increase in demand, and underinvestment as the main reason that supply cannot be increased rapidly.\nThe Prime Minister once again said he would not lower fuel excises, saying that any benefit that might bring would be quickly devoured by further rises in global oil prices, and would leave a large hole in the Federal budget.\nHe announced that the $1,000 grant to purchases of new vehicles equipped to run on LPG would be brought forward from 2011 to be effective immediately. In addition, he announced that conversions of private vehicles to LPG would be eligible for a $2,000 grant, also effective immediately. \nLPG is much cheaper than petrol in Australia, partly due to concessional tax treatment. The Prime Minister said that a six cylinder vehicle that travels 15,000 kilometres in a year would save $27 per week at current prices if converted from petrol to LPG. With the $2,000 grant, the conversion would pay for itself in four months.\nThe cost of the eight-year program to convert vehicles from petrol to LPG, including lost excise revenue, is estimated to be $1.3 billion.\nOn the ethanol front, the Prime Minister announced a further $17.2 million dollars over three years to help petrol retailers install or convert pumps for E10 blends. Eligible petrol stations will receive up to $10,000 towards the cost of conversion or installation, once complete, and an additional $10,000 when sales targets are met.\nThe Prime Minister also made mention of remote communities that rely on diesel for their electricity supply. He said that the existing Renewable Remote Power Generation Programme has helped remote communities reduce their reliance on diesel, through the use of renewable energy services like wind turbines. He announced that the Government will extend this programme with an additional $123.5 million over four years, and will now include energy efficiency projects.\nThe Prime Minister also committed an additional $135.4 million over the next five years for exploration services, searching for new oil, natural gas and geothermal reserves."}
