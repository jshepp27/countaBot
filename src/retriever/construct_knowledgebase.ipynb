Because then what you do is talk yourself into a guy, and then you set your organization back four to five years.”\\nThe Colts have a big offseason ahead, and Ballard has to show he can get the team on the right track. Of course, he has dealt with some tough hands but now is the time to show he truly is one of the best general managers in the league.\\nEven if the Colts weren’t a quarterback-needy team in the draft, Ballard said the front office and scouting department still evaluate the quarterbacks in the upcoming class.\\n“I learned this in Kansas City; we always go through the process of studying quarterbacks. One, because you never know when you’re going to be looking one in the face, so you just take him. Two, because you gotta play against them,” Ballard said. “So you want to be able to interview them, study them and at least know some history and background when they enter the league.”\\nIt is unlikely the Colts will be in the market to sign a veteran free agent or make a trade for one. It’s shaping up to be either sticking with Brissett or drafting a quarterback in April.\\nRegardless, the Colts aren’t going to force their way into picking a quarterback.\\nWith a few months to go, this will be the biggest topic surrounding the Colts leading up to the draft, but it isn’t at all clear what they plan to do when April finally arrives.', 'source_domain': 'coltswire.usatoday.com', 'title': \"Colts won't force QB selection in the draft\", 'title_page': None, 'title_rss': None, 'url': 'https://coltswire.usatoday.com/2020/01/03/nfl-draft-colts-quarterback-jacoby-brissett/'}\n"
