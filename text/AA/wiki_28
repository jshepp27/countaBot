The court found it guilty on Friday of supporting violence and being linked to the Kurdistan Workers Party, a Kurdish rebel group better known as the PKK.\nThe move has sparked violent protests across the country and caused the DTP to announce a boycott of parliament.\nThe party's two leaders, Ahmet T\u00fcrk and Aysel Tu\u011fluk, were banned from politics for five years and expelled from the Turkish parliament. On Saturday, T\u00fcrk announced that the remainder of DTP's parliament members would also pull out. They had held 21 seats out of a total of 550.\nThe verdict comes as the government is attempting to bring an end to 25 years of fighting with the Kurdish rebels, and follows weeks of intensified ethnic violence. \nThe judges of Turkey's constitutional court took only three days of deliberating over the evidence to unanimously rule that the DTP was guilty of inciting hatred and violence and was linked to the PKK. Ha\u015fim K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7, the head of the court, explained their decision.\n\"No party has the right to utilize discourse and activities that contain terror, violence and pressure. A party should separate activities and discourses that contain violence and terror from the peaceful ones\", he said.\nSpeaking shortly after the ruling, T\u00fcrk condemned the court's decision.\n\"This deepens the desperation\", he says. \"This is a reality. But we are hopeful that Turkey will find its peace one day. But by closing a political party you can't solve the problem. Turkey can only solve its problems through reason and dialog.\"\nK\u0131l\u0131\u00e7 acknowledged the ramifications of his decision:\n\"Some people will say this verdict will sabotage the peace process, but this case is two years old, and we are judges not politicians.\" He says no country in Europe would allow such a party to exist.\nIn justifying the ruling K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7 also said they had studied similar cases in the European Union \u2013 in particular the closure by Spanish courts of the pro-Basque Batasuna party. But the EU later issued a statement that \"while strongly denouncing violence and terrorism, the presidency recalls that the dissolution of political parties is an exceptional measure that should be used with utmost restraint.\"\nSuch concerns will likely affect Turkey's relations with the EU, which it is currently seeking to join. This is the 27th time a Turkish political party has been shut down since 1968.\nTurkish president Abdullah G\u00fcl expressed his approval of the decision. Speaking during his visit to Montenegro, he asked: \"What else can the court do when there are party administrators who declare the terrorist organization to be their reason of existence?\" \nThe PKK are listed as a terrorist organisation by Turkish authorities, the EU and the United States. They have been engaged in an armed struggle against the government since 1984. An estimated 40,000 people have been killed in the fighting.\nThe verdict comes after weeks of ethnic violence, in which Kurdish youths have been clashing with security forces across cities in Turkey's predominately Kurdish southeast. The demonstrations were in response to alleged mistreatment of Abdullah \u00d6calan, founder of the PKK, whilst in prison. A pro-Kurdish protester was shot dead in Diyarbak\u0131r last weekend, sparking further unrest. Turkish nationalists have also been demonstrating, following the killing of seven Turkish soldiers by the PKK in central Turkey on Monday.\nAlmost immediately following the verdict, violence erupted in the predominantly Kurdish south-east of the country between advocates of the party and Turkish riot police.

Two separate trials have been held for the three suspects. All three have been convicted and are in prison serving sentences of 30, 26 and 25 years. But all three continue to proclaim their innocence. \nThe most well-known of the three young people convicted of the murder of Meredith Kercher in November 2007 is American-born Amanda Knox.\nThe British tabloid newspapers immediately described Knox as a she-devil and man-eater. A week ago, 22-year-old Knox and her former Italian boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito were convicted to 26 and 25 years in prison respectively after a trial that lasted 11 months. The prosecution had requested life imprisonment. \nThe third suspect, Rudy Guede, from the Ivory Coast, had previously been convicted of 30 years in prison in a fast-track trial. Nick Pisa is a British tabloid journalist who has been covering the story since Kercher's dead body was found.\n\"In general I think people were expecting this verdict. It was certainly one that has been anticipated by both the Italian media and the Italian public,\" Pisa said. \"I think the only people who were surprised were perhaps the Anglo-Saxon press because in the face of the evidence that was presented in court it's very, very unlikely that this case would have been found guilty in another court.\"\nNo one argues that there is no evidence that puts Knox at the scene of the crime. But the prosecution has said there is plenty of circumstantial evidence that she was involved. He said Knox changed her version of the story many times and also unjustly accused a Congolese bar owner, for whom she had worked.\nKnox's mother, Edda Mellas, insists her daughter is innocent, that she was not home the night Kercher was killed and adds her daughter has been in prison for more than two years without reason.\n\"She's devastated, she's scared that she's going to be stuck in jail,\" Mellas said. \"She's confused... I don't think she even believed that courts find innocent people guilty of crimes they didn't commit and especially in this case where there was no evidence.\"\nMellas paints a very different picture of her daughter than the one presented by the prosecution and media.\n\"Amanda's a great young woman,\" Mellas said. \"She's very bright. She's athletic. She's kind. She has really, really good friends. She's just a normal college kid.\"\nKnox's family members say they will fight on and appeal the court's decision. They say the verdict, based on the evidence presented, was wrong. Nick Pisa agrees that the appeal could make the difference for Knox.\n\"It does appear that the evidence that convicted her was very, very flimsy and I think once they examine this DNA evidence again - let's remember there was the request for an independent review that was ruled out by the judge,\" Pisa said. \"And I think that's probably one of the first things that a new judge will ask for when he comes to review this case.\"\nBy early March the court will provide a written document outlining the reasons behind the verdict. An appeal by Knox's defense lawyers will be deposited soon after that. In the meantime Knox will have spent her third Christmas in an Italian jail as she awaits for a hearing date to be set, which is unlikely to be before October 2010."}

Though the new goals are harder, Anders Turesson, European Union representative at UNCCC, doubted in the ability of them to prevent 2-degree warming. In an interview in Copenhagen, he said, \"We are concerned about the environmental integrity of these texts and we do not see how they will deliver the 2-degree target. Hopefully we will be able to step up our ambitions as we move forward in the negotiations.\"\nBritish Energy and Climate Change Secretary Ed Miliband criticised the draft text for absence of a certain temperature raise threshold, said that the new texts \"are shorter texts than we\u2019ve had before, which we can negotiate around because the imperative here is to get on with it and get to an ambitious solution\".\nBloomberg news company interviewed several people from New York environmental group Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC). Its policy director David Doniger expects most difficulties to come at the end of the UNCCC, when Barack Obama and Wen Jiabao arrive at the summit: \"It\u2019s really come down to a set of difficult issues. It\u2019s a lot easier for lower-level negotiators to come to an impasse and go home. It\u2019s not easy for senior officials and definitely not easy for heads of government.\" As international climate policy director of NRDC Jake Schmidt commented similarly, \"It\u2019s going to be a tense negotiation over emissions cuts for developed countries.\""}

Dubai says more than $4 billion of the injection will be given to Dubai World's property firm, Nakheel, to repay its Islamic bond that matures Monday. The remaining funds will go towards additional expenses.\nNews of the last-minute bailout caused Asian stocks to rebound and pushed European shares up, which saw gains for a third straight session. Markets in the UAE also rose, with Dubai's index moving up by 10 percent and Abu Dhabi's jumping by seven percent. Despite the good news, Algebra Capital Managing Director Dino Kronfol says Dubai is not out of the woods yet. \"This is not something that is going to be resolved in a matter of weeks. It's going to take some time,\" Kronfol said. \"It's going to involve restructuring and we'll have to see how that transpires. But nonetheless, this is a positive development today.\"\nThe situation is completely different from just a few weeks ago, when Dubai World shook up global markets by asking for a standstill on its $26 billion debt. The government of Dubai made matters worse when it announced it would not guarantee the state-owned company's bills.\nDubai World's creditors still need to approve the standstill and effectively have until December 28 to make a decision. That is when the grace period of Nakheel's bond ends. The government of Dubai has issued a new law allowing the conglomerate to file for bankruptcy if its restructuring is not successful. But Kronfol says, if the process focuses on necessary aspects, it will succeed.\n\"If the restructuring actually deals with Dubai's contingent liabilities,\" Kronfol said, \"as a long-term solution, this actually really will help put the whole debt situation of Dubai behind us and really allow the markets to look more positively at 2010 and beyond.\"\nGovernment sources say Dubai World's restructuring process could include asset sales, but they would be limited to the Nakheel and Limitless companies and not include Istithmar World, which owns U.S. Luxury retailer Barneys."}

I thought it was my intestines, so I'm freaking out...but then it's a little boy.\" Richard realized that the product was a baby and not her insides when its leg twitched.\nRelatives of Richard's found her hysterically crying and pointing at the toilet. \"She was crying and saying, 'Help me, get my baby out of the toilet, he's drowning,\" Keith Richard, her cousin, told the \"Sun\". While the rest of the family was immobile by the revelation, police officers knocked on her front door; she was to be arrested due to outstanding warrants that Richard says have since been cleared.\nOne officer performed CPR on the baby and it was rushed to the hospital. The baby, since named Isaiah, weighed five pounds, nine ounces, and suffered a skull fracture, presumably as a result of his head hitting the toilet bowl.

For the first 12 years it was the plain old Terry Wogan Show and you were all Twits, the Terry Wogan is Tops Society. When I returned to the bosom of our family, it became Wake Up To Wogan and you all became TOGs, Terry's Old Geezers and Gals. It's always been a source of enormous pride to me that you have come together in my name, that you are proud to call yourself my listeners, that you think of me as a friend, someone that you are close enough to laugh with, to poke fun at and occasionally, when the world seemed just a little too cruel, to shed a tear with. And the years together with you have not only been a pleasure but a privilege. You have allowed me to share your lives with you.

We have been though at least a couple of generations together, for many of you \u2014 your children, like mine, now have children of their own.

And if anybody embodies the generous, warm spirit of this country it's you, my listeners. \n\"I am not going to pretend that this is not a sad day \u2014 you can probably hear it in my voice.

Nickels, dimes, and quarters were allowed but had negative value in the class total. The seniors won this contest, allowing them to have a no-uniform day on Dec. 11. Other activities such as bake sales and a beard-growing contest raised money as well.\nDuring an all-school assembly on Friday, the last day of the drive, Student Government President Kyle Marinko announced that preliminary calculations put the amount of donations at US$53,392.82, a record for the school.

The story broke on Thursday in the \"Wall Street Journal\" with a defense official, anonymously, informing them it is an old problem, which has already been fixed.\nThe \"Journal\" says U.S. military personnel in Iraq discovered the problem late last year when they seized a Shi'ite militant's laptop containing drone video feeds.\nSenior defense and intelligence officials say insurgents were able to take advantage of an unprotected communications link in the systems of the remotely-piloted aircraft. The insurgents used software that is available online and costs about $26.\nWhile U.S. defense officials say the issue has been fixed, the \"Journal\" quoted senior intelligence officials as saying it was not yet clear if the problem had been completely resolved.\nU.S. officials say there is no evidence that militants had been able to take control of the drones. But the intercepted video feeds could show where the planes are operating.\nThe \"Journal\" also reported that U.S. drone feeds have also been intercepted in Afghanistan.\nOfficials say the U.S. government has known about a flaw in the drone communication system since the NATO intervention in Bosnia in the 1990s. At the time, the military assumed local adversaries would not know how to exploit it.\nThe report says fighters in Iraq used software programs such as one called \"SkyGrabber\" from the Russian company SkySoftware, which is designed to intercept data transmitted by satellite Internet.\nThe \"Journal\" quoted one of the program's developers, Andrew Solonikov, as saying it was designed to download legal content \u2014 such as music and video \u2014 and that it was never intended to intercept military data.

The announcement came in the final hours of two weeks of tough negotiations, but fell far short of what some had hoped for. \nAgreement came late in the evening and after a day of intense negotiations.\nPresident Obama announced what he called a meaningful and unprecedented breakthrough. \"For the first time in history all major economies have come together to accept their responsibility to take action to confront the threat of climate change,\" he said.\nNegotiations stalled amid differences over mitigation efforts by cutting greenhouse gas emissions; verification; and funding.\nThat formed the core of discussions, said Mr. Obama. \"Throughout the day we worked with many countries to establish a new consensus around these three points, a consensus that will serve as a foundation for global action to confront the threat of climate change for years to come,\" he said.\nObama sat down with the leaders of developing countries at a multilateral meeting with Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao, Brazilian President Lula da Silva, Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, and South African President Jacob Zuma.\nThe agreement requires countries to list actions they will take to cut gas emissions by specific amounts and allows for verification.\nObama noted in his speech, \"And that's where we agreed to list our national actions and commitments, to provide information on the implementation of these actions through national communications, with international consultations and analysis under clearly defined guidelines.\" Obama also added that the leaders \"agreed to set a mitigation target to limit warming to no more than 2 degrees Celsius, and importantly, to take action to meet this objective consistent with science.\"\nLumumba Stanislaus Di-Aping, a Sudanese diplomat who acted on behalf of the Group of 77 of developing nations blasted the agreement and the 2 degree mark stating to reporters, \"The developed countries have decided that damage to developing countries is acceptable.\" On the 2-degree mark he stated the mark would \"result in massive devastation to Africa and small island states.\" Mr. Di-Aping and various representatives of the most most vulnerable countries wanted a target of 1.5 degrees.\nBritish Prime Minister Gordon Brown called it a good first step, but said a binding treaty must follow. German Chancellor Angela Merkel also called it a first step and urged more action. \nPresident Obama acknowledged that as well, saying this progress had not come easily, and alone is not enough. \"Going forward we're going to have to build on the momentum that we've established here in Copenhagen to ensure that international action to significantly reduce emissions is sustained and sufficient over time. We've come a long way but we have much further to go,\" he said.\nThe agreement is a far cry from what environmentalists and developing nations had called for. They wanted a legally binding treaty with much more specific commitments.\nSome environmental groups criticized the agreement. Kim Carstensen of the World Wildlife Fund spoke of a non-deal that is not fair and does not meet the demands of the developing world. \"It's been cooked up by a number of big countries in a closed room, without any transparency, without any civil society engagement in this building (the conference), without much engagement of the vulnerable countries,\" she said.\nClimate talks are to continue. Germany is to call a meeting on the issue in the coming months and a climate change summit is also expected to be held in Mexico within the coming year."}

What began as a low pressure system off the coast of Florida that resulted in widespread flash flooding is now on its way to the Northeast, where it is expected to dump over a foot of snow in many areas, such as in Washington, D.C., which was forecast to pick up as much as twenty inches of snow.\nDespite the traveling frenzy of the ongoing holiday season, the impending inclement weather has prompted various regional airlines to already announce that many of their flights to and from various East Coast destinations in the storm's path \u2014 such as in the New York metropolitan area, where over ten inches of snow are predicted to fall \u2014 will likely be grounded, or severely delayed at best.\n\"It's going to be very challenging for people who weren't able to get out today to rebook on flights this week,\" said spokeswoman Tara Hamilton of the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority.\nAs a result, blizzard watches and winter storm warnings have been issued all over the Northeast, from North Carolina to central and eastern New England. The National Weather Service warns that in some areas, \"falling and blowing snow with strong winds and poor visibilities are likely. This will in some areas lead to whiteout conditions[,] making travel extremely dangerous.\"\nSome areas even declared snow emergencies, and strongly encouraged people not to travel and to remain at home. In Virginia, the National Guard rescued several hundred motorists who became stranded due to the heavy snows. A twenty-mile traffic backup on Interstate 81 miles was also reported. According to Bob Spieldenner, a spokesman for the state's Department of Emergency Management, around a hundred people were moved to shelters.\n\"Some folks have decided to stay in vehicles, others have been taken to shelters. We're definitely trying to keep people off the roads,\" Spieldenner said. \nThe inclement weather also cut off power to many people in North Carolina, Virginia and West Virginia; the MSNBC news agency reported that a total of 136,000 businesses and homes were without power in those three states.\nIn more northern regions, unusual levels of uncertainty in the cyclone's eventual track are making it difficult for forecasters to determine the exact conditions over the next couple days.\nThe snow is expected to taper off by Sunday evening for most locations, but another storm is possible next week."}

She was 90.\nBorn Phyllis Lee Isley in Tulsa, Oklahoma on March 2, 1919, her pursuit of fame as an actress took her to New York City at the age of 19, leaving for Hollywood one year later. She changed her name to Jennifer Jones while testing for a part in a David O. Selznick movie; in 1949, Selznick, who produced \"Gone with the Wind\", would become her second and perhaps highest-profile husband.\nJones broke into dramatic film roles in 1943 as the lead in \"The Song of Bernadette\", a movie about a nun who saw visions of the Virgin Mary in Lourdes, France in 1858. She won an Academy Award for Best Actress for the role, and became a star well in-demand, earning Academy Award nominations the next three years in a row for the films \"Since You Went Away\", \"Love Letters\" and \"Duel in the Sun\".\nJones was a popular movie actress well into the 1950s. She starred as a Eurasian doctor, Han Suyin, in the 1955 film \"Love is a Many-Splendored Thing\", earning her a fifth and final Academy Award nomination. After a well-received turn in a film adaptation of Ernest Hemingway's \"A Farewell to Arms\" in 1957, she started to take on fewer and fewer movie roles. She would make her final on-camera appearance in the 1974 disaster movie \"The Towering Inferno\".\nJones was married three times and was survived by one of her three children, Robert Walker, Jr., from her first marriage to Robert Walker. She married for a third and final time in 1971 to industrialist Norton Simon, six years after the death of her second husband David O. Selznick. The couple's collection of South Asian art, acquired while living in India, is now showcased in the Norton Simon Museum in Pasadena, California. Jones was an active force behind the operations of the museum, serving as chairman from Simon's death in 1993 to 2003, and as trustee emeritus until her own death."}

The trial was held in the Old Bailey, a famous court in London.\nThe court heard how 46-year-old electrical engineer Paul Harvey was arguing with 48-year-old American wife Gloria Laguna on topics relating to the man's step-daughter's education and his former wife. At the time, both husband and wife had consumed alcohol and cocaine. When Paul threw the remote control, which weighed 160\u00a0grams, at Gloria, neither were aware of the fact that Gloria suffered from an extremely rare health condition which meant that an artery in her neck was weak. The remote control hit the area, causing Gloria to have a large brain haemorrhage. Paul attempted to give his wife the kiss of life, however he was unsuccessful and she later died from her injuries. Paul pleaded guilty to manslaughter in March of this year.\nJohnathan Goldberg QC, who was defending Paul Harvey, said: \"All he did was throw the remote control in her direction. By a fluke chance, maybe the same as, in a different context, winning the lottery, it landed on the exact spot where she had a weakness. He loved this woman very much. She was obviously a very fine woman who gave up her work for him. He is deeply ashamed and remorseful at the death of his wife at his hand.\"\nProsecuting was Richard Whittam QC. He said: \"It would only have required a trivial incident to cause her death.\"\nWhen sentencing Mr. Harvey, Judge Giles Forrester spoke to him. \"You killed your wife, who was rightly been described by your counsel as a fine woman,\" he said. \"You have this streak of anger and violence within your character that does surface from time to time.\""}

Heavy snow for parts of Northern England had also been forecast.\nIn South of England the wintry weather has also affected cross channel services, with Operation Stack being brought into effect due to issues at the Port of Calais. Eurostar and Channel tunnel services were also disrupted for an extended period, when trains broke down temporarily stranding at least 2000 passengers according to both BBC and Guardian reports.

Cassini has been trying to spot one since arriving in 2004, and in 2008 used infrared data to prove that there were liquid methane lakes down there. The northern hemisphere has only been visible since August 2009, as before then it was covered by winter weather. Most of Titan's lakes are in the north.\n\"This one image communicates so much about Titan \u2014 thick atmosphere, surface lakes and an otherworldliness. It\u2019s an unsettling combination of strangeness yet similarity to Earth,\" said Bob Pappalardo, a Cassini scientist with NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Titan's atmosphere is, like Earth's, mainly nitrogen, but temperatures on the icy world are around -180\u00b0C. This reduces the prospect of life, although the presence of liquid does increase the likelihood.\nThe lake seen in the photograph is called Kraken Mare, and at 150,000 square miles (400,000 square kilometers), it isn't the largest basin on north Titan, but it is bigger than the Earth's biggest lake, the Caspian Sea.\nRalf Jaumann, another Cassini scientist, spoke of the team's hopes for the future. \"Next, we want to find out more about Titan's liquid. Do we have some kind of weather there? Do we have changes with seasons? Does it rain? How does the liquid methane run across the surface?\"\nA team of scientists are due to propose to NASA that the agency drop a boat into a Titan lake, with Kraken Mare and the similarly sized Ligeia Mare being hot candidates. The Titan Mare Explorer (TiME) is projected to be relatively low-cost at US$400 million and would investigate the composition, density and shape of a Titan lake. If launched in 2016 it could arrive in 2023 and spend several years floating on the moon. However, several other projects are also keen to get themselves the next opportunity NASA is offering for the launch of a new project other than its own."}

Senate Democrats have reached a breakthrough in their struggle to pass sweeping heath care reform legislation, lining up the 60 votes needed to overcome fierce Republican opposition. Senators met Saturday in Washington, D.C. during a driving snowstorm in a frenzied effort to move forward on President Barack Obama's top domestic priority.\nThe spotlight was on moderate Democratic Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, who had been the last holdout as Senate Democrats raced against the clock and against determined Republican opposition to pass their health care bill by their self-imposed deadline of December 25th, Christmas.\nNelson said he is now ready to vote for cloture, which would advance the bill. \"Change is never easy, but change is what is necessary in America today and and that is why I intend to vote for cloture, I intend to vote for cloture and for health care reform,\" he said.\nNelson said he decided to support the bill after winning new concessions from Democratic Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid to limit the availability of abortions in insurance sold under the new legislation along with millions of dollars in Medicaid funding for Nebraska.\nThe legislation would extend health benefits to more than 30 million uninsured Americans and impose new regulations on the health insurance industry. \nSenator Reid of Nevada has been working for months to win over one holdout Democratic senator after another, repeatedly altering the bill to satisfy different demands. Reid says reform is essential. \"The broken system cannot continue and it will not continue. When President Obama signs this bill into law, we will officially end the era in which insurance companies win only when patients lose,\" he said.\nNelson's support should pave the way for Senate Democrats to win the first of a series of crucial procedural votes scheduled to begin at one o'clock in the morning on Monday and set to conclude \u2014 if everything goes smoothly for them \u2014 with final passage on Christmas Eve.\nRepublicans have been using a number of parliamentary procedures to delay action on the bill, including forcing a reading on the Senate floor Saturday of Reid's 338-pages of last minute amendments. Republican Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky responded to the apparent Democratic breakthrough. \"And Democrats are forcing a vote on it, as I indicated, over the weekend, counting on the fact that the American people are preoccupied with Christmas and not paying much attention to what they are doing,\" he said.\nRepublicans are unified in their opposition, saying the bill is too expensive and will not solve the problems with the current health care system. Senator McConnell dismissed claims by Democrats that the bill is historic. \"The history that is being made here, make no mistake about it, the history that is being made here, is the ignoring of the will of the American people,\" he said.\nSenator John McCain of Arizona echoed those comments in the weekly Republican radio address saying, \"Regrettably, there\u2019s nothing in this legislation that effectively addresses the problem of health care hyperinflation. In fact, experts tell us the Democrat legislation makes matters worse.\"\nDemocrats say they have been trying to reform the nation's health care system for close to 70 years, ever since President Franklin Delano Roosevelt was in office. Senator Christopher Dodd of Connecticut was emotional as victory seemed within reach. \"All we are trying to do is to guarantee that if you are a fellow citizen of ours, and you are struck with illness or a loved one is, that you will never again have that fear, that you will end up losing your home, your job, your retirement and your life savings because you have been afflicted with an illness through no fault of your own.\"\nIf the Senate is able to pass a bill next week, it would be viewed as a major victory for President Obama. But the bill would still need to be reconciled with a health-care reform bill passed last month by the House of Representatives before the president could sign it into law next year."}

The vehicle, which was carrying 48 passengers as well as the driver, were travelling back from a journey to the village of Mousehole to see Christmas lights. The accident occurred at 2215 GMT yesterday in the village of Townshend, not far from the town of Hayle. Road conditions at the time were icy, which may explain why the accident occurred. The first police car that arrived at the scene lost control on the icy road and crashed into the already overturned coach. The two officers in the car were uninjured, however the earlier crash had caused the deaths of two women. One of them died at the scene of the accident and the other was later killed as a result of the injuries suffered. 47 people were injured, five of them seriously.\nThe sequence of events that is believed to have happened, according to Devon and Cornwall Constabulary, is that the coach went off the road, collided with a tree, going through a hedge before finally overturning, causing the vehicle to end up on its side. 60-year-old Ann Ellis, who comes from the village of Illogan in Cornwall, was physically involved in the crash. Desribing her experience of this incident, she said: \"All I can remember is a big bang and we just went over. I got trapped under somebody else and there was someone on top of me. It was difficult to breathe but two gentlemen dragged me out. I was shaken, really shaken. I think we all were. It was horrific.\" \nDerek Smith, lives near where the accident occurred. He said that \"[w]e were just going to bed when we heard a knock on the kitchen door. She was covered in mud and had no shoes or socks on and was shaking as she stood there. I could hear this commotion going on. She said to ring the police and ambulance as their coach had turned over and there were 50 people in it and some of them were injured. My wife rang 999 and the lady was in a real panic. We gave her some socks and boots straightaway because she was freezing as she had nothing on her feet.\"\n75-year-old Charles Parker, who is living in St. Agnes in the county, was also injured in the accident, suffering injuries to his leg and his head. \"The roads were so icy,\" he explained. \"I heard a cracking noise and all of a sudden we had turned over. I remember later being helped out of the coach through a window. We were close to a house and they took most of the people in there. Then helicopters turned up. It was very frightening.\"\nInspector Matthew Shaw, who comes from Devon and Cornwall Constabulary, explained \"[i]t seems from initial investigations that the coach has slipped on ice.

However, \"The Times\" says the United States Bureau of Prisons does not have enough money to pay the state for the facility, which would cost about $150 million.\nThe report says the White House approached lawmakers on the United States House of Representatives Appropriations Committee several weeks ago about adding $200 million to the 2010 military spending bill for the project. Democratic leaders refused, defeating the request due to the project's controversial nature. \nThe administration wants to buy the prison as part of efforts to fulfill President Obama's order to close Guant\u00e1namo Bay. The president has acknowledged that the January 2010 deadline for closing the prison will not be met. The plan to close the prison and house the terror suspects in the U.S. has been met with fierce opposition by some members of Congress. Republicans say the closure of the prison and moving of inmates to American soil will make the country a greater target for terrorists. \nThe White House contends that the current prison at Guant\u00e1namo has become a terrorist recruiting symbol. It also pointed out that it would save taxpayers money as the Department of Defense currently pays $150 million to run the Guant\u00e1namo prison, while it will only cost $75 million to run the prison in Illinois.\nHowever, some moderate Democrats have also raised concerns, Representative Loretta Sanchez, Democrat from California cited security concerns saying \"[p]articularly making something on U.S. soil an attraction for Al Qaeda and terrorists to go after \u2014 inciting them to attack something on U.S. soil \u2014 that's a problem, and we need to think it through.\"\nSenator Jim Webb, a Democrat from Virginia recently stated that suspects of terrorism \"[d]o not belong in our country, they do not belong in our courts, and they do not belong in our prisons.\"\nGuant\u00e1namo, which now has some 200 inmates, has been harshly criticized by human rights advocates for the alleged abuse and mistreatment of detainees. \n\"The Times\" says the Obama administration will not have another opportunity to secure funding for the Thomson Correctional Center until Congress takes up a supplemental appropriations bill for the war in Afghanistan. The bill is expected to be finished in March or April. \nHowever, the newspaper says the administration is more focused on securing funding for the Illinois facility in appropriations bills for the 2011 fiscal year, which will not be debated until late 2010. Officials told the \"Times\" it could take eight to 10 months to install new fencing, towers, cameras and other security upgrades to the Thomson Correctional Center before any transfers take place.

Two fellow scientists contest whether Canadian George E. Smith and American Willard Boyle deserved the prize. It was awarded for the invention of the charge-coupled device, which is essential in modern digital photography. The main dispute was raised during an October interview by and , two now-retired colleagues from Bell labs. They claim that Smith and Boyle were not the main scientists behind CCD changing into image capturing technology.\nCharge-coupled devices move electrical charge around an array to a location where the charge can be manipulated (e.g. read out). Coupled with a device that converts light to digital signals, this enables digital imaging, which gave rise to modern-day digital photography. The Nobel citation indicates that digital imaging was the basis for the award.\nBoyle allegedly received credit for the invention because of his position as head of the laboratory, and Gordon claims that he actually had very little, if anything, to do with the CCD's use in imaging.\nGordon and Tompsett claim that the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences made a mistake by awarding the prize. Gordon said in an interview at his home in Mountainview, New Jersey, on Monday that \"they wouldn't know an imaging device if it stared them in the face\". They say that the patent used to justify the award does not mention imaging devices, and that they were the first to find such a use for what had previously been a project in memory and electrical storage. This development led to the invention of digital photography, as it meant that images \"could now be captured electronically instead of on film\".\nBoyle and Smith say that to them, it was obvious that CCDs could be used for imaging, however they handed that particular task to Tompsett. Gordon said of Tompsett: \"He invented how to do it. He designed the devices. He built them. He demonstrated on them,\" and suggests that the prize be awarded to him instead.\nGordon says that he has \"documentation that disproves most of what they [Smith and Boyle] are saying and the rest of what they are saying is not at all logical\". Tompsett says that Boyle and Smith deserved credit for the original concept, but that he should be credited for its use in imaging, which they had, he said, not even considered.\nBoyle and Smith have previously received a number of awards for inventing the CCD, dating as far back as the Stuart Ballantine Medal in 1973 from the Franklin Institute. Other awards came in 1974 and 1999 from the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers up to the Charles Stark Draper Prize in 2006.\nThe Nobel Prize in Physics has previously been awarded controversially, dating back to 1909 with a disagreement between awarding the prize for inventing the radio to and , and the exclusion of from the 1974 prize for the discovery of the , awarded to Antony Hewish."}

Insurance companies will no longer be able to deny you coverage on the basis of a preexisting condition. They will no longer be able to drop your coverage when you get sick. No longer will you have to pay unlimited amounts out of your own pocket for the treatments you need. And you'll be able to appeal unfair decisions by insurance companies to an independent party.\"\nHe also noted how historic the bill is, saying, \"If passed, this will be the most important piece of social policy since the in the 1930s, and the most important reform of our health care system since passed in the 1960s.\"\nObama noted the potential social impact, saying, \"It's the impact reform will have on Americans who no longer have to go without a checkup or prescriptions that they need because they can\u2019t afford them; on families who no longer have to worry that a single illness will send them into financial ruin; and on businesses that will no longer face exorbitant insurance rates that hamper their competitiveness.\"\nObama afterwards made phone calls to various Senators and other people, including Victoria Kennedy and David Turner of , Arkansas. Mr. Turner had his health insurance rescinded in January of last year, after his insurance company went back into his record and alleged that he failed to disclose his full medical record at the time he applied for coverage.

A group of U.S. and European diplomats were among those who stood outside the court after they were barred from the courtroom. \nGregory May, first secretary with the United States Embassy in Beijing, told reporters the United States is \"deeply concerned\" by Liu's sentence.\n\"We continue to call on the government of China to release him immediately,\" May said, \"and to respect the rights of all Chinese citizens to peacefully express their political views in favor of universally recognized fundamental freedoms, including the right to petition one's government.\" May says members of the U.S. embassy have repeatedly raised Liu's case at high levels in Washington, D.C. and Beijing.\nChina has accused foreign diplomats of \"meddling\" in the trial. On Thursday, Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Jiang Yu stressed that Liu is a Chinese citizen and, as a result, his case is an \"internal\" affair.\nLiu's charge of subversion is an ill-defined one, often brought against those who voice opposition to Communist Party rule. Liu has spent time in jail or under house arrest before, especially following his early activism over the 1989 student protests in Tiananmen Square. \nAlong with his prison term, Liu will lose his political rights for another two years. Liu's lawyer, Shang Baojun, said of the verdict, \u201cWe are just extremely disappointed.\u201d Baojun says Liu plans to appeal the verdict.\nLiu was detained more than a year ago after he co-authored the pro-democracy petition \"Charter '08.\" Thousands of Chinese citizens signed the online document, including 38-year-old Yang Licai, one of a handful of Chinese supporters who came to the courthouse on Friday. Yang says he came to turn himself in.\nYang also says he signed Charter '08, and since Liu Xiaobo was sentenced to 11 years for sponsoring the document, Yang felt he should receive the same treatment. After he finished speaking with reporters, police escorted Yang into a van that promptly drove away.\nMany international human rights organizations are denouncing the sentence and calling for Liu's release. International PEN, a non-profit organization devoted to freedom of expression, called Liu's sentence \"a grievous betrayal of his inalienable rights as a Chinese citizen.\" \nLiu is a former president of the independent China PEN Center. Larry Siems, the director of Freedom to Write and international programs at PEN American Center, says Liu exemplifies the traits that PEN values. \"He's been in his work an example of a true intellectual, someone who is true to his ideas and principles,\" Siems noted, \"and also as a public intellectual, someone who lives by his actions, his words, someone who's willing to speak his mind and take the consequences.\"\nSiems says PEN will continue to advocate for Liu's release."}

The man, who comes from a prominent Nigerian family, was read the charges in a hospital Saturday, where he is being treated for burns. \nThe charges were read by United States District Judge Paul Borman while Abdulmutallab was being held at the University of Michigan Medical Center in Ann Arbor, Michigan.\nAbdulmutallab was asked if he understood the charges against him, and he answered in English that he did. Witnesses reported he was in a wheelchair with a blanket over his lap. \nThe U.S. government accuses the Nigerian national of bringing an explosive device onto Friday's Northwest Airlines Flight 253 plane from Amsterdam in the Netherlands. A preliminary analysis by federal authorities indicates he used a syringe to detonate a highly explosive substance, identified as PETN. Abdulmutallab said he got the explosives in Yemen from an Al Qaeda bomb maker who sewed the device into his underwear.\nPassengers have told investigators the man went into the bathroom for 20 minutes before landing and complained about stomach problems before pulling a blanket on himself.\nJust as the plane was getting ready to land, they heard a pop, smelled smoke and then saw the man on fire. A Dutch passenger, Jasper Schuringa, jumped on the Nigerian to subdue him, and a fire extinguisher was used to put out the fire. \nThe House Committee on Homeland Security chairman, Bennie Thompson, said it was a very close call. \"We're just fortunate nothing happened. This was a serious situation,\" he said. Thompson said Congress will look into the matter soon. \"As soon as we reconvene from the holiday recess, we will start looking into the circumstances around the Northwest flight incident.\"\nNigeria's acting ambassador to the United States, Babagana Wakil, immediately issued a statement, which he read to the Voice of America over the phone. \"Expectedly, the embassy is already in contact with relevant U.S. authorities over the incident to facilitate any preliminary investigations to get to the bottom of this unfortunate development. Officers from the embassy have already flown to Michigan to gain consular access to the individual under investigation, and to offer the mission's cooperation to federal and local authorities,\" he said.\nThe suspect's family members in Nigeria said they were shocked. The suspect's father, an accountant and businessman, was previously a very well known banker in Africa's most populous nation. Friends and family said Adbulmutallab had studied in Togo and London, and that he had recently made several trips to Yemen. His father had, apparently, made concerns with his son's extremist connections known to the U.S. Embassy in Nigeria.\nAdbulmutallab told the FBI he met with a radical Yemeni cleric he corresponded with online. The cleric is not believed to be Anwar al-Awlaki, an American-born Imam connected to Major Nidal Malik Hasan who carried out the Fort Hood shooting last month.\nFriday, the White House said it believed it was an attempted act of terrorism. U.S. media reports say the suspect told interrogators he had affiliations with Al Qaeda.\nThe charges that were read against him Saturday carry a penalty of up to 20 years in prison.\nMeanwhile, security screening measures have upgraded in the wake of the foiled attack, including only allowing one carry-on bag for international passengers, banning anyone from moving around the airplane during the last hour of the flight and additional \"unpredictable\" measures that will vary from airport to airport.

The ministry says the Nigerian was granted a visa to study Arabic at an institute in the capital Sana'a. Security officials say they approved the visa for Abdulmutallab because he was granted visas by several friendly countries, and still held a valid visa to the United States.\nAbdulmutallab is charged with trying to detonate a bomb while flying aboard Northwest Airlines Flight 253 traveling from Amsterdam to Detroit. Authorities say he unsuccessfully tried to set off explosives attached to his body as the plane was approaching Detroit. \nA group known as al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula claimed responsibility on Monday for the failed attack. In an Internet statement, the group says the attack was in retaliation for U.S. support for operations against the group in Yemen. The claim could not be independently verified.\nYemen has recently begun operations with U.S. support against al-Qaeda due to concerns that the country is becoming a training ground for militants. al-Qirbi said to BBC's Radio 4, that al-Qeada remains a top priority despite the Yemeni government having to deal with two insurgencies, one in the north by Shi'a rebels and one in the south by separatists.\nal-Qirbi said the Yemeni government needs more support, \"We need more training. We have to expand our counter terrorism units and this means providing them with the necessary training, military equipment, ways of transportation - we are very short of helicopters. The United States can do a lot, Britain can do a lot, the European Union can do a lot in that regard.\"\nHe also believed there 200 to 300 members of al-Qaeda in Yemen, however, that is a rough estimate. He added, \"Of course there are a number in Yemen and they may actually plan for attacks as in Detroit.\" However, he called some statements made by U.S. officials overstated and \"exaggerated in some media.\" \nU.S. President Barack Obama says the United States will use all resources to find and hold accountable those responsible for the terrorist plot. \nThe president on Monday ordered a full review of air safety regulations and the terrorist watch-list system, in an effort to prevent future attacks. He vowed to use every element of U.S. power \"to disrupt, to dismantle and defeat\" extremists in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Yemen, Somalia or elsewhere, who might want to attack the United States.\nAbdulmutallab's name was listed in a U.S. government intelligence database, but he was not on the government's so-called \"no-fly list,\" which would have banned him from flying on a U.S. airline. \nHis father, a prominent banker and former Nigerian government minister, had warned the U.S. embassy in Nigeria about his son's extremist views."}

The vote margin was only three votes.\nOnly a matter of hours before the anticipated final vote, Wikileaks announced the disclosure of one of 23 documents suppressed by the Icelandic Minister of Finance: an apparent legal summary of meetings between Icelandic and EU representatives held in Brussels in November 2008. The leaked document discusses the then-assessed liabilities of Iceland at 60% of GDP, considerably higher than the reported 40% which repaying Icesave deposit holders entails.\nAmongst the other details in the report is emphasis of the deep-seated anger of the Icelandic people at the situation around the financial collapse, particularly the UK's use of anti-terrorism legislation in its approach to the country's banks. Iceland's interpretation of the situation, and its financial treaty obligations with the EU, considered foreign deposits lost through force majeure. All 27 EU members disagreed with Iceland's interpretation and Peter Mandelson, although he resigned from the Barroso Commission in October, presented the legal position that Iceland could not pass legislation that did not ensure treaty-mandated minimum balance returns from failed Icelandic banks.\nLeaked private communication from Ingibj\u00f6rg S\u00f3lr\u00fan G\u00edslad\u00f3ttir, Iceland's then-foreign minister, compared the potential liabilities the country faced with the reparations imposed on Germany by the Treaty of Versailles in the wake of World War I.\nThree banks failed in the financial crisis: Kaupthing, Glitnir, and Landsbanki. As the list of creditors emerged it was found that, among others, UK councils had around \u00a3900 million with the banks. Landsbanki agreed to repay the majority of funds held, giving council depositors priority status. Approximately \u00a3200 million on deposit with Glitnir is at-risk; the bank has stated the councils will be treated equally with all other creditors seeing them likely to only recover 30% of the amount Glitnir held.\nKaupthing faces other difficulties. The UK's Serious Fraud Office began an investigation earlier this month into the bank's UK activities. At issue are allegations savers were misled into selecting one particular account type, plus suspicious financial activity suggesting substantial amounts were moved out of the bank in the days prior to its collapse.\nAt present, UK councils have received little more than ten percent of their over \u00a3900 million deposits. They are among over 8,500 creditors claiming a staggering total of \u00a320 billion. The largest single claimant is the British Depositors' and Investors' Guarantee Fund seeking \u20ac5 billion, and, of some note, Formula One racing team Williams claiming around \u00a310 million in unpaid sponsorship from Glitnir who took on the liability from the Icelandic buyers of Hamleys. \nDebt to 84% government-owned Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) by Glitnir stands at around \u00a3500 million; much of the actual debt written off in 2008 as RBS posted \u00a324 billion losses. Further write-offs by the bank are expected to total less than \u00a350 million.\nIcelanders resented the discovery that fifteen senior ex-employees of Landsbanki claim \u20ac14 million between them, including a single claim of \u20ac2.7 million. Suspicion exists that the banks arranged substantial interest-free loans for various of their shareholders and executives.\nToday's announcement of the Icelandic government's agreement to pay out \u20ac3.8 billion keeps their application for EU membership on-track, although each one of the country's 320,000 citizens effectively faces a \u20ac12,000 debt."}

Tobacco oil can be very efficiently converted to biofuel, but most oil is located in the seeds, which the plant does not produce many of.\nTobacco seeds produce around 40% oil per dry weight but a crop of the plant yields only around 600kg of seeds per acre. The leaves have an oil content of around 1.7\u20134% oil per dry weight. The oil has previously been tested for powering diesel-fueled vehicles and can be more efficiently converted than the product of many other crop plants.\nThe team from BFL identified that oil production in the leaves was controlled by two genes: the diacyglycerol acytransferase (DGAT) and the LEAFY COTYLEDON 2 (LEC2) genes. By genetic engineering, they achieved oil yields of 5.8% oil per dry weight by modifying the DGAT while changes to the LEC2 resulted in a yield of 6.8% per dry weight.\n\"Tobacco is very attractive as a biofuel because the idea is to use plants that aren't used in food production,\" said cancer biology assistant professor at Thomas Jefferson Dr Vyacheslav Andrianov, Ph.D. \"In some instances, the modified plants produced 20-fold more oil in the leaves.\" \nVarious efforts are being made to find biofuel sources that are not also potential food, in order to steer clear of causing further rises in global food costs. Last month the US government anounced funding for research that used nonphotosynthesising micro-organisms to manufacture biodiesel, in the hope that this will prove more efficient than options that rely on photosynthesis. This also escapes one criticism of biofuels like tobacco; that competition for land to grow crops on will result in biofuel crops displacing foodstuffs and pushing food prices up. In November 2009 a Spanish team launched a study to determine if tobacco, as well as the prickly pear, was capable of withstanding the harsh conditions of land not suitable for growing food, selecting these plants for their ability to survive water shortages.\nExternal links.\n "}

Japan is the world's largest consumer of seafood per annum. With tuna being a major staple of their cuisine, the Japanese eat nearly eighty-percent of all commercially caught bluefin. \nHowever, tuna consumption in Japan has declined over recent years due to the change in the spending habits of its people as a result of economic downturns from the most recent recession.\n\"Consumers are shying away from eating tuna...We are very worried about the trend,\" a spokesperson for the Tsukiji market told the Associated Press. \nIn addition to the lack of demand and declining tuna stocks, fishermen and wholesalers worldwide are worried by the possibility of tighter fishing regulations that will be sanctioned and enforced by the Japanese government. Despite this promise, many environmentalists say that this is not going far enough; they say that the only way to curb the inevitable extinction of the Pacific bluefin tuna is to initiate a trade ban on the fish altogether."}

They (the UN) do not want to do that, and because of that, they have made this very ridiculous justification.\" Nevertheless, the UN has noted that even when harvests were good, Somali farmers are only able to supply 30-40% of the food needed to sustain the bulk of the country's population. \n\"[Somalia] has been described as the most complex emergency in the world, and perhaps the most dangerous to operate in. However, the world is not hearing this,\" say David Gilmour director of CARE International's Somali branch."}

The Crimson Tide defeated the Longhorns 37-21.\nAfter a strong start by Texas, Alabama -- led by Greg McElroy -- went on the offense, leading by 24-6 at the end of the first half. Texas launched an impressive comeback bid to bring the score within three, but Alabama capitalized on two turnovers at the end of the fourth quarter to put the game away.\nFor the Crimson Tide, Ingram led all rushers with 116 yard and both he and Richardson had two touchdowns. For Texas Jordan Shipley led all receivers with 112 yards and two touchdowns. McElroy went 6/11 passing with 58 yards gained but was sacked several times.

On fourth down in their first possession, Alabama attempted a fake punt, but Texas' Blake Giddeon intercepted the ball. A goal-line stop by Alabama forced a Texas field goal. However, the major news in Texas' first possession was an injury to Texas starting quarterback Colt McCoy, who left then game and later underwent X-rays on his right shoulder. McCoy was replaced by true freshman Garrett Gilbert. On the ensuing kickoff, Alabama again turns over the ball and Texas gets another field goal. In addition, Texas' defense came up strong, with three sacks in the first quarter.\nAlabama answered back on their next possession with a Mark Ingram touchdown to take the lead at the start of the second quarter. Alabama then forced a Texas three-and-out and received the ball on their own 47 yard line. The drive stalled after a sack of Alabama quarterback Greg McElroy and a Crimson Tide punt was taken by the Longhorn's Jordan Shipley at the Texas 15 yard line. Texas had no luck passing and had to punt, which Alabama returned to the Texas 51 yard line. On the second play from scrimmage, freshman Trent Richardson ran for a 49 yard touchdown, and after the extra point, a 14-6 Alabama lead.\nTexas hit back quickly with a 35-yard run to Alabama's 30 yard line and Gilbert went to the end zone with a pass, but the ball was dropped. Alabama got their first turnover of the game on a Gilbert interception on the next play, but could not capitalize, only managing to pin Texas within their five-yard-line on a punt. After two short runs, Gilbert could not hit Shipley for a first down pass, leaving Texas to punt. Alabama returned the punt to the Texas 29 yard line. Alabama kicker Leigh Tiffen hit a 26 yard field goal with 29 seconds left. However, the Tide were not done yet, as Marcell Dareus intercepted a Gilbert shovel pass and returned it 28 yards for the score and a 24-6 halftime lead.\nAt halftime, Texas coach Mack Brown told ESPN that he had chosen to go for a long field goal try to end the half and that the shovel pass was a routine one. Alabama coach Nick Saban told ESPN news that his team would not underestimate Texas in the second half, saying both teams needed to play 60 minutes of football. At the beginning of the second half, Brown told ESPN's Lisa Salters that McCoy would not return in the game.\nTexas received the ball first in the second half. After a first down, a Texas penalty forced a third-and-long, but Marquise Goodwin managed a 39-yard run for another first down. Texas could not advance the ball and punted into the end zone for a touchback. Texas' defence then forced a punt and received the ball at their own 34 yard line, before punting to Alabama who got the ball on their own 19 yard line. Texas then forced another punt, which Texas returned at the 47 yard line before punting again for an Alabama touchback. After a sack on McElroy, Alabama punted and Texas received on their 40 yard line. Texas finally broke the defensive battle when Gilbert hit Shipley for a 44 yard touchdown pass. After the extra point, Texas recovered on onside kick. Texas could not not get a first down, but managed to pin Alabama at their own 6 yard line as time wound down in the third quarter.\nAs the fourth quarter, the Crimson Tide marched down the field, helped by two personal fouls committed by Texas defenders. Kicker Leigh Tiffin then missed a 52 yard field goal, turning over the ball to Texas on downs. Gilbert hit several first downs and were helped by an Alabama penalty and Gilbert hit Shipley for another touchdown and a two-point conversion bringing Texas to within three points. On Alabama's ensuing possession, they are forced to punt and Texas gets the ball at the seven yard line.\nTexas' comeback bid was stopped when Gilbert was sacked and fumbled the ball, which Courtney Upshaw recovered for Alabama. Mark Ingram then scored on third down and Tiffin score the extra point. On the ensuing possession, Javier Arenas intercepted a Gilbert pass, which Alabama capitalized on with a one-yard Trent Richardson touchdown run. Tiffin's extra point attempt hit the upright to bring the score to 37-21. Texas could not respond as Gilbert was again intercepted. Alabama knelt the ball to end the game."}

He was on business in Hiroshima at the time of the first bombing on August sixth.

Three days later, having gone back to work in Nagasaki, he was approximately three kilometers away from the site of the second bomb. Although he was exposed to significant radiation in this instance as well, Mr. Yamaguchi was left relatively unscathed.\nFollowing Japan's surrender and the end of the War days later, Mr. Yamaguchi worked as a translator for the occupying American forces and later as a local schoolmaster, before eventually returning to Mitsubishi\u2014which had since then become an automobile manufacturer. \nIn his later years, Mr. Yamaguchi became a respected lecturer who gave talks about his experiences, and publicly spoke out against the stockpiling of nuclear weapons. \nFor instance, in 2006, he addressed the United Nations General Assembly. \"Having been granted this miracle, it is my responsibility to pass on the truth to the people of the world,\" Mr. Yamaguchi said to the Assembly. He went on to say, \"My double radiation exposure is now an official government record. It can tell the younger generation the horrifying history of the atomic bombings even after I die.\"\nWhen asked by the British Broadcasting Corporation what his reaction was to Mr. Yamaguchi's death, the mayor of Nagasaki said that \"a precious storyteller has been lost.\"\nAmong the family and friends Mr. Yamaguchi left behind were his three adult children\u2014who have also had health issues in their lifetimes thus far that they think may have be related to their father's initial exposure.

The bacteria found was a form of fecal contamination, it was discovered, although it was not immediately clear whether it came from the soda fountains themselves, or people with dirty hands.\nOther bacteria were also found in the soda samples, including E.coli, present in eleven percent of the tested beverages. Many of the soda drinks apparently fell below the US Environmental Protection Agency's minimum standards for drinking water; regulations state that samples cannot test positive for E.coli bacteria. In total, 20% of soda fountains had more than the maximum recommended levels of bacteria.\n\"The large number of beverages and soda fountain machines containing E. coli is still of considerable concern [...] and suggests that more pathogenic strains of bacteria could persist and thrive in soda fountain machines if introduced,\" the authors of the study wrote.\nRenee Godard, the study's lead author, and a professor of biology and environmental studies at Hollins University, commented on the findings. \"Certainly we come in contact with bacteria all the time. It's simply that some bacteria may potentially cause some disease or gastrointestinal distress. One thing we hesitate with is that people get afraid of bacteria. Many of them are benign or helpful, but certainly, I don't want E.coli in my beverage,\" she said.\nGodard and her team took samples of 90 different beverages from three groups - sugar soda, diet soda, water - from 30 fast-food restaurants in Roanoke, Virginia.\n\"You can get collections of bacteria in the water line and that then runs through the whole machine and gets in to the beverage. Any time any water or liquid sits somewhere, it's just a breeding ground for bacteria,\" commented Primary Care Physician Alanna Levine.\nExperts suggest that plastic nozzles used on soda fountains might be part of the reason why the study found so much bacteria is present; it takes only a single dirty hand to spread bacteria over a tube, and it could be easily transferred to the rest of the fountain from there. \n\"It could be from dispensing with a hand that wasn't clean or using wet rags to wipe down the machine. We haven't done the work to really identify those potential sources and how these bacteria get established,\" Godard said.\nA professor at the University of California Davis, however, said he believed that a single localised study wasn't enough to come to a conclusion about soda machines throughout the country. \"How sanitation regulations are promulgated and enforced in a community are different. Some communities are more on to it than others. How much of a threat it represents? It's probably limited. Once again, it's a matter of what regulations are in place, who pays attention and whether it's being followed,\" he said, as quoted by CNN.\nThe National Restaurant Association responded to the university's findings in an e-mail statement. \"While the results of this study are disconcerting, we feel that it isn't representative of our industry and that our guests can safely enjoy beverages from dispensers and single-serve containers alike,\" the organisation said.\nThe American Beverage Association also countered the findings. \"Fountain beverages are safe. Consumers can rest assured that our industry's fountain beverages pose no public health risk. [...] Importantly, our industry meets, and often exceeds, all government health standards in bringing its products to market.\""}

He emotionally writes how, \"After the accident, she told me, 'Joey, God sends no cross that you cannot bear...'\" \nBiden also states that his mother taught him to have dignity, self-respect, and principle. On the subject he remembers how, in his youth, \"When[ever] I got knocked down by guys bigger than me, and this is the God's truth, she sent me back out [on] the street and told me, 'Bloody their nose so you can walk down the street the next day.' And that's what I did.'\"\nBiden said in a separate statement to the media, \"Together with my father, her husband of sixty-one years who passed away in 2002, we learned the dignity of hard work, and that you are defined by your sense of honor. Her strength, which was immeasurable, will live on in all of us.\"\nHe continued, \"She was the center of our family, and taught all of her children that family is to be treasured, loyalty is paramount, and faith will guide you through the tough times. She believed in us, and because of that, we believed in ourselves.\"\nJean Biden is survived by the Vice President, two other sons, her daughter, grandchildren, and five great-grandchildren."}

However, unlike the majority of the other stations on both digital and FM, Amazing Radio doesn't play normal, mainstream music. Instead, its playlist consists solely of music from unsigned bands and artists who have signed up and uploaded their music to AmazingTunes.com. Their music can then be downloaded from the site, for which they get paid. The more downloads and interest an artist receives, the more likely they are to get played on the national radio station. Amazing markets itself as an \"ethical\" download website, on which artists get 70% of the download revenues. They now have more than 22,000 songs uploaded, with about 100 uploaded every day. \nPaul Campbell himself has extensive experience in both radio and television production, having worked for BBC Radio 4 and Channel 4. After success with his own production company in the nineties and with support from investors, Campbell launched Amazing Tunes in 2005.\nAs Amazing Radio introduces a new schedule for the New Year, with presenters rather than solely pre-recorded links, Wikinews reporter interviewed Campbell to find out more.\nInterview.\nHi Paul, thanks for doing this interview.\nMy pleasure \u2013 thanks very much for asking me. We\u2019re really grateful that Wikinews is interested in us.\nAt the end of 2009, you complained to the BBC Trust about BBC Introducing. Can you explain what this was about and the reasons for it. Has anything come of it?\nSure: in a nutshell, the complaint was about unfair competition - about the BBC not following its own rules. It\u2019s still ongoing. It will take, ahem, a while to resolve. \nThe details are a bit complex, but here goes. (If you commit suicide out of the boredom at what follows, I apologise). \nAs British readers will know, the BBC has a guaranteed and very comfortable income derived from the Licence Fee - effectively a tax you have to pay if you want a TV. According to Wikipedia (so it must be true), this generates an income to the BBC of about stg4.5bn per annum. Nice. \nNot really. In recent years the beeb has increasingly used this gargantuan income - and its incredible audience reach online, on radio &amp; TV - to launch new services that make life impossible for everyone who is not the BBC. These have ranged from e-learning content (that completely wrecked the market for private publishers), to a new digital radio station (that caused a private speech station to go bust), to an attempt to launch online regional news services (which caused howls of outrage from local newspapers). The BBC does it for the best of reasons \u2013 to provide a public service \u2013 but BBC people live in an insulated, publicly-funded world, one where you know with complete certainty you\u2019ll get paid on the 15th of every month. It\u2019s a million miles away from the real world, where entrepreneurial people take risks, and lose their jobs and their houses if it goes wrong. Here, the BBC\u2019s actions have grave implications. And not just for private companies: the UK as a whole is very good at creative industries, which are the fastest-growing part of the economy. But it\u2019s kinda hard to grow a global business if your domestic market has been wrecked by a rampaging, publicly-funded, bull in a china shop. So by accidentally knackering private companies, the BBC is also damaging the British economy. \nWise people noticed this. A few years ago the Governance of the BBC was changed. A new regulator, the BBC Trust, was created. It tried to address the problem. It insists the Corporation does a 'public value test' when it wants to launch a new service, or to expand an existing one.\nHere, it hasn't. Although the BBC has a longstanding commitment to play new music on its local radio stations, and one of its most famous DJs John Peel had an outstanding show on BBC Radio 1 for many years which played new music (and was, incidentally, produced by one of our new presenters), it's suddenly changed the game. It\u2019s launched a huge expansion and automation of this formerly piecemeal and limited activity, targeted exclusively at unsigned bands. BBC Introducing is a pan-BBC brand, combining local and network radio, television, online, even a special stage at Glastonbury. There's a very expensive online upload service which I just know would have cost ten times what we had to spend on our similar service. There's a Head of Department, doubtless with dozens of staff. I\u2019ll bet they have BBC Introducing pens. It's everywhere. \nThis is, by any reckoning, a \u2018new service\u2019. But it\u2019s not been subjected to a public value test. Worse, I have it on very good authority from someone inside the BBC that BBC Worldwide - its commercial arm - is planning to launch a BBC Introducing record label \u2013 i.e., an overtly commercial expansion of BBC Introducing. This would be like the BBC trying to create a new version of the music industry, all by itself. \nWhether or not you think it's a good thing for the beeb to champion new music, you may agree it should follow its own rules. It hasn\u2019t. There was no Public Value Test; no request to the Trust to be allowed to do this. \nSo we complained. It was a bit hilarious. The Trust said they weren't allowed to investigate until we'd complained to the beeb itself and the BBC had rejected our complaint. There was a long pause as I tried to understand the logic. I said \u2018I\u2019m guessing the BBC didn\u2019t do a PVT because it didn\u2019t think it needed to do a PVT. We think they should have done. We\u2019re asking you to investigate, to see if you agree\u2019. They said \u2018you have to complain to them first. It\u2019s protocol\u2019. It's all very British - i.e., charmingly polite \u2026 ludicrously bureaucratic \u2026 and totally useless. \nSo we have another hoop to jump through. We're now preparing our formal complaint to the BBC itself - whose Director General is someone I used to work with, when we were both fresh-faced BBC trainees in 1981. It takes time: I\u2019ll have to write it myself, and I have a business to run. The beeb will have a small army of staff whose only job is to read it \u2026 and reject it. (They always reject criticism; it's the BBC's default position. They usually do it with a slightly pained expression, hurt that anyone could fail to understand their brilliance and omniscience. Either that, or they try to demolish your intellect and cast doubt on your probity. Either way, they'll reject it). \nWhen they do, we'll then be able to go back to the BBC Trust to say \u2018guess what? The BBC rejected our complaint. Now will you investigate?\u2019. Yawn. \nAll this might make me seem a BBC-hater. Actually nothing could be further from the truth. The BBC trained me. I was once, so I was told by the Head of Appointments, its youngest-ever Producer. Despite appearances, I firmly believe it's one of the best things about the UK. I wrote to The Times of London recently in defence of it. But unfortunately it's really, really bad at understanding the damage it does to private companies, the ones like ours that create jobs and try to create wealth, without the benefit of a guaranteed income. (Or even, any income at all). \nThe stakes are high. The conventional music industry is falling to bits around us. There\u2019s an historic opportunity to re-invent music in a way that's fair to musicians and music-lovers, and also creates jobs and wealth in the real economy. It's vitally important the BBC, with its publicly-funded hobnailed boots, doesn't ruin that opportunity. \nSo we\u2019ll do our complaint, wait for it to be rejected, complain to the Trust, and keep battering away. Fun fun fun. (This would never happen in the States). \nYou don't accept any PRS registered artists at all. Why not? \nWe\u2019d love to \u2013 after all, we have the same aim as PRS, which is to make it easier for musicians to earn a living from their talent. But we can\u2019t. There\u2019s two reasons. \nI wrote to the CEO of PRS when we first launched Amazing Radio pointing out these absurdities and asking if we could do a more intelligent deal. I said that I thought we had identical aims \u2013 to make life fair for musicians. I suggested we could/should be a feeder to them, introducing new members to PRS as they grew in the music industry. But so far, the PRS head is still firmly in the sand.\nAnd how would you suggest PRS could improve? If they did, would you consider allowing artists registered with them? \nPRS could improve by; \nIf they did that, we\u2019d sign up. This would not necessarily be popular with our audience. A lot of people \u2013 especially charities and small businesses \u2013 like the fact that they can listen to Amazing Radio without a PRS licence. But we\u2019d do it anyway, as it would be a better service for musicians. \nMy personal view is that the PRS should also stop threatening to murder law-abiding people who want to listen to music at work. There was a recent case where they threatened someone for singing at work. They actually did that. They later apologized, but it revealed the corporate mentality. I think it\u2019s incredibly counter-productive; it means their members make less money, not more; it\u2019s ruining perceptions of what motivates musicians; it\u2019s causing thousands of people to stop listening to music. When really, PRS should be encouraging that, shouldn\u2019t it? \nWith regard to Amazing Tunes, how many downloads could your most popular artist expect to receive per month and monetary wise, how would this compare to them receiving that number from iTunes?\nSorry, but we don\u2019t currently release detailed figures \u2013 our competitors would love it, but we\u2019d rather be nice to our artists and our investors instead. We do say that we expect amazingtunes.com artists to make \u2018anything from a few quid, to a good living, to a small fortune\u2019. At the moment, because it\u2019s still very early days, people are clustered towards the first two of those options. As things grow \u2013 and there\u2019s been incredible growth even in the past few months \u2013 we hope/expect more and more artists will start to make tens of thousands of pounds each month. We\u2019ll soon register for the official chart, and our guess is that someone will have a major hit before long. Then everything will go really crazy. \nSo far as the iTunes comparisons go, the facts are already public domain. An artist on iTunes can expect to make 8p from a 79p download. The same artist on amazingtunes.com will make about 52p. We only deduct the VAT and the cost of the transaction: 70% of what\u2019s left goes to the artist. What\u2019s more, their income will improve over time - the more downloads we sell, the less the transactions cost us, so the more cash there is to give to the artists. That\u2019s one reason we ask people to buy eight or more songs in one transaction \u2013 it\u2019s much more cost-effective, less of their cash goes to VISA, more to the artist. (See my Blog post on this here - ). \nAmazing Radio launched in mid-2009. How has it grown since then and what are your current listening figures?\nIt\u2019s gone mad since then. I\u2019ve worked in broadcasting and the media since 1978 (I was very very young then, mind you). I\u2019ve never known anything like it. The reaction has been absolutely incredible \u2013 and it\u2019s growing faster than ever right now. The most humbling thing has been the audience feedback \u2013 masses of long emails from people we\u2019ve never met, saying they found it by accident, and they love it.\nWe\u2019ve not yet paid for RAJAR audience figures because \u2013 well, because we\u2019re a bit mean really, and I\u2019m not convinced they would accurately measure our audience. I think RAJAR is very good at coming out with figures for radio stations that have been going for 40 years, but not very accurate when it comes to new and innovative stations which are also listened to a lot online and especially popular with young people. But the best guess I\u2019ve heard in the industry is that we have something like 600,000 listeners in the UK on DAB. That\u2019s an estimate, but it came from a very wise source. We have slightly more than that number on top as regular users online, and a weekly reach for amazingtunes.com of about two million users. But it\u2019s all growing so fast, those numbers will be out of date by the time you read this. \nDAB transmission costs are well over half a million pounds a year. How is this being funded currently and how are you planning to fund it in the future?\nWe\u2019re not contractually allowed to tell you what we pay, so we can\u2019t confirm or deny the cost. Whatever the true figure, it is undeniably expensive; but it gives our musicians a chance to be on national radio. We figure it\u2019s worth it. I\u2019m reminded of that wonderful teachers\u2019 union bumper sticker: \u2018if you think education\u2019s expensive, try ignorance\u2019. If you think creating the world\u2019s first radio station playing 100% new music is expensive \u2026. try being inaudible. \nSo far, we\u2019ve been funded by a very small number of private investors, people of enormous wisdom and insight, natch. They understand that we have a very serious, long-term and audacious ambition to change the music industry for the better, to make radio interesting again, and to turn the word \u2018amazing\u2019 into a global challenger brand. \nThis year, we expect to do one final fund-raising in the UK, then to raise a lot of money on the West Coast of the USA to make this absolutely massive and global, fast. They understand this scale of ambition there. \nWhat are your plans for Amazing Radio in 2010? Any exciting announcements to come?\n\u2018Fraid so. \nIn 2010, we hope to make Amazing Radio the default station for everyone who has ever had that incredible experience of hearing a song for the first time, and having to stop what you\u2019re doing to listen to it: a station for everyone who has broad musical tastes, a respect for musical talent and an open mind. We want it to be constantly surprising, fresh, original, sometimes hilarious, always unexpected. \nBlimey, I sound like some corporate twat. \nNow (obviously) it wouldn\u2019t be massively unexpected if we suddenly started revealing all the unexpected things in advance \u2013 but basically, we\u2019d like the message to spread that we\u2019re doing something different, fresh, original and ethical - so we\u2019ll launch more new programmes and more new services \u2013 on Amazing Radio and amazingtunes.com. Things like our virtual radio station Amazing Ambient. . There\u2019ll be some video and some TV along soon too. And other cool stuff. \nIt may not be \u2018insanely cool\u2019; just cool will do just fine. \nWe also want to do it in other places. E.g. America. We\u2019ve already started there.

After multiple attempts to fix the problem failed, the pilot decided that an emergency landing was the only remaining choice.\nOnly the plane's nose gear and left landing gear had descended. The right landing gear would not release. The airliner made a go-around as the crew attempted to fix the problem. Passenger Jim Falk knew something was wrong saying, \"Normally a big plane like that doesn't do a bypass, so we knew something was wrong.\" \nHowever, the pilot decided that nothing could be done to bring the gear down, and an emergency landing was declared. \"We are going to have an unusual landing,\" the pilot calmly announced to the 53 passengers seated on the plane, according to passenger Moritz Loew. Another passenger, Paul Lasiuk said he was more shocked than scared, telling himself, \"You have no choice. You're going to go through this.\"\n\"Brace! Brace! Brace!\", the pilot announced over the plane's public address system, calling for passengers to enter the brace position as the plane made a touchdown on the runway at Newark. The plane touched down on the nose wheel and left rear wheel before lurching to the right causing sparks to fly as the right engine skidded along the runway. Eventually, the plane came to stop at 9:27 A.M. EDT.\nAfterward, passengers and crew evacuated the plane by sliding down the evacuation slides and moving quickly away from the plane. They were then taken by bus to the airline's lounge where they told their stories to investigators and waited for their luggage. Three passengers reported minor injuries but refused treatment.\nThe emergency landing caused the airport to shut down for 20 minutes, but service quickly resumed on two of the airports three runways. The plane remained on the runway throughout the afternoon as investigators determined the cause of the landing gear failure. \nThis is in contrast to last week, when the airport was shutdown for six hours after a young man named Haisong Jiang breached security by passing through an exit to kiss his girlfriend goodbye.\nAccording to passengers, the crew remained calm during the ordeal. Jim Falk said, \"They did a great job. There was no yelling, screaming, panicking or anything.\" Falk said he wanted to buy a bottle of champagne for the currently unnamed pilot. Falk added, \"The pilot did a beautiful job. He didn\u2019t put it in the water like the other pilot did, but he should be commended.\" \nMartin Trebino, a spokesperson for United Airlines said they would not release the pilot's name on Sunday, but did not indicate when his name would be made available either.\nPaul Lasiuk said, \"I've had a lot of worse landings at Newark before. It was unbelievably smooth.\"\nMoritz Loew joked with himself afterward saying, \"What's a great landing? One that you walk away from.\"\nThe flight, which left Chicago's O'Hare International Airport early Sunday morning around 6 A.M. reported no other problems during the flight up until the incident. According to United Airlines spokesperson Robin Urbanski, it remains unclear why the landing gear failed to deploy. Urbanski added that passengers' tickets would be refunded and that they would receive vouchers and credit towards any future flight."}

McGwire admitted to the use of drugs in the late 1980s and during most of the 1990s. There had been wide speculation about McGwire's use of performance-enhancing drugs, as he came from an era of baseball that has been dubbed the \"steroid era\" because of the high use of performance enhancing drugs throughout Major League Baseball.\n\"I wish I had never touched steroids. It was foolish and it was a mistake. I truly apologize. Looking back, I wish I had never played during the steroid era...I shouldn't have done it and for that I'm truly sorry...It's time for me to talk about the past and to confirm what people have suspected,\" said some of the statement released by the St. Louis Cardinals today. McGwire had recently been hired as the Cardinal's hitting coach and was set to begin the job this season.\nMcGwire, 46, had been regarded as one of the most powerful hitters of his time. Over his career, McGwire hit 583 home runs, which is currently tied with Alex Rodriguez, who has also admitted to steroid use. McGwire is now one of the six players in the top 15 home run hitters of all time that has either confessed to or been linked to the use of performance-enhancing drugs.\nMcGwire's best season came in 1998, when he set the record for most home runs in a single season. After a race throughout the final months of the season with Sammy Sosa, he ended with 70 home runs, easily beating Roger Maris's previous record of 61 (This record was later broken by Barry Bonds, who now holds the current record of 73).\n\"I'm sure people will wonder if I could have hit all those home runs had I never taken steroids. I had good years when I didn't take any and I had bad years when I didn't take any. I had good years when I took steroids and I had bad years when I took steroids,\" said McGwire to the Associated Press. According to McGwire, the steroids were used for the enhancement of his play as well as to recover from the several injuries that he suffered between the 1990 and 1994 seasons.\nIn the statement, he also commended the MLB Player's Association for attempting to remove steroids from the game. \"Baseball is really different now\u2014 it's been cleaned up. The commissioner and the Player's Association implemented testing and they cracked down, and I'm glad they did,\" McGwire stated.\" Since he used the steroids before the current rules were in place, McGwire will likely not be disciplined by the league or the MLBPA.\nIn 2005, McGwire was called to the U.S. Congress and refused to answer questions about his steroid use, saying that he did \"...not want to talk about the past.\" It is unknown if the MLB will investigate into this matter.\nMark McGwire is currently tied for eighth on the all-time home runs list. he played 16 Major League seasons and retired following the 2001 season. He is currently the hitting coach for the St. Louis Cardinals."}

Johnson said that the group had tried to escape the ban by changing its name, and said that the move was needed in order to \"tackle terrorism.\"\nBut Islam4UK leader Anjem Choudary said that the ban, made under the Terrorism Act 2000, is unfair because the group is not involved in violent activity. \"We are an ideological and political movement. We do not engage in any military activities or any violence,\" he said to VOA News.\nIslam4UK was originally founded in the 1980s under the name al-Muhajiroun.

According to the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, no tsunami warning was issued, contradicting some media reports that said there was one in place. The quake's magnitude was revised down from an initial report of 7.3 on the Richter scale.\n\"A destructive widespread tsunami threat does not exist based on historical earthquake and tsunami data,\" the US Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said. \"However, there is the possibility of a local tsunami that could affect coasts located usually no more than a 100 km [60 miles] from the earthquake epicentre.\"\nThe USGS reports that the epicentre was fifteen kilometres (ten miles) southwest of Port-au-Prince and southeast of Miami, Florida, at a depth of ten kilometres.\nAccording to USGS analyst Dale Grant, this tremor was \"the largest quake recorded in this area\"; the last strong quake was in 1984, and had a magnitude of 6.7, he noted.\n\"Everybody is just totally, totally freaked out and shaken. The sky is just gray with dust,\" said Henry Bahn, an official with the US Department of Agriculture who was visiting in Haiti and a witness to the incident. \"I just held on and bounced across the wall. I just hear a tremendous amount of noise and shouting and screaming in the distance,\" he commented, as quoted by the Associated Press.\nAccording to data from the USGS, there were thirteen aftershocks after the initial tremors, the strongest of which was 5.9 on the Richter scale; seven others measured in at 5.0 or higher \u2013 all the aftershocks were 4.0 or greater.\nNo deaths have yet been reported, but a hospital in Port-au-Prince was damaged, and a US government official said several houses fell into a ravine. An analyst for USGS in Colorado commented that there could be many deaths from an earthquake of this strength. \"I think we are going to see substantial damage and casualties,\" he said.\nThe USGS's Mike Blanpied remarked that about three million people were impacted by the earthquake, given its location. \"This quake occurred under land as opposed to off-shore, so a lot of people were directly exposed to the shaking coming off that earthquake fault, which was quite shallow,\" he said.\nA lack of communications makes it difficult to ascertain what damage was done. US embassy personnel were \"literally in the dark\" due to power failures, said State Department spokesman P. J. Crowley. \"They reported structures down. They reported a lot of walls down. They did see a number of bodies in the street and on the sidewalk that had been hit by debris. So clearly, there's going to be serious loss of life in this,\" he said, as quoted by AP. A reporter for Reuters said he had seen \"dozens of dead and injured people\" amidst collapsed buildings.\n\"We are trying to get in touch with our people on the ground but we are experiencing communication problems, which is not unusual in a disaster such as this,\" said United Nations spokeswoman Stephanie Bunker to Agence France-Presse.\nAid appeals and international reaction.\nAppeals for aid flooded in following the disaster. In a phone call to CNN, the Haitian ambassador to the US, Raymond Joseph, said: \"I'm calling on all friends of Haiti and people who are listening to me to please come to our aid. Today as Haiti is going through the worst day in its history I am calling for all others who got help from us in the beginning to help in support. The only thing I can do now is pray and hope for the best.\"\nUS Secretary of State Hillary Clinton promised that her country would also provide assistance to Haitians. \"The United States is offering our full assistance to Haiti and to others in the region. We will be providing both civilian and military disaster relief and humanitarian assistance and our prayers are with the people who have suffered, their families and their loved ones.\"\nPresident Barack Obama also said that the country would be \"ready to assist\" Haiti."}

The deemed powers contained in the Terrorism Act 2000 denied the human right of privacy.\nUnder the European Convention of Human Rights people in the UK are granted the right to privacy, although their government felt that the threat of terrorism meant that the breach of this was justifiable and allowable under exemptions in the Convention. Previously, the powers have been unsuccessfully challenged before the English and Welsh High Court, upheld by those nations' Court of Appeals and finally upheld again before the UK's House of Lords.\nSection 44 of the Terrorism Act allows the Home Secretary to designate an area for use of the powers for a certain period. If this period was more than a month then at the end of the month then the Home Secretary can renew them. The entirety of Greater London has spent several years with the powers in effect. Under the Act, the police do not need to have any reason to search whoever they like and have the power to confiscate articles they believe to be of use to terrorists. They can also make arrests if these are found.\nYesterday's ruling was made in a case brought by Kevin Gillan and Pennie Quinton, both stopped outside a military exhibition in London's Docklands area. Gillan was stopped while cycling past and kept there for twenty minutes while journalist Quinton was ordered to stop filming even after showing her press card. She claims to have been detained for roughly thirty minutes at the scene, while police claim she was there for five minutes. The court awarded \u20ac33,850 (\u00a330,400) to cover the costs incurred by bringing the case.\nUK Home Secretary Alan Johnson expressed disappointment at the ruling and stated that an appeal will be launched. Chief Constable Craig Mackey of the Association of Chief Police Officers said that while this appeal was pending Section 44 of the Act would continue to be used by police.\nThe court found that the humiliation and embarrassment of searching people in public was a clear breach of privacy as well as criticising that the way power was authorised did not require a test that its use be \"necessary,\" merely \"expedient.\" The court singled out London's designation under the Act as an area where the powers could be used continuously since it became law as an example of why this was not appropriate.\nFurther criticism in the ruling was aimed at the idea that the decision to search could be \"based exclusively on the 'hunch' or 'professional intuition' of the police officer\". The judgement added that \"the absence of any obligation on the part of the officer to show a reasonable suspicion made it almost impossible to prove that the power had been improperly exercised,\" with no judicial oversight. Racism was a further concern, with the court expressing a fear that the powers could easily be used in a discrimminatory manner. Four times as many blacks and Asians have been searched compared to whites."}

To this end, Google states that they are \"currently in the process of notifying these companies,\" and they are cooperating with the \"relevant authorities.\"\nDrummond goes on to say that through a separate and unrelated investigation, Google has additionally discovered that the accounts of \"dozens\" of Gmail users worldwide who are \"advocates\" of political and human rights in China \"appear to have been routinely accessed by third parties\" as well.\nHowever, he affirms that \"...these accounts have not been accessed through any security breach at Google, but most likely via phishing scams or malware placed on the users\u2019 computers.\"\nAs a result of what has occurred here, Google said it has already made significant changes to the security infrastructure of its users' accounts as to prevent something like this from ever happening again.\nAt the same time, Google advised individual users to use more discretion while online, \"We would advise people to deploy reputable anti-virus and anti-spyware programs on their computers, to install patches for their operating systems and to update their web browsers. Always be cautious when clicking on links appearing in instant messages and emails, or when asked to share personal information like passwords.\"\nGoogle launched its Chinese-language search engine, Google.cn, in January 2006. The only precondition to operating in China was that the company had to acquiesce to certain censorship demands from the one-party government. When defending their controversial rationale for operating in the socialist republic, Google said \"\u2026that the benefits of increased access to information for people in China, and a more open Internet outweighed our discomfort in agreeing to censor some results.\" \nNevertheless, Google has still been widely criticized for this voluntary censorship of search results of topics, such as the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, movements for Tibetan and Taiwan independence, and the Falun Gong religious movement along with other information considered harmful to the Chinese government. Some feel it goes against and is hypocritical of Google's informal motto, \"Don't be evil\".\nIn response, a spokesperson for the Chinese Consulate in New York City, Wenqi Gao, said in a phone interview to \"The New York Times\", \u201cI want to reaffirm that China is committed to protecting the legitimate rights and interests of foreign companies in our country.\u201d\nIn contrast, Sharon Hom, the executive director of Human Rights in China said, \"It's a wakeup call for the international community about the risks of doing business in China. The tendency has been for companies to keep their eye just on the benefits of doing business. But the risks are real\u2014The risks are to our intellectual property. The risks are to our values.\"\nAnalysts noted that this move has the potential to financially hurt Google, which has a somewhat limited share of the Internet search market in China, which is dominated by the Chinese-based Google-like website Baidu. Google's shares fell just under two percent after hours to US$579.50. Meanwhile, Baidu shares rose five percent to US$406.\nHarvard Business School professor David Yoffie said, \"The consequences of not playing the China market could be very big for any company, but particularly for an Internet company that makes its money from advertising.\"\n\"It will hurt their profits. They get eight to ten percent of their revenues from China,\" said Trip Chowdhry, an analyst for Global Equities Research. \"If they walk, they will eventually be invited back into China, because the Chinese people will request that. Openness always wins, but it will take some time.\"\nTim Ghriskey, the chief investment officer for Solaris Asset Management said, \"Clearly not good news for Google and clearly not good news for consumers. You've got to think that eventually Google figures out a way to deal with this. If they do have to shut down their Chinese operations, that they would be able to reinstate them. Hopefully soon. I can't imagine that this would be permanent.\" He added, \"China is a great growth engine for every business. It is a great opportunity for Google as well.\"\nIn response to all that has happened and what has been said, Drummond explains that this has \"led us to conclude that we should review the feasibility of our business operations in China.\"\nHe goes on to state, \"We have decided we are no longer willing to continue censoring our results on Google.cn, and so over the next few weeks we will be discussing with the Chinese government the basis on which we could operate an unfiltered search engine within the law, if at all. We recognize that this may well mean having to shut down Google.cn, and potentially our offices in China.\"\nDrummond concludes his statement by trying to assuage the situation the best he can, \"The decision to review our business operations in China has been incredibly hard, and we know that it will have potentially far-reaching consequences\u2026We are committed to working responsibly to resolve the very difficult issues raised.\""}

The quake was centered about sixteen kilometers from the capital, and struck at a depth of just ten kilometers, exacerbating the damage. At least 27 aftershocks were also recorded, the strongest of which came in at 5.5 and 5.9 magnitude. A tsunami alert was initially issued following the tremor, but it was retracted shortly afterwards.\nBuildings across the capital have collapsed, including the presidential palace and the headquarters of the United Nations peacekeeping mission in Haiti. However, the president, , and his wife reportedly survived the collapse of the building. The country's envoy to the United States believed damage costs could reach billions of dollars.\nUN peacekeeping chief Alain Le Roy said many people were in the UN building when it went down and they remain unaccounted for.

We do not know about their fate [...] some people have been extracted out of the building - but only less than 10 for the time being. Some dead, some alive.

Spokeswoman Elisabeth Byrs, however, said she had no further details about that.\nEfstathios Daras, the Greek ambassador to Venezuela who also represents Greece in Haiti, described the situation. \"We fear major loss of life, maybe in the thousands or tens of thousands. Survivors are using their hands to help get trapped people out. There are fears of big aftershocks which could make the situation even worse. There is huge damage to the infrastructure. We can't get through anymore.

It's total chaos.\"\nRachmani Domersant, an employee for Food for the Poor charity described the conditions on Port-au-Prince's streets. \"The whole city is in darkness, you have thousands of people sitting in the streets, with nowhere to go. I've seen seven to eight buildings, from office buildings to hotels and shopping stores, collapsed [...] I think hundreds of casualties would be a serious understatement.\"\nPresident Rene Preval told the Miami Herald today that the aftermath of the disaster was \"unimaginable\". \"Parliament has collapsed. The tax office has collapsed. Schools have collapsed.

The Director of the WFP office in Geneva, Charles Vincent, remarked that the first priority is to save lives. \"To rescue people that are buried, that are trapped, etc. [...] followed very rapidly by a big problem of water, sanitation, epidemic-problems of diseases that might be bred in that kind of situation,\" he noted.\nThe Haitian ambassador to the United States, Raymond Joseph, told the nation is seeking US assistance, and called the quake a catastrophe of major proportions. \"I'm quite sure we're going to face a disaster of major proportion,\" he said.\nSeparately, the said it will immediately approve a $200,000 grant for emergency assistance to Haiti.

The UN will do whatever possible to help the Haitian people to overcome these difficulties,\" Ban stated.\nBan noted that 3,000 UN peacekeepers were in Haiti, and that they secured the seaport and airport. They are trying to rescue people buried underneath rubble, he said, but were severely hampered by lack of heavy equipment. \"Brazilian forces have been working through the night to rescue but because of the darkness and destruction of infrastructure not much progress has been made. We hope it will be better this morning,\" Ban said.\nThe aid group added that its emergency response team for is based in Haiti and is well prepared, with a public health, water and sanitation team in Port-au-Prince. Oxfam says it is preparing to send in emergency supplies as soon as possible from Panama.\nThe American Red Cross pledged US$500,000 to help the country, and would send out people to assess damage. \"As with most earthquakes, we expect to see immediate needs for food, water, temporary shelter, medical services and emotional support,\" it said yesterday evening in a statement.\nA number of other nations, including the UK and Venezuela, are also planning to send aid.\nA reporter for the news agency, however, said there might be difficulties delivering aid. \"We are about 300km from the epicentre of the earthquake, and we know that the UN agencies and the humanitarian groups here are trying to get together some kind of strategy to get aid over to Haiti. We know that there are trucks loaded with supplies ready to go but the difficulty is that no-one really knows how to get that aid to the people [effectively].\"\nThis quake is said to have been the strongest in Haiti in over two hundred years; the last time an earthquake of comparable magnitude was recorded was in 1770.\nHaiti is the Western Hemisphere's poorest country.

Many joined Scientology in the early 1970s, and after leaving in 1996 she later testified against the organization. Published in October, Many's book has gone on to become one of the top selling new books on Scientology at Amazon.com.\nBackground.\nScientology was founded by writer L. Ron Hubbard in 1952. At the time Many joined in the early 1970s, she was a college student attending Salem State College in Massachusetts. She agreed to become a member of the elite Scientology group known as the \"Sea Org\" in 1972 \u2013 the title of her book refers to a document she signed when joining that group. \nShe moved to Scientology's base of operations in Clearwater, Florida, and rose to a high-ranking position within the organization. Many describes how she recruited others into the organization, and sold Scientology products to celebrities. She participated in intelligence operations as a spy working for a secret unit within Scientology, and she writes that she covertly became part of the mental-health-care community in Boston, Massachusetts.\nMany recounts how Scientology executives decided to remove her from her leadership position within the organization. As laid out in the book, she was instructed to reside in a parking garage, remove herself from family, and perform hard labor. Her account highlights she was ordered to perform these tasks by Scientology officials whilst five-months pregnant. These experiences led her to later have a mental breakdown and eventually leave Scientology.\n\"My Billion Year Contract\" was first published in October. Since then it has risen to the second spot among recent best selling books about Scientology on the website Amazon.com \u2013 the number one spot is held by Marc Headley's book, \"Blown for Good\". \n\"Catholic Online\" associate editor and former Archbishop of the Charismatic Episcopal Church, Randy Sly, compared \"My Billion Year Contract\" to other insider accounts by former Scientologists, including Headley's and that of Monica Pignotti. \"Their books and essays, along with many others, have publicly called into question a number of Scientology beliefs, claims and practices over many years,\" wrote Sly.\nIn an article this month about the book for \"The Boston Phoenix\", Chris Faraone wrote, \"even if just some of her trials really happened [...] her new memoir might \"still\" be the most shocking nonfiction work featured at this week's American Library Association (ALA) Midwinter Meeting in Boston.\" Faraone commented, \"\"My Billion Year Contract\" is a horror story.\"\nInterview.\n Can you describe a little bit about yourself and your background, and how you came to be interested in Scientology?\nNancy Many: I was a college student, just starting out in the early 70\u2019s. It was a time of turmoil, Civil Rights, Women\u2019s Rights, The deaths of JFK, MLK and Bobby Kennedy were still close to our time period. Viet Nam was polarizing the nation and dividing families. Woodstock had happened a few years before. The culture held no real anchors \u2013 it seemed everyone was experimenting. The progam to become a counselor at my college was losing it\u2019s funding, I had just broken up with a long term boyfriend, and every one I knew was either into drugs or Alcohol. Never big on alcohol I was growing tired of the drugs.\n When you first started getting involved in Scientology, what attracted you to it?\nNM: That they were going to make the world a better place, that they did not do drugs and lived a communal lifestyle.\n What positive aspects did you gain from your experiences in Scientology? What benefits does Scientology have to offer people who take its courses?\nNM: I gained more self confidence, I gained an ability to work in sales. In the first course I gained the ability to quiet my mind and to just exist in the universe. I think these same benefits are there today for new people, but do I think they are worth the Price Charged, or Years of one\u2019s life given --- No I do not. Last I checked to do all of Scientology, and make it to the top of the bridge \u2013 Operating Thetan 8, it would cost approximately $250,000. In the old days you could sign a contract for up to a Billion Years and get those services at no cost, but to my knowledge that is not the type of counseling staff are getting now. And if you did leave before your particular contract was over, you will receive what is called a \u201cFreeLoader Bill\u201d, a total of all the services that you received in exchange for your working for them. The current and past food and pay situation for staff members is below the illegal workers in this country.\n If you desired something that Scientology offered - and felt you gain positively from some of your experiences while inside the organization - have you sought out and found such values elsewhere, for example, spirituality or another form of a religious belief system?\nNM: After I left Scientology I did make a list of all the courses, things I learned, personal abilities I had and what I liked from it. Over the years I have been able to find much of what I liked in other philosophies written years ago by different authors. L. Ron Hubbard originally acknowledged all those learned men in the beginning of the book Science of Survival, but over the years that list has dwindled, until now it seems that L. Ron Hubbard invented all this material. What I will give him credit for is that he put it in simple, modern day English, so it was easier to grasp, but of my list of things I have found useful, I was able to find them elsewhere, and for a much less expensive price.\n You speak in the book about the psychology term cognitive dissonance, which you describe as \"the feeling of uncomfortable tension, which comes from holding two conflicting thoughts at the same time. This can cause an individual to fight within their minds to somehow make it make sense.\" (p. 54) Do you still experience cognitive dissonance when reflecting on your experiences in Scientology? Why and how so?\nNM: I no longer experience Cognitive Dissonance when reflecting on my experiences in Scientology. I have done further study of it and find it to be a common human ailment.\n\"Cognitive Dissonance is a state of tension that occurs whenever a person holds two cognitions (ideas, attitudes, beliefs, opinions) that are psychologically inconsistent such as 'Smoking is a dumb thing because it could kill me' and 'I smoke two packs a day.' Dissonance produces mental discomfort, ranging from minor pangs to deep anguish; people don\u2019t rest easy until they find a way to reduce it.\" (\"Mistakes Were Made, But Not By Me\", Carol Travis.)\nI experienced several levels of Cognitive Dissonance while in Scientology. They say Church on the door, but the day to day operations are not those of a church \u2013 those contrary thoughts were assuaged for years because of the Hubbard Policy \u2013 Religion 1970, wherein he stated something like we are a religion for accountant and attorneys, nothing about our daily operations will change. That plus the line that I was often given and gave to others new to the Church \u2013it\u2019s not a faith, it is an Applied Religious Philosophy, non-denominational in nature, you can still belong to your own church and be a Scientology.\nThat held my discomfort together until years later I read the Messianic Program, wherein Hubbard laid out the steps to make himself the next Messiah for planet earth.\nAnother cognitive dissonance was why are we attempting to destroy and take over the entire field of mental health, if we are a church, well the same answer, we aren\u2019t really a church.\nWhen LRH [L. Ron Hubbard] himself wrote to me that he wished he had never gone the \"Church\" route at all, it made me happy and erased the tension of the Cognitive Dissonance.\nWhy were the prices so high? If we were supposed to Clear the Planet, and help make the world a better place, then why did we charge so much? Very few people could afford that level of money and still survive and raise a family.\n In the book you write, \"I have studied the research done on the power that groups can hold over individuals and the mindsets and peer pressures that got me to that place.\" (p. 92.) What types of resources did you use for this study? Can you recommend any references for others wishing to learn about this topic?\nNM: \"Opening Skinners Box: Great Psychological Experiments of the Twentieth Century\" by Lauren Slater\n\"The Lucifer Effect: How Good People Turn Evil\" by Phil Zimbardo\n\"Mistakes Were Made (But Not by Me)\" by Carol Tavris\n It is understandable that the act of writing down your experiences on paper could be a cathartic process but - why publicize it as a book?\nNM: As I write in my Preface the book was written almost two years ago, but the fear of publishing books on the subject of Scientology, got it no where in the area of publishing, Scientology is too frightening and scares even large publishing houses. I even got turned away by a \"Print on Demand\" \u2013 where I pay for it myself. They were just to frightened of repercussions on them as a company and on the staff as individuals.\nBut one night, an old friend who had been in Scientology for 36 years and had reached the highest most level in Scientology (Operating Thetan Level 8) arrived at my door suicidal. I knew I had to do more. For the past 10 years I had been dealing with Mentally Troubled individuals one on one, but this woman brought to my door the fact that what I was doing wasn\u2019t even cracking the egg of mental abuse. So I took my book off the shelf and my husband and I started our own publishing company.\n Did you fear publicizing your experiences could subject you and your family to the Scientology practice of \"Fair Game\" ?\nNM: Of course. In my particular case they had already interrogated me to the point of psychotic meltdown, and there wasn't much more they could do to me. I hear the clicks on my phone, I\u2019ve gotten the private investigator with the CIA past placed on my car. I\u2019ve had people show up. But as long as I am truthful and don't make things worse than they were, nor better than they were, this is America, land of Free Speech. While working to get the book out (in those two months) I came to learn of 3 more deaths of people who experienced mental breakdowns while under the care of Scientologist, it only spurred me on.\n Have you experienced anything from Scientology after publicizing your story that you feel is retribution or a form of Fair Game?\nNM: I'm never certain if it is coincidence or not, but yes little things, not like the others that are coming out now and testifying at court cases. I also think Scientology is a little busy with just being declared a Fraud by the Government of France, Belgium has been preparing their law suit and should be coming out shortly. Here in America, the current head of Scientology and the corporation have just been served with a lawsuit on human trafficking. An eight year old boy was signed up with the Sea Org (Billion Year Contract) and he was put to work scrubbing pots and pans from that young age. I know of under aged children who signed Billion Year Contracts, they were promised their High School educations, which they never got, but those children were 13 or 14 \u2013 this is an 8 year old boy. Senator Xenophon in Australia has just stood up and asked for a government inquiry to the human abuses of Scientology. His documentation includes part of my book. Yes there are many things they can do to me, but I am tired of them Mentally and otherwise abusing people to the point of suicide. \nI think they are spread a little too thin and there is nothing in my book that was not posted on the internet, either under my pseudonym \u201cKathryn\u201d, or in internet posts.\nIn addition I was on the stand in court for one of the Lisa McPherson hearings on her death, and they had free opportunity to question me on these matters. \n Towards the end of your book you describe how you still kept in touch with a son who was still actively taking Scientology courses - and that you had friends still working in the organization. Have you experienced the Scientology practice of \"Disconnection\"? Have any of these people been instructed by Scientology to cease communication with you?\nNM: My son is his own person, and I am proud he makes his own decisions. We don\u2019t discuss it other than the discussion I described in the book. \nYes I have had people Disconnect from me, and it is sad. I used to be a member of this group, so I also disconnected from others. It is so freeing to now be able to decide who is a friend and who is not \u2013 on my own with no other influences.\n During the recounting in the book of your mental breakdown, you cite your husband and family as key factors in helping and supporting you. What else, or who else - what other factors have helped you recover from your mental break after disengaging from Scientology?\nNM: The other factors that helped were that I did have a lot of friends who were not and had never been Scientologists, so I could hang with them and the subject would never come up. Thereby not \"triggering\" me back to Scientology language or way of life.\nI also have/had a deep faith in God and an internal strength that made me pull my way out of the intermittent hell that lasted for years. I knew this was life or death. There were simply people or places I could not be around.\n\"' Recently another book by a former member of Scientology's Sea Org was published, \"Blown for Good\" by Marc Headley. Have you read other books on Scientology? What other books about the organization (other than those produced by it) stand out for you as important in understanding its impact and the internal workings of the movement?\nNM: I love Marc Headly's book and feel very strongly that our books are so different that they (together) give a vivid and 3 dimensional view of the world of Scientology.\nI have read all other books about Scientology that were not in a good light. The one that stands out for me as the best of all time is Helen O'Brien's Book entitled \"Dianetics In Limbo\". She was an early Dianeticist and joined during the first wave of Dianetics in the early 50's. Some things have never changed and that is why that early book is such an important read.\n You worked for Scientology's intelligence division the \"Guardian's Office\" (GO) and then later for the current incarnation of its intelligence department, the \"Office of Special Affairs\" (OSA). (pp. 154-155, 289.) From your experiences working for GO and OSA, does the workings of the management of operatives by these groups differ? How so?\nNM: The largest difference in the management of operatives is who those operative are. In the GO days many were Scientologists and Private investigators rarely used. Now it is the opposite, the Church has attorneys \u2013 with whom they have privilege, and it is the Attorney's who hire the Private Investigators. Now if a PI gets caught during an operation, it can only go back as far as the Attorney, the church is protected. There is a deposition on the internet about one of the Churches attorney's who was present when the discussion of breaking into the opposing attorney\u2019s doctor\u2019s office was discussed \u2013 by Church Executive, lawyers and PI\u2019s. That, to me, is no different than what the GO used to do, like break into an enemy\u2019s doctors office and get their files.\n You recount in the book how you later felt badly about things you did while in the organization, including \"stealing library books that were negative toward Scientology\". (p 199) Was this type of action a common practice in the GO? OSA? Sea Org in general?\nNM: Stealing, or taking out an not returning books from libraries that put Scientology in a negative light. I know it was done for years, I would not be surprised if it is still done, but I have no proof. The libraries would though.\n How do you think Scientology management can improve the way it conducts its operations? If you were the head of the organization, what would you do differently - what would you change about Scientology practices?\nNM: If I were the head of Scientology Management at this time, I would strip it back to basics. Stop all Human Abuse and Human Rights abuses, and then have an open forum as to whether it wants to be a \"Church\" or wants to be a Self Help Group. Church\u2019s ask for titheing (based on your income) a Self Help group has fixed prices for it\u2019s counseling and services.\nScientology now has \"Fixed Donations\" the weirdest oxymoron I have ever heard.\n Looking back on your experiences in Scientology, you describe several instances in the book where you considered leaving the organization or at least leaving the Sea Org - most notably when you were ordered into the \"Rehabilitation Project Force\" while you were pregnant. (pp. 85-94.) Why did you choose to stay?\nNM: I felt I had no choice but to stay, we had no non-scientology people in our lives to give us safety and help us get on our feet. I was five months pregnant \u2013who is going to give me a job. And we literally had no money. We had been with them as a group and only with them as a group for about a decade, you lose touch with family friends etc who are not scientologists. If we left we would be put on the \u201cto be shunned list\u201d and none of our public Scientologists who had jobs for us could help us, without severe consequences to them.\nThe people who had left before us, they become non persons and you have no idea where they went. I wanted to leave without being put on the shunning list, which we eventually were able to do, that allowed us to get help from other friends who had previously left the Sea Org, but not Scientology.\n\"' In the appendix of the book you reference and discuss \"The Lucifer Effect\" by psychologist Philip Zimbardo. You cite how \"Zimbardo isolated 7 social processes that grease the slippery slope of evil,\" and acknowledge, \"I found myself in all of these seven steps, to a greater or lesser degree. ... In hindsight, I can see each on of these points were present in the apple barrel of Scientology that I lived through.\" Which of Zimbardo's steps were most applicable to your experiences in Scientology? Knowing what you know now from the knowledge in Zimbardo's book, how would you approach this differently in the future if placed in a similar situation again?\nNM: The step for me was \"Mindlessly taking the first step\", there was no internet back then. Books against Scientology had either been removed from the libraries or never been allowed to be printed. The first class I took when I left Scientology was called \"Critical Thinking\" \u2013 If I had taken that course PRIOR to Scientology, I doubt I would have mindlessly taken that first step.\nToday we have the internet, which allows us free speech, and we now have a lot of free speech about Scientology \u2013 They still try to \"Steal the library books of the internet\", but funny, now that just makes more copies.\n\"' Several popular culture references are made in the book to illustrate your experiences. You talk about the film \"Poltergeist\" and how your husband compared it to his experience of pulling you out of your psychosis (p. 219). You reference the film \"The Omen\" as a way to describe L. Ron Hubbard's view in a purported version of the Scientology level \"OT 8\" that you read on the Internet, writing, \"[Hubbard] said that he had his next mission lined up that was to come back in a healthy body and join politics - a modern-day Damien from The Omen.\" (p. 202) Scientology has itself been the subject of depictions in popular culture, for example the Obie Award-winning satirical musical \"A Very Merry Unauthorized Children's Scientology Pageant\", and the Emmy-nominated parody episode \"Trapped in the Closet\" by the comedy program \"South Park\". Have you seen any parodies or depictions of Scientology in popular culture? What are your thoughts about them?\nNM: These were all great shows. I went to the \"Unauthorized Children\u2019s Scientology Pageant\", with my youngest son who had been through the roughest parts of my mental collapse with me, and we just laughed and laughed. It was so great. If it\u2019s in your town, don\u2019t miss it.\nThe \"South Park\" episode was great. I kept it on my replay for months so I could watch again with friends (ex Scn or never Scn) who had missed it.\n Do you have any thoughts or advice for others either curious to find out more information about Scientology or those seeking to leave the organization?\nNM: If you are thinking about joining, stick to the internet for a while, a long while \u2013 they have their own websites, so you can see both sides.\nFor those seeking to leave the Sea Organization, just get up and walk out. If they touch you you have a million dollar lawsuit \u2013 but how to get the information inside to you????\n Are there any other points regarding your experiences that you would like to elaborate on or explain?\nNM: I wish the public, especially America, would not be so star struck that they ignore the Human Rights Abuses happening within our own borders, or just find it too had to believe.\nA friend of mine told a famous actress my story, and she couldn\u2019t believe it, come to find out another friend of theirs had reported the same thing and they had simply thought she was delusional.\n\"' Nancy Many, thank you for taking the time to participate in this interview with \"Wikinews\".\nNM: You\u2019re Welcome.\nSources.\n __NOEDITSECTION__"}

Until President Museveni publicly spoke out, this proposal was widely supported by the ruling majority party, the National Resistance Movement (NRM), and, as a result, was expected to easily pass with a significant number of votes in its favor. \nIn a nation where homosexuality is already a criminal offense punishable by up to fourteen years in jail, this bill would raise that penalty to life in prison. It would also dole out the death penalty for any offense categorized as \"aggravated homosexuality\"\u2014meaning a case in which one of the participants is either a minor, HIV-positive, or a \"serial offender.\" \nMuseveni stressed in this statement on Wednesday, that the Member of Parliament who drafted the legislation in question, although he is a member of the NRM, was not following government policy and did so solely as an individual.\nMuseveni, who admitted being at the center of widespread international criticism, said in the same statement that this matter was now a \"foreign policy issue,\" and therefore his government, Parliament included, \"must take into account [Uganda's] foreign policy interests.\" \nCase in point, Sweden has since threatened to cut financial support to the small African nation if this bill does in fact go through. In addition, numerous other world powers over the past weeks have contacted Museveni directly to elaborate upon their objections. \nFollowing which, a frustrated Museveni told the , \"The Prime Minister of Canada came to see me and what was he talking about? Gays. Prime Minister Gordon Brown came to see me and what was he talking about? Gays. Mrs. Clinton rang me. What was she talking about? Gays.\"\nIn light of all that has occurred, Museveni told his party that the issue as of today was no longer a parliamentary one, and that it is to be discussed and handled accordingly by him and his cabinet alone.

It releases hormones that help control blood sugar levels and keep arteries in good condition by preventing blockages with an anti-inflammatory. \nBelly fat releases inflammatory substances called and it is these that are trapped by the fat on curvy hips, bottoms and thighs. Cytokines also latch upon muscles and the liver, and can cause resistance to insulin, an important chemical. A lack of fat in the areas identified can also lead to metabolic chaos such as that which occurs in Cushing's syndrome.\n\"The idea that body fat distribution is important to health has been known for some time,\" explained Manolopoulos \"However is it only very recently that thigh fat and a larger hip circumference have been shown to promote health, that lower body fat is protective by itself.\" He stated that future research might even seek ways to ensure people have a healthy layer of fatty curves and that further study may be required to better understand the health effects.\nSources.\n "}

Would you trust that your name is going to instead end up on a mailing list for the Obama people to start asking you for campaign donations for him and other causes?\"\n\"Besides,\" Limbaugh added, \"We've already donated to Haiti.

We are the most charitable and the most generous people on the face of the earth. Each and every time a natural disaster like this happens, we step up. We are there. We have yet another crisis simply too good to waste. This will play right into Obama's hands. He's humanitarian, compassionate.

That's why he couldn't wait to get out there, could not wait to get out there.\"\nRobertson's remarks on Thursday were also considered to be inflammatory when he suggested on his television show, \"The 700 Club\" that the current situation in Haiti is a direct result of a deal Haitians made with Satan in the late 1700s. \nRobertson stated that the Haitian people in that time, \"were under the heel of the French, uh, you know Napoleon the 3rd and whatever, and they got together and swore a pact to the Devil. They [the Haitian leaders] said, 'We will serve you [Satan] if you'll get us free from the French.' True story. And so the Devil said, 'Okay, it's a deal.\u2019 And, uh, they kicked the French out, you know, with the Haitians revolted and got themselves free.

They need to have and we need to pray for them a great turning to God and out of this tragedy I'm optimistic something good may come. But right now we're helping the suffering people and the suffering is unimaginable.\"\nWhen asked about these two statements during his press briefing Thursday, White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs replied to them both respectively, \"In times of great crisis, there are always people that say really stupid things. I don't know how anybody could sit where [they] do, having enjoyed the success that [they have], and not feel some measure of sorrow for what has happened in Haiti. I think to use the power of your pulpit to try to convince those not to help their brothers and sisters is sad. My sense is that most people, though, because they understand we're part of an amazing world, won't listen and instead will seek to help those that they know, because it is through no fault of their own, have suffered an unspeakable tragedy.\"\nChris Roslan, spokesperson for the network that broadcasts Robertson's show defended the remarks stating, \"Dr. Robertson never stated that the earthquake was God's wrath. If you watch the entire video segment, Dr. Robertson's compassion for the people of Haiti is clear. He called for prayer for them.\"\nRush Limbaugh and the radio network that carries his show still have yet to reply to the criticism from The White House and elsewhere."}

This plea was part of a plea bargain that he agreed to which would shorten his jail term if he cooperated with authorities. \nArenas, 28, was charged with the crime after he allegedly pulled an unloaded gun on a teammate in the team's locker room on December 21, which he says was a joke on the teammate. Arenas was later found to have been keeping firearms in his locker after an investigation by police and the NBA.\nMeanwhile, Arenas has been suspended for an indefinite time by NBA commissioner David Stern without pay. This action has also gained support among the Washington Wizards and its players, according to the team.\nAccording to Arenas, he stored four guns in the locker room, all of them being unloaded. When asked for his reasoning, he cited that he had young children and did not want the guns in his home around them. He also said that he did not know that keeping the guns in the locker room was a violation of Washington D.C.'s gun laws, which have grown very strict recently.\nOn December 19, two days before the incident, Arenas and teammate Javaris Crittenton got into a heated argument about gambling debts on the team's private jet. Crittenton, on whom Arenas pulled the gun, is not known whether to be carrying a gun at the time of the incident, or if he pulled the gun on Arenas. A police raid of his home yielded no results, and Crittenton has not been charged in the matter.\nAntawn Jamison, another star Wizard player and friend of Arenas, has not spoken with Arenas since he was charged. \"Hopefully he's doing better than what I'd be doing in the situation or better than I expect. But one thing about Gilbert, he's a tough-minded individual,\" Jamison commented on the situation.\n\"I'm a goof ball and that's what I am,\" says Arenas about the situation, \"So, even doing something like this, I'm going to make fun of it and that's how I am,\" he added.\nArenas, 28, has been selected to three NBA-All-Star teams. He recently scored his 10,000th career point in November. Arenas also holds the NBA record for most points scored in a single overtime period, with 16."}

The results are based on a telephone survey of less than 1,000 voters, 7% undecided, and with a +/-3% margin of error.\nThe seat was vacated following the August 2009 death of Democratic Senator Ted Kennedy, who had held the position since 1962. Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick originally filled the vacancy with Paul G. Kirk, a former chairman of the DNC, but he must vacate the seat later this month due to a Massachusetts Law.\nThe law, which was passed in 2004, specifies that a vacated seat must be filled by a special election. This law was passed in response to the potential vacating of the seat held by Democrat John Kerry following his possible victory in the 2004 presidential election. Under the previous law, then-Governor Mitt Romney, a Republican, would have been allowed to choose a replacement.\nCoakley led Brown in the polls for all of 2009. But things changed in January 2010, when Brown began to take a slight lead.\nIf Brown wins, Democrats will lose the 60 votes necessary for cloture to end potenial Republican Senate filibusters (to delay or prevent voting by extending debate), and to guarantee final passage of the current health care bill.\nMassachusetts has not elected a Republican Senator since Edward Brooke in 1972. \nThe election will occur this coming Tuesday."}

Greg Kwiatkowski was also Jim Bagley's teammate in Benet, and his son, Joe\u00a0Kwiatkowski, was in the Panthers' starting lineup as well. \"Two of us who played at Benet together and now our son's play on [Oswego] together and for them to have a chance to play where we played is going to be a great night and great experience,\" said the senior Bagley.\u00a0\nAlumni Gym apparently still had its charm in the second half for the Redwings, whose 15\u201317 score at halftime worsened into an 11-point deficit in the third quarter. Benet fell behind with a score of 21\u201329 at the start of the fourth quarter. From that point, the Redwings' defense began to kick in.\u00a0Oswego could make only 2 of its 13 field goals in the third quarter. Benet's offense also gained momentum as center Frank Kaminsky scored all of his 9 points in the fourth quarter. A shot by senior Mike Runger brought the score to 31\u201331, and two consecutive driving layups by David Sobolewski gave Benet the lead that would last for the rest of the game.\u00a0\n\"We hit a dry spell there, but let's give credit where credit is due. Defense wins games and they are the best defensive team we've faced all year,\" said Oswego coach Kevin Schnable.\nBenet's Matt Parisi led his team with 15 points, and Sobolewski scored 12. Oswego's\u00a0Andrew Ziemnik also scored 12.\u00a0"}

According to the report, 59% of those surveyed said that government sanctioned corruption was a more pressing concern to them than insecurity (54%) or unemployment (52%).\nThe report adds that more than half the population had to pay out at least one bribe in 2009. Furthermore, in a country where the economic output is only $425 per person, the average bribe cost nearly $160.

The state senator from Wrentham beat Massachusetts's Attorney General, Martha Coakley, in a closely watched race that many believe may have a nationwide impact.\nWith higher than expected turnout \u2014 despite snow and rain blanketing much of the state \u2014 Brown won with 51.9% of the vote, as Coakley lagged behind closely with 47.1% of the vote in a state generally considered to be heavily Democratic. The race garnered national attention when Brown came from behind in opinion polls to take a last-minute lead, leaving Democrats scrambling. Meanwhile, Independent Libertarian Joseph L. Kennedy, who has no relation to the late Senator Kennedy, ran under the Liberty ticket on the ballot and only garnered one percent of the vote with 22,237 votes.\nSecretary of the Commonwealth William F. Galvin predicted earlier in the day that turnout would be 40 to 55 percent. Galvin was quote as saying, \u201cWe\u2019ve been in touch with many of our city and town clerks to monitor turnout. They uniformly tell us that turnout is brisk, that interest is strong.\u201d\nGalvin added, \u201cWe\u2019re particularly seeing a high level of interest in some of the suburban communities. Traditionally cities tend to vote somewhat later. But we have seen a number of communities (with) lines, and people standing in lines, very patiently, in the snow.\u201d His office sent out 105,000 absentee ballots.\nBrown's strongest vote came from the suburbs of Boston where independent voters, which make up a majority in Massachusetts, generally live. \nCoakley's strongest vote came from the cities, including the capital, Boston, where she won by a large margin, along with Massachusetts' second and third largest cities, Worcester and Springfield. Other large cities that went for Coakley included New Bedford, Fall River, Brockton, Lynn, Salem, and Lawrence.\nWikinews reporter Patrick Mannion noted the turnout at his polling place in Lynn was small to moderate.\nBrown has promised to be the 41st Republican senator that will end the Democrats' filibuster proof supermajority and in a ironic twist of fate possibly end health-care reform of which his predecessor Ted Kennedy called \"the cause of my life.\" \nCoakley called Brown shortly before the election was called for him to concede to him. She then went in front of supporters at Boston's Sheraton Hotel saying, \"Although our campaign ends tonight, we know that our mission continues and our work goes on.\" Coakley continued, \"I am heartbroken at the result and I know that you are also, but I know that you will get up together and continue this fight even with this result tonight.\"\nCoakley finished her speech with a slight crack in her voice by quoting Ted Kennedy's famous line from the 1980 Democratic National Convention, \"The work begins anew, the hope rises again, and the dream lives on.\"\nMeanwhile, at Boston's Park Plaza Hotel, Brown gave his victory speech to supporters saying, \"I\u2019ll bet they can hear all this cheering down in Washington, D.C.\" Brown continued, saying, \"And I hope they\u2019re paying close attention, because tonight the independent voice of Massachusetts has spoken.\"\nBrown added, \"This Senate seat belongs to no one person and no political party \u2014 and as I have said before, and you said loud and clear today, it is the people\u2019s seat.\" He continued, \"The people, by their votes, have now filled the office themselves, and I am ready to go to Washington without delay.\"\nBrown was joined on stage by his wife, Gail Huff, a reporter for local television station WCVB-TV, and his two daughters Arianna and Ayla Brown. Ayla was previously a contestant on the reality singing show \"American Idol\". Brown said, \"I rely as always, on Gail's love and support and that of our beautiful daughters.\" \nBrown jokingly added, \"And just in case anyone who's watching throughout the country they're both available. No, no. No. Only kidding, only kidding. Only kidding, only kidding. Arianna... Arianna's, definitely not available. But Ayla is. This is Arianna. This is Ayla. I can see I'm going to get in trouble when I get home.\"\nBrown closed by saying, \"I\u2019m Scott Brown. I'm from Wrentham. I drive a truck, and I am nobody\u2019s senator but yours.\"\nPresident Barack Obama phoned both candidates Tuesday night, congratulating Brown on a well-run campaign and saying he is eager to work with him on the urgent problems facing Massachusetts voters and all Americans.\nCoakley noted the President's call in her concession speech saying, \u201cHe actually just called me before I came onstage to say that we can\u2019t win them all, and he knows that better than any, as he told me. But he appreciates what I did and what you did, and he said to extend his heartfelt thanks to everyone who worked on the campaign.\u201d\nBrown's response to the President's call was, \"Would you like me to drive the truck down to Washington so you can see it?\" Brown was referring to his 2005 GMC Canyon pickup truck which became an icon of his campaign, which featured in commericals portraying him as an everyday, regular joe Massachusetts citizen. The pickup truck was mocked by President Obama when he made a campaign stop on Sunday to drum up support for the lagging Coakley.\nThis led Brown to quip, \"I didn't mind when President Obama came here and criticized me \u2014 that happens in campaigns. But when he criticized my truck, that's where I draw the line.\"\nSenator-elect Brown will fill the remaining two years of Ted Kennedy's term. Brown will replace Senator Paul Kirk, a longtime friend of Ted Kennedy who was holding the seat in the interim until the special election was concluded. \nThe last time Massachusetts elected a Republican was in 1972 when they re-elected Edward Brooke, the state's first African-American senator, to a second term. Brooke first ran in 1966 and was elected then. \nHowever, the seat that Ted Kennedy held, which is the Class 1 seat, was held by a Republican until 1952 when Henry Cabot Lodge lost his re-election bid to Ted's older brother, John F. Kennedy, who would later become the 35th President of the United States. Ted Kennedy won the seat in a special election in 1962 against Lodge's son, George C. Lodge. Kennedy held the seat for 46 years until dying of brain cancer in August 2009.\nReaction.\nMany local politicans spoke about the victory, Mayor of Boston Tom Menino who recently began his fifth term earlier this month said, \u201cI never thought I\u2019d see the day when a Republican replaces Ted Kennedy. I think Scott Brown caught the wave of anger that\u2019s out there, and the wave of anti-Obama.\"\nRepresentative Ed Markey, the Democrat who represents Massachusetts's 7th congressional district, plans to pass the health care bill despite the victory. Markey said, \"As Sen. Kennedy would say, the cause endures, and the dream will never die.\u201d\nRepresentative Barney Frank, the Democrat who represents Massachusetts's 4th congressional district, was blunt on Coakley's loss. \"Martha Coakley was a lousy candidate. She let herself get involved in a personality debate.\"\nCoakley was blamed by some Democratic officials for running a bad campaign and not campaigning enough for the seat, especially with taking a vacation right before the new year to the Caribbean.\nMassachusetts Senate President Therese Murray said, \"Money was the issue after the primary. We just couldn't get people's attention.\" \nFormer Republican Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney, who back in 1994 took on the late Senator Kennedy for this same seat in a heated election, was quoted as saying, \"When it comes to the liberal arrogance in Washington, D.C. Scott Brown's victory is the shot heard around the world.\" \nRomney added, \"He\u2019s run a good campaign and he\u2019s made it clear that the ignorance in Washington has been rejected.\" Romney was also quoted saying, \"This is really a referendum, if you will, on the Barack Obama agenda...I think the people here in Massachusetts, in the bluest of blue states, are saying they don\u2019t like this kind of arrogance.\"\nPoliticians from around the country also chimed in such as Howard Dean, the former Governor of Vermont, a candidate in the 2004 presidential election and the former head of the Democratic National Committee, who was responsible for the \"50 States\" strategy which focused on winning Democratic seats in all 50 states.\nDean speaking on MSNBC said, \"We\u2019ve got to be tougher. I\u2019ve said Democrats haven\u2019t been tough enough.\" He added, \"I don\u2019t think this was a backlash on health care reform, I think it was a backlash on Washington.\"\nSenator Robert Menendez, Democrat from New Jersey, who is the chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, said, \"I have no interest in sugar coating what happened in Massachusetts. There is a lot of anxiety in the country right now. Americans are understandably impatient. The truth is Democrats understand the economic anger voters feel, that\u2019s in large part why we did well in 2006 and 2008.\u201d\nSenate Minority Leader, Mitch McConnell, Republican from Kentucky, said \"There\u2019s a reason the nation was focused on this race. The voters in Massachusetts, like Americans everywhere, have made it abundantly clear where they stand on health care. They don\u2019t want this bill and want Washington to listen to them.\""}

Officials in the university's Computer Services department (OUCS) say too much of the network's bandwidth is taken up by people using such services, slowing down the network for others. \nSpotify, which has more than 2.7 million users in the UK, allows users to listen to music stored on other users' computers over the internet, either for free with adverts, or without adverts for a monthly fee. While the university allows students to use its network for free for academic purposes, it places restrictions on peer-to-peer sites, where data is shared between many connected computers rather than being downloaded from a central source, as these require more bandwidth. \nStudents were said to be unhappy with the move. One said that she was \"shocked\" at the ban, another called it \"discrimination against music lovers\", and another said that he could \"see nothing wrong\" with students using Spotify, as \"it's not as if every single person is on it every single hour of the day.\" There were reports, however, that the ban had inconsistencies, with students at some colleges still able to connect to the service.\nA university spokeswoman said: \"The university provides free internet access for students because it's an educational resource.

News reports have suggested that the claim originated in a 1999 article in the popular science magazine \"New Scientist\", and was picked up by the IPCC when it was quoted in a 2005 report by the World Wildlife Fund.\nJairam Ramesh, India's minister of Environment and Forests, had criticized the estimate when the report was initially released. After the announcement, Ramesh reiterated his criticism and told \"The Times of India\": \"The health of the glaciers is a cause of grave concern, but the IPCC's alarmist position that they would melt by 2035 was not based on an iota of scientific evidence.\"\nAccording to \"The Times\" (UK), most glaciologists believe it would take hundreds of years to melt the Himalayan glaciers, with some doubting that it will ever happen. There is evidence of glaciers growing in the neighboring Karakoram mountain range.\nMichael Zemp, of the World Glacier Monitoring Service told CNN that, \"There are simply no observations available to make these sorts of statements.\"\n\"The other thing is that the report says the glaciers are receding faster than anywhere else in the world. We simply do not have the glacier change measurements. The Himalayas are among those regions with the fewest available data\", Zemp added. \nNevertheless, the IPCC maintains that the melting of the glaciers is a concern to the region, which is home to over one billion people. It stands by its overall conclusion that \"mass losses from glaciers and reductions in snow cover over recent decades are projected to accelerate throughout the 21st century, reducing water availability, hydropower potential, and changing seasonality of flows in regions supplied by meltwater from major mountain ranges.\"\nThe IPCC had recently come under fire during the 2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference, when selectively leaked e-mails, hacked from the University of East Anglia, reportedly showed that some scientists were attempting to suppress findings by other climatologists that did not agree with their own findings."}

The injuries included severe damage to many of his internal organs.\nAuthorities identified this little-known reporter who specialized in economics as Konstantin Popov. Popov was one of the cofounders of a small regional newspaper publisher and a local magazine called \"Tema\". In a country where police brutality and corruption\u2014especially against journalists\u2014is not uncommon, the editor-in-chief of \"Tema\", Konstantin Karpachyov, said it was unlikely Popov's murder was in any way related to his work.\nHowever, Karpachyov went on to say that, \"This could happen to absolutely anyone. It demonstrates the police terror is aimed against everybody.\"\n\"The only thing different about this case is that he happened to be a journalist, so it became a high-profile public case. But the same thing happens every day,\" said Svetlana Gannushkina, of Russia's Civic Assistance committee. \"Usually the cases are just closed down because there's no evidence, nobody testifies, and it's impossible to get to the bottom of it.\"\nUpon learning Popov's identity, numerous members of the state-controlled media strongly criticized the police for their passive response to the actions allegedly committed by one of their own. Following which, news conferences were called, and before long Popov's case began to draw national attention.\nThis resulted in the holding cell where Popov's beating occurred being closed down. In addition, the deputy police chief resigned as well as supervisor of the precinct in question. The Tomsk police chief apologized. The suspected officer, Alexei Mitayev, was dismissed from the force, arrested, and is said to have since confessed to this crime. Mitayev cited that \"stress due to family problems\" is what led to his actions against Popov.\nThe chairman of the Tomsk branch of the Union of Journalists of Russia said that a source close to the investigation told him that Popov was not only beaten but was also \"tortured\" and \"violated\" with a foreign object. \n\"Hands off journalists!\" the journalist union said in a statement on its website. According to the United States-based Committee to Protect Journalists, as far as they know, \"since 2000, at least seventeen Russian journalists have been killed due to their work, and the killers have been convicted in only one case.\"\nPresident Dmitry Medvedev said that such police misconduct was not only angering the Russian public, but was also undermining the state's authority.

The Old Bailey, a London court, heard that Frances Inglis, 57, injected Tom, 22, with heroin and gave her a life sentence.\nTom had been injured in a street fight in July 2007 and was put in an ambulance depite his desire not to be hospitalised. The ambulance door was opened three times; the third time Tom jumped out and sustained injuries that left him in a coma. He became mute and dependant on 24-hour care. His only method of communication was to squeeze a hand.\nFrances was told that if she wanted Tom to die legally then she could ask the High Court to allow his food and water to be withdrawn, so that he would starve to death. Frances told the court \"I know Tom \u2013 no way would he have wanted to live totally dependent. I can remember saying I felt I would rather he go to heaven than to hell on earth. I know Tom would not want to live. He had lost his life.\"\n\"I couldn't bear the thought of Tom dying of thirst or hunger,\" she said of the idea of food and water withdrawal. \"To me that would be so cruel, so cruel. To die slowly like that would be horrible.\" Instead she used the Internet to research Tom's condition and concluded that a heroin overdose would be the most painless method available. A learning disabilities worker with no convictions, she concluded two grams was sufficient to kill and began spending time in areas she believed drugs were on sale \u2013 outside the local station, job centre and needle exchanges.\nFrances was determined to release Tom from his \"living hell\" and said she had \"no choice\" in the matter. \"I asked myself what I would want,\" she said. \"I would want someone to love me enough to help me die. That's why I thought heroin \u2013 a painless, peaceful death.\" She obtained her two grams and stole syringes from Tom's hospital before injecting him, but he was revived by nurses and she was charged with attempted murder. She was bailed but barred from contacting her son.\nFourteen months later she obtained access to Tom by posing as his aunt and placed superglue in the lock of his door, further barricading it with an oxygen cylinder and a wheelchair. It took staff thirty minutes to break in, by which time Frances had injected one of Tom's arms and both his thighs with heroin. This time he died.\nFrances had left a letter to her family in which she talked of her concerns for her other two sons and dog, as well as the running of the house, expecting a murder arrest. On one bed she left a photograph of Tom as well as a prayer written by his girlfriend. Police also found older letter by Frances, one of which read \"People keep saying Tom is not suffering. How can they know how he feels?\" \nShe was asked if guilty of murder and attempted murder, to which she responded \"I don't see it as killing or murder. The definition of murder is to take someone's life with malice in your heart. I did it with love in my heart, for Tom, so I don't see it as murder. I knew what I was doing was against the law. I don't know what name they would call it but I knew that the law would say it was wrong. I believed it would have been Tom's choice to have been allowed to die rather than have the intervention to keep him alive.\"\nThe jury \"could not have had a more difficult case,\" according to Judge Brian Barker, but he told them nobody was allowed to override the law. Ten members of the jury agreed, but two sided with Frances, leaving a conviction by majority verdict. The jury foreman was greeted by cries of \"shame on you\" from France's relatives, for which they were ejected from the building. \"We can all understand the emotion and the unhappiness that you were experiencing,\" Barker told Frances, later adding \"You knew you were breaking society's conventions, you knew you were breaking the law, and you knew the consequences.\" He ordered her to serve a minimum of nine years.\n\"What this case and a number of others have exposed,\" said France's eldest son, Alex, \"is a need for a complete rethink of existing laws in regard to people that have been, and will be, in the same position as Tom. How can it be legal to withhold food and water, which means a slow and painful death, yet illegal to end all suffering in a quick, calm and loving way? It's cruel, inhumane and illogical... We have a duty of care to them and we should not allow this situation to continue. It should not be left to a wife, husband, mother, father, sister or brother to have to end their suffering, and be convicted for murder.\" Detective Chief Inspector Steve Collin, who was in charge of the case, flatly disagreed. \"There's no such thing as a mercy killing in law.\"\n\"I want to say that all of the family and Tom's girlfriend support my mum 100%. All those who loved and were close to Tom have never seen this as murder, but as a loving and courageous act,\" said Alex. "}

It is exactly this kind of irresponsibility that makes clear reform is necessary.\"\nObama's two key proposals were to limit the types of operations that a bank may undertake and to limit the size of the largest financial firms.\nUnder the proposals banks would be prevented from owning or investing in hedge fund or a private equity fund. Nor would they be allowed to sponsor such funds. To limit size of financial institutions, further consolidation of the financial sector by restricting growth in the market share of their liabilities.\nObama called the restrictions on banking operations the \"Volcker Rule\" in reference to Paul Volcker, the chair of the President's Economic Recovery Advisory Board. These activities are \"unrelated to serving their customers,\" Obama said.\nAccording to Obama, the current \"economic crisis began as a financial crisis, when banks and financial institutions took huge, reckless risks in pursuit of quick profits and massive bonuses. When the dust settled, and this binge of irresponsibility was over, several of the world's oldest and largest financial institutions had collapsed, or were on the verge of doing so. Markets plummeted, credit dried up, and jobs were vanishing by the hundreds of thousands each month. We were on the precipice of a second Great Depression.\"\nThe President said his administration is seeking to protect consumers and close loopholes that allowed financial products such as credit default swaps without oversight. The goal would be to strengthen capital and liquidity requirements to make the financial system more stable. Another goal of Obama's reforms would be to ensure that the failure of one firm could not take the entire economy.\n\"We've come through a terrible crisis. The American people have paid a very high price. We simply cannot return to business as usual. That's why we're going to ensure that Wall Street pays back the American people for the bailout. That's why we're going to rein in the excess and abuse that nearly brought down our financial system,\" Obama said in closing.\nBefore any of the proposals can go into effect, they will have to be passed into law by both houses of the United States Congress."}

Their 38-foot yacht, the \"Lynn Rival\", was later found abandoned. Days later, pirates confirmed they were in fact holding the couple hostage within Somalia's borders. \nA spokeswoman for the British Foreign Office told media in a statement on Friday that the government's policy was to not \"make or facilitate concessions to hostage-takers.\" She added, the Office is, however, still closely \"monitoring the situation\" and \"doing everything it can\" to secure the couple's safe release.\nThe Chandlers' captors have demanded a ransom payment of US$7 million (\u00a34.3 million), but the British government has refused to pay it, in line with their policy.\nOn Friday, the pirates granted the Chandlers separate telephone interviews with UK-based media outlet ITN. According to the interviews, the couple pleaded for help and alleged that they have been \"physically attacked,\" separated and \"treated as a captive animal\" in solitary confinement at the hands of their captors.\nRachel Chandler told ITN that \"dying would actually be an easy way out\" and how she wanted to see her husband \"at least once before we die.\"\nThe validity of these threats are not known. According to \"The Hindu\", pirates often make empty threats of execution, but rarely harm the captives.\nPiracy is especially rife in the waters near Somalia, a nation, due to an ongoing civil war, that has not had a functioning government in place since 1991. Islamic extremist groups, such as al-Shabaab, as well as various warlords and pirate gangs control most of the nation. The only exception is the besieged capital of Mogadishu, which is protected primarily by UN peace-keepers and other foreign troops. \nAccording to the International Maritime Bureau, there were 406 reported pirate attacks worldwide in 2009, compared to approximately 290 the year before. During both years, more than 50% of these incidents occurred off the coast of the Horn of Africa. "}

The death toll, as of Friday, is estimated to be 110,000. It is thought that the chances of survival are so slim that it is not worth the resources required for a successful rescue operation. Byrs called the decision to end the rescue effort \"heartbreaking\", but added that it had been advised by experts.\nOnly yesterday, an 84-year-old woman was found\u2014severely injured and dehydrated\u2014in the rubble of her home, and Emmannuel Buso, aged 21, was rescued by an Israeli search team.

There is currently no information on whether the Israeli team will also stop their rescue efforts.\nShortly after the announcement, a French rescue team reported that it was trying to save a man who is trapped under the ruins of a hotel and supermarket. They cannot yet see the man, who said that he saw the team's light, and that as many as five other people are trapped with him. The rescue team said that it could take two hours to rescue the man.\nIt is hoped that removing focus from the rescue operation will allow more money and effort to be diverted to the logistically difficult relief effort, which has already seen planes arriving at the now operational Port-au-Prince airport at a rate of 150 per day and a United States Navy hospital ship, the USNS Comfort, moored outside the partly-operational seaport.\nAt least 130,000 people have been relocated out of Port-au-Prince, say the UN, whose World Food Program has provided approximately 2 million meals to starving people and calls the current operation \"the most complex operation WFP has ever launched\".\nThe magnitude 7 earthquake is estimated to have made 1.5 million people homeless, and some estimations of the death toll rise as high as 200,000.

This is the conclusion of Robin Dunbar, Professor of Evolutionary Anthropology at the University of Oxford. Dunbar originally carried out research in this area in the 1990s, looking at social groups from modern offices back to ancient villages. He found that the neocortex in the brain, used for thinking and language, cannot cope with more than 150 friends \u2013 a conclusion known as \"Dunbar's number\". Groups of people tend to be limited to about 150 as, beyond that, social cohesion suffers. Revisiting the topic, Dunbar's view is that this number has not increased even with online methods of keeping in touch with friends, like Facebook.\nDunbar compared the online activity of those with thousands of internet friends and those with hundreds, before concluding that there was no appreciable difference in their levels of activity. He defined a friend as someone that the individual cared about and made contact with at least yearly. \"The interesting thing is that you can have 1,500 friends but when you actually look at traffic on sites, you see people maintain the same inner circle of around 150 people that we observe in the real world. [...] People obviously like the kudos of having hundreds of friends but the reality is that they\u2019re unlikely to be bigger than anyone else\u2019s\", he observed. \nAnother conclusion of his study was that women were better at keeping friendships going on Facebook than men \u2013 \"girls are much better at maintaining relationships just by talking to each other. Boys need to do physical stuff together\". The full results of his study are due to be published later in 2010.\nDunbar, 52, has been an Oxford professor since 2007, having previously been Professor of Evolutionary Psychology at the University of Liverpool.

Her body was found over twenty years later in Coniston Water, in the Lake District, Northern England, leading to her being dubbed the \"Lady in the Lake\" by police, after the Raymond Chandler novel.\nThe Prison Service state Park was found hanging in his cell at Garth Prison, unconscious, at 8am local time. \"Staff and paramedics attended but Mr Park was pronounced dead at 9.40am\", a spokesman added. An investigation has been launched by the Prisons and Probation Ombudsman, responsible for investigating deaths in custody; but suicide is suspected. His son, Jeremy, who had been fighting for his father's release, said \"[w]e are all completely devastated and still believe his innocence 100%.\"\nPark was jailed for life in January 2005, with a minimum period of fifteen years, for his wife's murder after a ten-week trial at Manchester Crown Court. Carol Park was killed with an ice axe, then her body concealed in Coniston Water. She was not found until August 1997, when divers found her weighted corpse 70 feet deep. Park had claimed that his wife had left him for another man. His appeal against conviction was turned down in 2008, with the Court of Appeal saying that the geological evidence he wished to challenge was only one factor of the \"strong circumstantial case\" proving his guilt."}

Subsequently, fire engines arrived at the hotels and the police and soldiers together barred entry.\nThe next blast occurred at the Babylon hotel, which is often used by the government for meeting. Subsequently, another car bomb blasted the Hamra hotel compound, which hosts multiple news agencies.\nAccording to witnesses, gunmen dressed in business suits had fired the checkpoint guards. During the firing, the building gate was opened. The van entered and was detonated. The explosion took place in a section where there were residential homes. The blast opened a gigantic crater, 12 feet wide and 6 feet deep only about 50 feet from the hotel.

Dr Alina Rodriguez, from the School of Public Health at Imperial College, London, and a team of researchers from various European universities studied nearly 8,000 children from the north of Finland; 87 of these were ambidextrous (mixed-handed). Parents, teachers and the children themselves assessed language skills, academic achievement and behaviour. At ages 7 and 8, the ambidextrous children had double the rate of language problems and were twice as likely to have problems at school. At age 15 and 16, the proportion of those with ADHD symptoms was twice as many in the ambidextrous group, and their ADHD symptoms tended to be worse. Ambidextrous children in the study also had a higher rate of language problems.\nThe number of people who are ambidextrous is unclear, with estimates ranging from 1% to 5%. Scientists do not know why some people use both hands when the majority of people prefer to use one predominantly. The theory is that there is something different in the brains of ambidextrous people, although Rodriguez says that more work in the area is needed. \nA person who prefers using their right hand will have a more dominant left hemisphere of the brain, which is the part of the brain for language skills. Rodriguez and her researchers have suggested that the right hemisphere of the brain of an ambidextrous child is weaker compared to that of a right-handed child, increasing their susceptible to problems with attention. Previous suggestions about the causes of ADHD include the possibility that a person's right hemisphere has weaker function. Earlier studies have drawn links between dyslexia and being ambidextrous, and other studies are looking at the part that differences between the two sides of the brain play in language skills and psychosis.\nRodriguez emphasised that the research, published in the journal \"Pediatrics\" in the United States, did not show that all ambidextrous children would have such problems, pointing out that most of the children in the survey did not develop them. \"Our study suggests that handedness is really a marker for atypical foetal brain development \u2014 showing that the brain is working in a different way to the norm\", she said, adding that other studies have shown atypical brain development to be associated with extraordinary creativeness. She also suggested that the results may assist schools and health care workers in targeting children at risk of problems. "}

This prompted Brown and Cowen, who had been discussing similar issues in London, to make an unscheduled trip to Ulster in an attempt to attempt to prevent the collapse of the Irish political system due to a conflict about the DUP's refusal to transfer the Irish policing and justice system from London to Belfast. On his way to the failed meeting, McGuinness said that he was \"frustrated\" that Sinn F\u00e9in had been stalling for time by waiting three years for the devolution of power.\nSinn F\u00e9in\u2014a political party promoting an independent Ireland\u2014called the meeting, before it occurred, a defining moment in the crisis.

It also demands that, before any transfer attempts begin, the Parades Commission\u2014which is responsible for the conditions of a number of contentious marches\u2014be disbanded. Sinn F\u00e9in responds to this by accusing the DUP of giving the organisers of the parades, the loyalist Orange Order, a veto.

Captain Robert Semrau's case is believed to be a military and legal first.\nSemrau, 38, is facing four charges for the 2008 death. He is accused of second-degree murder, attempted murder, behaving in a disgraceful manner, and negligently performing a military duty. It is alleged that he shot the man twice despite him being an unarmed and \"seriously wounded\" prisoner.\nCourt documents set a scene in which 36-year-old Semrau was in charge of a small group of soldiers caught in an ambush on October 19 last year. The Canadians were mentoring some new Afghan recruits, who were under British command. A United States Apache assault helicopter provided assistance to the group, who were in Lashkar Gah, Helmand, strafing the area.\nAfter beating back their attackers the soldiers discovered a fighter with injuries deemed to be so severe that medical aid would be ineffective, along with a dead man. He was disarmed, his assault rifle having been captured. Shortly afterwards, with only Semrau near the man, two gunshots were heard. At least one eyewitness claims to have watched Semrau shooting the militant with his field rifle. Troops then moved on and the man's body was never recovered.\nCaptain Semrau was not investigated for two months, when his superiors heard of the alleged killing. He was ultimately arrested by the Canadian Forces National Investigation Service a month later and charged. He is now set to go on trial before Colonel Mario Duti, a military judge, and a five-member panel.\n\"The Canadian Press\" contacted Michel Drapeau, a retired lawyer and colonel. He says he believes it to be the first time Canada has launched a court martial for the death of a prisoner on the battlefield. \"It's unprecedented in many, many respects. I can't remember any such incidents in the past 50 years and in the Second World War, I don't believe there was such a court martial.\"\nThere are a few recorded instances of alleged extra-judicial killing by Canadian soldiers, but no court martials for murder. Two Canadian soldiers faced a murder charge for the death of a teenager in Somalia in 1993 but the case was dropped; some evidence emerged during the inquiry that suggested another man may also have been killed illegally. More anecdotally, Canadians have been accused of similar murders in Korea and of shooting German prisoners for revenge during the second world war."}

The case has called into question the United Kingdom's assisted suicide laws.\nBridget Gilderdale had already admitted to aiding and abetting her daughter's suicide, but the jury decided, unanimously, to acquit her of a charge of attempted murder. The presiding judge, Mr Justice Bean, had already questioned the accusation's suitability, asking prosecutor Sally Howes \"why it was considered to be in the public interest\". Once the verdict was delivered, he said, \"I do not normally comment on the verdicts of juries but in this case their decision, if I may say so, shows common sense, decency and humanity which makes jury trials so important in a case of this kind. There is no dispute that you were a caring and loving mother and that you considered that you were acting in the best interests of your daughter.\"\nGilderdale was given a 12-month conditional discharge. The case stands in contrast to the life sentence received last week by Frances Inglis, who killed her severely brain damaged son Tom by injecting him with heroin. Tom had, however, never expressed any wish to die, and his mother had ignored medical advice, while Lynn had previously attempted suicide. When this attempt had failed, her mother had assisted her in ending her life.\nThe case has brought into the limelight the debate over a person's \"right to die\" and the United Kingdom's laws on assisted suicide. Some claim that, with a new draft policy clarifying the law in the pipeline, Bridget Gilderdale should not have been prosecuted at all. A spokeswoman for the Crown Prosecution Service defended the decision to prosecute, saying that \"It was not clear cut: there was a sequence of events and the toxicologist could not prove which of these stages resulted in death,\" and that it was not certain whether Lynn Gilderdale had died from assisted suicide. Sarah Wootton, chief executive of Dignity in Dying, says that there is a \"clear ethical difference\" between asisted suicide and murder, and that the law does not take this into account. She said, \"Ultimately, the Government needs to review the law in this area, as this case highlights at present the law is a mess.\""}

In 2008 six children were killed by milk contaminated with the chemical and 300,000 fell ill.\nThe department has suspended all sales from the three companies involved. Last November, two men were executed for their roles in selling milk tainted with the chemical, which was largely distributed by Samlu Corp, a company that has since been liquidised. The executed convicts mixed up batches totalling hundreds of tonnes of melamine-tainted milk, and were among 21 people successfuly prosecuted over the contamination. Chinese dairy products were withdrawn around the world.\nThe latest finds have gone unreported for nearly a year before a provincial news service reported on the tainted products from Shandong Zibo Lusaier Dairy Co., Liaoning Tieling Wuzhou Food Co. and Laoting Kaida Refrigeration Plant. This was then picked up today by \"China Daily\", meaning it has only now come to the world's attention. No specifics are available other than that popsicles are involved.\nEarly 2009 would place the discoveries and recalls shortly after the government anounced a crackdown on malpractice in the dairy industry. Recently, two other reports have emerged of tainted milk being discovered elsewhere in China, including Shanghai. \nIt is uncertain why this is only now becoming public knowledge, althought the Shanghai case was said to be complicated by crossing provincial borders. There, reports emerged on New Year's Eve although the actual news dated back to April.\nAfter the 2008 milk scandal new food safety legislation was passed. These new laws made room for more vigourous testing and stronger recall arrangements. The government made it clear that coverups were intolerable. At the time, 22 companies were indentified as being involved in melamine-contamination in milk.\nTwo dairies recently named in state media as behind more recent incidents were on that original list, including Laoting Kaida and Shanghai Panda Dairy Co. Media reports suggest that the newer problem may have been that milk containing melimine that was never destroyed from the original discovery was then repackaged. \nThe companies involved have stated that they bought in raw milk without realising it contained the poisonous chemical. \"China Daily\" quoted an official as saying the same thing. It also stated an ex-dairy industry official had said that it was probable that further milk containing illegally high levels of the substance remained available to the Chinese consumer.\nNews organisations have tried contacting the companies involved and authorities in Guizhou province but with little success. This trend was bucked by the \"Agence France-Presse\", who reached Guizhou's health department, only to be told the reports were not correct.\nMelamine has a high nitrogen content which can make watered-down milk seem to contain extra protein. It is intended for use in manufacturing industries, in products such as concrete, plastic and fertiliser. Large quantities can cause kidney stones and kidney failure.\nSources.\n "}

They hope that the news will lead to faster progress in developing cancer treatment drugs. \nLearning how to tackle cancer stem cells is important for scientists because these cells may be the reason that tumours grow back after standard treatments such as chemotherapy or radiotherapy, as they can self-replicate or develop into other cell types. Trevor Yeung, one of the researchers from the Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine, explained the importance of tackling cancer stem cells: \"It's like trying to weed the garden. It's no good just chopping off the leaves, we need to target the roots to stop the weeds coming back.\"\nThe approach until now has been to take samples of cancer from a patient, then improve the number of stem cells in each sample before seeing whether tumours were produced in mice. Not only was this a slow process, but the samples could only be used once. In the new method, details of which were published yesterday in the \"Proceedings of the National Academy of Science\", researchers have learned how to extract samples that have high numbers of cancer stems cells from bowel cancer cell lines (cells grown in a laboratory). Working with laboratory-grown cells enables drugs to be tested on them more quickly and repeatedly.\nThe research also showed that the proportion of cancer stem cells varies between bowel cancers, with more aggressive tumours having a higher proportion. It had previously been thought that cancer stem cells were only a small part of the cells within a tumour.\nSir Walter Bodmer, who led the study, said \"We can now evaluate anti-cancer drugs better to see whether they attack cancer stem cells. If you don't attack these cells, the cancer can grow out again.\" Yeung said \"If we could target treatments against these cells specifically, we should be able to eradicate cancer completely.\" He added that the research \"should allow the development of more useful, safe and specific drugs targeting cancer stem cells.\"\nBodmer, 74, is a former Director General of the Imperial Cancer Research Fund. He was later Principal of Hertford College, Oxford, and has been a professor at Oxford as well as Stanford University. He was knighted in 1986."}

Martin Atkinson, who works for the National Trust as property manager for East Suffolk, used clues from the painting and looked at old maps to track down the viewpoint. Trees had grown, a hedgerow had been planted and boundaries had moved or disappeared, but Atkinson eventually worked out where Constable had stood. He said, \"When I discovered that I had worked out the location where Constable painted this particular masterpiece, I couldn't believe it. All the pieces of the jigsaw finally fitted together.\"\nAtkinson used an 1817 map of East Bergholt, where Constable grew up, as a reference point, but found that the view would have changed not long after the painting was completed. \"The foreground didn't fit at all, it was quite unusual as we know Constable painted it in the open air so he would have been standing in the scene. The hedgerow in his work no longer exists and there's another hedgerow that runs across the scene today which wasn't there.

As non-military technology it does not need an export license, and we would not normally need to monitor its sale and use abroad.\"\nThe statement went on to say, \"However, it is clearly of concern that it is being used as bomb detection equipment. As soon as it was brought to the attention of the Export Control Organisation and Lord Mandelson we acted urgently to put in place export restrictions which will come into force next week. We will be making an order, under the Export Control Act 2002, banning the export of this type of device to Iraq and Afghanistan.\"\nAdding, \"The reason the ban is limited to these two countries is that our legal power to control these goods is based on the risk that they could cause harm to UK and other friendly forces.\" The statement closed by saying, \"The British Embassy Baghdad has raised our concerns about the ADE651 with the Iraqi authorities.\"\nMeanwhile, the Avon and Somerset Police have arrested the managing director of the manufacturer, ATSC, 53-year old Jim McCormick on suspicion of fraud. McCormick is a former police officer from Merseyside. He has been released on bail.\nThese two events come after an investigation by the BBC's \"Newsnight\" program where they tested and revealed the device as a fraud. \nThe device, manufactured by ATSC Ltd. which operates from a former dairy in Sparkford, Somerset, contains an antenna attached to plastic hand grip which is attached to black box. It requires no battery or other power source, and is supposedly powered solely by the user's static electricity, the manufacturer claims. It can supposedly detect minute traces of explosives, drugs, human bodies, money, and even elephants provided it has the right card. \nThe black box of the device is intended to read \"programmed substance detection cards\" that are supplied with the device. The device supposedly works on the principle of \"electrostatic magnetic ion attraction\".\nNewsnight brought the device to Sidney Alford, a renowned explosives expert who advises all branches of the UK military. Alford opened up the card reader of the device which was empty. Alford said, \"Speaking as a professional, I would say that's an empty plastic case.\" Alford believes that the selling of the device is \"absolutely immoral\". He added, \"It could result in people being killed in the dozens, if not hundreds.\"\nThey then brought the \"programmed substance detection cards\" to the University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory. The cards were examined by Dr. Markus Kuhn. When the layers of the card were peeled away, it was found that cards contained nothing but RFID security tags.\n\"There is nothing to program in these cards. There is no memory. There is no microcontroller. There is no way any form of information can be stored,\" said Kuhn. Adding, \"These are the cheapest bit of electronics that you can get that look vaguely electronic and are sufficiently flat to fit inside a card.\"\nThe device along with several others has been previously tested by Sandia National Laboratories in the United States. The test concluded that \"none have ever performed better than random chance.\u201d The United States Department of Justice has warned law enforcement agencies against buying the device.\nThe device first came to light in November of 2009, by \"The New York Times\" after an increasing amount of car bomb attacks were occurring in Iraq, including the devastating bombing on October 25, 2009, that killed 155. The bombers drove through checkpoints that were equipped with the ADE 651. However, the American magician and skeptic James Randi has been skeptical of the devices since at least October 2008. He offered a $1,000,000 prize if someone could prove the device worked.\nDespite what was brought to light by the \"Times\", the Iraqi Interior Ministry stood by the device. Major General Jehad al-Jabiri, who is the head of the Ministry of the Interior\u2019s General Directorate for Combating Explosives, said, \"Whether it\u2019s magic or scientific, what I care about is it detects bombs.\" \nIn response to the tests by Sandia Labs and the warning from the Justice Department, \"I don\u2019t care about Sandia or the Department of Justice or any of them. I know more about this issue than the Americans do. In fact, I know more about bombs than anyone in the world,\" the general said.\nEven after the \"Newsnight\" program earlier this week, the Interior Minstry still stands by them, \"We conducted several tests on them, and found them successful. In addition, we have a series of achievements officially documented by the Baghdad operations centre, from all the provinces, which establish that these devices detected thousands of bombs, booby-trapped houses and car bombs, and we've noticed a reduction of bombing activities to less than 10 per cent of what it was,\" said General al-Jabiri.\nInterior Minister Jawad al-Bolani even chimed in saying, \"The thing is, the instrument is being operated by a user. Not all those who use the instrument are fully trained, the user needs to be alert and adept at using it.\" The interior ministry has spent over $85 million on the devices, which cost from $40,000 to $60,000, much higher then price given by ATSC, $16,000, despite being warned by the ministry's inspector general, Aqeel al-Turaihi. \n\"There was corruption associated with this contract and we referred to this and submitted our report to the Minister of the Interior,\" al-Turaihi told Reuters. He added, \"We said that the company which you made a contract with is not well-regarded internationally in the field of explosives detectors, and the price is very high and not commensurate with the abilities of this device.\"\nMeanwhile Iraqi Members of Parliament have called the Iraq Security Forces to stop using the devices. Hussain al-Falluji, a Sunni MP, said, \"I proposed to parliament the withdrawal of these machines from service, the formation of an investigative committee and that Iraq recover its money.\" Others in parliament are backing his suggestion.\nIraqi citizens are also criticizing the devices. Aqeel Yousif Yaqoub, a 39 year-old man who was caught in the October 25th bombing, said, \"If they were effective, how did the suicide car bomb reach this area?\" Another man, a perfume salesman named Malik Farhan, noted in June 2009 that the device was attracted to his perfumes. \nFarhan said, \"They stop us every time. There's nothing we can do.\" Jasim Hussen, an Iraqi Police officer, said, \"The vast majority of the people we stop, it's because of their perfume.\" Another officer, Hasan Ouda, added, \"Most people now understand it's what gets them searched, so they don't use as much.\" McCormick said in email, \"cheaply manufactured perfumes and some cosmetics\" contain trace amounts of the explosive, RDX.\nOther police officers have been doubtful of the device. \"I didn\u2019t believe in this device in the first place. I was forced to use it by my superiors and I am still forced to do so,\" said one police officer who spoke anonymously to the New York Times because he was not authorized to speak. Another officer blamed corruption: \"Our government is to be blamed for all the thousands of innocent spirits who were lost since these devices have been used in Iraq.\"\nMcCormick still stands by the device, saying, \"I have tested it in practice and it works effectively and 100% reliably.\" McCormick also talked to the \"The Times\" of London saying, \"We have been dealing with doubters for ten years. One of the problems we have is that the machine does look a little primitive. We are working on a new model that has flashing lights.\" However, an associate of ATSC, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of possible retaliation, said, \"Everyone at ATSC knew there was nothing inside the ADE 651.\" "}

Other recommendations include refusing citizenship or residence permits to those who visibly show \"radical religious practice\". The report does not call for a complete ban, but it would place a number of restrictions on daily life for those who wished to carry on wearing a veil.\nAccording to the committee's report, \"The wearing of the full veil is a challenge to our republic. This is unacceptable.\" It added, \"We must condemn this excess\". It criticised the practice as being contrary to French principles of secularism and equality, and called for the French Parliament to adopt resolutions against the face veil. Bernard Accoyer, the President of the National Assembly, said that the veil was a \"symbol of the repression of women\", and of \"extremist fundamentalism\".\nThe report, which is nearly 200 pages long, has been produced after the committee took evidence for five months from religious leaders and human rights experts. The committee was told by Muslims that a law would increase feelings of alienation, even though the veil was not worn by the majority of Muslims. Earlier this year, the French President, Nicolas Sarkozy, said that veils were \"not welcome\" in France. Although he stopped short of calling for a ban, this would be the preferred option of about two-thirds of the French people, according to opinion polls.\nSome members of the committee favoured going further, but agreement could not be reached on a complete ban \"at this stage\", it was said. One member called this \"a missed opportunity\". An ban on covering the face when accessing public services would affect those using hospitals, schools, universities, post offices, and banks. Legislation in 2004 banned the wearing of head scarves and other religious symbols in French public schools.\nFrench government sources say that about 1,900 women in France wear an Islamic veil (mainly the niqab, which does not cover the eyes), out of about 5 million Muslims in the country \u2013 the largest Muslim population in Western Europe. Fears have been expressed that a ban would make France a terrorist target, even if it could be implemented. The Socialist opposition party, on the whole, is against a ban on principle, and has concerns that such a move would unfairly single out Muslim women."}

This is mainly used by American troops which train Afghan security forces.\nCamp Phoenix is often attacked by insurgents, particularly suicide bombers. In mid-November, an attack in Camp Phoenix, injured 25 people, half of them American soldiers.\nThe Taliban was the group that claimed responsibility for the attack. A spokesperson for the bombers, Zabihullah Mujahid, claimed in a telephone interview that the bomber had allegedly \"killed and wounded\" ten American soldiers and demolished three military vehicles.\nAsked about that claim, an American military spokeswoman, Air Force Master Sgt. Sabrina D. Foster, said that a statement would be issued soon but that in the meantime she could confirm only eight United States personnel with minor wounds. According to Kabul police chief Abdul Rahman, three of those injured were American interpreters.\nSayed Abdul Ghafar, head of the criminal investigation, Kabul police, said the explosion demolished at least eleven civilian vehicles in the adjoining area. Eight were wounded, most of whom were day laborers who generally would be leaving the base after a day's work. All were reported to be stable by Interior Ministry spokesman, Zemary Bashary.\n\"The target of the suicide attacker seemed to be foreign forces, but we couldn\u2019t see any American vehicle damaged there because the road was blocked by American forces. We don\u2019t know exactly the casualties among the foreign forces,\" said Ghafar.\nThe American troops soon blocked the area, and barred access to the highway. \"They won\u2019t even let the Afghan National Police near it,\" said an Afghan policeman near the place where the attack occurred.\nIt was the first suicide bombing in Kabul since January 18. In the previous attack, several bombs had been detonated by the attackers, who also fought with Afghan commandos. The situation was brought under control soon; however five people were killed. Earlier today, Afghan intelligence officials provided another statement about this attack; this statement is probably the one with most details.\nDuring a news conference, they showed a video which was about an Afghan man arrested for allegedly assisting in the attack. In the video, the man, named Kamaluddin, claimed that he received his orders from the Haqqani network. The latter is a militant organization based in Pakistan's tribal area. He calmly clarified that he had housed the seven attackers before the attack and had provided them with several weapons."}

This is the first time that Wood has publicly expressed an opinion on the war.\nWood advised Straw, then Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, that invading Iraq without the backing of the United Nations Security Council in the form of a specific mandate\u2014which the resolution the government used to support the war lacked\u2014would \"amount to the crime of aggression\", to which Straw responded that he was being \"dogmatic and international law was pretty vague\". Wood disputes this, saying, \"Obviously there are some areas of international law that can be quite uncertain. This, however, turned exclusively on the interpretation of a specific text and it is one on which I think that international law was pretty clear.\" \nHe says that it was unprecedented for the government to ignore his advice, and told the inquiry that he \"considered that the use of force against Iraq in March 2003 was contrary to international law,\" since the Security Council had not met to approve the use of force, nor to agree that Iraq was committing a \"material breach\" of existing disarmament resolutions. He believed that regime change was the reason for the British interest in the nation, and that it was not a valid reason for war. He told the inquiry, \"I made it clear that, in my view, the draft that they were working toward did not authorize the use of force without a further decision of the Security Council\". Recently declassified letters prove that Wood raised these concerns directly with Jack Straw. \nIn one of these letters, dated January 24, 2003, Wood said that the \"UK cannot lawfully use force in Iraq in ensuring compliance\" with UN resolutions (including resolution 1441, which gave Saddam Hussein a \"final opportunity\" to comply with the UN's mandates on weapons of mass destruction by November 2002). In his reply, Straw \"noted\", but \"did not accept\" Wood's advice. Straw said he was \"as committed as anyone to international law and its obligations\". He also said that \"it is an uncertain field. In this case, the issue is an arguable one, capable of honestly and reasonably held differences of view.\" He said he wanted a new UN resolution \"for political reasons\", but said that there was a \"strong case\" that existing resolutions would \"provide a sufficient basis in international law to justify military action\".\nInstead of following Wood's advice, government ministers used the advice of Lord Goldsmith, who was then the Attorney General for England and Wales. Goldsmith\u2014who is scheduled to appear before the Inquiry this Wednesday\u2014advised Straw that a second UN resolution would not be required to invade, based on a series of UN resolutions reaching back to the end of the Gulf War, despite having told the prime minister\u2014only then days before\u2014to wait for another UN resolution, the passing of which they had pushed other Security Council members for in the weeks running up to the invasion. Wood makes it clear, however, that the final decision regarding the legality of war lay with the Attorney General, rather than with himself.\nThe inquiry, chaired by Sir John Chilcot, was told that there were concerns about how the decision was made among the Foreign Office's senior legal advisors. Elizabeth Wilmshurst, then Deputy Legal Adviser to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, resigned in protest only days before the invasion. She criticised the decision-making process for its lack of transparency, and called it \"lamentable\". She also called the fact that Goldsmith gave his opinion only days before the invasion \"extraordinary\".\nWood said that Straw had \"often been advised things were unlawful and gone ahead anyway and won in the courts\" when he was home secretary. Last week, Straw\u2014when questioned by the inquiry\u2014called the decision to support the war a \"profoundly difficult political and moral dilemma\", and said it was the \"most difficult\" decision of his entire career. Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesman Ed Davey called Wood's statement \"the final nail in the coffin of the case for a legal war.\" He asks if the advice reached then prime minister Tony Blair or Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown, \"And if not, why not?\"\nWood's statement is expected to cause problems for Tony Blair when he appears before the inquiry on Friday. The war has provoked protests, and much outrage among politicians who believe that Blair was wrong to support then United States President George W. Bush by sending 45,000 British soldiers\u2014179 of whom died in combat\u2014to fight in Iraq. The Prime Minister at the time, Tony Blair, is due to appear before the inquiry on Friday, and Gordon Brown, the current prime minister, is scheduled before the general election (which is expected to occur in May). Brown said yesterday that he \"think[s] the mistake in the war was not to do the reconstruction and plan it in the way that was necessary so that Iraq could recover quickly after Saddam Hussein fell,\" and is expected to come under fire from the inquiry, which he himself set up, for his role in the war."}

He said that the aircraft turned opposite the heading indicated by controllers.\nAll ninety people aboard Flight ET409, which was headed to Addis Ababa, the capital of Ethiopia, were feared dead. The jet reportedly went down in fire at around 02.30 local time, disappearing from radar screens after leaving the airport.\n\"They asked him to correct his path but he did a very fast and strange turn before disappearing completely from the radar,\" commented Transportation Minister Ghazi Aridi. He added: \"Nobody is saying the pilot is to blame for not heeding orders. There could have been many reasons for what happened.

We do not know what happened or whether it was beyond the pilot's control.\"\nEthiopian Airlines' CEO, Girma Wake, however, countered Aridi's comments, saying that it is too soon to draw any conclusions. \"Rushing remarks, I don't think that helps anybody,\" he said in the Ethiopian capital.\nLebanese officials, meanwhile, have ruled out foul play as being the cause of the aircraft's crashing. The Associated Press quoted Ethiopian Airlines as saying that the pilot in control of the downed plane had twenty years of experience, although it did not disclose his name.\nAccording to an unnamed aviation analyst, Lebanon controllers were directing the Ethiopian flight for the first two to three minutes of the flight due to the thunderstorms, and noted that this was standard procedure during inclement weather.\nUS-based airline pilot Patrick Smith remarked that the plane could have crashed for many reasons. \"Had the plane encountered extreme turbulence, or had it suffered a powerful lightning strike that knocked out instruments while penetrating strong turbulence, then structural failure or loss of control, followed by an in-flight breakup, are possible causes.\""}

However, one academic who gave evidence to the committee says that the proposals, if implemented in full, would cost about \u00a35 billion (more than US$8 billion), and it is unclear whether this level of public finance will be available.\nThe Enterprise and Learning Committee made a number of recommendations to improve the rail service within Wales, and between Wales and England. It calls for better links between the north and south of Wales, high-speed links from Wales to other parts of the UK, and light rail systems for the southern cities of Cardiff, Swansea and Newport.\nOther suggestions include upgrading the Severn Tunnel between south Wales and England, electrifying the line along the north Wales coast, and new carriages, especially on routes serving the valleys of south Wales. Improved access for passengers with disability is another area where the committee wants action. It also calls for more decision-making powers about railway matters to be transferred to the devolved government in Wales.\nThe committee, which took two months to look over the report, said that it was concerned that passenger satisfaction with the service was lower in Wales than elsewhere. In addition, investment was needed to meet an anticipated increase in demand for passenger and freight services. It wants the possibility of reopening closed lines, or building new lines, to be examined.\nCommittee chairman Gareth Jones said that the report \"examines the long-term future of the rail network in Wales\", adding, \"The evidence we have gathered indicates that freight and passenger traffic on our network will increase over the coming years. The objective hopefully will be that Wales benefits from this extra traffic so that we are better placed in terms of high speed link connections with the rest of the UK and Europe. It is important that the Welsh government provides for that extra demand.\"\nCommenting on the report, Profesor Stuart Cole from the University of Glamorgan said that although the plans were ambitious, the committee had \"set out very clearly what is required if you\u2019re going to get a 21st century railway\". The 21 recommendations would cost \u00a35bn in total, with the three light rail schemes taking about one-third of that total, in his view. \nOther improvements, for example between the north and south of Wales, could be achieved at a lesser price. Cole, who gave evidence to the committee, says that \"for an expenditure of \u00a350m spread over three years we could get the journey time from Llandudno to Cardiff down from four hours to three hours and 20 minutes.\u201d\nThe Welsh Assembly Government will give its full response to the report at a later date. A spokesman said that a modern railway was \"crucial\" for Wales, and commented that the Assembly Government agreed with many of the recommendations. Network Rail, which manages railway tracks in Wales and elsewhere in Great Britain, said that it would already be spending more than \u00a31.5bn on infrastructure over the next five years, with improvements to over 120 stations planned."}

McDonald's said that this made the meal a cheeseburger, not a hamburger, and so she was sacked for not charging extra for the cheese.

Their paper is published today in the journal \"Geophysical Research Letters\".\nThe group studied twenty years of records of global weather conditions and wind speeds. They say that beneath the ozone hole, wind speeds are increased, which whips up more sea spray. Salt from this is carried upwards and makes the clouds brighter, reflecting more of the Sun's radiation. This helps cool the Earth, counteracting the effects of global warming.\nThe ozone layer in the atmosphere protects life from the harmful effects of ultraviolet radiation, and the discovery of its rapid depletion in the 1980s caused widespread alarm. The Montreal Protocol adopted in 1987 forced countries to phase out chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), the man-made chemicals thought to be largely responsible for the hole.\nProfessor Ken Carslaw, of the University of Leeds School of Earth and Environment, was one of the co-authors of the paper. He warned that as the ozone hole healed, warming in parts of the Southern Hemisphere could accelerate. \n\"If, as seems likely, these winds die down, rising CO2 emissions could then cause the warming of the southern hemisphere to accelerate, which would have an impact on future climate predictions,\" he said\nDescribing the findings as \"unexpected and complex climate feedback\", Professor Carslaw emphasised that this research was not a reason to try and keep the hole open:\n\"You can't correct two wrongs in that way. The ozone hole was potentially a major catastrophe for the planet that was only stopped by the Montreal Protocol, so we can't go back on that.\"\nHe said instead that carbon emissions should be cut drastically.\nThe research was funded by the Natural Environment Research Council and the Academy of Finland Centre of Excellence Programme.\nJudith Perlwitz, a resercher at the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, said that the group's data were sound but she disagreed with some of the paper's conclusions. Perlwitz claimed that rising temperatures due to global warming would increase wind speeds anyway, leading to the same effects as the ozone hole.\n\u201cThe question is whether the wind is really going to slow down, and that I doubt,\u201d she said.\nAccording to a World Meteorological Organization report in 2006, it is likely to be at least fifty years before the ozone above Antarctica is back to its pre-1980 state."}

His testimony comes only a day after former foreign office legal advisor Michael Wood told the inquiry that his own advice, that a further resolution was required, was ignored in favour of Goldsmith's. Goldsmith's account was under scrutiny because he had consistently said that it would be \"safer\" if a further resolution were obtained\u2014since it would have put the \"matter beyond doubt and nobody could have challenged the legality\"\u2014before changing his mind and giving the \"green light\" only a month before the invasion. He said that he had \"good reasons\" for \"ultimately reach[ing] a different view\", and called his previous advice \"too cautious\". He based his support of the war's legality on a series of UN resolutions dating back to the end of the Gulf War.\nUntil February 2002, he believed that a new resolution would be required, but he said today that\u2014after discussions with US and UK diplomats\u2014he realised that United Nations Security Council Resolution 1441 \"revive[d]\" the authority of the United Kingdom to use force, as outlined in previous resolutions. One of these was United Nations Security Council Resolution 678, which was passed in November 1990. It authorized \"Member States co-operating with the Government of Kuwait ... to use all necessary means to uphold and implement resolution 660 (1990) and all subsequent relevant resolutions and to restore international peace and security in the area\" against Iraq if Saddam Hussein failed to give up his weapons of mass destruction. However, there has been debate about whether \"all means necessary\" included military force.\nHe admitted that he had told then prime minister Tony Blair, as far back as 2002, that any justification for war other than a UN resolution (such as regime change or self defence) would be invalid. Goldsmith said, \"I don't think it [the advice] was terribly welcome.\" However, he added, \"The prime minister made it clear that he accepted that it was for me to reach a judgement and he had to accept it.\" Goldsmith agreed that he ignored the advice of other legal advisors, including Michael Wood (who spoke before the inquiry yesterday) and Elizabeth Wilmshurst (who resigned in protest days before the invasion), who both said that invading Iraq without a new UN resolution would amount to the \"crime of aggression\". Goldsmith claimed to have \"paid great attention to what their views were,\" but added, \"Ultimately I disagreed with the views they took.\"\nHe said that an \"unequivocal\" opinion was needed before the invasion, and that this was what he gave in March, having been unsure about the war's legality previously. He denied changing his mind only days before the invasion, as some have claimed, saying that he had advised the government that the war would be legal as far back as February, and that his advice was \"consistent\". He also called claims that he was pressured into changing his opinion \"nonsense\". He said that he \"was ready to answer questions\" and intended to debate the issue with the cabinet, but was told that they would read his advice before moving on to different issues. He said that the debate did not in fact take place \u2013 he told the inquiry that he believes cabinet ministers considered it to be \"a slightly sterile exercise\".\nIn his testimony, Goldsmith also criticised Jack Straw's response to Wood's advice, saying that, while ministers could \"challenge\" legal advice, Straw \"appeared to be rebuking a senior legal adviser for expressing his own legal view\" in a recently declassified letter. He was also concerned that the cabinet ignored, or was unaware of, the caveats included in his March advice on the war's legality, in which he said that \"the safest legal course\" would be to get a new resolution, despite a \"reasonable case\" being available based on existing resolutions. His advice warned the government that he was not \"confident\" that the case based on existing resolutions would stand up in court. Goldsmith also requested the declassification of documents relating to the war's legal status, which are available to the Iraq inquiry, but not to the public. Sir John Chilcot, the chair of the inquiry, said that Goldsmith's \"frustration is shared.\""}

No agreement has yet been reached, and the main parties have been given two more days to attempt to broker a deal.\nMartin McGuinness, the deputy first minister and member of the republican party Sinn F\u00e9in, was \"deeply disappointed\" by the lack of an agreement on the possible devolution of Northern Ireland's policing and justice powers from Westminster, London to Stormont, Belfast. Brown, however, believes the discussions are salvageable. He said that there is the \"prospect of a reasonable agreement\" being reached within the next two days, and that they \"have the pathway to an agreement\" in place. The British unionist Democratic Unionist Party and Sinn F\u00e9in\u2014Northern Ireland's two largest parties\u2014have been arguing over the issue for some time.\nOn Monday, Brown and Cowen travelled to Hillsborough Castle to meet with delegates of Northern Ireland's major parties in an attempt to forge an agreement, and\u2014before he left\u2014Brown gave the remaining delegates 48 hours to find a mutually beneficial solution. He said that the governments of the UK and Ireland will publish their plans if no such agreement is reached. He also said that the devolution could occur \"around the beginning of May\" this year. Sinn F\u00e9in want the devolution to occur as soon as possible, but the DUP argues that \"community confidence\" is required before the process, which would give Northern Ireland its first justice minister, can begin.\nMcGuinness said, \"We have not concluded a deal today and I am deeply disappointed about that. We intend to study the governments' statement.\" He said that his party would refuse to give its support to anything that subjected \"citizens' rights\" to a \"unionist veto\". Peter Robinson, the leader of the DUP who has been forced to temporarily stand aside as first minister due to a sexual and financial scandal involving his wife, said that his party would not accept a \"second-rate deal\" in order to keep to \"someone else's time limit\". He is also reported as saying, \"We are not prepared to buy a pig in a poke. We will do what is right for our community.\" Sinn F\u00e9in has accused the DUP of stalling for time, though Robinson denied this, saying that \"[t]he party has always wanted to see the devolution of policing and justice and has always wanted it to happen without undue delay but it has to happen on a basis that we believe is sustainable\".\nIt is thought that a failure to come to an agreement could trigger a re-election in the Northern Ireland Assembly, and damage the delicate peace process, which began with the Good Friday Agreement of 1998. Margaret O'Callaghan, of Queen's University Belfast said, \"It's difficult to overestimate just how bad relations are between them. They really do not get on. On the other hand people have too much invested in this to allow it to collapse.\""}

He was then jailed by court order, and US officials have been given forty days to give evidence to back up the requested extradition.\nThe day preceding the arrest, a New York court indicted the former president on charges of embezzling millions of dollars worth of public funds in 2000-2004, when he was in office.

Delegates present at the conference were from twenty countries, including Yemen, the United Kingdom, and the United States. \nThe conference was called by British Prime Minister Gordon Brown due to the failed Christmas Day plot to blow up a US plane, for which al-Qaeda in Yemen claimed responsibility. However, the attendees stress that the al-Qaeda presence is not Yemen's only problem, and that it cannot be solved without first dealing with the others.\nHillary Clinton, the US Secretary of State, said that bringing peace to Yemen and making it more stable is a major priority for the United States. She said that the United States had signed a three-year agreement on security development in Yemen. \"To help the people of Yemen, we\u2014the international community\u2014can and must do more. And so must the Yemeni government,\" she said. \nClinton said that she does not believe that military action would be enough to solve Yemen's problems, and that corruption must be combated as well as building up democratic institutions and promoting human rights. She asked that the government of Yemen begin its proposed ten-point program for the development of these areas and to reduce the influence of extremist organisations.\nYemen is the poorest nation in the Arab world, and its economy was also on the meeting's agenda. The United Kingdom's Foreign Secretary David Miliband chaired the talks, and said that the Yemeni government had pledged to begin an attempt to combat this by entering into discussions with the International Monetary Fund, representatives of which were present at the conference, in order to put together a plan for its economy. \nMiliband also announced that a \"Friends of Yemen\" organisation was to be launched, to discuss the economy, government, and judicial process of Yemen. Also present were delegates from the United Nations, European Union, and World Bank. Miliband acknowledged that the solution was not simply a military one by saying at a press conference, \"It's been a common feature of every contribution that we have heard today that the assault on Yemen's problems cannot begin and end with its security challenges and its counter-terrorism strategy. In tackling terrorism it is vital to tackle its root causes. In Yemen's case these are manifold\u2014economic, social and political\".\n, the Prime Minister of Yemen, received this support warmly, but said that any attack on the nation's sovereignty would be considered \"unacceptable\", and that it should not be portrayed as a failing nation, despite a multitude of problems, including its damaged economy, rapidly growing population, and shrinking oil reserves, as well as the beginning of a drought and its problems with insurgents, such as al-Qaeda terrorists. British Foreign Office Minister echoed Mujawar's statements by saying that Yemen is \"not a failed state\", but \"an incredibly fragile state\". Lewis also said that \"[s]upporting the government of Yemen is crucial to the stability of that country but it is also crucial to the stability of the world\".\nYemen's Foreign Minister, Abu Bakr al-Qirbi, asked the delegates at the conference for \"international support to build infrastructure, combat poverty and create jobs, as well as support in combating terrorism\". However, he said that the idea of having US military bases in Yemen was \"inconceivable\".\n secretary general is unsure how useful the meeting will be. He expressed these concerns by telling the BBC, \"I don't know how a conference like that can decide something useful, something reasonable for Yemen... in a couple of hours\", and saying that it was a \"strange\" and \"very unusual sign\" that the Arab League had not been given the chance to send delegates to the conference, despite wanting to discuss all of Yemen's problems without specific focus on al-Qaeda. Despite these concerns, donors from a number of Western and Gulf nations have agreed to meed again, this time in the Saudi Arabian capital city of , in February."}

The group estimated that the airline industry lost a total of US$11 billion in 2009 last year, and will lose another $5.6 billion in 2010.\nAirlines in Africa had the biggest passenger demand drop, at 6.8%; North American airlines and Asian carriers had demand go down 5.8%. European airlines saw a drop of 5%. Middle Eastern and Latin American carriers, however, had rises in demand, with gains of 11.3% and 0.3%, respectively. According to the Agence France-Presse news agency, part of the reason Middle Eastern carriers performed better is because of their position between Asia, Africa, and Europe, resulting in more connecting flights through hubs.\n\"While both North American and European carriers saw demand improvements in the first half of the year, the second half was basically flat,\" said IATA.\nIATA represents 230 airlines, accounting for 90% of scheduled air traffic, although some budget carriers are not included.\nThe IATA boss said that, although the worst appeared to be over due to the global economic recovery airlines would have to keep their costs low. \"Revenue improvements will be at a much slower pace than the demand growth that we are starting to see,\" he noted.\n\"Profitability will be even slower to recover and airlines will lose an expected 5.6 billion dollars in 2010. The industry starts 2010 with some enormous challenges. The worst is behind us, but it's not time to celebrate. Adjusting to 2.5 to 3.5 years of lost growth means that airlines face another spartan year, focused on matching capacity carefully to demand and controlling costs,\" Bisignani continued.\nCosts for security were also an issue. Bisignani said: \"Governments and industry are aligned in the priority that we place on security. But the cost of security is also an issue. Globally, airlines spend US$5.9 billion a year on what are essentially measures concerned with national security. This is the responsibility of governments, and they should be picking up the bill.\" \nAnalysts, however, say that cost cutting measures, intended to attract more customers, would also harm airline profits. Saj Ahmad, an independent airline analyst, commented: \"Continued fare wars between airlines mean that yields and profitability will be low. Airlines are struggling to fill their airplanes and discounted ticketing has done little to alleviate the pressures on their costs,\" as quoted by the BBC.\n\"Capacity has come out of the global airline system, but until a few airlines perhaps exit the industry through bankruptcy or mergers, there is still a very long road until we see serious stability, let alone growth,\" Ahmad added."}

But he said change is not easy, and he will continue to pursue it. \"We do not quit. I do not quit. Let us seize this moment-to start anew, to carry the dream forward, and to strengthen our union once more,\" he said.\nIn his hour-long speech before both houses of the United States Congress, the president several times confronted the public anger that has caused his approval ratings to slide. \"We have to recognize that we face more than a deficit of dollars right now. We face a deficit of trust-deep and corrosive doubts about how Washington works that have been growing for years,\" he said.\nMuch of Americans' frustration concerns the nation's stubborn 10-percent unemployment rate. Obama called for a number of initiatives to address the problem and urged the Senate to join the House of Representatives in passing a second jobs bill. \"People are out of work. They are hurting. They need our help. And, I want a jobs bill on my desk without delay,\" he said.\nAmong the president's economic goals are doubling U.S. exports in five years and freezing most domestic government spending for three years, starting in 2011. Obama also called upon lawmakers to continue earmark reform, saying, \"Tonight, I'm calling on Congress to publish all earmark requests on a single Web site before there's a vote, so that the American people can see how their money is being spent.\"\nObama urged Democratic lawmakers not to abandon the effort to reform the U.S. health care system, one of his administration's main priorities. \"Do not walk away from reform. Not now. Not when we are so close. Let us find a way to come together and finish the job for the American people,\" he said.\nHe called on both Democrats and Republicans to overcome their bitter partisan divisions and work together to pass legislation to solve problems. \"What frustrates the American people is a Washington where every day is Election Day,\" he said. \"We cannot wage a perpetual campaign where the only goal is to see who can get the most embarrassing headlines about the other side. A belief 'if you lose, I win.'\"\nOn foreign policy, President Obama again pledged to remove all U.S. combat troops from Iraq by the end of August. \"But make no mistake: this war is ending, and all of our troops are coming home,\" Obama said.\nHe also said he is confident the United States will succeed in the war in Afghanistan and that diplomatic efforts are helping isolate Iran and North Korea for their pursuit of nuclear weapons. He also addressed critics of his foreign policy agenda, such as former Vice President Dick Cheney saying, \"Let's put aside the schoolyard taunts about who is tough. Let's reject the false choice between protecting our people and upholding our values.\" \nAnother plan announced by Obama is to end the U.S. military's controversial \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy on sexual orientation of service members that has existed since the Clinton administration saying, \"This year, I will work with Congress and our military to finally repeal the law that denies gay Americans the right to serve the country they love because of who they are.\" He added, \"It's the right thing to do.\"\nObama also addressed the recent ruling by the Supreme Court of the United States in \"Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission\" saying, \"With all due deference to separation of powers, last week the Supreme Court reversed a century of law that I believe will open the floodgates for special interests \u2013 including foreign corporations \u2013 to spend without limit in our elections.\" In a break of decorum, Associate Justice Samuel Alito appeared to mouth the words, \"No, not true\", in response, according to many commentators.\nThe Republican Party's response to the president's speech came from the governor of the state of Virginia, Bob McDonnell. McDonnell gave the speech from the chamber of the Virginia House of Delegates. He said Democrats are spending too much and causing an unsustainable level of debt. \nThe newly inaugurated governor said, \"What government should not do is pile on more taxation, regulation and litigation that kill jobs and hurt the middle class.\"\nHe also said Americans want affordable health care, but do not want the government to run it.\nMcDonnell also criticized the Obama administration's handling of the suspect accused of trying to blow up Northwest Airlines Flight 253 on Christmas Day. He said he does not agree with the decision to try the Nigerian suspect, Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab in the Detroit airliner plot in a U.S. civilian court.\nMcDonnell is one of several Republicans who have recently won elections in states which the Democrats swept in 2008."}

They were convicted of being \"Mohareb\", or \"enemies of God\". They were also charged as being members of a banned monarchist group, the Kingdom Assembly or the Mujahedin Khalq. Prosecutors also claimed that Zamani had met with American forces in Iraq and discussed returning to Iran to carry out political assassinations.\nSome media reports have suggested the men were actually executed over last year's election protests. Rahmanipour's lawyer, Nasrin Sotoudeh, clarified that her client played no role in the June election unrest, pointing out to Agence France-Presse that \"he was arrested in [March\u2013April] before the election and charged with co-operation with the [monarchist] Kingdom Assembly\". She added that he had confessed because of \"threats against his family,\" adding that many of the charges were filed against him while he was a minor \u2014 he is now nineteen. Sotoudeh described the trial as being a \"show trial\", and commented that she hadn't been allowed to represent him in court. \nAfter the June election, which was widely disputed, there were several weeks of demonstrations and protests, which saw 4,000 people arrested by the authorities in a crackdown, among them journalists and reformist politicians. Several million people attended the protests, demanding a re-vote. Opposition groups asserted that the elections were rigged to favour president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, but the government denied it, saying it was a foreign-backed attempt to discredit the Iranian government system."}

He faced six hours of questioning, starting at 6:30 am, at the Queen Elizabeth II Conference Centre in London concerning his role in the 2003 Iraq invasion. During the inquiry, Blair stood by his decision to invade, saying he would make the same decision again.\nThis is the third time Blair has given evidence at an inquiry into the Iraq War, having already testified before the Hutton Inquiry and the Butler Review, as well as participating in an investigation by the Intelligence and Security Committee. The Hutton Inquiry found that the government did not \"sex up\" the dossier on Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. The Butler Review uncovered \"serious flaws\" in pre-war intelligence, and this inquiry was set up by current prime minister Gordon Brown in order to \"learn the lessons\" of the war. Sir John Chilcott, the inquiry chairman, began by stressing that Blair was not \"on trial\", but could be called back to give further evidence if necessary.\nAt the end of the session, Chilcott asked Blair if he had any regrets, to which Blair replied that he was \"sorry\" that it was \"divisive\", but said that invading was the right thing to do since he believes \"the world is a safer place as a result.\" Blair said that the inquiry should ask the \"2010 question\", which refers to the hypothetical position that the world would be in if Saddam Hussein were not removed from power. He said that \"today we would have a situation where Iraq was competing with Iran [...] in respect of support of terrorist groups\".\nReasons for invasion.\nAt the inquiry, the topics on which Blair was questioned included his reasons for invading Iraq.\nAt the time, he said that his reasons were based on a need to rid Iraq of weapons of mass destruction; however, interviews held later suggest that removing Saddam Hussein from power was his primary objective. Blair denies this, asserting that the need to dispose of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction was the only reason for the United Kingdom's participation in the invasion. He explained that, in an interview with Fern Britton, he \"did not use the words regime change\", and, what he was trying to say was, \"you would not describe the nature of the threat in the same way if you knew then what you knew now, that the intelligence on WMD had been shown to be wrong\".\nHe said, despite no weapons of mass destruction being found by UN weapons inspectors, he still believes that Saddam Hussein had the means to develop and deploy them; \"[h]e had used them, he definitely had them [...] and so in a sense it would have required quite strong evidence the other way to be doubting the fact that he had this programme [...] The primary consideration for me was to send an absolutely powerful, clear and unremitting message that after September 11 if you were a regime engaged in WMD [weapons of mass destruction], you had to stop.\"\nHe also said that weapons of mass destruction and regime change were not separate issues, but \"conjoined\", since \"brutal and oppressive\" regimes with such weapons are a \"bigger threat\" than less hostile nations with the same weapons. He said that Hussein's regime was hiding important information from UN weapons inspectors, and had \"no intention\" of complying with them. He asserted that he has \"no regrets\" about removing Hussein, \"[a] monster and I believe he threatened not just the region but the world.\"\nThere were also questions about why the UN weapons inspectors were not given more time in Iraq in March 2003. Blair responded by saying that it would have made very little difference, as Iraq had the knowledge and \"intent\" to rebuild its weapons program from scratch if it were dismantled. He was also asked whether he still believed that the war was morally justified. He said that he did. He also said that the war was required because more diplomatic solutions had already failed, and the \"containment\" of Hussein's regime through diplomatic sanctions was \"eroding\" when the decision to invade was made.\nHe also said that attitudes towards Saddam Hussein and the threat he presented \"changed dramatically\" after the 9/11 attacks on the World Trade Centre in New York. He said, \"I never regarded 11 September as an attack on America, I regarded it as an attack on us.\" He said that he believed terrorists would use biological and chemical weaponry, and also said, \"if those people inspired by this religious fanaticism could have killed 30,000 they would have. My view was you could not take risks with this issue at all.\"\nHe later said, \"When I talked earlier about the calculus of risk changing after September 11 it's really important I think to understand in so far as to understanding the decision I took, and frankly would take again. If there was any possibility that he could develop weapons of mass destruction we should stop him. That was my view then. It's my view now.\"\nCrawford commitment.\nHe was also asked about his supposed commitment to George W. Bush that United Kingdom would join the United States in an Iraq war, which he is said to have made at Bush's Crawford ranch in 2002. Blair stubbornly denied that this took place, saying that what was said is that Saddam Hussein had to be \"dealt with\", and that \"the method of doing that is open\". Instead, he says, his reasons for the invasion were moral.\nHe also said, \"This isn't about a lie or a conspiracy or a deceit or a deception. It's a decision. And the decision I had to take was, given Saddam's history, given his use of chemical weapons, given the over one million people whose deaths he had caused, given 10 years of breaking UN resolutions, could we take the risk of this man reconstituting his weapons programmes or is that a risk that it would be irresponsible to take?\"\nHe said of Bush: \"I think what he took from that [the meeting] was exactly what he should have taken, which was if it came to military action because there was no way of dealing with this diplomatically, we would be with him.\" He did admit, however, that\u2014a year later, as the invasion approached\u2014he had been offered a \"way out\" of the war, which he declined. He said of this, \"I think President Bush at one point said, before the [House of Commons] debate, 'Look if it's too difficult for Britain, we understand'. I took the view very strongly then\u2014and do now\u2014that it was right for us to be with America, since we believed in this too.\"\nThe 45-minute claim.\nAnother line of questioning focused on his 45-minute claim, which was included in the September 2002 dossier but redacted after the war. It states that Hussein was able to deploy nuclear weapons within 45 minutes of giving the order. This dossier also contained the words, \"the assessed intelligence has established beyond doubt is that Saddam has continued to produce chemical and biological weapons\". However, the inquiry has revealed that there were certain caveats involved, so the claim was not\u2014anti-war campaigners claim\u2014\"beyond doubt\", especially since senior civil servants have told the inquiry that intelligence suggested that Hussein's weapons of mass destruction had been dismantled.\nBlair said that it \"would have been better if (newspaper) headlines about the '45-minute claim' had been corrected\" to state\u2014as he admits he should have made clear\u2014that the claim referred to battlefield munitions, rather than to missiles. He says that, with the benefit of hindsight, he would have liked to have published the intelligence reports themselves, since they were \"absolutely strong enough\". He did insist, however, that the intelligence that was available at the time put it \"beyond doubt\" that Iraq was continuing to develop weaponry. He added that \"things obviously look quite different\" after the war, since weapons of mass destruction were not found.\nLegality and planning.\nOne of the main topics was the legality of the war. Earlier this week, a senior Foreign Office legal advisor claimed that the war would be illegal without a further United Nations Security Council resolution\u2014which was not obtained. The attorney general at the time, Lord Peter Goldsmith, said that the cabinet refused to enter into a debate over the legality of the war, and that Blair had not received his advice that a further UN resolution would be needed warmly. He insists that he \"desperately\" tried to find a diplomatic solution to the problem until France and Russia \"changed their position\" and would not allow the passage of a further resolution.\nBlair also said that he would not have invaded had Goldsmith said that it \"could not be justified legally\", and explained Goldsmith's change of mind by saying that the then attorney general \"had to come to a conclusion\", and his conclusion was that the war was legal. He did not know why Goldsmith made this conclusion, but said he believes that it may be due to the fact that weapons inspectors \"indicated that Saddam Hussein had not taken a final opportunity to comply\" with the UN.\nQuestions were also asked on the government's poor post-war planning, and claimed confusion about whether the US had a plan for Iraq after the war was over. Blair was drilled about the lack of priority that was given to the issue of post-war planning. He was also asked about the lack of equipment that British soldiers were given. This line of questioning was pursued in front of the families of some of the soldiers who died in Iraq\u2014many of whom blame the poor equipment for the deaths of their relatives.\nResponse.\nThe families of some of the 179 British soldiers killed in the Iraq war, along with around 200 anti-war protesters, held a demonstration calling for Blair to be declared a war criminal outside the centre in London's City of Westminster. They chanted \"Tony Blair, war criminal\" as the former prime minister gave evidence inside. Blair was jeered by a member of the audience as he made his closing statement, and the families booed him, chanting \"you are a liar\" and \"you are a murderer\" as he left the centre.\nIn order to avoid the protesters, he arrived early and was escorted by security as he entered through the back door, with large numbers of police officers standing by. One of these protesters, Iraqi Saba Jaiwad, said, \"The Iraqi people are having to live every day with aggression, division, and atrocities. Blair should not be here giving his excuses for the illegal war, he should be taken to The Hague to face criminal charges because he has committed crimes against the Iraqi people.\"\nAhmed Rushdi, an Iraqi journalist, said that he was unsurprised by Blair's defence of the invasion, because, \"A liar is still a liar\". He also claimed that the war had done more harm than good, because, \"Before 2003 there were problems with security, infrastructure and services, and people died because of the sanctions, but after 2003 there are major disasters. Major blasts have killed about 2,000 people up till now. After six years or seven years there is no success on the ground, in any aspect.\"\nCurrent prime minister Gordon Brown, who set up the inquiry, said before Blair's appearance that it was not a cause for concern. Anthony Seldon, Blair's biographer, called the session \"a pivotal day for him [Blair], for the British public and for Britain's moral authority in the world\". Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg, who opposes the war, said in Friday's \"Daily Telegraph\" that it was \"a pivotal moment in answering a question millions of British people are still asking themselves: Why did we participate in an illegal invasion of another country?\" He called the invasion \"subservience-by-default to the White House\", and questioned the \"special relationship\" between between the United Kingdom and the United States.\nVincent Moss, the political editor of the \"Sunday Mirror\" newspaper, criticised the inquiry for being too soft on Blair. He said, \"A lot of ground wasn't covered, and in my mind it wasn't covered in enough detail, particularly the dodgy dossier in September 2002. There wasn't very much interrogation on that, they pretty much accepted what Tony Blair said about the intelligence. We could have had an awful lot stronger questioning on that\".\nIt is feared by some senior Labour Party politicians that today's events could ignite strong feelings about the issue in voters, and thereby damage the popularity of the party, which is already trailing behind the Conservative Party with a general election required in the first half of the year."}

In an interview with \"Wikinews\", the WHO tells about the current .\nThe organization's 93rd update as of March 26, 2010 states 213 countries, territories, and other communities have laboratory-confirmed cases and there have been at least 16,931 confirmed deaths, including 4,653 deaths in Europe and 7,673 in the Americas.\n\"Wikinews\" reporter talks with Karen Mah, a media relations representative for the WHO, and asks her several questions.\nInterview.\nCan you tell us what exactly H1N1 is and how it affects us today?\n As of 21 March 2010, worldwide more than 213 countries and overseas territories or communities have reported laboratory confirmed cases of pandemic influenza H1N1 2009, including over 16,931 deaths. This number is a large underestimation of total deaths with total figures unavailable until a year or two after the pandemic is declared over. \n How does the WHO feel the media coverage has been and does the WHO suggest any changes to coverage and if so, what kind?\n WHO does not have any comment with regards to media coverage nor is it in our purview to suggest changes to coverage. The pandemic is a global event and media coverage can't be characterized with any generalities. \n Which areas around the world are most affected by the pandemic and why?\n Current disease activity and epidemiological activity indicates we are seeing the highest levels of activities occurring in Southeast Asia, West Africa, and in the tropical zone of the Americas. After a period of sustained pandemic influenza transmission in Thailand over the past two months, overall activity now appears to be decreasing. In West Africa, limited data suggests that active transmission of pandemic influenza virus persists without clear evidence of a peak in activity. In Central America and in the tropical zone of South America, an increasing trend of respiratory disease activity associated with circulation of pandemic influenza virus has been reported since early March 2010 in an increasing number of countries. \n What advice does the WHO recommend to any areas affected by H1N1? What does the WHO recommend to governments' health authorities of countries affected?\n This is a very far-reaching question and answer and paraphrasing the pandemic preparedness guidelines is too simplistic. I will refer you to this page [URL below] to see the whole spectrum of guidance for countries ranging from response, surveillance, reduction of spread, travel, hygiene etc. From a WHO perspective, we have to offer the broadest range of guidance to cover developing, mid-level and developed countries.\nhttp://www.who.int/csr/disease/swineflu/guidance/national_authorities/en/index.html\n What does the WHO recommend for those individuals affected by H1N1? How does H1N1 affect someone who is infected?\n Since the H1N1 pandemic virus is now the dominant influenza virus circulating worldwide, most cases of influenza-like illness are likely pandemic influenza.\nTypical symptoms to watch for include fever, cough, headache, body aches, sore throat and runny nose.\nWHO advises health care providers to treat people with influenza-like illness based on their symptoms and the progress of their illness, and not to wait for laboratory confirmation of pandemic influenza. The pandemic H1N1 virus has already spread worldwide.\nRegarding laboratory testing of cases, public health authorities and WHO partners continue to do selective testing of samples from patients with influenza-like illness to characterize outbreaks, monitor the virus and identify disease trends.\n (which are medicines that act directly on viruses to stop them from multiplying) should not be taken to prevent H1N1. There are two antiviral drugs are being used to treat pandemic influenza infections. These are oseltamivir and zanamivir, which both block the action of an influenza virus protein called .\nFor patients with symptoms of severe illness that are probably due to pandemic influenza, WHO recommends that treatment with oseltamivir should start immediately, no matter when the illness started and without waiting for laboratory results to confirm infection.\nFor patients at higher risk for serious disease from pandemic influenza, including pregnant women, children under age 5 and those with certain underlying medical conditions, WHO recommends treatment with either oseltamivir or zanamivir as soon as possible after the onset of symptoms, and without waiting for the results of laboratory tests.\nOtherwise healthy people who are not from a higher risk group but who have persistent or rapidly worsening symptoms should be treated with antivirals. These symptoms include difficulty breathing or a high fever that lasts beyond three days.\n How does H1N1 affect someone who is infected?\n Pandemic H1N1 virus is spread from person to person in the same way that seasonal influenza viruses are spread. It is transmitted as easily as the normal seasonal flu and can be passed to other people by exposure to infected droplets expelled by coughing or sneezing that can be inhaled, or that can contaminate hands or surfaces.\nSigns of the pandemic influenza are flu-like, including , fever, cough, headache, muscle and joint pain, sore throat and runny nose, and sometimes vomiting and .\nThe majority of people with pandemic influenza experience mild illness and recover fully without treatment. However, people should seek medical care if they experience shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, or if a fever, and especially high fever, continues more than three days. For parents with a young child who is ill, seek medical care if a child has fast or labored breathing, continuing fever or convulsions (seizures).\nSupportive care at home with plenty of rest, drinking plenty of fluids and using a pain reliever for aches and pains is adequate for recovery in most cases. A non- pain reliever should be used for children or adolescents under age 18.\nThe public should be made aware that there are specific groups of people who appear to be at higher risk of more complicated or severe illness which include:\nCurrently, people age 65 or older are the least likely to be infected with the pandemic influenza, but those who do get sick are also at high risk of developing serious complications, just as they are from seasonal flu.\n Is it known when the virus will become less virulent and cease becoming a major threat to health and of so when?\n It is impossible to predict when the pandemic H1N1 virus will become less virulent.\n Is there a significant risk of H1N1 mutating and becoming more deadly?\n Influenza viruses constantly change through a process called . All influenza viruses undergo this process but there is no way to predict if, when and how the pandemic H1N1 virus will shift.\n Are the current anti-flu vaccines effective and how sufficient is the current supply? Can you explain how these anti-virus vaccine work and any possible side effects?\n The current H1N1 vaccines are effective and supply is sufficient. The safety profile of H1N1 vaccines is very good. Outcomes of studies completed to date indicate that pandemic vaccines have a similar safety record as seasonal influenza vaccines. Pandemic influenza vaccines underwent the same production and testing methods as seasonal vaccines.\nThe safety tracking of the vaccine for adverse events after its distribution and use worldwide has likely been the most thorough and sensitive in history.\nInfluenza vaccines cause antibodies to develop in the body. These antibodies provide protection against infection with the viruses that are in the vaccine.\nPossible side effects can depend on the type of vaccine, how it is administered and the age of the recipient.\nThere are two main types of vaccines: one is manufactured with inactivated viruses, the other uses live viruses.\nInactivated vaccines, administered by injection, commonly cause local reactions such as soreness, swelling and redness at the injection site, and less often can cause fever, muscle- or joint- aches or headache. These symptoms are generally mild, do not need medical attention, and last 1 to 2 days. Fever, aches and headaches can occur more frequently in children compared to elderly people.\nRarely, such influenza vaccines can cause allergic reactions such as hives, rapid swelling of deeper skin layers and tissues, asthma or a severe multisystem allergic reaction due to hypersensitivity to certain vaccine components.\nLive vaccines are given via a nasal spray, and can commonly cause runny nose, nasal congestion, cough, and can less frequently cause sore throat, low grade fever, irritability and head- and muscle- aches. Wheezing and vomiting episodes have been described in children receiving live influenza vaccines.\nWhat action has the WHO taken, if any, to insure vaccines are available?\n During the first stages of the pandemic in 2009, the Director-General highlighted the need to make vaccine and medicines available to countries who would be unable to access them on their own. As the WHO pandemic vaccine donation programme was first established, all countries were surveyed by WHO, and 95 identified as having no access to pandemic vaccines, and therefore eligible for donations.\nBased on the pledges of donated vaccine, a plan was prepared for a two phase approach to supply sufficient vaccines for 10% of the population in these countries; an initial supply to cover health workers and other essential workers, equivalent to 2% of the population, and a second supply of 8% for other priority groups. The sequencing of supply was based on assessments of vulnerability to the pandemic, and readiness to utilize vaccines.\nTo date, 25 countries have received donated H1N1 vaccine totaling more than 10 million doses, along with ancillary supplies. Another 15 to 20 countries will be receiving their vaccine shipments in the upcoming few weeks. \nThe 25 countries who have received shipments are: Azerbaijan, Afghanistan, Cambodia, Fiji, Kiribati, Kosovo, Laos PDR, Maldives, Mongolia, Nauru, Nicaragua, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, Togo, Tonga, Vanuatu, Cuba, Honduras, El Salvador, Kenya, Samoa, Tokelau, Cook Islands, Pakistan, [and] Philippines\nLast November, the WHO stated the H1N1 virus is world's most dominant virus. Is this still true?\n On February 18th, WHO concluded a four-day meeting to look at vaccine strains for seasonal influenza vaccine for the 2010 and 2011 season. This is part of the routine work that WHO does twice yearly to determine vaccine strains to be included in upcoming northern and southern hemisphere seasonal influenza vaccines.\nDuring the scientific discussions which ended on the 18th of February, it was confirmed that the overwhelming number of influenza viruses that were isolated around the world were the pandemic H1N1 virus. The experts believe that based on this information that this virus will continue to be one of the dominant viruses in wide circulation in the coming fall and winter season.\nIs there anything that the WHO believes to be very important for the public to know about the H1N1?\n Thank you for your time."}

The acting head of the UN's Haitian mission, meanwhile, says that that full reconstruction could take several decades. As many as 200,000 people were killed by the tremors, which struck on January 12, and 1.5 million people have been left without homes.\nAnthony Banbury, the deputy head of the UN mission in the earthquake-ravaged country, commented to the Agence France-Presse (AFP) news agency that survivors queuing for aid sometimes turned violent. He commented that while the aid is vital for the country, \"it can be a source of insecurity because it attracts big crowds and there can be disorder around food distribution.\"\n\"[It is] absolutely necessary that we get enough food, enough water, enough shelter for the people, and enough security. I don't think any of us are anywhere near being close to being satisfied, because so much more needs to be done,\" he added. \"[We must] do things smart, as well as fast, and that's a big challenge for us now.\"\nThe Haitian national police chief, Mario Andresol, remarked that electricity blackouts resulted in \"bandits [...] taking advantage to harass and rape women and young girls under the tents,\" adding that 7,000 inmates of prisons escaped after the quake. \"It took us five years to apprehend them. Today they are running wild.\"\nFurther exacerbating the security situation was that the Haitian police force was largely crippled by the disaster, with hundreds of policemen either killed or missing.\n\"At night, people take things. But I don't have a problem. I don't have anything to steal.\" said one local resident, Omen Cola, to AFP.\nChild trafficking, meanwhile, is also an issue; it had been a chronic problem even before the earthquake. The Red Cross has started to register orphaned children, and temporarily sending some to orphanages for shelter, according to a senior advisor for the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), Bo Viktor Nylund.\nUNICEF press official Roshan Khadivi told the Xinhua news agency on Wednesday that \"we are taking photos and filling in forms to get the children's full details on file. Experience has shown us that there is at least one family member left usually. UNICEF does not believe in institutionalization in orphanages. Children need to be connected with their communities.\" Khadivi noted that considering adoption would only be done if the child's parents are not found after several months.\nSixty orphaned children, meanwhile, were transported earlier by plane to Germany, where they are to be adopted; six of them were hospitalised for fatigue and dehydration.\n\"Starting below zero\"; rescue efforts continue.\nEdmond Mulet, the acting head of the UN mission for Haiti, told the BBC that it could take decades to fully reconstruct the country, and any recent development had been negated by the quake. \"I think this is going to take many more decades than only ten years, and this is an enormous backwards step in Haiti's development. We will not have to start from zero but from below zero,\" he said.\nMulet, who is also the UN's assistant peacekeeping operations secretary-general, said that the aid logistics were a \"nightmare\". However, he said he believed the capacity to provide help was improving, saying: \"All this is coming together right now. Every day you can see more and more Haitian national police on the ground, working with our troops and more and more water being distributed, so it's a matter of time and putting all these elements together,\" as quoted by the BBC.\nAccording to the head, 200,000 heavy-duty tents had been ordered, to help people cope with the rainy season, which generally starts in May. \"Of course, 200,000 family-sized tents - solid ones that can withstand a hurricane season - are not available in the market just like that, so they have to be made. It's going to take a few days and weeks before they can arrive, but all this is coming,\" Mulet noted.\nThe Haitian president, Rene Preval, earlier this week asked for 200,000 tents and 26 million ready-to-eat meals to be airdropped.\nLieutenant Colonel Bruce Ewing, commander of Canada's Disaster Assistance Response Team, meanwhile, was concerned whether there was enough management in relief operations. \"Everyone is trying to help, but it's not as coordinated as it should be. We're not getting aid to where it needs to go as effectively as it should be,\" he told AFP.\nEarlier this week, Haitian Prime Minister Jean-Max Bellerive, described the reconstruction process as being a \"colossal work of reconstruction.\"\n\"In 30 seconds, we lost nearly 60 percent of our gross domestic product, because all of Haiti's resources were concentrated in a small area around our seat of government,\" he said. \"We have to decentralise. It's the only way to be efficient. It's also the only way to avoid the same problems happening in Haiti again.\"\nThe UN, meanwhile, reports that international funding and aid pledges for the country have now surpassed US$2 billion worth."}

A foreign ministry spokesman stated that there would be \"repercussions that neither side wishes to see\" if the deal went ahead.\nTaiwan, one of Asia's few functioning democracies, welcomed the proposal, with Taiwanese president Ma Ying-jeou being quoted as saying \"It will let Taiwan feel more confident and secure so we can have more interactions with China.\"\nThe arms deal includes UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters, communications equipment and MIM-104 Patriot missiles, but does not include the F-16 fighter jets that Taiwan's military were looking for. The US is legally obliged to supply Taiwan with defensive weapons under the Taiwan Relations Act 1979.\nIn 2003, an unnamed US briefing stated that \"[the US] would have to get involved if China tried to use coercion or force to unilaterally change the status of Taiwan\"."}

The battle raged on for hours, according to sources. The al-Shabaab group claimed responsibility for the attack.\nTwelve civilians were killed in the incident, while 25 were injured. The Hodan Wardhigley and Howl Wadag districts were the worst hit. Medical authorities claimed that the deaths had occurred when mortar fire had burnt their houses. The fire came from both the insurgents and the peace-keepers, according to the officials. Ali Musa, one of the officials of a volunteer ambulance service in Mogadishu, said that a mother and her two children had died during the firing.\nThe attack commenced on 2 AM, Friday. Awakened by mortar explosions, residents hid inside their houses, while others left for safer places. The battle went on for hours and the sound of the firing emanated to all parts of the Somali capital.\nThis was the most intense fighting in months, claim residents. \"I thought I was dreaming when I heard the sound of the artillery,\" said Asha Abdulle, Mogadishu resident, while Ahmed Hashi said that the fighting was the \"worst in months.\" Nurta Hussein, another resident said: \"We were woken up by the explosions at 2 a.m. and haven't slept since because of the non-stop shelling. Two mortar bombs landed in this neighborhood, killing four civilians and wounding six.\"\nAlmost 20,000 Somali civilians have died since 2007, as a result of multiple insurgent attacks. Almost 1.5 million have been forced to leave the country since that time.\nThe al-Shabab as well as another group, called Hizbul Islam, claimed responsibility in a statement they released. They successfully attacked \"the strongholds of the enemies of Allah,\" claimed the statement. \"The mujahideen attacked AMISOM and government bases last night and we killed some of their troops. When we pulled back, AMISOM began intentionally shelling residential areas. We shall keep on targeting them,\" said the attackers. However Somali officials called the attack \"small and careless.\"\nMogadishu's \"Kilometer Four\" area was one of those affected. It includes a square that connects the airport to the port. While the area has been attacked several times previously, this attack is said to be the worst. African Union peace-keepers from Uganda are posted there.\nThe fighting comes almost a year since Sheikh Sharif Sheikh Ahmed was sworn in as the nation's new president.\nAl-Shabaab is considered a terrorist body by the United States; the latter blames it for multiple attacks, shootings and bombings inside Somalia.\nAl-Shabaab has also threatened other African countries, including Ethiopia, Djibouti, Kenya, Eritrea, Ghana, Sudan and Uganda.\nAn African Union soldier, on a condition of anonymity, said that one Ugandan soldier was killed in the clash. He added that another soldier was wounded. A Somali government official backed this claim. Earlier, on Monday, two AU soldiers had died in another mortar attack in an AU clinic.\nWhen contacted through telephone, Somalia's Defence Minister, Sheikh Yusuf Mohammad Siad, who is a former warlord (also known as \"Inda'ade\" or \"white eyed\") said more than ten insurgents had died in the clash.\nParts of the Shabaab group have connections with al-Qaeda. The former has regularly attacked different parts of Somalia, with suicide bombers and several insurgents, taking advantage of the weak political and military infrastructure of the country.\nThe incident occurred exactly an year following President Sheikh Sharif Ahmed election to the parliament. The government was set to celebrate its first anniversary with a parade and poetry recitations at the presidential palace, named Villa Somalia. It was not known whether the attack intentionally collided with this event. However, it was a reminder of Somalia's weak military power; the army was heavily dependent on the African troops in this attack as well.\nFor over two decades, the country has had no central government. This has led to warlords ruling the nation, which often suffers from attacks by militant groups and pirate ships.\nDuring an African Union (AU) summit Addis Ababa, capital of Ethiopia, Ali Jama' Jangeli, Somali Foreign Minister, requested more African Union troops to assist other soldiers in the capital. Both Kenya and Sudan backed Jangeli; Djibouti answered the call and promised to send 450 soldiers soon.\n\"The situation in Somalia is very grim, it is very precarious. It is threatening stability in the whole of the east Africa region and the Horn of Africa. It is in our interest as a region ... also in the interest of Africa to contribute more troops to Somalia so that there is law and order in Somalia,\" claimed Jangeli's Sudanese counterpart, Deng Alor.\nThe United States and Western nations are supportive of Sheik Sharif Sheik Ahmed's government, amidst fears that Somalia would become a base for al-Qaeda and other such organizations. However, the Somali government controls only few city blocks in the country.\nApart from attacks on government forces, the militants have also bombed the country's principal airport. There also has been an explosion during a college graduation ceremony, claim civilians.\nWestern nations have spent millions of dollars to buy weapons and ammunition for the Somali army. However, since the Shabab group controls a significant part of the country, the Somali government has had limited success. The group has won several battles and displaced millions of Somali people."}

Hindu custom dictates that ashes are scattered over a body of water after cremation, but Gandhi's ashes, Gandhi being cremated after he was assassinated in 1948, were instead divided up and distributed to friends and family. It is difficult to work out how many portions of ashes are still in the hands of the recipients.\nAfter a priest recited hymns, Gandhi's great-grandson poured the ashes into the sea. People then threw flowers into the sea.\nThe ashes were given to the family by a friend, Vilas Mehta, who had decided to keep the ashes as a memento, not realising the Hindu custom. She passed on a \"little silver container\" to her daughter-in-law, who, in turn, gave it to Gandhi's family last year.\nEla Gandhi, the Indian national hero's sixty nine year-old granddaughter, attended the ceremony, as well as making a speech, in which she highlighted the fact that intolerance was still rife. She said, \"I think one of the important messages of his death is the intolerance that goes on in this world, the intolerance of people for other people on the basis of religion, on the basis of race, on the basis of ethnicity, of class and of caste and so on\". She went on to say that the Indian Ocean was chosen as it linked the two countries \"on which he had such a profound influence\".\nGandhi campaigned for rights in both South Africa and India. He is also known as the \"Father of India\", and he was a pioneer of the non-cooperation movement. He is synonymous with peace, and has an award named after him.\nThis is not the first time Gandhi's ashes have resurfaced. In 2008, his ashes were donated to a museum in Mumbai, who scattered them into the Arabian Sea."}

The nationals tried to cross with the children, aged between two months and twelve years, into the Dominican Republic, but were halted at the border.\nThe group belongs to the two-month-old New Life Children's Refuge charity, with some members from Central Valley Baptist Church in Meridian, Eastside Baptist Church in Twin Falls, Idaho, and others from Texas and Kansas. Their claimed intention was to move the quake victims to a temporary orphanage being set up in a hotel-resort in the neighbouring Dominican Republic. Police said the Americans did not have any paperwork or permissions to remove the children from the country. Haiti's government has imposed new restrictions on adoptions due to concerns about child trafficking during the post-disaster confusion.\nThe detainees are being held near the capital, Port-au-Prince, and maintain their arrest was a mistake. Laura Silsby, the group's spokeswoman, insisted on the group acting in good faith and they paid no money for the children. She defended the lack of any authority from Haitian officials, \"I was going to come back here to do the paperwork,\" asserting that Haitian pastor Jean Sanbil, of the Sharing Jesus Ministries, allowed them to move the children. She claimed, \"[w]e had permission from the Dominican Republic government to bring the children to an orphanage that we have there.\"\nHaitian Prime Minister Jean-Max Bellerive disagreed strongly with group's actions; \"[w]e did not arrest Americans, we arrested kidnappers.\" Social Affairs minister, Yves Christallin, told Agence France-Presse that it was \"abduction, not an adoption\". He continued, \"what is important for us in Haiti is that a child needs to have authorisation from this ministry to leave the country\". He stressed, \"[t]his is totally illegal, [...] these people did not have that authorization.\"\nKent Page, a spokesman for UNICEF in Haiti, also weighed in today saying, \"[y]ou can't just go and take a child out of a country \u2013 no matter what country you are in.\"\nThe NCLR group planned to take around 100 children to the Dominican Republic. According to their mission statement, the Baptists' intent was to \"find healing, hope, joy and new life in Christ\" for the Roman Catholic children \"as well as opportunities for adoption into a loving Christian family.\" To that end they partnered with New Life Adoption Foundation to \"help facilitate adoptions and provide grants to subsidize the cost of adoption for loving Christian parents who would otherwise not be able to afford to adopt.\" They envisioned building an orphanage at Villa Magante on the northern coast of the Dominican Republic, with facilities for the children, and lodging and amenities for \"adopting parents to stay while fulfilling requirement for 60\u201090 day visit as well as Christian volunteers/vacationing families.\"\nThe children have been transferred to an SOS Children's village in Santo, to the north of the capital. The site has a medical facility run by the Dominican Red Cross. Staff reported the children were \"in a very bad emotional state\" and that a small baby had to be temporarily taken to the main hospital. Some children told staff they actually have parents, and a twelve year old said she and her family had believed the New Life Children's Refuge group wanted to take her to a boarding school in the Dominican Republic. Later, three people arrived at the SOS Children's village claiming to be relatives of five of the children. They said, \"the woman who took the children to DR\" told them she organised summer camps in the neighbouring country; they declared they did not intent to permanently part with their children. \nAmarick Louis, Haiti's justice secretary, told the Associated Press that a commission would decide today if the group would go before a judge. Senior Pastor Clint Henry of the Central Valley Baptist Church told reporters New Life Children's Refuge, and the Haiti mission, are separate from the 25-year-old church. He noted that members of the church were confronted with negative feedback after the arrest of the NLCR group. His congregation prayed for the arrested members of their church during services on Sunday."}

He cut his own throat and he's cutting his wrists right now. He's got a knife cutting his wrist,\" the caller allegedly told the dispatcher. By the time they arrived, Valenzuela had already fled the scene.\nThe victims were given immediate care, as the girlfriend and her unidentified coworker were rushed to separate local hospitals. The police have stated that the girlfriend was taken into surgery for her injuries, and is currently in stable condition. Neither victim has been identified.\nAfter the suspect's discovery and subsequent surrender to police, he was also taken to Leominster Hospital, where he is currently recuperating from his self-inflicted wounds. Identified by police by his consulate ID card from Guatemala, Valenzuela was allegedly deported from the U.S. four years ago, but re-entered the country illegally at an undetermined date.\nReports differ as to whether the suspect and the woman whose throat he slashed were in a relationship at the time of the incident, or whether they had separated. Police have said that there was a domestic dispute between the couple at the plant about three weeks ago, which was handled by the company's human resource department. Apparently the two were moved to different parts of the plant after the dispute.\nValenzuela is currently being held on $25,000 bail, and is charged with two counts of assault and battery with a dangerous weapon and attempt to murder.

Community issues that we raise are not being addressed, and the current government needs to see that the Electorate cannot be taken for granted.\n What do you do \"in real life\"?\nLM: I am a medical sales professional, a wife and mother and a small business owner.\n What are your three main policies?\nLM: We have many issues in this area that need to be fixed; to look at three main policies by themselves would be to ignore the main issue, which is that our politicians have not acted on the communities concerns.\n How would you address these policies?\nLM: Imagine if our politicians actually took a wider look at the community they represent and then started to address the issues, how much happier would we all be? We will be spelling out what we mean by this at www.lizmumby.ozecommunity.com.au over the next [nine] days.\n Last year, I interviewed Eastern Victorian MLC Peter Hall about trains from his region not going all the way to Southern Cross Station. Is that a problem where you are?\nLM: Whilst Public Transport is an issue, we should not limit the debate to public transport issues just because the retiring member was the Minister for Public Transport. Why hasn't the debate also been about creating more local jobs with greater diversity, so that long-term, people have the choice to avoid the road/rail nightmare?\n How would you go about creating said jobs?\nLM: I would lobby to make the Altona electorate attractive to businesses by questioning their needs when deciding on a location, then acting upon that information to provide for those needs. Improvements to broadband, road and transport infrastructure and access to leisure facilities are some of the areas that need to be examined.\n Do you agree with some of the points made by Mr Hall in the previously mentioned interview? (Needs of traveller, the elderly, etc)\nLM: It is important for the needs of everyone who uses public transport that there is an efficient and effective public transport system, that is easily accessible no matter what age the traveller is. I have elderly parents and a toddler daughter so I can relate to the issues that affect a wide range of age groups.\n Why should the electorate vote for you?\nLM: I'm not a politician, I don't come from a political background, I live in the real world, as part of a community where we raise our children and live our lives. Our electorate has been a safe seat for far too long to the detriment of our community. As the saying goes 'the squeaky wheel gets the oil'. 'Squeak.'"}

The budget the president is sending Congress today puts a priority on those objectives.\" The president blamed the previous George Bush administration for the financial difficulties, saying: \"Over the course of the past 10 years, the previous administration and previous Congresses created an expensive new drug program, passed massive tax cuts for the wealthy and funded two wars without paying for any of it, all of which was compounded by recession and by rising health care costs. As a result, when I first walked through the door, the deficit stood at $1.3 trillion, with projected deficits of $8 trillion over the next decade.\"\n\"It will be impossible to bring the deficit down unless the economy is up. The budget the president is sending Congress today puts a priority on those objectives. It keeps one eye on the economy and the other on the deficit,\" remarked Democrat Representative John Spratt from South Carolina.\n'Quagmire'.\nRepublican senators, however, criticised the plan, citing the proposed tax increases, and suggesting that the deficit is an indication Obama isn't able to control government spending. \"President Obama is submitting another budget that spends too much, taxes too much and borrows too much,\" said the House Minority Leader, John Boehner. \"Serious fiscal responsibility requires more than a few cuts here and there at the margins. Republicans have proposed adopting strict budget caps that limit federal spending on an annual basis and are enforceable by the president.\"\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell commented that \"this budget provides a startling figure that should stop us all in our tracks. According to the administration\u2019s budget, the interest on the federal debt is expected to be nearly 6 trillion dollars over the next decade. We\u2019ve all heard about interest-only loans, but this is the equivalent of an average of $600 billion dollars in interest every year. That\u2019s an astonishing number.\"\nRepublican Senator Judd Gregg also was critical of the plan: \"These circumstances call for a bold, game-changing budget that will turn things around, put in place a plan to restrain spending, reduce the debt and tackle the big entitlement programmes that are growing out of control. Instead, the president has sent us more of the same.\" He described the financial situation as being a \"quagmire\".\nObama's proposal to pull the space plan also drew fire from Republicans. \"The president's proposed Nasa budget begins the death march for the future of US human space flight,\" said Republican Senator Richard Shelby. Obama, however, described the Constellation programme as being \"over budget, behind schedule, and lacking in innovation\", and said it was draining resources from other activities at NASA."}

It alleges that improper maintenance of an American airliner and failure to detect design flaws with the Concorde were responsible for the jet's crash, to an extent that makes the six defendants guilty of involuntary manslaughter.\nBoth official investigations found that a Continental Airlines had taken off five minutes before Concorde with an improvised repair. A metal strip had been machined by mechanics instead of using a certified part. This strip dropped off the aircraft, leaving a 43cm (17in) piece of on the runway.\nProsecutors and investigators concluded that as Concorde struck the part on takeoff a tyre burst and ripped apart, sending chunks of rubber flying. A large piece slammed into the underside of the wing hard enough to trigger a that ruptured the fuel tank. Damaged wiring is believed to have been responsible for igniting this, creating a trailing fireball as the aircraft took off bound for New York. \nConcorde's pilots attempted to circle round for an emergency landing back at , but instead struck a hotel approximately three kilometres (two miles) from the airport. All 109 passengers and crew were on board, as well as four people in the hotel, were killed. The majority of victims were Germans heading to meet up with a cruise liner for a Caribbean holiday, the remainder of the 100 passengers were from Austria.\nJohn Taylor, the Continental mechanic who is alleged to have built and fitted the nonstandard part, and his boss Stanley Ford, have been targeted for prosecution. Both individuals and their employer deny responsibility. Also charged are two members of the UK-French firm behind Concorde - , who have since merged into Airbus parent . Henri Perrier was head of testing for Concorde and the aircraft's chief engineer was Jacques Herubel; both have been charged for a perceived failure to locate and rectify design flaws with Concorde. The former chief of civil aviation, Claude Frantzen, is facing charges on the same basis.\nEach individual can be imprisoned for up to three years and fined up to \u20ac50,900 (US$71,000. Continental face a fine of up to \u20ac375,000 (US$520,000). The airline's defence claims the part on the runway had no role to play in the accident. TV channel previously suggested the investigations and prosecution were a coverup of more serious issues with Concorde.\nThe broadcast alleged Concorde erupted into flames long before getting as far down the runway as the strip. Continental's lawyers say they can call 28 witnesses to give similar evidence and told the \"\" that they would seek a dismissal of the charges today. The case opened with judge Dominique Andreassier reading out every one of the 113 names of the deceased, followed by the charges against the six, in the court in .\nThere are 80,000 pages of documents to be presented at trial, and 543 items are to be presented as evidence. The case is split into 90 volumes and is expected to take four months. The judge cautioned against losing touch with the human aspect of what is anticipated to be a very technical trial. The estimated cost is expected to be in excess of 3 million Euro (US$4.2 million).\nThe investigation found some contributory causes that can be linked to Air France. Four days before the crash an important tyre spacer was left off the Concorde by mechanics, and the plane was overloaded. The airport itself was also criticised for having cancelled a scheduled sweep of the runway. Air France lawyer Fernand Garnault, an aviation specialist, was adamant that Continental did play the main role in the accident; \"[i]t is clear that a piece from a Continental plane fell on the runway. It is clear that the origin of the accident was this. This is my personal conviction and of course that of Air France.\"\nFew families are represented at the trial, because all the passengers struck a deal with Air France to accept compensation in exchange for waiving their right to take legal action, leaving only those killed in the hotel and the crew. However, French group Fenvac are representing the families, and spokesman Stephane Gicquel said that the families would be observing keenly, that \"[t]his tragedy is part of their personal history and of their family history.\"\nCaptain Christian Marty's family's lawyer, Roland Rappaport, said outside court today that, \"[t]his accident should have been avoided. The weaknesses of the Concorde had been known for twenty years,\" while Air France's lawyers stated the inquiries had not located any evidence to suggest that Concorde had indeed encountered problems before reaching the metal debris.\nDaniel Soulez Larivi\u00e8re, who represents Frantzen, said, \"this accident was unforeseeable,\" and the original investigations should have agreed. Concorde suffered a string of similar incidents in the 1970s including one in Washington that came close to triggering a fire. \"They [the authorities] wanted to protect Concorde, the image of France that it projected. They should have stopped service then [1979],\" said Olivier Metzner, representing Continental. The plane was not grounded until after the accident, although it returned to service before being retired in 2003.\nMetzner told the court that former French air accident investigator Michel Bourgeois was to be a key witness. Bourgeois recently alleged that authorities were indeed hiding flaws with the airliner, saying \"[n]othing was allowed to disturb Air France [...] orders came from very high in the administration,\" and that investigations into Concorde's safety were shut down by the government."}

The three-hour session was held in the Queen Elizabeth II Conference Centre in London's City of Westminster.\nShort, an outspoken critic of the war, retired from the cabinet to become an independent MP two months before the invasion. She claimed to have been \"conned\" into staying on despite her doubts about the war and told the inquiry that the Cabinet, of which she was a part, was not a \"decision-making body\", and that Parliament was simply a \"rubber stamp\".\nLord Goldsmith's decision.\nShe also claimed that Tony Blair \"and his mates\" had acted \"on a wing and a prayer\", having \"leaned on\" then-Attorney General for England and Wales Lord Peter Goldsmith, pressurising him to change his mind about the invasion. She did, however, admit that she had no evidence to support these claims. Goldsmith gave a verdict that the war would be legal only shortly before the invasion, having firmly held the belief that it would not be without a further United Nations Security Council resolution.\nShort was applauded as she concluded her testimony, in which she said that she was \"shocked\" at how a definitive statement about the legality of the war circulated only as late as March 17, 2003 \u2014 just three days before the invasion began \u2014 that this state of shock led her to be \"jeered at\" by other ministers. Said statement, according to Short, contained no hint that Goldsmith had previously had any doubts whatsoever.\nShe said any discussion of legality was stopped at the same pre-war cabinet meeting. She accused Blair of standing in the way of such discussion, and said, \"Everything that's happened since makes me know that there was deliberate blockage and there were also all sorts of secret, private meetings\", and that normal cabinet communications were \"closed down\" as the invasion approached. \"There was never a meeting that said 'what's the problem, what are we trying to achieve, what are our military, diplomatic options?' We never had that coherent discussion ... never.\"\nGoldsmith responded to her inquiries about the lateness of this statement by saying \"it takes me a long time to make my mind up\", and that he had made his decision after consulting foreign legal professionals. She said that Goldsmith's \"doubts and his changes of opinion\" made her \"think for the attorney general to come and say there's unequivocal legal authority to go war was misleading.\" She said that \"I think he misled the cabinet. He certainly misled me, but people let it through\". \nShe claimed that the government, having failed to secure a required UN resolution, started the \"untrue\" rumour that France had vetoed it. She said that she \"believed them at the time. You don't want to disbelieve your Prime Minister in the run-up to war and you want to believe the leader of your party. You want to be loyal\".\nUN involvement.\nWhen asked why she had not resigned earlier than she did, she said that she \"was conned\" by Blair's promises of a strong role for the UN in the reconstruction of Iraq, as well as more attempts to resolve the conflict about Israel. She said that she \"thought that if we got a Palestinian state and a UN lead on reconstruction, that will be much better ... I took a lot of flak for it. I still think, if we had done those things, it would have been a heck of a lot better.\" She says that this lack of UN involvement in the post-invasion reconstruction effort was her main reason for retiring from the government.\nShort said that she \"was seeing the intelligence\" about Iraq at the earlier stages of preparation for an invasion, but that in late 2002 \"asked for a briefing... This just didn't come and didn't come... it became clear there was some sort of block on communications.\" Apparently, the intelligence reports she say said that \"Saddam Hussein didn't have nuclear [weapons] ... [he] would if he could but he was nowhere near it. It wasn't saying there was some new imminent threat\".\nTony Blair, 9/11, and post-war planning.\nShort asserted Blair's evidence, given to the inquiry on Friday, was \"historically inaccurate\", since \"[t]here was no evidence of any kind of an escalation of threats\" after the September 11 terrorist attacks on the World Trade Centre. This is contrary to Blair's claims that attitudes towards the threat Iraq posed \"changed dramatically\" after the attacks, and that Saddam Hussein \"threatened not just the region but the world\".\nShe said, \"We could have gone more slowly and carefully and not have had a totally destabilised and angry Iraq. The American people were misled to suggest that al-Qaeda had links to Saddam Hussein. Everybody knows that is untrue - that he had absolutely no links, no sympathy, al-Qaeda were nowhere near Iraq until after the invasion and the disorder that came from that.\" Short criticised the military for not meeting the obligations laid out for them, as an occupying force, by the Geneva Convention.\nBackground and response.\nLord Boyce, the former head of the British armed forces, said in an earlier hearing that officials from the Department for International Development \u2014 Short's department \u2014 let their opposition to the war prevent them from cooperating fully with the rest of the government immediately after the invasion. Alistair Campbell, Blair's former spokesman, said that Short had been \"difficult to handle\" in the run-up to the invasion, and that there was fear that she may leak pieces of information that she did not agree with. Lord Andrew Turnbull, former Secretary of the Cabinet, however, said that these concerns were unfair, and that minority voices had been unfairly pushed to the sidelines.\nHilary Benn, who took over Short's post after her resignation, is scheduled to give evidence before the inquiry today."}

The Bombardier Dash 8 Q400, crashed into a residence killing everyone on board as well as one on the ground.\nThe NTSB has blamed pilot error and poor training for the crash, noting that the plane's captain, Marvin Renslow, \"had not established a good foundation of attitude instrument flying skills early in his career, and his continued weaknesses in basic aircraft control and instrument flying were not identified and adequately addressed.\" Renslow's career spanned two decades and had failed five performance checks during that time. Colgan Air was only aware of three. Colgan said had they known about the other two, they would not have hired Renslow in 2005. \nColgan Air responded to the NTSB report in a letter: \"They [the pilots] knew what to do in the situation they faced that night a year ago, had repeatedly demonstrated they knew what to do, and yet did not do it. We cannot speculate on why they did not use their training in dealing with the situation they faced.\" \nThe Board added that Renslow's response to the \"stick shaker activation should have been automatic, but his improper flight control inputs were inconsistent with his training and were instead consistent with startle and confusion. The 24-year-old first officer, Rebecca Lynne Shaw, was noted for her young age and lack of experience.\nThe Board also concluded that \"the pilots' performance was likely impaired because of fatigue.\" Renslow and Shaw had spent the night at the crew lounge at Newark Liberty International Airport in violation of Colgan Air's company policies. However, the board voted down making fatigue a contributing factor. Shaw, the first officer, had flown the previous night on two separate planes from the Pacific Northwest where she lived with her parents. Shaw also appeared to be suffering from a bad cold.\nHowever, the report also criticized Colgan saying that the airline, \"did not pro-actively address the pilot fatigue hazards associated with operations at a predominantly commuter base.\" Adding that, \"Operators have a responsibility to identify risks associated with commuting, implement strategies to mitigate these risks, and ensure that their commuting pilots are fit for duty.\"\nAnother factor brought up the by the NTSB was the violation of the Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) sterile cockpit rule. It was noted that first officer Shaw had sent two text messages before take-off at Newark. The second message was sent two minutes before take-off.\nPrior to landing, the cockpit voice recorder recorded that the pilots were holding a conservation that potentially distracted the captain from operating the plane. Robert Sumwalt, a member of the NTSB board said, \"It was continuous and one-sided, with the captain doing most of the talking.\" He added, \"It was as if the flight was just a means for the captain to conduct a conversation with this young first officer.\" \nThe chairwoman of the NTSB, Deborah Hersman, has noted that electronic devices are becoming a hazard to transportation. Hersman said, \"Recent NTSB investigations have identified personal wireless technology use on the job. This phenomenon is becoming more widespread, and these phone calls, texts and other distractions have deadly consequences and must be addressed with all due haste by the transportation industry.\"\nThe agency noted that distractions from electronics have played a part in many recent accidents and incidents, such as the August 2009 mid-air collision between a small private Piper aeroplane and a tour helicopter over the Hudson River in New York City killing all involved. The NTSB noted that one of the air traffic controllers was making a phone call and failed to warn the aircraft of the conflict that existed between each other in their airspace. However, this was disputed by the National Air Traffic Controllers Association which represents air traffic controllers nationwide. The NTSB later retracted some of its statements.\nThe other notable incident was that of Northwest Airlines Flight 188 in October, that overshot its destination of Minneapolis-Saint Paul International Airport by 150 miles (241 km) before the pilots noticed. The pilots claimed they were checking schedules on their laptop computers in violation of basic piloting rules, the sterile cockpit rule and the policy of Delta Air Lines, who had recently acquired Northwest.\nThe NTSB's last board meeting which was held two weeks ago, about the 2008 train collision between a Metrolink commuter rail train and a Union Pacific freight train in Chatsworth, California also pertained to distractions by electronic devices. In the statement released by the NTSB for that meeting, the board stated that \"according to records from the wireless provider, on the day of the accident, while on duty, both the Metrolink engineer and the Union Pacific conductor used wireless devices to send and receive text messages.\" The NTSB has recommended that audio and video recorders be installed in locomotive and control cabs because of the collision."}

His crimes would involve going into houses of people who had entrusted house keys to him as he was employed by them as a handyman or a gardener. He then searched through drawers for underwear before carrying out sex acts and stealing or replacing the underwear, and then leaving the properties. He also stole some garments. The burglaries took place in the villages of Stalmine and Poulton-le-Fylde between the dates of January 1 and June 26 in 2009.\nOne person became suspicious and installed a hidden camera inside her bedroom. As a result, a 14 minute DVD was recorded which shows the former mayor walking naked from the waist downwards. The DVD was passed on to the police. Police officers later raided Stafford's residence and found the underwear, which had been marked with the names of the owners. The underwear is said to have been worth up to \u00a3900 (US$1407).\nThe trial was held in Preston Crown Court. There the Court heard of how the victims had been \"embarrassed, disgusted and shocked\" by the \"sexual kicks\" which the man had been getting. During a previous interview with police, Ian Stafford commented at how he felt \"deeply ashamed at the whole scenario because I have hurt people who have been excellent friends - I could not wish for better. I wish I had said something to someone earlier. I am not proud of any of this, I am sickened. I wish I could turn the clock back.\" \nInside the court on Thursday, Judge Heather Lloyd said to Stafford: \"Your private desires or fantasies which should only be your concern became public when you decided to do what you did in the homes of those who trusted you. To masturbate into a woman's underwear and place it back in the draw [\"sic\"], repeatedly, as seen in the DVD, as you have done in other homes is bluntly revolting and the impact on your victims is high.\" She sentenced Ian Stafford to two years in prison, with the recommendation that he takes therapy, a decision which was supported by Stafford's fourth victim.\nAfter the court trial had concluded, Detective Constable Steve Montgomery, who comes from Lancashire Police, stated: \"This has been a distressing ordeal for the victims involved, all of whom had let Mr Stafford into their homes, trusting him to carry out maintenance. They certainly did not expect him to search for, and steal, their possessions. There has been a breach of their trust in a very intimate nature.

He was arrested in August 2008 after disobeying a stop sign in Naperville. Police searched his car and found marijuana and drug paraphernalia. This was the third time Benfield had been arrested for having marijuana since April 2007, when drugs were found in his possession at Naperville Central High School. Last October, a judge issued a fine and required him to join the DuPage County Sheriff's Work Alternative Program. He has also received five tickets within three months in 2008 for driving violations, including speeding,\u00a0driving without insurance, transportation of an open alcohol container, and driving too fast for conditions.\nBensfield's mother also has an order of protection against him. Ms. Bensfield stated that he asked her for money in late December; he then broke into her home in Naperville's far southeast-side, punching holes in the walls and breaking various items before leaving. Christopher was arrested Dec. 29 and faced a misdemeanor charge of criminal damage to property. He \"suffers from bipolar disorder and has not been taking his medication,\" according to information the \"Naperville Daily Herald\" has received from Ms. Bensfield."}

During rehearsals for a series of return concerts planned in London, England last year, the entertainer had employed the doctor to be his personal physician for the spring.

The author of the report was Konrad Godlewski; several weeks later, Godlewski began editing Polish Wikipedia. The results of his work include one featured article \u2013 pismo chi\u0144skie (Polish for \"Chinese character\") \u2013 as well as various articles relating to China.\nDuring our interview, Godlewski discusses memes, hoaxes, and the \"Batuta Army\" \u2013 the creators of the hoax his paper reported on. From February this year, a special project on the Polish Wikipedia, BATUTA, saw a makeshift taskforce work on improving the quality of content. BATUTA stands for \"Bezwzgl\u0119dna Akcja Troskliwego U\u017ar\u00f3d\u0142awiania Tysi\u0119cy artyk\u0142\u00f3w\", roughly translated as \"Ruthless Action of Carefully Adding References to Thousands of Articles\".\nInterview.\n You are the author of the first news story about the Henryk Batuta hoax, uncovered four years ago in the Polish Wikipedia. Do you remember when did the authors of the hoax first come to you? Was it just before the publication or earlier? The hoax was uncovered on January 20 and the story was published on February 9, so there was a period of time between those two dates... \nI found them myself. Accidentally. I was looking for new, interesting stories about the Internet. My newspaper colleague Robert Sankowski told me he had heard somewhere about a friend of a friend who had been doing some huge scam in Wikipedia. Step by step, I had traced that person. This was a few months before the publication, back in late 2005. A representative from Batuta's Army asked me to hold on with publication, even though the article had already been visible in Wikipedia for many months.\nDid you follow the process of deletion of the article? \nYes, for the last few days. The Army from the very beginning wanted to test Wikipedia's defense mechanisms. It was then when I had a meeting with them and they told me about their views. They knew their hoax was nearing its end and they wanted to close it somehow. \nIn your story you wrote they wanted to show how thoughtless the people of Warsaw were when it came to names of streets and neighborhoods. Now it turns out it was more about Wikipedia and its mechanisms. \nIt was about a number of things at the same time. It was easy to notice the hoax was created by really smart people. Testing Wikipedia was one of the aspects of this entire thing.\nThe second one was the attitude towards streets and generally Poland's communist past. As one could easily guess, Batuta's Army had rather right-wing political views, most probably close to IPN [e.d. note: Instytut Pami\u0119ci Narodowej/IPN, English: National Memory Institute is a governmental agency in Poland conducting both criminal investigations and scientific research into the country's communist past], which fights against communist streets' namesakes. \nAnd there was a third reason. As I'm sure you remember, in the 90s, conspiracy theories concerning Jews were popular in Poland. As some of the people of such origin had changed their names, the conspiracy theory made people see Jews nearly everywhere. Such lists were printed on paper and later they got published on the Internet.\nIt's a bit strange. Having right-wing views, the Army caused the right-wing websites, which copied the hoax from Wikipedia, to get discredited as an effect of this.\nNot all right-wing people are uneducated individuals with antisemitic views. \nThe same IP number (which is dynamic but from a narrow range) which was used to create the hoax, is still being used today to edit Wikipedia. For example, quite recently someone tried to smuggle in a biography of \"Hipolit Pie\u015bciuk \u2013 sculptor and social activist\". Google shows no information on this biography. They've added just text, not an article. Does it mean they have not give up on Wikipedia? Your article in \"Gazeta Wyborcza\" ended with the words \"Batuta's Army is asking for anonymity and claims that Henryk Batuta is not their last word\".\nI haven't heard about Hipolit. As far as I know, Batuta's case actually turned up to be their last word. As far as I know those people have made careers and they now have more serious things to care about. \nSo they don't want to reveal themselves?\nI imagine it wouldn't look good in their CVs. There are people who think of such scam as a point of honor. I don't think that's the case with Batuta's Army. Anyway, this case had also had an effect on me. Before the Batuta story I had made a few trial editions in Wikipedia. But later something turned me on. I thought there was a group of idealistic people who want to make humanity happier with their meticulous work. And someone tried to make idiots of them. \nSo you've started to develop articles up to featured article standards.\nDon't exaggerate. I've written just one such article. But thanks to this, I've realized how important Wikipedia had become. I don't think there is single journalist who doesn't use it. \nWould you reveal your Wikipedia nickname? \nYes, it's actually my high school nickname \u2013 conew. Sadly, after some time I stopped. My family got bigger and I didn't have enough time to make all of humanity happier.\nWhen we were talking soon after your publication, you wrote to me you had hoped there would be some positive effects of your story. Do you think you've initiated a landslide change?\nI don't think it was a landslide. But still, I do acknowledge the fact that Batuta's case has become something of a milestone in the development of Wikipedia. I had a chance to about it with Jimmy Wales. It was in the time when the German Wikipedia was testing new, stricter editorial guidelines.\nHowever, I think the most important was the impact on the other side \u2013 the readers. Even the best editorial system lets some mistakes pass undetected. I know it, I've worked in several newspapers. Batuta's case reminds us the old truth: \"dubito ergo sum\". There are mistakes in respected encyclopedias and books as well. Sometimes those are \"Dawkins-like\" mistakes, if you remember the chapter about memes in \"The Selfish Gene\".\nMy favorite example is the one about Micha\u0142 Boym, Polish Jesuit and one of the first sinologists. He had done a great job with his descriptions of Chinese plants and animals. His works were later published in Europe. Sometimes his text were stolen from him and published under other people's names. There was a case of \"green-furred turtle\". Boym wrote about it because it was extremely bizarre: a turtle with green fur. In fact it was a kind of seaweed growing on the turtle's shell. Boym described it in his Latin text as \"viridium\". And printers from Vienna made it \"vindium\" which can be translated as \"floating in air\". This slight typing mistake made people in the West believe there were flying turtles in China. What's more, there were pictures showing this unusual thing. \nBatuta also started to mutate and it happened at the very beginning. \nThat's because Wikipedia's articles are the best example of memetics at work. The articles are like some living organisms transferred to a new environment \u2013 with time they evolve, adapting to the requirements such as neutral of point of view, proper language, verifiability and, most importantly, factual truth. \nIn the printed edition of \"Gazeta Wyborcza\" your text was accompanied by a photo, supposedly showing Henryk Batuta. It actually did not appear in the Wikipedia article, but even Jimbo mentioned that photo when he was explaining this situation to the journalists.\nOh yes. The photo was the idea of the editor of that day's edition. It's a petty it is now stuck somewhere in Gazeta'sarchives because it a really great job by the photo editor. Maybe Wikipedia should ask \"Gazeta\" for permission to use this little masterpiece. \nWhen I read some recent texts about Batuta I often come across different mutations of the story. The most common is the one which says the journalists were the ones who uncovered the hoax, in spite of the fact that your text was published several days after the uncovering made by the Wikimedians themselves. \nThat's correct. It is quite common to attribute different things to the journalists because of their job which is to go around, look and investigate. I've seen Batuta being quoted in many publications on Wikipedia and the Internet. This is part of a broader problem of credibility of sources. It's horrifying but we are surrounded by the half-truths and lies. \nRoman, W\u0142adys\u0142aw, Marek \u2013 the names of the members of Batuta's Army were obviously false as well? \nYes, they were \"alternative\".\nWas the term \"Batuta's Army\" created after you had already begun to talk? Or maybe they came to you already with this term? \nBatuta's Army was invented by the hoax' creators as we spoke. Probably they wanted it to sound like some well-know political terrorist organizations like IRA or Red Army Faction. It was a kind of joke.\nNews about Batuta became a \"good meme\" and later it began to live a life of its own. Many legends originated from this story. Do you think it will become a \"hard\" urban legend?\nI had thought so, but fortunately the Wikimedians woke up right in time and put an end to this. Today the original Batuta article is like an antibody in a vaccine \u2013 accompanied by a secure commentary, it can be used by anyone for the sake of his/her own immunity against such a \"virus\". However, another \"Jewish conspiracy\" theory is still thriving. It has something to do with Batuta's article, as in the hoax he was a communist activist with you-know-what origin. The theory I'm talking about was made popular by Okhrana (Russian secret police from the tzars times) with the publication of \"The Protocols of the Elders of Zion\". It has made its way as far as to Japan. Recently I've been following its spread in China. A book called \"The Currency Wars\" has recently been published there. The author used to work at American financial institutions. When he came back to China, he wrote the book describing how America's finances are under control by a group of friends with common ancestry. \nI don't think there's any way of defense against a good hoax. I'm sure at least a few such Batutas are hiding somewhere in Wikipedia. It's a classical evolutionary arms race. \nWhen media published a story about a hoax concerning a false product (medicine for hangover), they praised the company for visionary marketing, despite the fact it came down to a deception. Why in the conflict between citizens and business, the media represents the corporations?\nSometimes they do and sometimes they don't. I don't think you can simplify it to such an extent. This is a chain: journalist \u2013 editor \u2013 publisher \u2013 owner. Each of the elements has its own motivations and there is little in common between them. That's maybe with the exception of desire for profit. But there are also some journalists who work mainly for their ideals.\nI don't remember in detail that particular case, but a tendency to deceive is part of the human nature. What's more, people enjoy being deceived, they appreciate manipulation as long as it's witty and funny. One of the authors compared Batuta's case to provocations which are the basis of the modern conceptual art. The artist gets into the public space and shocks people in order to make them react, to make the viewer part of the game. \nMaybe it's my oversimplification indeed. And maybe that's because Wikipedia itself is being perceived as if it was a corporation. I remember when Google's Knol was launched and one of the media stories called Knol David and Wikipedia Goliath. \nIt's a question of marketing and public relations. Google, as any modern company, spends a lot of money to create and maintain the image of both itself and its products. And Wikipedia is a bunch of Internet users who tries to set its own order by democratic means. It's part of democracies' nature that they need years to earn their own ethos, image and culture of organization. Just compare Polish and British democracy. \nOK, so I classically thank you for talking to me. \nThank you."}

Inside the jungle, having been reduced to rations of beans and rice, the two celebrities caught a rat before killing it and then cooking it, to give the beans and rice \"more protein\", before eating the rat, which contestant and actor George Hamilton described as \"actually quite nice\". Inside the programme's video diary room, at the time of the recording of it, Gino D'Acampo said: \"I saw one of these rats running around. I got a knife, I got its throat, I picked it up.\"\nRSPCA Australia had stated that performing an act like this on television was \"not acceptable\". Initially, Manning and D'Acampo were charged for animal cruelty. However, their charges were dropped when ITV made the confession that production staff had allowed the celebrities to carry out the act of killing the rat. After a court trial in Sydney, Australia, ITV got a fine of A$3000. The company also had to pay costs of A$2500 (US$2192 or \u00a31396).\nAn ITV spokesperson said that \"ITV has apologised for the mistake which led to this incident. The production was unaware that killing a rat could be an offence, criminal or otherwise in New South Wales, and accepts that further inquiries should have been made. This was an oversight and we have since thoroughly reviewed our procedures and are putting in place a comprehensive training programme to ensure that this does not happen in future series.\""}

He was then handed over to American authorities who covertly transported him to Morocco for interrogation on a suspicion that he received training on the handling of munitions from al-Qaeda in Afghanistan. His final destination, after two years in Morocco, was Guant\u00e1namo Bay; from 2004 until 2009 he was held in the US-run detention centre in Cuba. He was released last February without any charges being brought against him.\nToday's ruling, by the the Court of Appeal's three most senior judges, ordered previously redacted paragraphs detailing Binyam's treatment in US-managed captivity made public. The seven previously withheld paragraphs appear in a report on the Foreign and Commonwealth Office's website. They had purportedly been kept secret over fears publication would jeopardise intelligence sharing between the US and UK. A court ruling in August 2008 did ensure the redacted details were available to Binyam's legal team; however, this is their first release to a wider public.\nBinyam had, prior to May 2001, been subjected to a succession of interviews, \"as part of a new strategy designed by an expert interviewer.\" During this interrogation, Binyam Mohamed \"had been intentionally subjected to continuous sleep deprivation. The effects of the sleep deprivation were carefully observed [...] combined with the sleep deprivation, threats and inducements were made to him. His fears of being removed from United States custody and 'disappearing' were played upon [...] the stress brought about by these deliberate tactics was increased by him being shackled in his interviews\".\nThe effects of his treatment were apparently quite detrimental; \"[i]t was clear not only from the reports of the content of the interviews but also from the report that he was being kept under self-harm observation, that the interviews were having a marked effect upon him and causing him significant mental stress and suffering.\"\nIn February last year, Miliband denied that the United States threatened to reduce or cease terrorism-related intelligence sharing, but fought to keep the details released today secret; arguing publication would, \"cause real and significant damage to the national security and international relations of this country.\"\nThe release of information known in 2001 implies that Foreign Office Minister Ivan Lewis misled the BBC's Today programme when, in August last year, he stated that, \"[w]e neither engage in, collude with or condone torture.\" The interview by Sarah Montague, with Lewis in Damascus, Syria, saw the minister challenged on the basis that the UK might \"turn a blind eye\" to torture. Lewis responded that, \"we always make it clear that torture is unacceptable and abhorrent\"; however, this was qualified, \"in a modern world you cannot counter terrorism by acting in isolation; we have to work on a global basis with many other countries. And it\u2019s true that some of those countries don\u2019t apply the same rules and the same standards as the United Kingdom\".\nLewis denied that the UK was \"complicit\" in torture, although his responses in the interview described information such as that released today as \"very serious allegations made against some of the intelligence services in some countries that we have to co-operate with in terms of protecting the security and the national interest of this country.\""}

Both were Boeing 777 aircraft. That incident prompted the AAIB to collaborate with the US National Transportation Safety Board. \nBA 38 was approximately 43 seconds from touchdown when it experienced a dual engine rollback that was beyond the control of the flight crew. Captain Peter Burkill and co-pilot John Coward were later hailed as heroes for performing a successful crash landing 330 metres from the runway. The plane avoided nearby buildings and a road, leaving the landing gear deployed to act as shock absorbers. \nThe jet slid 372 metres after the crash, but all 136 passengers evacuated alive. 36 passengers and twelve crewmembers were injured, mostly suffering whiplash and one incurring a broken leg. The report concluded there was no time to alert the cabin crew or passengers to the situation developing in the cockpit.\nThe engine rollback was caused by ice forming in the fuel system; the ice came from water molecules existing as impurities in the fuel, and lined the fuel system. When extra fuel was pumped through to supply the engines for landing manoeuvres, the ice was dislodged. \nIt is believed to have then settled on a component called the fuel-oil heat exchanger, a dual-purpose component that runs oil pipes through the fuel system. The idea is to cool down hot oil and keep fuel warm to prevent freezing. As the result of previous safety recommendations from both the UK and US investigators Boeing and engine company Rolls-Royce have worked to redesign the part.\nEvery component of the aircraft complied with all relevant airworthiness standards, and the fuel also complied with the standards applying to it. Although ice problems have been known since the 1950s, sudden release problems were unheard of before the crash.

MusicDNA uses similar compression methods to mp3, but then also adds an xml file which defines other content that can be included. Wikinews reporter caught up with Bach Technology CEO Stefan Kohlmeyer to find out more.\nInterview.\nThank you for agreeing to answer our questions.\nCan you briefly explain what MusicDNA is?\nWe believe that MusicDNA is the successor to the MP3, the MusicDNA media extension enables music fans to access from one application the wide range of music-related content they want alongside the music itself - from lyrics, artwork and tour dates to blog posts, videos and twitter feeds.\nIn addition to all this extra content, MusicDNA files are also intelligent, and include extensive audio analysis information for each single track. This means that search and recommendation tools or automatic playlist generators will be much more sophisticated and provide much better results.\nHow long has it been in development and what role has Karlheinz Brandenburg, the man credited with inventing mp3, played in that?\nIn essence MusicDNA in its current context has been in development since the start of the company in 2007. Bach has an important strategic partnership with Fraunhofer IDMT with its CEO Karlheinz Brandenburg who is an important person for us in all research projects and visionary discussions about the development of the music market.\n Is this just going to be another consumer hurting format war with iTunes LP? What makes MusicDNA better than iTunes LP?\nUnlike iTunes LP, MusicDNA files have been built on open standards and are completely platform agnostic, which means that, unlike iTunes LP, you\u2019re not tied to one device or media player. So it\u2019s about the opposite of format wars really.\nWhilst LP goes some way to adding value to digital music, it is still essentially a static file with some extra content bolted on. MusicDNA not only gives back all the things we lost when we switched to digital formats, lyrics, liner notes, artwork, but crucially it goes beyond that allowing fans to access everything from Twitter feeds and videos through to concert tickets, this will all dynamically update whenever you're online, so music fans always have the latest information to hand.\nImportantly with MusicDNA you can customise single tracks, you\u2019re not restricted to purchasing complete albums as you are with LP.\nAnd because all the additional rich media is integrated into the file (unlike iTunes LP), that content can be easily transferred from one device to another.\nMark Mulligan, vice president and research director of industry analysts Forrester Research recently put it well to the UK\u2019s \"Telegraph\" newspaper \"innovations like the iTunes LP need to go further. People should pay just once to get everything that artist does over the next year in one file that is regularly updated.\"\nIs this really what listeners want-more clutter to distract from the music itself? What's wrong with mp3?\nA lot of people, especially those who grew up buying music on vinyl and CD, miss the packaging, the liner notes, all the things that went hand in hand with albums, so for them that \u2018clutter\u2019 is an important part of the experience. \nWe developed MusicDNA based on how people interact with their favourite music and musicians today, so we\u2019re just following the public\u2019s lead in many ways. MusicDNA enables fans to stay constantly connected with the worlds of their favourite artists in a really convenient way. Importantly, MusicDNA files can be customised so that they contain as little or much extra content as the listener wants.\nYou have to remember the MP3 was developed over twenty years ago, think of how much has changed in that time. It has had a profound effect on the music industry, but beyond portability it doesn't actually add anything to the experience, the opposite in fact.\nWill MusicDNA be any less susceptible to piracy than other formats?\nAs only paid for files will dynamically update MusicDNA should be an incentive for people to purchase legitimate files rather than downloading them from p2p networks.\nOver the last decade a lot of effort has gone into trying to stop piracy through sanctions and enforcement, and, well, the results speak for themselves. We believe in a carrot approach, giving the public what they actually want and a great incentive to go the legit route.\nMany people argue that music is moving away from being owned and more towards models like Spotify; free, streamed music. Is MusicDNA not too late to the party if this is so?\nLike many in the industry Bach are of the view that there is no one silver bullet to suit all types of consumer, rather a variety of services will serve different fans with different needs.\nThere are many occasions when a download is preferable to a stream, and MusicDNA files have the advantage of customised, at your fingertips, rich media available on- and offline. And that is before considering the impact of streaming on growing bandwidth and energy requirements.\nSo when will we start to see MusicDNA and where?\nRollout will be staggered over 2010, with the first beta versions available around Easter and the full commercial rollout expected over summer.\nAnd finally, your favourite artist at the moment to be released on MusicDNA this year?\nIt's too early to say, but we're in talks with some very exciting artists. I would love to see all my old heroes on MusicDNA, starting with Led Zeppelin and The Clash.\nThank you again for your time. Good luck with the launch."}

The prosecution of Antasari Azhar and three others has been controversial, with some fearing the so-called \"Judicial Mafia\" played a role. \nThe Corruption Eradication Commission (KPK) already saw a proven plot to discredit it and frame its senior members. Shortly after Azhar's arrest in May last year police came to take away Bibit Rianto and Chandra Hamzah, two deputy commissioners, to face trial for corruption. The trial, instead, unveiled a plot to convict the men of offences they had not committed. Protests in the street ensued, and locals gave corrupt officials the joint nickname of the \"Judicial Mafia\".\nThe scandal resulted in the resignations of a chief detective and a deputy attorney general; the KPK had begun probing the attorney general's office and that of the national police. During Azhar's time as chair the KPK has exposed bribery at the former and prosecuted an in-law relative of the president during the country's election preparations, with a jail sentence being the result.\nThe defendants had claimed political elements orchestrated a conspiracy to see the quartet convicted. The judges disagreed, with judge Herri Swantoro telling the court, \"Defendant Antasari Azhar has been legitimately proven guilty of participating in persuading the carrying out of a premeditated murder.\" The court's judgement ran to 179 pages.\nThe case saw the four accused of plotting the March 2009 murder of tycoon Nasruddin Zulkarnaen, shot dead in his car by a motorbike assassin in Jakarta. Zulkarnaen was Azhar's golfing partner and the businessman was alleged by the prosecution to have been blackmailing the KPK leader, who is a former prosecutor.\nAzhar is alleged to have had an affair with one of Zulkarnaen's wives, a golf caddie. With Zulkarnaen threatening to inform the press and parliament, Azhar is alleged to have plotted murder with several other officials. Police commissioner Wiliardi Wizar was accused of locating the assassins used; he claimed his senior had ordered him to testify he had been told by Azhar to kill Zulkarnaen.\nMedia mogul Sigid Haryo Wibisono stood accused of financing the contract killing, and businessman Jerry Hermawan Lo of arranging a meeting with the gunmen. All three were convicted alongside Azhar, who received an eighteen-year prison sentence. Wizar was jailed for twelve years, Wibisono for fifteen and Lo for five. All intend to appeal the verdicts.\nOne person who feels the court got it wrong is a human rights lawyer who defended Bibit and Chandra. \"I think that this is all still a mystery,\" said Taufik Basari. \"I don't think the judge had all the necessary facts to warrant a verdict of eighteen years.\"\nDespite the conviction of his relative, Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono retained the presidency last June by a landslide majority. Originally elected in 2004, Yudhoyono has used an anti-corruption stance in his campaigns, heaping praise upon the KPK which Azhar was head of from December 2007 until his arrest.\nThe four new convicts join five men convicted of the murder in December. Alleged to have comprised the gang behind the shooting, they received sentences varying from seventeen to eighteen years imprisonment.\nSources.\n "}

Such a show of support ultimately did not lead the Warriors to victory, however, even with 6-foot, 9-inch The College of William &amp; Mary-recruit Tim Rusthoven on their side. \nRusthoven was the focus of Benet's defensive strategy. As the Redwings point guard Dave Sobolewski said, \"We knew that we wouldn't be able to take him out of the game with just a single guy.

In a test on Thursday the \"Airborne Laser Testbed\" (ALTB), a modified Boeing 747-400F, detected a boosting short-range missile and tracked it using a low-energy laser. A second low-energy laser was used to measure and compensate for atmospheric disturbance, before the aircraft's High Energy Laser was used to destroy the target.\nThe missile was liquid-fuelled and said to be \"threat-representative\", possibly similar to a Scud. It was launched from sea, and shot down by the ALTB within two minutes. In a second test less than an hour later, a solid-fuel missile launched from a ground location was also successfully hit by the High Energy Laser, but deliberately not destroyed. A similar missile was destroyed on February 3.\nIn a press release announcing the successful tests the Missile Defense Agency said: \"The revolutionary use of directed energy is very attractive for missile defense, with the potential to attack multiple targets at the speed of light, at a range of hundreds of kilometers, and at a low cost per intercept attempt compared to current technologies.\"\nThe ALTB is described as a \"pathfinder\" for the use of directed energy in missile defense. It is designed to operate at high altitudes above the clouds, and to detect and destroy ballistic missiles soon after launch whilst they are still in their boosting phase. The aircraft is provided by Boeing, the main laser by Northrop Grumman, and the control systems by Lockheed Martin.\n\"Through its hard work and technical ingenuity, the government-industry team has produced a breakthrough with incredible potential,\" stated Greg Hyslop, vice president of Boeing Missile Defense Systems. He said that the experiment had \"made history\". \nThe US has been working on the program since 1996, and has faced numerous problems in that time. The megawatt-class High Energy Laser is known as the chemical oxygen iodine laser (COIL), and consists of six modules, each as large as an SUV. The sheer weight of chemicals needed was almost too much for the 747 jet. The laser also had problems with accuracy due to atmospheric conditions.\nFebruary's tests were originally scheduled to be carried out in 2002. The amount spent getting the project to this stage has also risen from a planned US$1 billion to $7.3 billion. Last year, Secretary of Defense Robert Gates cut the program back to a single jet for research, suggesting it would not see actual deployment.\n\u201cThe reality is that you would need a laser something like 20 to 30 times more powerful than the chemical laser in the plane right now to be able to get any distance from the launch site to fire,\u201d Gates told Congress. \"So, right now the [jet] would have to orbit inside the borders of Iran in order to be able to try and use its laser to shoot down that missile in the boost phase.\"\nGates also raised concerns at the large number of planes that would be required, and the ensuing cost. However, he said that directed energy weapons still had potential for missile defense."}

The group were able to carry out purchases using a card, even without knowing the associated personal identification number (PIN), by using a \"man-in-the-middle\" attack.\nRetail terminals at the point of sale require the cardholder to insert their card and enter their secret PIN before a transaction can be authorised. They then communicate with the microchip built in to the card itself, which holds the PIN. If the correct number has been given, this chip returns a standard verification code (0x9000) to the terminal.\nIn the researchers' attack they inserted a genuine card into a second reader, connected to a laptop. The laptop is linked by thin wires to a fake card, which is inserted into the retailer's terminal. The laptop relays the communications between the terminal and the stolen, but genuine, card, up until the stage where the PIN is to be checked. At this point it intercepts and responds with the verification code, no matter what number was entered. The retailer's terminal then believes that the correct PIN has been entered, and the card can be told that a signature was used to verify the cardholder instead.\nTheir technique has been tested successfully on cards from six different issuers: Bank of Scotland, Barclaycard, Co-operative Bank, Halifax, HSBC and John Lewis.\nThe group say that not much technical skill is required for the attack, and suggested the equipment needed could be kept in a backpack, with the wires to the fake card running down a user's sleeve. They believe the equipment could be miniaturised to the size of a remote control.\n\"In practice how this attack would work is that one reasonably technically skilled person would build a device that carries out the attack and then sell this equipment on the internet just like criminals already do,\" said Dr Steven Murdoch who worked on the project.\nProfessor Anderson claimed that the attack could already be in use by criminals. \"We have many examples of people who have had their cards stolen and then purchases made using the chip and pin,\" he said. \"They are adamant they didn't use it but if the banks say chip and pin has been used you have to pay. I think many of these people would have been victim of the kind of technique we have developed.\"\nHe was scathing about bank claims that the system was secure. \"The banks are wrong. All the banks are lying. They are maliciously and wilfully deceiving the customer. If there was any justice then the police would be looking into this. The system is not fit for purpose.\"\nConsumer group \"Which?\" have also called for an investigation, stating that in a recent survey one in seven people said that money had been taken from their accounts without authorisation. Around half of these did not have the money refunded by the bank.\n\"We want the banks to look into these potential flaws,\" said Cathy Neal from \"Which? Money\", \"because we have had many examples where the banks have said a pin was used and the customer said it hasn't.\"\nOver 90 percent of UK card transactions at point-of-sale use chip and PIN, according to the UK Payments Administration. The attack does not affect ATM transactions, which use different standards. Mark Bowerman, a spokesman for the group which represents card companies, said that there was no evidence the attack was in use and emphasised that card fraud had fallen with the introduction of chip and PIN.\n\"We are taking this paper very seriously, as maintaining excellent levels of card security is paramount,\" he said. \"However, we strongly refute the allegation that chip and PIN is broken.\"\nThe research paper has been made available as a working draft, and is due to be published at the IEEE Security and Privacy Symposium in May 2010. Members of the banking industry were informed of the vulnerability in early December last year."}

They all rely on sales taxes and fares to fund their services, but the recent recession has reduced sales tax revenues, and unemployment has caused ridership to fall. Compared to 86.8 million trips in 2008, Metra reported that only 82.3 million trips were provided in 2009. As spokeswoman Judy Pardonnet said, \"We're looking at any opportunity to increase non-fare revenue.\"\nA law approved by former Illinois governor Rod Blagojevich in 2008 granted free rides to all seniors regardless of income, adding to the decreasing fare revenues as well. State lawmakers are trying to restrict the free rides to low-income seniors; Metra has not yet commented on the issue, however.\u00a0\nNew designs put on the agency's website last September has attracted more traffic, and Metra is considering selling advertising space online. In addition, advertising space could be sold on the outside of train cars as well. As for the naming rights to stations and routes, Metra plans to hire a consultant that would figure out the details of such a proposal. Spokesperson Meg Reihle did not know how much money Metra could gain from the sale or which organizations would be interested in buying.\u00a0\nAccording to Ms. Reihle, public transit agencies in other cities have sold naming rights as well, such as the Greater Cleveland Regional Transit Authority in Cleveland and Long Island Rail Road in Long Island. TECO Energy sponsors a rail line in Tampa's Hillsborough Area Regional Transit for US$1 million over ten years.\u00a0\nThroughout its 26-year history, Metra has named several of its locomotives and renamed two stations: Ogilvie Transportation Center, which was previously named North Western Station, and Millennium Terminal, which was previously called Randolph Street. No transactions were made in renaming those two stations, however. There is also a Station named after the candy maker Mars, but that station was named before Metra took it over, and the company doesn't pay Metra for any naming rights.\u00a0\nExecuive Director Phil Pagano sees the proposal as a way for businesses to advertise themselves. \"I think the business community recognizes that transit is positive for their advertising benefit,\" said Mr. Pagano at a board meeting. In addition to businesses, hospitals located near the train stations could purchase naming rights as well. However, Mr. Pagano has also stated that \"the agency would be selective about the type of businesses it partners with.\"\nMetra has said that it will be sensitive to the wishes of the communities near the stops, and town names will not be removed from station names. Rather, both the municipality and the sponsoring organization would share the naming rights, such as in renaming Naperville Station to \"Naperville Boeing Station\". \"I'm not sure whether [the old name] is first or second, but definitely it's going to have to be there,\" said Mr. Pagano."}

The site takes its information from posts by users on Twitter who have revealed their address and say when they are not at home.\nThe information is displayed by copies of posts by Twitter users on a live feed on the website's front page. Most the posts divulge an address, as well as a comment indicating the person is not at home. A reporter for Wikinews estimated about twenty to thirty new posts, called \"opportunities\" by the website, to be added to the list every minute.\nBoy Van Amstel, one of the developers, commented to the BBC: \"It started with me and a friend looking at our Twitter feeds and seeing more and more posts. People were checking in at their house, or their girlfriend's or friend's house, and sharing the address - I don't think they were aware of how much they were sharing.\"\nThe website reportedly took only four hours to create and put up. \"It's basically a Twitter search - nothing new. Anyone who can do HTML and Javascript can do this. You could almost laugh at how easy it is,\" Van Amstel commented.\nThe developer noted that he does not intend the site to become an aid to burglars. \"The website is not a tool for burglary. The point we're getting at is that not long ago it was questionable to share your full name on the internet. We've gone past that point by 1000 miles,\" he remarked, adding it would be \"very difficult\" in practice to commit a burglary solely with the information provided.\nA statement on the website in question reads: \"The danger is publicly telling people where you are. This is because it leaves one place you're definitely not ... home. So here we are; on one end we're leaving lights on when we're going on a holiday, and on the other we're telling everybody on the internet we're not home.\"\nIt continued: \"It gets even worse if you have 'friends' who want to colonize your house. That means they have to enter your address, to tell everyone where they are. The goal of this website is to raise some awareness on this issue and have people think about how they use services like Foursquare, Brightkite, Google Buzz etc. Because all this site is, is a dressed up Twitter search page. Everybody can get this information.\""}

He then drove to Georgetown Municipal Airport, approximately 20 miles away, took off and then crashed his private plane into the Echelon complex.\nThe Federal Aviation Authority indicated the light aircraft was a Piper Cherokee PA-28, as did news reports and eye witnesses. The FAA said the plane had no flight plan and was under Visual Flight Rules.\nMr. Stack committed suicide, and a suicide note has been located. Mr. Stack's suicide note mentions anti-government and anti-corporate ideals, as well as problems with the Internal Revenue Service and that he lost money in the Enron scandal. Although the incident was intentional, a Department of Homeland Security official said that terrorism is not suspected. The online host of the note, T35 Hosting, later removed it in its entirety after the FBI requested its censorship. However, \"Wikinews\" has preserved the full text of the letter.\nAustin Fire Department reported around 1100 local time (1600 UTC) that two people were transported to local hospitals and one was unaccounted for. One man was admitted at a local hospital under serious condition for smoke inhalation. The other man suffered from second-degree burns on 25% of his back and has been transported by helicopter to Brooke Medical Center in San Antonio and is said to be in stable condition.\nThe seven-story Echelon Building One is located on 9430 Research Boulevard and contains Internal Revenue Service offices. The Echelon building complex houses a number of federal offices, including Central Intelligence Agency and Federal Bureau of Investigation. Research Boulevard is the service road of U.S. Route 183. The incident has caused severe backups on both Research Boulevard and Route 183. \nA witness told \"The Austin Statesman\" that he saw the plane flying lower than usual, then it made a sharp turn and hit the building.\nAn Austin County EMS official, James Shamard, said that smoke is visible from at least a mile from the crash site. Another official for the Austin Fire Department said that two persons who were working in the building are still unaccounted for.\n\"MSNBC\" reports that there was some form of domestic dispute between Mr. Stack and his wife before the incident. He then reportedly used gasoline to light his house on fire. When the fire department arrived, they rescued his wife and teenage daughter. \nAccording to Jerry Cullen, a pilot and former flight instructor who witnessed the crash, the plane was traveling at high speed at time of impact."}

Among these were tax fraud and lying to Bush administration officials during his unsuccessful nomination for US Secretary of Homeland Security in 2004.\nThis sentence is contrary to a plea agreement made in November between Kerik's legal counsel and the prosecution. Per this accord, federal attorneys recommended a sentence of no longer than 33 months in prison, opposed to the 48 months that US District Judge Stephen Robinson (who was not bound to this agreement) chose to hand down instead. \n\"I think it's fair to say that with great power comes great responsibility and great consequences,\" Judge Robinson said upon sentencing. \"I think the damage caused by Mr. Kerik is in some ways immeasurable.\"\n\"Today's sentencing of Bernard Kerik is one of the most powerful recent reminders that no one in this country is above the law,\" added US Attorney Preet Bharara.\nKerik, who was accompanied by his wife and three children, briefly addressed the court: \"I make no excuses. I take full responsibility for the grave mistakes I've made. Believe me when I say I have learned from this and I have become and will continue to become a better person.\"\n\"I know I must be punished,\" he went on to say. \"I only ask that you allow me to return to my wife and two little girls as soon as possible.\"\nAccording to the New York City Department of Corrections, Kerik is slated to begin serving his sentence on May 17. Although the prosecution made clear their desire for Kerik to be imprisoned immediately, Judge Robinson allowed him to surrender himself later in the day so that he would have sufficient time to \"get his affairs in order.\" Kerik has been awaiting sentencing under house arrest at his home in Franklin Lakes, New Jersey since November when said plea agreement was reached. \nKerik, a military veteran and undercover detective, was a trusted advisor to former US Attorney and Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, for whom he worked for as a bodyguard and a driver. \nKerik later served as both corrections and police commissioner. His distinguished actions following the 2001 September 11th Attacks transformed him into a respected national figure. This earned him the praise of then-president George W. Bush, who in turn nominated him for the lead Homeland Security post. It was during the vetting process that Kerik's suspected ties to organized crime came out. This marked the beginning of his long fall from grace. \nOutside the courthouse, Kerik gave a statement to the media and general public before being driven home: \"I'd like to apologize to the American people for the mistakes I have made and for which I have just accepted responsibility. As history is written, I can only hope that I will be judged for the 30 years of service I have given to this country and the City of New York. It has not and will not diminish my love for this country.\"\nKerik's lawyer, when asked by The New York Times if they planned to appeal this sentence, simply replied, \"No comment.\" "}
