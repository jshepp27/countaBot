If approved by a US District Court judge, this will end the lawsuit against the County that stems from allegations that the law, if enforced, is a violation of the 1st and 14th Amendments of the US Constitution. \nIn California, the voters have the ability to propose laws at general elections subject to certain restrictions. In 2006, a group called Democracy Unlimited (DU) sponsored a ban on political contributions from non local corporations. DU was able to acquire the signatures necessary to qualify the measure and it was listed on the ballot as Measure T. \nDespite it qualifying for the ballot, many individuals campaigned against it. They argued that it was unconstitutional. Opponents pointed out that in order for a corporation to be considered local, everything about it must be based in Humboldt County. However, unions, which tend to be corporations, only needed one member in the County. Opponents drew upon the 1st and 14th Amendments to support their contentions, arguing that since corporations have been held as persons, the measure infringes on free speech, and that since the measure gives preference to some corporations and not others, it violates the Equal Rights provisions of the 14th Amendment. \nNotwithstanding these arguments, the measure was passed easily at the polls. Earlier this year, the Pacific Legal Foundation sued the County on the behalf of Mercer-Fraser and O&amp;M, two companies that did business locally, but did not meet the local corporation standard. The lawsuit sought a preliminary injunction against enforcement on the grounds that it was most likely unconstitutional. Judge Susan Illston granted the motion for an injunction in September, agreeing with the plaintiffs that the measure as written was most likely a violation of the 1st and 14th Amendments. According to county officials, this settlement was prompted by an assessment of the merits of continuing litigation and the costs that such litigation would entail. The settlement would declare Measure T null and void and unconstitutional. Additionally, the County would be required to pay $44,000 in legal fees to Pacific Legal Foundation. \nSupporters of Measure T expressed disappointment accusing the county of caving to corporate pressure and not utilizing available resources. County officials have stated that the only reason why they fought the suit was because the measure was a voter initiative, that the costs of litigation would be high, and the end result would most likely remain the same."}

The transplant was performed as part of a treatment for his leukemia.\nThe unnamed man received the marrow from a donor who had a very rare genetic mutation which doctors say leaves a person almost 100% immune to AIDS and the virus that causes it. After radiation treatment for his cancer, and treatments involving several types of AIDS medications, the transplant was performed. As a result of the transplant, the man appears to have been cured of AIDS.\nDr. Gero H\u00fctter, a doctor at Medical University of Berlin, Germany, presented his findings in a paper earlier in the year titled \"Treatment of HIV-1 Infection by Allogeneic CCR5-\u039432/\u039432 Stem Cell Transplantation: A Promising Approach\". In the report, H\u00fctter and his team stated that the man was free of AIDS in just under 70 days. The American Foundation for AIDS Research stated in September during a conference that the man was \"functionally cured\" of AIDS. \n\"High active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) was stopped from day of transplantation. GvHDprophylaxis followed standard regimens and engraftment was achieved on day +13. Complete chimerismas detected by competitive PCR was observed on day +60. The virus load was measured both by RNA-PCR and proviralDNA-PCR. DNA-PCR was negative from day +68 (Table 1),\" stated H\u00fctter in his report. H\u00fctter is not an AIDS specialist.\n\"In the past, the attempts to prolong survival during HIV-1 disease by stem cell transplantation failed. Here, we demonstrate the first successful allogeneic stem cell transplantation in an HIV+ patient\", added H\u00fctter.\nOnly 1% of people in Europe have the mutation to stop the receptor module CCR5, a vital component that helps HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, enter healthy cells. The mutation allows CCR5 to be blocked, along with virtually any other strain of HIV, leaving the individual immune to the virus and AIDS. At least 80 people were tested for the mutation, and only one, the 61st person, was found to have the mutated genes inherited from both parents. The transplant gave the man new and healthy cells, which stopped his infection in its tracks.\nNow, two years after his transplant, the man has been free of the illness and did not take any medication for AIDS in that period. Doctors said the medicine could interfere with the new cells ability to reproduce and survive. The man would only be ordered to start taking medication if his AIDS had reappeared, but it didn't.\nOne doctor says that more tests need to be done in order to determine if similar stem cell treatments can be used on other AIDS patients.\n\"A lot more scrutiny from a lot of different biological samples would be required to say it's not present,\" said Mayo Clinic AIDS immunology researcher Dr. Andrew Badley.\nAccording to the \"Medical Hypotheses\" journal, between the years of 1982 and 1996, at least 32 patients received similar treatments. Of them, only two are reported to have been cured of AIDS. H\u00fctter said he read the report in 1996 and after doing so, he decided to try the treatment. \nBone marrow transplants kill nearly 30% of those who receive them and are very difficult to perform."}

All nine on board, including Interior Minister Juan Camilo Mourino, and five on the ground were killed.\nAs well as Mourino, anti-drug advisor Jose Luis Santiago Vasconcelos died in the wreck, leading to speculation of murder. There have been rumours the jet may have been sabotaged or bombed, but both of these have been ruled out, as have mechanical failure.\nTo try to prevent conspiracy theories, there has been unusual openness to the press over the accident. The investigation is being led by Mexico, who have been joined by teams from Britain and the United States.\nInstead, the readout from the Cockpit Voice Recorder (CVR) coupled with the knowledge that the aircraft had come in too close behind another suggest the likely cause to be an encounter with wake turbulence - dangerously unstable air left behind by an aircraft as it passes through an area. The Learjet came within 4.15 nautical miles of a Boeing 767-300 on the same approach towards Mexico City International Airport, whereas for safety there should have been around 5 nautical miles of separation between the two.\nIt has also been revealed that air traffic control instructed the accident aircraft's flight crew to slow down to keep back from the airliner, but that this had not happened. The pilots may have lacked adequate training, as they are reported to have experienced difficulties and unfamiliarity with the plane's controls. The CVR transcript reveals that the pilots were aware they had hit severe turbulence immediately prior to the crash.\n\"Wow, check out this turbulence!\" pilot Martin Oliva exclaimed to co-pilot Alvaro Sanchez. Apparently panic-stricken, he then asks \"Alvaro, what should we do, Alvaro?\" and is told \"Give it [control of the aircraft] to me, give it to me, give it to me!\" Sanchez then says simply \"God.\" \nIt was to be his last word.

But I think we can do it realistically by early summer.\" \nThe machine operates at temperatures colder than outer space and must be gradually warmed up for experts to assess the damage, causing much of the delay.

He is scheduled to give another phone-in address from abroad on December 14 to supporters at the national Suphachalasai Stadium.\nPeople's Power Party (PPP) MP, and spokesman for the pro-government \"Truth Today\" roadshow Jatuporn Promphan said, \"Thaksin will no longer wait to be attacked, he will fight back by all means, particularly with an eye-for-an-eye strategy, from now on. Thaksin now believes that the only way for him to survive and to live is to fight for his name\".\nCurrently in exile and facing a two year jail term should he return to Thailand, Thaksin informed lawyers from his current residence in Dubai that he would not appeal the conviction for corruption in the Ratchadapisek land deal. While lawyers claim to have prepared the needed paperwork to challenge the conviction, the deadline to do so is today.\nAccording to the \"Bangkok Post\", a return to politics by the ex-PM has caused some concern among PPP government members over the divisions this could cause within the country. Thaksin still enjoys a great deal of support from the rural poor in the country's North-East where the populist policies of his now-outlawed Thai Rak Thai (TRT) party helped win a majority. His most vocal critics, the People's Alliance for Democracy (PAD) have now occupied Government House in Bangkok for over three months.\nThe close association of the ruling PPP with the former premier has given them their own set of problems. The party is actively contesting a case in the country's supreme court that could see it dissolved. The case centres around allegations of vote buying and the party's former deputy leader, Yongyuth Tiyapairat, stands accused of paying village heads for votes. The PPP disputes that this was a party action as opposed to the independent actions of Yongyuth and the other accused. A ruling on the fraud from last December's election is expected soon.\nCritics of the government claim that it is simply a front for the ex-PM and his dissolved party. The yellow-shirted PAD protesters at Government House assert that current Prime Minister, Somchai Wongsawat, Thaksin's brother-in-law, is merely a proxy for the controversial ex-leader.\nProsecution of Thaksin on other charges, which he maintains are politically motivated, continues; the supreme court is expected to hold a hearing next month on accusations that he is 'unusually rich'. This relates to the sale of the family's stake in Shin Corporation to Temasek Holdings, the investment arm of the Singapore government. Assets worth 76 billion baht (US$ 2.2 billion) are currently frozen over this issue. The ex-PM escaped impeachment over the tax-free sale of Shin in February 2006. Thai media reports that an amicable divorce of Thaksin and his wife Pojaman in Hong Kong will have no bearing on the case or asset seizure. Despite the split last week neither can return to Thailand without facing imprisonment; Potjam was earlier successfully prosecuted and given a three year sentence."}

The other two were Madeline Albright and Condoleezza Rice.\nEarlier campaign officials for U.S. president-elect Barack Obama said that Clinton would not be offered or accept the position until after the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday.

Potjaman Shinawatra, step-brother Bannapot Damapong, and her secretary Karnchanapa Honghern were previously found guilty of conspiring to evade taxes in a share transfer deal.\nThailand's Criminal Court ruled in July that the transfer of 4.5 million shares in Shin Computer and Communications (Now Shin Corp) was illegally declared as a family gift, and that the three conspired in the transfer arrangement to evade 546 million Baht (US$15 million) in taxes. Potjaman and her brother Bannapot were sentenced to three years each; her secretary Karnchanapa was sentenced to two years.\nThe 130 page writ of appeal was filed today, citing ten points where the prosecution is contested.

As a result of further cost-cutting measures to keep the show afloat through September 2010, two of the longest-running actors on the serial have had their contracts severed.\nDeidre Hall and Drake Hogestyn, who have played the characters of Marlena Evans and John Black for decades, have taped their final episodes and have been officially released from their obligations at \"Days of our Lives\". When contacted by Wikinews, \"Days\" publicist Daniela Mancinelli commented \"Days of our Lives has decided to rest the characters of 'John Black' and 'Marlena Evans.' After a year of separation, 'John' and 'Marlena' will finally reunite before exiting the canvas in early 2009.\"\nThe surprise renewal of the serial and the high-profile terminations come at an awkward time for the show, because, despite improving on ratings numbers this year and being the only soap opera not to lose viewers, it was highly expected that the series would simply end its run once its contract ran out in March of next year. In early 2007, at a fall preview unveiling for reporters, NBC president Jeff Zucker made a statement indicating that the show would not be renewed past 2009. \nThe renewal was apparently contingent on lowering overall budget numbers, which includes either lowering salaries for actors or terminating them completely. One actor, Jay Kenneth Johnson, who plays the character Philip Kiriakis, left of his own accord earlier this week after being asked to take a voluntary pay cut in exchange for a contract renewal.\nLongtime fans of the series are upset at the cast upheaval, with \"The Tampa Tribune\" noting loud fan protest on message boards devoted to the drama series. The \"New York Daily News\" told readers that next week there will be more news about the current budget situation facing the series, and more potential cast layoffs to be announced. \"Days\" publicist Daniela Mancinelli, after being contacted by Wikinews, said that she does not comment on the status of actors' contracts."}

The American Automobile Association (AAA) reports local, state, and national averages daily, and Friday's findings show that the national average for a gallon of unleaded gasoline is now at $1.989 cents, free-falling from the record high of $4.114 a gallon reached on July 17. Friday also marks the 64th straight day in which retail prices for gasoline have fallen.\nThe sharp drop in prices does not automatically translate into more driving trips for Americans, however. Next week's Thanksgiving holiday, traditionally one of the most traveled holidays of the year, will see a decline in drivers on American roads. 41 million people are expected to drive at least 50 miles for Thanksgiving, a decline of 1.4% from the previous year and the first decline since 2002, while the economy was still shaky after the September 11 terrorist attacks.\nThe drop in gasoline prices has correlated with the free-fall in the price of crude oil, resting below $50 a barrel from a peak of $147 in July. With the world coming to grips with the beginnings of a recession, low gas prices are not translating to freer spending habits or to discarding ideas for hybrid and electric cars. \nDespite falling gas prices, the mood was muted at this week's Los Angeles Auto Show. Ford introduced a modified version of their hybrid Fusion automobile, amid reports from Capitol Hill calling the Big 3 automakers \"out of touch\" with today's necessities, and BMW unveiled an all-electric car called the Mini E. \nPeter Beutel, president of the energy risk management firm Cameron Hanover, believes national gas prices will bottom out around $1.75. \"I think in some of these very low-cost areas like New Jersey or Texas, you might even see it come down to $1.65,\" he said.

The earlier attack prompted planning for a rally and march on parliament tomorrow where the PAD aims to try and topple the current People's Power Party (PPP) government.\nAccording to Thailand's English-language paper, \"The Nation\", doctors have stated that one of those injured in the blast is brain dead. Anupong Samerphak, one of the PAD security staff, was hit in the body and neck by shrapnel from the grenade and remains on a respirator.\nFurther details of \"The Nation's\" report state that eyewitnesses claim two teenagers made use of a grenade launcher to carry out the attack before making their escape on a motorcycle. In addition to the eight casualties, two pick-up trucks, a car, and a motorcycle were damaged; the blast left a crater near the Fifth gate of the Government House compound.\nThe anti-government PAD protesters have now been occupying the Government House compound for over three months, demanding the dissolution of the government of Prime Minister Somchai Wongsawat. They assert that the PPP is acting on behalf of deposed former premier Thaksin Shinawatra, whose populist Thai Rak Thai (lit. Thais love Thais) government was overthrown by a military coup in 2006 and later outlawed. Both Somchai and his predecessor in the post of PM, Samak Sundaravej, have faced fierce criticism from the yellow-shirted protest movement. Samak was forced out of office in September, with Somchai, Thaksin's brother-in-law, acting as caretaker until officially assuming the office later in September.\nThe embattled current PM, Somchai, expressed fears to journalists over the planned PAD protest for tomorrow and Monday. Speaking in Peru, where he is attending an APEC summit, he highlighted the possibility of the demonstrations impeding the passage of 24 new laws related to the country's involvement in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). Delegations from other nations attending the APEC summit have expressed surprise that Thailand has not taken action to dislodge the protesters from Government House."}

The two girls, ages 16 and 14, were removed from the compound along with four other girls in a September 20 raid conducted by state, federal law enforcement officials and FBI. Authorities raided the compound while investigating allegations of physical and child sexual abuse.\nThe controversial evangelist leader of the organization, Tony Alamo, 74, was himself arrested on September 25 in Flagstaff, Arizona on charges of sexually abusing children and allegedly transporting a young girl across state lines in order to commit sexual acts with her - a violation of the Mann Act. He waived extradition from Arizona to Arkansas. Alamo has previously been convicted on charges of tax evasion. He was born as Bernie Hoffmann, and started the Tony and Susan Alamo Christian Foundation in 1969 with his wife Susan.\nTexas Human Services caseworkers took another 20 children into custody on Tuesday in investigations into properties controlled by the organization in Fouke, Texarkana and Fort Smith, Arkansas. According to Associated Press, nine girls and 11 boys ages 1 to 17 were taken into care of the state Tuesday. The children were given health screenings by the state on Wednesday, and received mental health and education assessments. Department of Human Services spokeswoman Julie Munsell said that the children taken by the state on Tuesday had no signs of poor health, and did not need any pressing medical attention. The children were placed in foster care in Arkansas, and Miller County Circuit Judge Kirk Johnson will convene a hearing Monday to determine if these children should stay in foster care.\nKTBS reported that three of the boys were taken by the state from the courthouse while they were with their parents attending the hearings on the two girls taken September 20. Circuit Judge Joe Griffin gave the order authorizing seizure of the children by the state, on allegations of physical abuse and neglect. Judge Griffin's order found that there was probable cause that other children at the Tony Alamo compound properties were at risk of abuse and neglect, and may have already been abused. According to a report Thursday in the \"Texarkana Gazette\", over one hundred children from the Tony Alamo compound that were part of a court order to be taken into state custody may be outside reach of child welfare services and unaccounted for, if they were taken over state lines. Arkansas State Police searched over 12 locations Tuesday, but no children were found at the Fort Smith location.\nIn a hearing which concluded Friday night, Judge Jim Hudson of Miller County Circuit explained that his ruling was influenced by a recommendation from the Arkansas Department of Human Services. Human Services asserted that girls at the Fouke compound were at risk of sexual abuse, and that beatings were meted out as punishment at the compound. Human Services also alleged that one of the two girls had been a witness to abuse, and that the other was herself subjected to being beaten at the compound. Judge Hudson stated: \"It seems from their recommendation that they don\u2019t see a way that the problems with abuse and neglect could be solved within the context of that very tightly knit community.\" \n\"I am not trying to infringe on their religious practices, only the practices that were found to be neglectful or abuse,\" said Judge Hudson after the hearing had concluded. Judge Hudson made his ruling after hearing three days of testimony regarding the allegations of child abuse at the Tony Alamo compound.\nThe director of the Arkansas chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union, Rita Sklar, stated that she did not have any objections to restrictions on religion, if the welfare of a child was involved. \"It doesn\u2019t sound problematic to keep the children away from what seems to be a very dangerous situation. You do not have a constitutional right to subject your children to sexual abuse because it\u2019s in line with your religious beliefs,\" said Sklar in a statement in the \"Arkansas Democrat Gazette\".\nThe \"Texarkana Gazette\" reported that Tony Alamo released a statement from his jail cell regarding the testimony given this week regarding the allegations of abuse made against him. With regard to claims made by the 14-year-old girl who testified in court that Alamo molested her when she was 12-years-old and living at his house, Alamo stated: \"She\u2019s a liar right out of the pit of hell.\" Alamo went on to state that he was: \"being found guilty without a presumption of innocence ... I have no say in what's going on. This is one-sided and I can't be heard.\" \nAn arrest warrant was issued by Fort Smith police for John Erwin Kolbeck, 49, who allegedly served as an enforcer for Alamo. Kolbeck is accused of beating Alamo's followers for offenses against him and the organization, and Little Rock FBI spokesman Steve Frazier told the AP that a federal warrant for unlawful flight to avoid prosecution was drawn out in the past week for Kolbeck.\nAccording to the AP, the 14-year-old girl testified Monday that Alamo placed his hand over her mouth while she was showering, and then touched her inappropriately. He then threatened her by saying the name of his alleged enforcer Kolbeck. \"He said don\u2019t tell anybody what happened here or I\u2019ll have John (Kolbeck) beat you and I'll take care of you. Nobody would've believed me, anyway. Everybody thinks he's a prophet here,\" stated the 14-year-old girl in court, reported the \"Arkansas Democrat Gazette\".\nJudge Hudson stated that a review of the case is scheduled for February 14 and subsequently every 90 days thereafter in order to assess if the girls' parents are in compliance with the Judge's request. If the parents are seen to be out of compliance, the state may recommend termination of parental rights. Hearings are expected next week with regard to the status of the other four girls that were removed from the compound September 20. Tony Alamo is himself scheduled for trial on February 2."}

Next will be manufacturing, with 11,000 jobs lost, and 7,000 more will go in construction.\n\"Scotland has accepted that a recession is now inevitable.

These include policy actions at a global and UK level, including any fiscal measures announced in the pre-Budget report, and the fall in oil and commodity prices. The sharp decline in inflation that is in the pipeline will buoy disposable incomes and leaves an open door to further interest rate cuts. Finally, the UK will also benefit from the sharp fall in sterling that is unlikely to be frittered away by wage inflation. However, recovery critically depends on both the willingness of the banking system to extend credit and the readiness of businesses and consumers to use it.\" \nIn 2010, he predicts Scottish growth to recover by 1.5%, with the rest of the UK gaining only 1%.

The engineers then shut down two of the nine engines \u2014 in order to limit potential damage to the launch pad \u2014 and continued the test for 18 more seconds before finally shutting the rocket down. \"We ran the engines just like they would run during flight, but instead of being up in the air, they were held down. They weren\u2019t moving,\" said Lauren Dreyer, SpaceX's manager for business development. This was the Falcon 9's first major test firing, and it marks a milestone for the company in its plans to capture a section of the commercial launch market.\nThe test reportedly shook the windows of houses 5 miles away, causing agitation among residents who felt that they had not received adequate warning. \"I appreciate the fact that the company notified [the City of] McGregor, but did they not think the test would affect the surrounding communities?\" asked commenter Lorena Resident on the website for the Waco Tribune-Herald. Waco lies just east of McGregor.\nThe Falcon 9 rocket, and its smaller sibling the Falcon 1, are the first rockets capable of entering (LEO) to have their design be privately funded in its entirety. According to SpaceX the Falcon 9 can generate 4 times the maximum thrust of a while firing in a vacuum, and will eventually be able to perform interplanetary missions in addition to its initial role as an orbital launch vehicle. SpaceX is also designing a crew and cargo capsule for the Falcon 9, which it has named the \"\".\nSpaceX is a contender for future commercial contracts from various government run space agencies, with NASA expressing particular interest. NASA will be retiring their fleet of Columbia Class in 2010, but will not have the Shuttles' replacements (the and rockets) ready until at least 2014. NASA hopes to fill some of this gap using commercial launches from companies such as SpaceX. SpaceX has already reached an agreement with NASA to conduct three test flights of the Dragon capsule in conjunction with the Falcon 9. The first of these flights is expected in 2009.\nElon Musk, CEO and CTO of SpaceX, said, \"The full mission-length test firing clears the highest hurdle for the Falcon 9 first stage before launch. In the next few months, we will have the first Falcon 9 flight vehicle on its launch pad at Cape Canaveral, preparing for lift-off in 2009.\"\nExternal Links.\nSpaceX video of launch test"}

In moving into the second day of blockades and protests, they have expanded their operations to disrupt government business.\nTaksin (not to be confused with the fugitive ex-PM Thaksin Shinawatra) was an 18th century Siamese monarch noted for his prowess in warfare, the unification of Thailand, and expelling Burmese influence. One tale of his exploits details ordering rice bowls to be broken before a battle, the implication being his troops would not eat until victory was achieved. Within Thailand he is known as 'Taksin the Great', and the association the PAD is trying to make is in line with their claim to be pro-monarchy.\nPAD protesters had begun massing on Sunday, and yesterday morning they besieged the parliament building, forcing the joint MP and Senate sessions to be cancelled. A call for a parallel strike by public sector workers met with apathy; it had been hoped this would further disrupt the running of the country and help bring down the People's Power Party (PPP) government of Somchai Wongsawat.\nWith parliament out of action, PAD protesters began targeting additional offices of the government. Key among these is the temporary home of the cabinet, Don Mueang, the old Bangkok international airport. The government has been operating out of some of the mothballed buildings at the airport since the PAD seized the main Government House compound and buildings in late August.\nThe government asserts that the constitutional changes which the PAD is vehemently opposed to were not on the agenda for Monday's session. Instead Association of South East Asian (ASEAN) related legislation was to be discussed. As the current chair of ASEAN, concern has been expressed that Thailand may lose face if unable to ratify a variety of treaties at the upcoming meeting in Chiang Mai, north Thailand. The protesters have vowed to disrupt parliamentary sessions until it goes into recess, or the government stands down.\nIn the aftermath of last month's clashes, where two protesters were killed when police used tear gas, the authorities have avoided any confrontation that could turn violent. When protesters massed at parliament, police allowed them to lay siege to the empty building. Similarly, the protest outside the old international airport has been unimpeded. Measures are in place to prevent occupation of the buildings, but no clashes have occurred. Operation of domestic flights from other parts of the airport have continued without disruption although travellers have been warned to allow extra time getting to the airport due to traffic congestion.\nMeanwhile, the PAD's arch-nemesis, the deposed ex-premier Thaksin Shinawatra, has stated his intention to return to Thai politics and condemned the UK government for revoking his visa. In an interview with Abu Dhabi's \"Arabian Business\", Thaksin stated, \"With me at the helm I can bring confidence quickly back to Thailand. We have to find a mechanism under which I can go back, that is why I must tell you that I will go back into politics.\" The full interview is due to be published this Sunday.\nHe bemoaned the decision of the British government to cancel his visa; now in self-imposed exile and facing a two year prison sentence, should he return to Thailand, he is believed to be staying in Dubai. According to \"The Bangkok Post\", the UK decision now makes him a wanted man on the run."}

Her body was found two days later, on Allington Lane in West End, a village just outside the city.\nAccording to court records, Hannah had spent the evening with friends just a short distance from the family home in Portswood and was snatched by Kohli just yards away from her house. She was able to call 999, the emergency services line, hoping that the operator would hear what was happening. However, with nobody actually on the line an automatic system led the call to be terminated. After dumping her body, Kohli went home to his wife and children, before fleeing to India four days later.\nKohli spent sixteen months running from authorities, during which he remarried. Eventually he was arrested in a joint operation between Hampshire Constabulary and Indian police. Shortly thereafter, he gave, then retracted, a televised confession of the murder.\nKohli remained in custody in India while Hilary and Trevor Foster, the victim's parents, campaigned for his extradition to the UK to face trial.

The Prime Minister said it would draw upon its budget surplus to stimulate growth and jobs.\nThe Prime Minister said the Australian economy had changed significantly over the past few months and warned that there were hard times to come for many people. Mr Rudd said the situation will worsen before it gets any better.\nMr Rudd said that the government will go into temporary deficit and spend on infrastructure to stimulate growth if required and not to do so would be irresponsible.\n\"If Australian economic growth slows further because of a further deepening of the global crisis then it follows that Australian Government revenues will reduce further,\" he said.\n\"Under those circumstances, it would be responsible to draw further from the surplus and if necessary to use a temporary deficit to begin investing in future infrastructure needs including hospitals, schools, TAFEs, universities, ports, roads, urban rail and high speed broadband.\" He added, \"Such action would support growth would support families and jobs and would be undertaken in the national interest.\" \nIf the budget fell into deficit, it would be first time the federal budget has gone into deficit since 2001.

It is now sweeping across the world from China to Chile, from Germany to Japan.\"\nThe government slashed its budget surplus forecast earlier this month by AUD15 billion to $5.1 billion and revised down revenue for the next four years by a further $40 billion. Mr Rudd blamed part of the downgrade to falling commodity prices.\nFigures recently released by the OECD predict that Australia will manage to avoid a recession this year; economic growth is predicted to be 1.7%.\nOpposition leader Malcolm Turnbull used the Prime Minister's announcement to attack the Rudd government's economic credentials. He said any deficit would be regarded by voters to be a failure in economic management.\nMr Turnbull asserted that it is unlikely that any deficit would be temporary. \"Experience and history tell us that Labor deficits are never temporary,\" he told parliament. \"The last Labor deficit lasted for six years.

Police have been ordered to end the blockade and demonstrations, prompting the PAD to move demonstrators inside terminal buildings and post volunteer guards to fend off any action by authorities.\nThe staunchly royalist and anti-government protesters began upping the stakes in their campaign to bring down the populist PPP government last Sunday. A rallying call for protesters to mass at the occupied Government House compound on Sunday saw thousands ready for their Monday morning march on parliament. Since forcing the cancellation of sessions of both houses of parliament, the protesters have expanded their targets to include temporary government offices at Don Mueang, and then to close both of Bangkok's international airports.\nDisruption by the PAD has now been in progress for over three months. The group which initially demonstrated in 2006 leading to a bloodless military coup to overthrow the now-fugitive ex-PM Thaksin Shinawatra claims the current government is corrupt and merely a proxy for Thaksin, who remains in self-imposed exile. The current escalation of action has been dubbed their 'final battle' and although army commanders have dismissed reports that a second coup may be imminent, rumours that such may happen abound.\nThe PAD action is now starting to have a notable impact on Thailand's economy. Most apparent is the impact on the tourism industry with several countries advising their nationals not to fly into the country; Tuesday's invasion and closure of the new international airport saw 3,000 - 4,000 travelers stranded in terminal buildings. Normally handling around 75 flights an hour, Suvarnabhumi airport's closure is estimated to be costing the agriculture sector of the country's economy 3 billion baht (US$85 million) per day. As a major segment of the economy, the export by air of fresh fruit and vegetables is among Thailand's better known products.\nAmong the would-be travelers, the nearly 5,000 Thai Muslims who planned to make the annual Hajj pilgrimage are most distressed. Pridi Chueaphudee, an advisor to the leader of the country's Islamic community, has appealed for the PAD to permit pilgrims to fly out of the new international airport. According to the \"Bangkok Post\" there is concern that the blockade may send a message of religious intolerance to Saudi Arabia. Thai Airways have managed to arrange one chartered flight from Hat Yai International Airport to Jeddah, although this will only accommodate 250 of those seeking to attend the Hajj.\nMeanwhile, the beleaguered Prime Minister Somchai remains in his home town of Chiang Mai in the north of the country. He was forced to divert there when returning from an APEC summit in Peru, and has set no date for his return to the capital. With concern that a coup may be in the offing, cabinet business is being conducted via video conferences with other senior government officials who are in Bangkok. He has dismissed calls from the military for the current government to be dissolved and fresh elections held.\nWith police apparently determined to avoid a repeat of the October 7 clashes that left two dead and around 500 injured, it may be the involvement of government supporters that tips the current crisis into violent confrontation. The pro-government United Front for Democracy Against Dictatorship (UDD) has called for their supporters to disperse PAD occupation of the airports should the government fail to act."}

The blockade of the two main international airports by People's Alliance for Democracy (PAD) supporters is now in its sixth day. Tensions continue to rise with a pro-government rally planned for today and police surrounding the main international airport, Suvarnabhumi.\nWith the old international airport, Don Mueang, still in PAD hands, the red-shirted pro-government United Front of Democracy Against Dictatorship (UDD) has supporters massing at the Bangkok city hall. A \"Truth Today\" talk show is planned for later on, although it is unclear if the fugitive ex-PM Thaksin Shinawatra will feature. Organisers have indicated there are no plans to confront the PAD, but non-specific threats to act where the government has not done so have been made in the past.\nThailand's Prime Minister remains in Chiang Mai in the north of the country, having declared a state of emergency around the two besieged airports on Friday. The announcement prompted the PAD to move protesters inside terminal buildings and post volunteer guards. Moves by police yesterday to evict the protesters failed, and their vehicles were seized as they retreated. The police presence around the airport has been stepped up as today has gone on and Navy and Air Force personnel may be made available to assist in clearing the protesters.\nAdding to calls from the army for the beleaguered People's Power Party (PPP) government to resign, the Thai Chamber of Commerce labelled the administration as incompetent and called for them to step down; some Chamber of Commerce members made the suggestion that businesses should cease paying taxes if the request is ignored.\nThe deepening three-month old political crisis continues to have significant economic impact on Thailand. Agriculture is hard hit because the export of fresh produce via air is usually routed through the Suvarnabhumi airport. No new tourists are entering the country; many nations have advised their citizens not to travel to Bangkok, and the repercussions in the tourist industry are expected to last well into 2009. A report in \"The Bangkok Post\" suggests that as many as one million in the industry could lose their jobs. In a press conference at the Foreign Ministry, Deputy Prime Minister Olarn Chaipravat highlighted the plight of the hotel, tour, and restaurant trades - expected to be hardest hit in the wake of the crisis.\nPolice appear reluctant to make forceful moves to remove the protesters from the two airports, likely a consequence of their last clash with the anti-government PAD in October that saw two protesters killed and around 500 injured. Suggestions have been made that action is being deferred pending a decision by the country's constitutional court on the future of Prime Minister Somchai's PPP. The party may be outlawed this coming week in light of allegations of vote buying in the last general election. The court may face pressure from the pro-government UDD, their city hall rally is only minutes away from the court buildings. This means that they could surround the premises to protest the court moving to closing statements and a verdict on the fate of the parties in the ruling coalition.\nThe PAD demonstrators encamped at Government House saw another grenade attack on Saturday night. Fifty are reported injured in the attack, and separate explosions are reported at Sondhi Limthongkul's ASTV satellite TV station and the occupied Don Mueang airport."}

Patil submitted his resignation to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, which was later accepted by the President of India. It was the first political reverberation that was felt in the UPA-led government of India. \nFinance Minister of India P. Chidambaram has been appointed the successor of Patil. Prime Minister of India Manmohan Singh would be handling the finance ministry now. Chidambaram has earlier served in internal security under the administration of Rajiv Gandhi in late 1980s. On Sunday, an all-party meeting was also convened by the Prime Minister to discuss the Mumbai attacks and evolve a consensus within all political parties on how to combat terror.\nShivraj Patil was already facing stiff criticism from Indian media and India's main political opposition party (BJP). The key allies, such as Rashtriya Janata Dal of the ruling Indian National Congress, had already begun to raise voices for the home minister's resignation. The inefficiency of India's security and intelligence agencies to protect the people against a series of terror attacks in the past six months was one reason for Patil's resignation.\nPatil's resignation comes after the Congress Working Committee (CWC) met, in which Sonia Gandhi had made it clear by expressing unhappiness over the terrorist incidents taking place at regular intervals. The meeting was hostile towards Patil, as many other Union ministers spoke against him. \nChief Minister of Maharashtra Vilasrao Deshmukh had also come under fire in the meeting. Indian media agencies have reported that he would soon follow Patil and may have to resign under pressure. The Minister of State in the office of Prime Minister (PMO) Prithviraj Chavan is reported to become the chief minister if the Congress party high command decides to replace Deshmukh.\nPatil was a former Speaker of Lok Sabha but had lost the 2004 parliamentary election from Latur constituency in Maharashtra. His proximity with Congress president Sonia Gandhi managed to get him elected to Rajya Sabha in July 2004. In 2007, Patil was a serious contender for the post of president after A P J Abdul Kalam retired.\nMeanwhile, the Indian government is considering to stall the five-year old cease-fire with Pakistan and to end the dialogue process in order to send strong diplomatic signals.

Red-shirted pro-government protesters were dismayed at the court's decision. Initially they blockaded the Constitutional Court buildings to try and prevent the case being heard; following its relocation they moved on to the Administrative Court to protest a decision they claim is anti-democratic.\nIn addition to the PPP being disbanded and outlawed, two other parties in the ruling coalition were found guilty. The Chart Thai and Matchimathipataya parties were also outlawed and, between the three parties, 109 members barred from all involvement in the electoral process - including the right to vote. Among those disenfranchised were three ex-Prime Ministers. Those remaining from the executive of the outlawed parties have stated their intention to reform under a new name and attempt to continue in government.\nPrior to the PAD announcing that their airport blockades would end, another grenade attack at one of the airports killed one and injured around 20 other protesters. Yesterday saw the PAD announce plans to abandon the Government House compound they have occupied since August. Following numerous grenade attacks on their encampment there, they elected to move to the airport protest sites and leave what has become a regular target; it is expected to take until Thursday to remove all belongings accumulated at the key site since the August invasion.\nSomchai, brother-in-law to the fugitive ex-PM Thaksin Shinawatra, has been a target of the PAD since he assumed the office following his predecessor being ousted over a conflict of interest issue. The PPP and Somchai are seen as a proxy for Thaksin and his banned Thai Rak Thai party, which the military overthrew in a bloodless coup in 2006."}

A report by the WHO stated that the last large outbreak was in 1992, with 3,000 cases recorded.\nCholera is frequently spread by contaminated, untreated water. The spread of the disease was expedited by the collapse of Zimbabwe's health and sanitation systems; state media reported that most of Harare has been left without water after the city ran out of chemicals for its treatment plant. A resident of Mabvuku, a suburb located east of Harare, told APTV that electricity is not available most of the time, so water is consumed without being boiled first.\nThe medical charity M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (Doctors Without Borders) said that there have been cases of cholera reported in areas of Botswana, Mozambique, and South Africa that border Zimbabwe, indicating the sub-regional threat of the outbreak. The South African ministry of health confirmed that they had 160 incidents of cholera reported, as well as three deaths.\nThe European Commission said that it was providing \u20ac9 million (US$11.4 million) in funds to assist Zimbabwe with the crisis. \"I'm shocked at the deteriorating humanitarian crisis in Zimbabwe and call upon the authorities there to respond quickly to this cholera outbreak by allowing full assistance from international humanitarians and regional partners,\" said the commissioner responsible for the European Union's humanitarian aid, Louis Michel.\nOther agencies providing aid to the country include the United Nations Children's Fund, the WHO, and Doctors Without Borders."}

Several other factors likely contributed to Gulf War Syndrome, including excessive exposure to pesticides, mainly Permethrin and DEET, and chemical weapons residue caused by the American demolition of the Iraqi munitions depot in Khamisiyah. \nThe report estimates that about 1 out of every 4 veterans of the Gulf War are affected by this illness; this could mean anywhere between 175,000 and 210,000 soldiers are affected by the syndrome. The report also concluded that veterans exposed to the toxins spread by the destruction of the munitions depot have died of brain cancer at double the rate of other Gulf War veterans. Other problems associated with the condition are: fatigue, headaches, joint pain, rashes, breathing difficulty, forgetfulness, circulation problems, and cardiac troubles.\nGulf War Syndrome has been the focal point of veterans rights groups since the illness first became noticed in the early 1990s. The United States and British governments claimed that the illness was merely psychological trauma from war misinterpreted as an illness, and veterans could not receive medical coverage for the illness.\n\"I feel vindicated, but I'm angry. This is so long overdue,\" said Denise Nichols, an advocate for veterans' rights and a nurse who served during Operation Desert Storm.

The airliner came down over Lockerbie, Scotland in December 1988, killing 270 people.\nMegrahi is due an appeal against his conviction next year. Also present at the unprecedented \"Silent Walk For Justice\" was the family of Jason MacIntyre, a champion cyclist killed when Robert McTaggart ran him down in a van in January, for which he received a six month driving ban after conviction of careless driving. MacIntyre's wife said McTaggert should have instead been charged with causing death by dangerous driving.\nAlso present was the mother of Luke Mitchell, a 48-year-old convicted in 2005 of the murder of teenager Jodi Jones, his then girlfriend. She carried a poster saying \"miscarriages of justice have no voice\" and says fresh evidence has surfaced that warrants a new appeal and a new legal team has been appointed to represent him.\nThe march was organised by Swede Annie B\u00f6rjesson's mother and her best friend Maria Jansson, who between them campaigned for a fatal accident inquiry after Annie's body was found washed ashore at Prestwick in December 2005. Ms Jansson said the march was an event for people who felt let down by the legal system and not about individual cases, saying \"We are not here to judge each other or measure each other \u2013 we are here because we are humans.\"\nDespite this, around 30 people surrounded Megrahi's wife Aisha and their four sons Khalid, Mohamed, Ali and Moutasim to support them, holding posters with Megrahi on them. The marchers travelled down the Royal Mile to the Scottish Parliament Building, then held a candlelit vigil.\nOutside the building, Mr al-Megrahi's lawyer Tony Kelly read a statement on behalf of Aisha. \"My children and I are here today to give support to my husband, Abdelbaset, who is a victim of a miscarriage of justice and terminally ill, and also to give support to all those other victims of miscarriages of justice,\" it said. \"We are here for the sake of all these innocent souls who are suffering in silence. I would like to thank all those who continue to support him, pray for him and express sympathy with him.\"\nShe also asked for the 'compassionate' people of Scotland to \"consider the suffering of my husband\", saying of him: \"He is an innocent and very ill man who is suffering every day from the psychological and physical stress.

Penn State is the largest university in Pennsylvania and among the ten largest public universities in the United States.\nPennsylvanian James Sheep was charged with driving under the influence on November 22. Cheerleading coach Curt White told the Associated Press that Sheep will return later in 2009. The duration of the suspension was not mentioned.\nSheep was pulled over on campus at 3:16 am November 22, before Penn's game versus Michigan State. He registered a .164 blood alcohol level. Penn State won the game 49-18.\nSheep has avoided interview requests by \"The Daily Collegian\", Penn State's newspaper, on multiple occasions.\nIn a statement, White commented: \"James has been a very enthusiastic and hard-working Nittany Lion, but we are disappointed that his recent actions did not represent the high standards of this position. We are planning to have James resume his duties in the new year and are confident that he will represent Penn State Athletics and the University with a high level of energy, dedication and respect.\"\nThe Pennsylvania State University website lists Sheep on their website as the Lion from 2007-2008, conflicting with coach White's comment that he would return in the new year.\nThe mascot was introduced in 1907, brought in as a costume character in 1921, and is even the subject of the book \"The Nittany Lion: An Illustrated Tale\". While most American university mascots change in appearance over the decades, the Nittany Lion remains essentially the same design as it has for generations.\nSome earlier reports suggested that \"46 current or former Penn State [football] players have been charged with crimes on 163 counts in the past six seasons.\" Of those players charged, 27 were found guilty of at least one charge."}

Gol Transportes A\u00e9reos Flight 1907, a Boeing 737, crashed into the ground after an Embraer Legacy 600 executive jet's wing clipped it. The Legacy, owned by ExcelAire, performed an emergency landing at a nearby airbase. \nThe report says the Legacy's transponder was \"inadvertently turned off by the hand of one of the pilots,\" and says this was the \"central point in a chain of errors\" leading to the collision. Crucially, the transponder failure - which the US pilots have denied causing - prevented the Traffic Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) from functioning.\nThe investigation, which was conducted by the Brazilian Air Force, criticised air traffic control (ATC) on a number of points; the Legacy was not properly advised on the altitude at which it should be cruising, when one controller changed shift there was a miscommunication between them about the Legacy's altitude and there was a failure of communication between the Legacy and ATC.\nThe ExcelAire pilots, Joseph Lepore and Jan Paladino, were only allowed to return home after promising they would return to Brazil if summoned by the courts. The pair, along with four air traffic controllers, have been indicted over the crash and all six face up to three years in prison each.\nThe purpose of this investigation, however, was not to acertain blame but to determine the root causes and suggest measures by which a reccurence can be avoided. Some moves have already been made in the aftermath; the accident was the deadliest in Brazil until TAM Airlines Flight 3054 crashed the following year and both were responsible for the 2006-2007 Brazilian aviation crisis. In response, a major overhaul of the nation's military ATC system is underway.\nExcelAire's executive vice president David Rimmer was critical of the report. \"The transponder issue is a distraction from the true cause of the accident, which is an air traffic control system that put two airplanes on a collision course for about an hour,\" he said. He complained that ATC did not \"recognize the transponder failure and to provide increased separation between the two jets, as required by international aviation regulations.\"\nHe was also concerned by the Air Force's methodology and the conclusions drawn from it. \"We have no proof of how the transponder was turned off and no evidence to suggest it was inadvertently turned off by the pilots,\" he said. \"[The Air Force] relied on theories rather than conducting in-depth testing of the equipment.\"\nThe report's official release is next week, however it has already been seen by Brazilian newspapers, hence making its findings public today."}

The filters appear to be applied because Wikimedia sites are hosting a Scorpions album cover which some call child pornography. Scorpions are a German hard rock band who have used several controversial album covers and are perhaps best known for the song \"Rock You Like a Hurricane\".\nThe measures applied redirect traffic for a significant portion of the UK's Internet population through six servers which can log and filter the content available to the end user. A serious side-effect of this is the inability of administrators on Wikimedia sites to block vandals, and other troublemakers, without potentially impacting hundreds of thousands of innocent UK contributors who work on WMF sites in good faith.\nThe filtering is in response to the Internet Watch Foundation's list of websites that host content reported to contain inappropriate images of naked children. The IWF considers those images child pornography. However, in the United States, where the websites of the Wikimedia Foundation are hosted, it is not considered obscene under the criteria of the Miller test, which requires that an obscene work lack \"serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value\" - as album art is used to \"brand\" the album, it is considered to be artistic.\nContributors or individuals attempting to view an affected image or file, depending on their ISP, may get a warning saying, \"we have blocked this page because, according to the Internet Watch Foundation (IWF), it contains indecent images of children or pointers to them; you could be breaking UK law if you viewed the page.\" Other ISPs provide blank pages, 404 errors, or other means of blocking the content. Due to a configuration mistake at one Internet service provider, some users have reported being totally unable to access Wikimedia sites to the Wikipedia technical help desk.\n\"The Protection of Children Act 1978 as amended in the Sexual Offences Act 2003, makes it an offence to take, make, permit to be taken, distribute, show, possess with intent to distribute, and advertise indecent photographs or pseudo-photographs of children under the age of eighteen. The 'making' of such images includes downloading, that is, making a copy of a child sexual abuse image on a computer, so, in the UK, accessing such content online is a serious criminal offence,\" says the IWF on their website in an article updated on November 28. The IWF say there are at least 800 to 1,200 websites on the list of those who host or contain offensive material. The list is not public and the IWF never notified Wikimedia Foundation about the blocking of Wikipedia content. The affected page does not display any message informing the user about blocked content on most ISPs, instead, a technical error message is shown.\nHowever, Demon Internet redirects users to a block message on the IWF's site explaining that the page was blocked as the organization suspects child porn or links to it to be present. The IWF states that, \"we do not notify site owners that their websites are on our list.\"\nThe concern for Wikimedia is for some images like an album cover from a 1976 record of the Scorpions titled \"Virgin Killer\". It displays an underage girl, posing nude, with a lens crack crossing over her genitals, but nothing blocking out her breasts. The girl appears to be around ten years old. In the U.S., the band later replaced the image with one of the group. The cover was uploaded to \"Wikipedia\" in 2006, but \"Wikinews\" learned that on May 9, 2008 at (21:17 UTC), despite a result of strong consensus to 'keep' in a deletion request, the image was deleted, however for a different reason. It was deleted due to a claim by an administrator that it violated Wikipedia's policy for dealing with copyrighted images, which require that any images used under the doctrine of fair use must alongside other criteria, \"significantly increase readers' understanding of the topic, and its omission would be detrimental to that understanding\", with the administrator claiming that the article \"lacked meaningful discussion\" of the album art. This result was overturned using the deletion review process. Earlier, on December 6, the image was put back up for a deletion request, but it was later closed as Wikimedia \"does not censor\".\nAnother image that is questionable could be a screenshot from the 1938 film \"Child Bride\". Its goal was to bring to light the attempts at banning child marriages. In the article on \"Wikipedia\", a screenshot appears of then 12-year-old Shirley Mills partially naked after skinny dipping. In the photo, at least one of her breasts can be seen.\nOther albums featuring nudity below the age of sixteen have previously caused controversy; \"Blind Faith\" attracted criticism as did \"Houses of the Holy\", and Nirvana's \"Nevermind\".\nMultiple companies have gone public stating that they implement the recommendations of the Internet Watch Foundation. Not all of these are known to have implemented measures against Wikimedia sites; the major UK ISPs thought to have affected Wikimedia sites are Telefonica O2/Be Unlimited, Virgin Media, Easynet, Plusnet, Demon, and Opal Telecommunications (TalkTalk).\n\"Wikinews\" has contacted \"Wikimedia's\" legal counsel, Mike Godwin and the IWF for a statement, but neither have replied as of this time."}

The Mars Science Laboratory was due to launch in 2009, but lift off will now not occur until 2011 because more time was required for tests, causing the rover to miss its launch window. This delay comes just 2 months after the European Space Agency (ESA) delayed their planned ExoMars mission until 2016. Commenting on the delay of the MSL, NASA Administrator Mike Griffin said, \"[t]rying for '09 would require us to assume too much risk, more than I think is appropriate for a flagship mission\".\nThe MSL was due to feature several new technologies, including a hovering platform that would lower the rover onto the surface, and new atmospheric entry methods. Atmospheric entry into Mars has always been a difficult prospect for scientific probes with many probes being lost. The most recent loss was in 2003: the British Beagle 2 probe, which was due to land on a series of inflated balloons, but was never heard from after entering the atmosphere. It is the additional testing time required by changes to these technologies that has caused it to miss the October 2009 launch window. Due to the orbits of Mars and Earth, interplanetary travel between them is only feasible every two years for a window of a few weeks.\nThe delays and additional fabrication and testing have inflated the budget of the project by an additional 400 million US dollars, bringing the total to $2.4 billion. These increasing costs of Mars missions are what forced the decision by the ESA to delay its ExoMars mission, and they have now prompted talk of increased co-operation on future missions. The respective chief scientists at NASA and the ESA, Dr Ed Weiler and David Southwood, have already engaged in preliminary talks about such co-operation, and there is now talk of NASA joining the ESA on its ExoMars mission. Dr Weiler, speaking on such a possibility, said \"It is going to take some real scientists and engineers getting together and working that out. But is there a possibility it could become a joint mission? Absolutely. And we're certainly open to it and would welcome it.\"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"}

Northern Irish agriculture department officials have been in close contact with the Republic's Department of Agriculture, Fisheries, and Food (DAFF) as the situation has developed.

The team management, Nick Fry and Ross Brawn, have already announced confidence in their ability not only to find a buyer for the team but also to deliver the performance expected of Honda's 2009 car. Prices as low as \u00a31 have been put forward as possible prices tags for the Northampton based team, with Honda CEO Takeo Fukui stating that \"Just to make the team possible to exist, a small price tag is acceptable\".\nOn Saturday the Japanese car giant said that before selling the team it was going to offer British driver Jensen Button, who had given the Honda team its only victory, a way out of his recently signed multi-million pound contract with the team so he could try to get a drive with other teams. However, Ross Brawn appears eager to retain the Briton and either retain Brazilian Rubens Barrichello or sign GP2 driver Bruno Senna, nephew of legendary racer Ayrton Senna. At an industry awards dinner, Button indicated his desire for a buyer to be found for Honda, saying any buyer would get \"... a great team with excellent facilities. And with the leadership of Ross Brawn, and the whole team as they are, we can come through this and be on the grid in 2009\". Button has also spoken of his shock and pain at Honda's decision.\nRoss Brawn, who was brought into the Honda team with much fan fare before the 2008 season, has spoken of his shock at finding out about the sale of the team. Brawn, who is credited with helping Michael Schumacher and Ferrari dominate Formula One for much of the last decade, indicated he was expected funding cuts and had prepared a reduced budget but hadn't expected the full withdrawal of support that Honda announced. Brawn has also indicated understanding of Honda's reasoning, with their sales down 40% in some markets and Honda F1's \u00a3200m+ budget a cost they were unwilling to bear.\nThough Honda has committed to providing a budget for the team until March, the budget is lower than that which had been expected and so the team has had to pull out of the crucial winter tests at Jerez. This has denied Formula One hopeful Bruno Senna another test with the team and has combined with the engine implications of Honda's withdrawal to push the new car's final testing from January to March, just weeks before the first Grand Prix in Australia. Ross Brawn however remains confident of competing with new Formula One frontrunners BMW Sauber and Formula One supremo Bernie Ecclestone has tipped the team as a great buy, saying \"I've no doubt Honda would have been in top four next year without any problems. They've spent a lot of money to put themselves in that position so if anyone does want to be in F1 this is a team they should look to buy. It's a big opportunity for any company that's run efficiently to benefit\"."}

Liberal Leader Stephane Dion and NDP Leader Jack Layton addressed the crowd, pointing out that the 62% majority of the voters voted against Conservative Prime Minister Stephen Harper's right-wing politics. Harper campaigned on the premise of bringing in policies to stimulate the economy during the current economic downturn.\nHarper shut down Parliament last week until January 26th to prevent opposition parties from defeating his government with a vote of non-confidence. The centrist Liberals and social democratic New Democratic Party formed an unprecedented coalition with the support of the Quebec based Bloc Quebecois to stop Harper from banning strikes in the public sector, preventing pay equity settlements, and removing public funding to all political parties.\nLatest figures show seventy-seven thousand more workers lost their jobs in November. Signs in the crowd were visibly in both French and English.\nThe event was Hosted by TV star Mary Walsh, who, in a nod to recent U.S. elections, led a resounding chant of \"Yes We Can-ada!\" The main message of the day was that people want a government representing the majority of Canadian voters to tackle the economic crisis. Performers on stage included Samba Squad and members of Broken Social Scene. The day ended with the singing of \"O Canada\"."}

Rossignol and Sax were flying in a 1979 twin-engine Piper PA-44 Seminole, from Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport, which was headed to a practice area near Opa-locka Airport, when they collided with Brown and Jefferson, who were flying a 1997 single-engine Cessna 172R that had departed from North Perry Airport.\nKathleen Bergen, a spokeswoman for the Federal Aviation Administration, has stated that neither pilot filed a flight plan, which was not required, because the planes were flying under visual flight rules, meaning that pilots were responsible to watch for other planes.\nThe owners of the two planes reported them missing early Sunday after they failed to return. Florida state officials were made aware of the accident, and the search began. A Coast Guard Dolphin search-and-rescue helicopter discovered three separate debris fields at 8:00 AM, according to Coleman-Wright. Following this discovery, the Sheriff's Office deployed air boats into the area due to accessibility issues.\nThe bodies were recovered and identified by Monday morning, much to the relief of some relatives. Rohan Brown, cousin of Stuart Brown commented that \"the whole family is thankful for that.\"\nBoth Brown and Jefferson were originally from Jamaica, and Brown aspired to fly for his country's airline.\nSax, taking advanced flight training, was the passenger in the Piper.\nPiloting the Piper was Rossignol, who grew up in Biddeford, Maine, and was following in the family profession as his father, Richard Rossignol, is a commercial airline pilot for Continental Airlines.\nHis brother Matt Rossignol said that \"he loved flying because my father's a pilot.

He alleged that Obama had dual nationality at birth, because of his Kansas-born mother and his Kenyan-born father, who was a British subject at the time. Obama's birth certificate states he was born in Hawaii in August 1961, two years after the Hawaii Admission Act.\nIn November 2008, Donofrio's injunction application was filed with the Supreme Court of New Jersey. The applications then went to the Supreme Court but it was denied by Justice David H. Souter. The petition was refiled and assigned to Justice Clarence Thomas, who submitted the case to the Court for Conference on December 5.\nThe United States Constitution's 14th amendment clearly defines the law on American citizenship: \"All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.\" Statutes passed since the constitution are more detailed about who is a citizen at birth.

The arrest comes after a three-year investigation into Blagojevich's \"pay-to-play politics.\"\nSpecifically, the Department of Justice alleged that Blagojevich attempted to sell the Senate seat previously held by President-elect Barack Obama. Blagojevich, as governor, has the sole authority to appoint someone to complete Obama's term. Authorities believe the process to select a new senator was tainted after authorities secretly recorded several of Blagojevich's conversations. They believe that he was attempting to sell the seat in exchange for financial benefit for himself and his wife.\nDocuments from the FBI and from U.S. attorney Patrick Fitzgerald identify the people whom Blagojevich was considering as Senate Candidates 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. According to Fitzgerald's press release, Blagojevich told an advisor that he wanted to \"get some (money) up front, maybe.\"\nIn Illinois, a new state ethics law will take effect on January 1, 2009, so Blagojevich was trying to embezzle as much money as he could before that date, said Fitzgerald.\nAuthorities also believe that Blagojevich was trying to withhold state financial assistance from the owner of the \"Tribune\", the Tribune Company, which recently filed for bankruptcy protection. They allege he was trying to get members of the editorial board of the \"Chicago Tribune\" fired by threatening to complicate the sale of Wrigley Field by Tribune Company.\nOn December 8, Blagojevich responded to the reports that federal authorities had wiretapped his phone conversations, saying that \"I should say if anybody wants to tape my conversations, go right ahead, feel free to do it. I can tell you that whatever I say is always lawful and the things I'm interested in are always lawful.\"\nIf convicted, Blagojevich could face up to 30 years in prison and $500,000 in fines.\nThis is not the first time in Illinois history that a governor has been arrested for corruption charges.

The FIA is meeting with teams in Monte Carlo and is expected to approve the use by some teams of a standardised power unit provided by Cosworth, an automotive engineering company, from 2010 onwards. The move to a standard engine, which is common in lower tiers of open wheeled racing such as GP2, was pushed for by FIA President Max Mosley earlier this year as he aims to reduce team costs. This would not see the exclusion of manufacturer made engines, as at this time participation in the system would be voluntary and teams would be free to build licensed Cosworth engines or their own powerplants but on a performance par with the Cosworth unit. Mosley has stated that stabilising Formula One means that the FIA \"...must stabilize the system with a base engine which anyone can have and which is inexpensive, as well as a standard gearbox\" and has warned of future budget problems, saying that \"Honda pulled out because of falling car sales and there is no guarantee that these falling sales, which affect all manufacturers, will not drop further\".\nAhead of the meeting of the FIA there have been rumours in the Italian press that Formula One team Renault had broken with the Formula One Teams' Association (FOTA), rumours which Renault has strongly denied. FOTA was established earlier this year by the teams to negotiate with the FIA over cost cutting measures and other changes, changes it hopes will stop the introduction of compulsory standardisation of engines and other parts on F1 cars. The FOTA's position was hard hit last week by the announcement by Honda that they were leaving F1 due to the economic crisis, a move which has caused many teams to re-assert their commitment to a future in Formula One. David Richards, whose Prodrive entry to Formula One was called off last season due to costs, highlighted what he sees as the need for fundamental changes, saying that Honda's exit was 'a salutary lesson for the whole of F1 that things are going to have to change, and everything is going to have to come back a little bit if the whole sport is to prosper in the future'.\nFive teams have reportedly expressed an interest in the Cosworth engines from the 2010 season, the five being all four independent teams (Williams, Force India, Red Bull Racing and Scuderia Toro Rosso) joined by manufacturer Renault. If only four teams sign up to the idea, the FIA has announced it will go ahead. Renault have been highly vocal in criticising the failure of the engine development freeze that has existed in Formula One and have, after a couple of seasons of struggling, been under pressure from their parent company to justify the continued expenditure in Formula One. Cosworth have previously been prolific engine suppliers in Formula One, their last stint was supplying engines to Williams in 2006.\nThe talks come as many of the Formula One teams are in Jerez for part of their winter testing regime, with potential Toro Rosso driver Sebastian Buemi topping the time sheets for the first two days."}

The action appears to be in direct response to the \"Wikipedia\" article and image blockage by the IWF on December 7. According to their website, the BPjM's goal is to \"protect children and adolescents in Germany from any media which might contain harmful or dangerous content\", pursuant to Germany's Youth Protection Act. The protection act regulates the distribution of harmful materials to minors. According to German press reports, the FSM received complaints and concerns that the image could be considered child pornography and pose a danger to minors.\nThe \"Virgin Killer\" album cover is from the 1976 German rock band Scorpions. It depicts a girl who appears to be around 10 to 12-years old, posing nude, with a lens crack crossing over her genitals, but nothing blocking out her breasts. It first appeared on the band's album over thirty years ago, and Klaus Meine, the lead singer for Scorpions, recently said that they regret having made the cover. It was later replaced with a photo of the band.\nDespite the complaint, the FSM does not believe the album cover is actually child pornography, but says the dissemination of images of underage children as appears on the album cover, is \"forbidden\" in Germany.\n\"The picture shows the girl in an unnatural 'pose', and a such depiction is prohibited according to the German Youth Media Protection Law,\" said Maja Winter to \"Wikinews\" in an exclusive statement.\nThe URLs to the album cover will be blocked from being displayed or searched in search results in the German search engine service, which according to Winter \"are members of the FSM\". Winter also added that internet users in Germany will not be blocked from accessing the image.\n\"The URL will thus still be online, but will not be searchable by the respective search engine services. The FSM is not planning nor developing nor implementing an internet filter on the access-level to block [the cover],\" added Winter who also said that she had no information on previous complaints in the past 30 years. Winter also could not answer why the FSM decided to take such an action after so many years of the album cover being available and should contact the BPjM for more information. Despite the claim from the FSM, the BPjM said in a statement to \"Wikinews\" that they denied having any knowledge of any such attempt at removing URLs to the cover.\n\"The BPjM has no knowledge of any measures being taken to block the depiction of the album cover from German search engines,\" said Petra Meier, a spokesperson for the BPjM to \"Wikinews\". The spokesperson also added that there have been no complaints filed with the BPjM regarding the cover.\nAs first reported by \"Wikinews\" on December 7, British Internet Service Providers (ISPs) implemented a monitoring and filtering mechanism that blocked access to the album cover and the album's article on \"Wikipedia\". The measures applied redirect traffic for a significant portion of the UK's Internet population through six servers which can log and filter the content that is available to the end user. A serious side-effect of this is the inability of administrators on Wikimedia sites to block vandals and other troublemakers without potentially impacting hundreds of thousands of innocent contributors who are working on the sites in good faith. The IWF said that the image could \"contain illegal\" material, but on December 9, reversed their decision and unblocked the image and article.\n\"The Protection of Children Act 1978 as amended in the Sexual Offences Act 2003, makes it an offence to take, make, permit to be taken, distribute, show, possess with intent to distribute, and advertise indecent photographs or pseudo-photographs of children under the age of 18. The \u2018making\u2019 of such images includes downloading, that is, making a copy of a child sexual abuse image on a computer, so, in the UK, accessing such content online is a serious criminal offence,\" said the IWF in a statement on their website on December 7. Despite this, Mike Godwin, the legal counsel for Wikimedia said on December 9 that the image does not appear to be illegal anywhere in the world.\n\"We recognize the good intentions of Internet watch groups, including their focus on blocking and discouraging illegal content. Nevertheless, this incident underscores the need for transparency and accountability in the processes of the Internet Watch Foundation and similar bodies around the world,\" said the legal counsel for Wikimedia, Mike Godwin. On December 8, Godwin stated that there is \"no reason to believe the article, or the image contained in the article, has been held to be illegal in any jurisdiction anywhere in the world.\""}

However, neither candidate reached the 50% mark needed to declare an outright winner.\nSix other candidates were also present on the ballot, stealing enough votes to prevent either candidate from winning half of the vote. The third-party candidate receiving the most votes was businessman Paa Kwesi Nduom representing the Convention People's Party (CPP), who took 1.3% of the vote.\nOut of some 8.6 million votes cast, more than 200,000, or 2.4% of the full total, were rejected, which also may have helped prevent either candidate from reaching 50%. Overall voter turnout in the election was 69.52%.\nThe presidential candidates are vying to replace the incumbent president John Kufuor, who will be stepping down in January of next year after serving a maximum of two terms.\nThe electoral commission did not announce results of the simultaneous parliamentary elections, but preliminary results suggest that the NDC obtained no less than 115 seats, out of a total of 230 in the parliament. It is probable that the NPP will lose the large parliamentary majority it had enjoyed.\nThe run-off election is scheduled for the 28th of December."}

Another engine freeze will occur at the start of the 2010 season, with the engines from 2010 continuing through to the end of 2012. The FIA also intends to try to introduce standardised transmission systems in 2010 and will look at chassis design to determine which aerodynamic parts will be standardised or allowed to be competitive differentiators. Races will see more changes in 2010 with the use of tyre warmers and refuelling banned, and the possibility of shorter race distances has been put forward pending market research. What work the teams can engage in at the factories will also be further limited this season to reduce the manpower and other running costs.\nThe FIA has raised the possibility of a new power train entirely to be developed for the 2013 season, in consultation with the Formula One Teams Association, and will also discuss making Kinetic Energy Recovery Systems (KERS) compulsory from 2010. KERS, which is being introduced as a voluntary measure in 2009, has divided the teams with some embracing the technology while others, such as Ferrari, have criticised it."}

Speaking to media at the Taipei District Court, he said: \"I want to thank my lawyers, members of the Democratic Progressive Party and my supporters who have given me huge encouragement. I am grateful to those who cared for, supported and looked after me so I could get through the hardest and loneliest 32 days of my life in prison.\" He earns the historical distinction of being the first ex-president of the Republic of China to be indicted for criminal offenses and could suffer life imprisonment if convicted.\nAlong with 13 other family members and close associates, including his wheelchair-bound wife, son Chen Chih-Chung, and daughter-in-law Huang Jui-ching, Chen was indicted Friday on charges of embezzling government funds and laundering money or ill-gotten bribes. The panel of three judges ruled he should appear at future court hearings and must not leave the country nor change his address.\nProsecutor Lin Che-hui accused Chen of having \"embezzled 104 million New Taiwan dollars ($3.12 million) from a special presidential fund, and received bribes of $11.73 million in connection with a government land procurement deal and a separate construction project; the damning piece of evidence was the presence of NT$740 million ($22.2 million) in cash stashed in a Taipei bank safety vault held by the Chens.\" Yuanta Securities director Tu Li-ping said, \"she hand delivered NT$200 million ($6 million) in cash to Wu at the presidential residence in 2006 on behalf of executives of an affiliated bank; the money was an incentive for Wu not to interfere with a merger the bank was pursuing.\"\nChen insists on his innocence. Contradicting the 100-page indictment, he said that \"the $21 million his wife wired to their son's Swiss bank accounts came from leftover campaign donations. Taiwanese law permits such donations to be kept by political candidates.\"\nIn 1975, Chen married Wu Shu-chen (\u5433\u6dd1\u73cd), the daughter of a physician. The couple has a daughter, Chen Hsing-yu (), who is a dentist; and a son, Chen Chih-Chung (), who, having received a law degree in Taiwan, studied at and graduated with a M.A. degree from the University of California in 2005.\nIn November 2006, Chen's wife Wu Shu-chen and three other high ranking officials of the Presidential Office were indicted for corruption, charged with misappropriating NT$14.8 million (USD$450,000) of government funds using falsified documents. Due to the protection from the Constitution against prosecution of the sitting president, Chen could not be prosecuted until he left office, and he was not indicted, but was alleged to be an accomplice on his wife's indictment. \nChen's term as President of the Republic of China ended in May 2008. Immediately thereafter, prosecutors began investigating him regarding allegations that he misused his discretionary \"state affairs fund\", as well as his connection to the first family's money-laundering activities. He resigned from the Democratic Progressive Party on August 15, 2008, one day after admitting to falsifying past campaign expenses and wiring campaign contributions to overseas accounts.\nIn November 2008, Chen was escorted by a security staff, into the Taipei prosecutor's office for questioning. After 6 hours, he left the Supreme Court prosecutor`s office in handcuffs, was arrested and detained. The charges each carry a minimum penalty of 5 years imprisonment. Following a 6 day hunger strike while in detention, Chen collapsed and was rushed to Taipei's Far Eastern Memorial Hospital, where he was later transferred to Panchiao Hospital for force-feeding. Despite Chen's lack of interest in appealing, his lawyer Cheng Wen-long completed a motion seeking his release from detention and filed a notice of appeal of the court's decision, along with a petition for constitutional interpretation to restrain actions violative of the Constitution.\nProsecutor General, Chen Tsung-ming said that after Chen\u2019s case had been removed to the Taipei Local Court, he would re-file a petition for Chen's detention. Chen and the main opposition DPP have accused President Ma Ying-jeou's administration of \"using the scandals to plan a political plot against the former leader.\"\nMeanwhile, The Straits Times reported that \"prosecutors are to investigate former President of the Republic of China and Chairman of the Kuomintang from 1988 to 2000, Lee Teng-hui on suspicion of money laundering, based on allegations made by Chen during his own questioning recently that his predecessor transferred large funds abroad through dummy accounts.\" Mr. Lee angrily denied the accusations concerning \"a suspected transfer of 50 million Taiwan dollars (US$2.26 million) to Mr Lee from a local stock investor via overseas dummy accounts.\" Charges also included transactions made at the end of Lee's tenure and at the beginning of Chen's term, including \"one billion Taiwan dollars that had been wired to various countries including Singapore.\"\nThe China Post calls for calm and urges fair trial for Chen. \"All the people should wait patiently for the outcome of the trial ... They shouldn't do anything to influence the judges in any way, because the rule of law in Taiwan is at stake. We should show the world that Taiwan is a democracy where anybody who commits a crime, be he a man on the street or a former president, is duly punished.\" it said."}

The lawsuit claims that tobacco makers who manufacture \"light\" and \"low tar\" cigarettes had deceived smokers into thinking the products are safer than regular cigarettes. Former United States Solicitor General Theodore Olson, now working with Gibson, Dunn &amp; Crutcher, argued the case for the petitioners, Altria Group and Philip Morris USA.\nSeveral smokers in recent decades switched to light cigarettes, with fervent faith they posed less of a danger to their health. But scientific or medical researches have shown this common-sense view is wrong. Although mechanical tests showed \"light\" cigarettes emitted less tar when burned, actual smokers inhale about the same amount of tar when they puff on a light cigarette, the studies found. The cigarette business faces more than 30 class-action lawsuits from smokers and ex-smokers who seek billions of dollars in damages and claim they were deceived by the marketing of light and low-tar cigarettes.\nRespondents Stephanie Good and 2 others are Maine residents and for over 15 years smoked Marlboro Lights and Cambridge Lights cigarettes, which are manufactured by petitioners Altria Group and Philip Morris USA. They sought damages compensation for economic rather than medical harm, claiming they had overpaid for cigarettes based on fraudulent advertisements suggesting that light cigarettes were safer than regular ones. The Labeling Act requires tobacco companies to indicate rotating warnings on their packaging and advertising. \u201cNo requirement or prohibition 'based on smoking and health' shall be imposed under state law with respect to the advertising or promotion,\u201d the law provides, and only if the labeling requirements on cigarettes are obeyed. \nIn the case, the Court applied the pertinent Federal laws, in question, Title 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1334(b), the \"Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act\" and Me. Rev. Stat. Ann., Tit. 5, \u00a7 207 (Supp. 2008), the \"Maine Unfair Trade Practices Act\" (MUTPA). It held that \"the Labeling Act neither expressly nor impliedly pre-empts respondents\u2019 fraud claim.\" The landmark decision allows the lawsuit to proceed on the merits upon remand to the trial court below. The ruling strikes a blow against a broad effort by U.S. corporations to limit their exposure to lawsuits filed under federal law. \nThe court also dismissed Philip Morris's argument that the Federal Trade Commission's mid-1960s endorsement of machine testing of cigarette tar and nicotine levels \"should relieve the company of liability for alleged fraud.\" In November, the FTC officially dropped its endorsement of the Cambridge Filter Method, saying it is flawed because \"the machine doesn't take into account the way smokers adjust their behavior.\"\nThe Supreme Court in a June ruling, said 8 to 1 that \"a case filed in a state court alleging a defective catheter was pre-empted by a federal statue providing regulation of medical devices to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.\" The court also ruled in 1992 in 'Cipollone v. Liggett Group, Inc.' that \"the phrase 'based on smoking and health' in the Labeling Act did not apply to pre-empt suits under state laws based on the 'general duty' not to make fraudulent statements.\" \nJustice Clarence Thomas said that \"some kinds of fraud claims against cigarette makers may go forward, just not those concerning smoking and health. Thus, if cigarette manufacturers were to falsely advertise their products as \u2018American-made\u2019 or \u2018the official cigarette of Major League Baseball,\u2019 state-law claims arising from that wrongful behavior would not be pre-empted. Forbidding lawsuits based on health claims, would not mean consumers lack protection, as tobacco marketing is subject to regulatory oversight.\" \nAltria's associate general counsel, Murray Garnick, in a statement, said \"we continue to view these cases as manageable, and the company will assert many of the strong defenses used successfully in the past to defend against this very type of case.\""}

Bush during a press conference on Sunday in Baghdad.\nDargham al-Zaidi, the brother of Muntadar, the 28-year-old journalist who gave Bush 'the boot', says that he received severe injuries after he was allegedly beaten by authorities and security officials who tried to detain Muntadar. Dargham says his brother is suffering from internal bleeding, broken ribs, an injury to one of his eyes and is receiving treatment at a U.S. military hospital in Baghdad.\nDargham also says that his brother has not been able to see a lawyer since being arrested, even though several have stepped forward in an offer to defend him.\nBefore throwing his shoes at Bush, the reporter, Muntader al-Zaidi of Al-Baghdadia, an Iraqi-owned television station based in Cairo, Egypt, stood up and said, \"This is a farewell kiss from the Iraqi people, dog!\" The words were followed by the reporter's two shoes being thrown at Bush in succession, who had to duck in order to avoid being hit by them. Shortly after each shoe flew within a few inches of Bush, authorities quickly neutralized the reporter and took him out of the room. Before his exit, the man further screamed \"this is the end!\" Dargham says his brother threw his shoes at Bush because he hates the \"material American occupation\" of Iraq, and the influence Iran has in Iraq.\nIn Arabic culture, hitting or throwing shoes at someone so the soles hit them is considered to be the greatest insult. In 2003, when Iraqi citizens tore down the statue of Saddam Hussein in downtown Baghdad, they began to smack it with the soles of their shoes.\nAs a result of the allegations, protests are now planned around Iraq.

Two weeks ago Dr. Siemionow, in a 23-hour marathon surgery, replaced 80 percent of her face, by transplanting or grafting bone, nerve, blood vessels, muscles and skin harvested from a female donor's cadaver. \nThe Clinic surgeons, in Wednesday's news conference, described the details of the transplant but upon request, the team did not publish her name, age and cause of injury nor the donor\u2019s identity. \nThe patient's family desired the reason for her transplant to remain confidential. The Los Angeles Times reported that the patient \"had no upper jaw, nose, cheeks or lower eyelids and was unable to eat, talk, smile, smell or breathe on her own.\" The clinic's dermatology and plastic surgery chair, Francis Papay, described the nine hours phase of the procedure: \"We transferred the skin, all the facial muscles in the upper face and mid-face, the upper lip, all of the nose, most of the sinuses around the nose, the upper jaw including the teeth, the facial nerve.\" Thereafter, another team spent three hours sewing the woman's blood vessels to that of the donor's face to restore blood circulation, making the graft a success.\nThe New York Times reported that \"three partial face transplants have been performed since 2005, two in France and one in China, all using facial tissue from a dead donor with permission from their families.\" \"Only the forehead, upper eyelids, lower lip, lower teeth and jaw are hers, the rest of her face comes from a cadaver; she could not eat on her own or breathe without a hole in her windpipe. About 77 square inches of tissue were transplanted from the donor,\" it further described the details of the medical marvel. The patient, however, must take lifetime immunosuppressive drugs, also called antirejection drugs, which do not guarantee success. The transplant team said that in case of failure, it would replace the part with a skin graft taken from her own body.\nDr. Bohdan Pomahac, a Brigham and Women's Hospital surgeon praised the recent medical development. \"There are patients who can benefit tremendously from this. It's great that it happened,\" he said.\nLeading bioethicist Arthur Caplan of the University of Pennsylvania withheld judgment on the Cleveland transplant amid grave concerns on the post-operation results. \"The biggest ethical problem is dealing with failure \u2014 if your face rejects. It would be a living hell. If your face is falling off and you can't eat and you can't breathe and you're suffering in a terrible manner that can't be reversed, you need to put on the table assistance in dying. There are patients who can benefit tremendously from this. It's great that it happened,\" he said.\nDr Alex Clarke, of the Royal Free Hospital had praised the Clinic for its contribution to medicine. \u201cIt is a real step forward for people who have severe disfigurement and this operation has been done by a team who have really prepared and worked towards this for a number of years. These transplants have proven that the technical difficulties can be overcome and psychologically the patients are doing well. They have all have reacted positively and have begun to do things they were not able to before. All the things people thought were barriers to this kind of operations have been overcome,\u201d she said.\nThe first partial face transplant surgery on a living human was performed on Isabelle Dinoire on November 27 2005, when she was 38, by Professor Bernard Devauchelle, assisted by Professor Jean-Michel Dubernard in Amiens, France. Her Labrador dog mauled her in May 2005. A triangle of face tissue including the nose and mouth was taken from a brain-dead female donor and grafted onto the patient. Scientists elsewhere have performed scalp and ear transplants. However, the claim is the first for a mouth and nose transplant. Experts say the mouth and nose are the most difficult parts of the face to transplant.\nIn 2004, the same Cleveland Clinic, became the first institution to approve this surgery and test it on cadavers. In October 2006, surgeon Peter Butler at London's Royal Free Hospital in the UK was given permission by the NHS ethics board to carry out a full face transplant. His team will select four adult patients (children cannot be selected due to concerns over consent), with operations being carried out at six month intervals. In March 2008, the treatment of 30-year-old neurofibromatosis victim Pascal Coler of France ended after having received what his doctors call the worlds first successful full face transplant.\nEthical concerns, psychological impact, problems relating to immunosuppression and consequences of technical failure have prevented teams from performing face transplant operations in the past, even though it has been technically possible to carry out such procedures for years.\nMr Iain Hutchison, of Barts and the London Hospital, warned of several problems with face transplants, such as blood vessels in the donated tissue clotting and immunosuppressants failing or increasing the patient's risk of cancer. He also pointed out ethical issues with the fact that the procedure requires a \"beating heart donor\". The transplant is carried out while the donor is brain dead, but still alive by use of a ventilator.\nAccording to Stephen Wigmore, chair of British Transplantation Society's ethics committee, it is unknown to what extent facial expressions will function in the long term. He said that it is not certain whether a patient could be left worse off in the case of a face transplant failing.\nMr Michael Earley, a member of the Royal College of Surgeon's facial transplantation working party, commented that if successful, the transplant would be \"a major breakthrough in facial reconstruction\" and \"a major step forward for the facially disfigured.\"\nIn Wednesday's conference, Siemionow said \"we know that there are so many patients there in their homes where they are hiding from society because they are afraid to walk to the grocery stores, they are afraid to go the the street.\" \"Our patient was called names and was humiliated. We very much hope that for this very special group of patients there is a hope that someday they will be able to go comfortably from their houses and enjoy the things we take for granted,\" she added.\nIn response to the medical breakthrough, a British medical group led by Royal Free Hospital's lead surgeon Dr Peter Butler, said they will finish the world's first full face transplant within a year. \"We hope to make an announcement about a full-face operation in the next 12 months. This latest operation shows how facial transplantation can help a particular group of the most severely facially injured people. These are people who would otherwise live a terrible twilight life, shut away from public gaze,\" he said."}

And, at 14:56, blowing a long horn, the 0-Series train left for the final trip. \nJapanese news media report that approximately 2,800 people gathered to see off the final departure, so did many in the stations the train stopped by. Lastly, the train arrived at Hakata as scheduled at 18:01, welcomed by about 1,600 fans. \nShinkansen network was launched on 1 October 1964, just before Tokyo Olympic Games, with a route connecting the capital Tokyo and Osaka City (now operated by JR-Central). The route for 0-Series trains was gradually extended to the west, which in 1975 reached Hakata area of Fukuoka City (now by JR-West). \nShinkansen 0 Series has a characteristic round face with a part like a shallow bowl, and was nicknamed \"dango-bana\" or \"dangoppana\" (literally, \"dumpling nose\"). At the time of its debut, 0 Series ran at a maximum speed of 210 km/h, which was the world's highest. HIKARI, meaning beam or light, was the name of trains for the faster service. Even while more modern and faster series were rising, 0 Series continued to serve for some years, but in 1999 it ceased from JR-Central services, and in March 2000 from regular HIKARI runs of JR-West.\nAccording to the media, remaining 0-Series Shinkansen cars are destined to be scrapped. Some other cars, which were withdrawn earlier, are preserved in museums including one in Osaka and National Railway Museum in the U.K. "}

A small core group of scientists updates the entries in Wikipedia, but a long tail of scientists and other Wikipedians have contributed as well. Due to the scientific nature of the entries, vandalism has not been a large problem, according to Sean Eddy, a computational biologist at the Janelia Farm Research Campus of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute in Ashburn, Virginia.\n\"The novelty is that for the first time it creates a link between Wikipedia and traditional journal publishing, with its peer-review element,\" Alex Bateman from the Rfam database told \"Nature News\". This way, scientists are encouraged to submit to Wikipedia, while they are rewarded with a citable publication in a peer review journal (which in turn drives their funding). In the interview with \"Nature\", the journal's editor expressed her hopes that other journals would adopt the model.\nThe new Wikipedia entry will be peer reviewed separately before it is published on Wikipedia. The first article in the new journal section will deal with SmY RNA, a family which now has its own Wikipedia article. According to the online version of the article, it was submitted on November 21, 2008, and accepted five days later. The Wikipedia article was moved from the userpage of one of the co-authors to the article section one day before submission.\nIn an accompanying editorial, the new Associate Editor-in-Chief of the new section, Paul P. Gardner, explained: \"...A Wikipedia entry is usually among the top few hits from a Google search with a molecular biology keyword. Therefore, we would like to ensure that the RNA relevant information in Wikipedia is both reliable and current. We think that this track will provide an important mechanism by which time will be spent by experts to improve the record.\"\nThe author guidelines for this new section contain a mini-guide for the scientists to publishing their first Wikipedia article, mostly from a technical aspect (explaining syntax) rather than as a style guide.\nIn the field of molecular biology, wiki technology is increasingly being used. For example, two biochemists and Wikipedians, Professor William J. Wedemeyer and Tim Vickers, MSc, PhD, hosted a Wikipedia workshop last Tuesday at the American Society for Cell Biology Annual Meeting. \nThe Wiki approach is not met with undivided enthusiasm; last March, 250 scientists wrote a petition in the magazine \"Science\" to ask GenBank to allow community annotation of its DNA sequences, but their request to 'Wikify' GenBank was denied.\nIn an e-mail to \"Wikinews\" and on the \"Nature\" website, Prof. Wedemeyer called the new initiative a \"promising method for outreach, connecting the scientific world with the public that usually pays for the research,\" by \"centralizing public outreach in the widely read Wikipedia.\" He said that the initiative \"seems likely to be effective.\""}

In a decision reached in Oran, Algeria, energy ministers from all 12 OPEC members agreed to make the largest cut in OPEC's history. \nOil prices have fallen from a high of $140 in July to just around $40; a decrease of $100. OPEC has cut 4.2 million bpd since September, when the price of oil decreased suddenly over fears of a global recession and lower usage of oil. With this new decrease, production by OPEC members will be 24.845 million bpd. Saudi Arabia is taking the majority of the cut by decreasing their production by 1.2 million bpd.\nIn the statement released by the organization, they wrote \"...that crude volumes entering the market remain well in excess of actual demand: this is clearly demonstrated by the fact that crude stocks in OECD countries are well above their five-year average and are expected to continue to rise. Moreover, the impact of the grave global economic downturn has led to a destruction of demand, resulting in unprecedented downward pressure being exerted on prices...\"\nOPEC faces a tough task in trying to level the price of oil to a reasonable amount. Most experts and oil officials believe that $75 is the 'fair price' for a barrel of oil. Chakib Khelil, the OPEC president, said during the meeting that \"OPEC has a long-established record in meeting the challenges it faces, however tough they may be. The challenge facing the oil market today is clearly a formidable one.\"\nRussia, which is not a member of OPEC, also agreed that a cut was needed and would cut its production by 600,000 barrels. OPEC will also urge other non-OPEC members who are oil exports, to cut their production. Mexico and Norway are two of the largest oil producers that not members of OPEC. Russia's action is not official, and the country has had a history of failing their pledge to cut their output."}

The event has similarities to the crash of British Airways Flight 38 in January at London's Heathrow Airport.\nThe AAIB and the NTSB are now collaborating to try and determine whether or not the two events are in fact linked. On November 26 a Delta 777-200ER cruising at 39,000 feet near Great Falls suffered a serious reduction in power on the right-hand (number 2) engine without input from either the flight crew or the aircraft's control systems. The pilots lowered the jetliner to 31,000 feet in accordance with procedures in the flight manuals and regained full power in the engine.\nFrom that point on, the engine behaved normally again. The flight, Flight 18 from Shanghai, continued to its destination of Atlanta.\nInvestigators have noticed similarities to the January crash of a British Airways jet in London. Flight 38, another 777, suffered this same uncommanded loss of engine thrust in both engines during final approach to Heathrow on January 17, and crashed short of the runway. There were no fatalities, although several passengers were injured. The aircraft was written off.\nAn interim report by the AAIB, which is leading the investigation into the crash of Flight 38, has suggested that an ice buildup during the trip from China in the fuel supply caused the accident. As a result, Boeing recommended pilots of such aircraft occasionally rev up their engines on lengthy flights to stop ice from building up.\nBoth airliners were equipped with twin Rolls-Royce Trent 895 engines. The NTSB appointed Senior Air Safety Investigator Bill English as the accredited representative of the US to the AAIB on the London crash. Now, he has also been put in charge of the NTSB investigation into the Delta midair incident. The two investigative bodies are now working with each other to try to identify whether there are common circumstances behind both events.\nAmong the parties to the investigation are Eaton-Argotech. The firm manufactures fuel systems for commercial airliners, amongst other users. Also participating are the US Federal Aviation Administration, Boeing, Delta, and the Air Line Pilots Association."}

The pact had begun to fail weeks ago with tit-for-tat attacks across Israel's border with the Gaza Strip. The past six months have seen a dramatic drop in the number of rockets and mortars fired into Israel from Gaza. Yesterday saw an escalation of the violence, beginning with an Israeli air raid on Gaza and Hamas responded to Israel's attack by firing eight rockets and five mortars at Israel's southern towns. However the past three days have seen up to 50 rockets fired, and Israeli operations in Gaza. The European Union called for an \"immediate cessation\" of both Palestinian rocket fire and Israeli incursions. \n\"The calm is over\", said Hamas official Ayman Taha, after talks with other Palestinian factions. \"The calm, which was reached with Egyptian sponsorship on June 19 and expires on December 19, is finished because the enemy did not abide by its obligations,\" said Fawzi Barhum, a spokesman for the Hamas. \"The truce will end tomorrow.\" Hamas has also released a training video, and warned Israel that any attacks on Gaza would \"open the doors of the battle wide\". \n\"We think the lull is in the best interest of both sides,\" stated Israel Foreign Ministry spokesman Yigal Palmor. \"We would like it to continue. If Hamas chooses violence over the cease-fire, rocket shooting over the possibility of improving the situation in Gaza, then one must ask oneself whether Hamas has the best interests of its people in mind or whether there are foreign interests that are involved.\"\nHamas have said that Israel had failed to ease its blockade of Gaza but Israeli officials insist that there was no commitment to ease the siege. The UN's relief agency described the situation as a \"profound human dignity crisis\". A BBC correspondent said that \"the best pragmatists on both sides can hope for is that the end of truce will not necessarily lead to a major outbreak of fighting.\"\nIn the week leading up to the end of the truce, tens of thousands of Hamas supporters rallied in a Gaza City stadium to celebrate the 21st anniversary of the group's founding during the First Intifada. Mahmoud Zahar, a senior Hamas official, commented that \"Hamas has gone from stone-throwing to guns and rockets, from a support base of a few thousand people to a backing of millions in Arab countries and around the world.\" During the rally a Hamas activist dressed as Gilad Shalit and begged for his life, asking to come home. \"I miss my mother and father,\" he said in Hebrew. The Israeli UN envoy, Professor Gabriela Shalev, decried the Hamas play mocking Gilad Shalit and voiced Israel's outrage.\nOn Tuesday, 16 December, an Israeli court sentenced Aziz Dweik, the democratically elected head of the Palestinian Legislative Council, the Palestinian parliament, to three years in prison for belonging to Hamas. He was arrested with other politicians after the capture of Gilad Shalit. On Sunday, 14 December, Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter met with Khaled Meshaal, the leader of Hamas' political wing. The five-hour meeting was to discuss negotiations for the release of Gilad Shalit, a corporal in the Israeli Defense Forces. Khaled said Hamas would allow Shalit to send a message to his parents but would not release him. The Interim Arab Parliament (IAP) has called on the international community to work for the release of Palestinian Legislative Council (PLC) Speaker Aziz Dweik.\nPalestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas, who is to hold talks with President George W. Bush on Friday, will press Washington to ensure \"there is no return to square one once there is a new government in Israel,\" said Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erakat. The AP reports that President Bush and Abbas are assessing the stalled U.S.-backed negotiations with Israel that will almost certainly fail to meet a year-end deadline for a peace deal. The U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice has said she believes the Annapolis process is the best way to a peace deal between Israel and the Palestinians. U.N. Security Council endorsed the process as irreversible and urged the two parties to continue talking under its guidelines."}

Justices Consuelo Ynares-Santiago, Alicia Austria-Martinez, Conchita Carpio-Morales and Renato Corona did not attend the traditional court proceeding. Newsbreak Magazine has reported that \"Justice Ruben T. Reyes, who came to the SC under a cloud of doubt, is leaving the hallowed chamber under a cloud of doubt. The leakage scandal that has embarrassed members of the Court has further underscored the respect--or lack of it--his peers have bestowed on Reyes.\"\nIn a December 12 three-page en banc resolution, penned by Justice Ruben Reyes, the Court formed an Investigating Committee under Justice Justice Leonardo Quisumbing, \u201cto investigate the unauthorized release of the unpromulgated ponencia ... to determine who are responsible for this leakage of a confidential internal document of the En Banc, and to recommend to the En Banc the appropriate actions thereon.\u201d \nA preliminary contempt of court citation order was also issued against the petitioner Louis Biraogo. The unpublished decision, \u201cis part of the confidential internal deliberations of the Court. No copy of the unpromulgated ponencia can be released to any person outside of the En Banc. Any release of a copy to the public, or to the parties, of an unpromulgated ponencia infringes on the confidential internal deliberations of the Court and constitutes contempt of court,\u201d the Court ruled.\nIn the 2007 Philippine congressional election for Negros Oriental\u2019s first district, Limkaichong won over poll candidates Jerome Paras and Oliver Paras. Biraogo had filed a disqualification case against Limkaichong for allegedly being a Chinese. He distributed to local media copies of the 37-page July 15 Court decision duly signed by all of the justices except Chief Justice Reynato Puno. The unpromulgated judgment annulled Limkaichong's election victory.\nIn a two-page letter, Biraogo has revealed an \u201cirregularity\u201d in the High Tribunal. He told media, that \"a law dean, who is a close fraternity brother of Chief Justice Puno and a junior assistant of the Solicitor-General, who is also Puno\u2019s fraternity brother, argued for Limkaichong during the oral argument conducted on Aug. 26, instead of the counsel on record.\" CJ Puno is a member of the UP College of Law, Alpha Phi Beta fraternity. Biraogo accused Chief Justice Puno of delaying the release of the decision. \u201cMy suspicion is the Chief Justice may have a hand in this irregularity. These circumstances led me to believe the Chief Justice may have been dishonest in his dealings\u2026and may prejudice the faith of people in the judiciary. I was likewise informed (by an unnamed SC) employee that (Puno) was the one who prodded the members to hold oral arguments,\u201d Biraogo added. \u201cThe said decision was dated July 15, 2008 but what is irregular and maybe anomalous is that it was not promulgated until now. In fact what is questionable is an oral argument was conducted on August 26, 2008 despite a decision already made on July 15, 2008,\" he further said.\nThis is not the first time that the Philippine judiciary had been involved in massive corruption. In the recent GSIS-Meralco bribery case, the High Court dismissed Associate Justice Vicente Q. Roxas, punished Associate Justice Jose L. Sabio, Jr. with 2 months suspension, and reprimanded 2 other CA Justices. In September 2006, Atty. Romeo Roxas accused Justice Minita Chico-Nazario of issuing a ruling for certain considerations, and calling the Supreme Court a \u201cdispenser of injustice\u201d. Roxas said her decision ordering him and one Santiago Pastor to return more than P17 million to Antonio de Zuzuarregui Jr. was wrong and unjust. Roxas told Nazario: to \u201csleep well if you still can\u201d and that she would be judged by the \u201cSupreme Dispenser of Justice.\u201d Roxas was cited for indirect contempt and fined P30,000.\nIn April 2007, Philippine Court of Appeals then Presiding Justice Ruben Reyes ordered an investigation and a regular auditing and inventory of temporary restraining orders (TROs) issued by the 69 CA Justices. Reyes stated: \u201cI will order a monthly or quarterly inventory of TROs, for transparency and to watch the movements of the so-called Dirty Dozen [the 12 most corrupt CA justices].\u201d CJ Reynato Puno said that Ombudsman Merceditas Gutierrez had not yet submitted the list and the Supreme Court was waiting for its delivery amid her formal investigation against the \u201cDirty Dozen.\u201d\nIn September 2007, Lawyer Victor de la Serna accused Justice Dante Tinga of accepting a P10-million bribe in the Johnny Chan versus Carmelita Fudot lawsuit, regarding a land located in Doljo, Panglao, Bohol.

The move has been met with anger and claims of cover up by the opposition parties. The news was broken by Jacobs Engineering, the California based company who bought the government's shares, and by a single line comment on the British Nuclear Fuels (BNFL) website. British Nuclear Fuels plc, a government owned company, held one third of the shares in AWE's operating company, with British firm Serco and American defence contractor Lockheed Martin each having a further third. The Atomic Weapons Establishment, which is based in Aldermaston, produces the warheads for the Lockheed Martin Trident D5 missile used by the Royal Navy's Vanguard class ballistic missile submarines.\nThe details of the deal have not been published, though opposition Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman Vince Cable suggested the deal was \"probably in the millions rather than the billions\", echoing fears that the firm may have been undervalued in its sale. Both the methods of the deal's announcement and the deal itself have been attacked by both opposition parties. There is anger in some quarters over the deal being revealed on a website rather than through the commons, the Liberal Democrats describing such a failure as staggering. The Liberal Democrats have also raised the issue of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, their defence spokesman Nick Harvey questioned \"The whole argument used for Britain having a separate weapons establishment is that this is required by the non-proliferation treaty, as technology sharing is not allowed. We must therefore query the rationale of a US company having a majority shareholding in AWE. How does this all square?\"\nThe Tories have also raised doubts over the decision, with Commons Public Accounts Select Committee member Richard Bacon suggesting that they may involve the National Audit Office. The Tory defence spokesperson, Gerald Howarth, commented that the firm was \"critical\" and said \"What I'm absolutely determined is that the United Kingdom should have total control of its independent nuclear capability\". Mr Howarth criticised handing over control to American firms, saying that the British people would want to know \"their politicians are in command of the research and development of this capability\".\nThe Ministry of Defence has defended the decision, saying \"the UK Government not AWE that sets the UK's nuclear policy\". The MoD also assured that the sale would have no affect on the independence of the British nuclear deterrent or on the safe operation of AWE. These statements have been backed up by news from the government that it has retained the ability to re-assert control over the site should it feel the need, due to a \"Special Share\"."}

The new motion would extend the rights guaranteed in the UDHR to homosexual and transgender people, 60 years after the original declaration was made. It was backed by France and the Netherlands, and has been signed by sixty-six countries including Mexico, Israel, Australia and Japan. \nThe refusal of the U.S. to sign the non-binding declaration was prompted by its own legal questions. Officials said signing the declaration would cause a conflict between state and federal governments because of laws already in place. American military personnel are not allowed to be openly gay, and in some states landlords and employers are allowed to discriminate against a sexual orientation. \nCarolyn Vadino, a spokeswoman for the U.S. mission to the U.N., said the refusal to sign the declaration does not mean the U.S. believes human rights violations related to sexual orientation are acceptable. \nGay rights activists in the U.S. and around the world, however, expressed anger at the United States' decision, with one international group calling the stance \"appalling.\" Former chief U.S. spokesman to the U.N. Richard Grenell said the United States' reasons for not signing the declaration were \"ridiculous,\" adding that \"the U.S. lack of support on this issue only dims our once bright beacon of hope and freedom for those who are persecuted and oppressed.\"\nRepresentatives around the world have also spoken out against the U.S. decision, and in support of the updated declaration. Dutch Foreign Affairs Minister Maxime Verhagen said the declaration was purely symbolic but that he would accept nothing less than for \"human rights apply to all people in all places at all times.\" U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay discussed concerns over the countries that have not signed the document, comparing anti-gay laws to Apartheid laws and saying that stigma was to blame for unpunished violence and discrimination.\nThe declaration has met opposition from several Arab and African countries, which issued a joint statement condemning the attempt at \"the social normalization and possibly the legalization of deplorable acts.\" One Syrian official said it would lead to more pedophilia. In many of these countries homosexuality is a criminal offense and, in seven nations, homosexuality carries a death sentence.\nThe Vatican has rejected the declaration as well, saying it appreciates the efforts made to end the criminal status of gays in many countries but that the declaration \"gives rise to uncertainty in the law and challenges existing human rights norms.\" The vague definitions of 'gender identity' and 'sexual orientation', it said, would undermine existing and future laws."}

Two seconds after the bird strike the decision was taken to abort takeoff, but the jet was unable to stop in the distance left to it. V1 is the maximum speed at which takeoff can be safely aborted.\nThe plane exited the runway and broke into three main pieces. None of the five crew members was injured.\nThe investigation also confirmed that there was no structural failure prior to impact. The remnants of a kestrel were found in the engine. Flight K4-207 was carrying mail for DHL at the time, and severely damaged the Instrument Landing System during the crash, taking the equipment out of action for repairs. Both the runway and a nearby railway line were closed.\nEarlier this month, Kalitta announced cost-cutting measures in response to the current financial crisis.

The system is used to filter out child pornography, although Wikileaks points out it \"can be used to censor anything\" and claims \"most sites on the list are still censored (i.e must be on the current list), even though many have clearly changed owners or were possibly even wrongly placed on the list.\"\n\"Wikinews\" was able to contact Wikileaks. We discussed the unusual leak with them, and the results are published here.\nWe asked if Wikileaks was worried about the criminal implications of linking to so much illegal content, but they were not. They said that it was \"politically untenable\" to prosecute them, pointing out that Wikileaks is hosted in many different countries across the globe.\nWe asked them if they were \"concerned about the possibility of censorship in the UK, Denmark, Finland etc.?\" \"No,\" Wikileaks told us \"We welcome it.\" \"Wikinews\" wondered if this was because of the Streisand effect, but Wikileaks said it was \"because it will demonstrate how censorship systems are abused.\"\n\"Wikinews\" asked Wikileaks why they didn't simply post a list of the sites which they felt were legal and add that all the others contained child porn, but Wikileaks felt \"that would not be a fair representation of the material we obtained.\" After seeking clarification, \"Wikinews\" was told \"the question is not what we need to be told. The question is what we need not to be told and who decides. Secret censorship systems are unaccountable and dangerous.\"\n\"Wikinews\" then asked why they didn't leave the full list available, but mark which sites they felt should not be censored. \"We have better things to do,\" was the response given. So how would Wikileaks suggest dealing with child porn?\n\"Block financial transactions after due process. It's easy to set up servers. It is not so easy to set up merchant accounts.\" And what would due process be? \"Due process would involve sending a letter to the owner of the merchant account with the accusation and giving them a right to be heard and an appeal process. The banks are politically a lot more powerful than the internet industry so this hasn't happened.\"\nAnd should funds in these accounts be seized straight away, or simply frozen until a judge or similar clears their release? \"If the accounts are in-jurisdiction, they should be frozen and released or not at the end of the process.

The loss of the Boeing 737 killed all 121 people on board in what was the deadliest air disaster for both Greece and Cyprus.\n\"The charge sheet was submitted to the court [in Nicosia] today [Tuesday], and a response to the charges has been set for February 26,\" said deputy attorney general Akis Papasavvas. The names of those charged were not released, and they face charges of manslaughter and causing death by a reckless, thoughtless or dangerous act, which carry life and four year terms respectively. They all worked for Helios.\n\"The charges concern two of the three most serious offences under the Cyprus penal code,\" said Papasavvas. Families of the victims, who had already called for criminal prosecutions, are still carrying out a civil action against the Cypriot civil aviation authority and airframer Boeing. Helios closed in 2006, having been renamed Ajet Airways.\nThe unresponsive aircraft, supposed to be flying between Lanarca to Prague, entered Greek airspace, where it was intercepted by two F-16 fighter jets on August 14, 2005.\nThe F-16 pilots reported the airliner's pilots were slumped over the controls. After flying on autopilot for two hours the aircraft crashed near Athens despite the efforts of a flight attendant, who was training to become a pilot, to take control and save the jet.\nThe subsequent investigation discovered that the pilots failed to adequately monitor the pressurisation system. The plane lost cabin pressure and hypoxia caused the incapacitation of the passengers and flight crew. It is thought that the conscious flight attendant had used multiple crew oxygen cylinders to outlast the others on board. Investigators also believe that the equipment had been left in the wrong setting after testing by maintenance engineers and never checked before flight.\nAfter failing to resuscitate the pilot-in-command, the trainee pilot turned off the autopilot and attempted an emergency landing at Athens International Airport, which the aircraft had been circling in a holding pattern awaiting human input. However, the aircraft ran out of fuel before reaching the runway."}

PricewaterhouseCoopers also announced that TimeC 1215 limited had bought 118 of the stores for an undisclosed fee. TimeC 1215 is backed by David Charlton, chief executive of The Officers Club. This deal saves around 900 jobs. The Officers Club began in the early 1990s in Sunderland and has headquarters at Cramlington, Northumberland.\nAlso on December 23 an international retailer of coffee, tea and various other hot beverages, Whittard of Chelsea, was placed into administration with Ernst &amp; Young. Its owners were the Icelandic investment company Baugur, who were hit by turmoil after Iceland's banking crisis. Ernst &amp; Young stated that the company was then sold for an undisclosed sum to EPIC private equity partners. Whittard of Chelsea was founded in 1886 by Walter Whittard, a merchant from London, and now has some 130 retail stores. The deal saves around 950 jobs.\nOn Christmas Eve, December 24, the UK's largest independent entertainment retailer, Zavvi, went into administration due the loss of its supplier and not being able to pay its debts. Until 2007 Zavvi had been a part of Sir Richard Branson's Virgin Megastores, but became independent due to a management buyout. Zavvi's supplier had been Entertainment UK (EUK), which had entered administration itself, along with other parts of its parent company Woolworths Group, in November 2008. The companies within \"Zavvi UK\", which is in administration, are Zavvi Group Limited, Zavvi Retail Limited, Piccadilly Entertainment Stores Limited, VR Service Limited, Ablegrand Limited and Ablegrand 2 Limited. Tom Jack, Simon Allport and Alan Hudson of Ernst &amp; Young LLP have been appointed joint administrators, and Zavvi will continue to trade as a buyer is found. Ernst &amp; Young said Zavvi Guernsey will be liquidated, while Zavvi Ireland was not subject to any formal insolvency proceedings. At the time of administration Zavvi had 114 stores in the UK and 11 in Ireland, where they employed a total of 3,415 staff.

In Harbin, city ice sculptors and organizers are building the giant Father Christmas, a 160 meters (525 ft) long and 24 meters high sculpture. It centers on an enormous face of Santa, complete with flowing beard and hat.\nTang Guangjun, one of the sculptors, complained of the effects of global warming and hazardous conditions saying \"it is even bigger and higher than last year's, and more difficult. The weather swings between warm and cold, so it becomes very wet and slippery on the ice. It is very dangerous for us.\" He added that \"its huge size and unseasonably warm temperatures have made the job especially challenging.\" Organizers even have to use artificial snow.\nThe mid-December to early February ice festival which officially begins on January 5, has consistently increased in size over the years, with more talented artists involved and more impressive techniques and pieces on show. Ice sculpture decoration ranges from the modern technology of lasers to traditional ice lanterns. The climate of Heilongjiang is very cold and ice is plentiful. Objects of all sizes appear, up to and including building-sized pieces. In Harbin, winter temperatures can drop to below minus 35 degrees Celsius (- 31 F). According to Jia Yan, director of the local tourism bureau, about 800,000 tourists, 90 per cent of them Chinese, are expected to visit the ice festival this year. \nFather Christmas or \"Shengdan laoren\" (literally \"The Old Man of Christmas\") is a name used in many English speaking countries, for the gift-bringing figure of Christmas. Although \"Father Christmas\" and \"Santa Claus\" have for all practical purposes been merged, historically the characters were different.\nThe symbolic personification of Christmas as a merry old figure begins in the early 17th century, in the context of resistance to Puritan criticism of observation of the Christmas feast. He is \"old\" because of the antiquity of the feast itself, which its defenders saw as a good old Christian custom that should be kept. Allegory was popular at the time, and so \"old Christmas\" was given a voice to protest his exclusion, along with the form of a rambunctious, jolly old man.\nThe earliest recorded personification of Christmas appears to be Ben Jonson's creation in \"Christmas his Masque\" dating from December 1616, in which Christmas appears \"attir'd in round Hose, long Stockings, a close Doublet, a high crownd Hat with a Broach, a long thin beard, a Truncheon, little Ruffes, white shoes, his Scarffes, and Garters tyed crosse\", and announces \"Why Gentlemen, doe you know what you doe? ha! would you ha'kept me out? Christmas, old Christmas?\" Later, in a masque by Thomas Nabbes, \"The Springs Glorie\" produced in 1638, \"Christmas\" appears as \"an old reverend gentleman in furred gown and cap\". The character continued to appear over the next 250 years, appearing as Sir Christmas, Lord Christmas, or Father Christmas, the last becoming the most common. \nAccording to early Christian origins Saint Nicholas of Myra is the primary inspiration for the Christian figure of Santa Claus. He was a 4th-century Greek Christian bishop of Myra in Lycia, a province of the Byzantine Anatolia, now in Turkey. "}

The rescuers, in the number of 565, managed to pull out alive 21 residents of the building; about twenty people are still unaccounted for, the Ministry spokesmen said. The search was regularly suspended so the rescuers could hear voices of victims still trapped under the rubble, the AFP reports.\nOlexander Mazilin, head of the regional branch of the Emergency Situations Ministry, said that 26 out of 27 bodies have been identified so far.

The President also assured that the state would give the victims all possible support. Victor Yushchenko thanked to the Government and local authorities for their quick reaction to the explosion; on behalf of the state he thanked to all who offered help and condolence. \nWith another special decree, the President announced December 26 the day of national mourning in Ukraine. \"On the day of mourning national flags will be half-masted all over Ukraine on residential houses and buildings, housing state authorities, local self-government bodies, state enterprises, agencies and organisations.

Covina is a city in Los Angeles County, California about 22 miles (35 km) east of downtown Los Angeles.\nAccording to local police, the Christmas party at the 1100 block of East Knollcrest Drive was attended by about 25 people. Trend News Agency said that the gunman fired two semi-automatic handguns and used an apparently home-made pressurized device to spread some kind of accelerant. As the guests tried in vain to escape, the gunman used his 'present' to spray inflammable liquid that started the raging blaze. Reports from the scene said Molotov cocktails were also used by the madman. \nMedia reports said the gunman was plotting vengeance against his ex-wife. Prime suspect, Bruce Jeffrey Pardo, age 45, six-foot-three-inch, 250 pound (1.9 meter, 113 kilogram), an electrical engineer, is long time Roman Catholic church usher and a laid-off aerospace worker. He worked with ITT Electronic Systems, Radar Systems, in Van Nuys from February 2005 to July 2008, and as an engineer at Northrop Grumman for five months in 2005, according to Court records. He had also worked for about nine years at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena until 1994.\nPardo's ex-sister-in-law, who escaped from the Covina house alive with her injured daughter, called 911. Police on Friday released her 911 audio.\nMsnbc.com has reported that Pardo \"has brown hair and blue eyes, and known to frequent La Crescenta and La Verne.\" Court records reveal that Mr Pardo's wife acrimoniously divorced him last September. The divorce decree was finalized December 18. Until earlier this year, he lived in the Sylmar house with his ex-wife and her three children. The marriage lasted barely a year. However, Pardo held no criminal record and had no history of violence.\nThere is some speculation that the divorce may have been caused by Pardo concealing a paraplegic child from a previous relationship. Matthew, his nine-year-old son, by another former girlfriend, Elena Lucano, became brain damaged when he fell into a backyard swimming pool on Jan. 6, 2001. Pardo kept this child a secret from his wife. Pardo owed her $10,000 as part of the divorce settlement, according to court documents that detailed a bitter split. He also lost a dog he doted on and did not get back a valuable wedding ring. Pardo complained in a court declaration that Sylvia Pardo was living with her parents, not paying rent, and had spent lavishly on a luxury car, gambling trips to Las Vegas, meals at fine restaurants, massages and golf lessons.\nAfter the mass murder, Pardo put on his street clothes and drove his rental Dodge Caliber car to the house of his brother, Jimmy Pardo, in Sylmar, approximately 30 miles away from the crime scene, where he committed suicide from a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head. His brother was not present in the home and he broke inside to enter in. It was believed that Pardo intended to flee to Canada by plane as he had bought an airline ticket to a flight there from Los Angeles to Moline, Illinois. However due to suffering from severe third-degree burns on both arms stemming from the blaze, he decided to go against the initial plan. \nPolice had found $17,000 cling-wrapped on his legs inside a girdle, the car key, and his rental car that had been parked on Herrick Avenue, one block from his brother's house, which had been rigged by remnants of his Santa suit that would ignite a flame and detonate the car with black powder if removed. Also recovered from the scene were four 13-round capacity handguns that were each empty, and at least 200 rounds of ammunition. Suggesting that what had been inside the car was being treated as a threat, police fired an incendiary device into it, destroying and burning it.\nThe police found on early Thursday, Mr Pardo bore a single gunshot wound to the head. According to LA County coroner's official Ed Winter, the bodies found in the ashes were \"extremely charred and burned.\" All three of Sylvia Pardo's children \u2014 Selina, Sal and Amanda \u2014 survived. According to the Scott Nord, the Ortega family lawyer, \"the entire family was wiped out, and there's basically like 16 orphans.\"\nThree other party guests have injuries, according to police. A 16-year-old girl was shot in the back, and an eight-year-old girl suffered facial gunshot wounds that were not life-threatening, while a 20-year-old woman had a broken ankle, after jumping from a second-story window, the police specified. About 80 firefighters put off the fire that soared fifteen metres (40 to 50 feet) high for more than one hour. The police discovered two handguns at the scene, and found two more in the in-laws' house. Media reports on Friday said the 16-year-old daughter of Sylvia Pardo was released from Los Angeles County-USC Medical Center. \nMeanwhile, investigators served a search warrant at Pardo's Montrose house, where they retrieved evidence of high-octane racing fuel, five empty boxes for semi-automatic handguns, as well as two shotguns.\nCovina police Lt. Pat Buchanan on Saturday said they are looking for Pardo's rented gray 1999 RAV4, with California license plate 5RYD562. Police have found the second rental car Saturday night in a Glendale, California but found no bombs nor any explosives.\nThe police also revealed Saturday the names of nine people missing since the Christmas Eve massacre occurred. They are Pardo's ex-wife, Sylvia Pardo, 43; her parents, Joseph Ortega, 80, and Alicia Ortega, 70; Alicia Ortiz, 46, and her son, Michael Ortiz, 17; Sylvia's brother, Charles Ortega, 50, and his wife, Cheri, 45; another brother, James Ortega, 52, and his wife, Teresa, 51, according to Lt. Buchanan. \"Hopefully, we'll get positive identifications early next week,\" Covina Police Chief Kim Raney said. \nA murder-suicide is an act in which an individual kills one or more other persons immediately before, or at the same time as, killing him or herself. According to the psychiatrist Karl A. Menninger, murder-suicide or murder and suicide are interchangeable acts - suicide sometimes forestalling murder, and vice versa."}

Seven struck Ashkelon, killing one person, while another suffered serious injuries, and four others were moderately wounded when their house was hit. They were rushed to the Soroka hospital in Beersheva. \nAccording to the IDF, Hamas militants had further launched more than 110 rockets since Saturday, IDF says.

Foxsports quotes a Telmex release as saying \"The Telmex Team can confirm that Carlos Slim Helu has not bought the Honda F1 team nor is holding any negotiations to do so. Therefore all information related to this subject has no basis and is completely false.\" Slim is the CEO and President of Telmex, a telecommunications provider in Mexico, and claims to be the world's second richest person.\nThe initial reports suggested that a team had already been chosen including Jenson Button and rookie Bruno Senna as its drivers for 2009. Senna, who is the nephew of triple world champion Ayrton Senna, was said to be replacing veteran Rubens Barrichello. Slim is already sponsoring Senna through Embratel, one of his group's subsidiaries. Claims that Slim paid a visit to the Honda team facility in Northamptonshire in December also seem incorrect following a comment from team principal, Ross Brawn, in London's \"Daily Telegraph\" that \"We would love it if it were true but it's pure speculation from various members of the media.\" A further quote stated that \"It's just been one of those rumours which has developed a life of its own.\" \nHonda withdrew from Formula One recently following a 40% slump in its retail car sales and an estimated budget in excess of US$350m annually. The recent season was not successful for Honda which saw them finish ninth in the constructors' championship, only beating Team India and Super Aguri, who each failed to register a single championship point in 2008. \nAlmost a week ago reports began circulating that Slim was interested and that other suitors may include Vijay Mallya and David Richards. Mallya took an active role in Formula One in 2008 with his purchase of the Spyker F1 team for US$130m. The first year was a tough one for Mallya and the team with constant failure to finish and not a single championship point gained. Richards is reported to have already met with potential investors in the Middle East. He has the experience as former team principal for BAR and Benetton Formula One motor racing teams."}

Despite the ruling party's call to boycott, the Tain local election officer also announced that Atta-Mills obtained 19,566 votes in Friday's special election there, while Nana Akufo-Addo had only 2,053 ballots.\nIn the parliamentary elections, Atta Mills\u2019s NDC won 114 seats to the NPP\u2019s 107. Minor parties and independent candidates won seven seats while two are still being contested.\nPresident John Kufuor appealed for sobriety and urged the candidates to accept the official result.\nA presidential election was held in Ghana on 7 December 2008, at the same time as a parliamentary election. Eight candidates contested the first round of voting.\nGhana's electoral commission announced on December 10 that a run-off election must be held on 28 December, 2008 for the Ghanaian presidency. The commission said that the New Patriotic Party (NPP) candidate Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo won 49.13% of the vote, slightly more than the other main candidate, John Atta Mills of the National Democratic Congress (NDC), who obtained 47.92%. However, neither candidate reached the 50% mark needed to declare an outright winner to succeed President John Kufuor, who will step down after two terms.\nTurnout on election day was very high. Out of some 8.6 million votes cast, more than 200,000, or 2.4% of the full total, were rejected. Overall voter turnout in the election was 69.52%.\nThe second round was to be rerun on 2 January 2009 in the Tain District due to ballot papers irregularities. As the number of voters in Tain, which has a constituency of about 53,000 eligible voters, exceeded Atta Mills' margin of victory without the results, the Election Commission stated it would not announce Atta Mills as the winner until after the election rerun in Tain. \nThe NPP sought to delay voting in Tain as it claimed that \"the atmosphere in the rural district was not conducive to a free and fair election\", but the court said it would only hear the case on January 5, denying the NPP an injunction. The NPP then proceeded to call for a voting boycott, for which it was criticized by civil groups.\nOn December 21, 2006, former Vice-President John Atta-Mills, who unsuccessfully ran as the National Democratic Congress (NDC) presidential candidate in 2000 and 2004, was overwhelmingly elected by NDC as its candidate for the 2008 presidential election.\nFormer Foreign Minister Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo was elected as the 2008 presidential candidate of the governing New Patriotic Party (NPP) at a party congress on December 23, 2007.

Gonzalez to investigate and charge the people involved in an alleged drug bribery attempt involving wealthy Filipino families. The president also instructed the chair of the Dangerous Drugs Board, Vicente Sotto III to keep in custody the drug suspects, the so-called 'Alabang Boys'. This pending the DOJ's reinvestigation of the alleged P50-million bribe mess.\nIn September, Richard Santos Brodett, age 25, Jorge Jordana Joseph, age 22, and Joseph Ramirez Tecson, age 23, members of the \"Alabang Boys\", were arrested in a series of buy-bust operations in Alabang, Muntinlupa City, and Cubao in Quezon City. 60 ecstasy tablets, small bags of marijuana and cocaine sachets were taken from the suspects by the drug agents. The three suspects underwent the DOJ's preliminary investigation, but the drug case was dismissed by a draft resolution signed by 2 prosecutors from the National Prosecution Service on December 2.\nIn the challenged resolution, State Prosecutor John Resado, with the recommending approval of Senior State Prosecutor Philip I. Kimpo and Chief State Prosecutor Jovencito Zu\u00f1o, noted that the police operatives conducted illegal arrests and unlawful warrantless searches on the vehicles of the three suspects. In addition, Joseph was \u201cunder the control of the PDEA agents without the presence of any counsel when information against respondent Tecson was extracted from him,\u201d it added.\nThe PDEA has accused the suspect's family members of attempting to pay a 50 million Philippine peso bribe to one of the DOJ prosecutors handling the drug case; in exchange the case was to be dismissed. PDEA Special Enforcement Service head Major Ferdinand Marcelino has revealed that the 50 million peso bribe offer to a DOJ prosecutor was merely the first attempt of three. The Tecson family reportedly offered him 3 million pesos which was later raised to 20 million for the release of the suspects. PDEA Legal and Prosecution Service lawyer Alvaro Lazaro affirmed Marcelino's accusations, which, however, were all denied by the suspects' families.\nThe Chief State Prosecutor, Jovencito Zu\u00f1o, categorically dismissed accusations that 50 million pesos had changed hands, and that he and the prosecutors had been bribed. \"It's not true. That's a big lie. They're just speculating,\" he said. Zu\u00f1o has also alleged that the factual findings were first reviewed by state prosecutors Philip Quimpo and Misael Ladaga. The Justice Secretary has ordered the NBI to investigate not only the government prosecutors but also the PDEA.\nAccording to PDEA chief, Ret. Gen. Dionisio Santiago, the \"Alabang Boys\" - Richard Santos Brodett, Jorge Jordana Joseph and Joseph Ramirez Tecson - are part of an international drug network. \"This is a big group, and they use the Internet to get drugs from America. This operation may lead to a bigger one. They (Alabang Boys) are second in line. It's hard to penetrate the second line,\" Santiago explained. (DOJ) Secretary Raul M. Gonzalez on Thursday, however, has asked PDEA Director General Dionisio Santiago to submit evidence to show that money changed hands or had been paid to DOJ prosecutors handling the case amid the pending NBI probe of the matter.\nMeanwhile, The Philippines Congress is set to hold Congressional hearings on the case with a view to introducing legislation. \"This is a big scandal involving a government agency,\" said House vice chairman of committee on illegal drugs, Representative Antonio Cuenco of Cebu City. He has said that the House of Representatives' probe will begin on January 5. The three suspects are still detained at the PDEA Quezon City detention centre.\nThe Senate of the Philippines is also set to conduct hearing on the bribery mess. According to Dangerous Drugs Board chair Vicente \"Tito\" Sotto III, Sen. Gregorio \"Gringo\" Honasan, chair of the Senate committee on Public Order and Illegal Drugs, has agreed to lead a Senate inquiry investigating the 50-million peso drug bribe.\nIn a related drug bust operation, La Union Rep. Tomas Dumpit said that the buy-bust in his province had a 'similar ending.' \"That's very possible just like the case in Naguilian, La Union where a shabu (methamphetamine hydrochloride) laboratory was discovered in Barangay Bimotobot, Naguilian, La Union worth one trillion pesos but it was dismissed by the DOJ.\" In July, a \"shabu\" laboratory was searched by the PDEA and the local police, who discovered eight truckloads of equipment and chemicals that could produce 180,000 kilograms of the prohibited drugs. La Union Bishop Artemio Rillera has recently petitioned the President to re-open the cases. On November 12, the DoJ three-member prosecution panel dismissed the cases against former Dagupan police chief Supt. Dionicio Borromeo, four policemen and the shabu laboratory lot owner. Because of the 'Alabang Boys' bribery mess, President Arroyo on Tuesday, ordered the reinvestigation of the shabu laboratory case.\nThis is not the first time that the Philippine judiciary and government had been involved in massive corruption. In the recent GSIS-Meralco bribery case, the High Court dismissed Associate Justice Vicente Q. Roxas, punished Associate Justice Jose L. Sabio, Jr. with 2 months suspension, and reprimanded 2 other CA Justices. In September 2006, Atty. Romeo Roxas accused Justice Minita Chico-Nazario of issuing a ruling for certain considerations, and calling the Supreme Court a \u201cdispenser of injustice\u201d. Roxas said her decision ordering him and one Santiago Pastor to return more than 17 million Philippine pesos to Antonio de Zuzuarregui Jr. was wrong and unjust. Roxas told Nazario: to \u201csleep well if you still can\u201d and that she would be judged by the \u201cSupreme Dispenser of Justice.\u201d Roxas was cited for indirect contempt and fined 30,000 Philippine pesos.\nIn April 2007, Philippine Court of Appeals then Presiding Justice Ruben Reyes has ordered an investigation and a regular auditing and inventory of temporary restraining orders (TROs) issued by the 69 CA Justices. Reyes stated: \u201cI will order a monthly or quarterly inventory of TROs, for transparency and to watch the movements of the so-called Dirty Dozen [the 12 most corrupt CA justices].\u201d CJ Reynato Puno said that Ombudsman Merceditas Gutierrez had not yet submitted the list and the Supreme Court was waiting for its delivery amid her formal investigation against the \u201cDirty Dozen.\u201d\nIn September 2007, Lawyer Victor de la Serna has accused Justice Dante Tinga of accepting a 10-million bribe Philippine pesos in the Johnny Chan versus Carmelita Fudot lawsuit, regarding a land located in Doljo, Panglao, Bohol. De la Serna alleged that in the September 26, 2007 meeting, Chan, owner of Bellevue Hotel, paid Tinga 10 million Philippine pesos in exchange for a favorable decision. On September 13, 2007, Tinga penned a decision in favor of Chan\u2019s Cattleya Land Inc., over Fudot, client of De La Serna. The court, however, upheld Tinga, and fined De La Serna 30,000 Philippine pesos for indirect contempt.\nIn September 2007, Justice Consuelo Ynares-Santiago has denied charges that she received 10-million Philippine pesos (US$ 224,000) bribe money (as published by The Daily Tribune, Malaya newspaper's Amado Macasaet and Newsbreak, the previous week). \nIn January 2005, and December 2006, Philippines Social Weather Stations has released the results of its 2 surveys on corruption in the judiciary. It has reported that: a) \"like 1995, 1/4 of lawyers said many/very many judges are corrupt. But (49%) stated that a judges received bribes, just 8% of lawyers admitted they reported the bribery, because they could not prove it. [Tables 8-9]; judges, however, said, just 7% call many/very many judges as corrupt[Tables 10-11] ;b) Judges see some corruption; proportions who said - many/very many corrupt judges or justices: 17% in reference to RTC judges, 14% to MTC judges, 12% to Court of Appeals justices, 4% i to Shari'a Court judges, 4% to Sandiganbayan justices and 2% in reference to Supreme Court justices [Table 15].\"\nAccording to the 2008 Political and Economic Risk Consultancy (PERC) report, the Philippines, Thailand, Indonesia and China are considered among the most corrupt Asian economies. \u201cThe Philippines is a sad case when it comes to corruption, and is probably no worse than in places like Indonesia and Thailand,\u201d the report added. PERC has revealed that \"the Philippines scored 9.0 out of a possible 10 points under a grading system used by PERC under which zero is the best score and 10 the worst.\"\nMeanwhile, the Supreme Court of the Philippines last week, has affirmed the conviction and 40 years imprisonment sentence of Zeng Wa Shui, a Chinese citizen and Maribel Lagman, his Filipino partner. On March 14, 1996, both had possession, in Angeles City, Pampanga, of more than 600 kilos of liquid shabu and more than 1,600 kilos of ephedrine hydrochloride, a main ingredient in the production of the drug."}

It was the first time Australia has been beaten on home soil since 1992 when the West Indies beat Australia by 2-1 in the five match series. It was a see-sawing game that had both teams appear to be on top at times and only hours later struggling. The turning point came late on day three when Jean-Paul Duminy solidified the South African innings going on to eventually make a personal high score of 166. His partnership of 180 with Dale Steyn, who was dropped three times, became a frustration to Australia.\nAustralia commenced proceedings and was eventually dismissed for 394 in its first innings. The innings finally ended in the first session of day two when Peter Siddle was caught in second slip by de Villiers of a thick edge from a Kallis seamer. It was a sound score after Australia again started slowly losing for 8 when the score was 21 continuing a run of bad scores for Hayden this year. \nCaptain Ricky Ponting again was the mainstay of the innings with a hard fought century, finally falling to a catch by Amla of Paul Harris. This was Pontings 38th century and now only three behind Sachin Tendulkar world record. Middle order batsman Michael Clarke struggled early with slow scoring and remained not out on 88 of a 208 balls including only four boundaries and a solitary six for Clarke.\nSouth African speedster Dale Steyn again proved his ranking as worlds second best bowler taking five wickets including Simon Katich and Michael Hussey. In the second day morning session he removed Brett Lee and Mitchell Johnson in the same over before taking his final wicket of Nathan Hauritz.Steyne finished with 5 for 87 and was well supported by Ntini (2/108) with Kallis, Harris and Morkel each taking one.\nSouth Africa's run chase hit trouble with the loss of early wickets in its first innings. The trouble started when Neil McKenzie was bowled by Peter Siddle for a duck in the second over of the day. Amla showed some early promise before playing a loose shot to be caught by Andrew Symonds of the bowling of Mitchell Johnson in the eighth over. South African veteran Jaques Kallis provided support for Smith to carry the score to 109 before being caught behind of Hauritz. \nReturning from the lunch break Australia took control with three quick wickets in nine overs. First to go was Smith caught behind of Siddle who was gaining in confidence. Only Smith managed to assert control scoring 62 from 113 balls, he has been the mainstay of the South African batting line-up this tour scoring strongly in each innings. Soon after de villiers and Boucher's wickets fell leaving South Africa 6-141 still trailing Australia by more than 250 runs and attempting to avoid the follow-on.\nIn the final session middle order players Morne Morkel and Jean-Paul Duminy steadying the innings with partnership of 43 before Morkel was bowled by Johnson in his first ball of a new spell. Paul Harris joined Duminy and remained unbeaten on 8 at the close of play. South Africa finished the second day of play at 7/198 with Duminy the last of the recognized batters unbeaten on 34. Australia clearly held the advantage with a lead of almost 200 and only three wickets remaining. \nDay three would change the shape of the game with strong, determined batting from South Africa combined with lackluster bowling from Australia. Harris was out early on day three which brought pace bowler Dale Steyn to the wicket. His 76 of 191 balls was another personal best and despite being dropped three times looked every part the batsman.Duminy had total control of the bowlers and with Lee sitting on the sideline with suspected stress fractures of his heel, the bowling attack was limited and struggling. His innings of over seven hours included 340 balls, 18 boundaries , took the score from 6-141 to all out for 459, a lead of 65 runs. The falls of Duminys wicket late on day three meant Australia was required to face a tough three overs to close the day.\nAustralia began the fourth day with the goal of wiping out the deficit from their first innings and then set a target for South Africa to chase. Those plans quickly changed when Australia's opening combination of Hayden and Katich again failed with Hayden being caught by man of the moment Duminy on 23 from the bowling of Steyn. Katich fell two overs later and when Hussey was dismissed for only two in the 15th over Australia was in trouble and defending grimly at 3-49. First innings century maker, Ricky Ponting, and Michael Clarke steadied Australia and took the score to 145 when Clarke became Steyn's third wicket for the innings. Symonds, Haddin and Lee fell in quick succession with Australia reeling at 7-180 and only Ponting providing resistance. Ponting eventually fell for 99 having struggled through the nineties and then seemingly \"choked\" on an easy ball that should have brought up his century. Mitchell Johnson atoned for his first innings duck and supported Ponting well and continued his aggressive approach to finish on 43. Hauritz and Siddle offered little resistance and Australia was all out for 247 a lead of only 182 and more than a days play remaining.\nGraeme Smith commenced the run chase with his usual aggression making striking boundaries at will and finishing the days play at 25 after only six overs. Smith continued the same approach the following morning taking a total of ten boundaries in his score of 75 from only 95 balls. He had taken South Africa to a winning position and needing only 61 runs to win a historic test series. Neil McKenzie and Hashim Amla confidently closed the game finishing on 1-183 from only 48 overs.\nFor Australia the pain was magnified with key players Symonds and Lee unlikely to take further part in the series due to injury and should Australia lose the last test in Sydney they would not only lose the world number one spot, they would fall to number three behind India with the Protea's taking top place. The final game will be played in Sydney on the 3rd January."}

Lower house deputies approved the Motion of Confidence by a majority of 88 votes to 45, with no abstentions. \"Don't judge the government... by its intentions but by its results, but no results in the very short-term, judge us in 2011,\" Van Rompuy told the lawmakers.\nHerman A. Van Rompuy (herman van r\u0254mp\u0153y) had officially been invested on Tuesday as Belgium's third premier in a year by King Albert II. He addressed parliament Wednesday seeking quick economic measures. In his declaration, he urged the passage of bills to rejuvenate an ailing economy heading into deep recession and sought to resolve the 18 months political crisis after the country spent over nine months in caretaker rule. He also asked for full restoration of confidence amid the near-collapse of the country\u2019s two largest banks. \n\"The previous government proposed such a plan (pumping 2 billion euros or $2.84 billion, into the economy next year, part of a 200 billion euro EU-wide stimulus package). It must be enacted as soon as possible,\" Van Rompuy said. \"It is clear that in the coming weeks and months the government will take new initiatives to cope with the challenges that the crisis poses for the economy and employment,\" he added.\nIn his lower house of parliament speech, Van Rompuy also called for experts to testify in an unbiased parliamentary inquiry on Yves Leterme\u2019s cabinet's alleged attempt to influence the judges into allowing the breakup of Fortis, once Belgium's largest bank. \u201cThe investigation should be carried out serenely and without bias,\u201d he said.\nVan Rompuy, age 61, is a conservative Belgian Flemish politician and member of the CD&amp;V (formerly called CVP) who succeeds Yves Leterme. On December 28, 2008, he was asked by King Albert II to form a new Government after he was reluctant to take up the role of Prime Minister after the Leterme I government had fallen on 22 December 2008 due to the bank bailout scandal. \nThe Van Rompuy I Government became the new federal government of Belgium on December 30. It comprises 15 ministers and seven secretaries of state. Eighteen of the 22 ministers served in the same posts in Prime Minister Yves Leterme's government. Vietnam Prime Minister Nguy\u1ec5n T\u1ea5n D\u0169ng on Friday has sent congratulatory messages to the new Premier.\nPrime Minister Yves Leterme offered the resignation of his government on December 18 to King Albert after a crisis erupted surrounding the sale of troubled Fortis bank to BNP Paribas. Leterme, Justice Minister Jo Vandeurzen, and Didier Reynders were accused of violating the separation of powers and exerting improper influence by trying to influence the Court of Appeals; this accusation was made by the First Chairman of the Court of Cassation. Three days later the resignation was accepted by the king.\nMeanwhile, the Flemish opposition led by Flemish nationalist NVA party, Jan Jambon, challenged the legitimacy of Van Rompuy's government, calling it \"a government which does not represent a majority of the Flemish people\". Other opposition parties also questioned the created \"Fortisgate\" parliamentary commission of enquiry alleging it was a scheme to acquit Leterme. \nThe Kingdom of Belgium (\u02c8b\u025bld\u0292\u0259m) is a country in northwest Europe.

Although the report finds the accident was impossible to survive, it still faulted a number of design issues with the astronauts' equipment.\nThe accident investigation report was released in 2003, the year of the crash. During launch on January 16, the spacecraft's wing was holed when a chunk of foam detached and struck it. The shuttle then broke up on re-entry on February 1 over Texas, killing the seven on board.\nThis new report reveals details of what happened to the astronauts during the accident sequence, although some parts have remained confidential to the victims' families. The report reveals that within seconds of the breakup commencing the crew became unconscious due to the rapid depressurization and that they never regained consciousness prior to their deaths.\nThe report notes that the cabin began spinning wildly, causing some of the astronauts' helmets to come off. The report noted that most on board were secured only by lap harnesses that offered no restraint to the upper body and were not designed to cope with sideways motion, meaning \"lethal trauma\" was caused by the rotation. However, the report was unable to determine whether the astronauts had died from oxygen deprivation or the extreme nature of their injuries.\nThe pressure suits the crew wore, introduced after the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster, were criticised as the crew could not keep their visors down throughout re-entry due to a design limitation that would have caused excess levels of oxygen to be present had they done so, leaving the suits unsealed. The gloves also made many tasks difficult or impossible. When the accident occurred, three people were not wearing gloves, one was not wearing a helmet, and none had their visors down. The helmets also did not conform to the heads of the wearers.\nUpon disintegration, the occupants were exposed to extreme heat and high friction from re-entry. The astronauts likely died very quickly, and were probably dead by the time \"Columbia\" broke apart. \nThe report added that although the crew all wore parachutes, they had to be activated by the crew \u2014 impossible as they were unconscious. The report concluded that future spacecraft require sturdier construction and better restraints, while safety devices should be automatic. NASA is designing better suits and helmets.\nExternal links.\n "}

He claimed that the recapture of Kilinochchi on Friday is a unparalleled victory against terrorism and separatism. \"The time is not far off when people of the north can breathe freedom again, we should pay the gratitude of the whole nation to those heroic soldiers who achieved that victory,\" Rajapaksa said. The President further appealed for the release of civilians in Vanni.\nThe downfall and liberation of Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam' mini-state, de facto and administrative capital Killinochchi is a fatal blow to the rebels' 25-year struggle to create an independent state for the Tamils, an ethnic group native to Tamil Nadu, a state in India, and the north-eastern region of Sri Lanka. They predominantly speak Tamil, with a recorded history going back two millennia.\nIn November 2008, the Sri Lankan Army launched an attack on Kilinochchi from three directions. LTTE leader Velupillai Prabhakaran said he promised to defend his stronghold by reverting to guerrilla-style, hit-and-run attacks. \"No sane voice is being raised either to abandon war or to seek a peaceful resolution to the conflict,\" Prabhakaran said.\nThe Battle of Kilinochchi lasted between November 2008 and January 2009 as part of the SLA Northern offensive when the Sri Lanka Army assaulted the Tamil Tiger capital and stronghold. The military announced on Friday it had gained control of the town as the rebels moved towards Mullaitivu, a small town on the north-eastern coast of Sri Lanka, and the capital of the district with the same name in the Northern Province of Sri Lanka. The rebels struggled since 1983 to establish an independent nation for the Tamils. The conflict resulted in more than 70,000 deaths.\nMeanwhile, a suspected suicide attack near the Sri Lanka Air Force headquarters in Colombo killed two airmen and a member of the bomb-disposal unit, and wounded 37 others, three of them critically, just an hour after the President delivered his speech. According to air force spokesman Wing Commander Janaka Nanayakkara, the 37 injured were 16 airmen. \nSri Lankan Army's air force jets and Mi-24 helicopter gunships bombed rebel targets near Oddusuddan and Mullaitivu towns Saturday, when the military closed into the rebels' military headquarters. Government soldiers troops also advanced further to recapture the Elephant Pass which was seized by the Tamil Tigers in April 2000, killing hundreds of soldiers. The strategic Pass, at the Northern Province is located at the entrance to the Jaffna Peninsula which military wrested from rebel dominion in 1995. The rebels however claimed that \"the Sri Lanka army has entered a virtual ghost town as the whole civilian infrastructure as well as the centre of the LTTE had shifted further northeast.\" Troops of the 59 Division attacked the LTTE's coastal garrison, south of Mullaittivu, where the battle had already begun. The siege reportedly killed over two dozen Tamil rebels. \nUsing the strategic crossroads of Paranthan Junction, the Sri Lankan Army's forces advanced Sunday in hot pursuit to capture the Tamil Tigers' last strongholds. It launched both ground and air assault on Elephant Pass to the north and Mullaittivu to the east. \"Day by day, the Tigers' territory is shrinking and their numbers are dwindling. The objective of finishing this war won't be that long off,\" said Maj. Gen. Jagath Dias.\nTamil National Alliance (TNA) parliamentarian Chandrakanthan Chandraneru of Tamil United Liberation Front, called on the Sri Lankan government to bring in a political solution, since the war will continue despite the capture, unless the ethnic crisis is solved. \u201cEverybody is now saying that the east is currently an open prison where people can neither walk nor talk freely. Same thing will happen to Tamil people in the north,\u201d he added.\nMano Ganesan, MP, leader of the Western People's Front (former WPPF) declared that \"political solution to the national ethnic question after the total military victory is not acceptable to the Tamil people. This contention would not convince the international community too. This is the hard truth.\" \nState Department spokesman Gordon Duguid asked the Sri Lankan government to respond to the Tamil concerns. The Tamil Tigers had been \"one of the most notorious and brutal terrorist organizations over the past 20 years,\" and \"a peaceful dialogue is what is called for to resolve the differences and legitimate concerns of the Tamils,\" he said."}

The firm filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the United States, as well as the Dutch equivalent. They had failed to meet a January 4 deadline on postponed debt payments, and talks with creditors failed.\nHeadquartered in The Netherlands, LyondellBasell is owned by private equity tycoon Len Blavatnik, who had already refused the company a loan to help deal with debt resulting from a $12.7 billion merger between Basell International Holdings and Lyondell Chemical to create LyondellBasell Industries.\nThe company had already appointed Kevin McShea from Alix Partners to restructure the firm. McShea was assigned speculatively prior to the bankruptcy filing. Access Industries, Blavatnik's company, refused to extend credit as part of a loan deal brokered in March, a decision Lyondell Chemicals Company, a subsidiary of LyondellBasell, stated they were unhappy with.\nLyondellBasell had postponed $280 million worth of interest payments, which Standard &amp; Poor said placed it in \"selective default\" with a \"rapidly weakening liquidity position\". S&amp;P also said that LyondellBasell have debts of $26 billion in a report on the company prior to the firm's collapse. \nLyondellBasell responded with a press release, issuing the following statement: \"Standard &amp; Poor's definition of 'selected default' related to our corporate credit rating should not be misinterpreted to suggest that LyondellBasell is currently in default of its bank agreements. As they stated in their press release, 'This is a default in our opinion according to our definitions and criteria.' LyondellBasell is not currently in default according to its agreements with its lenders.\"\nThe company met with high oil prices shortly after the expensive merger. This was followed by a general tail-off in demand caused by the ongoing financial crisis. Investors were continuing to bet before the collapse that the firm would restructure under bankruptcy protection, leaving lenders with big losses, potentially over 90% of their investments. The cost of credit protection for LyondellBasell bonds had soared. The creditors include Merrill Lynch, Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, ABN Amro and UBS.\nOn Thursday, an interim allowance was made by a judge for LyondellBasell to seek up to $2.167 billion of loans. There is also an emergency loan paid out of $100 million. As well as LyondellBasell, 79 affiliates have become insolvent. Citigroup has said the collapse will set them back $1.4 billion in unpaid debts.\nSources.\n "}

The country has been severely criticized for web censorship. In a 2008 report, the U.S. State Department stated that \"China had increased its efforts to control and censor the Internet, and the government had tightened restrictions on freedom of speech and the domestic press and bloggers.\" \nIn 1996 Chinese Internet users were required to \"sign a set of rules that makes it illegal for users to produce or receive pornography.\" In 2007 the public security ministry declared it would curb porn, online strip shows, including even erotic stories. Tianya Club, one of the most popular Chinese Internet forums, where members post government attacks, had also been publicly criticized.\nIn December, a woman was arrested and jailed in Shanghai for uploading home-made videos, allegedly showing her performing sex acts. In 2008, Hong Kong actor Edison Chen's and his female partner's obscene pictures circulated in the Chinese internet. Nearly a dozen people were arrested and detained by the authorities for distributing the porn materials. On Monday, these and photos of actress Zhang Ziyi sunbathing topless on a beach still appeared online.\nIn September 2008, Chinese Prime Minister Wen Jiabao said, \"to uphold state security, China, like many countries in the world, has also imposed some proper restrictions. That is for the safety, that is for the overall safety of the country and for the freedom of the majority of the people.\" To control public opinion, Chinese authorities had used a sophisticated spin machine dubbed as \"50-cent party.\" Tens of thousands of \"internet commentators\" were hired and paid 50 Chinese cents ($0.07; \u00a30.05) for each positive posting on websites and forums that upload bad news.\nInternet censorship in the People's Republic of China is conducted under a wide variety of laws and administrative regulations. In accordance with these laws, more than sixty Internet regulations have been made by the People's Republic of China (PRC) government, and censorship systems are vigorously implemented by provincial branches of state-owned ISPs, business companies, and organizations. The escalation of the government's effort to neutralize critical online opinion comes after a series of large anti-Japanese, anti-pollution and anti-corruption protests, many of which were organized or publicized using instant messaging services, chat rooms, and text messages. The size of the Internet police is estimated at more than 30,000.\nInternet Service Providers Association of Ireland (ISPAI), general manager Paul Durant, said that \u201ceach country decides how far it brings up the bar in terms of illegal content. If we are notified of material suspected of being illegal, we can trace it and establish whether it is or not, and then action can be taken if necessary. We are not a censor. If content is found to be illegal, we work with the relevant ISP and the law enforcement agencies throughout Europe to have it taken down. It can lead to huge collateral damage \u2014 you could block one site, for example, which is providing co-location hosting where people have lots of sites under one IP address. This means innocent sites risk being taken out.\u201d\nThe authorities centered on pornography but the major government agenda is to control freedom of expression and to remove destabilizing online portal contents, which attack the Communist Party, suggest democracy or advocate Taiwan independence. In December, over 300 lawyers, writers, scholars and artists jointly signed \"Charter 08\" online petition, which advocates human rights protection by formulation of a new constitution. \nMeanwhile, Center for Democracy and Technology's President and Chief Executive Officer, Leslie Harris, said: \"Look at the words the Chinese government is using: 'low-class,' 'crude.'

Many schools in the United Kingdom were closed because of problems with their heating systems, while heating repair services in Britain received a record number of calls this week.\nIn Paris, accumulating snow and slippery ice resulted in French officials closing pedestrian access to the Eiffel Tower, one of the city's prime tourist locations.\n\"We can't put down salt because it's metallic, we can't use sand either because it risks getting into the elevator,\" stated a press official from the Eiffel Tower.

Polish government officials have reported that 10 people have frozen to death following overnight temperatures of -25\u00b0C as recorded throughout the country. Police in Germany reported that a 77-year-old mentally-ill woman also froze to death after she was reported missing from a nursing home in Weimar.

Mr. Abbas expressed support for the invitation. Israel is yet to respond.\nIsrael's envoy to the United Nations, Gabriela Shalev, made no mention of the proposal by Mr. Mubarak in her speech to the Security Council. She stated, however, that the incursion had dealt heavy blows to the infrastructure of Hamas. She reiterated that Israel had no choice in the face of such attacks but to act.\n\"In the face of such terrorism we have no choice,\" Ms. Shalev said. \"We have to defend ourselves - not from the Palestinian people, but from the terrorists who have taken them hostage.\"\nWhile denying that there is a crisis in the Gaza Strip, the office of Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert will open what it calls a \"humanitarian corridor\" into the territory.\n\"This involves opening up geographical areas for limited periods of time during which the population will be able to receive the aid and stock up,\" the office said."}

EGM was one issue away from its 20th anniversary in February 2009. An internal email leaked to industry website Gamasutra on Tuesday revealed that EGM was to be closed following the acquisition of the online element of the 1UP network by competitor Hearst Corporation's UGO Entertainment and that the January 2009 issue (with Wolverine on the cover) would be the final printed issue of the iconic magazine. Ziff Davis's sale, brokered by GCA Savvian Advisors also includes Mycheats.com, Gametab.com, and GameVideos.com. Hearst Interactive is the owner and operator of UGO Entertainment. \nAccording to CEO Jason Young, the court proceedings help Ziff Davis \u201cpay down debt and shift our full focus to our core PCMag Digital Network Business.\u201d Davis had been focusing on PCMag Digital Network. As a result, around 30 employees of Ziff Davis' Game Group, including EGM Magazine's staff, 1UP Network's web staff, podcast and video producers lost their jobs. A UGO spokesman explained that \"the reality is that UGO Entertainment is saving over 25 jobs, the company is retaining a core group of editorial all-star performers.\" Ziff Davis Holdings Inc (ZFDH.PK), which publishes EGM and about 15 Web sites, obtained Manhattan, New York Court Judge Burton Lifland's approval of a reorganization plan under Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code. It was able, therefore, to emerge from its duly filed March bankruptcy protection petition.\nUGO Entertainment CEO J Moses left a note on EGM's gaming legacy, saying, \"since we started UGO 11 years ago, we have served the gamer community and built a world-class online publishing platform.\" Ziff Davis Media CEO Jason Young further noted: \"We believe this is a smart transaction for Ziff Davis Media that places these market leading assets and teams in a great environment poised for further success. The transaction allows us to pay down debt and shift our full focus to our core PCMag Digital Network business. We thank our 1UP team members for their contributions and wish them the best of success into the future.\" In July 2007, Hearst acquired the 11-year-old UGO Networks (Hearst Interactive) for an estimated price of $100 million. Established in 1998 by CEO J Moses, UGO is an online site targeting men aged 18 to 34. \nJ Moses stated categorically that his company just saved 1UP and UGO never tried to acquire EGM. \u201cClosing EGM has absolutely nothing to do with UGO. We have just hired 24 people and have expanded UGO by 33 percent, because our business is robust and growing. We only wanted to buy 1UP and related sites. That was our interest as a dot-com company and that\u2019s all we\u2019ve ever been for 11 years.\" Sam Kennedy, editorial director of 1UP, further explained that Ziff Davis was insolvent and 1UP was not financially healthy. \"The reality of the market was that no company, including UGO, was willing to sustain 1UP as it was so the cuts were very painful but necessary to the survival of 1UP,\" he added.\nElectronic Gaming Monthly, which has been synonymous to video games for generations of gamers, was an American consumer video game magazine mainstay. It was published by Ziff Davis as part of the 1UP Network and released 12 issues a year (and an occasional extra \"13th\" issue for the Christmas season, also known as the \"Smarch\" issue, a reference to an episode of The Simpsons). As ZD's sole print magazine, EGM, a stalwart of the videogame industry and dubbed the New York Times of games journalism, has been losing money. The 20-year-old publication had 236 issues total, since its debut in 1989. \nIn 2008, the company closed 27-year Games for Windows Magazine, or Computer Gaming World. In late 2006, Ziff-Davis also shuttered its Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine, while its Xbox-focused XBN and Electronics Boutique in-store mag GMR were terminated in 2004. EGM's February issue, which is completed, will only be available digitally. Print publications have been suffering for years now, due to the global economic meltdown."}

Unlike more-deadly strains of Ebola virus, Philippine health officials say this particular strain, known as the , has never caused human illness or death, and it's not immediately clear there is a public-health issue.\nA 22-member team of experts from three United Nations agencies arrived in Manila on Tuesday for a joint risk assessment on the virus contamination of local swine, to help the government contain the outbreak. The mission will coordinate with the Philippine counterparts - the Departments of Agriculture and Health. According to chief veterinary officer, Davinio P. Catbagan, six of 28 swine samples tested positive for Ebola-Reston by the laboratory. The infected pigs came from two commercial and two backyard farms in three provinces north of Manila. Both Ebola and related Marburg hemorrhagic fever, are considered to infect humans via primates.\nThe Straits Times reported that as of December, about 6,000 pigs at Pandi, Bulacan and farms had tested positive for the Ebola-Reston virus. \"Eating pork remained safe as long as it is handled and cooked properly (at a minimum of 70 degrees Celsius or 158 degrees Fahrenheit) and bought in outlets accredited by the government's National Meat Inspection Service,\" said a joint statement by the World Health Organisation (WHO), (OIE) and (FAO). \"Our teams are doing field and laboratory investigation to determine where the Ebola-Reston virus came from and how it was transmitted,\" Caroline-Anne Coulombe, WHO risk communications officer, explained.\nAccording to FAO team leader, Juan Lubroth, it was the first time that the Ebola-Reston virus strain had infected animals other than monkeys and the first recorded worldwide in . The U.N. mission is scheduled to perform 10 days scientific tests, on two hog farms in , and , , but it would take months to publish evaluation reports on the virus. \nAs early as May, a high incidence of swine sickness and death in three provinces caused Philippine authorities in August to send samples from the dead pigs to the NY . The results found the presence of several diseases, including Ebola Reston virus and PRRS.\nIn late October laboratory tests confirmed that pigs in and Bulacan farms were infected with the Ebola-Reston virus and the highly virulent strain of (PRRS). In early 2007 pigs on those farms died at a faster rate than usual amid the conducted lab tests. PRRSV, or Blue-Ear Pig Disease (\"zh\u016b l\u00e1n\u011br b\u00ecng\" \u8c6c\u85cd\u8033\u75c5), is a viral and economically important pandemic disease which causes reproductive failure in breeding stock and respiratory tract illness in young pigs. Initially referred to as 'mystery swine disease' or 'mystery reproductive syndrome', it was first reported in 1987 in North America and Central Europe. The disease costs the United States swine industry around $600 million annually.\nIn December, the Philippine health authorities conducted testing of about 10,000 swine in two northern Luzon quarantined farms. Reuters reported that \"the Ebola-Reston virus in some pigs in two commercial farms and two backyard farms in the Philippines were discovered by accident in United States laboratory tests in September, when samples were sent to test another disease.\"\nEbola virus is one of at least 18 known viruses capable of causing the viral hemorrhagic fever syndrome. It is the common term for a group of viruses belonging to genus Ebolavirus, family Filoviridae, and for the disease which they cause, Ebola hemorrhagic fever. The virus is named after the where the first recognized outbreak of Ebola hemorrhagic fever occurred in 1976. The viruses are characterized by long filaments and have a similar shape to the Marburg virus, also in the family Filoviridae, and share similar disease symptoms. Since its discovery, Ebolavirus has been responsible for a number of deaths.\nIn the central Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), the highly contagious Ebola virus was first detected in September, according to . \"As of Tuesday January 7, a total of 42 patients have been reported with suspected Ebola haemorrhagic fever in the province of Western Kasai... 13 of these 42 patients suspected of having Ebola have died,\" it said.\nThe is suspected of being either another subtype of the Ebola or a new filovirus of Asian origin. It was first discovered in originating in the Philippines, from (now Covance) in 1989. This discovery attracted significant media attention and led to the publication of . There was then, an outbreak of among monkeys imported from the Philippines to , Virginia. The Ebola-Reston strain was discovered among Philippine monkeys in the U.S. again in 1990 and 1996, and in Italy in 1992.\nAccording to the World Health Organization, African strains kill 50 percent to 90 percent of those infected through lethal bleeding and organ failure. \u201cSince the 1970s, scientists, veterinarians, microbiologists and physicians have been looking at thousands of species to see if they can find this elusive reservoir, and we have been pretty much empty-handed,\u201d Juan Lubroth, head of infectious diseases in the animal health unit of the Food and Agriculture Organization in Rome, explained. \nDespite its status as a organism, the Reston ebolavirus is non-pathogenic to humans and is only mildly fatal to monkeys; the perception of its lethality was skewed due to the monkey's coinfection with (SHFV). During the incident in which it was discovered, six animal handlers eventually became seroconverted, one of whom had cut himself while performing a necropsy on the liver of an infected monkey. When the handler failed to become ill, it was concluded that the virus had a very low pathogenicity to humans.\nIn January 1997, The Philippines Department of Environment and Natural Resources had ordered the immediate slaughter of some 600 monkeys in Ferlite, a breeding farm in , to prevent an outbreak of the deadly Ebola Reston strain virus.\nThe US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had donated 8,000 test kits to diagnose the ebola reston strain. \"I am more concerned in the international community because we have proven in our December sales that this ebola did not affect consumer confidence,\" Albert R. T. Lim, president of the National Federation of Hog Farmers, Inc., warned. The Philippines Department of Agriculture (DA) has directed the Bureau of Animal Industry (BAI) and the National Meat Inspection Commission (NMIC) to conduct swine tests in using the US test kits for the Ebola Reston virus, before approval of the \"Meat in a Box\" shipment to Singapore. The initial export of the meat for December was deferred pending outcome of the ERV tests.\nMeanwhile, in eight of , in Mindanao, at least 50 pigs died since December due to viral and bacterial infections. Dr. Nestor Barroga, provincial veterinarian, said that he could not however detect yet the type of the infecting virus. The village of Pong-pong had the largest number of casualties. Mercy Olalo, a hog raiser, said their pigs would suddenly become weak and eventually die. \"The pigs developed red skins and they salivate excessively,\" she said."}

Florida, ranked Number 1 in the nation, were led by Heisman Trophy-winning quarterback Tim Tebow. \"I promised the guys that I would go out and play with all my heart. I was so motivated tonight,\" said Tebow. They were matched up against a Number 2 ranked Oklahoma team with a powerful offense, including this year's Heisman Trophy winner, quarterback Sam Bradford. The game took place at a sold-out Dolphin Stadium in Miami, as a stadium record 78,468 fans attended the match.\nBoth team's defensed dominated each others' offenses in the first half, forcing a 7 to 7 score when halftime came against a Florida offense that averaged 54 points a game and an Oklahoma offense that averaged 40 points. In total, both team's defenses had 4 interceptions, 2 for Florida and 2 for Oklahoma. Florida's defense stopped Oklahoma twice during a goal line stand, stopping them on a fourth-down rush once, and a forced interception out of the hands of Oklahoma wide receiver Juaquin Iglesias by Florida's Ahmad Black.\nOn the offensive side of the ball, Florida was led by Tebow. Although throwing 2 interceptions, Tebow completed 18 put of 30 passes for 2 touchdowns, as well as rushed 22 times for over 100 yards. Oklahoma quarterback Sam Bradford helped the Sooners offense through the air, completing 26 out of 41 passes for 256 yards and 2 passing touchdowns, but also throwing two interceptions. In the fourth quarter, Tebow completed a key 4-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver David Nelson, making the score 24 to 14 and putting the game out of reach for Oklahoma.\nSome college fans believe that Florida did not rightly win the national championship, though. Fans of the Utah Utes believed that their undefeated team should have at least earned a spot in the game against Oklahoma or Florida's one-loss teams. Fans of the USC Trojans and the Texas Longhorns also believed that the teams could have earned a spot in the game, due to their similar records. On the matter, Florida head coach Urban Meyer said \"This is one of the best teams in college football history. Let someone else worry about all that. The Gators are No.1.\" \nOn the game, Oklahoma head coach Bob Stoops commented \"In the end, I'll be glad to try again next year. If that's the biggest burden I have to bear in my life, I'm a pretty lucky guy.\" Tim Tebow, in a post-game interview, said \"I was already motivated for a national championship game. But you know, there was some trash talking going on, and it just gets me going during the game.\" In a losing effort, Sam Bradford commented \"In the first half, we had opportunities that we didn't take advantage of. In the second half, when we needed to make the plays, we just couldn't do it.\"\n "}

Ottawa ultra-runner Ray Zahab, age 39, adventure journalist and architect Kevin Vallely, age 44, of Lynn Valley, North Vancouver and North Pole expeditionist Richard Weber, age 49, said they completed the 700-mile (1,130-kilometer) journey, at 10,000 feet altitude, finally arriving early Wednesday morning.\nThey endured a white-out but survived on a 7,000-calorie-a-day diet of pemmican, Gatorade drink powder, outdated salami, deep-fried bacon, cheese and butter. \"If you took a cloud, wrapped it around your head and then duct-taped it, that's what a white-out is like,\" Mr Zahab, explained. The trio also suffered altitude sickness, vertigo, massive, painful blisters, and temperatures as low as minus 40. Zahab had to pull 170-lb (77-kg) sleds of equipment, traveling on foot and on snowshoes while the other two men skied. \nAccording to ExplorersWeb.com's founder, Tom Sjogren, the trio erased the previous record of 39 days, 7 hours and 49 minutes, which was set by American Todd Carmichael, the first American to cross Antarctica to the South Pole alone, on foot and with no assistance. He arrived at The Pole on December 21, 2008. \"They have definitely broken the record,\" said Sjogren. Guinness World Records spokesman, Damian Field, in London, however, said that \"Guinness monitors a category for fastest unsupported trek to the South Pole, but it has no record currently listed.\" \nPrior to Carmichael, the record was held by Briton Hannah McKeand. In the fastest journey to the South Pole (600 nautical mile journey), she completed solo and in just 39 days, 9 hours and 33 minutes. In March 2008 she attempted to reach the North Pole alone and unsupported but had to abandon the trip after falling through the ice and badly damaging her shoulder.\nRay Zahab is a Canadian ultramarathon runner, personal trainer, and motivational speaker. He lives in Chelsea, Quebec, and is famous for his 4,300-mile (6,920-kilometer) epic run across the Sahara Desert in 2007, which was the subject of a documentary narrated by actor Matt Damon's \"Running the Sahara.\" He heads Impossible2Possible, a nonprofit organization which advocates planet protection. \"I started looking at impossible places on the planet in the past year, and I said Antarctica is one of those impossible places, and if we can create an expedition, perhaps we can inspire a bunch of young people to realize they can achieve,' Zahab said.\nRichard Weber, M.S.M. (born June 9, 1959 in Edmonton, Alberta) is a world-renowned Canadian Arctic and polar adventurer, from Alcove (near Wakefield). From 1978 to 2006, he participated in, lead and organized more than 45 Arctic expeditions. Richard is the only person to have completed six full North Pole expeditions. He has therefore trekked to the North Pole more than anyone in history.\nThe trio were waiting out a storm before boarding a flight to Chile for Ottawa. \"I'm pretty tired, actually,\" said Kevin Vallely, calling from Patriot Hills, Antarctica. During the saga, Vallely was solely burdened with carrying the high-tech gear in his sled consisting of video cameras, satellite phones, hand-held computers, different kinds of solar panels, batteries and wires chargers. \"Had we not brought all that stuff we probably would have got it done faster because we wouldn't have had to carry all that weight, but then it doesn't matter as much,\" he explained. Vallely said he also intends to produce a documentary of the expedition. "}

However, the \"Faina\"'s owner has expressed doubts about the veracity of this report, which originated with the pirates themselves.\nThe remaining crew are reported to be healthy by the Ukrainian Presidency and the ship is now heading to Mombasa under US Navy escort. There are 17 Ukrainians, two Russians and a Latvian on board."}

Rama Raju, the company's managing director, were arrested late Friday by Andhra Pradesh police. The brothers were placed under judicial custody in a Hyderabad, India jail and will remain there until January 23. Facing charges of criminal breach of trust (Section 406 of IPC), criminal conspiracy (Section 120-B), cheating (Section 420), falsification of records and forgery (Section 468), and fraudulent cancellation of securities (Section 477-a), they face up to ten years imprisonment if convicted.\nAfter 18 hours of interrogation by the Crime Investigation Department (CID) at the state police headquarters, the Raju brothers were sent to the Chanchalguda prison and slept Saturday night on the floor along with 26 other low-risk inmates.\nS. Bharat Kumar, the Rajus's lawyer, asked the magistrate to issue orders for health monitoring. \"His blood pressure is fluctuating and he needs medical treatment,\" said Bharat Kumar. Mr. Raju appeared before the court Saturday while a team of doctors visited him after he had complained of chest pain.\nRaju has Hepatitis-C, and both brothers have high blood pressure, so health precautions are necessary while imprisoned. Prison rules mandate service of jail food thrice a day. The menu includes 650 gm of rice thrice a day with 250 gm of vegetable curry and 125 gm of 'daal' plus tea twice a day.\nSatyam's chief financial officer Vadlamani Srinivas, who was also arrested Saturday, had undergone preliminary investigation and appeared Sunday before a special court, according to A. Sivanarayana, Andhra Pradesh additional director general of police. Srinivas was remanded to judicial custody until January 23 by Mr. D. Ramakrishna, Sixth Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, and sent to the Chanchalguda jail with the Raju brothers after interrogation by CID's Crime Branch (the CB-CID). During his Saturday night arrest and probe by CB-CID, Srinivas made revelations which are contained in his confession letter as submitted to Network 18. \"According to me fixed deposits are unreal and fictitious which were managed and was an understanding between the audit section management,\" Srinivas stated.\nThe Hyderabad court on Monday postponed the bail hearings of the Raju brothers and Srinivas to January 16. To be defended by a battalion of 25 lawyers, the three accused will remain in Chanchalguda Central Jail until further court order. The Raju brothers were shifted Sunday to a mid-size Old Hospital Barrack cell shared with a bootlegger.\nThe offences.\nIn 2008, the company struggled to purchase two infrastructure companies founded by family members of company founder and CEO Dr. Raju - Maytas Infrastructure and Maytas Properties - for $1.6 billion, despite concerns raised by independent board directors. Dr. Raju tendered his resignation on January 7 after due notice of falsified accounts to board members and the SEBI.\nSince January 7 when two lawsuits were commenced, dozens of other class action law suits were filed against Satyam for hundreds of millions of dollars damages based on fraud in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York in Manhattan, among others. The securities fraud class-action lawsuits have been filed on behalf of investors who bought Satyam American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) since 2004.\nOn Wednesday Dr. Raju admitted to falsifying and overstating Satyam's cash reserves by $1B US dollars (\u00a3661m) or 94% of its cash and bank balances on books at the end of September.\nThe fraud was perpetrated several years ago to bridge \"a marginal gap\" between actual and accounting books operating profits, and continued for several years. \"It was like riding a tiger, not knowing how to get off without being eaten,\" B. Raju said. \nIn a letter to the board, Dr. Raju said that neither he nor the managing director had benefited financially from the inflated revenues. Further claiming that none of the board members had any knowledge of the dire company situation, he noted that Satyam's balance sheet as of the September 30, 2008, carried inflated figures for cash and bank balances of INR 5,040 crore (as against INR 5,361 crore reflected in the books). He alleged it also carried an accrued interest of INR 376 crore which was non-existent. He confessed that he himself prepared an understated liability of INR 1,230 crore on account of funds amid an overstated debtors' position of INR 490 crore (as against INR 2,651 crore in the books).\nIndian analysts have compared the Satyam-Raju scandal to the infamous American Enron scandal. Immediately following the media expose, PricewaterhouseCoopers, auditor of Satyam's accounts, was set to be probed for complicity in the controversy. \"Times Now\" has reported that the Andhra Pradesh CID arrested PricewaterhouseCoopers (PWC) representative Gopal Krishnan for investigation on Saturday night.\nAbout Satyam Computer Services.\nNew York-listed Satyam Computer Services Ltd., India's fourth-biggest software firm, is a consulting and information technology services company based in Hyderabad, India. Founded in 1987 by Dr. Byrraju Ramalinga Raju, Satyam's network spans 67 countries on six continents. It employs 53,000 professionals in India, the United States, the United Kingdom, the United Arab Emirates, Canada, Hungary, Singapore, Malaysia, China, Japan, Egypt and Australia. Its monthly salary outflow is estimated at six billion rupees ($125 million). Deriving more than half of its revenues from the United States, it serves 700 global companies, 185 of which are Fortune 500 corporations.\nSatyam's clients include Nestle, Ford, General Electric Co., General Motors Corp., Nissan Motor Co., Applied Materials Inc., Caterpillar Inc., Cisco Systems Inc. and Sony Corp., and brought in about $40bn last year.\nImpact on Satyam Computer Services finances and reactions.\nIn December 2008, a failed acquisition attempt involving the company Maytas led to a plunge in Satyam's share price. After Wednesday's confession, Satyam stocks fell further by more than 70%, while the BSE SENSEX dropped to 7.3% Wednesday, causing the removal of Satyam Computer Services from its indices on Thursday. The shares free fell to 11.50 rupees on Friday, their lowest level since March 1998, compared with around last year's high of 544 rupees.\nThe New York Stock Exchange has terminated trading in Satyam stock as of January 7, while the National Stock Exchange of India said it will remove Satyam from its S&amp;P CNX Nifty 50-share index from January 12.\nIndia's biggest-ever corporate fraud has seriously tainted India Inc.'s strong corporate governance image. \"The admission of fraud in financial affairs has created an adverse impression in the minds of trade, business and industry across the world,\" the Indian government admitted. The government intervened on Friday night, dismissing Satyam's board of directors, announcing it will appoint representatives to manage the affairs of the insolvent outsourcing giant. The board would meet within seven days. Dr Yeduguri Samuel Rajasekhara Reddy, chief Minister of State of Andhra Pradesh, India, on Sunday said that the main agenda is to protect the jobs of the software professionals. \"We are taking all needful steps in coordination with the government of India to ensure that the jobs of 53,000 engineers are protected and the shareholders\u2019 money is salvaged,\" Reddy said.\n\"We are working on the names. The Satyam case is an aberration. The credibility of the Indian corporate sector in general, and IT sector in particular, should not be allowed to suffer because of this.\" Prem Chand Gupta, the Corporate Affairs Minister said. The Federal Government of India appointed a three-member independent board with full authority for Satyam on Sunday and was set to convene within 24 hours. \"We have appointed Deepak Parekh, chairman of Housing Development Finance Corporation, Kiran Karnik, former president of IT industry body NASSCOM and C. Achutan, former member of Securities and Exchange Board (SEBI) of India,\" Mr. Gupta said. \nIn early Monday trading (0535 GMT) after the creation of the three-member board, Satyam shares rocketed upwards 60% to 38.15 rupees, even though the main Mumbai market was down more than 2%. BBC reported that Satyam shares have jumped 51% to 36.05 rupees on Monday after the stock lost 87% last week. \"The constitution of the new board is seen as a positive step by the market. It's a confidence boosting measure,\" K.K. Mital, Globe Capital, New Delhi head of portfolio management services said. \"But the rally will depend largely on the financial situation at the company and the kind of measures that are taken to improve liquidity,\" he added.\nThe Company Law Board, however, has requested Satyam's interim board not to implement its decisions. \n\"We are asked by the Company Law Board not to implement the decisions of the board. But we are allowed to continue our activity. The team which was constituted recently is continuing its work,\" Satyam head global marketing and communications, Mr. Hari Thalapalli, said.\nLazard Ltd., who has a 7.4% stake in Satyam, sought representation on the new board and wrote as much to The Indian Ministry of Corporate Affairs. \"As the largest shareholder in the company, we want to be consulted in whatever decisions are being taken by the Indian government. We have written to the Ministry of Corporate Affairs and are awaiting a reply from them,\" Hitesh Jain, a partner at ALMT Legal, who claimed to represent Lazard, said. \"It is a fair proposal and we will take a decision as and when we clear other issues. No decision on this has been taken yet,\" P.C. Gupta replied.\nMeanwhile, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) also announced it will try to control the damage and take steps to boost investor confidence. \"This exercise will be undertaken after the third quarter results and is expected to be completed by end of February this year,\" a SEBI official statement said. A SEBI team is also investigating acting-CEO Ram Mynampati whose salary was greater than that of founder Dr. Raju and all the directors combined. Dr. Raju had just one fifth of Mynampati's total package of over Rs 3.5 crore as of March 2008. All the directors comparably received only a total of Rs 2.6 crore as salary, commissions, sitting fees, professional fees and other receivables. \nFurther, the Andhra Pradesh Police CID and teams assigned by the Economic Offences Wing of the CB-CID conducted searches Sunday of homes of the accused including the ex-CFO's office to gather documentary evidence about the financial fraud."}

The arrests are the latest related to an alleged clandestine neonationalist organization referred to as \"Ergenekon\". The Ergenekon case has had adverse effects on financial markets in Turkey, a candidate for the European Union.\nTurkey's state-run news service, Anatolian News, reported that the four Turkish army officers were arrested in Istanbul for alleged ties to a right-wing group suspected of conspiring to overthrow the AK Party government. 40 people were detained on Wednesday, including three retired army generals. \nPrime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan and General Ilker Basbug, Chief of the General Staff of the Turkish Armed Forces, held crisis talks on Thursday to discuss the recent waves of arrests. General Basbug met with the prime minister after a six-hour meeting with military commanders, including members of the Gendarmerie, Turkish Air Force, and Army. After his meeting with the prime minister, General Basbug met with President Abdullah Gul. President Abdullah Gul met with Besir Atalay, Turkey's interior minister.\nThe talks between Erdogan and Basbug prompted a spate of selling on the Istanbul Stock Exchange, which fell by six percent on Thursday. TUSIAD, the main business association in Turkey, voiced its hope that investigators respect the legal rights of the suspects.\nTurkish media also reported Saturday that law enforcement officials found ammunition and grenades buried near Golbasi lake outside Ankara, supposedly related to the Ergenekon organization. According to the Turkish media reports, police found a drawing in the home of former police chief Ibrahim Sahin, which led them to the site. Ibrahim Sahin was among the 40 individuals arrested Wednesday.\nDeniz Baykal, who heads Turkey's secular chief opposition party the Republican People's Party, was critical of the arrests made by police under the AK Party government. \"We are witnessing a confrontation against the Republic's core values. This is a regime change, like in the Khomeini and Hitler eras,\" said Baykal at a news conference held Wednesday. According to Baykal, the Ergenekon investigation is an attempt by the government to silence opposition. Other members of the opposition have also criticized the investigation as being politically motivated.\nIn a statement published in the Turkish newspaper \"H\u00fcrriyet\", Justice Minister Mehmet Ali \u015eahin asserted that the Ergenekon investigation is judicial and appropriate. \"The investigation has no political aspects. Detentions are purely juridical. I follow developments from the press,\" said \u015eahin.\n\"Wikinews\" interviewed a college graduate and resident of Turkey who wished not to be named, and this individual shared thoughts on the effects of the Ergenekon investigation on local citizens. \"It affected everyone in the country. Everyone wonders if they are next,\" said the source. \"I am terrified here - anytime the wind is not in favor of the ruling party a new wave of this crap happens.\"\nMembers of the Turkish state bureaucracy, military, and judicial system make up the country's secularist establishment. According to \"Reuters\", this secularist establishment states that the arrests carried out by the AK Party are retaliatory, in response to a 2008 court case. The court case attempted to ban the AK Party, which has roots in political Islam, for anti-secular activities. The AK Party has denied these claims.\n\"The risk of a reaction by the military is growing as the Ergenekon probe is turning into a test of strength between the AKP and secularist circles,\" said analyst Wolfango Piccoli of the Eurasia Group in a statement published in the \"Financial Times\".\nThe investigation by the government began in June 2007, when officials discovered a cache of arms in Istanbul in the home of a retired military officer. According to \"The Guardian\", in total approximately 200 people have been arrested in relation to the investigation. 86 individuals have been indicted since the investigation started, including many officials from the military and two retired four-star generals. In addition to military officials, the investigation has focused on journalists, writers, politicians and leaders of gangs. The murder of journalist Hrant Dink is sometimes cited as possibly linked to the Ergenekon case.\nThe indictments allege involvement in plans to increase instability in the country through political assassinations. \"H\u00fcrriyet\" reported that the Ergenekon investigation has faced criticism in the past for detaining suspects for extended periods of time in prison without charges, and for its reliance on insubstantial evidence. In the past 50 years, the country's military has intervened to topple four governments in Turkey."}

Ferry accidents are common in the island nation of Indonesia, where the fleet is largely old and overcrowded. In July 2005 about 200 died when a ferry capsized off eastern Indonesia.

Mitts, 42, of Spring, Texas. He died about 9 p.m. Wednesday night at Memorial Hermann Hospital, said hospital spokeswoman Ann Brimberry. Mitts was the oldest of five men on board the ill-fated helicopter. He was assigned to Iraq from September 2006 to September 2007 with Company C of the 1st Battalion, 108th Aviation Regiment, based in Topeka, Kansas. Mitts was posthumously promoted from his present rank, Chief Master Sgt. Gonda Moncada announced.\nThe three others on board the UH-60 Black Hawk were injured in the accident. The pilot, Chief Warrant Officer 2 Matthew J. Smith, 41, of Leander, and 1st Lt. Ellis W. Taylor, 31, of Buda, were in stable condition Thursday at Brooke Army Medical Center. Sgt. Richard D. Ravenscraft, 24, of Austin, also was initially listed as critical but upgraded to stable in College Station.\nThe accident is under investigation by the Combat Readiness/Safety Center in Fort Rucker, Alabama, home of the U.S. Army Aviation Center. \"They have a reputation for extreme thoroughness and quickness,\" said Texas Guard Capt. Adam Collett. The probe team will review the wrecked helicopter and debris scattered on Duncan Field next to Duncan Dining Hall, near the Corps of Cadets field on the school's College Station campus, about 100 miles northwest of Houston, Texas. \"Every piece the way it landed is still in place,\" said Texas Army National Guard Chief Master Sgt. Gonda Moncada, adding that investigators began the expert examination of evidence Wednesday morning.\nAs part of a five-ship training exercise, the Blackhawk helicopter was performing a training demonstration for about 190 Corps of Cadets in the ROTC Rudder\u2019s Rangers Annual Winter Field Training Exercises. It was also used to transfer the students to Duncan Field just off George Bush Drive. When the helicopter was attempting to take off, a rudder reportedly malfunctioned. \"At first, it looked like he was hot-dogging and then very quickly it was obvious he was in trouble and not messing around. All of a sudden he dropped straight back down into the ground,\" Scott Walker Walker, publications manager for the A&amp;M Association of Former Students said. \"There was a bunch of people on Duncan Field and everyone went running and diving for cover,\" he added. The aircraft entered a rotational spin upon take off and plummeted down on its tail boom, with its cabin section largely intact.\nThe chopper will be transferred to the Austin Aviation Support Facility, where it is was based. Some parts of the Blackhawk will also be sent to the Corpus Christi Army Depot for testing, Officials with Texas Military Forces officials said.\n\"Our thoughts and prayers go to the crew members involved in this tragedy, and especially to the family and friends of the crew member who reportedly died as a result of injuries sustained in the crash,\" A&amp;M President Elsa Murano stated. \nThe UH-60 Black Hawk is a four-bladed, twin-engine, medium-lift utility helicopter manufactured by Sikorsky Aircraft. It is a utility tactical transport helicopter that replaces the UH-1 \"Huey\" and has been in use since 1979.\nIt was based at the Austin Army Aviation Support Facility at Austin-Bergstrom International Airport. The aircraft's soldiers came from Austin and San Antonio.

Giles Cardozo, age 29, from Dorset, with chief pilot and expedition leader Neil Laughton, age 45, an ex-SAS officer, will fly and drive the amazing two-seater vehicle more than 6,000-km (3,750-miles) to fabled Timbuktu on February 20. \n\"I just can't wait to see their faces when we fly in and start playing football with them. I don't think they will be able to believe somebody in a flying car has just visited them,\" 'extreme golfer' Mr Laughton said before the departure. Timbuktu (Timbuctoo; Koyra Chiini: Tumbutu; French: Tombouctou) is an isolated city in Tombouctou Region, in the West African nation of Mali. They will traverse Europe and Africa about 42 days to arrive at the city in Mali, West Africa before returning home via Senegal. \nThe home-made 450-kilogram Skycar has been designed by Cardozo in just 18 months. It is the world's first road legal bio fuelled flying car. It is a four cylinders modified Rage Motorsport off-road racing buggy which was approved by the government last month. It runs on bioethanol and is powered by a modified 140bhp Yamaha R1 superbike engine with a lightweight automatic continuously variable transmission from a snowmobile.\nThe team invested about \u00a3250,000 ($380,000) to make the 1000cc engine Skycar desert-proof. In its maiden voyage, the flying car will be escorted by up to 13 people convoy including an eight-wheel truck, two Toyota Land Cruiser 4x4s and several motorbikes. It has left London's Sheraton Park Tower hotel, heading through the capital to Dunsfold airfield in Surrey. \nThe team had initially planned to take the air route across the English Channel, but the 35km flight was vetoed by aviation authorities. Skycar is required by law to obtain a license from Britain's Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), including a permit from the British Microlight Aircraft Association (BMAA). Skycar spokeswoman, Charlie Bell, however clarified that the team was \"in liaison with the CAA and they are looking to finalize the permit,\" adding that it is in order for the rest of the trip.\nThe Skycar will thereafter fly over the high-altitude Pyrenees near Andorra, and would cross over the 14-km (nine-mile) Strait of Gibraltar. The prepared journey also includes the route through Mauritania, Atlas Mountains in Morocco and into Mali. It will further cross the harsh environment of Sahara\u2019s remote \u201cRub' al Khali\" (empty quarter), for up to two weeks amid real fears of terrorist attacks.\nThe expedition will not have an easy task, especially since the Skycar will be tested to the limits amid punishing operating environments and weather conditions. \"Clearly the reliability of the car is crucial,\" said Mr Laughton. \"We're going to have to cope with wind chill temperatures as low as -30 deg C and blistering heat of up to 50 deg C. But it's been fully tested at a secret location and it 100 per cent works,\" he added.\nThe Parajet Skycar is a prototype flying car. It was developed by British paramotor manufacturer Parajet. The flying car utilizes a paramotor and a parafoil attached to a modified dune buggy to achieve sustained level flight. Should the engine fail, the vehicle can glide back to the ground. Should the canopy rip, an emergency reserve parachute would be deployed. It requires three minutes to convert it from a car to an aircraft. The prototype runs on biodiesel and is fully road-legal.\nIn 2004 British engineer Giles Cardozo, a paramotor manufacturer, has invented a fan-powered flying car to prove the Skycar is real and works. \u201cI started making a paramotor on wheels that you sit on and take off and it suddenly occurred to me, \u2018Why not just have a car that does everything?\u2019\u201d Cardozo said. His Wiltshire-based company Parajet built the paramotor that the adventurer Bear Grylls did fly near Everest in 2008. In 1998, Grylls, aged 23, became the youngest British to ascend Mount Everest. In May 2007, Grylls and Cardozo departed from Pheriche, about 32 kilometres south of Mount Everest.\nCardozo has claimed he may finally have made it. \u201cI\u2019ve been dreaming about making flying cars since I was a boy, thinking about all the ways it could be done and seeing how all the other people in the world have done it wrong. No one\u2019s ever made one that really does work that you can go out and buy. But here\u2019s the ultimate solution: it\u2019s cheap, it\u2019s safe, it works, all the technology\u2019s already there. So I pushed ahead and thought, \u2018We\u2019ve got to do it\u2019,\u201d he said.\nIf the Skycar becomes successful, Cardozo\u2019s company plans a limited production with a selling price of \u00a335,000 to \u00a340,000 for a standard model and \u00a360,000 for a high-performance sports version. \u201cIt will be a serious aircraft but also a proper road machine, with acceleration to match your average sports car,\u201d says Cardozo. \u201cI\u2019m not going to sell millions of them but even if we sell 20 we\u2019ll be laughing,\u201d he added.\nThe explorers, with the aid of sponsors, supporters and benefactor Sir Ranulph Twisleton-Wykeham-Fiennes, 3rd Baronet OBE (known as 'Ranulph (Ran) Fiennes'), have aimed to raise more than \u00a3100,000 for some charities including an African orphanage.

While all five were dug out by those who had not been buried, Waldner had already succumbed to the conditions, and his body was left by the group, fearing further slides; the body was recovered late Monday by search and rescue crews.

Waldner was one of two deaths last weekend, the other occurring near Enderby. Though 30 snowmobilers quickly responded to a call to assist in digging out 24-year-old Matt Simmons, the man was not wearing a beacon and was not recovered quickly enough to save him.\nOn December 28, eight snowmobilers died in slides near Fernie in BC's southeast.\nThe RCMP are asking the public to take every precaution when in the backcountry. \"Please do not operate snowmobiles in areas where avalanches are likely or may possibly occur,\" a news release urged.\nRCMP spokesman Constable Craig Douglass was critical of those not taking the necessary safety measures. \"I don't know what goes through their minds, but I guess the fun outweighs the risks and they're making the choice to go in these areas.\" He noted that people can still enjoy the outdoors safely, as long as they find \"places they can operate snowmobiles that are going to be safe, that are not in avalanche areas or zones.\"\nIn the 2002-2003 winter season, BC saw 29 people killed in avalanches."}

According to General Motors, the new \"2009 Cadillac Presidential Limousine\" is the first not to carry a specific model name. The Obama Mobile was introduced on January 14 with noticeably different styling borrowed from the Cadillac Escalade and STS, while the suspension is most likely related to the Chevrolet Kodiak medium-duty truck. \nMr. David Caldwell of General Motors has revealed that the sleek black car would include a hand-crafted interior and \"state of the art electronics.\" The car's high-tech security features include five-inch-thick (12.7-centimeter-thick) bombproof glass, tough-as-nails tires, and a sealed interior that's invulnerable to chemical attack. The armoured limousine has been heavily modified to withstand potential attacks by weapons or bombs. The San Francisco Chronicle puts it in a proper perspective noting, \u201ca half-inch of transparent armor is enough to stop a .44 Magnum round at point-blank range; at a thickness of 1 1/4 to 1 1/2 inches, the same material can withstand higher-velocity bullets fired from military assault rifles.\u201d\nAccording to spy photographer, Brenda Priddy, and General Motors, the limousine, which has the intricate, dual-textured grille, is also equipped with standard Goodyear Regional RHS truck tires in a 285/70R19.5 size, on 19.5-inch wheels. The rims have a run-flat device (manufactured by Hutchinson Industries). Xenon headlights from the Escalade are installed in the front, while the rear has some STS part. The doors are at least 20 centimeters (8 inches) thick.

The new limousine is the responsibility of White House Transportation Agency.\nThe Presidential State Car is the official state car used by the President of the United States. It is informally known as \"Cadillac One\". The current Presidential State Car is a 2005 hand-crafted, armored, and stretched DTS (DeVille Touring Sedan) built on a GM four-wheel drive platform. It was first used on the second inauguration parade of George W. Bush in 2005. But the version to be used by President Obama uses a GMC Topkick chassis, while maintaining the Cadillac exterior.\nThe President of the United States travels in one of two armoured Cadillac limousines based upon the normal sedan, the Cadillac DTS, with heavy customisation. Lincoln cars have also been used in the past, most notably by President John F Kennedy. The current limousines were custom-built by O'Gara, Hess and Eisenhart, founded in Fairfield, Ohio in 1942. It specializes in armouring limousines for presidents and heads of state.\nPresident William McKinley was the first US president to ride in an automobile. However, it was President Theodore Roosevelt who rode on the first government-owned car, a white Stanley Steamer. Roosevelt's successor, William Howard Taft, was the first president to use a presidential state car that was permanently stored in the White House garage.\nMeanwhile, Obama's 2005 Chrysler 300C Hemi was auctioned on eBay with a starting bid of $100,000 and a buy-it-now price of $1,000,000.

He has created a new forum topic entitled, \"ok we have 9 days until my Presidential Assasination\"[sic]\".\" He referred to Obama as a 'sacrificial lamb.' \"Yes, I have decided I will assassinate Barack Obama. It's really nothing personal about the man. He speaks well, has a loving although controlling wife and two cute daughters. But I know it's for the country's own good that I can do this. Barack Obama, I view more as a sacrificial lamb, but the sacrifice must take place,\" Christopher wrote on January 11. \nChristopher previously posted possible threats against President George W. Bush, saying, \"let's hope this time they don't hang up on, like last time when I threatened to kill gw and called them to tell.\" Christopher's online posts contained expletives and anti-Semitic views, according to an affidavit filed by Secret Service agent Kelly Adcox. The internet forum posts, however, stated he never owned nor fired a gun before, adding someone would have to deliver him one. Now he has alleged it was all a bluff to get publicity. \nAs it turns out this man calls himself \"Stevie the Playboy\", \"SHR,\" \"Trinity\" and in some cases \"god\". Christopher also spent time on the internet, using at least three different usernames to post about 70 different YouTube videos. The Alien-Earth Web site administrator notified a special agent with the U.S. Secret Service of the posted web messages.\nThe agents traced the Internet protocol address corresponding to a home on California Road in Brookhaven. According to John Dowdy, Chief of Criminal Division for the Office of the U.S. Attorney, and Lincoln County Sheriff Steve Rushing, Christopher had spent several months at Lincoln County's Lena Lock in a female friend's house at 2033 California Road. He had also been shuttling back and forth to 1939 California Road \u2014 the residence of Lock's aunt, Etta Berry.\n\"Once we determined the IP address came back to user Lena Lock in Brookhaven, it kind of focused our investigation down into that area,\" Dowdy said. \"We've been actively pursuing this since the afternoon of the 14th when we were put on notice,\" he added. \"We got the call this (Friday) morning from the Secret Service to help go pick him up,\" Rushing who was accompanied by Secret Service agents Friday at 11:30 a.m. to arrest Christopher said. \"We got him without incident,\" he added. \nDowdy said Christopher is charged with violating Title 18, United States Code, Section 871 \u2014 threatening to kill the President-Elect of the United States \u2014 which carries a maximum penalty of up to five years in prison and a $250,000 fine.\nChristopher appeared Friday afternoon before U.S. Magistrate Judge James C. Sumner of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, located at the John Minor Wisdom U.S. Courthouse in New Orleans, Louisiana. The judge at the hearing asked Christopher if he suffered any mental illness or was prescribed any medication. \"There is nothing wrong with my mind,\" Christopher replied.\nWearing a faded yellow shirt and shorts, Christopher had handcuffs bind his wrists and ankles when he was escorted from the John Minor Wisdom U.S. Courthouse in downtown Jackson on Friday afternoon after the hearing. \"I'm trying to get people's attention, they were only bluffs. I'm trying to get everyone to listen to me because I have an important message from God,\" said Christopher. \"Everyone needs to move to Florida by December 31st, this is the end of the world as we know it,\" he further warned in a video posting. He is being held in the Madison County Jail until a bail hearing Thursday.\nIn court documents published on Friday, it came to light that federal agents discovered Christopher's driver's license internet photos from Illinois, Texas, and Wisconsin. In February 2008, he was indicted in Walworth County, Wisconsin with knowingly violating a domestic abuse order. \nIn August 2008, Obama was subject of another alleged assassination plot at the Democratic National Convention in Denver, Colorado. The three men, Tharin Robert Gartrell, 28, Shawn Robert Adolf, 34, and Nathan Dwayne Johnson, 33, were arrested after Gartrell was stopped by Aurora police near East Hampden Avenue and Parker Road. On December 16, Johnson pleaded guilty to one count of possession of a weapon by a prohibited person. He faces 10 to 37 months in prison when he is sentenced in federal court on March 20, 2009. The others accused are awaiting trial.\nIn October 2008, the ATF, a US federal law enforcement agency, had two young men in the state of Tennessee arrested by the local Crockett County sheriff's department on unspecified charges. Court documents revealed that the men allegedly had discussed committing a school shooting at a predominately African-American school and beheading 14 of them.\nPaul Schlesselman and Daniel Cowart were charged in an alleged plot to assassinate Senator Barack Obama, the 2008 Democratic Party presidential nominee. A grand jury indicted the accused on November 5 on federal charges of threatening to kill and inflict bodily harm upon a major presidential candidate, conspiracy, interstate unlawful transportation of an unregistered firearm, interstate transportation of a firearm with the intent to commit a felony, transporting a short-barrelled shotgun across state lines without a license and unlawful possession of a short-barrelled shotgun. Cowart was also charged with damaging religious property and use of a firearm during a crime of violence."}

This is due to concerns raised about the government's subsidy program for digital TV receiver boxes, which has run out of money with over 1 million televisions in the United States still running on analog. \n\"In Minnesota, more than 21% of our households depend exclusively on over-the-air broadcast TV. While the digital TV transition should happen, this delay is necessary to make up for the lack of preparation on the part of the current administration. Unfortunately, after guarantees that the Bush administration would adequately prepare and protect consumers, only in the last few days have they revealed that funding has run out\u2014 just weeks before the plug is pulled on analog TV.\" said US Senator Amy Klobuchar, from Minnesota. \nSenator Jay Rockefeller, from the state of West Virginia, also led the charge for the bill to be passed. He said in a statement to the media, \"Over 2 million Americans are waiting to receive a coupon to help them offset the cost of equipment that will help them manage the transition. Millions more don't have the proper information they need.\" He also had a concern that \u201c...because this transition is going to hit our most vulnerable citizens \u2014 the poor, the elderly, the disabled, and those with language barriers \u2014 the hardest.\" This call by Senators has also earned the support of president-elect Barack Obama, who will be inaugurated on Tuesday.\nThe government's subsidy program was set up to provide millions of $40 digital converter boxes to people who could not afford to buy a new television or upgrade to satellite or cable transmission. Many people complained that when they received their coupons, they were not able to use them as they had already expired. Currently, approximately 2 million Americans are on a waiting list to receive coupons for these digital converter boxes.\nAlthough members in the Senate as well as the president-elect support this idea, many television stations do not. Nat Ostroff, part of the Sinclair Broadcast Group which owns nearly 60 television stations, says that many stations had used a large sum of money to prepare for the transition to digital broadcast and would lose funds if the delay was passed. \"A delay would not be welcome for the broadcast stations themselves,\" he said, \"The sooner we can turn one of them off, in these hard times, the happier everyone would be.\" "}

He also stated that in order for the Israeli to withdraw from Gaza, Hamas \"must stop firing rockets\" into Israel, but that excessive rocket fire would cause the Israel Defense Forces to \"respond with force\". \n\"At two o'clock in the morning (0000 GMT) we will stop fire but we will continue to be deployed in Gaza and its surroundings.

He had pled guilty to the \"l\u00e8se majest\u00e9\" indictment that arose from a self-published 2005 novel, \"Verisimilitude\", of which only 50 copies were printed, and just seven sold.\nMeanwhile, yesterday, the Thai police charged a leading leftist political science professor, Dr. Giles Ji Ungpakorn, with l\u00e8se majest\u00e9.\nThe passage of concern, which comprised only 103 words or 12 lines, referred to a crown prince's love life. This allegedly insulted the lifestyle of H.R.H. Crown Prince Maha Vajiralongkorn, the only son of Thai King Bhumibol Adulyadej and Queen Sirikit.\nThe Royal Family of Thailand is the current ruling house of the Kingdom of Thailand, the Head of the House of the King of Thailand. It is protected by law (L\u00e8se majest\u00e9) from insult, with the charge carrying a maximum 15-year sentence.\n\"He has written a book that slandered the king, the crown prince of Thailand and the monarchy,\" the judge ruled. \"He was found guilty under criminal law article 112 and the court has sentenced him to six years, but due to his confession, which is beneficial to the case, the sentence is reduced to three years,\" the judge explained.\nNicolaides earlier confessed to having slandered 81-year-old King Bhumibol and his son Vajiralongkorn. \"I respect the King of Thailand. I was aware there were obscure laws (about the monarchy) but I didn't think they would apply to me,\" he tearfully said. He was arrested and detained at Bangkok's Suvarnabhumi Airport on August 31 as he tried to leave the country on a routine trip. Nicolaides was unaware of an arrest warrant issued on March 17, since he was not officially notified of the preliminary investigation. \nNicolaides had even sent copies of the published book to the Thai Ministry of Culture and Foreign Affairs, the national library and the Bureau of the Royal Household, for approval. In the decision, the Thai judge clarified that Nicolaides had placed the monarchy into disrepute, even obliquely, by his \"reckless choice of words\". The judgment cited a passage about the novel's fictional prince which caused \"dishonour\" to the royals and suggested an \"abuse of royal power.\" \nThe fictional passage in question goes as follows:\nNicolaides, who had worked in Thailand from 2003 to 2005 as a Chiang Rai university lecturer in hospitality and tourism, left the Bangkok court wearing a dark orange prison jumpsuit with his feet shackled. \"This is an Alice-in-Wonderland experience. I really believe that I am going to wake up and all of you will be gone. I would like to apologise. This can't be real. It feels like a bad dream,\" said Nicolaides. He felt \"dreadful,\" adding, \"I wish my family the best.\"\nHis brother Forde Nicolaides said Harry is not appealing but will request a Thai royal pardon. \"We're devastated. You might be able to hear my mother crying in the background. It's quite devastating for us. The whole case has been a massive emotional ordeal that has consumed our entire family. It's beyond belief,\" Forde was reported as saying.\nNicolaides' family has attributed some blame to the Rudd government for its failure to intervene in the case. Forde criticized Foreign Minister Stephen Smith: \"There is a huge expectation gap between what Australian citizens think the Australian government will do when they are in trouble overseas versus what they will do.\"\nHarry's father Socrates Nicolaides, 83, delivered an appeal letter to Mr. Rudd last week. \"I said to him, as one father to another father, please Mr. Prime Minister, I plead with you to do your utmost to do everything in your power to get Harry released,\" Mr. Nicolaides said. His wife Despina Nicolaides, 75, collapsed when she saw the video footage of her son. \"He has just written a book,\" she said amid tears.\nDespina Nicolaides said on Wednesday she appealed to King Bhumibol for a royal pardon, but her family has not received any reply from the Thai government. \"We don't know when really it will be okay for Harry to be released - they don't say anything,\" she said. \"I'm worrying sick. I hope that they will help us too like they did the Swiss people,\" she added.\nAccording to Foreign Minister Smith, an Australian consular staff in Bangkok visited Nicolaides 25 times in prison. \"We understand the anxiety that is being felt by Mr. Nicolaides and his family, however, he is subject to the legal and judicial processes of Thailand,\" the Smith's spokesman said. Moreover, Thai laws require a waiting period of 30 days from promulgation of the sentence before Nicolaides becomes eligible to apply for a Thai King's pardon.\nSmith mentioned that he had forwarded the Federal Government's letter to Thai Foreign Minister Kasit Piromya Monday for the Australian writer's pardon. \"I raised Mr. Nicolaides' case with then Thai Foreign Minister Sompong when we met at APEC in November last year,\" Mr. Smith added.\nIndependent Senator Nicholas (Nick) Xenophon has called on the Australian Federal Government to exert pressure on Thailand for the early repatriation of Nicolaides who has already served five months in jail. He has been refused bail four times. Xenophon is a South Australian barrister, anti-gambling campaigner and No Pokies, independent in the South Australian Legislative Council.\n\"The imprisonment has taken a heavy toll on his physical and mental health. He has lost weight, he has been continually unwell for extended periods of time and obviously psychologically he has found the experience of being in prison in Thailand very challenging,\" his Australian lawyer, Mark Dean SC said. \"Once that sentence is passed, if it's not a suspended sentence, then an application will be made for a royal pardon and we're hoping that that will be processed as quickly as possible,\" he added.\nActing Premier of Victoria, Justin Hulls said he has enquired about whether Victorian Government can provide assistance to Nicolaides. Hulls' legal team applied for a Thai royal pardon. His office has also communicated with lawyers of the case and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.\nAccording to Reporters Without Borders (RWB, or Reporters Sans Fronti\u00e8res), a Paris-based international non-governmental organization that advocates freedom of the press, the sentence imposed was \"a serious violation of free expression.\" The group has expressed concern at the use of the L\u00e8se majest\u00e9 laws to suppress political discussion and dissenting voices.\nMeanwhile, on Tuesday, the Thai police filed a l\u00e8se majest\u00e9 case against Dr. Giles Ji Ungpakorn, 55, a political science professor at Chulalongkorn University and Thailand's leading leftist political analyst. \"The government, the prime minister, should order that they (the lese majeste laws) cease being used against people and that a whole review of the law should take place,\" Giles said. \nThe accusations against Giles stem from the publishing a 2007 anti-military coup book, 'A Coup for the Rich,' which can be downloaded free on his blog http://www.wdpress.blog.co.uk. The 144-page critique is an academic textbook dealing with the Thailand political crisis 2005-2006, the bloodless coup of September 19, 2006 which overthrew former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra. Professor Ungpakorn's father Puey Ungpakorn was the Bank of Thailand's governor for 12 years and also a Thammasat University dean, and whose brother Jon Ungpakorn is a former senator.\nGiles was duly informed of the charges at the central Pathum Wan Police Station. He was granted 20 days to file a sworn counter-statement to the police, who will then rule on whether to file formal charges in the courts for trial. \"L\u00e8se majest\u00e9 is being used to destroy free speech,\" said Giles who denied the charges. \"The l\u00e8s majest\u00e9 laws are there to protect the military and to protect governments that come to power through military action. They're not really about protecting the monarchy,\" he added.\nThe Thai people believe that King Bhumibol and the Thai Royal Family are semi-divine. Accordingly, insulting the monarchy is taken extremely seriously in Thailand. Justice Minister Pirapan Salirathavibhaga earlier vowed to impose tougher regulations to implement the laws. Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva, however, announced last week that he was trying to \"strike the balance between upholding the law and allowing freedom of expression.\" Pirapan has reported that more than 10,000 websites have similar criminal contents. \nThe Thai government had already blocked about 4,000 websites, including 2,300 websites recently, for alleged violations of l\u00e8se majest\u00e9 law. As of last week, more than 17 criminal cases of insulting the royal family were still pending. About 400 more websites await a court restraining order, according to Information and Communication (ICT) Minister Ranongruk Suwanchawee.\nL\u00e8se majest\u00e9 cases have been filed against several people, including Chotisak On-soong, Jitra Kotchadej, Darunee Charnchoengsilpakul, Suwicha Thakhor, Sondhi Limthongkul, and social activists like Sulak Sivaraksa who were charged in the 1980s and 1990s. The King, however, has routinely granted pardons to most people jailed for l\u00e8se majest\u00e9. In March 2007, Swiss national Oliver Jufer was convicted of l\u00e8se majest\u00e9 and sentenced to 10 years for spray-painting on several portraits of the king while drunk in Chiang Mai, Thailand. Jufer was pardoned by the king on April 12, 2007. \nIn March 2008, Police Colonel Watanasak Mungkijakarndee filed a similar case against Jakrapob Penkhair for comments made in a Foreign Correspondents' Club (FCCT) event in August 2007. In 2008 BBC south-east Asia correspondent Jonathan Head was accused of l\u00e8se majest\u00e9 three times by Colonel Watanasak Mungkijakarndee. In the most recent case Watanasak filed new charges highlighting a conspiracy connecting Jonathan Head to Veera Musikapong at the FCCT.\nCanberra Thai Embassy Minister counselor, Saksee Phromyothi, on Wednesday defended the country's harsh l\u00e8se majest\u00e9, saying that, \"under Thailand's constitution, the king was above politics and was prevented from publicly defending himself from personal attacks.\" Mr. Saksee explained that \"99 per cent of foreigners convicted under this law get pardoned and then we deport them.\""}

The game is scheduled to take place on February 1 in Tampa Bay at Raymond James Stadium. The Steelers were the American Football Conference champion, defeating the Baltimore Ravens by a score of 23 to 14. Meanwhile, the Cardinals became the National Football Conference champions by defeating the Philadelphia Eagles 32 to 25.\nAFC.\nRavens quarterback Joe Flacco was the first rookie quarterback in the history of the NFL to help lead his team to two straight playoff victories, defeating the number 3 seeded Miami Dolphins to win the Wild Card round, and the number 1 seeded Tennessee Titans in the divisional round. They came in to the game against a number 2 seeded Steelers team that had already defeated them twice during the regular season. Early in the game the Steelers defense dominated the field, forcing him to only complete 3 out of 14 pass attempts and end the half with a lowly 9.8 quarterback rating and his team losing 13 to 7. By the beginning of the second half, snow was beginning to fall. Early in the third quarter, Flacco threw a 16 yard pass to wide receiver Derrick Mason, only to be sacked by safety Troy Polamalu for an 8-yard loss on the next play, forcing a punt for the Ravens. The Steelers were held on their next possession, forcing another punt. After the Ravens got the ball back, Flacco led the team down the field in what ended as a 58-yard touchdown drive to put the team up 16 to 14. However, near the end of the game, Flacco threw an errant pass intended for Mason that was intercepted by Polamalu and returned for a 40-yard defensive touchdown. This made the score 23 to 14, and essentially knocked the Ravens out of the game.\nWith 3:19 remaining in the game and the Ravens in possession of the ball for one last chance, a passing play was called. Flacco dropped back into a throwing position, and threw a short pass to running back Willis McGahee, who caught the ball and turned upfield. Going full speed up the field, Steelers safety Ryan Clark collided with McGahee, also running at full speed. The two made helmet-to-helmet-contact, knocking both players to the ground and knocking the ball out of the hands of McGahee. Ray Rice, another running back, commented \"It was tough to watch. He\u2019s like a brother to me.\" Clark was helped off of the field by the Steelers medical staff, but McGahee remained down on the field with movement in only his legs and arms. He told team doctors that he had significant pain in his neck, and was taken off the field on a cart and taken to a nearby hospital. It is unknown how severe the injuries are at this time.\nAfter the game, Ravens coach John Harbaugh said in a statement \"I\u2019m not going to sit here and say Joe played a certain way. Joe went out there and competed and battled and fought and tried to find a way to win the football game. So I certainly have no complaints about that.\" Flacco completed only 17 out of 30 pass attempts for 141 yards passing. He was also sacked 3 times and threw 3 interceptions. \"I\u2019m not blaming it on any rookie-wall stuff. I don\u2019t believe in any of that stuff,\" said Flacco.\nNFC.\n \nIn the NFC championship, the Arizona Cardinals had not made it to a Super Bowl in the past 60 years. They were matched up against the high-powered offense of the Philadelphia Eagles, who were the number 6 seed in the NFC. The Cardinals were the number 4 seed, defeating the number 5 seeded Atlanta Falcons on Wild Card weekend, and the number 2 seeded Carolina Panthers in the NFC Divisional playoff round. The Cardinals were led by quarterback Kurt Warner, who became the second quarterback in NFL history to lead two different teams to a Super Bowl, the other being the St. Louis Rams. During the first half, the Cardinals quickly took the lead. By halftime, their lead was extended to 18 points in what looked like an easy win for the team. However, in the third quarter, Eagles quarterback Donovan McNabb threw three touchdown passes, two of them being to tight end Brent Celek. After kicker David Akers missed an extra point attempt after the third touchdown pass, the score was 25 to 24 in favor of the Eagles. After the Cardinals received the ball, they drove up the field. With just under 3 minutes remaining in the game, Kurt Warner completed a game-winning touchdown pass to running back Tim Hightower, making the score 32 to 25. and sealing the game for the Cardinals.\nKurt Warner completed 21 passes out of 28 pass attempts, for a total of 279 passing yards. Wide receiver Larry Fitzgerald caught three touchdown passes of 9, 62, and 1 yard, building on his record-breaking playoff performance of 23 catches, 419 yards, and 5 receiving touchdowns over 3 games. \"It really set in when I saw the confetti. I always dreamed of being in the confetti. This is beyond my wildest dreams,\" said Cardinals linebacker Bertrand Berry after the game. On the other side, Donovan McNabb remarked on not making it to the Super Bowl again. \"You never want anything to end. It\u2019s tough when you\u2019re that close to making it to the Super Bowl,\" he commented."}

The worm has gone from just over 2 million Microsoft Windows computers infected to 8.9 million, according to estimates by anti-virus company F-Secure. Though Microsoft issued a patch with a severity rating of \"critical\" in mid-October 2008, just days after Conficker was first discovered, many business computers still have not applied the patch. \nMost to all of the infected computers are on corporate networks; Conficker cannot spread through the Internet or e-mails. Instead, when an infected laptop connects to a corporate network, the worm searches for vulnerable computers and attempts to guess its password. Conficker also infects any network shares the user may be connected to. The worm has a list of about one hundred common passwords, including \"password\" and \"qwerty\". Conficker also infects USB sticks, which then infect any Microsoft Windows computer the stick is plugged in to. \nAfter it gains access to the computer, Conficker adds itself to the Windows processes \"services.exe\", \"explorer.exe\" and \"svchost.exe\", then makes a copy of itself as a DLL file with a random five- to eight-character name. The worm also disables Windows services such as Windows Update and Windows Defender. Conficker also blocks access to most security-related sites, including Windows Update. The worm then checks several websites for the current date, then generates a domain name based on that date and downloads infected files from that domain. This domain is believed to be in Ukraine. Conficker makes itself very hard to remove by registering the downloaded files as kernel drivers and the DLL copy of itself of a service.\nMicrosoft has advised users to install the patch (security bulletin MS08-067), then run the latest edition of the Windows Malicious Software Removal Tool."}

I have protested many times, and I protest again in the strongest terms,\" stated Ban during a press conference in the Strip on Tuesday.

He also said that the UN would help the Palestinians overcome the devastation which he described as, \"shocking and alarming\". \nThe schools shelled by Israel, were housing refugees when they were hit with tank shells, one of the attacks killed 50 refugees.

In planning for almost two years a US$5 million backing from Malaysian business tycoons Tony Fernandes of AirAsia and Indonesian media mogul Erick Thoir should see the league commence in September this year. The goal is to boost the mainstream popularity of basketball which, according to organizers of the new league, is already the second most popular team sport behind football.\nFernandes believes using overseas professional players will help increase the competitiveness and skills of the local ASEAN players. Fernandes said, \"The aim is to develop local talent. Foreign players from outside ASEAN will be role models. Maybe one day our players will play in the NBA.\"\nSingapore's \"The Straits Times\" quoted secretary general of the International Basketball Federation (FIBA), Patrick Baumann, as saying \"Asia was ready for a professional league but warned organizers will have to ensure it doesn't fade away after a few years. The time is right but it is not going to be simple to sustain the league\". He further added that \"there has to be good entertainment. The clubs need to be managed professionally and well funded. You cannot have the league for one or two years and then stop.\"\nAddressing concerns over the current financial crisis and its possible impact on the launch of the league Fernandes said, \"Yes, there will be a lot of obstacles and road blocks. But no mountain will stop us. During an economic downturn like now, this new league will create jobs.\"\nThe composition of the league is still under discussion however it is expected that at least eight teams will part of the series this year. Each nation will be permitted a maximum of two privately owned teams. Other details including prize money, sponsorship and number of games is still in planning. The league will be organised by the South-east Asian Basketball Association which governs basketball across the region.\nSingapore Slingers are expected to be one of the first confirmed teams in the new competition. Bob Turner, CEO of the Slingers, said \"We are definitely very interested. We believe that this will take the sport to the next level and we hope to confirm our entry as soon as possible.\"\nThe league is tentatively scheduled to start in September 2009 and continue until February 2010. It will initially consist of eight teams that will play on a home-and-away basis. The champion will be the last team standing after a knock-out playoff round."}

Prior reports beginning on January 14, 2009 claimed that the poster was based on a different photo, a shot by photographer Jim Young from January 2007. However, on January 20, 2009 Flickr user \"stevesimula\" and blog commenters identified the Associated Press photo that appears to be a much closer match.\nFairey had revealed that he found the photographic basis for his four-color screen-printed design using , but could not or would not identify which photo he used. News broke of a supposed source only days ago. According to an earlier attempted analysis by Michael Cramer, it was a photo from \"TIME\" magazine which was reversed and stretched slightly. That photo was credited to \"Jonathan Daniel\" of , but this turned out to be a misattribution. Reporter James Danziger of \"The Daily Beast\" tracked down the actual photographer for the \"TIME\" shot, Jim Young, and in his words \"solved the biggest photographic mystery of the 2008 election\". Reuters also celebrated their photo as the basis for such a phenomenon as Fairey's poster, and a print of the photo was sold to the in . But it took only a few days for internet sleuths to show that, while similar, the Jim Young photo was not the one Fairey used.\nThe most convincing evidence that a different photo is indeed the one comes from Flickr: \"stevesimula\" produced a graphic comparing the two purported sources. The side lighting in the alternative photo creates highlight and shadow areas closely matching those Fairey used in his high-contrast stencil-like image, and the overlaid images line up precisely from Obama's eyes to the shadow on his collar to his tie. Jim Young's photo would have required manipulation to simply match the profile of Fairey's design, even without considering details like the highlights and shadows.\nThe actual photo came from the Associated Press, as Wikimedians discovered using the \"reverse image search engine\" \"TinEye.com\". That tip led photographer Tom Gralish of \"The Philadelphia Inquirer\" to the original photo through a Google image search for both \"Obama\" and \"associated press\". The original contained metadata identifying the creator as Mannie Garcia, which Gralish quickly confirmed. The shot came from an April 2006 event where George Clooney, not then-Senator Obama, was the main attraction: Clooney was addressing the about his trip to Darfur.\nFairey's appropriation raises questions of intellectual property, as apparently no attempt was made to secure reproduction rights from the Associated Press. Sales of the image (on posters, clothing, and other paraphernalia) were used to fund the production of more posters in support of the Obama campaign, and raised Fairey's public image considerably. A large hand-finished collage version was recently acquired by the Smithsonian Institution's . The purchase price is not known."}

On day one, the group hacked into the website, replacing the content with links to images of alleged e-mail conversations. The e-mails appear to be from the founder's e-mail account, accusing organization members of forgery and using the site for their own personal financial gains. The website was also replaced with Anonymous's logo and a message. On January 22, they again attacked the website, by means of a Distributed Denial-of-service attack (DDoS), bringing it offline periodically throughout the day. Anonymous attacked the Scientology website in 2008 with a DDoS attack, taking it off-line for at least two days.\n\"It has come to our attention that the creators of the no cussing club, McKay and Brent Hatch have done so at great personal gain. Their material promotes the organization as the brainchild of their 14-year-old son, when actually the material is written by his parents, who also manage his profitable career while using his speaking events to plug their own material,\" said Anonymous on the hacked website. On Encyclopedia Dramatica, a satire Wiki, they claim further responsibility for the hack and exposition saying they managed to break into McKay and Brent Hatch's email accounts. \"[the accounts got] haxx0rd and via this astonishing development passwords were got and a certain website got its shit ruined.\" \nAccording to the NCC's website, it has 20,000 members worldwide, was founded in 2007 by McKay Hatch, a 14-year-old boy, and aims at discouraging swearing in public places such as schools. In 2008, McKay even succeeded in making cussing illegal in his hometown of South Pasadena, California and has appeared on various talk shows such as that of Doctor Phil. However, according to e-mails leaked to Wikinews, allegedly written by the boy's father Brent, a motivational speaker also owning Dawson Publishing, the parents are allegedly using the site and their son's material for their own personal financial gain. Anonymous also claims that the parents have forged some of their son's writings and claim it to be his.\nThe e-mails allege that Brent along with his publishing company, the name which \"nocussing.com\" is also registered under, were trying to set up assemblies in the No Cussing Club's name at schools across the United States for US$1,500.00 per show and would then pocket the money, doing the same for postcards they created for churches and schools.\n\"McKay spoke last night to a group of 40 people, and at the end of his presentation, there wasn't a dry eye in the crowd. I know this is going to work because the message is so important. Thanks for all you do and I hope we can work together for a long time, and of course make money in the process,\" said Brent in an alleged e-mail conversation on November 25, 2008. Earlier in August 2008, Brent spoke about hoping to reach a \"goal\" of \"2.5 million dollars\" by selling thousands of postcards to \"schools and churches\".\nOn January 19, 2009, ABC News.com reported that McKay claimed Anonymous was sending him and his family hate e-mail and death threats, nearly 50,000 per day, \"almost all of them filled with obscenities\" and spam. On the NCC's website, McKay calls himself the \"most cyberbullied kid on the planet\" because of Anonymous's attacks.\n\"A lot of people were saying I was taking away their freedom of speech,\" said McKay to ABC News on January 16. \"All I was trying to do was raise awareness.\" He says he formed the club because his schoolmates were sick of hearing people swear in public. Wikinews contacted the NCC to confirm or deny the reports, but would only say that \"the FBI is [working] on it [the case]\" including \"our attorney and we will press charges\" against those who are responsible for the crimes.\nAnonymous is known to prank and hack websites and e-mail accounts. In September 2008, the group hacked into BillOreilly.com, the official website of Fox News Channel commentator Bill O'Reilly, exposing personal information of the site's users in a document posted on the internet.\nThe NCC is located in South Pasadena. According to the California Penal Code \u00a7502 part C of the computer hacking laws, depending on the offense if caught, punishments could be a \"fine not exceeding ten thousand dollars ($10,000), or by imprisonment in the state prison for 16 months, or two or three years, or by both that fine and imprisonment, or by a fine not exceeding five thousand dollars ($5,000), or by imprisonment in a county jail not exceeding one year, or by both that fine and imprisonment\".\nOn October 20, 2008, Dmitriy Guzner, aged 18 from New Jersey, admitted to the charges related to carrying out the DDoS attack on Scientology's website. He was subsequently charged with computer hacking crimes and faces a maximum sentence of ten years imprisonment. "}

The openly gay mayor said Breedlove was 18 years of age when the sexual relationship began, however the two met when Breedlove was still a minor. Adams also admitted he previously lied about the relationship and asked Breedlove to also lie about the relationship during the time Adams was running for mayor. The Oregon Attorney General's office is investigating the matter.\n\"In the past, I have characterized my relationship with Beau Breedlove as purely nonsexual. That is not true. Beau Breedlove and I had a sexual relationship for a few months in the summer of 2005 after he turned 18 years of age. I want to apologize to the people of Portland for my dishonesty and for embarrassing them. My job now is to come clean \u2014 I mucked it up \u2014 and to press forward,\" said Adams in a statement to the media.\nNewspapers such as \"The Oregonian\", \"Just Out\", the \"Portland Tribune\", and the \"Portland Business Journal\", as well as the Portland Police Union have called for Adams to resign. Others such as city commissioner Randy Leonard and Multnomah County district attorney Michael Schrunk want an investigation to be launched into Adams' actions. Portland commissioner Randy Leonard expressed distraught when he heard Adams had lied about the relationship. Leonard previously defended Adams when the allegations first came to light. There are also allegations that Breedlove was only 17 when the sexual relationship started, bringing up memories of the sex scandal that tainted former mayor Neil Goldschmidt's legacy after he admitted to sex with his 14-year-old babysitter.\n\"The part I'm having trouble with is the thing he did was to ask the young man to lie. That I'm having a hard time understanding,\" said Leonard in a statement. Adams has no plans to resign as mayor.\nBreedlove met Adams in April 2005 at the Oregon State Capitol when Breedlove was an intern for then Oregon House of Representatives member Kim Thatcher. Breedlove sought Adams out for advice on coming out of the closet. Later, the two spent time together and Adams attended Breedlove's 18th birthday party.\nRumors of a sexual relationship surfaced in the fall of 2007, but Adams denied any sexual relationship at that time. Adams is currently in a relationship with reporter Peter Zuckerman."}

Some politicians have expressed concern that foreign donations to the foundation may create conflicts of interest for Hillary, as the Secretary of State is the country's top diplomat. The foundation employs Bill Clinton as its head.\n\"I intend to vote for her confirmation.

Kennedy, issued a statement at midnight saying she had quit her bid because of \"personal reasons\".\nA close associate of Kennedy, who spoke under the condition of anonymity, said that the decision was not related to the recent health issues of Senator Ted Kennedy (D-MA), Caroline Kennedy's uncle. The senator suffered a seizure Tuesday while attending a luncheon with the newly inaugurated U.S. President Barack Obama in the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C..

He sold the tainted milk to Sanlu and some other dairy companies. His brother Geng Jinzhu was sentenced to eight years imprisonment for assisting in adding the melamine. \nA suspended capital punishment sentence, pending a review, with two years probation, was handed down to Gao Junjie. Under the law, a suspended death sentence is equivalent to life imprisonment with good behavior. The court ruled that Gao designed more than 70 tons of melamine-tainted \"protein powder\" in a Zhengding County underground factory near Shijiazhuang. His wife Xiao Yu who assisted him, was also sentenced to five years imprisonment.\nSanlu Group General Manager Tian Wenhua, 66, a native of Nangang Village in Zhengding County, who was charged under Articles 144 and 150 of the criminal code, was sentenced to life imprisonment for producing and selling fake or substandard products. She was also fined 20 million yuan (US$2.92 million) while Sanlu, which has been declared bankrupt, was fined 49.37 million yuan ($7.3 million). \nTian Wenhua plans to appeal the guilty verdict on grounds of lack of evidence, said her lawyer Liang Zikai on Saturday. Tian testified last month during her trial that she decided not to stop production of the tainted milk products because a Fonterra designated board member handed her a document which states that a maximum of 20 mg of melamine was allowed in every kg of milk in the European Union. Liang opined that Tian should instead be charged with \"liability in a major accident,\" which is punishable by up to seven years imprisonment, instead of manufacturing and selling fake or substandard products. \nAccording to Zhang Deli, chief procurator of the Hebei Provincial People's Procuratorate, Chinese police have arrested another 39 people in connection with the scandal. Authorities last year also arrested 12 milk dealers and suppliers who allegedly sold contaminated milk to Sanlu, and six people were charged with selling melamine. \nIn late December, 17 people involved in producing, selling, buying and adding melamine to raw milk went on trial. Tian Wenhua and three other Sanlu executives appeared in court in Shijiazhuang, charged with producing and selling fake or substandard milk contaminated with melamine. Tian pleaded guilty, and told the court during her 14-hour December 31 trial that she learned about the tainted milk complaints and problems with her company's BeiBei milk powder from consumer complaints in mid-May. \nShe then apparently led a working team to handle the case, but her company did not stop producing and selling formula until about September 11. She also did not report to the Shijiazhuang city government until August 2.\nThe court also sentenced Zhang Yanzhang, 20, to the lesser penalty of life imprisonment. Yanzhang worked with Zhang Yujun, buying and reselling the protein powder. The convicts were deprived of their political rights for life.\nXue Jianzhong, owner of an industrial chemical shop, and Zhang Yanjun were punished with life imprisonment and 15 years jail sentence respectively. The court found them responsible for employment of workers to produce about 200 tons of the tainted infant milk formula, and selling supplies to Sanlu, earning more than one million yuan. \n\"From October 2007 to August 2008, Zhang Yujun produced 775.6 tons of 'protein powder' that contained the toxic chemical of melamine, and sold more than 600 tons of it with a total value of 6.83 million yuan [$998,000]. He sold 230 tons of the \"protein powder\" to Zhang Yanzhang, who will stay behind bars for the rest of his life under the same charge. Both Zhangs were 'fully aware of the harm of melamine' while they produced and sold the chemical, and should be charged for endangering the public security,\" the Court ruled.\nThe local court also imposed jail sentences of between five years and 15 years upon three top Sanlu executives. Wang Yuliang and Hang Zhiqi, both former deputy general managers, and Wu Jusheng, a former raw milk department manager, were respectively sentenced to 15 years, eight years and five years imprisonment. In addition, the court directed Wang to pay multi-million dollar fines. In December, Wang Yuliang had appeared at the Shijiazhuang local court in a wheelchair, after what the Chinese state-controlled media said was a failed suicide attempt.\nThe judgment also states \"the infant milk powder was then resold to private milk collectors in Shijiazhuang, Tangsan, Xingtai and Zhangjiakou in Hebei.\" Some collectors added it to raw milk to elevate apparent protein levels, and the milk was then resold to Sanlu Group.\n\"The Chinese government authorities have been paying great attention to food safety and product quality,\" Yu Jiang Yu, spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said. \"After the case broke out, the Chinese government strengthened rules and regulations and took a lot of other measures to strengthen regulations and monitor food safety,\" she added.\nIn the People's Republic of China, the intermediate people's court is the second lowest local people's court. Under the Organic Law of the People's Courts of the People's Republic of China, it has jurisdiction over important local cases in the first instance and hear appeal cases from the basic people's court.\nThe 2008 Chinese milk scandal was a food safety incident in China involving milk and infant formula, and other food materials and components, which had been adulterated with melamine. In November 2008, the Chinese government reported an estimated 300,000 victims have suffered; six infants have died from kidney stones and other acute renal infections, while 860 babies were hospitalized. \nMelamine is normally used to make plastics, fertilizer, coatings and laminates, wood adhesives, fabric coatings, ceiling tiles and flame retardants. It was added by the accused to infant milk powder, making it appear to have a higher protein content. In 2004, a watered-down milk resulted in 13 Chinese infant deaths from malnutrition.\nThe tainted milk scandal hit the headlines on 16 July, after sixteen babies in Gansu Province who had been fed on milk powder produced by Shijiazhuang-based Sanlu Group were diagnosed with kidney stones. Sanlu is 43% owned by New Zealand's Fonterra. After the initial probe on Sanlu, government authorities confirmed the health problem existed to a lesser degree in products from 21 other companies, including Mengniu, Yili, and Yashili.\nFrom August 2 to September 12 last year Sanlu produced 904 tonnes of melamine-tainted infant milk powder. It sold 813 tonnes of the fake or substandard products, making 47.5 million yuan ($13.25 million). In December, Xinhua reported that the Ministry of Health confirmed 290,000 victims, including 51,900 hospitalized. It further acknowledged reports of \"11 suspected deaths from melamine contaminated milk powder from provinces, but officially confirmed 3 deaths.\"\nSanlu Group which filed a bankruptcy petition, that was accepted by the Shijiazhuang Intermediate People's Court last month, and the other 21 dairy companies, have proposed a 1.1 billion yuan ($160 million) compensation plan for court settlement. The court appointed receiver was granted six months to conclude the sale of Sanlu's assets for distribution to creditors. The 22 dairy companies offered \"families whose children died would receive 200,000 yuan ($29,000), while others would receive 30,000 yuan ($4,380) for serious cases of kidney stones and 2,000 yuan ($290) for less severe cases.\"\nSanlu stopped production on September 12 amid huge debts estimated at 1.1 billion yuan. On December 19, the company borrowed 902 million yuan for medical and compensation payment to victims of the scandal. On January 16, Sanlu paid compensation of 200,000 yuan (29,247 U.S. dollars) to Yi Yongsheng and Jiao Hongfang, Gangu County villagers, the parents of the first baby who died. \n\"Children under three years old, who had drunk tainted milk and had disease symptoms could still come to local hospitals for check-ups, and would receive free treatment if diagnosed with stones in the urinary system,\" said Mao Qun'an, spokesman of the Ministry of Health on Thursday, adding that \"the nationwide screening for sickened children has basically come to an end.\" \n\"As of Thursday, about 90% of families of 262,662 children who were sickened after drinking the melamine-contaminated milk products had signed compensation agreements with involved enterprises and accepted compensation,\" the China Dairy Industry Association said Friday, without revealing, however, the amount of damages paid. The Association (CDIA) also created a fund for payment of the medical bills for the sickened babies until they reach the age of 18. \nChinese data shows that those parents who signed the state-backed compensation deal include the families of six children officially confirmed dead, and all but two of 891 made seriously ill, the report said. Families of 23,651 children made ill by melamine tainted milk, however, have not received the compensation offer, because of \"wrong or untrue\" registration details, said Xinhua.\nSeveral Chinese parents, however, demanded higher levels of damages from the government. Zhao Lianhai announced Friday that he and three other parents were filing a petition to the Ministry of Health. The letter calls for \"free medical care and follow-up services for all victims, reimbursement for treatment already paid for, and further research into the long-term health effects of melamine among other demands,\" the petition duly signed by some 550 aggrieved parents and Zhao states. \n\"Children are the future of every family, and moreover, they are the future of this country. As consumers, we have been greatly damaged,\" the petition alleged. Chinese investigators also confirmed the presence of melamine in nearly 70 milk products from more than 20 companies, quality control official Li Changjiang admitted.\nIn addition, a group of Chinese lawyers, led by administrator Lin Zheng, filed Tuesday a $5.2 million lawsuit with the Supreme People's Court of the People's Republic of China (under Chief Grand Justice Wang Shengjunin), in Beijing, on behalf of the families of 213 children's families. The class-action product liability case against 22 dairy companies, include the largest case seeking $73,000 compensation for a dead child.\nAccording to a statement to the Shanghai Stock Exchange Market Friday, China's Inner Mongolia Yili Industrial Group Company, which has a domestic market share of milk powder at 8 percent, reported a net loss in 2008 because of the milk scandal. A Morgan Stanley report states the expected company's 2008 loss at 2.3 billion yuan. The scandal also affected Yili's domestic rivals China Mengniu Dairy Company Limited and the Bright Group. Mengniu suffered an expected net loss of 900 million yuan despite earnings in the first half of 2008, while the Bright Group posted a third quarter loss at 271 million yuan last year.\nNew Zealand dairy giant Fonterra, said Saturday it accepted the Chinese court's guilty verdicts but alleged it had no knowledge of the criminal actions taken by those involved. \"We accept the court's findings but Fonterra supports the New Zealand Government's position on the death penalty. We have been shocked and disturbed by the information that has come to hand as a result of the judicial process,\" said Fonterra Chief Executive Andrew Ferrier. \n\"Fonterra deeply regrets the harm and pain this tragedy has caused so many Chinese families,\" he added. \"We certainly would never have approved of these actions. I am appalled that the four individuals deliberately released product containing melamine. These actions were never reported to the Sanlu Board and fundamentally go against the ethics and values of Fonterra,\" Ferrier noted.\nFonterra, which controls more than 95 percent of New Zealand's milk supply, is the nation' biggest multinational business, its second-biggest foreign currency earner and accounts for more than 24 percent of the nation's exports. Fonterra was legally responsible for informing Chinese health authorities of the tainted milk scandal in August, and by December it had written off its $200 million investment in Sanlu Group.\nAmnesty International also strongly voiced its opposition to the imposition of capital punishment by the Chinese local court and raised concerns about New Zealand's implication in the milk scandal. \"The death penalty will not put right the immense suffering caused by these men. The death penalty is the ultimate, cruel and inhumane punishment and New Zealand must take a stand to prevent further abuses of human rights.\" AI New Zealand chief executive Patrick Holmes said on Saturday.\n\"The New Zealand government does not condone the death sentence but we respect their right to take a very serious attitude to what was extremely serious offending,\" said John Phillip Key, the 38th and current Prime Minister of New Zealand and leader of the National Party. He criticized Fonterra's response Monday, saying, \"Fonterra did not have control of the vertical production chain, in other words they were making the milk powder not the supply of the milk, so it was a difficult position and they did not know until quite late in the piece. Nevertheless they probably could front more for this sort of thing.\"\nKeith Locke, current New Zealand MP, and the opposition Green Party foreign affairs spokesman, who was first elected to parliament in 1999 called on the government and Fonterra to respond strongly against the Chinese verdict. \"They show the harshness of the regime towards anyone who embarrasses it, whether they are real criminals, whistleblowers or dissenters,\" he said. \"Many Chinese knew the milk was being contaminated but said nothing for fear of repercussions from those in authority. Fonterra could not get any action from local officials when it first discovered the contamination. There was only movement, some time later, when the matter became public,\" he noted.\nGreen Party explained \"it is time Fonterra drops its overly cautious act.\" The party, however, stressed the death penalty is not a answer to the problems which created the Chinese milk scandal. \"The Green Party is totally opposed to the death penalty. We would like to see the government and, indeed, Fonterra, speaking out and urging the Chinese government to stop the death penalty,\" said Green Party MP Sue Kedgley."}

The report comes as Israeli naval gunships went silent for the first time since Israel announced their ceasefire on January 18, with Hamas following a few days later.\nThe report states that the military used white phosphorous bombs in civilian areas, with at least twenty phosphorous shells fired by a reserve paratroops brigade into a densely packed area of Beit Lahiya. The United Nations head quarters and a hospital in Gaza City were also bombed with white phosphorus.\n\"We saw streets and alleyways littered with evidence of the use of white phosphorus, including still burning wedges and the remnants of the shells and canisters fired by the Israeli army,\" said Christopher Cobb-Smith, with Amnesty International who is also an expert in the field of weapons.\nAn official for the IDF said that two types of phosphorus weapons were used in the offensive. One contained little phosphorous and was primarily used as a smoke bomb and is fired from 155mm shells. The other type of bomb, made in 81mm and 120mm shells, are fired from mortar guns. These shells used a computer guidance system and Israel says that the system failed when the UN and hospital were hit. Phosphorus burns when it comes in contact with oxygen, and can cause serious injuries to humans if they are hit with it. Doctors in Gaza say that dozens of civilians have been treated for burns related to the use of the weapons.\nThe Israeli military had claimed that they had never used the bomb during the offensive, despite the existence of photographic and video evidence. The use of the white phosphorous bombs against civilian buildings is illegal under Protocol 3 of the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons, agreed in 1980. However, Israel, which signed the treaty in 1995, is not party to Protocol 3. Israel claims they were following international law when using the weapons. 200 of the bombs were used, 180 of which were used on farmland and orchards, where militants were launching rockets into southern Israel. The other 20 were used in residential areas, but the IDF says they were fired in areas that rockets were being fired from.\nNearly 1,300 Palestinians, the majority being civilians, died and nearly 5,450 were injured during the three-week offensive. Thirteen Israeli soldiers were also killed. "}

He lured her to the basement where she was locked in a room, handcuffed and drugged. He is charged with incest, false imprisonment, murder, rape and the enslavement.

He also serves as the Union Minister for Finance, succeeding P. Chidambaram.\n\"The 76-year-old Prime Minister is doing fine now. He is conscious, stable, comfortable and is making rapid progress. He also met his family and congratulated all doctors. [His] ventilator has been taken off and he is breathing on his own. This is an important step,\" said Dr. Ramakant Panda, one of the surgeons, after the 11-hour procedure on Saturday.\nAccording to critical care specialist Dr. Vijay D'Silva, who has been entrusted with his post-operative care, Singh has been given a liquid diet since morning including a cup of tea, and was speaking to doctors after the procedure. \"The way you [doctors] are taking care of me, you should also take care of other people\", Dr. D'Silva, who received his basic medical training in Nagpur and headed the ICU at Mumbai's Jaslok and Lilavati Hospitals before he helped set up the ICU at the ultra-modern Asian Heart Institute, quoted Singh as saying.\n\"We started the operation at 7:45 am. The second operation always takes longer and makes it difficult to reach the heart. We did a total of five by-passes to clear multiple blockages in his arteries. Surgery was the long term answer since there were many blockages. We will take the PM out of the breathing machine in the next 2-3 hours and the PM should stay for three days in the ICU and then 4-5 days more in the hospital,\" Drs. Panda and D'Silva explained.\nSingh's personal physician and AIIMS cardiac surgeon, Dr. K. S. Reddy, has predicted the PM will be allowed to attend to some official work in two weeks, to most of the duties in four weeks and will be able to resume office in six weeks. \"PM was sent to the Operation Theatre at 6:40 am, surgery was done at 8:45 am and was concluded at 7:30 pm. PM was sent back to the ICU at 8:55 pm,\" said Dr. Reddy.\n\"The team has brought about 20 boxes of special equipment with it. Earlier, Dr. K. S. Reddy had discussions with Dr. Panda in connection with the line of treatment to be followed,\" the team of 11 doctors said.\nThe team of surgeons made a 6 to 7 inch incision along the scar that marked the PM's 1990 bypass operation, and he was given five grafts. \"The new grafts, all 3 mm long, will last the PM the rest of his life,\" said Dr. Pradyot Kumar Rath from the Asian Heart Institute. \"If the PM could have been so active with all the blockages, he can be even more active now,\" Dr Panda said. \nSingh underwent a coronary angiography at the AIIMS hospital on Tuesday and Wednesday and was discharged on Thursday. The tests results revealed multiple arterial blockages and Singh returned to hospital on Friday for pre-surgery tests. \nExternal Minister Pranab Kumar Mukherjee, age 73, has been given the charge of Finance Ministry after he held meetings with Congress President Sonia Gandhi and then Prime Minister Singh.

He had earlier been operated for a benign enlarged prostate in 2007, and for nerve compression in both wrists in 2006 and cataract removal procedure last year, officials said.\nThe Congress Party, which leads the coalition Government, has said that he will remain Prime Minister if Congress and its allies win again. But Congress is reportedly planning to replace him, possibly within two years, with Rahul Gandhi, the 38-year-old son of Sonia Gandhi, the Italian-born Congress leader. \"Days are not far off for Rahul Gandhi to become Indian Prime Minister,\" Mr Mukherjee said earlier this month. \nRahul is an Indian politician and member of the Parliament of India, representing the Amethi constituency. He is a member of the Nehru-Gandhi family, the most prominent political family in India. He is the son of current Italian-born Congress President Sonia Gandhi, and former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, who was assassinated in 1991. Gandhi was 14 years old when his grandmother, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, was assassinated by her security guards.

This move is meant to let readers help keep the reference work up-to-date by collaboration. \nIn expanding and maintaining entries online, users whose editorial suggestions are accepted and published entirely or in part will be credited by name in the section of the article that lists contributors.\nThe new website features will be available on the site within the next twenty-four hours. According to the , \"Cauz is promising a 20-minute turnover on these edits, but that number could go up dramatically if the company cannot anticipate a large influx of edits at once.\" \nBritannica, however, explained that it would not allow a Wikipedia form of editing which allows a wide range of users to make contributions. EB's novel user choice will include enrollment of experts in a reward scheme and invitation of selected readers to contribute. Several readers will also be allowed to use Britannica materials to contribute their own articles that will be featured on the site. \n\"We are not abdicating our responsibility as publishers or burying it under the now-fashionable 'wisdom of the crowds',\" wrote Jorge Cauz in his blog. \"We believe that the creation and documentation of knowledge is a collaborative process but not a democratic one,\" Cauz noted, explaining further that \"these experts would sit alongside the encyclopaedia entries and the official material would carry a 'Britannica Checked' stamp, to distinguish it from the user-generated content.\"\nCauz also announced the unveiling by Britannica of a beta (trial) version of what will become the finished Britannica Online website, which will include a re-design and the addition of web-based tools for readers and users to upload their own reference materials. The new features that Britannica will roll out over the next six months also include an article rating system and a comprehensive list of contributors by subject area.\nArticles developed by Britannica's own editors also appear in the printed volumes, which are published every two years, though material created by what Cauz called their \"community of scholars\" will only appear online.\n\u201cWikipedia contributes to the spread of information and many people are happy with it as their only source of reference, as are many people happy to eat McDonald\u2019s every day,\u201d said Cauz, who discussed differences between Britannica and Wikipedia features of online editing. \u201cThat\u2019s the last thing we want to be. We are a different type of animal, catering to a different type of crowd,\u201d he added.\nCauz said the company will retain its staff of about 100\u00a0full-time editors and over 4,000\u00a0expert contributors. \u201cI think the future is likely going to be that in every media segment there has to be a symbiotic relationship between editor and reader,\u201d said Cauz, adding that each article will have a detailed history showing changes and who made them, as in Wikipedia. In 1933, Britannica became the first encyclopaedia to introduce a \"continuous revision\" policy, with continuous reprinting such that every article is updated on a regular schedule.\nUnlike Wikipedia, which allows anonymous edits through a user's IP address being logged, Britannica's new features strictly require contributors or users to register, revealing their real names and addresses, prior to modifying or creating their own articles. Contributions from non-academic users will sit in a separate section.\nA new or changed feature called \u201cSuggest Edit\u201d button will allow readers of a particular article to suggest information clarification, post questions to contributors or add to the existing text, subject to Britannica editors' approval. \"What we are trying to do is shifting \u2026 to a much more proactive role for the user and reader where the reader is not only going to learn from reading the article but by modifying the article and - importantly - by maybe creating his own content or her own content,\" wrote Cauz.\nCauz faulted Google for setting Wikipedia higher in pagerank than Britannica. He explained that, in EB, new efforts to participate in online collaboration of encyclopedic content are deemed by recognizing experts as a requirement in order to achieve objectivity and high quality. During his tenure, officials from Britannica have become outspoken in their of Wikipedia articles' contents. \nIn July 2006, Cauz personally entered the fray in an interview in , in which he stated that Wikipedia had \"decline(d) into a hulking, mediocre mass of uneven, unreliable, and, many times, unreadable articles\" and that \"Wikipedia is to Britannica as \"\" is to the .\"\nThe 241-year-old publication, Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, is a general published by a privately held company, , and is the oldest English-language encyclopaedia still in print. The \"Britannica\" articles are directed at educated adult readers. First published between 1768 and 1771 in Edinburgh, Scotland, it quickly grew in popularity and size, with its third edition in 1801 reaching over 21 volumes.\nBritannica's latest 15th edition has a unique three-part structure: a 12-volume ' of short articles (generally having fewer than 750\u00a0words), a 17-volume Macrop\u00e6dia of long articles (having from two to 310\u00a0pages) and a single ' volume created to give a outline of human knowledge. The \"Microp\u00e6dia\" is devised for quick fact-checking and as a door to the \"Macrop\u00e6dia\".\nAt present, Britannica offers optical disc, online and mobile versions. The Britannica Ultimate Reference Suite 2006 DVD has over 55 million words and just over 100,000 articles, including 73,645 regular Britannica articles. The Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online website has more than 120,000 articles and is updated regularly. EB's virtual space was founded in 1994 and contains articles comprised of over 46 million words.\nIn February 2007, Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, Inc. said that it was working with to launch a mobile encyclopedia, to enable users to send questions via text messages. Replies would then be forwarded by AskMenow based on Britannicas' articles. \nAs Britannica is a business, the company needed to charge, and Web access to the archives cost $70 a year. In April 2008, \"Britannica Webshare,\" a version of the online Encyclopaedia Britannica has been available for free, but only for Web publishers. The simple process requires signing up, giving a site URL, a description, and approval by the company. \u201cThis program is intended for people who publish with some regularity on the Internet, be they bloggers, webmasters, or writers. We reserve the right to deny participation to anyone who in our judgment doesn\u2019t qualify,\u201d said .\nIn June 2008, Britannica announced an initiative to facilitate collaboration between online expert and amateur scholarly contributors for Britannica's on-line content (in the spirit of a ), with editorial oversight from Britannica staff. According to its statement titled \"Britannica's New Site: More Participation, Collaboration from Experts and Readers,\" approved contributions would be credited, though contributing automatically grants Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, Inc. perpetual, irrevocable license to those contributions.\n has, however, reported that it became clear how steep of a climb Britannica faces. \"Wikipedia received a massive 97 percent share of the online encyclopedia market or visits U.S. Web surfers made to online encyclopedias last week,\" Web monitoring company said Friday. \"MSN was second with 1.27 percent of visits, followed by Encyclopedia.com (0.76 percent), Fact Monster (0.72 percent) and, in fifth place, Britannica.com (0.57 percent). Britannica.com's share of U.S. visits dropped 53 percent last month compared with December 2007,\" Hitwise added.\nWhile Britannica.com has 1.5 million visitors per day, Wikipedia attracts about six million, The Times reported. Hitwise also said that as of last week, Wikipedia ranked the 13th-most-visited site on the Web overall, while Britannica.com was 2,349th. The essential difference is Wikipedia does not charge any fee, while Britannica.com requires a paid subscription for access of some contents. \nBritannica, however, is issuing a \"Encyclopaedia Britannica 2009 Ultimate Edition\" - the \u00a340 2009 DVD edition of its famous print encyclopaedia.\n\"One of the big questions still on the table is whether Britannica will open its content or maintain its premium membership paid wall. In order to compete with Wikipedia in the Google [search results], Britannica needs to build up inbound links. If content is locked up behind the paid content walls, people will be much more likely to link to other websites with free content -- such as that available on Wikipedia,\" Hitwise analyst Heather Hopkins noted.\nWikipedia, a not-for-profit collaborative online encyclopedia, in its Wikipedia Foundation's recent drive for public donations, had aimed to raise $US6 million over the course of six months. On January 1, \"it had met the target, from more than 125,000 donors,\" said Wikipedia head honcho and co-founder Jimmy Wales. He has invoked Wikipedia's \"free-culture movement\", and its mission \"to bring free knowledge to the planet, free of charge and free of advertising\".\n\"Wikipedia is the new frontier of human knowledge,\" wrote Anonymous, donating $US100. American Patrick Culligan left another comment, saying, \"Accurate information is what enables society to act in the appropriate way in which we can change the world. History cannot be left for the winners to write.\" Another said: \"Wikipedia is one of those 'big ideas' which will change our world for the better.\"\nAfter Encyclopedia Britannica's announcement that it is introducing a more open editing system, web 2.0 giant Wikipedia has considered attempts to move away from its free and open editing system. Academics, scholars and others have long criticized the writing principles fostered by Wikipedia amid vandals having often changed Wikipedia entries resulting to erroneous reports. \nNow, for the first time, the online encyclopedia has considered restricting the edits that users can make. The system known internally as \"Flagged Revisions,\" has been sparked off by inaccurate changes after a Wikipedia user \"Gfdjklsdgiojksdkf\" and an anonymous editor respectively edited articles to say that both U.S. Senators and had died. The errors were caught and duly corrected after about five minutes, but they were up long enough for the , among other media outlets, to notice.\nIn just the latest incidents in a long and rich history of vandalism since its 2001 launch, and Apple's CEO Steve Jobs, among others, have also been falsely reported as dead on Wikipedia. Wiki means \"fast\" in Hawaiian and it certainly is, even amid subtle vandalism, since anyone can amend its 2.7m entries. Wikipedia has long struggled with such prankery, and has ever since worked closely with its community to overcome it without adopting harsh protections. \nAs Wikipedia itself acknowledges, \"Allowing anyone to edit Wikipedia means that it is more easily vandalized or susceptible to unchecked information, which requires removal.\" In the proposed process, only registered or reliable users could have their material or edits immediately appear to the general public visiting Wikipedia. Other contributors' edits or changes will first be reviewed, signed off, or \u201cflagged\u201d by reliable users. \n\u201cThis nonsense would have been 100 percent prevented by Flagged Revisions,\u201d said Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales under the header \u201cWhy I Am Asking Flagged Revisions Be Turned On Now,\u201d on his user page. \u201c[Instances of misinformation] could [...] have been prevented by protection or semi-protection, but [..] [many are] breaking news [stories] and we want people to be able to participate (so protection is out) and even to participate in good faith for the first time ever (so semi-protection is out),\" explained Wales who calls for monitoring to prevent false entries. \nWales said that a poll revealed 60 percent of Wikipedians favored the new proposal and that it would be a \u201ctime limited test.\u201d He noted that the delay should be less than the German Wikipedia allowed: \u201cless than 1 week, hopefully a lot less, because we will only be using it on a subset of articles, the boundaries of which can be adjusted over time to manage the backlog.\u201d\nWales issued a statement requesting implementation of the extension: \u201cTo the Wikimedia Foundation: per the poll of the English Wikipedia community and upon my personal recommendation, please turn on the flagged revisions feature as approved in the poll.\u201d But the community response was further debate.\n As of February 2, his request hasn't been implemented.\nApparently the Wikipedia German edition has been using a form of the Flagged Revisions system since May as a test case. It has, however, led to a delay of up to three weeks in getting some new articles and edits published, for critics have said that the system is very labor intensive and comments can take weeks to appear. Wales, however, pointed out that the system he was proposing was only for biographies of living people. Wikipedia has provided comprehensive and up-to-minute entries on the in April 2007 and the this past November as the events were still taking place.\nWhile some participants in the debate have argued that the rule change is unnecessary, some have described it in terms of an ethical imperative. As one administrator wrote: \"In the vast majority of cases, a Wikipedia article on an individual will be the very highest-ranking search engine result when a search is conducted on the name of that person. This affects the lives of the people we write about on a daily basis. To suggest that Wikipedia does not have profound obligations to do its best to keep these articles free of defamatory, gossipy and privacy-invading material is to suggest that we are without obligation to consider the real-world impacts of our actions and the work we are doing.\" \nOthers have argued that practical considerations should prevent a change that could result in a large backlog of unreviewed edits. \"Flagged revisions will suffocate under its own weight,\" claimed administrator DragonflySixtyseven. Still other Wikipedian editors further argue that the current system works just fine.\nSome consider the split could ultimately threaten the future of the dominant online encyclopedia. \"The big issue is that while we have majority support, we don't have consensus, and that's the way we have always made our decisions,\" Jake Wartenberg user and member of RC patrol chimed in. \"A lot of editors are becoming disenchanted with the project; we are losing them all the time,\" he added. By way of reply, amidst the embarrassing debacle, Mr. Wales has reached out to help and offered a compromise, inviting the opposition to submit alternative suggestions until the 29th of January.\n\u201cImplementing this functionality is really a volunteer community decision. We know the discussion about flagged revs is still taking place on English Wikipedia, but at this stage, it appears the majority of the community are behind this decision. As that discussion unfolds, we\u2019ll have a better sense of the timing,\u201d Jay Walsh, a spokesman for the Wikimedia Foundation, in a rejoinder, wrote in his e-mail message, explaining the status of the proposed restriction.\n\"Now seems an excellent time for Wikipedia to pause and take stock. It has proved the surprising wisdom of crowds as well as their utter idiocy. Its challenge now is to harness the enthusiasm of those volunteers while becoming a more reliable, better written source. And at some point, surely, its founders might want to turn it into a commercial venture. As almost said: \"No one but a blockhead ever edited, excepted for money,\" said , a British freelance journalist and novelist.\n\"The suggestion of increased moderation on Wikipedia would divide the community. The site has built its reputation on being 'the encyclopedia that anyone can edit'. It's less radical to be 'the encyclopedia that anyone can edit as long as their edits are approved by a trusted Wikipedian' but that's what co-founder Jimmy Wales has suggested. Wikipedia's openness is its strength,\" said of The Daily Telegraph, asking, \"is it most valuable feature its openness or its accuracy?\"\nWales' position is that \"I consider our BLP issue to be so important that I think it is actually unethical to not use a tool which holds great promise for helping with the problem, now that it has been successfully tested elsewhere. Anyone who would like to see this tool not go into practice needs to start by convincing people that either (a) it is OK for the BLP vandalism problem to continue or (b) there is a better way to solve it.\" "}

Ten children and two adults were injured.\nThe alleged perpetrator, a 20-year-old man from nearby Sint-Niklaas, was arrested in the neighbouring municipality of Lebbeke shortly after the crime. Belgian news website nieuwsblad.be have named the arrested man as Kim De Gelder.\nThe attack.\nThe attacker wore a bullet-proof vest under his clothes and a backpack containing a knife, an axe and a fake pistol. Two other knives were found near the crime scene.\nThe prosecutor confirmed that the man's face was painted white with blackened eyes as he committed the crime, which led international media to make comparisons to the Joker, the villain from the Batman series.\n\"I have a question,\" the killer told the first employee he encountered, after which he immediately stabbed her, and started his rampage. One female day care worker attempted to disarm the killer while others locked the doors. The killer stabbed employees trying to carry children to safety.\nThe arrested man is not cooperating with the investigation and has not confessed. The prosecutor described his attitude as \"passive\". \"He says nothing to his questioners. He is absolutely uncooperative,\" the prosecutor explained. Yesterday, media reported that the killer was laughing at the officers who were questioning him, but the prosecutor today denied these speculations.\nAccording to the crime scene investigation, the man entered the building through an unlocked side-entrance which gave immediate access to the room with the babies. He stabbed several of them, then went to another room where he stabbed other children. He then fled on the bicycle on which he had arrived.\nPanic struck in Dendermonde amidst fears that the man would attack more cr\u00e8ches or schools. There were reports that the killer carried a note with names and addresses of other day care centres or schools nearby, something which the prosecutor could not comment on. The Associated Press says three judicial officials anonymously confirmed that the attacker carried addresses of three other nurseries. Following news of the stabbings, all schools in Dendermonde were ordered to keep all gates shut.\nEyewitness Hans Staelens told reporters that he had noticed a suspicious character in the street where the day care centre 'Fable Land' was located. He described him as \"not too tall, thin, red hair, dark eyes, like make-up\".\nThe alleged killer lived alone and was unemployed, but does not have a criminal record. \"There is no element whatsoever that makes us believe he has a psychiatric history,\" the prosecutor told the press at a conference today. He has commissioned three psychiatrists to examine the man. Kim D. was not under the influence of drugs or alcohol.\nVictims.\nOne child and one woman died in the day care centre itself, with another child dying in hospital. All injured are reported to be in stable condition. Three children and one adult remain in intensive care. Five others also remain hospitalised, although several are expected to be discharged at some point during the weekend.\n54-year-old Marita Blindeman, who was killed in the attack, worked in the day care centre, which was sponsored by social services, since she was 18. Since the death of her father, she lived with, and took care of, both her mother and her sister, who has a learning disability. Just two years ago, she started having a relationship with a man, according to her son in a letter to newspapers.\nOnly six of the 18 children in the cr\u00e8che, all under the age of three, were uninjured. Meanwhile, the decision has been taken not to reopen the day care centre, but to provide day care in other facilities. Six employees were present during the attack.\nResponse to the incident.\nFriday evening, the Belgian crown prince and his wife visited the crime scene. The couple, who have four children, were moved deeply by the killings.\nSome hundred people have signed a mourning registry in Dendermonde's city hall, and flowers and teddy bears were left at the day care centre. A silent demonstration is scheduled for tomorrow afternoon and a mourning ceremony will be held on Monday evening.\nSeveral media outlets have discussed the safety of day care centres. Minister Veerle Heeren said she would consider additional safety measures if the investigation suggests it, but also added that, \"a day care centre should be a haven, not a prison.\""}

It traveled south-eastwards towards the south-east coast of France throughout Saturday morning, finally reaching there at 1:00 pm. It is expected to head north-eastwards over and the Adriatic Sea, but without causing damage. Low pressure systems are fairly common in at this time of year. Some reports have called it the storm of the decade; BBC meteorologist Alex Deakin said \"Saturday's storm is being described as the most damaging since that of December 1999 which killed 88 people.\"\nFour children aged between 9 and 12 died at a sports hall in , near Barcelona. The children intended on playing baseball, but sought shelter inside a covered area made of concrete with a corrugated iron roof. The structure collapsed, as a result of the wind. Local people and fire-fighters were at the scene in aiding children to escape the rubble. Three children died at the scene, a fourth died in hospital and 16 have been treated for injuries. \nOther fatalities include a woman, who died after a wall collapsed and a man struck by a falling tree in the Barcelona area. In Landes, south-west France, a falling tree struck a driver; a 78-year-old man was hit by debris and another man, aged 75, was crushed by a tree. A wall crushed a man in Aigues de Busot in the south-east of Spain. A policeman was struck by a falling tree as he directed traffic in Burela and a sailor from a cargo ship died when the vessel got into trouble off the coast of Galicia. In Burgos, Spain, a woman was crushed by a door.\nApproximately 1.7 million homes in France and tens of thousands of homes in Spain experienced power cuts. A woman, aged 73, died in France after a power-outage stopped her breathing machine. Road and rail links were blocked and airports closed. Airports in Bordeaux, Biarritz, Pau and Toulouse were shut, as well as train services, leaving hundreds of passengers stranded overnight. \nMich\u00e8le Alliot-Marie, the French interior minister, stated that in addition to the 300 civil security agents located in the Landes region of France, another 715 agents would be deployed. She also expressed her intent to fly there today, after the high winds have decreased. French President Nicolas Sarkozy told reporters he would travel to the affected area tomorrow. In Bordeaux's Gironde region, 19 residents of a retirement home were evacuated by rescuers following its rooftop being blown away. Authorities have also evacuated campers from the pine forests in Landes.\nThousands were evacuated from nearby housing estates in La Nuc\u00eda, north of Benidorm in Alicante, as the Spanish Army helped to fight a forest fire, which was started by a felled electricity pylon. There were also forest fires in the region of Catalonia, while Spain put emergency services on high alert. Waves over 20 metres high were registered off the northern coast of Spain and dolphins were stranded on beaches in the region as a result of high winds."}

Search and rescue (SAR) groups worldwide will only monitor the 406 MHz frequency, which is dedicated to digital locators.\nThe 406 MHz digital band has many advantages over the older analog systems. Since the locators send data to satellites, rather than just provide a continuous signal, much more will be known about the emergency before a SAR group arrives, such as the type of vehicle and owner. In addition, the accuracy will be greatly enhanced from a 1400 square kilometre (500 square mile) search zone down to just 90m (100 yards) if the locator has a GPS fix. The most important reason for the switch is the reduction of false positives. With the older analog bands, only about one in every 50 alerts was real, whereas with the digital system that is reduced to about one in every 17 alerts being real. \nWith fewer false positives and greatly increased accuracy, SAR groups around the world will be better able and faster to respond to life-threatening emergencies within the critical \"golden day\". They will also be able to do this with fewer wasted resources.\nThe phase-out of analog transponders has been a long time coming. The first warnings were sent by the US Coast Guard in 2000, and analog devices have not been manufactured in the last several years. For most large boats the cost of upgrading to the new system was negligible. The change February 1 is worldwide, with both the International Civil Aviation Organization and the International Maritime Organization recommending the switch."}

Appearing on \"Fox News Sunday\" yesterday, McCain echoed his campaign platform in saying, \"We need to make tax cuts permanent, and we need to make a commitment that there'll be no new taxes.\"\nMcCain and other Republicans say they are unhappy with the bill introduced in the House of Representatives, which combines roughly $550 billion in domestic spending with $275 billion in tax cuts. McCain believes not enough Republican proposals have been integrated into the plan, which he fears will result in the plan becoming \"just another spending project\" rather than a job creator.\n\"Republicans have not been brought in, to the degree that we should be in, to these negotiations and discussions. So far, as far as I can tell, no Republican proposal has been incorporated,\" McCain said. \"We're losing sight of what the stimulus is all about, and that is job creation.\"\nThe Arizona senator is known for his bipartisan efforts in Washington, D.C., but he defined his role in the new Senate as the \"loyal opposition\", which does not mean \"that I or my party will be a rubber stamp\" for Obama, he said.\nIn his first weekly address since being sworn in, President Obama explained the stimulus plan in further detail, calling it a plan to \"immediately jumpstart job creation as well as long-term economic growth.\" He outlined several of the bill's priorities, including the creation or salvation of up to four million jobs, as well as sweeping investments in health care, education, energy and infrastructure.\nAmong these investments are a new electricity grid with more than 3,000 miles of transmission lines, the weatherization of 2.5 million homes, health insurance protection for more than 8 million Americans, a renovation of over 10,000 schools, a project to repair thousands of miles of roadways, and an expansion of broadband Internet access.\nObama also laid out the rationale behind the stimulus, saying that \"unprecedented action\" is necessary in order to prevent further economic distress. \"Our economy could fall $1 trillion short of its full capacity, which translates into more than $12,000 in lost income for a family of four,\" Obama said. \"In short, if we do not act boldly and swiftly, a bad situation could become dramatically worse.\"\nThe president addressed the skepticism surrounding the stimulus package, pledging to \"root out waste, inefficiency, and unnecessary spending\", while holding the government accountable for its actions. \"We won\u2019t just throw money at our problems,\" Obama said. \"We'll invest in what works.\"\nStill, Republicans such as House Minority Leader John Boehner are skeptical of the plan's effectiveness in rebuilding the economy. \"I think a lot of Republicans will vote no because it's a lot of wasteful Washington spending\", he commented on \"Meet the Press\", repeating McCain's call for less federal spending and more tax cuts.\nExamples of \"wasteful\" spending cited by Republicans include millions of coupons to aid in the digital television transition, $200 million for new sod on the National Mall, and $360 million to fight sexually transmitted diseases, which includes funding for contraceptives. House Republicans have claimed it will take 10 years before the economy feels the effect of a stimulus, and that the combined spending of the stimulus and the financial bailouts of last year will leave future generations with over $2 trillion of debt.\nIn response to the stimulus plan being pushed through Congress, Boehner and Republican Whip Eric Cantor presented Obama with an alternative stimulus plan on Friday, one that relies exclusively on income and business tax cuts. \"Our plan offers fast-acting tax relief, not slow-moving and wasteful government spending,\" Boehner said. The counterproposal includes an income tax reduction that would save families an estimated $3,200 a year.\nDespite this opposition, the stimulus bill is expected to pass through Congress by mid-February, as the Republican minority does not have enough votes to stop its approval. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell expressed a general support of the plan at a White House meeting with Obama and other congressional leaders. \"I do think we'll be able to meet the president's deadline of getting the package to him by mid-February,\" McConnell said. The bill is expected to go before Congress for a vote on Monday, February 2.\nObama's top economic adviser Lawrence Summers defended the stimulus plan while on \"Meet the Press\". He said the bill was intended to balance the long-term initiatives mentioned above with the tax cuts desired by Republicans. He also said Obama was committed to spending three quarters of the stimulus money within 18 months."}

Here begins the new Bolivia. Here we begin to reach true equality,\" Morales told a crowd in front of the flag-draped balcony of Palacio Quemado in La Paz, the administrative capital of Bolivia.\nRatified with about 60 percent support in a referendum on Sunday based on exit polls, the new constitution lets Morales run for re-election later this year and grants him tighter control over the economy. An official vote count of some 3.8 million registered voters who cast their ballots will be announced February 4.\nWith the new Magna Carta, South America's second poorest country after Guyana becomes a leader in the regional \"pink tide\" of left-wing governments that have ousted traditional elites and challenged American influence. The new constitution's elements include recognition of 36 distinct Indian \"nations\", increasing the autonomy of Bolivia's nine regions, establishing state control over key natural resources such as gas, and setting limits on land ownership.\nMorales has also promised Bolivia\u2019s native groups that the constitution will keep the white \"oligarchs\" who ruled the country for 183 years from returning to power. The leftist constitution empowers the government to distribute land to indigenous communities and apportion ethnic quotas for state jobs, including congress seats. \"After 500 years, we have retaken the Plaza Murillo! Internal colonialism and external colonialism end here too. Sisters and brothers, neo-liberalism ends here too!\" said Morales.\nVice-President \u00c1lvaro MarceloGarc\u00eda Linera, a principal author of the draft constitution, hailed Sunday's referendum results, saying, \"this will be an egalitarian Bolivia, a Bolivia that leaves behind a dark, colonial, racist past.\" Linera, however, has acknowledged that the government has provoked deep divisions and faces vehement oppositions from many of the traditional elite, coming from many mixed-race people in the fertile eastern lowlands which rejected the draft charter. \n\"I am not saying there will be no more conflict, there will be tensions for a while, I say a decade ... but we will have built a state on three principles: the economy under state control, equality, and the territorial decentralization of power,\" he said. The new constitution was rejected in four opposition-controlled regions: the tropical lowlands of Pando, Santa Cruz, Tarija and Beni, which contain most of Bolivia's natural gas production and are responsible for most of its agricultural output. \nWith the split vote, Oscar Ortiz, the president of the opposition-controlled Senate, has voiced concerns that the charter has become a war of ideas. \"The result [of the vote] ... will show deep divisions between regions and between Bolivians in each region. A confrontation between ideas and visions about how this country will build its common future will continue,\" he said ahead of the referendum.\nFormer president Carlos Mesa has predicted that the constitution is unlikely to pave the way for real social change amid continuing political struggles. \"We will have so many legal battles to go through that I fear that last year's belligerent climate will continue this year. President Morales is not coming at this with open hands, he has built trenches and dug in,\" Mr. Mesa said.\nMorales has dismissed the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and the U.S. Ambassador to Bolivia, accusing both of conspiracy with the opposition to overthrow his government. The U.S. Embassy in La Paz has called the accusations \"false and absurd.\" Morales has been very popular among the poor and among Aymara, Quechua and Guarani.\nThe new constitution's 411 articles address underrepresentation of indigenous peoples. \"It may be the equivalent of Spain\u2019s Reconquest of the Iberian Peninsula from the Moors in 1492. But instead of the blood spilled in that process, Bolivia is advancing in a democratic process that does not exclude or subjugate anyone,\" said Xavier Alb\u00f3, a Jesuit scholar and linguist. \n\"Finally we have a constitution that leaves racism and hatred aside, because indigenous people are included,\" said Adolfo Chavez, president of the Confederation of Indigenous people of Bolivia (CIDOB).\nMorales' ascent to presidency.\nIn March 2005, then-President Mesa resigned. The President of Senate Hormando Vaca D\u00edez assumed office as the country's temporary President. Mesa resigned because of the announcement of highway blockages by Evo Morales and leaders of both the coca growers and the Movement Toward Socialism (MAS). The blockages were meant to pressure the Legislative so that the Hydrocarbons Law, which would raise taxes levied on hydrocarbon extraction from 18% to 50%, could be approved.\nThe MAS is a political party formed basically by coca-growing campesinos (farmers or farmworkers), communists, admirers of Fidel Castro and indigenous people. The party is against the U.S. government and the alleged American influence in the region, neoliberalism and globalization.\nIn December 2005, Morales won the presidential election in Bolivia to serve a five-year term. In the 2005 election, his victory marked the country's first election of an indigenous head of state, but this claim gendered controversy due to the number of mestizo presidents who were elected or appointed before him. He was openly criticized by such figures as Mario Vargas Llosa, who accuses the President of fomenting racial divisions in an increasingly mestizo Latin America.\nMorales ran on a campaign of restoring coca farming in Bolivia, in spite of the U.S. program aimed at reducing the ability to grow coca to curb the cocaine industry. Morales is an Aymara Indian and former coca farmer himself, and has described his victory as a signal that \"a new history of Bolivia begins, a history where we search for equality, justice and peace with social justice.\"\nMorales is an admirer of Fidel Castro and he says he is also inspired by the President Hugo Chavez of Venezuela and Brazilian President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva. Morales supports the creation of an anti-imperialist block formed by Latin-American and Arabian countries against the U.S., which is being organized by the Brazilian President.\n2008 unrest in Bolivia.\nIn August 2008, Bolivian unrest began against Morales and calls for greater autonomy for the country's eastern departments grew. Santa Cruz, Beni, Pando, Tarija and Chuquisaca called strikes and protests to oppose the central government's plan to divert part of the national direct tax on hydrocarbons in favor of its \"Renta Dignidad\" pension plan. Brief clashes occurred in the Santa Cruz de la Sierra between police and armed youths enforcing the strike. Violence between Morales' supporters and opponents resulted in at least 30 deaths.\nIn September 2008, Bolivian authorities declared a state of emergency in Pando, where Bolivian troops took control of the airport in the region's capital, Cobija. Amid preparations to retake the city, 20 people were killed. In October 2008, the government and the opposition held talks following which resulted in the signing of a compromise agreement which set the referendum on 25 January 2009 and early elections on December 6, 2009. \nMorales in turn promised that he would not run again in 2014 after his likely reelection in 2009, despite the fact that he would be allowed to do so under the new constitution. The new constitution was drafted by the Constituent Assembly in 2007. The referendum set forth two questions: whether to approve the new constitution and whether to limit private estates to 1,000 or 5,000 hectares. "}

Offenders will receive a warning for a first offence, an \u00a380 immediate fine for a second offence and arrest and court proceedings for a third. This differs from the system in place for other Class B substances. However, the new system has not yet gone before the British parliament and will not be enforced until Wednesday, with the reclassification taking place today.\nThe Magistrates' Association have argued that the new process had penalty rates lower than other Class B drugs and that the decision to take prosecutions away from the courts until a third offence sent out the wrong message to potential users.\nThe deputy chair of the Association, John Fassenfelt, told the BBC that the new system suggested to young people that cannabis was not as bad as other Class B drugs. \"It's a dual justice system\", he said. \"If you smoke or take another Class B drug you'll be brought to court, if you take cannabis you'll be given a fine. Where's the justice in that?\" \nCannabis was a Class B substance until 2004, when it was reclassified to the more lenient Class C after a campaign that began in 1979. Mental health campaigners have since pushed for a return to Class B, and the government enacted this change today.\nA cross-media advertising campaign will launch next month to explain the changes, at a cost of \u00a32.2 million. Class A substances include ecstasy, LSD, cocaine, heroin and crack. Class B now includes amphetamines and cannabis, whilst Class C now includes tranquilisers, GHB and the veterinary anaesthetic Ketamine. "}

The suit is for more than US$750 million (\u00a3528M) \u2014 about half of the estimated proceeds from Marvel's movies. \nPlaintiff Stan Lee Media (SLM) has four shareholders who live in Florida, California and Canada, and include Jose Abadin and Nelson Thall. The company is suing for recovery of civil damages representing one-half of film and book earnings from such blockbuster films as Spider-Man, Iron Man, X-Men, Hulk, and Fantastic Four franchises. \nDefendants are accused of copyright violations over both the Marvel superhero characters and intellectual properties created by Stan Lee. Spider-Man's three cinematic outings, starring Tobey Maguire, earned more than $1bn (\u00a3702m). \"Most of Marvel's financial success, including from the films, comes out of assets created by Stan Lee that are the subject of this suit,\" the complaint states.\nLee, 86, has denied the allegations and has previously filed his own $50 million counter lawsuit against SLM, claiming the company has destroyed his name and reputation and prevented his effort to develop such properties as \"The Accuser\" and \"The Drifter\" and others via his first-look deals with Disney and Virgin Comics. Lee also co-created Daredevil, Doctor Strange and Thor.\nFormer dot-com company STM further alleges that it has agreed to pay Lee a $250,000 annual salary plus $100 million in company stock in exchange for the rights to the superhero characters. \"That money should have gone to the corporation,\" said Garbus. Lee's counsel, Mark Williams, replied: \"We look forward to a positive resolution for Stan Lee and his family.\" Marvel has said the court pleadings, which were filed in U.S. District Court in Manhattan, are filled with \"ridiculous claims\". \nSLM ran out of operating capital during the dot-com meltdown in December 2000, closing operations entirely by December 19 of that year. The company was placed into Chapter 11 Reorganization in Bankruptcy by Stan Lee in 2001. During the insolvency proceedings, Lee assigned the major character franchises he had created to his new public company, POW! Entertainment, without the bankruptcy court's approval. \nTwo multi-billion dollar lawsuits for damages were filed against Lee, his new company, his new partner Arthur Lieberman and Marvel Entertainment for cybersquatting and failure to disclose the existence and value of the Rights Assignment Lee made to the company when he founded it.\nThe company remained under bankruptcy protection until the US Trustee for the Central District of California moved to dismiss the bankruptcy proceedings for failure of the company as debtor in possession to comply with basic requirements of filing monthly reports and paying quarterly fees to the Trustee. SLM was taken back by the shareholders after its dismissal from bankruptcy and hired a legal and accounting forensic consultant to review all transactions that occurred during bankruptcy.\nBy November 2006, all of the officers and directors of the company had resigned or abandoned their positions and the company's lawyers for the debtors in possession attempted to obtain court authorization to destroy or dispose of the company's books and records. This initiated a long-running legal battle between shareholders and the company's founder, Lee.\nThe plaintiffs in this most recent suit contend that Lee, Perlmutter, Arthur Lieberman and Avi Arad conspired in bad faith to conceal and misappropriate financial interests in Lee's creations assigned to Stan Lee Media in 1998. SLM's meltdown involved its former President Peter F. Paul fleeing to Brazil, contributions made to Bill and Hillary Clinton, Paul's extradition and more. In 2007, SLM filed a $5 billion lawsuit in which it claimed co-ownership of all of Stan Lee's creations for Marvel. "}

It means therefore, an average-sized dairy farm's production increases by an extra 6,800 gallons a year.\n\"Just as people respond better to the personal touch, cows also feel happier and more relaxed if they are given a bit more one-to-one attention,\" said Dr Catherine Douglas, lead researcher of the university's School of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development. \"By placing more importance on the individual, such as calling a cow by her name or interacting with the animal more as it grows up, we can not only improve the animal's welfare and her perception of humans, but also increase milk production,\" she added.\nDrs Douglas and Peter Rowlinson have submitted the paper's conclusion: \"What our study shows is what many good, caring farmers have long since believed. Our data suggests that, on the whole, UK dairy farmers regard their cows as intelligent beings capable of experiencing a range of emotions.\" The scientific paper also finds that \"if cows are slightly fearful of humans, they could produce [the hormone] cortisol, which suppresses milk production,\" Douglas noted. \"Farmers who have named their cows, probably have a better relationship with them. They're less fearful, more relaxed and less stressed, so that could have an effect on milk yield,\" she added.\nSouth Norfolk goldtop-milk producer Su Mahon, one of the country's top breeder of Jersey dairy herds, agreed with Newcastle's findings. \"We treat all our cows like one of the family and maybe that's why we produce more milk,\" said Mrs Mahon. \u201cThe Jersey has got a mind of its own and is very intelligent. We had a cow called Florence who opened all the gates and we had to get the welder to put catches on to stop her. One of our customers asked me the other day: 'Do your cows really know their names?' I said: I really haven't a clue. We always call them by their names - Florence or whatever. But whether they really do, goodness knows,\u201d she added.\nThe researchers' comparative study of production from the country's National Milk Records reveals that \"dairy farmers who reported calling their cows by name got 2,105 gallons (7,938 liters) out of their cows, compared with 2,029 gallons (7,680 liters) per 10-month lactation cycle, and regardless of the farm size or how much the cows were fed. (Some 46 percent of the farmers named their cows.)\"\nThe Newcastle University team which has interviewed 516 UK dairy farmers, has discovered that almost half - 48% - called the cows by name, thereby cutting stress levels and reported a higher milk yield, than the 54% that did not give their cattle names and treated as just one of a herd. The study also reveals cows were made more docile while being milked.\n\"We love our cows here at Eachwick, and every one of them has a name,\" said Dennis Gibb, with his brother Richard who co-owns Eachwick Red House Farm outside of Newcastle. \"Collectively, we refer to them as 'our ladies,' but we know every one of them and each one has her own personality. They aren't just our livelihood, they're part of the family,\" Gibb explained.\n\"My brother-in-law Bobby milks the cows and nearly all of them have their own name, which is quite something when there are about 200 of them. He would be quite happy to talk about every one of them. I think this research is great but I am not at all surprised by it. When you are working with cows on a daily basis you do get to know them individually and give then names.\" Jackie Maxwell noted. Jackie and her husband Neill jointly operate the award-winning Doddington Dairy at Wooler, Doddington, Northumberland, which makes organic ice cream and cheeses with milk from its own Friesian cows.\nBut Marcia Endres, a University of Minnesota associate professor of dairy science, has criticized the Newcastle finding. \"Individual care is important and could make a difference in health and productivity. But I would not necessarily say that just giving cows a name would be a foolproof indicator of better care,\" she noted. According to a 2007 \"The Scientist\" article, named or otherwise, dairy cattle make six times more milk today than they did in the 1990s. \"One reason is growth hormone that many U.S. farmers now inject their cows with to increase their milk output; another is milking practices that extend farther into cows' pregnancies, according to the article; selective breeding also makes for lots of lactation,\" it states.\nCritics claimed the research was flawed and confused a correlation with causation. \"Basically they asked farmers how to get more milk and whatever half the farmers said was the conclusion,\" said Hank Campbell, author of Scientific Blogging. In 1996, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs provided for a complex new cattle passport system where farmers were issued with passport identities. The first calf born under the new regime were given names like \"UK121216100001.\"\nDr Douglas, however, counters that England doesn\u2019t permit dairy cattle to be injected hormones. The European Union and Canada have banned recombinant bovine growth hormone (rGBH), which increases mastitis infection, requiring antibiotics treatment of infected animals. According to the Center for Food Safety, rGBH-treated cows also have higher levels of the hormone insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1), which may be associated with cancer.\nIn August 2008, Live Science published a study which revealed that cows have strange sixth sense of magnetic direction and are not as prone to cow-tipping.

The device would limit the amount of power the resident uses and would essentially shut it off if that limit is reached, or if the resident fails to pay the outstanding bill within 10 days of installation. In order for the electricity to be turned back on, the limiter must be reset by pushing a button.\nBay City power says that a warning, indicating that the power was to be turned off and a limiter installed, had been placed on Schur's front door. Despite that, the company says that they are now \"looking at our website and possibly doing an automated phone message. We obviously need to get the word out.\"\nThe autopsy performed on Schur's body concluded that he had died \"a slow, painful death\" caused by hypothermia. Dr. Kanu Virani, who performed the autopsy, explained: \"Hypothermia shuts the whole system down, slowly. It's not easy to die from hypothermia without first realizing your fingers and toes feel like they're burning.\"\nIt was less than 32 degrees Fahrenheit (0 Centigrade) in Schur's home when neighbors found Schur dead on January 17. Virani commented that it was his first time performing an autopsy on a body in which \"the person froze to death indoors.\"\n\"His furnace was not running - the insides of his windows were full of ice the morning we found him,\" said George A. Pauwels Jr., who was with his wife when they found Schur's body.\nIn Michigan it is illegal for a utility company to disconnect power to any home between November 1 and March 31 when a resident is over the age of 65. Limiters are also not supposed to be used during that time frame. However, municipally-owned electric utilities like the one in Bay City, are not regulated by the state. The Michigan state attorney general's office has launched an investigation into the incident.\nResidents around Schur's home say he was hard of hearing, and the city states that the device's function and operation were never explained to him. When word of the story got around, people from all over the United States began to call the city in anger.\n\"I've taken calls from Canada, Massachusetts, Texas, New York, Alabama - and that's just the ones I can think of off the top of my head,\" said Melody Roth of the city's administrative office, who also added that people from all over are \"calling all city departments, not just our office.\"\nSchur has no known children, and his wife had died several years prior to the incident."}

The ICRC also claims that hundreds of civilians in the area have been killed or wounded, though an exact number was not given.\nSri Lankan officials say these figures are too high, though they have acknowledged the existence of some civilian casualties.

However, the UN says the LTTE have fired at their convoys and refused to allow evacuations to the nearest hospital, while the military had resumed firing during an attempted evacuation. The UN condemned this as a violation of international humanitarian law, which requires a guarantee of safe passage for aid workers on both sides. \n\"It's an incredibly serious situation,\" said James Elder, a U.N. spokesman. \"We have a very large number of people, including tens of thousands of children, trapped in a fast-shrinking conflict zone.\" ICRC spokeswoman Sarasi Wijeratne did not explicitly accuse the LTTE of firing on their convoy, simply stating that the convoy had not been given full security assurances.\nSri Lankan military officials say the rebels are nearly defeated, with only about 30 kilometers of seafront remaining under their control. Military spokesman Brigadier Udaya Nanayakkara claims the LTTE have 1,200 well-trained cadres left, while the Sri Lankan army has around 50,000 troops deployed."}

Ahmadinejad says these \"dark crimes\" include the economic sanctions imposed since the country's 1979 revolution, attempts to halt Iran's nuclear program, and America's support of Israel.\n\"Those who speak of change must apologize to the Iranian people and try to repair their past bad acts and the crimes they committed against Iran,\" the president said in the city of Kermanshah. The remarks were Ahmadinejad's first address to the US since Obama took office on January 20, though he did congratulate Obama after his election in November.\nAhmadinejad singled out the George W. Bush administration for its support of Israel and its expansion of US military presence around the world. He called for an end to \"interfering in other people's affairs\", which meant a withdrawal of all US troops. \"If someone wants to talk with us in the language that Bush used,\" he said, \"even if he uses new words, our response will be the same that we gave to Bush during the past years\". \nThough the Iranian president did not mention Obama by name, he did have a lot to say about his predecessor. \"Mr. Bush has gone into the trash can of history with a very black and shameful file full of treachery and killings,\" Ahmadinejad was quoted as saying. \"He left and, God willing, he will go to hell.\"\nThe remarks came a day after President Obama made a much-publicized appearance on Al Arabiya, an Arabic news channel. During the interview, Obama repeated a theme from his inauguration speech, saying \"if countries like Iran are willing to unclench their fist, they will find an extended hand from us\". Diplomacy will be a very important tool in US relations with Iran, he clarified.\nIt is not clear if Ahmadinejad's speech was meant as a response to Obama's interview, but some of his remarks seemed to echo Obama's campaign theme of \"change\". Ahmadinejad said there are two types of change he could expect from Washington. \"First is a fundamental and effective change,\" he said. \"The second ... is a change of tactics.\" He said Iran would welcome change from the US, but only if it were \"truly serious and basic\".\nAhmadinejad offered his own definition of change. \"Change means giving up support for the rootless, uncivilized, fabricated, murdering... Zionists and let the Palestinian nation decide its own destiny,\" he was quoted as saying. \"Change means putting an end to U.S. military presence in the world.\" He said Iran will be \"waiting patiently\" and carefully studying the new administration's actions to see if such change takes place. \nObama campaigned on a promise to introduce diplomacy into US-Iranian relations, but it remains to be seen if either side will be willing to engage in diplomacy. Other US officials seemed to reflect a more conciliatory tone towards Iran than the previous administration. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton said Tuesday that Iran has a \"clear opportunity\" to engage with the international community.\nUS ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice pledged \"direct\" support to Iran only if it halts its controversial nuclear program, which Iran insists is for peaceful energy purposes.\nEven if Ahmadinejad is willing to talk with the US, any decision on foreign relations will require the approval of Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran's Supreme Leader, who said in October that hatred of America runs deep in Iran. However, opposition politician Ebrahim Yazdi is somewhat optimistic regarding the prospect of diplomacy, believing better ties with the US are in Iran's economic and political interest. \"The political atmosphere in Iran is now ripe, is suitable for direct negotiation with the United States,\" he said."}

In a more realistic scenario, the report foresees a loss of 30 million jobs, with a global unemployment rate of 6.5%. The unemployment rate has increased in recent years, from 5.7% in 2007 to an estimated 6% in 2008.\nEven the report's most optimistic scenario for this year, a loss of 18 million jobs at an unemployment rate of 6.1%, is not much different than the ILO's October 2008 prediction of 20 million jobs lost this year due to the financial crisis. \nThe report warns that developing countries in South Asia and Subsaharan Africa will be harshly affected by the economic crisis. Although working poverty - defined as having daily wages of US$2 or less - is on an overall decline, these regions are still characterized by poor working conditions, low salaries, and an insecure job market. This will only worsen in 2009, according to the ILO.\n\"Taking into account that a wage and salary job in poor regions may still not ensure all the components of a decent job, it becomes understandable that only a minority of working people have a job that is well paid, respects their fundamental rights and ensures some security in case of job loss, personal or family illnesses, or other difficulties.\" The report says that by the end of 2008, nearly 53% of workers around the world could be in \"vulnerable employment\".\nIn terms of actual unemployment, however, developed countries are the ones most likely to be affected by the downturn, as they are more tied to the global financial system. The unemployment rate in the European Union and other developed economies increased by 0.7 percentage points in 2008, the largest increase of all regions. \"Globalization combined with rapid technological advances is another challenge for labour markets in the region,\" the ILO says. \"It is important for workers and employers to be ready and able to adjust quickly to change and to stiffer competition.\"\nStill, the unemployment rate of 6.4% in these developed countries is far less than in North Africa and the Middle East, which had unemployment rates of 10.3% and 9.4% respectively. East Asia had the lowest unemployment rate of the regions at 3.8%. \nThe report urged global economies to take cooperative measures, including working with the United Nations, in order to stem the economic crisis. It also asks governments to address the \"negative social consequences of globalization\" by placing on emphasis an social justice-based programs targeted toward women, youth, and other \"vulnerable groups\".\nIn particular, the ILO says governments should establish public infrastructure projects such as road construction, expand health insurance and unemployment benefits, and focus on the creation of green jobs when devising their stimulus plans. \"When governments design fiscal stimulus packages, it is important that they consider employment-related goals, including explicit employment growth targets,\" the report concluded.\n\"In the world, there remains a huge untapped labour potential, and economic growth and development could be much higher if everyone was given the chance of a decent job.\""}

She will remain interim prime minister until the general election, rescheduled for May.\nJ\u00f3hanna, 66, has support from both parties in the new coalition government, and she says she will accept the position under the condition that both parties will trust her. On January 27, it was announced that the nation's coalition government had collapsed and dissolved following a banking financial crisis. In October of 2008, Iceland's banking sector collapsed and was largely nationalised.\n\"Now we need a strong government that works with the people,\" said J\u00f3hanna during a press conference.

Iceland's deputy chief of mission at the Icelandic embassy in Washington, D.C. located in the United States, Olafur Sigurdsson, says that her homosexuality was never a problem with most other government officials.\n\"If she is gay, that is not an issue at all. We are very liberal in that sense. It has never been an issue for her as a politician,\" said Olafur.\nBefore entering the world of politics, J\u00f3hanna worked for Loftleidir Airlines as a flight attendant for about 10 years, before she got elected to parliament in 1978.

They are: Clodelio Iso, Rodelio Iso, Marlon Rodrin, Angelo Francisco and Gerardo Amparo. The fire was declared to be out at around 2:33 p.m. local time (UTC+8).\nMost of the explosion victims were employees of the Starmaker Fireworks Factory (SFF) located in Barangay Conchu, Trece Martires City. They were rushed to the General Emilio Aguinaldo Memorial Hospital, Korean-Philippines Friendship Hospital, Treceno Medical Pavillion and Mark Jem Hospital, and are still being treated for third-degree burns and cuts from glass shards, said Ryan Lucero, acting area manager of SFF factory and the Office of the Civil Defense-Regional Disaster Coordinating Center.\nRichard Rivera, SFF spokesman, said the firm meets \"global security standards.\" Founded in 1995, the firm pioneered synchronized music and pyrotechnics, which it also exported to other countries. SFF has promised to extend aid to the blast victims. \"The company is saddened over what happened,\" he said. The accidental fire sparked by the fireworks blast has spread to the nearby Yoshita corporation.\nSeveral houses and a church near the fireworks factory were also damaged by the powerful blast which created several craters inside the factory's compound. One crater measured at least 200 meters wide. \"It was really frightening. We scampered for safety because the ground was shaking and on fire. Then, body parts started flying around together with metal and wooden debris,\" said Juanito Salvatos, a gardener who was near the factory.\nAccording to Cavite police Superintendent Reynaldo Galam, the mutilated bodies of two men and a woman were recovered outside the SFF compound near a residential area in Trece Martires city. Jonathan Seramillo, Cavite NBI medico legal officer, said a commercial area, including the Cavite Provincial Capitol, suffered damages even both are one kilometer away from the explosion site, while 2 vehicles were also damaged.\n\"The 10:45 a.m. explosion inside the half hectare SFF pyrotechnics compound was so loud that it was heard as far as 500 meters away from the scene of the blast,\" said Galam. \"The explosion was so powerful that it broke window panes even at the municipal hall more than a kilometer away,\u201d said Mayor Melencio de Sagun Jr. The explosion has also caused part of the factory roof to land more than 1.5km (1 mile) away, and toppled concrete walls. \nSagun Jr. has cited reports that \"the incident stemmed from a test of fireworks that went awry,\" adding that the fireworks were to be delivered to the SM Mall of Asia in Pasay City. \"The one who tested it violated a rule barring testing inside the compound,\" he added, and explained that the factory is inside an industrial zone. The blast has also shattered the glass of two adjacent semi-conductor plants, injuring some of the employees.\n\"Shockwaves shattered windows and toppled concrete fences of nearby homes, knocking out electricity and raining down unexploded fireworks in the area,\" said Army Col. Romeo Ucag, who assisted in putting out the blaze, adding, \"he heard the explosion and saw a thick column of smoke from his post in Tanza, Cavite, six miles (10 kilometers) north of Trece Martires.\"\nAmid thick black smoke enveloping the fireworks factory three hours after the explosion, human body parts have scattered meters away from the fireworks factory. \"There are body parts scattered outside,\" said Galam, adding that \"police and health officials were trying to account for the estimated 100 staff.\" According to Senior Superintendent Hernando Zafra, director of the Cavite provincial police, \"they could not yet determine the cause of the explosion, which was heard by people three kilometers away from the site.\" \nAuthorities have also continued to sift through the rubble of the explosion. Zafra has said most of the victims could not be identified because their bodies have been dismembered and charred beyond recognition. Earlier, he has counted 43 people inside the factory being treated for injuries. Zafra has further noted that police arson investigators and National Bureau of Investigation officials are on the site to probe the cause of the explosion. Frederick Bragas of the OCD-RDCC 4-A said \"forensic experts are now determining the identities of the fatalities.\""}

Daylight Saving for South East Queensland (DS4SEQ) is one of these parties.\nDS4SEQ is a single issue party which, as its name suggests, advocates the implementation of daylight saving in South East Queensland. Currently Queensland runs on Australian Eastern Standard Time (UTC+10).\nQueensland's unicameral parliament is due for election in September, but may be held earlier. The election, like all Australian elections, must be held on a Saturday. The election campaign will run for a minimum of twenty six (26) days and a maximum of fifty six following the issue of the writs.\n\"Wikinews\" held an exclusive interview with the DS4SEQ. Answering on behalf of the party was leader Jason Furze.\nInterview.\nWhy do you want to form government?\nJason Furze: DS4SEQ would like to gain a sizeable percentage of the primary vote and win a number of seats. As we are a single issue party, voting for us will send a clear message to the major parties and that is: when it comes to the issue of daylight saving, the people of South East Queensland have ben \"[sic]\" ignored for too long, and a dual time zone arrangement must be implemented.\nWhat are the three main policies you will take into this election?\nJason Furze: DS4SEQ is a single issue political party, with the sole policy being: to have Daylight Saving Time introduced into the South East Queensland region, under a dual time zone arrangement aligned to Australian Eastern Daylight Time.\nDaylight Saving is a lifestyle and business choice and one that the majority of South East Queenslanders would like to have.\nWe acknowledge that there are many important issues facing the State of Queensland, however, DS4SEQ do not believe that this is a valid reason to ignore the majority voice who support daylight saving.\nHow will you address these policies?\nJason Furze: The dual time zone concept that DS4SEQ is proposing is a well thought out compromise to the current situation that obviously does not work. The dual time zone boundary is formed by the inclusion of 15 local council areas and provides a respectful view towards regional and rural Queenslanders, whilst also giving consideration to the view of the majority of residents in South East Queensland. This will allow regional and rural Queensland to continue to operate on Australian Eastern Standard time, whilst the South East Queensland region adopts Daylight Saving Time for 6 months of the year.\nIf you can't form government, who would you like to see do so?\nJason Furze: DS4SEQ do not offer an opinion of which Party may form the next State Government. However, what we would like to see, is for both major parties to change their thinking about Daylight Saving in Queensland, and seriously consider a dual time zone arrangement for 6 months of the year.\nWhat should Queenslanders keep in mind, when heading to the polls?\nJason Furze: Vote # 1 DS4SEQ and number 2 whicher [\"sic\"] party you would like to govern the state. Voting DS4SEQ number 1, will not be a wasted vote, because if the Party gains a sizeable percentage of the primary vote, winning a few seats along the way, this will allow us to convince the major parties to change their thinking on the issue of daylight saving.\nAs demonstrated by the 2007 Queensland Government research, about 70% of constituents within South East Queensland are in favour of daylight saving. State-wide, those who are against are now the minority, and mostly reside in the regional and rural districts outside of the DS4SEQ proposed daylight saving region. It has been 17 years since the people of Queensland have had a say on daylight saving, and in this time there has been a major shift in community attitudes demonstrating an increase in support.\n\"It's About Time!\" that the people of South East Queensland had a voice on this issue. South East Queensland we are your voice, and \"It's About Time!\""}

The FDA issued a recall on Wednesday on food items with peanut paste and other peanut products made after January 1, 2007 at a Peanut Corp. of America (PCA) center in Blakely, Georgia. The recall affects over 430 products containing peanut paste or peanut butter from the PCA plant.\nU.S. federal inspectors stated salmonella was found in 12 instances at the plant. So far the incident has been linked to eight deaths, with over 500 individuals sickened from the tainted products.\nU.S. Congressman Henry Waxman (D-CA) has announced he will hold a Congressional hearing February 11 before the House Energy and Commerce Committee to investigate the matter.

Scientists have known for several years that touching a solitary desert locust on the hind legs, or allowing it to see or smell other locusts, is enough to transform it into the gregarious phase. This week, Science magazine published strong scientific evidence that the behavioural and physical makeover is effected by serotonin, a carrier of nerve signals in virtually all animals.\nResearchers from the University of Sydney, University of Oxford, and University of Cambridge have pinpointed a single neurochemical - serotonin - as the cause of an instinctive behavioural change from the locusts' solitarious phase to become gregarious and form disastrous swarms of millions. \nSerotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, or 5-HT) is a monoamine neurotransmitter synthesized in serotonergic neurons in the central nervous system (CNS) and enterochromaffin cells in the gastrointestinal tract of animals including humans. Serotonin is also found in many mushrooms and plants, including fruits and vegetables.\nIn the central nervous system, serotonin plays an important role as a neurotransmitter in the modulation of anger, aggression, body temperature, mood, sleep, human sexuality, appetite, metabolism, as well as stimulating vomiting. Keeping serotonin levels high is the aim of many anti-depressant drugs. \"Serotonin profoundly influences how we humans behave and interact,\" said co-author Dr Swidbert Ott, from Cambridge University. \"So to find that the same chemical is what causes a normally shy, antisocial insect to gang up in huge groups is amazing,\" he explained.\nPrior to swarming, the locusts undergo a series of physical changes - their body colour darkens and their muscles grow stronger. The 'Phase change' is at the heart of the locust pest problem, for locusts are one of the world's most destructive insect pests, affecting the livelihoods of 1 in 10 people on the planet. \"To effectively control locust swarms, we must first understand exactly how it is that a single shy locust becomes a highly social animal that swarms,\" said University of Sydney Professor Steve Simpson who led the research for almost 20 years.\nThe 'phase change' was caused by stimulation of sensory hairs on the hind leg of locusts. Professor Simpson's team began to investigate the neurological and neurochemical basis of this effect. Dr Michael L. Anstey, of the University of Oxford, supervised by Professor Simpson, and Dr Stephen M. Rogers, part of Professor Malcolm Burrows' team at Cambridge, led the research investigating this novel field. \"Here we have a solitary and lonely creature, the desert locust. But just give them a little serotonin, and they go and join a gang,\" said Malcolm Burrows.\nOf 13 neurochemicals in locusts that were gregarious (swarming form) and solitarious (non-swarming), the only neurochemical that showed a relationship with social behaviour was serotonin. \"It was clear that as locusts switched from solitarious to gregarious, the amount of serotonin in their central nervous systems also increased,\" explained Professor Simpson. \"The next step was to determine if this relationship actually meant that serotonin was the cause of gregarious, and thus swarming, behaviour in locusts,\" he added.\nTo do this, the researchers either added serotonin or prevented the production of serotonin in locusts. The results show unequivocally that serotonin is responsible for the behavioural transformation of locusts from solitarious to gregarious. Serotonin was also found to be involved in social behaviour of species across the animal kingdom, including crustaceans, rats, and humans. \nThe team has found that swarm-mode locusts had approximately three times more serotonin in their thoracic ganglia, part of the central nervous system, than their calm, solitary peers. \"The question of how locusts transform their behaviour in this way has puzzled scientists for almost 90 years,\" said co-author Dr Michael L. Anstey, from Oxford University. \"We knew the [physical] stimuli that cause locusts' amazing Jekyll and Hyde-style transformation. But nobody had been able to identify the changes in the nervous system that turn antisocial locusts into monstrous swarms. Now we finally have the evidence to provide an answer,\" he added. \n\"The fact that serotonin causes the transition from a shy, antisocial animal into a party animal means that pharmacologically, gregarious locusts are on Ecstasy or Prozac,\" said Professor Simpson, who also explained that \"(whilst a very good idea, in reality) it would be difficult to create a locust control agent that interferes with serotonin.\"\nProfessor Simpson's team has significantly discovered that \"locusts offer an exemplar of the how to span molecules to ecosystems - one of the greatest challenges in modern science.\" He also offered an explanation on the problem of using a locust control agent: \"Because social behaviour in so many animals depends on serotonin, if we used unspecific serotonin antagonists in the environment, we run the risk of affecting other processes in locusts, as well as severely impacting animals other than locusts. We would need to be sure that locusts have a unique serotonin receptor that causes phase change, which we haven't identified yet. Any locust control agent would have to be specific for this serotonin receptor in locusts.\"\nThis study, which was sponsored by the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council of England, England's Royal Society, the Australian Research Council Federation, and the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada. The scientists that the conclusions of the study will provide a hint as to how to solve the problem of locust infestations, which affect China, Africa, and Australia. Dr. Rogers said the landmark discovery has opened a new area of study into ways of blocking specific serotonin receptors, \u201csomething that would allow us to break apart these swarms before they develop.\u201d\nCharles Valentine Riley, Norman Criddle, and Sir Boris Petrovich Uvarov were also involved in the understanding and destructive control of the locust. Research at Oxford University has earlier identified that swarming behaviour is a response to overcrowding. Increased tactile stimulation of the hind legs causes an increase in levels of serotonin. \nThis causes the locust to change color, eat much more, and breed much more easily. Green locusts turn bright yellow and gain large muscles. The transformation of the locust to the swarming variety is induced by several contacts per minute over a four-hour period. It is estimated that the largest swarms have covered hundreds of square miles and consisted of many billions of locusts.\n\"Locust\" is the swarming phase of short-horned grasshoppers of the family Acrididae. The origin and apparent extinction of certain species of locust\u2014some of which reached 6 inches (15 cm) in length\u2014are unclear. These are species that can breed rapidly under suitable conditions and subsequently become gregarious and migratory. They form bands as nymphs and swarms as adults \u2014 both of which can travel great distances, rapidly stripping fields and greatly damaging crops. Though there are about 8,000 currently known species of grasshoppers, only 12 form locust swarms. \nIn the history of the insect Desert locust (\"Schistocerca gregaria\") is probably the most important because of its wide distribution (North Africa, Middle East, and Indian subcontinent) and its ability to migrate widely. Adult Desert Locusts grow to between 2-2.5 inches in length, can weigh 0.05-0.07 oz, and are excellent fliers. In religious mythology, the eighth Plague of Egypt in the Bible and Torah, a swarm of locusts ate all the crops of Egypt. \"The gregarious phase is a strategy born of desperation and driven by hunger, and swarming is a response to find pastures new,\" Steve Rogers from Cambridge University emphasises.\nThe extinction of the Rocky Mountain locust (\"Melanoplus spretus\") in the late 19th century has been a source of puzzlement. Recent research suggests that the breeding grounds of this insect in the valleys of the Rocky Mountains came under sustained agricultural development during the large influx of gold miners, destroying the underground eggs of the locust. That species of locust had some of the largest recorded swarms.\nIn the 1915 locust plague, which lasted from March to October 1915, locusts stripped areas in and around Palestine of almost all vegetation. This invasion of awesome proportions seriously compromised the already-depleted food supply of the region and sharpened the misery of all Jerusalemites. The plague resulted in several increases to the price of food. On April 25, 1915, the New York Times described the price increases: \"Flour costs $15 a sack. Potatoes are six times the ordinary price. Sugar and petroleum are unprocurable and money has ceased to circulate.\"\nIn the 2004 locust outbreak, the largest infestation of Desert Locust happened in Western and Northern Africa, affected a number of countries in the fertile northern regions of Africa. These infestations covered hundreds of square miles and involve billions of vegetation-munching insects, which repeatedly devastated agriculture, and cost huge amounts of money to control.\nIn November, a locusts swarm 3.7 miles (6km) long devastated parts of Australia. Along the process of their active phases, these insects can eat their own bodyweight daily, and can fly swiftly, in swarms of billions covering 60 miles in five to eight hours in search of food. Researchers are now considering the development of sprays that convert swarming locusts back into solitary insects. \n\u201cWe hope that this greater understanding of the mechanisms causing such a big change in behaviour will help in the control of this pest, and more broadly help in understanding the widespread changes in behavioural traits of animals.\u201d Malcolm Burrows said. However, according to Paul Anthony Stevenson of Germany's University of Leipzig, the discovery will not likely to a short-term pest control solution. \n\"To be effective, antiserotonin-like chemicals would need to be applied when the animals are solitary locusts and scarce targets in vast expanses of desert -- about three locusts per 100 square meters (1,076 sq ft),\" Stevenson explained. \"Current serotonergic drugs are not designed for passing through the insect cuticle and sheath encasing the nervous system, nor are they insect-selective, hence their use is ecologically unjustifiable,\" he added."}

Staff have walked out at sites in Scotland, Wales and Teesside in north eastern England. The original strike was called over the awarding of a contract by refinery owners Total to an Italian company. This brought 300 Italian and Portuguese workers on to the site.\nThe latest reports say workers at the UK's main oil refinery at Grangemouth in Scotland have come out in sympathy, as have workers at the former ICI plant on Teesside in England and at the nearby Corus steel plant. Workers have walked out at a power station in Aberthaw in south Wales and at plants at Fidler's Ferry in Cheshire, at Lackenby in Teesside and at the gas terminals near Peterhead in Scotland and Milford Haven in Wales. A protest outside the Lindsey refinery has now dispersed but local union leaders say it will resume on Monday. The Lindsey strike continues.\nSecondary industrial action has been illegal in the United Kingdom since the 1980s. However, the penalties apply only to unions organising secondary strikes, not to workers acting individually."}

Robert Mugabe will remain as president, while Tsvangirai is set to be sworn in as prime minister on February 11. \nDespite the agreement, Tsvangirai and other MDC members expressed disappointment over the terms of the unity government. \"We are not saying that this is a solution to the Zimbabwe crisis,\" Tsvangirai told reporters. \"Instead, our participation signifies that we have chosen to continue the struggle for a democratic Zimbabwe in a new arena.\"\nAmong the MDC's concerns is the home affairs ministry, which oversees the police and security forces. Under the power sharing agreement, Mugabe and Tsvangirai will share control of this ministry, and the MDC says Mugabe could use that power to quell dissent as he had in the past.\nTsvangirai signed the agreement to take part in a unity government at a (SADC) summit in , South Africa. Opposition leaders had been pressing Mugabe to relinquish control of the home affairs ministry and release imprisoned political activists as part of the power sharing deal. But Tsvangirai's party said they were pressured into accepting the deal by the SADC, who refused to condemn Mugabe.\nKenyan Prime Minister called on the SADC to stop \"treating Mugabe with kid gloves\" at the in , Switzerland. \"We hold the view that SADC could do more in trying to help the people of Zimbabwe resolve the crisis,\" said Odinga. \"SADC should stand up and tell Mr. Mugabe enough is enough.

Earlier in March, Tsvangirai had garnered more votes than Mugabe in the general election, but the electoral commission said the opposition candidate did not receive a required majority of the votes. Tsvangirai then dropped out of the June runoff, claiming his supporters had been attacked and intimidated by state officials.\nRegional heads of government have been trying to since the election.

Proposition 8 advocates had argued that donors would be put at risk of harassment if their details were published. The state had already published a list of donors online but held back from disclosing \"late donors\" who had given money in the final few weeks of the campaign or after the vote had taken place.\nPro-Proposition 8 campaigners had said that a 1982 US Supreme Court ruling to protect narrow interest groups could apply to donors. State lawyers argued that the exemption could not apply to a large, well-funded and vocal campaign such as the one backing Proposition 8. If the Supreme Court's exemption was applied to this campaign, they argued, then it would effectively exempt most if not all campaigns from disclosure laws. Pro-Proposition 8 groups are still deciding whether to appeal to higher courts.\nCalifornian voters approved Proposition 8 on the same day as the general election in November, overturning an earlier state supreme court ruling that opened marriage up to same-sex partners statewide.
