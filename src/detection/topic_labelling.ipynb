This is proven in many real world implementations to reduce the abortion rate by upwards of in the first year and more as time passes.But the forced birthers arent supporting programs like that. In fact in Colorado where such a program existed funded for the first few years by private funds which ran out the forced birth faction actively campaigned AGAINST continuing the program with tax dollars.When I ask forced birth advocates about this they almost inevitably reply either that they dont believe their tax dollars should subsidize someone elses sex life or that they believe it is immoral to have sex outside marriage and that its certainly immoral for teenagers to have sex.The problem here and the reason why this leads me to think they dont really believe abortion is murder is that this means theyre prioritizing their own taxeconomic beliefs above saving babies or that theyre prioritizing their discomfort with people having sex in ways they dont like above saving babies.It isnt just that they have to prioritize its that they have prioritized. Perhaps not in a deliberate step by step conscious process but they have at least subconsciously prioritized their own tax or moral beliefs above killing babies.Im forced to conclude that either theyre monsters who but a monster would argue that their tax policy is worth murdering babies or that theyre not being honest about their belief that abortion is murder.If as they argue abortion is murder and that therefore it is worth sacrificing womens bodily autonomy to prevent it then surely it follows that if abortion is murder its worth them sacrificing a few tax dollars or a bit of squik on their part.',\n  'label': []},\n 't3_2e6v25': {'argument': 'Reference Article I dont buy into the idea that the president should never play golf or relax in any way.

On the contrary events such as the slaughter of the innocents the census of all the Empire are clearly fictitious and multiple miracles the triumphal entry to Jerusalem and multiple events surrounding the crucifixion are absent from all historical records when theres a reasonable chance that some account of them would have survived had they occurred at all.

Ive often seen assertions or articles that say feminism helps men too that theres no specific need for other organizations because feminism is actively working to tear down gender stereotypes.Anyway my general assertion is that feminism hasnt actually done anything significant to help men in general and as such there is often a need for other organizations to help.In general the only sorts of support offered have been very limited and contradictory support for LGBT types generally small scale limited for limited aid to black people in civil rights struggles things to aid women which feminists theorize may incidentally aid men things which were universally or widely supported and needed no support or things designed to harm some sort of group of men who they disapprove of. In general Im very suspicious of claims that vague aid will help men somehow. When feminists campaign to stop rape they dont just try to tear down stereotypes they do things like supporting buses to carry drunk women from bars back to their home so they dont get raped by their sketchy cousin who offered a lift.',\n  'label': []},\n 't3_5fmsn8': {'argument': 'Computers can already perform many tasks at superhuman levels e.g. arithmetic chess driving etc. and as long as the technology continues to progress we will soon reach a point where they can outperform us in every relevant field.

These increases in food production were made possible by a string of innovations and increases in productivity through technological and methodological advances in farming like crop rotation better plowing tools use of animal labour use of manure as fertilizer breeding of crops and livestock chemically produced fertilizers and pesticides and as of late genetic modification of crops.Today is the first time in recorded history that we deliberately use farming methods that decrease output under the moniker of organic food production. I believe that the desire for organic food production is a symptom of rich and saturated societies and is what we here know as a first world problem. This desire has the potential to compromise the global food output if it becomes more widespread and increase the number of people living in hunger and dying from starvation.I dont contest that chemically produced fertilizers and pesticides and GMO crops must be used carefully and in measured amounts to get the riskbenefit balance right and yes there are risks hazards and dangers associated with them. I dont contest either that early pesticides were rather poisonous and at times did more harm than good especially when used naively.However science and engineering progress all the time pesticides become better more specific fertilizers become better to handle cheaper and less energyintensive to produce GMO crops continue what breeding programs have done in the past that is improve a plant species for more and potentially healthier output with equal production cost.And thus I believe that organic food production is a dangerous fad and that to increase food output and eradicate hunger and malnutriton we must use and improve industrial farming methods using and improving all means available to us intelligently and wisely and without the prejudice of labelling something that came out of a chemical plant as bad while labelling something that came out of a cows arse as somehow magically good and instead have a sane costbenefit analysis that takes into account all that is availabe to us.Quite simply we must not throw away much of the food production techniques what served us well the last couple of hundred years because that could kill a large portion of humans alive today.Change my view.',\n  'label': 'Organic food'},\n {'id': 't3_4oh27m',\n  'argument': '.

If I cant know what the right thing is at any given moment its impossible for me to do it.Many of these laws are strict liability laws as well they dont require the same sort of proof that a murder law or similar does as to the criminal intent of the perpetrator but simply require a violation to have happened. Considering that some of these laws are things like the Lacey Act which makes it a federal crime to import export transport sell receive acquire or purchase in interstate or foreign commerce any fish or wildlife taken possessed transported or sold in violation of any law or regulation of any State or in violation of any foreign law Depending on the reading and Ive seen lawyers interpret it this way Any animal or plant that is illegal to own in any state or foreign country that you own is a violation of the Lacey Act. For each animal or plant that violates the statute can carry a prison sentence of up to years and up to a fine.I know about this only because I got interested in overcriminalization and Im still not sure if there is some foreign law where housecats are illegal.There are other things like the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act EDIT which is not strict liability but is overly broad in its scope compared to what it was originally intended to do and extremely harsh in its penalties which everyone on Reddit very well may be violating since we dont have written consent to access the server this is generally not enforced but see below and many other felonies that we commit daily.This is a problem because of the way the system works in practice if a DA really wants to smear someone they can just investigate records and tack on charge after charge after charge racking up dozens of regulatory offenses that pack some thousandyears worth of criminal sentencing theyll then offer a ridiculously low plea deal and so more and more often people are going to jail without ever seeing a courtroom because of the intimidation tactics used by prosecutors.I feel as though there needs to be some easier system of determining that the punishments a law prescribes are too severe for the crime it describes but I cant devise such a system on my own.',\n  'label': 'laws'},\n {'id': 't3_46bq7c',\n  'argument': 'My boyfriend and I got into a debate about whether aliens are flying around our galaxy and solar system and entering our planet.I argued that if there were aliens flying around in outer space even if theyre not entering Earth we would have heard about them from scientists.
