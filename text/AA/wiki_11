He has the experience and the intelligence and the vision to lead Canada into the 21st century,\" Mr. Belivacqua said at a news conference, Monday.\nBevilacqua is a six-term Liberal MP representing the riding of Vaughan, Ontario and was seen as a centrist on economic issues.\nHis departure leaves 10 candidates who will vie for the position at the Liberal leadership convention being held this December in Montreal.\nBevilacqua, 46, had had trouble raising money in the campaign and was thought to be trailing the other candidates. He fell behind the front-runners in the race in terms of raising money and wooing support from senior Liberals. He now becomes national co-chair of Rae's campaign as well as his economic advisor. \nRae is considered a front-runner in the race to succeed Paul Martin along with Michael Ignatieff, Gerard Kennedy and Stephane Dion. Rae, a former leader of the provincial New Democratic Party joined the Liberals in April after months of speculation about his possible candidacy. The winner of the December convention becomes Leader of the Official Opposition to Stephen Harper's Conservative government. "}

The mice, as a whole, were kept frozen in temperatures of -20 degrees celsius. \nScientists at the Institute of Physical and Chemical Research Bioresource Center which is located in Tsukuba, Japan, say that cryogenic techniques were not used and that the mice were kept in a freezer.\nScientists also say that the sperm was not alive when it was thawed out. At least one out of every five females that were injected with the sperm, gave birth to healthy offspring which are also fertile.\n\"Obviously, those frozen [sperm] were all dead in the conventional sense. Motionless sperm had no chance whatsoever of fertilising in vivo or in vitro. Nevertheless, some of these, if not all, were ... genomically intact, because they were able to produce apparently normal offspring,\" said the researchers.\nThe idea behind the experiment is that scientists say that the results now make it possible to bring back prehistoric animals or extinct animals such as the woolly mammoth, but because any fully intact body found would have been frozen for over 10,000 years and would likely be too damaged organisms and bacterias. Endangered species such as elephants could also be reproduced, but scientists also say that the chances of an experiment like that of being successful are still \"slim.\"\n\"Restoration of extinct species could be possible if male individuals are found in permafrost. If sperm of extinct mammalian species, for example the woolly mammoth, can be retrieved from animal bodies that were kept frozen for millions of years in permanent frost, live animals might be restored by injecting them into oocytes [eggs] from females of closely related species,\" said Dr. Narumi Ogonuki, head of the team who made the discovery."}

Harry Farr, whose family had appealed to the Defence Secretary to grant a full, posthumous pardon. The Ministry of Defence informed the family lawyers of the decision hours before making a public announcement. \nFarr's family members said in a statement that they were \"overwhelmed\".\nThe government proposes to pardon all those executed in World War I under the Army Act 1881 and the Indian Army Act 1911, for what are considered \"battlefield offences\", such as cowardice or desertion, which may have been influenced by the stress of the battle. The proposal involves several Commonwealth and former colonial countries whose troops also fought alongside British troops. Mr. Browne said that he intends to introduce a suitable amendment to the current Armed Forces Bill to request Parliament's approval.\nAnnouncing the plan, Mr. Browne said, \"I am conscious of how the families of these men feel today. They have had to endure a stigma for decades. [...] I believe it is appropriate to seek a statutory pardon.\"\nCampaign to clear soldiers' names.\nPte Farr's family have fought for 14 years to obtain a pardon, saying Farr's refusal to fight was a direct result of the mental stress caused by his experience in the trenches. They had argued that Pte. Farr was suffering from shell shock, he should have not been sent back to the trenches and that the court martial was unfair because it did not take shell shock into consideration. \nIn June 2004, Defence Secretary Geoff Hoon refused to grant a pardon to Pte Farr, but the family sought a judicial review. After a High Court ruled against a pardon, the family appealed to the Defence Secretary for a review of the case. In May 2005, a judge opined that there was \"room for argument\" that they had been wrongly refused a conditional posthumous pardon. A further hearing scheduled for October 2005 was delayed while Defence Secretary John Reid reconsidered the case. \nThe Ministry of Defence said in June that Mr. Reid, who had earlier sympathised with the cause, was prepared to look at Pte Farr's case in the wider context of the whole posthumous pardon issue. \nRelatives of many soldiers convicted of desertion or cowardice have been calling for pardons since 1990 when the Public Record Office declassified case documents. Campaigners claimed that most of the soldiers were suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder brought on by their experience of trench warfare and that they were unrepresented or defended by those with no legal training at trial, where relevant medical history, including mental health, was ignored.\nIn 1993, John Major rejected an appeal for a pardon, while John Reid, Armed Forces Minister in July 1998, refused a request for all executed soldiers to be pardoned. The government had always said it would consider each case on its own merits.\nAnnouncing the decision today, Mr. Browne said that he believed it was better to \"acknowledge that injustices were clearly done in some cases, even if we cannot say which - and to acknowledge that all these men were victims of war.\", adding that \"I do not want to second guess the decisions made by commanders in the field, who were doing their best to apply the rules and standards of the time.\"\nHe said that 90 years after the events, the evidence doesn't exist to assess cases individually. Speaking to BBC Radio 4, Mr. Browne said \"We can't be in a situation morally where we cannot redress injustices because we don't have paperwork in relation to an individual case. But we can in other cases where we have some paperwork.\"\nPrivate Harry Farr.\nPte. Harry Farr was from Kensington in London and enrolled in the West Yorkshire Regiment, serving in France for two years. He saw fighting at Neuve-Chappelle, where his battalion was shelled repeatedly. In May 1915, he collapsed with shell shock and was evacuated to Boulogne. He returned to see action in the Battle of Somme. In September 1916, he refused to 'go over the top'. \nHe appeared before a court martial, where he represented himself. Medical evidence presented at the court martial and found later showed that he was treated many times for being \"sick with nerves\" and \"shell shock\". He was found guilty of \"misbehaving before the enemy in such a manner as to show cowardice\", the decision was reached in 20 minutes.\nOn October 16, 1916 Pvt. Harris was shot dead by a firing squad, on the orders of his own officers. He was 25 years old.\nDeclassified army documents described him as a diligent soldier.\nAn Army chaplain who witnessed his execution wrote to his widow, Gertie Batstone \"A finer soldier never lived\" and that Pvt. Farr had refused to wear a blindfold during the execution, the \"Independent\" newspaper reported. \"The Times\" reports that nurses at the hospital where he was treated for severe shell shock said that he was unable to hold a pen in his trembling hand. \nAfter his execution, his military pension was stopped and Ms Batstone was forced out of their house, according to the \"Independent\". Pvt Farr's grave is unmarked and its whereabouts are not known.\nFamily \"owerwhelmed\".\nAfter being informed of the Secretary's decision, Farr's granddaughter Janet Booth told the BBC \"We don't know if it's a full or a conditional pardon yet. We are over the moon,\".\nPte Farr's daughter Gertrude Harris was seven days old when her father went to fight in France.

According to the proposed definition, \"A planet is a celestial body that (a) has sufficient mass for its self-gravity to overcome rigid body forces so that it assumes a hydrostatic equilibrium (nearly round) shape, and (b) is in orbit around a star, and is neither a star nor a satellite of a planet.\" Roughly speaking, the former includes objects over 5 x 1020 kilograms (1/12,000th of Earth's mass) and 800 kilometers in diameter, but all borderline cases would require confirmation by observation of their shape.\nAccording to this new definition, Ceres (an asteroid in the asteroid belt, between Mars and Jupiter), 2003UB313 (an astronomical object beyond Pluto which has previously been called the tenth planet), and Pluto's moon Charon may be dubbed planets. A dozen other candidates, like Sedna, Orcus, Quaoar, 2003 EL61 \"etc\"., along with the asteroids Vesta, Pallas and Hygiea are awaiting evaluation by the IAU.\nThe draft resolution also introduces the term \"pluton\", which refers to a growing subcategory of planets that have orbits around the sun that take at least 200 years to complete - effectively this will mean planets that orbit beyond Neptune. Plutons differ from classical planets: their orbit is highly tilted, eccentric and not circular, which suggests they have a different origin, the main reason why astronomers are interested in them.\nThe word \"planet\" comes from the ancient Greek word for \"wanderer\", because it was known in ancient times that certain lights in the sky moved in relation to other stars. However, since then no formal definition of the word planet was agreed upon. With the advent of powerful telescopes on the ground and in space, knowledge about heavenly bodies became more complex, stressing the need for unambiguous definitions. The issue came to a head in 2005 with the discovery of the trans-Neptunian object 2003UB313 (unofficially termed Xena by its discoverer, Michael E. Brown). 2003UB313 is a body larger than the smallest accepted planet, Pluto.\nThe suggested definition is not universally popular: some astronomers would like to draw the line at Neptune, and wouldn't classify icy dwarfs like Pluto as a planet, but as a trans-Neptunian object (similar to the plutons in the draft resolution) part of the Kuiper belt. Robin Catchpole, from the Institute of Astronomy, Cambridge, said in an interview: \"The public are very clear about what they understand by \"planets\". Those are the big, dominant bodies in the Solar System that we're all familiar with, the eight - or nine if you include Pluto. I think including more is going to add confusion to the public, but not really be particularly useful for astronomers.\"\nPluto is now being considered to be moved off the list of classical planets, but as the prototype of the new plutons category. The ninth planet (as it is termed, but maybe not for long), discovered in 1930, is a curiosity among planets for more than one reason: because Charon is so big in comparison, both are considered twin planets by some.\nThe current proposal is the result of two years work of the Planet Definition Committee of the IAU, which is responsible for the naming of astronomical objects. The 26th IAU General Assembly in Prague plans to vote on the proposal on Thursday, August 24 of 2006. When asked if he was confident the proposal would get the necessary two thirds of the votes, Professor Owen Gingerich, Chair of the IAU Planet Definition Committee, replied: \"I'm sure it will be controversial to those with a stake in some other solution, but I hope we will get an overwhelming endorsement.\""}

Light emitted by objects that lie on the far side of the galaxy was distorted by a gravitational force in excess of the distortion expected by the visible matter present in the galactic collision. To make their discovery, the scientists trained their telescopes on a cluster of galaxies officially designated 1E0657-56, informally known as the bullet cluster because of its shape. \nThe bullet shape is the result of the violent collision of a small galaxy cluster with another, larger cluster as normal matter in the galaxies interacts during the collision. Dark matter, however, does not experience any of the forces that affect normal matter, other than gravity, and ended up separating from the normal matter during the event.\nThese results will be published in an upcoming issue of Astrophysical Journal Letters."}

The company's Chief Executive, Sean McCarthy, said that they discovered the technology whilst working on generators for wind turbines used to power CCTV cameras.\nThe company has asked for 12 physicists to help them rigorously test their invention to prove, one way or the other, whether it works as they say it does. McCarthy claims that the vast majority of the scientists they've directly invited to test their device have refused, which is why they've resorted to the advertisement.\n\"Free energy\" is a perennial claim of con artists and inventors, one that science has constantly battled with. The idea that a small amount of energy can return a bigger amount without drawing it from somewhere breaks the basic laws of physics, specifically the laws of thermodynamics. One common claim of the free energy 'inventor' is that the scientific community, the government, etc. needs to publicly verify the machine works before the inventor will sell it. The logic of this is flawed, as the device would be an instant cash cow. The inventor would be able to power his home, car, and be able to sell the energy produced to others at the market price. Devices that are claimed to exhibit this behaviour are known as perpetual motion machines. The average person's knowledge of science (or lack thereof) is a popular weak point to exploit for con men.

He was found guilty in February of accepting cash and a plane ticket from an al-Qaeda agent in Pakistan. But was cleared of 'intentionally providing resources for al-Qaeda'. The former taxi driver was sentenced to five years in prison in March. \nThe Court of Appeal ruled Thomas's interview with Australian Federal Police (AFP) in Pakistan was inadmissible. Thomas appealed his conviction on the grounds that interviews conducted in Pakistan after his arrest in 2003 breached Australian law and should not have been allowed as evidence at his trial. \nHe was interviewed without access to a lawyer, having already been interrogated during two months in custody in Pakistan. Mr Thomas' lawyers argued that he was earlier threatened with torture from foreign security agencies.\nHis lawyer said Mr Thomas, who is married and has three children, accepted the money and plane ticket because he wanted to return home.

The group of 8 men, aged between 24 and 40, are being held in detention on Christmas Island by the Australian Federal Government. They will be sent to Nauru after identity interviews and medical checks are completed.\nAccording to \"The Age\" newspaper, the men are from a refugee camp on the Thai-Burmese border, and may be from the Karen tribe, who are battling Burma's brutal military Government. Karen rebels have been at war with the central Government for 57 years. \nAn Immigration department spokesman confirmed that the eight men claimed to be from Burma. Two of the men have contacted immigration lawyers, seeking assistance with asylum claims. David Manne, from Melbourne-based Refugee and Immigration Legal Centre, said the other six were likely to do the same. \"There's a very strong likelihood that they are genuine refugees,\" he said. \nThe men were first spotted by the Australian Customs Service at Ashmore Reef, 610km north of Broome, WA on August 13. They were sent by Navy vessel to Christmas Island - 2,400 km northwest of Perth, WA. The men have been held since Friday as part of the Howard Government's Pacific Solution to keep asylum seekers out of the country. \nIn 2005, the Department of Immigration began construction of an Immigration Reception and Processing Centre on Christmas Island, due for completion late in 2006. The facility is estimated to cost $210 million, and will contain 800 beds.\nNo Legal Recourse for Burmese.\nThe news of the boat people's arrival became public last week as Prime Minister John Howard scrapped controversial new migration laws. The proposed laws would have excised the Australian mainland for immigration purposes. \nAshmore Reef, already excised from Australia's migration zone, means the men have no legal entitlement to be brought to Australia for processing. They have no access to the Australian court system to argue their claims or contest the rulings of the Immigration Department.\nMr Manne said he was concerned that the circumstances of the men's confinement could hamper their attempts to communicate with lawyers. He said the Burmese men should be afforded the same rights as the West Papuans or Vietnamese asylum-seekers who recently made it to Australian shores. \"It's absolutely crucial these people be given a fair go, so that they can actually speak with us properly about the issues,\" he said. Mr Manne says he has made several requests of the Department of Immigration in Canberra.\n\"They're asylum seekers... they believe that they'd be persecuted if sent to Burma, and we have agreed to act on their behalf.\" He was unable to say whether the group was dropped off by people smugglers, as Immigration Minister Senator Amanda Vanstone claims. \n\"What we do know is they're seeking refugee status, that is, protection from brutal human rights abuse,\" he said. The Burmese regime has recently waged an aggressive attack on Karen insurgents - forcing thousands of villagers to hide in the jungle or seek refuge in Thailand. There are 140,000 refugees in seven camps along the Thai-Burma border.\nAustralian Greens Senator Kerry Nettle says the government must allow the Burmese group to be brought to Australia to process the asylum-seeker's claims. \"The government needs to ensure that all asylum seekers are offered legal support,\" she said. \"The best way to ensure the Burmese asylum seekers have full access to their lawyer is to bring them to Australia while their asylum claims are assessed.\"\nNauru.\nMeanwhile the near-bankrupt Nauru Government has urged Australia to \"speed up asylum seeker processing\" in their country. Nauru says Australia is taking far too long to process asylum seekers. Currently two refugees remain on Nauru - both Iraqi men. The men have been held in detention on the remote tiny island for five years.\nAccording to \"The Age\", the Nauru Government has approved a plan to impose financial penalties on Australia if asylum seekers are forced to languish on the near-bankrupt island. The report says if they have not been processed and either returned or resettled within three months, their visas will have to be renewed each month, with the cost increasing by $500 for each renewal.\nNauru's Foreign Minister David Adeang raised serious concerns about the mental state of the detainees. He says Muhammad Faisal's condition worsened sharply after he was re-interviewed by ASIO. Mr Adeang has asked for the Government to evacuate the Mr Faisal immediately, he says he is also concerned about the mental health of the other Iraqi man left on Nauru. The Australian Government claims advice from ASIO that the man may be a \"security threat.\"\nNauru is the world's smallest island nation, covering just 21 km\u00b2. Since 2001 it has accepted aid from the Australian government. In exchange for this aid, Nauru houses an 'offshore' detention centre for Australia."}

Report authors claim that the price of water could double or triple over the next two decades. The report, backed by the United Nations and farm research groups, shows that globally, water usage had increased by six times in the past 100 years and would double again by 2050 - driven mainly by irrigation and demands by agriculture.\nRecord oil prices and concerns about rapid onset climate change are driving more countries to produce biofuels - from sugarcane, corn or wood - as an alternative to fossil fuel. \"If people are growing biofuels and food it will put another new stress,\" says David Molden, who led the study at the Sri Lanka-based IWMI. \"The big solution is to find ways to grow more food with less water. Basically, more crop per drop,\" Molden said. \"The number one recommendation... is to look to improve rain-fed systems in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia.\"\nThe report says conquering hunger and coping with an estimated 3 billion more humans by 2050 will result in an 80 percent increase in water use for agriculture. Irrigation absorbs around 74 percent and is likely to surge by 2050.\n\"We will have to change business as usual in order to deal with growing scarcity,\" said Frank Rijsberman, director general of the IWMI, of the report released at the 2006 \"World Water Week\" conference in Stockholm. Solutions included helping poor countries to grow more food with available fresh water via simple, low-cost measures, a shift from past policies that favoured expensive dams or canals, the report said.\nAccording to Rijsberman, there are two types of shortages: those observed in regions where water is over-exploited, causing a lowering of groundwater levels and rivers to dry up; and those in countries lacking the technical and financial resources to capture water - despite its abundance. \nBillions of people in Asia and Africa already faced water shortages because of poor water management, he said. \"We will not run out of bottled water any time soon, but some countries have already run out of water to produce their own food,\" he said.\nThe report said that a calorie of food took roughly 1 litre of water to produce, with a kilo of grain needing only 500-4,000 litres compared to a kilo of industrially produced meat taking 10,000 litres.\n\"Without improvements in water productivity the consequences of this will be even more widespread water scarcity and rapidly increasing water prices.\" Rijsberman said water scarcity in Africa was caused by a lack of infrastructure to get the water to the people who needed it. \"The water is there, the rainfall is there, but the infrastructure isn't there,\" Rijsberman told reporters. \nOther recommendations for certain regions include the extension and the improvement of agriculture using rainwater, the introduction of cereal varieties that need less water as well as the development of irrigation systems.\nBut the priority, Rijsberman stresses, is to change mentalities and often outdated government policies. \"Government policies and their approach to water are probably the most urgent that need changing in the short term,\" he said. \nThere is, he says, enough land, water and human capacity to produce enough food for a growing population over the next 50 years, but one of the challenges is to provide enough water for agriculture without damaging the environment. \"Agriculture is driving water scarcity and water scarcity is driving environmental degradation and destruction,\" he said.\nIn Australia last week, Rijsberman said he would \"not be surprised to see the price of water double or triple over the next two decades.\""}

NASA has selected two American companies to launch rockets from the Woomera base. Rocket Plane Kistler and Space-X will conduct orbital flight tests and commercial operations. The Woomera site would also be used to launch cargo such as fuel and food to the ISS as often as every two weeks.\nWoomera, named for an Aboriginal spear-throwing tool, was originally involved in testing of long-range missiles and rockets for Britain during the Cold War. The site was also recently used by the Australian government to incarcerate asylum-seeking refugees.\nSpaceX based in California, and Rocketplane-Kistler of Oklahoma City, will share up to $US500 million in NASA seed money to develop their launch vehicles. NASA has stated it wants commercial firms to take over ISS transportation services after the space shuttle fleet is retired in 2010.\nSpaceX, owned by Internet entrepreneur and PayPal founder Elon Musk, made its launch debut in March with the Falcon 1 rocket but the vehicle failed shortly after lift-off. The two companies secured the NASA contract to demonstrate its \"commercial orbital transportation services\". Kistler has scheduled the first launch of its K-1 rocket from Woomera in late 2008.\nKistler said work on a $100 million launch site at Woomera was expected to start in October. The site should be completed by the end of next year. Kistler Woomera chairman Alan Evans said the contract meant \"hundreds of jobs\" would be created within the aerospace industry in South Australia. \"The jobs will be within the high-level end of the spectrum of the space industry, which is great news for the state,\" he said.\nK-1 will have crew transportation capabilities, meaning the Woomera site could see astronauts leave from Australia. The site may also be used to transport satellites into space for telecom companies and defence organisations. The K-1 launch vehicle is designed to be re-used 100 times. It is powered by liquid-propellant engines and lands back on Earth with the help of parachutes and airbags.\n\"Woomera was chosen because it can be used for polar and equatorial launches and because of its clean land areas,\" Mr Evans said. \"Kistler has already spent US$700 million developing this idea.\"\nRocketplane Kistler say their K-1 launch system will also provide low cost space access for satellites and research payloads. Their sub-orbital XP Spaceplane is 50% complete, and scheduled for first flight in late 2008. The K-1\u2019s hardware is 75% complete \u2014 and is scheduled for first flight in 2008."}

The award was handed out by King Juan Carlos of Spain and is accompanied by a C$15'000 (approximately US$13'400 or 10'400EUR) cash prize (less than the one million Euros that come with the Nobel prize). Nominees have to be under 40 years, because the founder of the award, Canadian mathematician John Charles Fields wanted the medal to be a stimulus for future endeavours.\nPerelman submitted two papers in 2002 and 2003 outlining a proof for Thurston's geometrization conjecture, which in turn, implies a proof for the Poincar\u00e9 conjecture. Other mathematicians filling in the details have found no flaws in Perelman's approach yet. In 2003, Perelman made a short tour in the United States to explain his proof of the conjecture. When he went back to the St Petersburg department of the Steklov Institute of Mathematics, he gave up his job, and is reported to be unemployed and living with his mother ever since.\n\"The reason Perelman gave me is that he feels isolated from the mathematical community and therefore has no wish to appear as one of its leaders.\" declared Manuel de Leon, chairman of the Congress, when asked about Grisha's motivation to decline. Prof. John Ball, retiring president of the International Mathematical Union, added: \"The reason centres on his feeling of isolation from the mathematical community.\" Perelman's friend Anatoly Vershik said the reclusive math genius just wanted to be declared correct, and regarded recognition as superficial.\nThe Poincar\u00e9 conjecture is widely considered one of the most important questions in topology (a branch of mathematics concerned with spatial properties preserved under deformation like stretching without tearing or gluing). It is one of the seven Millennium Prize Problems for which the Clay Mathematics Institute is offering a $1,000,000 prize for a correct solution.\nObservers speculate that he will also refuse this prize. In 1997, he also refused an award by the European Congress of Mathematicians, because he deemed the judges unable to understand his work. A spokesman for the Institute said it would decide on the prize in two years. Richard Hamilton's \"Ricci flow\" equation could also earn him a part of the prize, since it formed the basis for Perelman's papers.\nIn 1966, German Alexander Grothendieck refused his Fields Medal in Moscow out of protest against the presence of the Red Army in Eastern Europe. But later he accepted it.\nThe Poincar\u00e9 conjecture is not an easy thing to explain in plain English. A sphere as we know it is called a two-dimensional sphere in topology (because it's surface can be approximated by a two-dimensional plane). The four-dimensional analogue of such a 2-sphere is a 3-sphere (which is an example of a 3-manifold). \nNow imagine a ball and a donut made of rubber. If you throw a lasso around the ball and pull, you can squeeze it to a single point and slide off the lasso. But you can't do that with the noose through the hole of a donut, the only way is to cut through the donut. So in topology, there are basically two kinds of objects: objects with or without holes. By deforming objects without holes you can make them look like a sphere, but this is impossible for objects with holes. So basically, Grisha proved that in topology a ball and a banana are the same.\nThe Poincar\u00e9 conjecture surmises that if a closed three-dimensional manifold (our multiple-dimension banana) is sufficiently like a 3-sphere (a kind of hypersphere) in that each loop in the manifold can be tightened to a point, then it is really just a three-dimensional sphere."}

Sheridan successfully sued the newspaper last month, and was awarded \u00a3200,000 in damages. Eleven leading members of the SSP, including 3 MSPs supported the newspaper's allegations against him and testified against Sheridan in court. \nSheridan had intended to attempt to reclaim the leadership of the SSP but has instead decided to found a \"new party of the left\" leaving what he described as the \"colossal train wreck of the SSP\" which is divided between two factions, the pro-Sheridan \"SSP Majority\" and the anti-Sheridan \"United Left\". \nColin Fox, the current SSP leader, has urged Sheridan to abandon his plans. \"I disagree with Tommy that the SSP has 'reached its historical limits'. The SSP has huge potential still ahead of it. Hundreds of thousands of people wish to see it survive and thrive and take the socialist project which it uniquely promotes, still further forward...There is no basis for two socialist parties in Scotland with indistinguishable political programmes,\" said Fox in a statement.\nTwo major platforms within the SSP, the International Socialists (CWI) and the Socialist Worker Platform (IST) support Sheridan's call as does the SSP's South of Scotland regional committee. \nSheridan claims that several leading Scottish celebrities including actors and directors Peter Mullan, David McKay and Martin McCardie, support his call for a new party. \n\"I predict hundreds, maybe thousands, of ordinary, everyday workers will fight for equality and justice. The war is with inequality, not with fellow socialists. And Scotland is big enough for more than one socialist party, \" said Sheridan. \n\"The atmosphere a faction in the SSP has created is poisonous and unacceptable. It's obvious that those who are involved with the faction, which has hijacked the SSP and all its apparatus, have hatred for me as their motivating factor. The SSP have been bastardised, they're now a grotesque caricature of what we had hoped. It's time for them to fight among themselves. It's time to make a clean break. The new party will share some of the political ideology of the old SSP and the internal regime will be one of tolerance, friendship and genuine solidarity,\" said Sheridan in an interview with a Scottish newspaper. \nThe SSP executive has issued a statement declaring that Sheridan is \"on the road to oblivion\" accusing him of engaging in an \"act of political irresponsibility which can only delight the enemies of socialism in Scotland.\" The statement continues \"Tommy Sheridan has decided to run away from the SSP and wreak as much damage as he can in the process.\"\nSheridan replied to the statement saying \"I can't win either way. If I stay I am a problem according to my SSP colleagues who say they will not work with me again, but if I go I am splitting the socialist cause. Frankly, the SSP has been distorted by the faction which has hijacked its apparatus and the internal regime is now longer conducive to building a socialist party\". He added there is an \"unstoppable momentum building up\" for the creation of a new party.\nSheridan and his supporters plan to hold a meeting on September 3, 2006 to plan the new party. The SSP, meanwhile, will hold an event the day before to rally its support. \nThe SSP currently has six MSPs in the Scottish Parliament, two of whom, Sheridan and Rosemary Byrne are supporting the new party.

Despite attempts to destroy the group through repressions, it came to embody a broad social anti-communist movement within Poland. It is credited as one of many dissident movements which in the 1980s pressured reforms which eventually led to the dissolution of the Soviet Union and states in its sphere of influence. Solidarity eventually came to power in Poland with Walesa serving as President of Poland from 1990 to 1995."}

The Maharashtra Pollution Control Board had warned people not to drink the water, but despite this many people had collected it in bottles, even as plastic and rubbish had drifted by on the current.

Continuous rainfall over the preceding few days had caused a large pool of fresh water to accrue in an underground rock formation near to the coast, which then discharged into the sea as a large \"plume\" as fractures in the rocks widened. Because of the differences in density, the discharged fresh water floated on top of the salt water of the sea and spread along the coast. Over time, the two mixed to become normal sea water once more.\nA similar explanation for the phenomenon in Gujarat was given by Valsad District Collector D Rawal. According to him, the reason for the water tasting less salty than usual was that because of the monsoon, two rivers Auranga and Banki were in spate and had been flowing into the sea in the region."}

Local authorities report that a German tourist was found dead during his efforts to save his family in the coast. \nAccording to AFP reports, in the western point of the peninsula more than 260 firemen, along with troops of the Greek army and volunteers, are struggling to extinguish the fires that continue to burn. \nReferring to the fire on the Chalkidiki peninsula, president George Papandreou criticised the Greek government for what he called its inability to coordinate and promptly address the problem. The response from the Greek government to the major fire that broke out in northern Greece was not at all slow, the governmental spokesman told media on Tuesday. \nHowever, the fire in Kassandra, Chalkidiki has provoked criticism from most of the Greek media against the government, which is blamed for not being ready to tackle such a situation. MPs of the opposition announced to the media that they are ready to officially question the ability of the government to prevent such disasters in popular tourist destinations of Greece like Chalkidiki.

Israel already has three older nuclear weapons-capable Dolphin submarines but the new Dolphins have propulsion systems that allow them to remain submerged for longer periods of time, according to the \"Jerusalem Post\", making it harder for them to be tracked by satellite. Experts view the purchase as a clear signal to Iran that Israel can retaliate if subjected to a nuclear attack. \n\"The Iranians would be very foolish if they attacked Israel,\" said Paul Beaver, a British based defence analyst, speaking to the \"Washington Post\". According to Beaver, the submarines would provide Israel with both first strike and second strike capability.\nIsrael already has land-based nuclear-capable ballistic missiles in the form of the Jericho I and II missiles. \nGerman officials confirm that the contracts for the new submarines was signed July 6. The \"Jerusalem Post\" reports that they will be operational shortly. \nIsrael has never confirmed nor denied that it has nuclear weapons but is believed to have the world's sixth largest stockpile of the devices, with most outside estimates putting their stockpile in the low hundreds. Israel's possession of nuclear arms has often been a locus of bitter controversy in the Middle East, especially among countries who believe that the world community, and especially the United States, is hypocritical in its tolerance of Israeli nuclear arms while decrying the efforts of other Middle Eastern nations to develop their own nuclear capabilities.\nMeanwhile, the \"Jerusalem Post\" reports there is a growing mood among Israel's defence establishment that the country will have to act independently to stop Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons as the United States is unlikely to do so.\n\"America is stuck in Iraq and cannot go after Iran militarily right now,\" according to an unnamed official quoted by the paper. \nA report by the US House of Representatives' Intelligence Committee released on Wednesday asserts that if Iran arms itself with nuclear weapons, Israel would be pressed to respond militarily. \"A nuclear armed Iran would likely exacerbate regional tensions. Israel would find it hard to live with a nuclear armed Iran and could take military action against Iranian nuclear facilities,\" the report states. Iran has continually maintained that it seeks only to develop nuclear technology for the production of electrical power, though this has been disputed by many nations."}

We are currently exporting close to 150,000 barrels (a day), and next year we will double that,\" Chavez said.\n\"The oil issue is of utmost importance because we are diversifying the petroleum business.

He claimed that investment agreements with China will transfer technology to his country and help Venezuela escape dependency. "}

The 10-year old Afghan boy was riding on the back of a motorcycle when he and a teenaged driver sped to the scene of the attack, crossing a security perimeter that had been set up.\nThe boy's death has angered Afghans in the area and military officials are concerned of a backlash from the incident. \nThe casket of Corporal David Braun, 27, was flown from Kandahar in a C-130 Hercules aircraft.

The driver, 17, remains in serious but stable condition. \n\"We are very sad at what happened and we express our deep regret and condolences to the family and community,\" said Col. Arie Vermeij, deputy commander of ISAF's Regional Command South.\nResidents angry.\nThe father of the dead boy denounced Canada's military when approached by the Canadian Press for comment. Several women at the family home screamed, cried and shook their fists.\nMilitary officials fear a backlash in response to the boy's death. In the aftermath of the shooting, angry Kandahar residents expressed support for the suicide bombers and their opposition to foreign troops remaining on Afghan soil. \n\"They're very angry about that, the shopkeepers, the bakery man, all the people that are living in this place,\" said a Kandahar resident who works for a non-governmental agency and who was at the scene. \n\"They're angry and they get upset and they get out of patience, and they said, 'Yeah, we support the suicide (bombers)',\" he told the \"Toronto Star\".\nThe bomb, aimed at the Canadian patrol, killed 21 Afghan civilians and wounded 13.\n\"We support them and the international community should leave Afghanistan. We want to build our country by ourselves,\" he quoted other residents as saying.\n\"They have been telling me that they had better leave, all the ISAF, the security forces, the peacekeepers, they have to leave our country,\" he said. \"It's a very bad situation.

The Italian foreign ministry, though, said that three foreigners were missing. \nThe oil-rich Niger Delta region has witnessed a spate of kidnappings recently.

Bryant said he agreed with the suggestion from a panel of experts composed of court officials and members of news organizations. \"I think that our justice system is ready for its close-up,\" Bryant said in Toronto.\nBryant agreed Thursday, saying the compromise position would avoid sensational coverage of criminal trials often seen in the U.S.\n\"The panel looked at that and wanted to avoid the circus,\" said Bryant. \"There were great concerns about television cameras reporting in a fashion that would intimidate witnesses. Some witnesses (and some victims) might not come forward if they thought they would be on television.\"\n\"We're not talking about filming trials, we're talking about allowing cameras into the court to record legal argument,\" said Louise Botham, president of the Ontario Criminal Lawyer's Association.\nProceedings at the Supreme Court of Canada are broadcast on the Canadian Parliamentary Affairs Channel (CPAC) and provinces such as British Columbia, Nova Scotia and Manitoba, with prior permission of the court. In Newfoundland, cameras are allowed into a courtroom up to the time the judge enters."}

The Pakistan team subsequently refused to come out of the pavilion, resulting in their forfeiting the match to the home side. The issue soon snowballed and both the Pakistani captain Inzamam-ul-Haq and Hair came under criticism, the former for bringing the sport into disrepute and the umpire for his alleged bias against players from the Subcontinent.\nThe ICC's chief executive Malcolm Speed told a press conference that copies of Hair's letter had been forwarded to both Doug Cowie (the Council's umpire manager) and the Pakistan Cricket Board. The umpire asks, in his letter, for \"a one-off payment to compensate for the loss of future earnings and retainer payments over the next four years, which I believe would have been the best years I have to offer ICC and world umpiring.\" Speed, however, said that neither he nor David Richardson (the ICC's General Manager) believed that the episode was motivated by any \"dishonest, underhand or malicious intent.\" on Darrell's part. He also expressed surprise at the contents of the letter and that he felt the issue had been \"marked by a series of unfortunate and entirely avoidable overreactions.\". "}

The plant is part of the , which the Iranian government says is for peaceful purposes only in the face of accusations by western governments that the country is trying to develop nuclear weapons.\nThe Arak facility, located 150 miles south of , is part of a larger project of building a heavy-water in the city. The Iranian president has said that it will be used for medical purposes only, and has said that students, scientists, and journalists will be allowed to tour the plant. Construction on the production plant began in 1996. Iran provoked international controversy in April 2006 when it announced an earlier nuclear success: the of a small amount of to reactor-grade levels (3.5% of the isotope using technology. Concern was raised by some that if Iran was able to scale up its enrichment facilities, they could be used to produce bomb-grade uranium (90% uranium-235).\nHeavy water is the colloquial name for deuterium oxide, 2H2O. To the unaided eye it appears identical to regular water, H2O, but it contains , a heavy isotope of hydrogen. Among its many uses, it is commonly used as a moderator in certain types of nuclear reactors. It is considered a nuclear proliferation risk because heavy-water production reactors can easily use natural uranium, and in the process transmute it into the element , which can be reprocessed and used as the fissile core of a nuclear bomb. Heavy-water \"production\" reactors have been used for this purpose by India, Israel, Pakistan, North Korea, Russia and USA. There is no evidence that heavy-water \"power\" reactors, such as the Canadian-produced , have been used for military plutonium production, but in theory they can also be used for this purpose, as any uranium reactor will produce certain amounts of plutonium. \nCritics have charged that current Iranian research reactors do not require the amount of heavy water which the production facility will be able to create. Iran's other controversial reactor site at does not require heavy water. Though many of Iran's nuclear facilities do have possible peaceful uses, most of them are considered , which could also be diverted into military purposes. \nIn 2003, the still-developing production site was inspected by a delegation from the International Atomic Energy Agency, the non-proliferation wing of the United Nations in charge of enforcing the , of which Iran is a signatory. At the time, Iran claimed the heavy water would be for exporting to other countries, and later clarified that it would be used for a heavy-water reactor in Arak. Iran has claimed that it would have purchased a heavy-water research reactor from abroad but it had been unable to do so, and so had to resort to an indigenous design and construction. Iran claims that the reactor will be used to produce , which have many medical applications. IAEA inspectors questioned this on the basis that the reactor plans they had seen did not have adequate facilities for producing radioisotopes. Iran claimed that the plans were still developing and that the missing facilities, known as hot cells, could not yet be designed without knowing other characteristics of the reactor, and that they were building a separate facility with those capabilities at the same site.\nIran has insisted that under the terms of the 1968 treaty, it is guaranteed the right to develop nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. The IAEA has called upon Iran in the past to freeze production of the heavy-water reactor at Arak, but the Iranian government has refused and began construction on the 40MW reactor facility in 2004. It has been estimated that it will take five years to build, based on the previous experience of North Korea.\nNone of Iran's facilities currently have the ability to produce weapons-grade nuclear material, and most experts say it would be at least a decade for Iran to be able to build a functional nuclear weapon."}

The \"Associated Press\" reports that the government has asked the company to pay $450 million in taxes owed.\n\"From tomorrow, representatives of Chevron and Petronas must leave Chad and close their offices for not respecting their commitment in accordance with clauses relating to the payment of taxes on the companies,\" said Deby on Saturday.\nChevronTexaco, Petronas and ExxonMobil formed a consortium in 1988 to exploit oilfields in the Saharan region. On Wednesday, D\u00e9by had asked his government to renegotiate the 1988 contract signed with the consortium, under which Chad would get 12.5% of the wellhead-value of the oil produced, minus transportation costs and a \"quality discount\". D\u00e9by has also said that three ministers involved in making the deal would be removed and will appear before courts. \nD\u00e9by said that after 3 years of production, the consortium had earned a $5 billion return on a $3 billion investment, while the government of Chad has received $588-million as oil revenues. \nA source in the oil ministry said that the state owned Chad Hydrocarbons Company would be brought into the consortium. There is also speculation in the media that Chinese oil companies may enter the field, with Chad recently resuming diplomatic ties with China. \nChad was involved in a dispute over oil revenues earlier in the year. Last December, the Chad government relaxed laws it had earlier passed, which mandated that 80% of oil revenues must be spent on developmental works. The spending restrictions were demanded by the World Bank when it helped finance an oil pipeline linking oil fields in Chad to Atlantic ports. The World Bank responded to the change in laws by withholding payment of revenues. In June, an agreement was reached to spend 70% on developmental works. \nThe restrictions were meant to combat corruption and mismanagement in government spending - Chad was labeled the world's most corrupt state by a Transparency International survey last year.

Polehinke.\nThe early-morning Flight 5191 was operating as Delta Connection and was headed from Lexington's Blue Grass Airport to Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport. It crashed about a mile west of the airport at 6:07 a.m. Eastern Time. The plane was a Canadair Regional Jet CRJ-100.\nPolehinke was taken to the University of Kentucky's Chandler Medical Center, where he was listed in critical condition. According to the National Transportation Safety Board, the aircraft departed from a shorter runway than it was cleared to take off from.\nAccording to Gary Ginn, the Fayette County coroner, there was a significant fire on board the aircraft after impact, after which it continued to move forward several hundred yards before coming to a stop. The aircraft, however, is largely intact, Ginn said, and most of the passengers remained inside the cabin. Ginn said he expects the cause of death to be fire for the majority of the victims. The tail number has been confirmed as N431CA.\nBased on information recovered from the flight's data recorder and physical evidence on the scene, the National Transportation Safety Board is focusing on the theory that the pilot attempted to take off from a 3,500-foot or 1067-meter runway that is not certified for airline traffic. That runway is only for general aviation aircraft.\nInvestigators believe the plane did not get enough speed to lift off the ground before running out of runway. Air traffic controllers in the tower had cleared the flight for takeoff from an adjacent 7,000-foot or 2135-meter runway used for commercial airlines.\nLocal police and fire fighters responded to the scene within minutes, and it has been reported that two off-duty police officers helped pull Polehinke from the cockpit of the burning jet.\nLaura Brown, a spokeswoman for the Federal Aviation Administration told CNN that there is no indication that terrorism was involved in connection with the crash.\nFamily members and friends who suspected that their loved ones may have been on Flight 5191 began arriving at Blue Grass Airport shortly after the crash. They have been taken to a local hotel, where staff from Comair as well as airport officials are caring for them and providing them with information. Comair has also set up a hotline where family and friends can receive information: the number is 1-800-801-0088.\nAmong the dead were Jon Hooker and Scarlett Parsley, who had married just the night before and were off to their honeymoon.\nA moment of silence was held for the crash victims before the Los Angeles Dodgers-Arizona Diamondbacks baseball game in Phoenix, where Brandon Webb, a former University of Kentucky baseball teammate of Hooker, is a pitcher. Another passenger, Charles Lykins of Naples, Fla., wanted an early flight so he could get home to his two young children after visiting friends and family in the Lexington area, said Paul Richardson of Winchester. Mike Finley, 52, who lived in Corbin and owned the Finley Fun Centers, was headed to Reno, Nev., for a rollerskating convention, said his son, David Taylor. \"I'd say there's thousands of kids who grew up with our father,\" he said.\nRick Queen, who works for Turfway Realty in Lexington, said his father-in-law, Les Morris, was on the flight. Queen and Taylor were both frustrated with how Comair handled the families. \"I just felt Delta ran families around this morning for three hours. I finally got some help from a Lexington firefighter,\" Taylor said.\nFlight attendant Kelly Heyer was single and lived in the Cincinnati area. He had been working for the airline since 2004 and was recently appointed base representative for the flight attendant union said Tracy Riley, a union secretary and fellow Comair flight attendant. \"He was a standup individual,\" Riley said. \"He was very professional, loved the job.\"\nBornhorst described his own reaction as \"complete devastation\" and he lamented the frustration of the families as they awaited word. \"When tragedies like this happen, information can just not be relayed fast enough and I certainly understand the frustrations related to that,\" Bornhorst said."}

Analyisis of how proteins fold (specifically how the folding goes wrong) can give insights into how diseases form. The simulation processes used in the research take months just for a single protein so the data is split into small packets (called workunits by the community) and distributed to volunteers around the world. By downloading a program called a 'client' users can receive units and perform the simulations on them - results are then sent back to the Stanford servers.\nCurrently more than 150,000 computers run the folding 'client' worldwide. The new client can be downloaded to the users PlayStation 3 console and will then begin to calculate \"work units\" when users are not playing games. Since the PS3 has a 'Cell' processor with a total of 8 cores the calculations should be performed faster than on a PC. With this new program scientists aim to create a super computer faster than IBM's BlueGene/L System (which currently calculates more than 280.6 trillion bits of information per second). The new calculations are expected to process a thousand trillion bits of information across the whole project every second.\nA statement on Folding@home's website explained further: \"Using the Cell processor of the PS3, we should be able to do more folding than what one could do on a PC. Also, since the PS3 has a powerful GPU, the PS3 client will offer real time visualization for the first time.\"\nThe new program is part of an expansion of the project and the first of 2 new clients that have been developed. The second, scheduled for release later on, will utilise a computer's graphics card (supporting only ATI graphics cards at first) to perform folding calcualtions.\n\"We will release more details on all of this as the new software rolls out,\" said the statement, \"We are beta testing the ATI GPU client software internally at the moment and will likely announce an open beta in four to five weeks (end of September).\"\nThe Pande group noted their ultimate aim as being to create an even faster super computer, with the ability to process over a million trillion bits of data every second: \"The PS3 client and GPU client are together part of our new broader goals to push Folding@Home to the next stage, reaching calculations on the petaflop to 10 petaflop scale.\"\nThe PS3 client is expected to be available at the end of September.

Badware refers to software applications that try to download additional software with very little or no explanation. StopBadware.org decided to investigate after their users have sent in complaints regarding the operation of the software.\nAccording to the \"open inquiry\" on StopBadware.org, the preliminary tests conclude that AOL 9.0 installs software and extensions without the consent of the user, requires users to take certain actions, and it doesn't completely uninstall itself. The page then warns readers not to use the AOL software unless they're prepared to handle the risks involved.\nThe report clarifies its charges; for example it lists \"RealPlayer, QuickTime, AOL You've Got Pictures Screensaver, Pure Networks Port Magic, and Viewpoint Media Player\" as the software that is installed without notification. Additionally, the AOL toolbar, a bookmark to AOL.com, as well as extra icons are added to Internet Explorer without consent. The report continues by noting that AOL coerces users into upgrading the software by a popup window that does not allow refusal, as well as automatically upgrades the software without allowing that option to be disabled.\nAOL spokesman Andrew Weinstein claims that these problems are going to be addressed in an upgrade available next month. In the meantime, Weinstein claims that the problems are not malicious. \"No one has done more to protect users from malware than AOL,\" Weinstein said.

The bridge, which carried the Capital Beltway across the Potomac River, was scheduled for destruction as part of a $2.4 billion project to replace the span. The bridge has caused traffic delays nearly every day since its opening in 1961. \nMr. Ruefly had won the honour of pushing the plunger in a contest to find the worst commuting experience; after a motoring accident he became stuck in a traffic jam. Mr. Ruefly (who leaves home at 5:00 a.m. every day to beat the traffic) had crashed into a stationary tractor-trailer on the bridge, leaving him with severely crushed hips. The ambulance sent to transport him to hospital was unable to make it through rush hour traffic and, as a result, Mr. Ruefly almost died.\nThe detonation of the six-lane drawbridge was originally planned to occur at 11:59 p.m. however it was delayed by over half an hour when spectators broke through security fences to get a better view, the bridge was finally brought down at around 12:35 a.m. There was a 20 second delay between the time of initiation and the actual detonation. It was reported that the plunger was not actually wired to the charges, and was only a ceremonial prop to signal the actual detonation by the engineering crews.\nThe demolition is part of a complete replacement of the former six-lane bridge with a twelve lane version comprised of two side-by-side drawbridges. Work started on the project as early as 1999 and the new north-bound bridge was opened on June 10 2006. This demolition is the first step in the next stage of the project; to replace the existing bridge with the southbound 'twin'.\nBoat traffic on the Potomac River and vehicle traffic on the new Wilson Bridge were halted during the detonation.

Identifying her victory over the miners as the key decider, Beckett said of Lady Thatcher: \n\"Today few people under 40 remember a time when trade unions were a real force in the land, when the public sector controlled large swathes of the economy, when local councils controlled education and other local services, when benefits were considered rights of citizenship,\"\nThatcher, the only woman to have become British Prime Minister, is recognised as one of the most significant British politicians in recent history and her policies have been met with both strong support and strong opposition.\nAttlee, the longest serving Labour party leader (at 20 years) and Prime Minister from 1945 to 1951, ranked highly due to his key role in major reforms in British politics and economy. He was responsible for the creation of the National Health Service (NHS) and for granting independence to India. In 2004 a poll of political academics (organised by MORI) Attlee was voted the most effective (non-wartime) British Prime Minister of the 20th century.\nThe current Prime Minister, Tony Blair ranked mid table; with a score of 3.

Interestingly, in the same poll Thatcher came 16th whilst Attlee did not feature.\nOf the twenty, only Neville Chamberlain and Sir Anthony Eden scored 0.

He was found to be carrying computers, 15 cell phones, disguises (3 wigs), and a total of more than $54,000 in cash with him in the vehicle.\nJeffs' red 2007 Cadillac Escalade was pulled over because the vehicle's temporary plates from Colorado were not visible. No weapons were found in the car or at the scene. Naomi Jeffs, one of Jeffs' wives, and Isaac Steve Jeffs, his brother, were both in the vehicle and detained for questioning. Both were released and not charged with any crime.\nWhen questioned separately, Warren Jeffs and his brother gave inconsistent responses when asked where they were going, Warren saying Denver, and his brother saying Utah. In addition, the officer responsible for the arrest, Eddie Duchover, stated that when initially pulling the car over, Jeffs would not make eye contact, and nervously ate a salad. The officer also cited Jeffs' throbbing carotid artery as an indication that he had done something big.\nJeffs, a recluse, was indicted last June on a sexual misconduct charge in Arizona; prosecutors allege he arranged marriages for under-age girls and older men. Reclusive for over a year, the FBI placed him on its 10 most wanted fugitives list. A $100,000 reward was offered for information leading to his capture. He now faces new charges of unlawful flight to avoid prosecution.\nIt is not yet clear where Jeffs will be tried, though currently he is being held in Clark County jail (Las Vegas) pending a court hearing for the latest charge. He may be extradited to Arizona to face the additional charges there.\nThe FLDS is a separatist movement that split off from the Mormon church more than a century ago due to the latter's changed views on polygamy. FLDS members (estimated at ten thousand) believe that a man must marry at least three times to enter heaven after death. The sect is based in Colorado City, Arizona and Hildale, Utah (although there are other compounds in other parts of America).\nJeffs became leader of the group in 2002 after the death of the former leader, his father Rulon Jeffs."}

The Iranian nation has chosen that based upon international regulations, it wants to use it and no one can stop it.\" Iran has until Thursday to comply with a U.N. Security Council demand to stop its program. If Iran does not comply by Thursday, the UN has left open the possibility of economic sanctions. Ahmadinejad says that he is willing to listen to negotiations related to changing Iran's nuclear program but that, \"...any kind of dialogue should be based upon the certain rights of the Iranian nation.\"\nWhile the rights of which Ahmadinejad speaks are not currently available for public viewing, Iranian academics point to the six issues in Iran's standard diplomatic policy.\nIran has consistently claimed that it is enriching uranium and building plutonium-producing reactors for solely peaceful purposes\u2014for the generation of electricity, the exporting of materials for other civilian nuclear industries, and the creation of medical radioisotopes\u2014while many western nations have accused the country of running a clandestine program. They have cited as evidence for this Iran's continual investment in which could be used for either civilian or military purposes, as well as alleging that Iran has not been forthright in disclosures of its nuclear developments.\nIran provoked international controversy in April 2006 when it announced an earlier nuclear success: the enrichment of a small amount of uranium to reactor-grade levels (3.5% of the isotope using technology. Concern was raised by some that if Iran was able to scale up its enrichment facilities to thousands of centrifuges, they could be used to produce bomb-grade uranium (90% uranium-235).\nIran has insisted that under the terms of the 1968 , of which it is a signatory, it is guaranteed the right to develop nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. None of Iran's facilities currently have the ability to produce weapons-grade nuclear material, and most experts say it would be at least a decade for Iran to be able to build a functional nuclear weapon."}

He said that the biggest hurdle faced by the UN is that it has to deal with a large number of issues at the same time. The United Nations with its \"impressive achievements and \"haunting failures has changed but needs to change further\" he said in an article in \"Newsweek International\". \nTharoor's proposal is concentrated on four areas- making democracy a priority; bolstering the ranks (of the United Nations); prioritising and streamlining; and healing wounds. He talked about the crisis in the Middle East, and the nuclear standoff between the U.N and countries like North Korea and Iran, referring to them as \"obvious and trying\". He also pointed out \"problems without passports\" such as climate change, narcotics smuggling and human rights violations. Tharoor, a leading candidate to succeed Kofi Annan, said that strengthening the capacities of both the UN and its member-states was the best way to deal with these problems.\nTharoor stated that further efforts were needed to promote democracy and good governance the world over. \"We now have a Democracy Fund to help us do that, financed not just by the rich West but by countries like India,\" he said. He also pointed out that the UN should try and stand up more for human rights by making sure the Human Rights Council did its job more effectively than the \"over-politicised\" Human Rights Commission it replaced. He said the UN should support the efforts bodies like NATO and the EU were making in their peacekeeping. Tharoor also spoke about the conflict in Iraq, saying \"And where the task, like enforcing peace in Iraq, is clearly beyond us (the UN), we should let wars be fought by warriors, not peacekeepers,\"\nIn reference to \"healing wounds\", he pointed out the danger of the Cold War divisions being replaced by a North-South divide at the UN \"The new secretary-general must urgently combat this. I would focus on building issue-based coalitions to deal with specific practical problems (things like management inefficiencies, procurement policies, information technology, outsourcing) that have little to do with ideological politics,\" he said.\nTharoor is currently the UN's Under Secretary-General for Communications and Public Information. He and South Korean Foreign Minister Ban Ki Moon are considered frontrunners in the race to succeed Annan, whose term ends at the end of the year.

Unconfirmed reports have already placed the count as high as 74. Fuel shortages are common in Iraq, even though the country is endowed with large reserves of petroleum. According to reports, locals cut holes in the unused pipeline to syphon fuel, igniting fumes inside the pipeline. Many of the survivors were left with severe injuries, often with burns over 75% of their bodies. The blast comes after fierce fighting yesterday in Diwaniya between Iraqi government forces and the local Mehdi Militia that claimed 40 lives. The Mehdi Militia are loyal to the cleric Moqtada Sadr. \nIn Baghdad, 20 people were found shot to death. Investigators said the victims had been bound, and showed signs of torture. The bodies were dumped behind a Shia mosque, heightening tensions between Iraq's cultural factions. As sectarian killings continue, the divide between the Shia and Sunnis is driven deeper. Armed groups now patrol neighbourhoods that at one time coexisted peacefully. The groups are often comprised of local militias, or simply by vigilantes bent on protecting their territory. In spite of the violence, some economy continues to survive. \"Shoula property prices have risen a lot, because it is protected by the Mehdi Army and is safe,\" said Ahmad Abdel Karim,a Shia police officer and member of the Mehdi Militia, \"Sunni families left on their own. No one threatened them. They left so that the bombs fall only on Shias. The Americans come here with the National Guard. They try to confiscate weapons from the Mehdi Army so that this area falls to the terrorists.\"\nOn Tuesday, two Shia militia members were killed by insurgents in the city of Baquba.\nOn the other side of the fence a small Sunni enclave exists, guarded by equally dedicated Sunni community members. \"My life is basically between the house and guarding the mosque. You can't go anywhere else. If you go down that street, it's almost guaranteed a car will stop, pick you up, and you'll disappear.\" - Mohamed Reyad, a former plumber. Reyad said that weapons were provided by his \"Sunni brothers\", which included a group of scholars.\nThe latest wave of violence comes as US and Iraqi government forces have intensified efforts to secure Baghdad against growing violence and division among Iraqis."}

This Friday 180 police officers, between Auckland and Wellington, will start trialling them for 12 months.\nPoliceman, Constable Mike Smith, who had the new taser trialled on him said, \"My whole body was completely incapacitated from my feet to my head. My legs felt like concrete. I wouldn't do it again.\"\nThe police will not carry the tasers with them everywhere but only to call outs where they can expect violent encounters.\nThe tasers will replace pepper spray, as it is more effective and the offender is able to recover quicker. Only the armed offenders squad carry guns.\nThe particular model the police will use is the X26 model. This model delivers 50,000 volts of electricity but counters this high voltage with a very low amperage of .0036 amps, police say that this is safe. The taser works by firing two metal spurs at the target and transmits a charge of five seconds which paralyses the victim long enough to get the offender in handcuffs. The taser has a range of six metres, and is able to penetrate through both skin and clothes.\nThe New Zealand Green Party and civil rights lawyers are protesting against the use of tasers, saying that \"It risks lives and could be misused.\"\nThe superintendent, John Rivers, said that a report that had been commissioned after Steve Wallace was fatally shot in 2001 said that tasers were \"A less lethal option.\"\nJohn Rivers said Tuesday, \"The use of tasers was in the interest of public safety. He said they give police more tactical options when dealing with violent offenders. Very [sic] person who is shot with a taser gun during the trial will receive an examination by a doctor afterwards. British research had found that of the 400 times police there had drawn the weapon at least 60 per cent have resulted with the police not firing the device.\" \nMost injuries were not caused by the taser itself but by the falling to the ground that is caused by the taser, according to an independent medical research group run by Peter Robinson. \"No coroner or medical officer has found a situation where the Taser was the cause of death,\" Robinson said."}

The activist Jarrar reported in his blog \"RaedInTheMiddle\" that he had checked-in his bags and was issued a boarding pass. After waiting near the gate to board his jetBlue airlines flight, and after having to gone through a secondary search, two officials approached him.\n\"People are feeling offended because of your t-shirt,\" Raed reported that one of the men said to him. The writings on the T-Shirt said in both Arabic and English: \"We will not be silent\". \nRaed asked why this has offended anyone, and insisted his right to freedom of expression was violated.\nAccording to Jarrar, one of the inspectors said, \"You can't wear a T-shirt with Arabic script and come to an airport. It is like wearing a t-shirt that reads 'I am a robber' and going to a bank\". The airport official, unable to read Arabic, was unyielding to protests by Jarrar that the English language version of the Arabic was accurate, and suggested he wear the shirt inside out. \n\"Many people called and complained about your t-shirt. Jetblue customers were calling before you reached the checkpoint, and customers called when you were waiting here in the boarding area\", Jarrar was told after he complained.\nOne employee from JetBlue offered to buy Jarrar a T-shirt to replace the one he was wearing, since the activist had none other after his bags were checked. Refusing at first, he agreed to wear one with \"New York\" written on it. \nThe officer on the scene commented that it need not have gone from one extreme to the other: wearing a T-Shirt with an Arabic peace slogan on it, to wearing one with 'New York'. There is no reason to hate New York if you are an Arab speaking peace activist, according to Jarrar.\n\"I feel very sad that my personal freedom was taken away like this. I grew up under authoritarian governments in the Middle East, and one of the reasons I chose to move to the U.S. was that I don't want an officer to make me change my t-shirt. I will pursue this incident today through a constitutional rights organization, and I am sure we will meet soon,\" Raed said.\nHe was issued another boarding pass, with a different seat at the back of the plane.\nJetBlue said it was investigating the incident but a spokeswoman said: \"We're not clear exactly what happened.\" The spokeswoman also said the airline does not forbid Arabic T-shirts, but that it does take into account the concerns of its passengers. \nThe American-Arab Anti-discrimination Committee said the US Transportation Department and the Transportation Security Administration were also investigating the incident after the committee lodged complaints on behalf of Jarrar. \n\"We Will Not Be Silent\" is a slogan adopted by opponents of the war in Iraq and other conflicts in the Middle East.\nIt is said to derive from the White Rose dissident group which opposed Nazi rule in Germany."}

The radical changes now mean relatives of organ donor card carriers will no longer be able to overturn their wishes. Under the current system 1 in 10 of all possible organ donations are stopped by the families of the deceased.\nThe new act (proposed in 2004) replaces the original Human Tissue Act 1961 and the Anatomy Act 1984. \nChris Rudge (MD of UK transplant) said, \"Many more people could receive a life-saving transplant with the donors' wishes being given priority.\" He indicated that the new legislation could mean 400 extra donors a year translating to 1,200 more transplant operations (an average of 3 organs are used per donor).\nThe changes, which apply to England, Wales and Northern Ireland, are the result of a series of recent scandals. The Isaacs Report, published 2003, was held after Elaine Issacs discovered (in 2000) her husbands brain was passed on to Manchester University for research after his post-mortem, the report concluded that ethical considerations had been sidelined and that the Human Tissues Act (in its then form) was not followed. A further scandal involved Alder Hey hospital, where it was discovered that children's organs were removed without permission over a period of 7 years.\nThe new laws extend beyond Organ donation also covering things like \"DNA theft\" (a new offence involving the taking and testing of genetic material without consent) or the illegal storage of human tissue (with the penalty of up to 3 years in jail).\nThe act will modify the operation of the Human Tissue Authority (HTA); a relatively new body which will regulate these new laws as well as issuing licenses to organisations and facilities who perform post-mortems or who test, store or display human materials. The HTA said they expected to hand out around 500 licenses. Licensing is required from the start of the act (September 1) although storage of human tissue for therapeutic use will not be licensed till April 2007.\nThe new laws mean consent must be given for any kind of storage or research to be carried out. Adrian McNeil (Chief executive) said, \"Consent is the underlying principle on which this act is based. This is an important milestone for the HTA, and for patients, the families and professionals.\" \nOther organisations welcomed the act, Professor Alex Markham of Cancer Research UK said that \"Cancer Research UK is hopeful that this new regulatory framework will give researchers the support they need to carry out their work.\"\nHowever some have criticised the changes, saying they are worried that researchers will not be able to cope with the additional administration and that tissue would be even harder to obtain for research."}

The pilot project has cost approximately \u00a3100 million as opposed to 5 times that amount estimated cost for adding a new lane.\nThe conversion involves building lightweight gantries across the motorways to control the use of the new 'lanes'. Sensors will detect when congestion is forming and inform a control centre. Digital signs on the gantries will then notify drivers they may use the hard shoulder. New refuge laybys, complete with emergency telephones, will also be built at 500 m intervals for broken down vehicles to stop. CCTV cameras will be added to the gantries to help spot stopped vehicles.\nWhilst the hard shoulder is in use, speed limits will be reduced to 50 miles per hour (80 km/h), a reduced speed is reported by the Times to improve journey times in busy periods as it deters lane hopping.\nThe Highways Agency, who are responsible for the new idea, said: \"We get a big increase in capacity for a fifth of the cost and there is no environmental penalty because we do not have to extend the land boundaries of the motorway. It's all about making best use of the available space.\"\nHowever there has been criticism of the scheme, with some saying that the loss of the hard shoulder will hinder emergency services - who use the hard shoulder to reach accidents on motorways. In 2005, ambulance bosses criticised drivers using the hard shoulder when paramedics were delayed in reaching an accident on the A127 in Essex. There are fears that accidents during busy period will be completely inaccessible once the hard shoulders are used in this way.\nThe AA Motoring Trust also expressed concerns, saying that the new scheme may confuse drivers and that a more consistent approach is needed (on other motorways the Highways agency is adding in the extra lanes)."}

The results have been published in this month's edition of the \"Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology\".\nTablets with grass pollen that dissolve quickly under the tongue may provide doctors with a better tool to fight the illness. The patient could take the pills at his own home, and after a while the symptoms may disappear completely and treatment can be ceased. Contrary to the current standard treatment, this therapy targets the immune system in such a way that it treats the cause and not just the symptoms.\n634 patients from 8 countries participated in the trial. Half received Grazax\u00ae tablets (a product of ALK-Abello, H\u00f8rsholm, Denmark), the other half placebo pills. The group receiving treatment showed fewer symptoms during hay fever season and consequently cut down on their medication use. Grazax\u00ae also caused few and tolerable side effects such as itching and swelling in the mouth.\nCombined with several earlier papers, these results provide a basis for ALK-Abello to apply for European approval of their drug. It has already been approved in Sweden, and the company will follow a Mutual Recognition Procedure hoping to get their product in European pharmacies by the end of 2006. The company will continue to fund further inquiries into Grazax\u00ae and will keep collaborating with scientists from several European countries.\nDuring hay fever season, patients develop a runny nose, swelling of the mucous membranes of the nose, sneezing and teary eyes, a condition doctors call allergic rhinoconjunctivitis. The condition seems to be increasingly frequent, with approximately 10% of the population suffering from grass pollen allergy. First-line treatment includes antihistaminics (like cetirizine or Zyrtec\u00ae/Zyrlex\u00ae) and steroid sprays, but results are often disappointing.\nLong term results have been demonstrated for weekly shots with pollen extracts (a procedure called desensitization), but too many visits to the doctor make the process troublesome. Also, the patient has to wait some time before leaving the doctor's office, due to the risk of developing a kind of shock state termed anaphylactic shock."}

However experts have warned that despite the promise more work is needed for this to become a viable cure.\nDr Stephen Rosenberg, who lead the research team, said \"It's important to emphasize this is a highly experimental treatment that's still in the course of development.\"\nThe team treated 17 terminal skin cancer patients with modified cells from their immune systems. The technique uses genetically modified white blood cells (more specifically T cells) to attack and kill the cancer cells. Of the 17 subjects only 2 were cured of the disease (an aggressive form of skin cancer called a melanoma which is usually fatal in advanced stages). Before the treatment, which lasted 18 months, the patients were only expected to live for up to 6 months. The remaining 15 patients were not affected by the treatment.\nOne of the successful patients was Mark Origer (53) from Wisconsin. He has been fighting cancer since first being diagnosed in 1999. After finding out about the new trial on the internet he applied and, after interviews, was accepted along with 16 other candidates. The treatment removed Origer's melanoma and also shrunk another tumor in his liver - to the extent it could be removed surgically. Doctors confirmed he was free of the disease last week, nearly 2 years after treatment began. A second man (39) was cleared of his cancer which had spread to the lungs, liver and lymph nodes. Cancer that progresses to the lymph nodes is usually untreatable and fatal.\nT cells can attack and destroy bacteria and other harmful cells like cancer cells. However cancer cells sometimes reduce the signals on their outer surface by which they are recognised, so the immune system cannot affect them. Gene therapy involves modifying some of a patients T cells to contain a new receptor. (Receptors are what enable the immune cell to identify harmful cells, like those corrupted by viruses. The new receptor is inserted with the use of a viral vector, \"i.e.\" a virus made safe to insert the receptor in the cell.\nIn the trial, T Cells were removed from each patient and modified in the laboratory. Patients underwent chemotherapy to kill most of their current immune system, which was replaced by the mutated cells. The modified cells successfully survived after injection into the body - making up 10% of the subject's T cell count during the first 2 months. The team is now looking for ways to enable the cells to survive longer and in greater numbers.\nExperts have called this a significant technical advance but warn that more patients need testing and the technique refining before any conclusive results can be drawn. Dr Edel O'Toole, consultant dermatologist and British Skin Foundation spokesman, said: \"I think that the success of this approach in two patients shows promise, however 15 patients did not respond to the treatment suggesting that further work is needed to optimise this approach for all patients, which could take many years.\"\nRosenberg now hopes to run a new trial with possibly stronger gene therapy treatments, he is currently awaiting FDA approval.\nGene therapy was much hyped after it's first successful application in so called \"bubble boys\" (patients with severe combined immunodeficiency). After follow-up, these trials were stopped when it was discovered that three of eleven patients in one trial had developed leukemia. "}

The increases are part of a program of reforms for the organisation, addressing its governance and its macroeconomic monitoring process. The proposals need final approval at the annual meeting scheduled later this month.\nSpeaking at a press briefing in Washington DC on August 31, Mr. de Rato spoke on the current state of the global economy and outlined the reforms, which include a two-phase reshaping of the quota shares - the proposed increases announced today followed by the development for a new formula to come up with increases for a broader range of members. \nGlobal economy.\nThe Director said that the global economy has been resilient in the past year, and that growth prospects are still very good. While growth in the United States is moderating, He said, Europe has been above \"most people's expectations\", Japan appeared to have \"put deflation behind it\", China and India showed strong growth and many other countries, including in sub-Saharan Africa, are enjoying a continuation of last year's strong growth.\nHe added that inflation risks were a concern, along with high oil prices that could adversely affect inflation and growth. He also noted the collapse of the Doha round of trade talks as a \"major setback\" and that global economic imbalances \"remain large\". He called for economies to adjust to high oil prices and governments to reassess policies on subsidies, more labour reforms and better social security nets.\nAsia: Current status and prospects.\nFocusing on Asia, Mr. de Rato said that the strong growth is undergoing some \"modest rebalancing\", with exports slowing in tune with global growth but domestic demand strengthening. He also said that the business environment in Asia needs to become more attractive with more efficient financial integration. \nIndia.\nIn line with the Indian central bank, the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) statement earlier this week that the outlook for inflation in the country is \"clouded\", Mr. de Rato said that some inflationary pressures were building. The RBI had forecast a 5 to 5.5% average inflation or the 2006-2007 fiscal year, in July. \nChina.\nMr. de Rato called for China to implement \"more forcefully\" its foreign exchange regime and \"let market forces\" determine the value of its currency, the Yuan, adding that it was in China's own interest to do so. The United States partly blames the weak value of China's Yuan for its huge trade deficit, which hit a record $805bn (\u00a3423bn) last year.\nInstitutional reforms.\nThe proposed two-year reform program, the Medium-Term Strategy, was initiated by members in April. The current proposal, backed by the United States and Canada, was approved by an 85 percent majority of the IMF's 24-member board. The proposal will now be presented for final approval at the fund's annual meeting in Singapore on 19-20 September.\nGovernance.\nThe change in the Fund quotas, which largely determine the voting powers of members is proposed to be a two-phase affair. The proposed ad-hoc quota increases for the four \"clearly under-represented\" countries, followed by a second round of adjustments for a broader range of members, based on a yet to be determined quota formula. Mr. de Rato said that the Board will ask the governors to \"enhance the voice of low-income members through an increase in basic votes\", adding that an effort is underway to increase resources for the offices of African Executive Directors. The quota increase for China, South Korea, Turkey and Mexico together come up to a 1.8% increase, board officials told Reuters.\nMr. de Rato said, \"relative quotas and voting shares of our members do not adequately reflect the greatly increased economic weight of major emerging market economies\" and, \"initial ad hoc increase will only correct about one third of the very heavy underrepresentation of quotas... Many other countries are underrepresented too. These four cases were accepted by the Board\"\nAn IMF member country's quota, the amount of money it contributes, is determined by the gross domestic product (GDP), account transactions, official reserves and other economic conditions. The quota also determines the voting stake in the IMF and is reviewed every five years. \nIn the new formula for determining quotas, the United States is lobbying for greater emphasis on GDP, with other factors such as exports and reserves counting for much less. The slower-growing European nations have resisted such a change. The ad-hoc increase of quota is also opposed by India.\nAfrican countries spoke out against the ad-hoc increase proposals, saying it would mean a delay in expanding the role of the poorer countries, many in Africa. They called for countries to block the proposal. The UK Chancellor, Gordon Brown has previously backed demands for greater African voice in the IMF. He currently chairs the IMF's international finance and monetary committee.\nEconomic monitoring and analysis.\nThe reform program also initiates the Multilateral Consultations, where IMF members will discuss policies to address regional or systemic issues. The first such consultation has began with China, the Eurozone countries, Japan, Saudi Arabia and the United States focusing on narrowing global current account imbalances. \nThe IMF director also spoke of the need to improve the quality of the Fund's economic analysis. In particular, he said that the assessment of whether exchange rates are in line with economic fundamentals, which is currently performed for industrial countries, needs to be extended to emerging economies. He called for proceeding with caution, though, pointing to the methodological difficulties and market sensitivities involved. \nHe also said that the fund was working on developing better crisis prevention financial instruments for emerging markets with robust fundamentals and that the Fund would \"continue to strengthen and focus our support for low income members\".\nThe IMF.\nThe 184-member IMF was established in the aftermath of the Second World War, with a mandate to ensure global economic stability by monitoring currency, trade and fiscal policies of countries and providing low-cost loans to countries in financial distress. \nThe United States, Japan, Britain, Germany, Russia and France have single seats on the IMF's 24-member governing executive board. Europe commands the largest representation, with eight seats, Asia has five, the Americas four, Middle east three and Africa has two. \nCritics have said that the IMF fails to represent the needs of most developing countries; Nobel laureate and former World Bank chief, Joseph Stiglitz has blamed policies prescribed by the IMF when it loaned funds to countries in crisis for deepening their economic problems."}

Homosexuality is described as being \"un-African\" and a \"disease\" in parts of Africa, often regarded as a \"Western\" import. Bartels continued \"Unnatural carnal knowledge is illegal under our criminal code. Homosexuality, lesbianism and bestiality are therefore offences under the laws of Ghana.\"\nAlthough Ghana law does not stop groups from meeting the government has actively discouraged the event: \"[The] Government would like to make it absolutely clear that it shall not permit the proposed conference anywhere in Ghana...\" \"...It's not illegal for them to meet and talk, but we in Ghana don't want to encourage it. They can go and do it elsewhere\" added Bartels.\nBBC reporter Kwaku Sakyi-Addo (based in the Ghanese capital Accra) said that it was difficult to establish who had organised the conference. He noted that the Gay and Lesbian community operates underground in Ghana because of the social stigma. It is believed that the meeting was to be at the Accra International Conference centre, Koforidua on Monday. Managers at the centre have denied the conference was due to take place there.\nA researcher at the South African-based gay and lesbian rights group, Wendy Landau, condemned the ban: \"It seems the government got wind of something. It goes along with all the things that have been happening in places like Cameroon and Nigeria. It's kind of the spirit of the times in Africa,\"\nThe Ghana public may be divided over the issue, whilst the Ghana News Agency reports many members of public and the clergy have spoke out in support of the ban, anonymous callers to radio phone-in programmes have called it an infringement of freedom of speech.\nIn recent times homosexuality has been regular news in African nations, earlier this year Cameroon newspapers launched an attack against \"deviants\" publishing the names of suspected homosexuals.\nSouth Africa, by comparison, has recently had a gay marriage bill approved by its cabinet to allow equal rights for homosexual couples; making it the first African nation to officially recognise gay and lesbian couples."}

The final score was a one-point victory, 21 to 20, ending the All Blacks' 15 game winning streak. For the Springboks, it ended a five-match losing streak. The All Blacks performed the controversial Kapo O Pango haka before the match. It was the final match for the All Blacks, who had already won the trophy two weeks ago. The final match of the series will take place at Ellis Park in Johannesburg next week, when the Springboks play Australia.\nThe first opportunity for points came in the 6th minute when New Zealand were penalised. South Africa opted to kick at goal, and even though there was some breeze at the ground, Andr\u00e9 Pretorius slotted it through the posts, giving South Africa a three point lead. However the All Blacks were able to even the scores in the 10th minute, with Dan Carter kicking a penalty goal after the Springboks were penalised for off-side near their line. Pretorius' boot was accurate once again, when he successfully kicked another penalty goal in the 17th minute, giving South Africa the lead once again, six points to three. The first try of the match was scored in the 20th minute, when Carter crossed the line and after converting his own try, the All Blacks led 10 to six. However the Springboks bounced back within minutes, with wing Bryan Habana intercepting a New Zealand pass, and racing down to score under the posts. Pretorius converted from in front, and South Africa were back in front, leading 13 to 10. The All Blacks were unable to level the scores in the 27th minute, with Carter missing a penalty goal. The All Blacks' were denied a try in the 37th minute when the television match official deemed one of the New Zealanders to have been an obstruction. Carter was able to level the scores on the stroke of half time with a penalty kick.\nPretorius attempted to put South Africa back in front, attempting two drop goals, though both missed. A line-out turnover soon led to Pedrie Wannenburg getting over the try line to score South Africa's second try. Pretorius' conversion was away to the left, however, South Africa were now leading 18 to 13, with over 20 minutes remaining in the game. Joe Rokocoko scored a try for the All Blacks in the 66th minute, and Carter converted the try from the touchline to give the All Blacks a 2 point lead, the score now 20-18 with 14 minutes remaining. Pretorius attempted another drop kick with nine minutes remaining, though it missed, and the All Blacks remained in front. The Springboks were back in front, by one point, 21 to 20, when Pretorius landed a penalty kick with two minutes remaining in the match. A New Zealand knock-on in the 79th minute led to a South African scrum. The scrum needed to be set a number of times, sending the clock into overtime.

Some Spanish sources expect these events to reopen the political debate on this issue.\nThe immigrants generally leave the African continent in overcrowded canoes, embarking on a dangerous boat trip. They try to reach the archipelago, which, being part of Spain, serves as an outpost for immigration into the European Union. Boats are often intercepted in Spanish territorial waters. On the shore, humanitarian organisations like the Red Cross are waiting to provide the first care to the travellers. On arrival, hypothermia, dehydration and minor injuries are the most common problems.\nThereafter, officials try to establish the immigrant's identity. Most of them have no legal grounds for immigration, but cannot be repatriated because they conceal their identity, or because they are less than 18 years old. In that case they are taken to a state Foreigner Internment Center, where they can be held up to 40 days. Since Spain lacks bilateral agreements with most countries around the Mediterranean Sea except Morocco, they cannot return the immigrants without negotiations. If they aren't arrested upon arrival, or when the procedure doesn't result in repatriation, they can freely enter Spain and the European Union."}

I mean it's children. It's difficult for everyone involved.\" \nWitness Cmdr. Will Knight said, \"The mother came running out with one child in her arms, screaming to the neighbors that there were other children inside.\" \nFire Department spokesman Larry Langford said that the children were found in the front room, huddled not far from where the fire started. He added that the fire broke out shortly after midnight.\nWitness Al Tillman, 32, said that he was visiting a friend when he heard the children cry for help. He ran up to the third floor, where he managed to grab a boy's arm and drag him out to the waiting paramedics. \nTillman said, \"I'm shaken up because the other children didn't make it. I only heard one child. I wish I could have saved the others.\" \nOne man said that he and several others tried to get into the building, but the intense heat forced them to turn around. \nLater, people held a blanket under one of the apartment's windows, asking them to jump down. Firefighters retrieved the children remaining by ladder.\nThe mother is hospitalized with three other children. The Court County's medical examiner indentified the children as Vanessa Ramirez, 14; Eric Ramirez, 12; Suzette Ramirez, 10; Idaly Ramirez, 6; Kevin Ramirez, 3; and Escarlet Ramos, 3. Escarlet Ramos has been listed as living at a different address, but details regarding this have not been revealed."}

The previous attacks at Turkish holiday resorts, which killed 3 people and injured over 100 (10 of them Britons), were also claimed by TAK. Many of the recent bombings have been aimed at tourists. In recent years Turkey has improved its foreign reputation as a safe country by promoting tourism, now the disruption to that industry places thousands of jobs (and millions of dollars in revenue) at risk.\nIn a separate incident, 7 Turkish soldiers were killed in a clash with PKK militants in the south east. The militants are reported to have launched an attack against the soliders in their army post on the Iraq-Turkey border. The Turkish government has warned that unless Kurdish separatist violence stops it will take action against PKK targets in Iraq, sending its own troops across the border. The threat was reiterated by the newly-inaugurated chief of Turkish defense forces General Yasar Buyukanit, who vowed to defeat Kurdish terrorism."}

The talks are expected to focus on the continuing militant activity on both sides of the border, with Taliban forces allegedly infiltrating into Afghanistan from across the border in Pakistan. \nEconomic cooperation and reconstruction in Afghanistan are also on the agenda. President Musharraf is scheduled to meet cabinet ministers and address parliamentarians tomorrow. His delegation includes ministers for foreign and religious affairs and the petroleum sector, and the head of Pakistan's intelligence agency.\n\"Frank discussions on the war on terror and expanding bilateral cooperation on regional issues,\" read a statement by President Karzai's office. \nPakistan foreign office spokeswoman Tasnim Aslam told AFP news agency that the Presidents \"will exchange views on bilateral relations, economic cooperation, reconstruction activities in Afghanistan and cooperation in the fight against terrorism,\" \n\"Afghanistan is expecting the Islamic Republic of Pakistan to take effective action against terrorism,\" Afghan Foreign Ministry spokesman Sultan Ahmad Baheen said.\nPakistan signs \"agreement\" with militants.\nPakistan signed a peace agreement with pro-Taliban militants in the region on the eve of the visit. The deal aims to end years of unrest in the border province. Under its terms the Pakistan military forces and militants will stop attacks on each other and the militants have agreed to disarm or expel foreign Al-Qaeda-linked fighters in the area. Pakistan has rejected criticism that the deal will allow pro-Taliban forces to operate freely in the area. \n\"Pakistan is committed to its policy on war on terror, and Osama caught anywhere in Pakistan would be brought to justice,\" army spokesman Maj. Gen. Shaukat Sultan told the \"Associated Press\".\nKarzai meets NATO chief.\nOn Wednesday, President Karzai met the NATO General Secretary in Kabul and signed an accord aimed at boosting security and development in the country. The NATO chief warned that \"some of the terrorists, the spoilers, think they can win in the south,\", adding \"They are wrong. Because they cannot win, they will not win, [...] That is why we are engaged in combat as well at this very moment.\"\nViolence continues.\nThe visit comes amidst an upsurge in violence in Afghanistan, with US forces saying that 60 militants were killed by artillery and air-strikes on Tuesday. Some 700 more are believed to be surrounded by soldiers in an operation in province. \nNATO and Afghan forces launched an operation in Khandahar's Panjwayi district last weekend, and NATO reports 250 militants as killed in the operations, though a Taliban commander has disputed the figure and there is no independent confirmation of the toll. Hundreds have been killed in continuing fighting between government and international security forces and insurgents in the last four months. \nAn estimated 1500 families have been displaced by the fighting in Khandahar. \nSuspected Taliban militants shot dead two muslim clerics in Lashkar Gah, capital of the Helmand province in the last two days and raided a district headquarters in the town of Arghandad in province.\nStrained relations.\nMusharraf last visited Afghanistan in 2002. Afghanistan has previously complained that Pakistan is not doing enough to combat Taliban insurgency in its side of the 2,250km (1,400-mile) mountainous border between the two countries. Earlier in the year, allegations by Afghanistan that Taliban and Al-Qaeda leaders were living in Pakistan were dismissed by Musharraf as \"nonsense\". In February, Afghanistan issued a list of 150 Taliban suspects it said were living in Pakistan. President Musharraf dismissed the information as \"old and outdated\", but President Karzai reiterated that the list was up-to-date. \nSome Al-Qaeda and Taliban leaders have been arrested in Pakistan, which has also stationed close to 80,000 troops along the Afghan borders. There is international pressure on Musharraf to deal with Islamist groups in Pakistan who are believed to assist Taliban forces. \n\"Pakistan has the potential to be the solution to the problems of Afghanistan,\" Afghan foreign ministry advisor Ali Muradian said.\n\"We hope that President Musharraf will open a new chapter in relations between Afghanistan and Pakistan.\"\nPakistan was closely associated with the Taliban's rise to power in the 90s one of only three nations that recognised the then Taliban government.\nOpinion divided over Pakistan's role.\nWhile state run dailies \"Kabul Times\" and \"Hewad\" expressed hope that two leaders will work together to improve security, The daily \"Cheragh\" said that while statements about restoring security can be expected from the meeting, \"as experience has shown\", previous pledges by Pakistan \"have not been fulfilled\". \n\"Kabul Times\" also said Afghanistan was grateful for Pakistan's help to thousands of Afghan refugees. \n\"The key concern is whether the agreement is going to lead to more insurgents going to and fro across the border or less,\" A diplomat told AFP, while another questioned Pakistan's peace deal with the militants."}

Blair responded by calling Watson \"disloyal, discourteous and wrong.\"\nWatson told BBC News he no longer believes it is in the best interests of the country for Blair to continue as prime minister. \nThe resignations come in spite of a report in \"The Sun\" newspaper quoting unnamed friends of the prime minister saying he would resign as Labour leader on May 31, 2007.

Speaking in a televised announcement, he said the CIA no longer held any prisoners and was disclosing information on the men's detention because the interrogation was complete. 14 of the men have been moved from CIA custody to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.\nKhalid Sheikh Mohammed, the alleged mastermind of the 9/11 attacks on the World Trade Center in New York, is thought to be among 14 suspects moved, including Ramzi Binalshibh and Abu Zubaydah.\nPresident Bush said that the CIA interrogations had been vital in tracking down and capturing further suspects; such as Mohammed. He denied that the men were tortured: \"The US does not torture. I have not authorised it and I will not.\" Despite the frank disclosure the President would not confirm exactly where the secret prisons had been located, although last year \"The Washington Post\" reported on the possible existence of detention centers in Eastern Europe causing deep concern in the EU. The European Parliament also protested against so called 'rendition' flights across Europe to transport prisoners to the secret centers.\nThe announcement comes a month after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the use of military commissions to try detainees was illegal. The president's proposal will help lay the groundwork for congressional legislation proposals, that if approved, would establish a legal basis for allowing military tribunal hearings of some prisoners held in the Cuban base. Mr Bush, speaking alongside family members of 9/11 victims, said it was now up to Congress to authorize the commissions so that, \"the men our intelligence officials believe orchestrated the deaths of nearly 3,000 Americans on September 11, 2001, can face justice.\" The new policy is more like a military tribunal than the previous proposals.\nThe president said he would submit the legislation today for consideration. It is reportedly causing controversy on Capitol Hill leaving Bush facing a potential rebellion from his own party, something he will be keen to avoid with his mid-term elections approaching. A spokesman for the Senate subcommittee that will consider the bill said there were \"some sticking points with the administration\" over the exact content.\nA major part of the bill marks a role reversal by the Pentagon; previously the administration had argued that many of the detainees were \"illegal combatants\" and so not subject to the Geneva convention. The military commissions will now cover all Guantanamo Bay suspects with the convention, which, among other things, expressly forbids the use of torture. The president said that the bill would also ensure that individual US soldiers could not be sued by detainees in US courts.\nThe announcements coincide with a renewed focus on terrorism by Bush's Republican administration and comes as the party faces a tough mid-term election later this year.\nThe president concluded that the interrogation program had helped to prevent terrorism in America: \"Were it not for this program, our intelligence community believes that al Qaeda and its allies would have succeeded in launching another attack against the American homeland. By giving us information about terrorist plans we could not get anywhere else, this program has saved innocent lives.\""}

Heyman, author of the article, says that just because a child is lactose intolerant, does not mean that they should avoid dairy altogether. Many lactose intolerant people can consume small amounts of dairy. \nHeyman says that dairy consumption is important, especially for children, because of its high calcium content. The calcium is, in turn, important for stengthening growing bones. \"If dairy products are eliminated,\" the article says, \"other dietary sources of calcium or calcium supplements need to be provided.\"\nLactose intolerance.\nLactose intolerance is a condition, present in the majority of human population above the age of infancy, due to which the body cannot tolerate lactose, a sugar present in milk and other dairy products. Lactose intolerance causes a range of unpleasant abdominal symptoms, including stomach cramps, bloating, flatulence and diarrhea. \nAs lactose intolerance is inherent, its prevalence varies by ethnic group. For example, while only 12% of American Caucasians have it, its prevalence is 75% among African Americans, 93% among Chinese, 60%-80% among Ashkenazi Jews,and 100% among American Indians. Many people do not realize that they have this condition simply because they have eaten dairy all their lives and view the symptoms of lactose intolerance as \"normal\". \nOpposing views.\nPhysicians Committee for Responsible Medicine (PCRM) has long stated that the risks of consuming dairy far outweigh the benefits. According to PRCM's fact sheet, called \"Parents' Guide to Building Better Bones\", there are many healthy ways of getting enough calcium and promoting bone health. Many foods contain calcium, not just dairy. Also, it is important to consider the amount of calcium absorbed, not just the amount of calcium present in a food. For example, more than three times as much calcium is absorbed from one serving of Total Plus cereal as from one serving of 2% milk. \nPCRM promotes a strictly vegetarian diet. Despite its name, it claims only 5 percent of its members as physicians. PCRM has also been accused of having links with animal rights \"extremists\", in particular Jerry Vlasak, a former PCRM spokesman who called for the murder of scientists who use animals in research.\nSupporting view.\nThe report in News-Medical.Net says that Ann Marie Krautheim, with the National Dairy Council, a dairy lobbying group, says \nThis last statement, however, that dairy products are superior to calcium-fortified foods, is not supported by the article in \"Pediatrics\"."}

It is expected that the service will be available to visitors in the United States by year's end.\nBands will be able to set whatever price they wish, as opposed to the flat rates of services like iTunes; an undisclosed percentage will go to MySpace/Snocap. Snocap claims they are attempting to keep costs as low as possible. Fans of the bands, called \"Friends\" on MySpace, will be able to add the \"storefront\" to their own profiles.\nMySpace claims to have three million music performers registered on its site. Many of these bands are unsigned or independent, and thus don't currently sell their tracks elsewhere.\nDownloaded MP3 files will be copy-protection free, which means users can keep copies on as many playing devices as they wish, unlike on most legal song download sites.\nThe feature will be powered by a company called Snocap.

The explosions appeared to have been caused by crude bombs and occurred between 1:45\u00a0PM and 1:49\u00a0PM (IST) on Friday afternoon. The blasts took place near the Noorani Mosque, when a Shab-e-Barat procession was passing through the market. Curfew has been imposed in the town, which itself has been cordoned off, to prevent communal tensions from escalating. Mobile networks in the city have been jammed.\nMaharashtra DCP P. S Pasricha, however, claimed that only one blast had occurred resulting in 5 fatalities. An MLA from the area later confirmed the occurrence of three explosions. Special Inspector-General of Nashik, P. K Jain, said that two state police companies and ten Rapid Action Force had been sent to Malegaon to control the situation. He also added that prior intelligence had been received about the possibility of such an attack. \nAn angry mob attacked the Superintendent of Police when his team tried to reach the blast site. Deputy Chief Minister of Maharashtra, R R Patil is headed to the town to assess the situation. The Union Home Secretary has asked the state authorities to speak to local leaders in Malegaon and ask them to help maintain the peace there. A high alert has been declared throughout the state and paramilitary forces are en route to control the situation in communally volatile areas. \nMalegaon, in the Nasik district of Maharashtra, is famous for its powerlooms, and one of the biggest cities in Northwest Maharashtra. It has a history of communal tensions between its majority Muslim population and their Hindu neighbours. The town witnessed riots in 1984 and then again in 1992 (in the aftermath of the Babri Masjid demolition) and, most recently, in 2001. \nThe blasts happened a day after a controversy over India's national song, the \"Vande Mataram\" heightened communal tensions. \nSuspects.\nThe police are investigating the incident and the \"Times of India\" newspaper suggests that either the Hindu Sangh Parivar organisation Bajrang Dal or the Kashmiri separatist group Lashkar eToiba may be responsible. The Bajrang Dal attacked the Mohammadi Masjid in Parbhani and mosques at Pona and Jalna earlier this year following a similar pattern. Lashkar-e-Toiba might want to create a communal divide between Hindus and Muslims. \nSources.\n "}

Many officials and watchdogs, however, have criticized the film for allegedly stretching and fabricating the truth. Samuel R. Berger, a national security adviser made a statement denouncing the film claiming the film \"flagrantly misrepresents my personal actions.\" Former secretary of state Madeleine Albright called one scene involving her \"false and defamatory,\" and former White House aide Bruce R. Lindsey said \"it is unconscionable to mislead the American public about one of the most horrendous tragedies our country has ever known.\" \nA flurry of on-line email campaigns, protesting the film and demanding it be corrected or not aired, has erupted. According to the liberal group Truemajority, \"It's not just that ABC's movie is slanted. Big parts of it are simply untrue. The producer himself even admitted to simply improvising a key scene which depicts the Clinton administration letting bin Laden go when they had him in their sights -- a complete fabrication. Last night, the movie's star, Harvey Keitel, said 'It turned out not all the facts were correct.'\"\nAccording to ABC's entertainment division, the film is a \"dramatization... not a documentary.\" However, several key scenes, which critics allege distort the September 11 commission's report on which the film is based, are being reworked, reshot, or pulled altogether, and ABC is reportedly \"mulling the idea of yanking the mini altogether.\" \nFor ABC, credibility, along with what is reported to be millions of dollars spent in advertising, is on the line. The film includes many noted actors, including Donnie Wahlberg, Patricia Heaton, and Harvey Keitel, who plays counterterrorism official John O'Neil. However, criticism has come from within as well. Many who worked on the film have spoken out, claiming the film's accuracy and objectivity is questionable. One writer, Cyrus Nowrasteh, in an interview with Los Angeles radio station KRLA-AM, claimed that moments had been improvised, and writer James Bamford claimed on MSNBC that an FBI agent working as a consultant on the film quit due to allegations of fabrication.\nAction committees from all across the political spectrum have made statements on the film, including liberal watchdog MoveOn.org, which, in a recent statement to its members, stated that \"ABC shouldn't have any role in the political exploitation of 9/11.\"\n\"This docudrama is designed to do just that,\" the statement continued. \"It's spreading a false message to millions of viewers across the country.\"\n\"No one has seen the final version of the film, because the editing process is not yet complete, so criticisms of film specifics are premature and irresponsible,\" said Disney, the company that owns ABC."}

Security measures had been tightened during the days prior to August the 7th, when Uribe initiated his second term in office. Four years before, during the inauguration ceremony of Uribe's first term in office, a number of handmade rockets were launched by FARC from houses in the city's center, causing minor material damage to the presidential palace and killing several people from a nearby neighborhood.\nOne of the incidents that have come under questioning happened on July 31, 2006 in the north of Bogot\u00e1, during which a truck-bomb killed a garbage collector and wounded ten soldiers who were driving past in a military truck. The Army's commander acknowledged on September 7 that two military officers are under investigation: \"The recent attack with a car bomb, in which ten soldiers were wounded and a citizen died, and which had been attributed to outlawed groups, as well as the alleged confiscation of several explosives during the last two months, apparently do not to correspond to reality. These deceptions may have been carried out by unscrupulous people, including two army officials\".\nIn addition to the case of the truck-bomb, doubts now surround a number of other related incidents, including the confiscation of several kilos of explosives, the discovery of a house-bomb and of three other car bombs in the latest weeks. In one of these cases, according to \"El Tiempo\", witnesses said that the same man that abandoned a taxi bomb in the south of the capital was the same man who claimed the cash rewards for the tip-off.\nOnly two military officers are currently under investigation. The \"Caracol Radio\" station reported that, according to other military sources, there could be as many as seven members of the institution involved in the events."}

XDR-TB is defined as resistance to three or more second line antibiotics for TB. The condition remains treatable with other types of medications, but those are less effective, costlier and toxic. If the afflicted persons can't be diagnosed timely and given proper treatment, they can die within a month. Of 53 patients who had this form of the lung infection in the study, 52 died, reports ABC News. \nDr. Tony Moll discovered the Extremely Drug Resistant Tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the South African region KwaZulu-Natal. In an interview, he said the new variant was \"very highly troubling and alarming because of the very high fatality rate.\" Some patients might have contracted the bug in the hospital, Dr. Moll thinks, and at least two were hospital health workers. In one year's time, an infected person may infect 10 to 15 close contacts. However, the percentage of XDR-TB in the entire group of people with tuberculosis still seems to be low; 6,000 of the total 330,000 people infected at any particular moment in South Africa.\nThe typical symptoms of TB (like prolonged coughing, fever, night sweats, weight loss and chest pain), and signs on X-ray are identical for XDR-TB. To ascertain the presence of this resistant form, a laboratory test on the patient's sputum is necessary, but these tests are often too expensive in the poor countries where TB is present. Also, these countries frequently have high HIV-rates too; 44 patient's in the study by Dr. Moll were seropositive. These patients are particularly vulnerable. Dr. Karin Weyer, director of the South African Medical Research Council's Unit for TB Research, cautioned that \"In a country with such high prevalence of HIV, the emergence of XDR-TB is a nightmare.\" Because TB is often a hallmark of AIDS, many people afraid of the social stigma don't seek medical attention.\nThese distressing findings urged a two-day meeting in Johannesburg to discuss the situation. Experts like Dr. Moll believe the new strain is also present in other provinces than Kwazulu-Natal. Conference organizers report cases in Mozambique and Botswana too. The World Health Organization has called for renewed efforts to combat the disease. Meanwhile, officials of the Health Ministry are suspected to be enforcing a media ban on the topics of AIDS and possibly TB.\nDuring the 1990s, multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB), defined as resistance to at least isoniazid and rifampin, emerged as a threat to TB control, both in the United States and worldwide."}

Four members of the Memon family, Yakub, Essa, Rubina and Yusuf, were found guilty of conspiring and abetting acts of terrorism and also having contacts with underworld don Dawood Ibrahim, and now face between 5 years and life in prison. The judge decided to acquit three other Memons, Suleiman, Hanifa and Raheen, giving them the benefit of the doubt. Yakub, younger brother of prime accused Ibrahim Mushtaq 'Tiger' Memon, was also convicted of possessing unauthorised arms. The rest of the accused, including Bollywood star Sanjay Dutt, will hear the judgements in their cases over a period of four weeks.\nAfter hearing the court's ruling against him, Yakub lost his temper, hurling abuses at the judge and accusing him of \"making terrorists out of innocents\". After the blasts, which killed over 250 people in 13 explosions across the city, the Memon family fled to Dubai, and then Pakistan. Except Tiger and his brother Ayub, however, the rest of them returned to India in 1994, and were arrested by the CBI. Since then, Yakub has been in custody and has, according to his lawyer Subhash Kanse, been undergoing treatment for depression."}

The experimental group, consisting of 30 people, drank one cup a day of a specially prepared drink containing mandarin orange juice and added carotenoids. The control group, consisting of 45 people, did not. After one year, none of the patients in the experimental group had any signs of liver cancer. In the control group, four people, or about nine percent of the group, had developed liver cancer. The researchers plan to continue the study for five more years.\nIn a second study, performed by researchers from the National Institute of Fruit Tree Science and headed by Minoru Sugiura, 1,073 people from the town of Mikkabi, Shizuoka were monitored. The townspeople are known for their high consumption of mandarin oranges. An analysis of certain chemical markers in the blood of these people revealed a lower risk of liver disease, arteriosclerosis, and insulin resistance. \nThe studies are being presented during a four-day symposium called \"Functional Foods and Health\", which is part of the 232nd national meeting of the American Chemical Society from September 10 to September 13, 2006. \"Functional foods\" is the name given to foods that can fight various diseases, including cancer and heart disease.

The creators of the voting machine say the research was unrealistic.\nEdward William Felten, a professor of computer sciences and public affairs at Princeton University, and two Princeton graduate students, Ariel Feldman and Alex Halderman, created a computer virus that they say could remain concealed in tests, \"steal\" votes, delete itself to go undetected and spread to other machines.\nThey used a Diebold AccuVote-TS which is a small computer with a touch screen. The latest version of the software used 128-bit data encryption, digitally signed memory card data, secure socket layer (SSL) data encryption for transmitting results and dynamic passwords.\nThey opened the drawer with a key, picked the lock or undid screws to open the compartment that allows them to change the memory card. They suppressed the beep created by the computer when it reboots by using headphones. They say the virus can spread by using the same memory card which when inserted into a different machine will infect the machine.\nThe researchers say they received the machine they tested on from someone who wants to keep their name anonymous.\n\"You have to be a good programmer \u2014 not a genius \u2014 to do this,\" Halderman said. \"I believe a good programmer could reproduce our virus without very much effort.\"\n\"Analysis of the machine...shows that it is vulnerable to extremely serious attacks,\" the report states. \"An attacker who gets physical access to a machine or its removable memory card for as little as a minute could install malicious code.\"\nDiebold Election Systems president Dave Byrd said that the research was done with security software that were two generations old.\n\"By any standard--academic or common sense--the study is unrealistic and inaccurate,\" he said in a statement.\n\"Normal security procedures were ignored. Numbered security tape, 18 enclosure screws and numbered security tags were destroyed or missing so that the researchers could get inside the unit. A virus was introduced to a machine that is never attached to a network.\"\n\"Every voter in every local jurisdiction that uses the AccuVote-TS should feel secure knowing that their vote will count on Election Day,\"\n\"That's what they were saying a few years ago,\" said Halderman. He said he would very much like to study Diebold's newer machines and software. \"We expect and fear, unfortunately, that if we were to examine the newer version of the software, we could find similar problems.\""}

Progressive Conservative Dave Hutcheon was third with 17% of the vote while Green Party leader Frank De Jong was fourth with 6%. \nThe by-election was an important one for the ruling Ontario Liberal Party as the province enters an election year. The Liberals held the riding until former MPP Gerard Kennedy resigned, earlier this year, to focus on his bid to win the leadership of the federal Liberal Party of Canada. In the 2003 provincial election he held the riding with a commanding 57% of the vote. \nSpeaking Thursday night, NDP leader Howard Hampton said \"There are no safe seats for the McGuinty government. People see us as a viable option.\"\nDespite having been considered one of the safest Liberal seats in the province the by-election campaign has gone badly for the Grits who have pulled out all the stops in the past week after internal polling showed them in danger of losing. On Monday, Ontario Premier Dalton McGuinty and eleven of members of his cabinet spent much of the day campaigning in the riding. The last seven days has also seen a series of aggressive accusations aimed at DiNovo, a United Church minister. The allegations, which were initially made on blogs and anonymous fliers have, in the past few days, been issued in official Liberal Party press releases and statements and accuse her of not being suited for sitting in the provincial legislature. They focused on her admitted drug use when she was a street kid in the 1960s and what a \"Toronto Star\" column called \"carefully edited excerpts from her sermons\". Liberal candidate Sylvia Watson, a Toronto City Councillor, issued a press release alleging that DiNovo described the media's treatment of murderer Karla Homolka to the \"persecution of Jesus Christ\". DiNovo, who has billed herself as the \"Radical Reverend\" responded by saying the comments were taken entirely out of context and threatened to sue Watson's campaign.\nToronto mayor David Miller issued a statement denouncing the Liberal tactics as a \"smear\" while the media has been generally critical of the Liberal attacks on DiNovo as has the Progressive Conservatives whose candidate, Dave Hutcheon accused the Liberals of trying to \"assassinate the character\" of DiNovo. Premier McGuinty responded to the negative reaction saying \"Look, it's a tough by-election for us.\"\nSome Liberals and some columnists have argued that the anti-DiNovo campaign is payback for the 2001 Beaches\u2014East York by-election in which the NDP suggested that a sex scene in a novel written by Liberal candidate Bob Hunter condoned pedophilia.\nGraham White, a political science professor at the University of Toronto, told the \"Globe and Mail\" that the tactics might hurt the Liberals. \"It just looks like really bad politics,\" he said. \"Even if this is enough to sway voters in the riding for the by-election, it seems to me the larger risk is very substanial.\"\nFinal vote count.\n220 POLLS OUT OF 220 \nCandidate-Political Affiliation-Votes-% \n\"source:Elections Ontario\""}

To correct its course, Dell has also announced in the past week:\nPlans to outsource more services as it expands around the world.\nDell intends to be less US-centric, and to build new plants in regions such as central Europe, Brazil, China and India. Under the Dell 2.0 roadmap, the company will also provide fewer services in-house.\nSpend $150m on improving customer satisfaction.\nDell said this week that customer satisfaction is something that it had not done perfectly in the past. \"We made a decision six to 12 months ago, because we weren't pleased with our internal and external satisfaction indices,\" said a Dell general manager. Dell has also reduced its supplier base, to 'reduce variability in component quality', according to CEO Kevin Rollins. The company will also focus on product design, another aspect that Dell has been accused of neglecting in the past. "}

But he claimed that BT Global Services is thriving as the fastest-growing division within BT. He said that the division was outperforming its closest rivals, T-Systems, Orange Enterprise and AT&amp;T Enterprise, which had all posted revenue declines for the most recent quarter. He said BT was fast becoming a familiar brand to businessmen in New York, Tokyo, Mumbai and Shanghai.\nHe disclosed a few revenue figures not revealed before. For the financial year ending March 2006, UK revenues rose just 2% to \u00a35.5bn, while overseas revenues shot up 48% to \u00a33.3bn. And of the \u00a38.8bn total revenue, \u00a31.6bn was captive work for its parent, while of the remaining \u00a37.2bn, 18% came from the UK government sector and 17% from financial services. BT said it still harbours ambitions to conquer America, despite the failure of the 'Concert' partnership with V in the 1990s.\nIn a separate story, BT announced it has chosen Chinese vendor ZTE to develop a dual-mode handset -- 3G and DAB-IP -- for launch by its BT Movio subsidiary next year. DAB-IP (in other words, IP over the DAB digital radio network) will enable BT Movio to broadcast four TV channels at acceptable quality to the handset.\n3G will enable video-on-demand, so that the users can specify what video clips or programmes they wish to watch. UK legislation specifies that no more than 30% of the DAB spectrum can be used for non-radio purposes, so BT is lobbying for more DAB spectrum to be released, to enable higher quality video and/or more TV channels."}

However, in reality, as the number of pages served becomes very large, it becomes more difficult to find sufficient advertising inventory to send with those pages.\nNo-one yet seems to be making big margins from social networking sites. The cost of operating these sites, it turns out, is sensitive to scale.

The treatment costs per person are in the range of $7340 annually. \nThe Hanger bill (seems he may not be interested in pushing it) would re-open the debate on whether castration, either performed surgically or chemically, is an effective measure for an offender to opt out of treatment. Hanger himself has suggested that he may drop the bill in favour of a much broader measure setting up programs for dangerous sex offenders, in which castration will be one of many options. \nThe Minnesota House voted overwhelming to approve a measure for longer prison sentences and chemical castration for sex offenders in April of last year. Governor Tim Pawlenty later signed the bill on June 2. \nCalifornia in 1996, and both Florida and Texas in 1997 passed measures allowing sex offenders to avoid judicial commitments by undergoing castration."}

Michigan, Oregon, New Mexico, New York, Indiana, Ohio, Wisconsin, Idaho, Connecticut, Kentucky and Utah all report human cases of the illness linked to the contaminated spinach. All individuals sickened by the outbreak have the same strain, \"E. coli\" O157:H7. Officials are currently investigating cases in Washington, Pennsylvania and California to determine if the new cases are linked to the current outbreak.\n\"Based on the current information, FDA advises that consumers not eat bagged fresh spinach at this time. Individuals who believe they may have experienced symptoms of illness after consuming bagged spinach are urged to contact their health care provider,\" said a statement on the Food and Drug Administration's website.\nHealth officials report that the symptoms from eating any contaminated spinach are kidney failure or Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome [HUS] which can occur easily in children and elderly people, bloody diarrhea, mild fever and in some cases death. At least 14 of the infected have suffered kidney failure.\n\"Given the severity of this illness and the seriousness of the outbreak, FDA believes that a warning to consumers is needed. We are working closely with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] and state and local agencies to determine the cause and scope of the problem,\" added the statement.\nConsumers are urged to throw out any fresh spinach they may have as washing it does not help, but officials say that cooking the spinach could kill the bacteria though officials still urge consumers to throw out all spinach.\n\"We are telling everyone to get rid of fresh bagged spinach right now. Don't assume anything is over,\" said Wisconsin Governor Jim Doyle. Wisconsin has seen the worst of the outbreak with one death reported and over 30 people infected.\n\"If you wash it, it is not going to get rid of it,\" said the Center for Food Safety and Nutrition director, Robert Brackett.\nHealth officials also say that they do not know what caused the contamination and do not know where the spinach originated from. Officials believe that the contamination was not \"deliberate.\"\n\"It is too early to say where the spinach has come from. This is an active investigation and we will provide more information as it becomes available. We have no evidence that this was deliberate,\" said a spokeswoman for the FDA, Laura Alvey.\n A company which produces natural foods in California is suspected to be the source of the illness. Natural Selection Foods LLC. located in San Juan Bautista, California has recalled all of their spinach voluntarily, including any food items containing the vegetable. Some of those infected with the illness have reported eating spinach which came from the company, but officials say that the outbreak may not be entirely isolated to just Natural Selection and that the investigation into the origin of the outbreak is still ongoing.\n\"We have temporarily stopped shipping spinach products, and have taken spinach out of our salads that contain them. Everyone at Earthbound Farm is terribly upset about these illnesses and death and their potential relationship to a product that is ordinarily a very healthy food choice. We are committed to producing exceptionally fresh and healthy produce. Quality and food safety continue to be our top priorities,\" said Natural Selections in a statement on its website. Natural Selections is operated by Earthbound Farm.\n\"It is possible that the recall and the information will extend beyond Natural Selection Foods and involve other brands and other companies, at other dates,\" said chief medical officer with the FDA's Center for Food Safety, Doctor David Acheson.\nNatural Selection sells many different brand names of spinach including Dole, Trader Joe's, Green Harvest, Ready Pac, Earthbound Farm, Rave Spinach and their own brand of spinach, Natural Selections.\nOfficials say that more cases are expected to be reported, but many individuals will recover from the illness within a week.\n\"E. coli\", on average, affects more than 75,000 people a year and can kill as many as 60."}

The report called current measures aimed at tackling childhood obesity \"fragmented and small-scale\". \nThe report was released by the Institute of Medicine, but including an explicit disclaimer that 'Any opinions, findings, conclusions, are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the views of the organization [Institute of Medicine, Robert Wood Johnson Foundation] that provided support for the project.'\nDr. Risa Lavizzo-Mourey, president of Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, the organization that funded the report, said \"if we do not reverse the epidemic of childhood obesity, millions of kids and our society will be robbed of a healthy and hopeful future\". The percentage of children who are overweight or obese has been increasing worldwide in recent years. Food Consumer reports that according to the World Health Organization (WHO), childhood overweight and obesity is a \"global pandemic\".\nAccording to an estimate based on the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), 34 percent of American children were overweight in 2003-2004, compared to 28 percent in 1999-2000. In 2002, 16 percent of American children and teens were obese. In 2004, the rate was 17 percent. The rate is expected to rise to 20 percent, according to the report.\nChildhood obesity increases risk of several chronic diseases, including diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, obstructive sleep apnea, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, heart disease, poor self-esteem, and a lower health-related quality of life. Type 2 diabetes is at an all-time high in American children. According to WHO, obesity also increases the risk of stroke and certain forms of cancer. \nWhile there is no single cause of childhood obesity, experts cite sedentary lifestyle, labor-saving technology, not eating enough fruits and vegetables, calorie-dense fast foods, and deceptive advertising as some of the main causes. A recent report by International Obesity Task Force has said that junk food manufacturers target children, for example, through Internet advertising, chat rooms, text messages, and \"advergames\" on websites.\nThe article also mentions the greater prevalence of obesity among two minority populations, African-Americans and Hispanic/Latino, but does not consider in its analysis of the increase in obesity the increase of these populations as a proportion of the United States population.\nAfrican-Americans and Hispanic/Latinos have a higher rates of obesity than White Americans, while Asian-Americans have a relatively low rate of obesity. Despite only representing one third of the U.S. population, African-Americans and Hispanic/Latinos represent about one half of the population growth."}

Bush and Vice-President Dick Cheney maintained since before the 2003 invasion of Iraq, that the Iraqi government had direct, operational links with al-Qaeda and was thus at least partially responsible for the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center buildings and the Pentagon.\nMore recently, during an August 21 presidential press conference, President Bush responded to questions by Ken Herman of \"Cox Newspapers\" concerning the sagging Bush poll numbers with:President Bush - ...I don't think you've ever heard me say, gosh, I'd better change positions because the polls say this or that. I've been here long enough to understand you cannot make good decisions if you're trying to chase a poll. And so the second part of your question is, look, I'm going to do what I think is right, and if people don't like me for it, that's just the way it is.\nKen Herman - Quick follow-up. A lot of the consequences you mentioned for pulling out [of Iraq] seem like maybe they never would have been there if we hadn't gone in. How do you square all of that?.\nPresident Bush - I square it because, imagine a world in which you had Saddam Hussein who had the capacity to make a weapon of mass destruction, who was paying suiciders to kill innocent life, who would -- who had relations with Zarqawi... terrorists attacked us and killed 3,000 of our citizens before we started the freedom agenda in the Middle East. \nKen Herman - What did Iraq have to do with that? \nPresident Bush - What did Iraq have to do with what?\nKen Herman - The attack on the World Trade Center?\nPresident Bush - Nothing, except for it's part of -- and nobody has ever suggested in this administration that Saddam Hussein ordered the attack.

I have suggested, however, that resentment and the lack of hope create the breeding grounds for terrorists who are willing to use suiciders to kill to achieve an objective. I have made that case...\n43% of Americans believe that Saddam Hussein was personally involved on the attacks of September 11th, 2001 according to Opinion Research Corporation for CNN."}

About one hundred riot police and two water-cannon trucks are securing the restricted grass area around the building, while protesters are chanting with demands for Mr. Gyurcs\u00e1ny to immediately step down and schedule a new election before the year ends. \nAccording to midnight news, about 50 young people are leading a march in the rural town of Zalaegerszeg with the intention to harangue more support for the protest and lead a crowd to Budapest.\nThe prime minister has appeared on a liberal controlled cable TV channel \"ATV\" and later on nationwide commercial television \"TV2\". He pledged not to resign. He said the taped disclosure was fine, as the country can now finally understand why their spring censoring of state fiscal information and their election promises were justified - according to him the victory of Christian conservative Fidesz party would have pushed the country into even deeper economic and social turmoil.\nAccording to a H\u00edr TV editorial, the current scandal and the resulting public protest bears a harrowing similarity to early events of the Hungarian revolution of 1956 when a group of university students started a street protest against the communist regime after hearing leaked excerpts of the Secret Speech made by Nikita Khruschev wherein he denounced his predecesor's (Josef Stalin) regime.

The provisional results give 48.1% of the vote to the four-party Alliance for Sweden and 46.2% to the government and its two supporting parties, which translates to a seven-seat majority in the 349-seat Riksdag, Sweden's parliament. A detailed summary of results can be found in the Wikipedia article on the election.\nAround 22.50 CET last night Moderate Party leader Fredrik Reinfeldt claimed victory at his party's election night vigil in Stockholm. Referring to the Moderates' renewal under his leadership, he said: \"We stood for election as the New Moderates. We have won as the New Moderates. We will also - together with our Alliance friends - govern as the New Moderates.\" Prime Minister G\u00f6ran Persson admitted defeat shortly afterwards at the Social Democratic Party's election night vigil: \"We have lost the election, but we are not a beaten party. We will fight back.\" He said however, that he \"would not lead the comeback\", and announced his resignation as Prime Minister but also that he would resign as party leader in March 2007, at the party conference convened to choose his successor. Mr Persson has announced that he will hand in his resignation at 16.00 CET today.\nThe Speaker of the Riksdag, who in Sweden is constitutionally responsible for proposing a new government to the Riksdag, is expected to officially ask Mr Reinfeldt to form a government tomorrow. The opposition Alliance for Sweden (composed of the Moderate Party, the Centre Party, the Liberal People's Party and the Christian Democrats) had already agreed a common programme and on Mr Reinfeldt as its prime ministerial candidate before the election.\nThe centre-right opposition has bounced back from a decisive defeat in the general election of 2002, when the Moderate Party's proposal of large tax cuts and disunity between the four parties led to the government increasing its majority. Commentators are agreed that the move of the Moderate Party towards the centre under its new leader Fredrik Reinfeldt and the agreements reached between the four parties of the centre-right on major policy areas were important in gaining victory. The Moderate Party in particular did well, achieving its best result since 1928 and making a gain of 10.9 percentage points, the biggest gain made by any party since 1914. In contrast, the Social Democrats had their worst result since 1914, with 35.2% of the vote.\nThe key issue in the election was employment. The opposition argued that more needed to be done to get people into work to support Sweden's generous welfare state, and proposed to cut income taxes on those with lower incomes and to cut payroll tax, especially for the private services sector and for companies hiring long-term unemployed. This was to be funded mainly by cutting unemployment benefit from 80% of previous income to 70% after 200 days and 65% after a further 300 days. The opposition also argued for more choice in the welfare system.\nThe government pointed to Sweden's impressive economic growth, good fiscal situation and low unemployment rate of around 6%. They also attacked the opposition for wanting to undermine the \"Swedish model\" and attacking those who were already most vulnerable by cutting unemployment benefit. The opposition countered by arguing that unemployment is higher than official statistics suggest because of the large numbers of people on long-term sick leave and in early retirement, as well as government employment schemes.\nSweden's new government will be presented to the Riksdag on 6 October, and will present its first budget on 16 October."}

The editor of \"Investigate\", Ian Wishart, stated that at no time has \"Investigate\" ever suggested Davis is gay.\nWishart said that he has \"Been targeting Mr Davis for months and has appealed for readers to send him details of his private life. [My] article makes no homosexual inferences and is merely an attempt to background Davis ahead of reports to follow.\" \n\"Investigate\" has been publishing a series of stories involving Davis about an alleged incident overseas. They were tipped off by New Zealand law enforcement. \"The picture is all about trying to find out more about the alleged incident. [I am] working through overseas sources to investigate the allegations. Regardless of what his investigation uncovers, the results will be published.\" Wishart also says there is more 'dirt' to come.\nClark has called it a \"pack of lies\" and labelled it as a smear campaign. \"I've been aware of a smear campaign circulating for many months. Actively circulated by National Party people. And I've had countless friends phone me about it. It's been assiduously spread through circles in business, the law, accountants \u2013 it's just come from all quarters.\"\nDr. Scott is a close friends of the couple and was, according to Clark, \"reasonably boisterous and drunk,\" when the situation occurred and Davis was \"a bit disgusted,\" when he was kissed. \"We have a particularly small group of very close friends . . . and Ian is right in there. He is one of our oldest friends as a couple. There is not a shred of truth to what Wishart says,\" said Clark.\n\"People just fall about themselves laughing when they see that was the great 'gay' allegation,\" Clark said.\nClark has partly blamed the Exclusive Brethren for the smear campaign as they were allegedly the ones who campaigned to unseat Labour and also allegations that they hired a private detective to follow Davis, the church has denied having any involvement. Clark has said \"the smear campaign against her husband had spread far too wide for it to be the work of the Brethren alone,\" so she also blames Brash.\n\"I think the National Party has stooped to new levels with his leadership. I think we're seeing the absolute desperation of, actually, the far Right in politics, which feels it has a right to rule, couldn't cope with losing three elections in a row and there's a desperation and nastiness about it and it will stoop to anything,\" Clark said.\nBrash said that he rejects and condemns the rumour-mongering and a spokesman said: \"he [Brash] nor any of his MPs were involved in spreading them [rumours]. National believes the private lives of politicians and their families should be just that \u2013 private.\"\nA source for the National Party said that people had phoned in with the rumour and National told them to \"go away.\"\nGerry Brownlee, Deputy leader of National, denies any National Party involvement. He said: \"Despite Don Brash coming under fire for admitting his marriage was in difficulties amid speculation he had an affair, National is not in a vengeful mode and rejects any such suggestion. The private lives of the families of MPs should be left out of the public eye.\"\nMedia experts are passing off \"Investigate\"'s story as poor journalism. Including the head of New Zealand Broadcasting School, Paul Norris. Norris said: \"The leader of a party has to expect their private life to impact on their leadership but in this case it seems Clark does not have a lot to answer to. The story has very little substance.\"\nClark has denied that a meeting between Brash to discuss toning down personal attacks will take place. But does say a meeting between party representatives could be arranged.\nClark has told the New Zealand Police that she believes that they have been followed by private detectives. The police are yet to confirm that they are investigating the claim as of Monday morning. Clark said that she has been \"told by a number of sources that private investigators have been hired to follow both herself and her husband, Professor Peter Davis.\""}

As of 18:00 UTC the leading theory at NASA is that something escaped from the shuttle's cargo bay during that jet firing sequence.

Also males born in the late 1910's would have had a three year higher life expectancy, without the impact of the two world wars as well. The new study is an international study of survival and mortality.\nThe study also reveals that a male born in the late 1870's would have had an average life span of 51-years-old and in the 1930's the average life span was 69-years-old. And in females the life expectancy is 75-years-old, previously 55-years-old.\nKim Dunstan, Statistics NZ demographer, said: \"The dramatic lifespan changes were attributed to many factors, including improved hygiene, sanitation, medicines and infectious disease control. Changes in lifestyle had also made an important difference.\"\nPeople born in the late 1870's had a 23% chance of not making it to see their 15th birthday, people born in the 1900's had a 15% chance, people born in the 1930's had a seven percent chance, people born in the 1960's had a three percent chance and those born around the 1990's had a one percent chance.\nMr Dunstan said: \"The study provided the most complete picture of how long New Zealanders lived and showed for the first time the impact of war deaths on the population. Death comes to us all and it does affect us at a lot of levels. A lot of people have had family members who died in the war and can relate to their own experiences.\"\n\"A History of Survival in New Zealand\" also shows that New Zealand is one of the few countries in the world that has an almost complete and detailed history of births, deaths and migration information dating back to the late 1800's. This study is a historic book full of births, deaths and external migration for the population of New Zealand. It will also be used in the future relating to health, population and mortality areas.

Mercury poisoning in humans, which can result from eating contaminated animals, leads to a wide range of conditions, including kidney and neurological damage, fatigue, vision problems, and tremors. Mercury poisoning in some animals is severe enough to result in death or reduced fecundity.\nWhile many people are aware of mercury contamination of fish, more recent studies have found that insects, and animals that eat them, also have high levels of mercury. Felice Stadler, from the National Wildlife Federation, says that \"the research shows birds that eat contaminated insects get contaminated themselves. Turkeys and chickens, which humans eat, eat those same contaminated insects, so this is the tip of the iceberg.\" \nConfirming previous studies, the report also finds high mercury levels in animals that eat fish. Because of the high mercury levels, 46 of the 50 states have issued advisories for pregnant women and children against eating certain types of fish, including tuna and swordfish. States have also issued other warnings because of mercury-contaminated foods. For example, Florida has issued a warning against eating alligator meat; Utah, against eating shoveler and goldeneye ducks. \nAccording to Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia, the National Wildlife Federation is the largest American conservation organization. The report, released on Tuesday, is based on 65 different scientific studies conducted by more than 20 scientists. It highlights that, in the United States, mercury is accumulating in a diversity of species, including species of fish, mammals, birds, reptiles, and amphibians, and in a diversity of environments, including freshwater, marine, and forest habitats. Some of the animals in which mercury is accumulating include songbirds, alligators, turtles, bats, otters, polar bears, mink, ducks, loons, and bald eagles. \nFelice Stadler says that the report \"underscored how pervasive mercury contamination has become. Nearly every aspect of our food web has been contaminated. It's difficult to find an ecosystem that's not contaminated, whether it's ocean or forest or coastal waters or wetlands.\"\nAccording to Wikipedia, mercury exposure in humans can result in brain damage, birth defects, severe neurological consequences, mercurial ptyalism, Minamata disease, and possibly autistic behaviors. \nIn the United States alone, mercury pollution is about 100 tons per year.

He also donated money to NDP candidates in the January election including $300 to Irene Mathyssen, who was a cabinet minister under Rae in the 1990s, and $250 to his former special assistant, Rochelle Carnegie, the NDP's candidate in Willowdale. Carnegie's Liberal rival was Jim Peterson, brother of former Ontario premier David Peterson whose government Rae defeated in 1990.\nScott Brison is the most generous Liberal having donated a total of $3175 to the party, its candidates and riding associations, followed by Ken Dryden who donated $2145, Joe Volpe who has donated $1695, Hedy Fry with $1323.49, Hall Findlay with $1290.85, Rae's $845 and Stephane Dion with $595.\nTotals do not include donations made by the candidates to their own leadership campaigns.

McNatty has been upheld by the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA). McNatty complained that he was not told of the special conditions of banner adverts he saw on the iHug website.\nMcNatty said: \"I signed up [to iHug] but discovered I had shot over my limit and iHUG had reduced my download speed from 100 to 64kps. I rang iHUG and they explained that I had gone over my 1 GB traffic allotment by 230%. I explained I was on the 3 GB plan and they went on to tell me that 2 of the 3GB can only be used between the hours of 2 a.m. and 10 a.m.\" He then went on to talk to the manager of iHug but was told there was nothing he could do so he asked to be upgraded to the more expensive option of the 15 GB plan.\niHug replied to the complaint by saying: \"It appears that M. McNatty has briefly looked at the front page of our broadband section without either reading down the page to the what you get section or clicking on the info or join now links on our website. If he had, he would have found information about the peak and off-peak split of data allowances. He has then rung the iHug call centre, where our call centre personnel have been instructed to inform customers of the details of data allowances because many customers don't understand how much data they will need. If the customer service representative has failed to explain how the data allowances work then that is a mistake on our part, for which I am sincerely apologetic. iHug has taken steps to resolve this by stressing to Customer Service Managers that they must remind their teams to fully explain data allowances during the sign up call.\"\niHug then went on to apologize to McNatty if felt he had been misled but said: \"I think it is unreasonable for M. McNatty to expect all information pertaining to a broadband application to be contained in detail on a small banner advert which is clearly design to capture interest only and lead the customer to further information.\"\nThe ASA complaint board then reviewed the advertisement and noted that the advertisement clearly identified that information related to the offer was available on other pages and that a customer would most likely know that plans varied and would ask for clarification before subscribing.\nBut then said, referring to the 3 GB plan advertisement; \"However, nowhere in the main offer or the immediate conditions headed, \"ihug broadband \u2013 what you get\", did it inform the consumer that 2 of the 3 GB could only be used between the hours of 2 a.m. and 10 a.m., one third being peak user time, two thirds being off-peak user time. This, in the Complaints Board's view, significantly diminished the offer of '3 GB data', to the extent that the offer could be considered to be 'exaggerated'. As such the Complaints Board said that it would be likely to mislead the consumer.\"\nThey also noted that the wording \"generous peak download allowance\" was a hyperbole and overstated the product offered, which amounted to misleading the customer.\nThe Complaints Board said: \"A website advertisement was not limited by a time constraint such as a television advertisement, or restricted by space available, and thereby there was no apparent reason why this paramount condition could not be more obvious in relation to the offer.\"\nThe complaints board then said that if special condition reduced the offer in value then those conditions need to be obvious. They noted that the ad does say conditions do apply. \"However, as the condition in this instance diminished the offer in a major way, the Complaints Board was unanimously of the view, that it should have been disclosed in an obvious manner, as part of the initial offer or in close proximity to it,\" said the complaints board.\nThe board then noted that the advertisement was in violation of the second rule in the Code of Ethics which states \"Truthful Presentation - Advertisements should not contain any statement or visual presentation or create an overall impression which directly or by implication, omission, ambiguity or exaggerated claim is misleading or deceptive, is likely to deceive or mislead the consumer, makes false and misleading representation, abuses the trust of the consumer or exploits his/her lack of experience or knowledge.

When speaking to the assembly, Ch\u00e1vez displayed the book \"Hegemony or Survival\", written by Noam Chomsky, and recommended \"this excellent book\" to the audience. He described this book as being written \"clearly and in depth\" an that \"the American empire is doing all it can to consolidate its system of domination.\"\nHe said that \"the hegemonic intentions of the imperialistic power are threatening the world\", and called on all the peoples of the world, including Americans, to respond to that threat.\nHe warned Americans that \"The devil is right at home. The devil -- the devil, himself, is right in the house. And the devil came here yesterday.\", apparently referring to the United States President w:George W.

Aristotle might not recognize it or others who are at the root of democracy.\"\nWhen pushing his agenda of democracy and free trade in Latin America, Ch\u00e1vez accused President Bush of being a racist, saying that President Bush would look \"at your color\" and he say \"oh, there's an extremist. Evo Morales, the worthy president of Bolivia, looks like an extremist to him.\"\nChavez indicated Bush discriminates against Morales because Morales was the country's first Indian president.\nThe newly elected president of Bolivia, announced plans of socializing part of the energy resources, particularly gas in Bolivia in 2005 in a move to try to be more independent from multinational coorporations.\nAs the president of the Bolivian Senate, Santos Ramirez, put it: \"Bolivia and Latin America are no longer the servile democracies that tolerate...poverty and the surrendering of sovereignty.\"\nChavez is pushing his own socio-economic agenda. For example the People's Trade Treaty consisting of Bolivia, Venezuela and Cuba and Mercosur, an economic union designed after the European Union for which in turn Bush sharply criticized him.\nChavez defended Morales in his speech by saying \"The imperialists see extremists everywhere. It's not that we are extremists. It's that the world is waking up.\"\nChavez referred to Bush's speech the day before, when Bush directly addressed the peoples of Afghanistan, Lebanon and Iran, telling the assembly \"what would those peoples of the world tell him if they were given the floor? What would they have to say? - They would say, \"Yankee imperialist, go home.\"\".\nTo address the current political issues he mentioned, Chavez complained that \"But we, the assembly, have been turned into a merely deliberative organ. We have no power, no power to make any impact on the terrible situation in the world. And that is why Venezuela once again proposes, here, today, 20 September, that we re-establish the United Nations.\"\nIn particular. he criticized the \"the anti-democratic\" veto held by the Permanent Five members of the Security Council,\nCiting the \"immoral\" veto of the United States which he said, \"allowed the Israelis, with impunity, to destroy Lebanon.\", referring to the 2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict\nChavez said that he wants to provide an \"alternative way of thinking\" and canvassed for the support of the international community for Venezuela to attain a seat on the United Nations Security Council to \"to save our planet, to save the planet from the imperialist threat.\" and \"for our children and our grandchildren a world of peace based on the fundamental principles of a renewed United Nations.\"\nU.S. Response.\nU.N. Ambassador John Bolton said the remarks don't warrant a response.\nThe US is currently lobbying for Venezuela not to attain a seat on the U.N. Security Council.\nRep. Charles Rangel (Democrats) who represents a New York City neighborhood which Chavez recently visited said \n\"I just want to make it abundantly clear to Hugo Chavez or any other president - don't come to the United States and think because we have problems with our president that any foreigner can come to our country and not think that Americans do not feel offended when you offend our Chief of State.

Transrapid trains are capable of speeds up to 450\u00a0km/h (280\u00a0mph). This accident is the first on the system that included fatalities; analysts so far attribute the cause of the accident to a lack of communications between the train operators and the maintenance employees. The only commercial installation of Transrapid technology in service is currently the Shanghai Maglev Train linking Shanghai Metro Line 2's Longyang Road station to Pudong International Airport."}

The number of cars in the city is set to increase from 2.7 million to 3 million by the time of the Olympics. Country-wide, annual car sales are expected to reach 10 million annually by 2010.\nA good infrastructure is one of the International Olympic Committee's top priorities when searching for bid cities. The IOC requires that athletes, support staff such as coaches, venue volunteers, spectators, and the press all should be able to get from venue to venue without hassle.\nExisting plans in Beijing say that private cars may only drive in the city on alternate days. Plates with odd numbers would drive one day, while even numbered licenses would drive the next day.\n\"Wired\" magazine has suggested fuel-cell vehicles may be China's next cultural revolution.

From the producer of \"Canada: A People's History\", \"H:APH\" is a ten-hour-long miniseries about the origins of Canada's most beloved past times.\nThe series debut, which aired Sunday on the CBC, centred on games in Nova Scotia and Montr\u00e9al as being the most importantc dates for the modern game. A group of enthusiasts called the Society for International Hockey Research has long supported the competition on March 3, 1875 in Montr\u00e9al as the game's birthplace. The game was describe in the news issue of the \"Montr\u00e9al Gazette\".\nHandley, however, supports the Northwest Territories town of Deline as the sport's true roots. British explorer John Franklin refers to his expedition team playing \"the game of hockey, played on the ice\", while at Grey Goose Lake outside what is now Deline. This journal entry, discovered in 2003, was written in October 1825. The Society for International Hockey Research at the time hailed this as an important finding for sport historians.\nHandley, who saw the episode on tape in his Yellowknife offices, told CanWest News Service that \"I was disappointed... [the filmmakers apparently] didn't do their research.\"\nThe Member of the Legislative Assembly for an area including Deline, Norman Yakeleya, called the documentary \"shameful. This is our holy grail. They didn't give any credit to the North.\"\nWhile the producers were aware of the expedition, and other early games, a CBC spokesperson suggests that the choice was made as the Montreal game is \"generally considered to have been clearly reflective of the modern game.\"\nThe Paul Gross-narrated documentary does make acknowledgements to stick and ball sports from Ancient Egypt, as well as golf-on-ice games in 16th-century Europe.\nHalifax-Dartmouth and Windsor, both of Nova Scotia, and Kingston, Ontario are three other cities who have laid claim to the honour."}

In May 2006, Fournier gave an interview to a French-language Toronto radio station, spending more than ten minutes recounting his love of what many refer to as \"pooing\".\nAccording to his account, Fournier was on a train ride in the 1960s with his friend Michel. Michel commented that he considered this particular usage of a washroom as being as great a pleasure as sexual intercourse.\nThe interview did not receive much attention at the time, due to a limited audience.\nIn the interview, Fournier comments \"as you grow older, you continue to go poop once a day if you are in good health, while it is not easy to make love every day. So finally, the pleasure is longer-lasting and more frequent than the other.\" He spoke out about distracting oneself on the toilet, and called doing a Sudoku or a crossword a \"heresy\". He continued that \"it is just as heretical as if you read the \"National Post\" while making love. It is not to be recommended.\"\nFournier was on \"Tout le monde\" to apologise for unsubstantiated claims that bestiality is permitted in Lebanon, so long as the animal is of the opposite sex. In the 9 September issue of \"7 Jours\", Fournier wrote \"In Lebanon, the law allows men to have sexual relations with animals as long as they are female! Doing the same thing with male beasts can result in the death penalty.\"\nHis claims were made solely on information found on the Internet.\nWhile an apology was made on the French-language program \"Tout le monde\", which averages over two million listeners, Alain-Michel Ayache at the Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al is unsure whether he'll drop his lawsuit.

The protest was originally supposed to take place in front of Siam Paragon.\nThe protesters wore black to symbolize the death of democracy and held banners criticizing the coup.\nSome of the protesters came from a group whose website, www.19sept.org, was previously shut down by the junta for breaking martial law because it criticized the coup.\nGiles Ungphakorn, a political scientist from Chulalongkorn University, said: \"We believe we speak for a significant number of Thais who are too worried or too afraid to speak.\". When information was spreading about the gathering, earlier that day, some were cautioned not to attend.\nThere are contradictions found in the two first reports by thai media about the protest. The Nation claims that nearly 100 people protested, while The Bangkok Post claims that the number is only 20. The Nation claims that police had recorded the protest on video, while The Bangkok Post claims that only Siam Center security guards were present.\nDue to censorship ordered on thai television by the junta, the protest was not shown on thai television. CNN has shown video footage of the protest, however, the thai cable company that broadcasts CNN within Thailand blocks all footage from CNN that talks about the coup.\nAlthough protests are banned by the junta, as are political gatherings of more than 5 people, a deputy commander said: \"police had recorded the protest on video and would examine the tape to see if protesters had broken martial law forbidding an assembly of more than five people for political purposes.\" It is unknown whether the police or junta will later arrest those it has recorded breaking martial law on video."}

Meanwhile, more details emerge in the case against alleged neo-Nazi group inside the Belgian army. They are accused of terrorism, weapons traffic and racism.\nMost lawyers involved asked for their clients to be released, and will appeal the court's decision. One lawyer said the police was being influenced politically to make the arrests now, before the elections of October 8, and that his client was more of a \"immature teenager and weapons freak\". The prosecutor is calling some suspects weapons dealers, but the defence lawyers claim they are weapons collectors, and say that terrorism is out of the question.\nA spokesperson for the justice department denied this formally, saying that \"The weapons traffic of the suspects began to take too large proportions, so we couldn't wait any longer.\" She also said the army informed them that they considered it too dangerous to take the soldiers involved along on uncoming international missions (Belgium is sending troups to Lebanon).\nThe prime suspect and alleged leader of the group is Thomas B. The police thinks he has a neo-Nazistic ideology and was planning attacks to destabilise Belgium. Thomas B. founded a splinter group of Blood and Honour called 'Bloed, Bodem, Eer en Trouw' (Eng: Blood, Soil, Honour and Fidelity), after the British headquarters of the skinhead organisation didn't let him found an official branch in Belgium.\nT.V. station VTM claimed the police tapped into phone conversations where Thomas B. was talking about killing Filip Dewinter and Dyab Abou Jahjah, two political leaders and opponents in Belgium. That way, both sides would cause an uprise and they could seize the opportunity. But the prosecutor's office has formally denied the existence of specific plans to this end.\nThe police has discovered numerous weapons, and a video showing a paramilitary training, not only on military grounds but also under a bridge in the city Dendermonde. The police say the tape shows how they fire guns and throw Molotov cocktails on that location.\nIn the political arena, Internal Affairs minister Patrick Dewael has suggested a law to forbid far right criminal organisations. The plan was applauded by some and contested by others. Earlier on Friday, the federal government supported the proposal to give more power to the national intelligence services to fight terrorism. Minister of Defence Andr\u00e9 Flahaut suspended 11 suspects inside the army. Prime minister Guy Verhofstadt said the entire affair was \"a blame for the country and the army\"."}

ONTRACK will retain the North Island main trunk line, while looking for tourism operators to start a tourist rail service.\nTrevor Mallard, acting Finance Minister, said: \"In making this decision... Cabinet recognised that there was no prospect of the current Overlander service becoming commercially viable. It was not a fuel-efficient operation and at an average passenger rate of 50 passengers each way per day, it was used by relatively few people.\"\nIt is cheaper and faster to travel either by bus or plane rather than the 12-hour train journey. \"The fares already overlap with airfares, and the reality is that the service is just not well-used. It can not compete with low-priced air travel and coaches. Cabinet considered the regional implications of ceasing the Overlander service and accepted that the current bus services run by the InterCity Group met the needs of those communities,\" Mallard said.\nThere has been numerous petitions from the public and from the Green Party of New Zealand to continue the Overlander train service, including one petition signed by 16,000 people presented at the Parliament Buildings on September 14, 2006. \"While there have been a number of propositions about retaining the Overlander service, all of the propositions would require government funding in one form or another,\" said Mallard.\nMallard said that the government will only support rail services if it significantly benefitted the community.\nThe Government estimates that financial assistance to the Overlander train service would cost NZ$1.75 million a year.\n\"Finally, the government does recognise and value the importance of a viable and efficient rail network in New Zealand's transport infrastructure. This was a critical factor in the government's decision to buy the rail network back from Tranz Rail. The government has also committed $200 million to upgrade the national rail network between 2004/05 and 2007/08.

Things didn't quite work out like that.\nAfter a few opening questions, Wallace raised the issue of Clinton's efforts to deal with Osama bin Laden, \"Why didn't you do more to put bin Laden and al-Quaeda out of business?\" The 60-year old ex-president took issue with this characterization of his record, highlighting his efforts to kill bin Laden and comparing them with the record of the current administration before September 11, 2001, \"they had no meetings on bin Laden for nine months after I left office.\"\nClinton's determination to rebut the implication that he had not done enough to kill bin Laden took the majority of the first two sections of the three-part interview. As well as condemning the inaction of \"neo-conservatives\" and accusing them of hypocrisy for describing his efforts to kill bin Laden as an \"obsession\", Clinton asked Wallace why the same questions were not put to the current administration about their pre-September 11 efforts, if any, to kill bin Laden. \nClinton pointed out that the political-right attacked his efforts to kill bin Laden as an attempt to \"wag the dog.\" He also said that he could not get the FBI or CIA to certify that bin Laden was responsible for the USS Cole attack, so his battle plans for attacking the Taliban in Afghanistan were not put into action.\nIn the much reduced amount of time devoted to Clinton's Global Initiative it was revealed that compared to last year's 2.5 billion dollars, this year commitments totaling more than $7.3 billion have been raised, $3 billion of that from Richard Branson's pledge to give all the profits from his rail operations."}

When the Taliban regime banned education for girls and forbade women from working outside the home, she ran an underground school for girls at her home, said her son Naqibullah, speaking to the \"Associated Press\". \nAfter the Taliban government was overthrown in 2001, Ahmed-jan became the provincial chief for women's affairs in 2002, when the ministry was established and has since then held that position, worked for women's rights and particularly, championed the cause of educating girls. Her secretary, Abdullah Khan told \"Associated Press\" that among her most successful projects were the vocational training schools she opened in Khandahar, where almost 1000 women were taught baking, tailoring and other skills. \nAhmed-jan has also been fiercely critical of the repression of women during the Taliban rule, in a region that has remained conservative and emerged as a hotbed of the Taliban's insurgent activity. Her requests for personal security guards and transport went unheeded by the government, according to local media reports, though her nephew, Muhammad Asif told the \"New York Times\" that Ahmed-jan preferred to keep a low profile and used a taxi or public transport even though her office maintained cars and drivers.\nEarly morning shooting.\nAhmed-jan was shot dead outside her house at about 7:30 a.m. local time (UTC+4:30) on Monday, as she left for work in a taxi. The gunmen are believed to have left scene on a motorcycle, and tyre marks have been found by the police, said the provincial governor Asadullah Khaled, who visited the scene of the attack. \nAhmed-jan was shot four times with a pistol, Muhammad Haidar, who worked in her office told the \"New York Times\". Mohammad Nader, the head nurse at Khandahar's main hospital where Ahmed-jan was taken to, confirmed to the \"Chicago Tribune\" that she was shot four times, including once in the head. \nShe was about 65 years old. \nAccounts of the shooting are sketchy, several reports suggesting no one witnessed it. However, one man, identified as Allaudin told \"Al Jazeera\" that he saw two men on motorcycles waiting on the road, who attacked Ahmed-jan as she left her house.\nA spokesman for the Khandahar governor, Daud Ahmadi confirmed the death and said that Ahmed-jan had died on the spot. An investigation into the attack has begun, and local officials have blamed the Taliban. \nHundreds of men and women, including the Governor Asadullah Khaled were present at Ahmed-jan's funeral on Monday evening, which took place in Khandahar's main Shia mosque.\nKilling condemned.\nThe killing has been strongly condemned by the Afghan President Hamid Karzai as well as aid and human rights organisations in Afghanistan.\nAleem Siddique, a spokesman for the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA), said that UNAMA was \"appalled at the senseless murder\" of a woman who was working to ensure a full and equal part in the future of Afghanistan for its women. He added, \"We share the sentiment of the majority of Afghan people who are appalled at this killing.\"\nAbdul Quadar Noorzai, head of the Afghan Independent Human Rights Commission (AIHRC) for the Khandahar region told \"IRIN News\" that Ahmed-jan's death will have a \"serious impact on women's activities in the south where women are already suffering from ... the deteriorating security and conservative traditions,\".\nFariba Ahmedi, a woman MP from Khandahar who was present at Ahmed-jan's funeral told the \"Associated Press\", \"The enemy of Afghanistan killed her, but they should know it will not derail women from the path we are on. We will continue on our way,\". \nSonja Bachmann, a U.N. political officer who knew Ahmed-jan well told the \"New York Times\" that Ahmed-jan \"did a good job, she worked in a very low-key way and worked hard to raise awareness about women's issues.\"\nClaim of responsibility.\n\"Reuters\" and \"Associated Press\" received phone calls, claiming responsibility for the attacks on behalf of Mullah Sadullah, a regional Taliban commander, but no confirmation of the claim has been possible.\nAnother caller, who identified himself as Taliban commander Mullah Hayat Khan told \"Al Jazeera\" that Ahmed-jan was killed because she worked for the government.\nAttacks mount.\nThe Taliban-led insurgency has stepped up attacks in recent months, killing hundreds of people this year. \nLast week, 19 Afghans working for reconstruction projects in the region were killed after their bus was ambushed.\nThe Governor of Paktia province, a close associate of President Karzai, was killed in a suicide bombing on September 10. \nAttacks on schools have also been stepped up. According to the Afghan education ministry, there have been 158 attacks on schools this year, compared to 146 last year. The attacks on schools are believed to be due partly to the Taliban's opposition to educating girls, as well as a way to undermine the Afghan government and it's reconstruction efforts. \nTwelve suspected militants and two Afghan police officers were reported killed on Monday in separate incidents which also left eight others and a U.S. soldier wounded. \n\"People are scared, of course,\" Ahmad-jan's co-worker Haidar said, \"How can we feel secure when the head of our department is killed in front of her house?\""}

Both governments have been criticized for not being tough enough on corruption, a hot political ticket in the duo.\nThe president of the Commission, Jose Manuel Barroso, has called for a pause in enlargement of the EU afterwards in order to carry out institutional reform within the Union and solve the question of a constitution for the EU, which became less certain last year when French and Dutch voters rejected the proposal. An EU treaty currently mandates institutional changes within the Union before the number of members go beyond the 27 maximum, which the Union will reach by the accession of the two new members.\nIf the two countries will not be able to comply with the terms, they may face consequences, some of which are directed specifically at the accession process but most of which are general requirements that all members face if they fail to meet certain standards. Specific to the accession of Romania and Bulgaria is losing up to a quarter of farm payments unless they succeed in setting up an operational database for animals called IACS by April 2007.\nFurthermore, corruption and organized crime have to be addressed. Some members of the Commission have said that allowing them to enter may actually help them tackle corruption more than it would be leaving them outside of the Union. Every six months, both countries will have to report on the progress to fight corruption.\nAlthough both economies are growing rapidly, they will be the poorest countries within the EU with GDP per capita only at about one third of the EU average. As always, there are debates about whether that's good or bad in terms of accession, some arguing that it will result in mass migration of workforce to richer countries resulting in unemployment, others by that the richer countries of the Union benefit the Union by going for cheap labor within itself, as opposed to for example India or China.\nTrade of pigs from the two countries will still be forbidden as farmers from both countries have had to deal with serious diseases in pigs.\nAll members of the EU have to ratify the entry of new members. France, Germany, Denmark and Belgium have yet to ratify the entry of the two countries, but analysts say that they're expected to do so soon, a refusal to do so being extremely unlikely."}

Six hostages were initially taken, but four were released. The remaining hostages were two girls who were being held hostage in a classroom located on an upper floor and reports say that the girls may have suffered some injuries during the raid.\nAccording to the secretary of the school district's superintendent, Jan Howard, students in both schools are in a \"safe location\", but police say that parents are not able to pick up their kids due to the closure of the main highway.\nSeveral shots were fired according to the sheriff's department, which are believed to be the \"loud noise\" that prompted the evacuation of the rest of the two schools.\nThe police had \"limited contact\" with Morrison and the hostages. Contact with them had been \"a little bit sporadic,\" said spokeswoman with the Jefferson County Sheriff's Office, Jacki Kelley.\n\"It's very sketchy at this stage but we can confirm that a man carrying a weapon is inside the building and two girls are being held hostage. The man entered a classroom at about noon and had an exchange with a teacher and fired more than one shot. We have no reports of any injuries. We know he is armed with a weapon because shots were fired but we do not know what kind of a weapon it is,\" added Kelley.\nMorrison was found to have used a revolver and a semi-automatic pistol when police removed his body after the raid. Upon further investigation, Morrison was also found to have been a homeless man who lived out of his car.\nPark County Sheriff Fred Wegener said authorities decided to storm the classroom after Morrison cut off negotiations and set a 4 p.m. deadline. Wegener wouldn't say what Morrison threatened to do. He said authorities used explosives as they entered the classroom, only to have the suspect fire at officers, shoot one of the girls and then himself.\n\"We have almost no information on this suspect. We don't know who he is. We don't know what he wants,\" said Kelley.\nAccording to Sheriff Wegener, Morrison also sexually assaulted at least one of the hostages while holding them captive.\nDuring the raid on the school, Morrison shot one of the hostages, identified by acquaintances and a co-worker as 16-year-old Emily Keyes. She was reported to have been bleeding heavily and was taken to a Denver hospital in critical condition, but was declared dead, a hospital spokeswoman said."}

He had identified himself as a security consultant.\nThe New Zealand Police then raided his home and took his computer on 21 September. Macridis told police that he did not think it was illegal, but knew he was not authorised to access the phone systems. Telecom then took him to court.\nColin McGilicray, police prosecutor, said: \"Macridis has a significant number of previous fraud convictions and it appeared he was trying to obtain money through virtue of his technical knowledge.\"\nMacridis, who represented himself, told the court that for 11-years he had worked as a casual security consultant and he had worked for Telecom, police and Department of Internal Affairs.\nMacridis thought himself as an honest, law abiding citizen as his 1994 conviction had 'turned his life around'.\nJudge Ian Mill said this case was very unusual and also noted that Macridis ended his offending over 10-years ago.\nMill said: \"Macridis used his talents to identify security risks and he had identified a grave risk to the Reserve Bank and its customers. Macridis provided a report of his findings, requested payment albeit without a contract and for his troubles was prosecuted. He did not pass the information on to others and did not use it for personal gain.\"\n\"In my view his intentions were honourable,\" Mill added.\nMill discharged him without conviction on the basis that a conviction would be out of proportion with his actions."}

Toll said that they reached the decision because of the huge amount of public support the train service received, including a 16,000 person petition.\nThe Overlander will originally run for only three days a week; Friday, Saturday and Sunday during winter on the original timetable. But during summer through to autumn the service will run seven days a week. Toll hopes that this will cover all the needs of its patrons.\nDavid Jackson, Toll NZ CEO, said: \"We have had tremendous support from the regional councils and will consider an upgraded service option and offering alternate packages aimed at both domestic users and the tourist market.\"\nJackson said: \"The continuation of the Overlander allows Toll to look at other funding options. We want to explore options that may be open to us to achieve this with the support and input of various interested parties. We especially appreciate the support of the regions to assist with marketing.\"\nThe decision comes days after the New Zealand Government announced that they will not provide financial assistance.\n\"Over the next few weeks we will be speaking to key people with the aim being of putting in place a clear plan for the positive development of the Overlander. Clearly it cannot remain in its current format so change will be fundamental for its survival. Reducing the services will allow us to perform refurbishments on the existing carriages and it [is] expected that this work will be completed by the start of the summer season.\"\nSue Morris, district mayor for Ruapehu, said: \"The decision to save the Overlander is a relief. It's hugely important, it's our future.

The footage presents Adam Lipi\u0144ski, a government minister and top aide of Prime Minister Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski offering Beger a government post, legal and financial aid in return for defecting from her party and joining the ruling coalition.\nThe conversation between the two politicians comes amidst a larger-scale effort on the part of the ruling Prawo i Sprawiedliwo\u015b\u0107 (\"Law and Justice\") party to woo members of former coalition partner Samoobrona to leave their party and support the governing coalition. The efforts follow the deposing of Samoobrona's leader Andrzej Lepper from his position as deputy prime minister, after he refused to support the budget proposal accepted by the Council of Ministers.\nThe broadcast of the footage has led to calls for the immediate dismissal of the government and for new elections to be held. Prawo i Sprawiedliwo\u015b\u0107 has called the revealed conversation \"normal practice\", and ruled out the possibility of the government stepping down. The scandal, however, severely complicates the party's attempt to rebuild parliamentary majority and undermines their public support, as its popularity was built on declarations of fighting corruption in politics.\nThe day after the footage was aired, protesters started gathering before the buildings of the parliament, and some pitching tents to spend the night there."}

The ban would not involve grocery stores, or natural trans fat that is present in dairy products or meat from ruminants.\nThe proposal follows a campaign last year to encourage restaurants to cut down on using trans fat themselves, but recent surveys show that the campaign was unsuccessful. In 2003, the city already instituted a smoking ban in restaurants, which was met with protest, but the measure has been copied in many other states since.\nIn Western countries, most trans fat in food today is the result of industrial processing, and has been linked to coronary heart disease. Frying oils, shortening and margarines with trans fats have easier storing requirements. Artificial trans fat is considered by some experts to be even more dangerous than natural trans fat.\nThe new limit would be at 0.5 grams of trans fatty acids per menu item, whereas a typical serving of French fries contains about 8 grams. It would be instituted in several phases, allowing time for eateries to adapt.\nThe plan would also have serious implications for both fast food chains and restaurants. A spokesperson for the New York State Restaurant Association reacted with disbelief, stating that \"Labeling is one thing, but when they totally ban a product, it goes well beyond what we think is prudent and acceptable,\" referring to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's requirement for food labels to list trans fat, a measure taken last January.\nThe Boards Health Commissioner Dr. Thomas Frieden on the other hand said the ban would be a challenge for cooks, but substitute oils can easily be found. Comparing it to lead paint, he said \"It is a dangerous and unnecessary ingredient\", adding that \"No one will miss it when it's gone.\"\nA similar ban is being considered in Chicago, but would only target companies with annual revenues over $20 million, thereby targeting exclusively major fast-food restaurants. The U.S. brands Wendy's, Crisco, Frito-Lay, Starbucks, Subway, and Kraft's have already taken action to remove trans fat from some of their products.\nDenmark became the first country in the world imposing strict regulations on trans fatty acids in March 2003. McDonalds consequently started using trans fat-free oils in Denmark, but has not yet switched over in the United States.\nA public hearing is scheduled on October 30, and a final vote on the proposal is scheduled for December."}

LeDrew is running against incumbent Mayor of Toronto David Miller, who is seeking a second term and city councillor Jane Pitfield, who was considered Miller's main challenger until today. With LeDrew entering the race there are a total of 38 candidates running for the position. The election takes place on November 13, 2006.\nMiller is a centre-left politician with links to the New Democratic Party though he also has support from some Liberals and Conservatives. His opponents have been looking for a candidate to challenge him in light of what has been perceived as Jane Pitfield's faltering candidacy. LeDrew considered supporting Pitfield but, calling her \"Calamity Jane\" because of the mistakes she's made in her campaign, concluded she could not unseat the mayor. After other high-profile figures such as former Members of Parliament Dennis Mills and Sergio Marchi and former police chief Julian Fantino declined to enter the contest as a centre or centre-right candidate, LeDrew decided to enter the race. Today was the last day to register as a candidate. \nLeDrew has never run for public office though he has many years of experience as a \"back room\" operative in the Liberal Party and in municipal politics. In 2005, he declared bankruptcy and was ordered to pay 74% of the $364,000 he owed in back taxes. \n\"The evidence is that LeDrew consciously and continually neglected to pay income tax installments when due and appeared to regard his obligation to pay income tax as subordinate to all other personal obligations,\" wrote Justice John Ground of the Superior Court of Justice.\nLeDrew says he was trying to pay off his tax debt but also had to pay personal expenses such as school fees for his children. \n\"I'd gone through a divorce. I was in a law firm ... that broke up and I lost money in that. I had four children to put into schools.\"\n\"I was also working 2,000 hours a year (as a) volunteer as Liberal Party president. I said , 'I owe taxes. The taxpayer can wait. My children can not.'\"\n\"I was proud of my choices, my priorities,\" he told the \"Toronto Star\". \"I'd do it again. Any father knows his children are the most important thing.\""}

He also stated that the attacks had been masterminded by Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) and carried out by Pakistani and Indian nationals.\nFifteen people, twelve of whom were directly involved in the execution of the bombings are in custody, eleven of them are Pakistani citizens. \nThe conspiracy to carry out the attacks, which killed 190 people, was hatched in the vicinity of Mumbai, by militants who were trained in Bahwalpur, Pakistan. The Pakistani bombers entered India in batches, some through the porous Indo-Nepal border, others via Bangladesh and some through Gujarat. They then reached Mumbai around May 25, and were sheltered in Malad and Bandra by Faizal Sheikh. Kamaluddin Ansari and Ehtasham Siddiqui, (General Secretary of SIMI, Maharashtra) were also involved in the conspiracy.\nThe RDX explosive used in the blasts was brought from Pakistan by a man called Ehsanullah, while the ammonium nitrate was procured locally. The explosives were assembled in Chembur by Mumbai resident Mohammad Ali, between 8 and 10 July. On the day of the attacks, the bombs (each containing 2 - 2.5\u00a0kg of RDX and 3.5 \u2013 4\u00a0kg of ammonium nitrate) were concealed in eight pressure cookers and transported to the railway stations in taxis.\nFrom there two member teams of bombers placed the explosives on the trains and detonated them using quartz timers. One of the militants, Saleem, a native of Lahore, could not (as was the plan) get off the train before the explosives went off, as a result of which he perished in the blast between Khar and Bandra. Of the seven Indian suspects, four (Faizal Sheikh, Kamaluddin Ansari, Ehtashan Siddiqui and Naved) have been apprehended, while a search is on for the other three. \nMr. Roy described the bombings as a \"professional, precise and well-planned\". The first clue his department got was a phone call made from Navi Mumbai to a place on the Indo-Nepal border. Based on this information Kamaluddin Ansari was arrested in from Madhubani, Bihar. Narco-analysis of the other suspects revealed that they were trained in Pakistan and also helped tie up other loose ends in the case. Faizal Sheikh also revealed that he had received Rs. 60,00,000 from Pakistan in the last few years. Police also recovered 26,000 Riyals, given to him by Rizwan Devra, an ISI operative living in Dubai, from Faizal's house. \nPakistan's Minister of State for Information, Tariq Azim, denied the role of the ISI in the bombings, saying that his country \"rejected\" the accusation, and that India should provide Pakistan with \"any information if they have it\". \"Such allegations only give benefit to the real culprits, who escape arrest,\" he said."}

At least 5 people are dead, 6 others injured, 2 critically and least 3 cars are reported to be trapped underneath the overpass. Authorities have stated that 3 cars and a motorcycle were on the overpass when it collapsed. \nRescue workers and construction engineers have brought in heavy equipment, cranes and drills to break up the overpass into roughly a dozen smaller segments for removal. At the time of the collapse, authorities reported that 2 vehicles were trapped under the debris. Around midnight, the two vehicles were removed from the debris, and the five occupants of both vehicles were pronounced dead on the site. \nTransport Quebec and S\u00fbret\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec have reported that around 9:30 a.m. local time, people called 911, reporting that small chunks of concrete had fallen from the Boulevard de la Concorde (Concorde Boulevard) overpass over Autoroute 19, and Transport Quebec sent a crew to inspect. At around 11:55 a.m., Transport's Qu\u00e9bec patrol arrived at the overpass confirming the facts. The patroller moved the chunks off the highway and produced a report, sent to the Transports Quebec branch responsible for Laval. \nThe incident happened at approximately 12:30 p.m. local time, local residents described what sounded like \"an earthquake\". It is not known at this time how the collapse occurred, or when it might be repaired. It is currently assumed that the cement bondings to the steel rods which held the overpass to its approaches gave way, and with nothing to hold the overpass' central span up, it collapsed.\nThis isn't the first overpass collapse in Laval. In 2000, a section of the Highway 15 overpass collapsed, killing one and injuring two others. It was later determined that the collapse in 2000 was caused by a manufacturing defect."}

These samples were collected from apparently healthy birds and initial test results indicate the presence of low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) virus, which poses no threat to human health,\" said the USDA in a statement on its website.\nSamples from the ducks were retrieved on September 24, 2006 and were found in the Rice Lake Conservation Area of Fulton County located in Illinois. The USDA and the Illinois Department of Natural Resources tested the samples as part of a Bird Flu monitoring program. The USDA also says that they do not expect to find any \"additional cases of common strains of avian influenza in birds.\"\n\"These strains of the virus include LPAI H5N1, commonly referred to as \"North American\" H5N1, which is very different from the more severe HPAI H5N1 circulating overseas,\" said the statement.\nThe ducks are not believed to be infected with the deadly H5N1 virus, but officials say both subtypes H5 and N1 have been found in the samples.\n\"Eleven samples were collected directly from the ducks. Of those samples, a pool of five samples tested positive for H5 and were sent to USDA's National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL) in Ames, Iowa, for confirmatory testing. One of the five samples screened by NVSL tested positive for both H5 and N1. However, this does not mean these ducks are infected with an H5N1 strain. It is possible that there could be two separate avian influenza viruses, one containing H5 and the other containing N1,\" continued the statement.\nThe USDA adds that the virus can cause \"minor sickness or no noticeable symptoms in birds,\" but that these ducks were all healthy. The USDA also said that hunters and hunting dogs are not at risk for any infection, as these ducks are commonly hunted.\n\"Duck populations, including Green-winged Teal, are commonly hunted. There is no known health risk to hunters or hunting dogs from contact with low pathogenic forms of avian influenza virus. Nevertheless, hunters are always encouraged to use common sense sanitation practices, such as hand washing and thorough cooking, when handling or preparing wildlife of any kind,\" added the statement."}

There were two divers who planted the bombs in Auckland Harbour, known to the police after they were photographed in the South Island as Alain Tonel and Jaques Camurier.\nNew Zealand Police and the New Zealand Government say that they are probably not going to charge anyone else even if they confess to the bombing. Two people, Dominique Prieur and Alain Mafart, were the only ones ever convicted in the bombing of the Rainbow Warrior.\nAntoine Royal, brother of Segolene Royal said to \"Parisien\" newspaper: \"My brother Gerard was a member of the French intelligence sabotage squad who planted the bombs on the Rainbow Warrior. At the time, (Gerard) was a lieutenant and agent of the DGSE (intelligence agency) in Asia. He was asked in 1985 to go to New Zealand, to Auckland harbour, to sabotage the Rainbow Warrior. Later he told me that it was he who planted the bomb on the Greenpeace ship. He took a small craft with a second person to approach the boat.\"\nIn 1991 New Zealand made a deal with France to a stay of proceedings of those involved in the bombing.\nAntoine added: \"He was able to escape the New Zealand authorities, unlike the false Turenge couple who were arrested. My sister learnt that he was present during the operation from a recent article in the press.\"\nBunny McDiarmid, Greenpeace executive director, who was on the Rainbow Warrior when it was attacked said: \"I accept there is now little prospect of the bomber being brought to justice. Those responsible are getting away with murder.\"\nThe bombing resulted in the death of one man, photographer Fernando Pereira. Prieur and Mafart were prosecuted for the manslaughter of Pereira, they pleaded guilty. Pereira's daughter, Marelle, said: \"My dad has been murdered...I don't see it as manslaughter...I don't see it as accidental killing.\""}

Former , Bob Rae, is second with 767 delegates (19.8%), while former federal Environment minister Stephane Dion and former Ontario education minister Gerard Kennedy are battling for third place with 648 and 646 delegates respectively (16.7%). While no clear challenger to Ignatieff has emerged, analysts say that the frontrunner is vulnerable if an \"Anybody but Ignatieff\" movement emerges and the opposition to him coalesces around one of Rae, Dion or Kennedy on the convention floor in December. \n\"I feel I'm tremendously well placed,\" Ignatieff told CBC News on Sunday, \"I think I've earned their confidence and trust, but we do have two months to go.\"\n\"It's a different kind of campaign from here on in,\" said Kennedy.\n\"The whole purpose of the exercise this weekend is to get in position where we can make a run for the prize,\" Rae said.\n\"We have not the biggest machine, but the biggest heart,\" Dion said of his campaign.\nThe results vary around the country. Rae, though a former Ontario premier, has come in third in that province with 17.3% delegate support, well behind Ignatieff and Kennedy who are neck-in-neck in Canada's largest province with 27.3% and 26.7% support respectively. \nIn Quebec, Kennedy has proven to be weak, winning only 10 delegates or 1% of the province's total while Ignatieff leads with 38.4% and Dion and Rae battle for second place with 29.1% and 24.2% support respectively.\nRae is the leader in Newfoundland, Manitoba and Prince Edward Island as well as in British Columbia where he is well ahead of Kennedy, Dion and Ignatieff in that order while Kennedy leads in Alberta where he has three more delegates than Ignatieff. \nIgnatieff leads in Saskatchewan, New Brunswick, Yukon and the Northwest Territories.\nAcross the country, the other four candidates all have less than 5% support.

They will be joined by approximately 1,000 delegates who will attend either because they are Members of Parliament, Senators or former Cabinet ministers or because they've been chosen by various committees. Nevertheless, this weekend's results are expected to give a rough idea of what the first ballot results of the convention will be.\nAbout 190,000 party members were eligible to vote in this weekend's exercise."}

National Civil Aviation Agency (ANAC) has confirmed that the crashed Brazilian airplane did crash into a smaller aircraft. Rescue workers and air force personnel are searching the wreckage for bodies \nSearch and rescue teams arrive.\nSearch and rescue teams rappelled down ropes or hacked a way through the rainforest, led by local Indians to reach the wreckage.\nThe first people at the scene had to abseil down to clear away trees to allow helicopters to land.\n\"It's extremely difficult to get there,\" said Ademir Ribeiro, a foreman on the nearby Jarina ranch, the centre for rescue operations.\nAbout 80 air force personnel were at the site during the day and about thirty stayed during the night. \nAn air force statement says that the first two bodies were recovered on the afternoon of Sunday, October 1. The bodies were taken to an air force base by helicopter. \nOfficials say that the investigation would take at least three months. Milton Zuanazzi, director of the National Civil Aviation Agency, says that he does not know how long the removal of bodies would take.\n737 Crashed, Legacy made emergency landing.\nA Embraer Legacy 600 owned by ExcelAire, a charter company based in Long Island, New York clipped the Boeing 737-800 SFP. The Legacy made an emergency landing at Cachimbo air force base with five passengers and two crew on board, none of whom were hurt. The Boeing plunged nose first into the rainforest and disintegrated. \nWhen interviewed by the police, the passengers on the Legacy reported feeling a bump at the time of the collision. The pilot landed the plane manually. \nAn Air Force statement said that a search of the site showed no signs that the 149 passengers and six crew on board the Boeing 737 could have survived the crash.\n\"Neither of the pilots can understand how a 737 could have hit us without them seeing it,\" said Joe Sharkey, a journalist for the \"New York Times\", in an email to his wife. \nMr. Zuanazzi says it's possible as they were traveling at hundreds of miles an hour.\n\"They said they didn't see anything. But this is absolutely normal. \u2026In these conditions, you can only see a shadow and a noise,\" said Zuanazzi.\nQuestions over collision avoidance system.\nInvestigators are trying to determine why two new aircraft equipped with the latest anti-collision technology could have collided. The Brazilian air force says that both planes were equipped with a Traffic Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) which sounds an alarm when planes get too close.\n\"It locks on the other plane's transponders and tells the pilot whether to go up or down,\" John Hansman, aeronautics professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said by telephone.\n\"The 737 should have been warned to take evasive action.\"\nHansman said that in air traffic in Brazil is complicated in some parts and vast areas are not covered by radar especially over the ocean on the Amazon Rainforest. Pilots often propose a route and at certain points check with controllers who verify the plane's location, altitude and bearing.\n\"Apparently that process broke down somehow,\" Hansman said. \"When you get to the jungles of Brazil, you have people going in all directions.\"\nThe Brazilian mass communications media are suggesting that a lapse in communication caused the crash. Rio de Janeiro daily \"O Globo\" reported that air traffic controllers in the city of Manaus cleared the Boeing to fly at 37,000 feet and Bras\u00edlia authorised the Legacy to climb from 35,000 feet to 39,000 feet. Ag\u00eancia Estado reports the Legacy pilot Joseph Lepore and co-pilot Jan Palladino told police in Mato Grosso that they had authorisation from Bras\u00edlia to fly at 37,000 feet and that the anti-collision equipment never sounded a warning.\nBlackboxes recovered.\nThe cockpit voice recorder and the digital flight data recorder of both planes have been recovered. The blackbox of the Legacy was taken to Embraer's headquarters at Sao Jose dos Campos, Sao Paulo.\nBrazil's Civil Aviation Agency said the cause of the crash was impossible to say until the Boeing 737's two recorders, found by search teams, were examined.\nDale Oderman, associate professor of aviation technology at Purdue University said investigators will be paying close attention to the conversations between the pilots and air traffic controllers said.\n\"It might indicate they were flying an altitude they weren't cleared to fly,\" Mr. Oderman said.\nBill Waldock, aviation safety professor at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in Prescott, Arizona, says that the Legacy may have clipped the bigger jet's horizontal stabiliser \u2014 fins that prevent the airplane from pitching up or down.\n\"A likely reason why the 737 would depart continuous flight and go vertically into the jungle at that speed would be damage or loss of the horizontal stabiliser,\" Mr. Waldock said.\nRelatives flown over crash site.\nRelatives of the passengers have complained that they were not being informed about the ongoing search for bodies or the investigation. The air force has flown them in groups of six over to the crash site. The air force says that it was to show them how difficult it is to reach the crash site.\n\"They will be able to see the difficulties of the operation... The place is difficult [to access], there are trees of up to 40 meters (130 feet) tall,\" a spokesman said. \"The debris is scattered so rescue work is even more complicated.\"\nWorst air disaster in Brazilian history.\nThis is the worst air disaster in Brazilian history, surpassing the June 1982 crash of a VASP flight which hit a mountain near Fortaleza in northeastern Brazil, killing 137 people.\nPresident Lula has declared three days of national mourning."}

COBE revealed fluctuations in faint microwave signals from space that are thought to be remnants of the Big Bang.\nAlthough the precise origin of the fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background is not yet clear, they may represent clumps in the very early universe that led to the galaxies seen today. \nPrior to the COBE map of the universe, it was unclear why the universe contained stars and galaxies rather than an evenly distributed dust cloud. Theorists had predicted that a sensitive measurement of microwaves from the sky would reveal minute temperature fluctuations, which represent variations in the density of matter in the early universe. The denser portions served as seeds for galaxies that formed later. COBE was the first experiment sensitive enough to confirm the predicted temperature variations encoded in the map of the microwave background.\nThe initial discovery of the Cosmic Microwave Background by Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson led to their award of the 1978 Nobel Prize in physics.

Each one of the candidates is a roughly Jupiter-size body that orbits its host star in just 4 days or less. Five of the possible discoveries whip around their stars in less than an Earth day \u2014 causing the astronomers to group them into a new class of \"ultra-short-period planets.\"\nIn results published in this week's edition of the journal Nature the team of astronomers, headed by Kailash Sahu (Space Telescope Science Institute), used Hubble's Advanced Camera for Surveys to monitor a portion of the galactic bulge in Sagittarius continuously for seven days, shooting one picture every six minutes. Over 180 planet candidates were identified, making the task of arriving at only 16 quite difficult. The biggest source of false alarms was transits by Jupiter-size red dwarf stars. Processing the data took an entire year. \"This was the most complex project I have worked on,\" says Sahu.\nThis discovery now allows scientists to be relatively certain planets need elements heavier than hydrogen and helium to form. These are typically found in stars that formed after others died, creating a dependence on location and formation. A previous search in 2000 by Dr. Ron Gilliland turned up no planets, even though he assumed they would find as many as 17. The currently accepted reason is that Gilliland's study focused on a stellar nebula, where all of the stars had formed at the same time, and therefore there was a very low abundance of heavier elements.\nSahu knew some scientists would be skeptical of his findings and so he confirmed two of the planets by using the Very Large Telescope (VLT) in Chile to measure the movements of the stars caused by their orbiting partner, a technique known as measuring the radial velocity of the star. Although Sahu believes that at least fifty percent of the candidates have to be planets, he cannot be completely certain. \"I think a lot of people will take issue with that,\" says Dr. Sara Seager, Staff Scientist of the Department of Terrestrial Magnetism at the Carnegie Institution of Washington, on Sahu's uncertainty. \"There are lots of nasty tricks nature can pull on us.\"\nMore rigorous confirmation will have to wait for new technology, specifically NASA's James Webb Space Telescope, to be launched in 2013. Even so, Seager believes this is still \"tremendously exciting. It doubles the amount of transiting planets found!\"\nWith two other transiting extrasolar planets announced in September, the confirmed SWEEPS finds brings the number of known \u2014 and confirmed \u2014 transiting planets to 14."}

Environmental groups, including the Sierra Club, were given permission to intervene in the case in support of the actions of the Corps.\nEnvironmental groups were pleased with the decision, but are concerned over other actions of the Bush Administration, such as the attempts to weaken provisions of the 2002 Clean Water Act to allow additional dumping of construction and mining waste into waterways as fill material."}

The units that have been shut down were responsible for weapons-making, arms smuggling and training. The IRA decommissioned their arms last year.\nThe report also mentions that the IRA has also put its criminality beyond use and is \"clamping down\" on criminals within the organization, said Lord Alderdice, as he presented the report.

The Real IRA was the group behind the deadly 1998 Omagh bombing.

The alarm was given by a man outside of the bank who noticed the robbery.\nThe rapid response by the Pol\u00edcia de Seguran\u00e7a P\u00fablica's (PSP) district command of Set\u00fabal forced the robber to barricade himself in the bank with two employees and two clients who were in the bank at the time of the robbery. Cornered, the man decided to take the four people hostage, not allowing many contacts on the part of the police negotiators.\nAccording to a PSP source, the kidnapper was armed with a 6.35m pistol and said to the negotiators that he had a explosive device with him. The police immediately sealed off the block and interrupted all telecommunications in the area, only allowing calls to the Portuguese emergency telephone number.\nAt 0308 local time (0238 UTC) a dozen members of the Police Special Operations Group (GOE) stormed the bank. According to PSP's officer Manuel Augusto Silva, the kidnapper was armed but was surprised by the members of the GOE team and didn't react, being immediately arrested.\nSome minutes later, the two bank employees, a 20 year old women and a 30 year old man left the bank building. The two clients were then handcuffed and escorted from the building and were not identified.\nThe last to leave the bank was the kidnapper, who left escorted by the police officers and with his head covered.\nAs the victims, kidnapper and members of the special forces officers left the bank, a bomb disposal unit entered the bank to inspect the possible bomb of the kidnapper. A suspicious package was later detonated by the technicians following security procedures, but no explosives were found.\nAlthough both the Portuguese authorities and news agencies had said that two of the hostages were female, the hostages were in fact three men and a women. Also, the news of a \u20ac100,000 ransom requested by the kidnapper wasn't confirmed.\n\"There wasn't any record of any kind of injuries on the police officers involved, on the four hostages, nor on the detainee\" Jer\u00f3nimo Torrado, officer of the PSP of Set\u00fabal, said."}

Recognizing the right of an individual to marry a person of the same sex will not diminish the validity or dignity of opposite-sex marriage, any more than recognizing the right of an individual to marry a person of a different race devalues the marriage of a person who marries someone of her own race,\" said Kline.\n\"The fact that same-sex couples have traditionally been prohibited from marrying is the reason this lawsuit [to allow same-sex marriages] was commenced,\" added Kline\nGay advocate groups say they will appeal the court's decision.\n\"The court understood that marriage has a meaning, and that unless you redefine marriage all the arguments the other side have made are meaningless,\" said attorney for the Alliance Defense Fund, Glen Lavy.\n\"While we are disappointed that the Court of Appeal ruled against our families, we are confident that we will prevail and that the California dream will be available to all,\" said the executive director of Equality California, Geoff Kors.\nDespite the ruling, California does allow civil unions along with Connecticut, Hawaii, New Jersey, Maine and Vermont.

In future this new unit will cause an efficiency rise up to 255MW for each turbine.\nCurrently, the Bratsk Power Station operates 18 hydro-turbines, each with capacity of 250MW, produced by the Leningrad Metal Works (\"LMZ\") in the 1960s. The plant is the second level of the Angara Hydroelectric Stations cascade. Since its full commissioning in 1967, the station was the world's single biggest power producer until Canada's Churchill Falls in 1971. Annually the station produces 22.6 billion kWh.\nThe precious 80 tonne cargo was transported to Pulkovo International airport of Saint-Petersburg where it was loaded on Antonov An-124-100 Ruslan to made all the way to Bratsk by air. On October 4, 2006 it landed in the Bratsk airport. In two days the unit 16 replacement arrived to the assemble place on the Angara river.\nSergey Emdin, CEO of IrkutskEnergo JSC, noted the press that the Bratsk plant reconstruction project includes not only the economical, but the ecological aspect by reducing carbon dioxide emission for 6 million tonnes for the period of 2008-2012.\nIn 2006 and 2007 the old plant is scheduled to receive two more working wheels - by one for each year respectively, and in 2008 and 2009 another four - by two for each year."}

Coincidentally, October 7 is the birthday of Russian President Vladimir Putin.\nAnna Politkovskaya worked for the \"Novaya Gazeta\" newspaper. She rose to fame for her coverage of the human costs of the Chechen conflict and her harsh criticism of the Kremlin's policies on Chechnya. She was also one of the people who went into the Moscow theatre during the 2002 hostage taking to attempt negotiations, at the behest of the Chechen militants. \nPolitkovskaya was found shot dead in an elevator in her apartment block in central Moscow, the \"Associated Press\" reports, citing police sources. The \"Interfax\" news agency reports that her body was found by a neighbour and that four cartridges and a handgun were also found in the elevator. Her death has been confirmed by Dmitry Muratov, editor of the \"Novaya Gazeta\" and Moscow prosecutors. \nShe was 48 years old and was writing her fourth non-fiction work, \"Putin's Russia\". Her earlier books include \"Under Putin and A Dirty War: A Russian Reporter in Chechnya\" and \"A Small Corner of Hell: Dispatches from Chechnya\". She won several awards for her work on the Chechen conflict. \nPolitkovskaya had received threats before. She moved to Vienna for a short time in 2001 after receiving e-mail warnings that a Russian police officer, Sergei Lapin, who she had accused of atrocities, was seeking revenge. In 2005, Lapin was found guilty of crimes against Chechen civilians and sentenced to 11 years imprisonment. \nDuring the 2004 Beslan school siege, Politkovskaya was taken ill with suspected food-poisoning. The incident was suspected by some of her colleagues to be a deliberate attempt at poisoning.\nPresident Putin, breaking the two days' silence, vowed Monday 9 October to track down Politkovskaya's killers.\nThe funeral will be held on Tuesday, 10 October, at 2 p.m., at the Troyekurovskoye Cemetery in Moscow."}
