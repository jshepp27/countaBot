Just under thirty minutes later, AMC-21 separated from the upper stage of the carrier rocket into a geostationary transfer orbit, marking the successful completion of the launch.\nSuperbird 7 was constructed by Mitsubishi, and will provide multimedia broadcasting to Japan, and other parts of Asia. It is the first commercial satellite to be built using the DS-2000 bus, although three DS-2000 satellites have already been launched for the Japanese Government. It will be placed in a geostationary orbit at a longitude of 144\u00b0 East. It is the last satellite to be launched for SCC, prior to its planned merger into the SKY Perfect JSAT Group\nAMC-21 will be used for television broadcasting to North America. It will be placed into a geosynchronous orbit with two degrees of inclination, at a longitude of 125\u00b0 West. AMC-21 was constructed by Thales Alenia Space, based on a STAR-2 bus produced by Orbital Sciences Corporation. It will be operated by SES Americom, a United States based subsidiary of Luxembourgian company SES S.A.. It is the first SES satellite to be launched since the AMC-14 satellite was lost in a launch failure on a Proton rocket earlier. AMC-14 has since been sold to the US Government for technology development experiments including radar targeting.\nThe satellites were enclosed in a long payload fairing, which separated shortly after the rocket reached space, around three minutes and ten seconds after launch. A SYLDA-5 dual payload adapter was used, with Superbird 7 located in the upper position, and AMC-21 underneath. The launch was conducted by Arianespace, a French Launch Service Provider\nSpeaking after the launch, Jean-Yves Le Gall, the CEO of Arianespace said that he was \"very happy to share this new success\". Yukata Nagal, the Chief Executive of SCC, said that he was \"very glad\" that the launch was successful. Rick Starkovs, one of the Vice Presidents of SES said that he felt felt \"very good\" watching the successful launch.\nThis was the 39th launch to orbit so far this year, and the 38th to reach orbit. It is the fifth of seven planned Ariane 5 launches this year, and the 41st Ariane 5 launch overall. The next Ariane 5 is scheduled to launch in October, with the Hot Bird 9, NSS-9, and Spirale satellites."}

The deal, reached on Thursday, concluded almost two years of negotiations, so far delayed by Poland, reluctant to irritate its eastern neighbour. However, in view of the Russian offensive in Georgia, these concerns have been superseded.\nThe missiles, staffed with American personnel, are designed for defence against medium- and long-range ballistic missiles. In exchange for providing the base, Poland will get 96 latest-generation PAC-3 for defence against aircraft and short-range missile attacks. Part of the deal obliges the United States to defend Poland in case of an attack, with greater speed than normally required under NATO.\n\"Poland wants to be in alliances where assistance comes in the very first hours of - knock on wood - any possible conflict\" the Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said. \"It is no good when assistance comes to dead people.\"\nRussia reacted to the agreement with anger. According to the Associated Press, the Russian deputy chief of general staff stated that the deal exacerbated the Russia\u2013United States relations and \"cannot go unpunished.\"\nAccording to Russian news agency Interfax, the agreement to accept a U.S. missile interceptor base exposes Poland to a Russian nuclear attack.

Following the speech, a regular Wikipedia editor noticed that his speech was very similar to an article on \"Wikipedia\" also regarding the crisis, in what could be considered plagiarism. \"Wikinews\" was able to talk to that editor about how he found out about the similarities and what he did in response. \"Wikinews\" also took a deeper look at the claim and investigated further.\nMcCain gave his speech in Erie, Pennsylvania and was speaking to citizens, giving a warning to Russia stating, \"Russian President Medvedev and Prime Minister Putin must understand the severe, long-term negative consequences that their government\u2019s actions will have for Russia\u2019s relationship with the U.S. and Europe.\"\nMcCain continued his speech saying, \"Georgia is an ancient country, at the crossroads of Eastern Europe and Central Asia, and one of the world\u2019s first nations to adopt Christianity as an official religion. After a brief period of independence following the Russian revolution, the Red Army forced Georgia to join the Soviet Union in 1922. As the Soviet Union crumbled at the end of the Cold War, Georgia regained its independence in 1991, but its early years were marked by instability, corruption, and economic crises.\"\nWhile reading the first few paragraphs, the \"Wikipedia\" editor Killing Vector, (who wishes to be called by his contributor name in fear of retribution for coming forward with the claim), noticed a striking similarity to McCain's speech and the \"Wikipedia\" article on the country of Georgia. Not only did he notice the similarities, but after reading through the article's edit history, 'Killing Vector' noticed that his speech might have been lifted from \"Wikipedia\", with some of the material in McCain's speech dating prior to the start of the Georgian and Russian crisis.\n\"I began reading the text of McCain's address on the Georgia crisis, and as I was browsing it the irregularity jumped out almost immediately. The paragraphs which discussed the history of Georgia simply didn't fit with the rest of the speech; the rhetorical style was jarringly different. I figured, \"where's someone in a hurry going to get basic information on the Republic of Georgia?\" I opened up \"Wikipedia\", went to the article, picked a recent but not current revision more or less at random (July 24th), and hit gold on the first try; McCain's speech and the \"Wikipedia\" article had significant strings of words in common, emphasized the same events, made largely the same word choices,\" Vector said to \"Wikinews\".\nAlthough other media outlets reported the alleged plagiarism, the two passages below were dated at least one week prior to the Georgian and Russian crisis. The first two paragraphs of McCain's speech appear to resemble the \"Wikipedia\" article in the history dated July 24, 2008. \n\"Two paragraphs, about an eighth of the full speech, contain material directly copied from Wikipedia or superficially modified from its text. Those two paragraphs constitute the entire factual background of the speech, though \u2014 the rest is reaction and proposed policy,\" added Vector.\nExample (identical wording is in \"italics\".):\nMcCain's campaign denies they plagiarized \"Wikipedia\", but also didn't state whether they used it as a source for his speech.\n\"We did not copy Wikipedia in Sen. McCain\u2019s remarks. There are only so many ways to state basic historical facts and dates and that any similarities to \"Wikipedia\" were only coincidental,\" said a spokesman for the McCain campaign, Brian Rogers to \"The Politico\". \"Wikinews\" contacted McCain's campaign, but has yet to receive a response.\n\"Wikinews\" e-mailed Jay Walsh, the director of communications for the Wikimedia Foundation to see what they thought of the situation, and what if anything they planned to do about it.\n\"We aren't particularly concerned with this,\" said Walsh who also added that \"I'm only aware of this situation through media coverage I've seen, nor do we or I have any in-depth detail about the situation.\"\n\"I would say it's a good practice to attribute text or content whenever possible. Obviously when it's a matter of copyright then there are legal considerations, but the Foundation is not able to examine individual cases,\" added Walsh. \"Wikinews\" attempted to contact Mike Godwin, the legal counsel for the Foundation, but has yet to receive a response.\nVector stands by his claim and also notes what he calls 'dishonesty' on the part of McCain's campaign.\n\"What concerns me more, as a voter, is the ethical issue. Plagiarism comes from dishonesty and intellectual laziness on the part of an individual, but McCain's campaign's later denial adopts that individual's dishonesty,\" stated Vector."}

Following the meeting, a press conference was held in which Saakashvili stated that he had signed the accord. But he pointed out that \"this is not a done deal. We need to do our utmost to deter such behaviour in the future.\"\nBy signing the agreement, both sides agree to pull back their forces to pre-conflict positions. The accord allows certain concessions to both Georgia and Russia.\nInitially Medvedev said that he had ordered Russian troops to begin leaving Georgia on August 11. However, the Russian foreign minister refused to put a timetable on the withdrawal of Russian forces from deep inside Georgia and stated that their departure depended on extra security measures being put in place. Lavrov also said Russia would strengthen its contingent in South Ossetia. In a letter to Saakashvili, Nicolas Sarkozy confirmed that according to the signed peace plan, Russian forces are obliged to withdraw from all major Georgian towns regardless of the \"additional security measures\" mentioned in the document. According to Sarkozy, these additional measures refer to the border area only. At the same time Georgian internal affairs ministry reported that Russian forces changed the administrative borders of Abkhazia, and captured one of the Georgian power plants in the area.

It has been claimed that this test flight was used to launch into orbit the Omid, a low earth orbit satellite, however, later reports suggest that a demonstration payload was affixed to the rocket. In addition to uncertainty regarding the rocket's payload, some reports suggest that the rocket reached orbit, whereas others suggest that it intentionally flew a sub-orbital trajectory, similar to two previous test flights. \nIt is believed that if the Omid satellite was not launched on this rocket, it may be launched as early as next week. Upon successful launch, the Omid will be the second Iranian satellite to be placed into orbit, and will be the first to be launched on an indigenously developed rocket. \nThe Safir rocket is believed to be a derivative of the Shahab-3 missile, itself an Iranian-produced derivative of the North Korean Rodong-1 missile. \"Safir\" is Persian for \"envoy\" or \"ambassador\". The launch follows a number of controversial missile tests conducted by Iran during July, and an earlier sub-orbital test of the Safir rocket in February. \nThe details of the launch have yet to be confirmed by independent observers, however, videos have been published online. If the rocket did reached orbit, Iran will be the eleventh country to develop the ability to launch satellites. The last country to develop such a capability was Russia, which used technology inherited from the Soviet Union to launch the Kosmos 2175 spy satellite in 1992. Israel was the last country to develop a completely independent launch system, Shavit, which first flew in 1988. \nOther countries to have developed a satellite launch capability are Russia (and the former Soviet Union), the United States, France, Japan, China, the United Kingdom, India and Israel. It would be the 40th orbital launch so far this year, and the 39th to reach orbit.\nOn August 19, a United States official stated, \"The vehicle failed shortly after liftoff and in no way reached its intended position.\" The video footage shown on Iranian state television was only about one minute and it wasn't shown how far the rocket went upward."}

The forum, moderated by pastor Rick Warren, was scheduled to showcase the candidates to an evangelical segment of the population, who account for 26.3% of the American public.\nDuring the forum the candidates were each individually asked a series of identical questions by the pastor, with Senator Barack Obama going first and Senator John McCain taking his turn second. Senator McCain traveled to the church and waited in a green room while Obama was speaking, and by agreement did not listen to the questions or Senator Obama's responses. On some questions the candidates differed in their interpretations.\nWhen asked whom they believed were the three wisest people to rely on as president, Obama answered that his wife and grandmother were at the top of his list along with a mix of Republican and Democratic Senators. McCain comprised his list of a range of people: the architect of the troop surge in Iraq, General David Petraeus; Democratic Congressman and civil rights leader John Lewis; and the former CEO of eBay, Meg Whitman.\nIn response to being questioned about their toughest decisions in life, Obama answered that deciding to oppose the Iraq War in 2002 was his toughest, while McCain cited his refusal to leave his men behind in a POW camp in Vietnam when given the chance.\nOn some philosophical questions the candidates differed in their moral stances. When asked when they believed individuals should be given human rights, Obama responded that the question was \"above [his] pay grade\" while McCain decisively replied that he believed it should occur \"at the moment of conception.\" On the concept of evil, Obama related it to the situation in Darfur and on America's streets. McCain related it to radical Islamic extremism relaying that he believed evil should be \"defeated.\" He then promised that as president he would hunt Osama bin Laden to the \"gates of hell.\"\nOn a few questions the candidates had similar responses. They both answered that the biggest moral dilemmas in their lives were personal mistakes they had made when they were younger. For Obama, it was his drug use, for McCain it was his failed first marriage.\nBoth candidates were on the stage together briefly between the interviews and shook hands and hugged in a moment symbolic of Warren's call for civility at the beginning and end of the forum."}

Rather, Chaindrawa claims that the government of Georgia is an authoritarian regime that suppresses civil liberties and the freedom of the press, similar to the Russian government policies of Vladimir Putin. Chaindrawa states that Saakashvili tried to close down an independent TV station (Imelda TV), declared a state of emergency in 2007 against mass protests of the opposition, and committed election fraud. Chaindrawa also asserts the politics of Saakashvili's government as a cause of the current war with Russia. He says: \"He wanted a victory parade in Zchinwali and got Russian troops marching toward Tbilisi\".\nWhen asked why he was dismissed from the government in 2006, Chaindrawa stated that he tried to avoid military adventures in the conflict with South Ossetia and that he was highly critical of Saakashvili's failed 2004 attempt to conquer Zchinwali.\nOn the question of what the West should do, Chaindrawa replies that the West should support the Georgian population, its civil society, and its institutions rather than the Saakashvili government. He continues to say that Georgia needs politicians who are pursuing reconciliation and compromise rather than confrontation.\nIn an article in \"The Washington Times\", Tsotne Bakuria, a former member of the Georgian parliament and now a senior fellow at Global International Strategic Group in the U.S., formulates a similarly harsh criticism of Shakasvili's government. She calls its government a \"reign of terror\" and says that the country has no independent judiciary and that Saakashvili uses trumped-up criminal charges (alleged money laundering) to silence and suppress members of the opposition. She describes the leader of the opposition Shalva Natelashvili being forced to ask NATO secretary Javier Solana for asylum for his wife and two daughters after they had received death threats. Natelashvili himself was threatened with arrest by a government member and is facing money laundering charges, as are other members of the opposition."}

But when the family returned home from their second visit, there was a crushing message from his lawyers, \"Abdullah didn't make bail\". \nThe family feels frustrated and says that the court's ruling that Khadr still represents a serious flight risk is unfair. \"None of us have every tried to leave the country\", Zaynab sighs, pointing to Abdullah's co-operation with Canadian authorities since the very beginning.\nAlthough his lawyers proposed a \"stringent supervision plan\" that would have seen the Ottawa-born Khadr living with his grandparents and fitted with an electronic ankle-bracelet to track his whereabouts, the ruling released late Tuesday confirmed that Mr. Justice Gary Trotter was not convinced that Khadr would remain in Canada if released back into the community.\nThe ruling echoes a similar finding made in 2005, when Khadr first applied to be released pending the outcome of his extradition hearing to the United States, where he faces federal conspiracy charges. \nKhadr's lawyers appeared successful in allaying earlier concerns about the insufficient ankle bracelet that would have tracked Khadr's movements in 2005, bringing the owner of Trace Canada, Len Beagley, to testify that \"tremendous developments\" had been made since the courts last heard Khadr's plea for bail in 2005. However, Trotter seemed unconvinced that ankle-bracelets were an \"accepted way of monitoring individuals\", and agreed with Crown arguments that such devices required \"co-operation from the subject\".\nFatmah and Mohammad Elsamnah again offered their $300,000 Toronto home as surety for Khadr's behaviour if released on bail. However, they were judged unacceptable guardians for their grandson, in part due to Mohammad's stuttered and confused responses to questions from the Crown, and his advanced memory loss.\nKhadr's lawyers chose to focus on the recent community support shown at Salaheddin Islamic Centre, where his family prays. In addition to adding $50,000 in collected donations as assurance that the community would keep a close eye on Khadr, the Board of Directors agreed to pay the costs associated with the most advanced system of monitoring ankle-bracelet for Khadr. The manager of the Islamic Centre also offered to employ the 27-year old Khadr, driving him to and from work each day. Crown lawyers Matthew Sullivan and Howard Piafsky challenged the mosque's credibility however, asking RCMP officer Tarek Mokdad to describe the number of worshippers who were later accused of militant action. \nTrotter dismissed claims that the mosque was tied to terrorism, but said the donations from worshippers were unacceptable since they gave the money without expecting to see it returned to them, regardless of Khadr's behaviour.\nThe last to find out about his fate, Abdullah wasn't told the outcome of the hearing until he phoned his family Wednesday evening."}

On Monday, the decision to eliminate bottled water sales in city-run facilities was passed by London's city council with a vote of 15-3 in favour. The move was driven by a desire to reduce waste and shipping, have a lower impact on the environment and promote tap water as a cheap and safe alternative.\nLondon's new restrictions will be implemented over the next several months in buildings that are already equipped with water fountains. Bottled water will still be permitted at many city-run events, such as upcoming summer festivals. Privately-owned retailers will not be affected by the ban.\nOther cities, such as Vancouver, Ottawa and Kitchener, that are already engaged in debate on the issue, may now be watching London carefully for how the ban plays out. Other areas have already begun to phone London with questions on the details of its new regulations. Toronto has begun taking a look at bottled water packaging as part of its waste diversion strategy, and its public school board is looking into the possibility of a total restriction on bottled water sales.\nIn recent years, an awareness of the energy that is required to manufacture, transport and recycle the product has spread nation-wide. Proponents of the ban point to the fact that it can produce as much as 150 times the volume of greenhouse gas when producing bottled water as compared to supplying the same volume of tap water. They also point out that the water that goes into bottled water products is not inspected as frequently as tap water in Canadian cities.\nSome have taken this cause to heart more than others, such as British Environment Minister Phil Woolas, who called the use of bottled water \"morally unacceptable.\" Restaurant critic Giles Coren of The Times of London criticizes those who use the product as \"the new smokers.\"\nCanada's beverage industry has come down with criticism on the increasing opposition to bottled water. Spokesman Scott Tabachnick for Coca-Cola Co., which produces Dasani brand bottled water, commented on the convenience of the product: \"It's hard to bring your kitchen sink with you.\"\nVancouver City Councillor Tim Stevenson thinks that bottled water's time has come and gone: \"Bottled water companies have had a fabulous ride on an unnecessary fad.\" Vancouver officials are still determining how bottled water restrictions, which have been voted for by the City Council, can be phased in.\nNext month, the city is planning to initiate a marketing campaign encouraging Vancouver residents to choose tap water and to remember to carry reusable drinking containers whenever possible.\nRenowned environmental activist Dr. David Suzuki has praised London's decision, saying that it represents a turning point for people's perceptions on the issue: \"I'm really delighted that London has done this because it really makes us focus on some fundamental issues.\" He hopes that someday people will \"look at anyone who hauls out a bottle of water and say, 'What the hell's wrong with you?'\""}

Rescuers used helicopters and dogs to search for survivors for a day, but failed to find any.\n\"[I saw] a wall of ice coming towards us and then we were carried 200 metres,\" said one of the survivors from Italy, Marco Delfini who also said he tried to help the others caught in the snow.\nThere have been many accidents in the Alps this summer, about one hundred climbers have perished since June 1 in France, Italy and Switzerland altogether, of whom about twenty have died on Mont Blanc.

The investigation also found that Obama's campaign staff seems to be removing questionable edits more often than they are making them. McCain's campaign staff in most cases is removing unflattering information in certain articles. \nWhile using the online internet tool Wikiscanner, \"Wikinews\" was able to determine the Internet Protocol Address range for the campaign headquarters for Obama, Obama For America and McCain, mccain08hq.com. After determining the ranges, Wikinews found the individual IP addresses used to edit \"Wikipedia\" and cross referenced them to current edits as early as August of this year for both campaigns.\nAs early as August 1, a staff member from McCain's campaign using the IP address 12.47.124.18 edited a \"Wikipedia\" article titled: Xenophobia, in which the staff member removed a paragraph of information stating that \"North America has had a current of xenophobia against black people, especially in the United States.\" On November 2, 2007, a staff member using the same address removed information that criticized Liberty University. Staff members also performed other edits on articles that favor McCain which can be considered a conflict of interest. \nObama's campaign staff was also participating in editing. One staff member using the IP address 208.116.214.66 apparently did not like Vanilla Ice saying on May 31, 2007, \"Most recently, Winkle was the target of an unfortunate assault when, during a concert in Des Moines, Iowa, an Aryan-looking, bi-curious campaign staffer named Tom Vietor hurled an empty bottle at the performer's skull.\" The edit was immediately removed by the same IP address. Vietor's last registered salary was in April of 2007. On August 6, 2007 another staff member using a different IP address from Obama's campaign, 208.116.214.67, added \"Adam Goldfarb is the biggest liar I know\" to the \"Wikipedia\" article Liar. Goldfarb is listed as being on the New Jersey staff for Obama's campaign. Later more recent edits from 208.116.214.66 appear to remove vandalism from articles on \"Wikipedia\" while the other stopped editing thereafter.\nThese edits come just days after a \"Wikipedia\" editor alleged the McCain campaign lifted background information from \"Wikipedia\" for an August 11 public speech about the Georgian-Russian crisis. McCain gave a warning to Russia stating, \"Russian President Medvedev and Prime Minister Putin must understand the severe, long-term negative consequences that their government\u2019s actions will have for Russia\u2019s relationship with the U.S. and Europe.\"\nThis discovery occurred at the beginning of the 2008 Democratic National Convention which began on Monday in Denver, Colorado where Obama is accepting his nomination for the presidential bid.\n\"Wikinews\" has e-mailed both campaigns, but as of publishing this report, there have been no responses."}

The study finds that as of 2005, there are 1.4 billion people who are living for less than US$1.25 per day. This is down from 1.9 billion in 1981, which equals half of the population in the developing world. However, the new numbers have vastly increased from previous estimates. According to last estimate based on data from 1994, it was believed that there were only 985 million people in poverty in 2004 and 1.5 billion in 1981. \nAccording to one of the report's authors Martin Ravallion, Director of the Development Research Group at the World Bank, \"The new estimates are a major advance in poverty measurement because they are based on far better price data for assuring that the poverty lines are comparable across countries. Data from household surveys have also improved in terms of country coverage, data access, and timeliness.\"\nThe report concludes that the developing world is on track to meet its goal to cut poverty in half by 2015. However, drops in poverty will not be consistent worldwide. \nEast Asia has seen the biggest drop in poverty since 1981 when 80% of the population was poor. Currently, it's just 18%. South Asia has seen a drop of 20%, however the number of people in poverty has stayed the same due to an increase in population. \nIn India, for example, poverty at $1.25 a day increased from 420 million people in 1981 to 455 million in 2005. However, due to population growth, the poverty rate as a share of the total population dropped to 42% in 2005 from 60% in 1981.\nThe only region that has not seen any significant decrease in poverty is Sub-Saharan Africa where the percentage of people in poverty has stayed the same at 50%. Due to population increase, the number of people have nearly doubled to 380 million. \n\"The new data confirm that the world will likely reach the first Millennium Development Goal of halving the 1990 level of poverty by 2015 and that poverty has fallen by about one percentage point a year since 1981,\" said Justin Lin, Chief Economist and Senior Vice President, Development Economics at the World Bank.\n\"However, the sobering news that poverty is more pervasive than we thought means we must redouble our efforts, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa,\" added Lin.\nThe report, \"The Developing World Is Poorer Than We Thought, But No Less Successful in the Fight against Poverty\" by Shaohua Chen and Martin Ravallion, is based on data from 2005.

The claims have surfaced following police being alerted in August last year.\nPolice have appealed for victims to come forward, but acknowledged it may be difficult for some. \"I would imagine it would be very hard for anyone subject to these sort of things to come forward,\" Detective Superintendent Michael Goodwin said. \"All I can say is that NSW police force will be providing every form of support we possibly can to make the process for them as trouble-free as possible.\" \nSuperintendent Goodwin reassured the community that the allegations date back two decades and there is \"absolutely no suggestion whatsoever that the college involved is/has been looking to anything in the current day.\"\n\"The college involved has been cooperating with the police completely with this inquiry,\" Goodwin added.\nThe police would not release how many suspects were being investigated but said their inquiries had not led them to any other locations where former staff may have been employed.

He faced Bathurst Local Court in July, facing 33 separate charges including six counts of sexual intercourse with pupils aged 10 and 18.\nSpillane's lawyer, Greg Walsh, says media reports alerted him to the new claims.\n\"I don't know anything about eight alleged other victims, I've not been served with any witness statements so I really can't comment about it,\" said Walsh.\nOne former student described the alleged abuse as \"an orgy\", claiming that boys were herded into a prayer room by a priest chanting \"hypnotic\" spells in tongues. It is alleged that boys were subject to sexual abuse or forced to assault each other once in the prayer room.\nA former border told \"The Daily Telegraph\" that priests \"got a group between eight and 12 of us together and they'd just start chanting and I would wake up during these sessions and see what was going on.\"\nThe allegations came to light after one of the alleged victims made a visit to Bathurst last year to hand out fliers documenting the abuse and providing a link to his website address. The school called in police, who the victim claims contacted him and asked him to make a complaint."}

The Associated Press reported that police charging documents state that Queen Antoinette instructed her followers to pray for Javon Thompson to be resurrected while he lay dead in the back room of the Baltimore apartment. An informant told police Queen Antoinette left Javon Thompson's body in the back room of the apartment for over a week, and told her followers: \"God was going to raise Javon from the dead\".\nRamkissoon's mother and her attorney assert that she was brainwashed by the 1 Mind Ministries group and acted under the control of Queen Antoinette. \"The members of this cult, who were more than twice her age, were calling the shots,\" said Ramkissoon's attorney Steven Silverman at a court hearing for his client. Inside the group, Ria Ramkissoon referred to herself as \"Princess Marie\".\nCourt documents revealed that 1 Mind Ministries conducted operations in secret, did not believe in medical care and dressed in all-white clothing. Members of the group were referred to as \"princes\" and \"princesses\" by Queen Antoinette, also known as Toni Sloan or Toni Ellsberry. Documents also state that they viewed Javon Thompson as a \"demon\" for not saying \"amen\" after meals, that they stopped feeding him in December 2006, and did not seek out medical attention when the boy stopped breathing and died.\nRick A. Ross of \"The Ross Institute Internet Archives for the Study of Destructive Cults, Controversial Groups and Movements\" spoke with the Associated Press about the nature of the 1 Mind Ministries group, and asserted that it meets the definition of a \"cult\". Ross has given expert testimony in cases related to controversial groups and has studied them for 26 years. Law enforcement officials also used the term to describe the 1 Mind Ministries group, specifically characterizing it as a \"Christian fundamentalist cult\".\n\"It fits the profile of a classic cult in the sense that it's a personality-driven group and that Queen Antoinette is that animating personality and central defining element of the group,\" said Ross. He compared the group to others where children were killed because they did not follow the instructions of the group. \"The Ross Institute Internet Archives\" maintains a page about 1 Mind Ministries, which contains archived news articles, a photo of Queen Antoinette, and links to other resources.\nProsecutors in the murder case have also referred to the 1 Mind Ministries group as a \"cult\", and said that members of the group would likely follow Queen Antoinette's instructions during the trial. In a hearing August 13 where Queen Antoinette and group member Trevia Williams, 21, were denied bail, they both also refused legal representation from Baltimore public defenders, and both declined a preliminary hearing. \"Chances are, the cult members are going to do what she tells them to do,\" said Baltimore Assistant State's Attorney David C. Chiu at the court proceeding. Ria Ramkissoon is being held in the psychiatric unit of a city jail in Baltimore, Queen Antoinette, Trevia Williams and group member Marcus Cobbs are also being held in jail in Baltimore, and federal officials in New York from the United States Marshals Service are searching for another member of the group.\nRev. Anna V. Nelson spoke to the family at the memorial service in Baltimore, saying: \"I would like to think that this boy died for us. This baby has left a message here for the whole world. This baby died so that they [1 Mind Ministries] could be exposed.\" \nThe memorial service ended with a presentation of video clips of Javon Thompson playing, being held by his mother, and finally watching the camera as a female voice says goodbye to him.

The agency originally planned to retire all shuttles in 2010 after mission STS-134, but concerns over staff job losses that were created by the Space Shuttle program caused Griffin to order the study. The space crafts have been in use since 1981 and it's replacements, the Ares rockets, will not be in use until 2015 causing a 5 year gap where NASA will have no manned space flights, which is the reason the agency is considering extending usage for five more years, when the vehicles can be immediately replaced by their successors.\nThe news came from a leaked email which was obtained from the Los Angeles Times. NASA officials have confirmed the email's authenticity, but have stated that it is too early to decide whether or not the shuttle use will continue.\nGriffin has originally been against the continuation of the shuttle, as it would damage the funding of Project Constellation, a project that involves sending astronauts to the Moon and Mars.\nIf NASA chooses not to continue the space shuttle, they would rely on the Russian Federal Space Agency and their Soyuz space vehicles in the five year gap of no American space flights. To do this, they would have to purchase seats on Soyuz missions. However, because of the recent events that have transpired over the Georgia conflict, US and Russian relations have been damaged, so it is believed unwise to work with the Russian agency."}

At a press conference held from 9:30 p.m. Fukuda stated that he decided to resign, thinking the government should implement policies with a new line-up. The cabinet will resign en masse and a new prime minister will be designated. Before that, the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) will elect a new President. \nSince the July 2007 election (to replace half the members) in the upper house, the ruling bloc (LDP and New Komeito) has been minority, while being overwhelming majority in the lower house since the 2005 General Election. Fukuda took over Shinzo Abe as a LDP President, and became Japan's Prime Minister on September 26, 2007. \nSurprise announcement.\nAt the Monday conference Fukuda, age 72, noted that some matters important to people's life should be deliberated in the upcoming extraordinary Diet session, such as a supplementary budget and a draft to set up a new agency of consumer affairs. Fukuda criticized the main opposition Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) for uncooperativeness in the annual Diet session (earlier this year) with tactics to delay deliberations. Fukuda said he thought the government must be well ready formed to attend the upcoming Diet session. \nFukuda's predecessor Shinzo Abe also suddenly showed resignation last year, later confessing his health problems. Questioned about the similarity, Fukuda replied he had no particular health problem except his poorer eyesight, and emphasized he considered how the course of politics should be before he made this decision. \nFukuda's announcement came half a day after Ichiro Ozawa, the President of the main opposition DPJ, expressed his will to seek a third term.\nEarly resignation.\nAfter hosting Hokkaid\u014d T\u014dyako Summit in July, Fukuda reshuffled his cabinet on August 2. At the Monday conference Fukuda was questioned about his view on this early resignation, and Fukuda replied it was natural he was asked why. Fukuda continued that at the time of the reshuffle he had eagerness at least for important matters, those on economy in particular, and he thought they were settled by the last weekend, somehow or other. Fukuda explained he changed his mind, taking into account various political situations of this one month, with hope for the upcoming Diet session to be run smoothly. \nNow it's clear Fukuda won't choose dissolution of the lower house. Japan's next lower house General Election should be held no later than September, 2009. \nFukuda's self-appraisal.\nLooking back on his 11 months, Fukuda said he undertook the job last September knowing there lay difficulties in his way, after the ruling bloc lost majority in the upper house as a result of the July 2007 election. Fukuda said he was very busy from the beginning handling longstanding problems that surfaced one after another, including the issue of mismatched or lost pension records and the scandals as to the Ministry of Defense. Fukuda noted that he, despite such troubles, maybe not outstandingly, put his hand to some reforms from the public perspective, such as generalization of the revenue earmarked for roadways affairs, draft-making for a new consumer agency, drastic review of social security systems.\nReactions.\nBelow are reactions of Japanese politicians shown on the Monday night."}

The Government has stood up and said we are sorry.

The Prime Minister met with Governor General Micha\u00eblle Jean at her official residence of Rideau Hall today to request that the 39th Parliament of Canada be dissolved. The Queen's representative agreed to drop the writ and hold the election on Harper's recommended date.\nThroughout the duration of Harper's minority parliament, there have been several times where an election call had been predicted, but it managed to survive longer than any true minority government in Canadian history, despite having the smallest relative caucus. Nevertheless, today's announcement has been a near-certainty for the past week, and each party has already begun campaigning and putting up signs. The Conservatives began airing TV advertisements before the official election call was made.\nAfter meeting individually with the leaders of the three other parties represented in the House of Commons, Harper said that he does not have confidence in the ability of the Parliament to continue to work. After each of his meetings at 24 Sussex Drive, opposition leaders emerged saying that Harper was intent on calling an election and had already decided that there could be no common ground with opposition parties. Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois leader Gilles Duceppe said after his August 29 meeting with the Prime Minister that \"instead of making efforts to try finding solutions in the best interest of the population, he wants an election in the best interest of his party\". Over the course of this past Parliament, the governing Conservatives rarely found compromises with the other parties, and his small caucus has survived largely because the Liberal Party chose to abstain from crucial bills rather than vote against them.\nThe move is somewhat unusual. While minority governments rarely last long in Canada a request for the dissolution of Parliament is normally not made until the government is defeated on a motion of confidence by the opposition parties. The move is also unusual because it appears to violate a law passed by Harper himself; Bill C-16 of the first session set fixed election dates for federal elections, reading \"each general election must be held on the third Monday of October in the fourth calendar year following polling day for the last general election\". Under the law, the next election was not to be held until October 19, 2009; however, the government has stated that the bill was never intended to be used in minority parliaments. Harper argues, however, that the parliament could no longer function and opposition parties intended to defeat the government. With that rationale, Governor General Jean had little choice but to follow her prime minister's advice.\nA recent poll conducted by Ipsos Reid for CanWest News Service reported that half of all the 1,003 Canadians surveyed said Harper would make the best Prime Minister, with New Democratic Party leader Jack Layton at 31%, and Liberal Leader St\u00e9phane Dion at 20%. NDP leader Jack Layton is at 38% support for being \"sincerely committed to dealing with global warming,\" with Dion at 30%, and Harper last at 27%. \"If this election is going to be a referendum on leadership, Stephen Harper has a heck of an advantage,\" says Ipsos Reid president Darrell Bricker. He also says Dion has to \"to rough up Stephen Harper a bit\" if he wants to win the election.\nHarper is also at 50% for being the best to lead in tough economic times, 47% for having \"what is takes\" to lead the country, and 43% for \"a vision of Canada that you can support.\"\nThe Conservatives currently hold 127 of the 308 seats in the House of Commons, up from 124 at the last election, while the Liberals hold 95 seats, down from 103. Recent polls show the Conservatives polling at 37% support among voters, just below the 40% usually required to form a majority government. "}

There have been doubts over how thoroughly McCain had examined Palin's background before announcing that he had selected her to be his running mate on August 29. McCain's advisers insist that Palin was \"thoroughly vetted,\" a process that would have included a review of all financial and legal records as well as a criminal background check.\nPalin is the Republican Party's first female candidate for . In 1984, was 's running mate on the Democratic Party ticket.\nYesterday, Palin and her husband issued a statement saying that their 17-year-old unmarried daughter Bristol is five months pregnant and that she intends to marry the father of the baby. The statement came after media speculation and internet rumours that Palin's 4-month-old son, Trig, was in fact her grandson, and that the mother is Bristol.\nSenator Barack Obama, McCain's opponent in the 2008 election, was asked to comment on Palin's family situation:\n\"Let me be as clear as possible... I think people's families are off-limits, and people's children are especially off-limits. This shouldn't be part of our politics. It has no relevance to Governor Palin's performance as governor or her potential performance as a vice president,\" said Obama.\nObama further told reporters to \"back off these kinds of stories\" and noted that he was born to an 18-year-old mother himself. Obama became annoyed when asked about a news report that quoted an unnamed senior McCain campaign aide saying that Obama's name appears in liberal blogs speculating about Trig's parentage. \"I am offended by that statement... There is no evidence at all that any of this involved us.\"\n\"We don't go after people's families; we don't get them involved in the politics. It's not appropriate, and it's not relevant,\" Obama added. \"Our people were not involved in any way in this, and they will not be. And if I ever thought that there was somebody in my campaign that was involved in something like that, they'd be fired.\"\nThe said that Senator McCain was aware of Bristol Palin's pregnancy before he asked her mother to join him on the ticket. McCain reportedly did not see the pregnancy as a detriment to Governor Palin's selection as the vice presidential candidate.\nMcCain told reporters that he was satisfied with his campaign's vetting process: \"The vetting process was completely thorough and I'm grateful for the results.\"\nGovernor Palin has hired a private lawyer in a legislative ethics investigation in Alaska into whether she abused her power in , Walter Monegan. The investigation is checking into whether Palin dismissed Monegan for his reluctance to fire Palin's former , Mike Wooten.\nThere is no sign that Palin's formal nomination this week at the was in jeopardy. The controversy adds anxiety to Republicans who are worried that Democrats would use the selection of Palin to question McCain's judgment. Republicans were quick to note that Palin has \"more executive experience\" in elected office than does Obama and have gone on the offensive.\nMcCain's choice of Palin came as a shock to some, after it was expected that McCain would choose , , or for the vice presidential nomination. McCain had reportedly met Palin only twice before her selection, and had his first face-to-face interview with her on August 28. McCain offered Palin the vice presidential spot just moments after their meeting concluded. The two appeared at a campaign rally event the following morning in Dayton, Ohio."}

The reshuffle was prompted by the resignation of Deputy Premier John Watkins and the sackings of Treasurer Michael Costa and Health Minister Reba Meagher.\nThe political fallout follows the botched attempt to privatise the state's electricity industry.\nThe right of the Labor party was presented with a list of colleagues who the Premier wanted in and out of his reshuffled cabinet. MPs were frustrated that Joe Tripodi was not on the our list. MPs rejected Iemma's list and demanded the chance to vote upon it. Mr Iemma then told the faction that unless they accepted his cabinet he would resign. Caucus called Iemma's bluff and said Iemma had lost support of the party.\nThe party then looked to the left-wing faction of the party and Nathan Rees was appointed unanimously and unopposed, Carmel Tebbutt was appointed as the state's deputy premier. \nIt is the first time in 117 years that a Premier has lost support of his own party and the first time in NSW Labor history that the party has been led by a member from the left.\nSpeaking to the media, Mr Iemma said he could not lead a cabinet that was not of his own choosing.\n\"I took what I believed to be a package of renewal, reform and refreshment, for the party, the Cabinet.

The Boeing 777-ER crashed early this year as it tried to land at London's Heathrow Airport.\nThe report states that the AAIB believes the crash occurred when ice crystals formed within the fuel system. However, it should be noted that the report only serves as an update into the progress of the investigation and that the final report is yet to be published and may yet reach a different conclusion into the cause of the accident.\nThe flight from Beijing, China had been normal until final approach at Heathrow, at which point the aircraft was coming in for landing with the autopilot and autothrottle engaged. However, engine power became greatly reduced when the autothrottle requested more thrust, and the aircraft made a forced landing 1,000 feet from the runway. The aircraft suffered substantial damage as it slid across the grass to the runway threshold, where it came to rest, and was written off. There was only one serious injury and eight minor ones to the 136 passengers and 16 crew.\nAs the jet passed over Siberia it encountered significantly reduced temperatures. The AAIB has determined that the fuel was at a temperature below 0\u00b0C for an unusually long duration. This is believed to have caused water in the fuel - which met all relevant international standards - to have frozen into crystals. These were able to form undetected as the aircraft cruised with a low fuel requirement, and it was only when extra fuel was pumped in from the tanks for the landing that the crystals became a problem.\nThe report says that the current explanation being offered for the accident is an \"apparently hitherto unknown phenomenon\" and warns that other combinations of aircraft models and engines may also be vulnerable. The 777 involved was powered by Rolls-Royce Trent 800s, like 222 of the 736 777s currently operating. Data from 141,000 other flights of such aircraft has not yielded any other set of circumstances similar to the one in the crash flight.\nIn light of these results, a worldwide alert has been issued to the 11 airlines that between them operate all the aircraft identical to the lost jet. Boeing have instructed airlines to vary altitude regularly when fuel is below 10\u00b0C and to run the engines at max power for ten seconds before attempting a landing if the fuel has been at such temperatures for over three hours. The extra power is intended to clear out any buildup of water. To prevent buildup of water during ground operation at freezing temperatures all fuel pumps should be run at full power for one minute.\nAir New Zealand have already confirmed they will introduce the new measures, and United States authorities are expected to make them mandatory within days. The affected aircraft are operated by US carriers American Airlines and Delta Air Lines."}

Upon further investigation, \"Wikinews\" found that most videos and clips were added to \"YouTube\" by the copyright holders of the material; as DMCA requests are for the purposes of requesting removal where service providers host material that infringe on the copyright of the complainant, the merit of these requests remain questionable. It was also discovered that the alleged rights group does not exist as a physical entity. In an in-depth report, \"Wikinews\" investigated the incident and obtained exclusive information and comments from individuals, including \"XenuTV\" producer .\nWithin the past 24 hours, according to the EFF, the Counsel \"sent out over 4000 DMCA takedown notices to YouTube, all making copyright infringement claims against videos with content critical of the Church of Scientology.\" A DMCA notice, or Digital Millennium Copyright Act notice means an attempt to limit the use of copyrighted material that is often infringing on the rights of an alleged copyright.\n\"Wikinews\" made attempts to contact American Rights Counsel LLC for comment on the take-down notices, but was unable to obtain contact details for the alleged organisation. One post on a \"YouTube\" discussion page related to the organization states that they \"do not appear to exist outside of these claims on YouTube.\" \"Wikinews\" contacted \"YouTube\" several times asking them if they have a process of verifying DMCA requests from individuals or entities claiming copyright infringement, but when they responded, they directed \"Wikinews\" to their terms of service saying, \"item 8 addresses the DMCA and 8 B addresses counter-notice procedures.\"\n\"YouTube's\" terms of use in regards to filing DMCA requests states that only \"A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed\" can make such claims. It also goes on to say, \"Identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed, or, if multiple copyrighted works at a single online site are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works at that site.\"\nThe EFF says the videos attempting to be removed had shown clips from \"Anonymous\" protests of the Church and news footage from Australia and Germany which were critical of Scientology. Some videos were also messages from \"Anonymous\" to Scientology, and vice versa. Others were also video clips from a City Commission meeting in , Florida. Accounts hosting the material were \"suspended by YouTube in response to multiple allegations of copyright infringement.\"\nYouTube does, however, have a process for users that wish to file a counter-notice against a take-down under the DMCA. After the DMCA notices were sent, \"YouTube\" users began to revolt, by sending \"DMCA counter-notices\" to \"YouTube\". The EFF states that the counter attack resulted in many of the accounts being reinstated and their videos restored.\nOne user claimed that he had shot and uploaded one of the videos that was taken down. \"How can someone else file a claim against a video I MADE?,\" said ShadowVsScientology, one of the \"YouTube\" users who had a video deleted. Since he owned the rights to the video, he alleges that the American Rights Counsel had no legal grounds to request its removal.\nA video posted on \"YouTube\" by a user called 'Church0fScientology', who was responsible for the original 'Message to Scientology' in January of 2008 created after the Church had a video of a Tom Cruise interview removed from the site, states that the organization responsible for the DMCAs does not exist and is run by a man named Dr. Oliver Schaper. They state that he \"fronts\" the organization for Scientology. It also calls Schaper's actions \"deceptive\". Schaper also had an account on \"YouTube\" which has since been suspended. \"Wikinews\" obtained a cached version of his account page in which he states to the group \"Anonymous\", \"I respect your efforts as long your efforts remain within the limits of the law and remain fair. Although I don't censor any postings, I would appreciate if any conversation could remain civil and insult free.\" Schaper also states that he \"will not censor because I strongly believe in the freedom of speech.\" They accuse him of running and owning media companies that distribute gay pornography, something Schaper later admits, but only that it's an \"adult television network.\" Homosexuality is not accepted within the Church of Scientology and is not tolerated.

This included postings made by HouseSpiderAnon on his videos, who publicly connected the dots and made them available to a larger audience.\"\n\"I requested several times to have my information removed from his videos as I wanted no association with his work but he refused, even after I stated several times that he has the right to protest but that I would like to enforce my right of privacy. He refused and demanded documentation of the attacks, something I refused because it was not my attention to allow more documents to be available online in public hand,\" added Schaper who also said he has been a victim of identity theft and now has the FBI involved in investigating his claim.\n\"Tustin PD [police department] has been on the case and now the FBI is involved as well. Social Security has been notified and we have seen about 200 attempts to use the SSN [social security number] for fake credit cards applications,\" Schaper told \"Wikinews\".\nSchaper admits that he contacted \"YouTube\" to have videos which contained images of him that were being used without permission and videos \"which violated [his] privacy removed.\" Those requests made by Schaper were eventually accepted by \"YouTube\" but \"videos that contained just a text messages directed against me or my church remained,\" he added. He also admits to owning \"several broadcasting companies, ACOS Broadcasting Corp. (eight mainstream television and two radio networks) &amp; Media House Enterprises, Inc. (adult television network PEEPHOLE TV).\"\n\"I had the power to go fully against copyrighted material because we own or licensed large amounts of content. But it was not my responsibility to enforce all copyright violations on YouTube. In addition with the attacks on our servers, websites and infrastructure, no time would have been available to take on a fight,\" added Schaper.\nSchaper also denies any involvement with the alleged rights group and also states he was just notified that it doesn't even exist.\n\"As many other people, and even members of the Church of Scientology received information about a company that removed anti-Scientology content from YouTube, shit hit the fan and members of Anonymous went on a full attack on me. I still have to this date no information about the American Rights Counsel and I have no connection, knowledge or involvement in this company which I have been informed of does not even exists,\" Schaper told \"Wikinews\".\nOne critic of Scientology, television producer Mark Bunker also had his accounts deleted by \"YouTube\", but had them quickly restored. Bunker also believes that the American Rights Counsel does not exist.\n\"American Rights Counsel LLC does not exist. When I got my take-down notices from YouTube I tried to file a DMCA counter-notice but in order to do that you need to get the name of the contact person to be served with the notice and the contact information of the company which the government lists on the web,\" said Bunker to \"Wikinews\" who also added that their name is not registered with the United States copyright office.\n\"I next did a google search for American Rights Counsel LLC which brought up absolutely no results so clearly this was fraud from the beginning. I contact[ed] YouTube and they quickly restored everything to my account and others,\" added Bunker.\n\"Wikinews\" has also learned that a contributor on Wikipedia, claiming to be a member of \"Anonymous\", has posted what is allegedly personal information of Schaper. The edit, made to the article Peephole TV states that he is a lawyer, employed with a firm on Ricklinger, Stadtweg in , Germany. It also stated that he is affiliated with the \"Tustin Org\" in California. In what seems to be a gathering of information on Schaper from other online sources, according to \"Enturbulation.org\", the result of releasing the information has resulted in legal and physical threats from Schaper to someone, known as 'HouseSpiderV2' on \"Enturbulation\", who has claimed to have released e-mail correspondence between him and Schaper.\n\"Don't think I will not be able to track you down and serve you with papers. I would make the case so expensive for you that you would not be able to even fight this on your own funding as I have the money at my disposal,\" allegedly states Schaper to 'HouseSpiderV2' in an e-mail. \"You have 24 hours to remove the postings or I will start to make this a legal issue. That makes it simple,\" he added.\nDespite the claims that the Wikipedia contributor is Oliver Schaper, he claims to have never registered an account with Wikipedia. He also says he has never made any threats of physical harm to members of \"Anonymous\".\n\"I had not the need to register an account with Wikipedia and after all this trouble will not get involved at all. There has never been any threat of violence against Housespideranon or any other member of Anonymous made by me,\" Schaper told \"Wikinews\".\nBunker, who recently spoke with Schaper, says he believes Schaper is not involved, but that he also doesn't know who or what was responsible for filing the DMCA requests.\n\"I had never heard of Schaper before he was accused of this. I don't know anything about him other than he contacted me and said he was not involved. I don't know who was responsible. 4000 deletions in a matter of hours is a pretty major feat. It would be worth a subpoena to find out who committed this crime. I wouldn't blame Schaper without knowing he did it,\" Bunker added."}

While 900,000 people were evacuated by rescue workers, new data has revealed that 50,000 people, from the town of Saharsa, have refused to leave their homes.\nAdvertisements in local newspapers have been used to encourage the people who are still remaining in the area to leave soon. People are encouraged to go to one of many camps, which are funded by the government, to seek refuge from the continued flooding.\nPeople have also started to return to their homes, due to the fact that they have seen the water level drop by over half of a metre in some areas. This is despite statements by officials emphasizing that people may need to stay in the camps for up to six months.\nApproximately 1.2 million people are estimated to have had their homes flooded by the disaster. 42 people have been confirmed dead, although \"The Australian\" has reported that the actual death toll is likely to be much higher.\nThe incident started when gushing waters quickly overflowed the channel boundaries on both sides at a rate of about 200 meters per day, flooding vast tracts in Supaul, Araria, Saharsa, Madhepura, Purnia, Katihar, parts of Khagaria and northern parts of Bhagalpur, as well as adjoining regions of Nepal. About 2.7 million people are affected by this flood disaster of massive dimensions, with about 900,000 people in the affected areas having moved to 285 relief camps and 249 health centers. An estimated 100,000 are still trapped in various villages without food or drinking water since several days ago when the crisis began.\nDuring the last 250 years, the Kosi has moved its path up to 150km westward on multiple occasions, leaving behind a series of paleochannels. The river is a tributary of the Ganges, with catchment areas in the Nepal Himalayas, one of the fastest rising mountain chains, flowing through a 150-kilometer wide and 180-kilometer long alluvial fan. Fast silting of the channels by the tons of annuvium brought down by the river makes it drift off so often that it is often cited as one of the text book examples of a dynamic river system to geologists."}

The 450-seat widebodied jetliner will have 25 rooms sleeping a total of 85 people, including some in a luxury suite in the cockpit, and will sit at the entrance to Stockholm-Arlanda Airport.\nBuilt in 1976, the aircraft was an \"old wreck\" when acquired, according to Oscar. The aircraft was being offered for sale at Stolkholm-Arlanda after previous owner Transjet became bankrupt. The airframe has then been completely gutted and is being fitted with a new, modernised interior. Each room contains three bunk beds. A cafe and a walkway across the left wing are also featured.\nThe airliner will sit on a concrete platform at the airport's entrance, with its landing gear secured in steel cradles. It is intended to offer a good view of the day-to-day operation of the airport.\nThe hostel, which is to open in December, is aimed at families with children, aviation enthusiasts, low-budget travelers and people catching early morning flights who wish to leave it as late as possible before rising to get to check-in - unlike its competitors, the Jumbo Hostel is ten minutes walk from the check-in desks. \nWikinews conducted an email interview with Oscar Di\u00f6s to talk about the hostel.

Page died in her sleep early Saturday morning at her home in Los Angeles, said actor Randal Malone, her longtime friend.\nPage was born Anita Pomeres on August 4, 1910 in Flushing, New York. She was the leading lady to Lon Chaney, Buster Keaton, Robert Montgomery, and Clark Gable (among others), and during the early 1930s was one of Hollywood's busiest actresses, as well as being romantically involved with Gable. At the height of her popularity, she was receiving more fan mail than any other female star, with the exception of Greta Garbo, and received multiple marriage proposals from Italian Prime Minister Benito Mussolini in the mail.\nPage entered film first with \"A Kiss For Cinderella\" in 1925. She and her family were very close to Betty Bronson's family, and she was offered the part through Betty. After a few small but well received parts, she was offered a contract with MGM Studios. MGM molded her into one of their biggest female stars of the silent era, pairing her with such popular actors as Ramon Novarro and William Haines. Her performances in \"Our Dancing Daughters\" (1928) opposite Joan Crawford (with whom she appeared in three films), and \"The Broadway Melody\" (1929) opposite Bessie Love were her greatest successes of the period, and her popularity allowed her to make a smooth transition into talking pictures.\nPage stopped acting when she fell in love with US Navy aviator Herschel House. The couple married in 1936, six weeks after they met, and she settled down to life as an officer's wife, hosting many parties at their home in San Diego Bay. \nAfter House died in 1991, Page returned to acting, starring in suspense thriller \"Sunset After Dark\" in 1994. \nHer last film appearance came in Frankenstein Rising, a horror due for release later this year.

The Greenberg Traurig lobbying company, which also employed Abramoff, gave $1000 to Team Sununu on December 16, 2002 for purposes of 'debt retirement.'\nAccording to a report by the U.S. Senate Indian Affairs Committee, Jack Abramoff commonly told Native American tribal clients to divert their funds through the Alexander Strategies Group. Earlier that October, Jack Abramoff had met with the legislative director of the Saginaw Chippewa tribe in Michigan. Representative John Sununu, now a sitting senator from New Hampshire, had served on the Appropriations Committee that helped draft the Department of Interior funding bill. In the section on Native American water claims, land claims, and miscellaneous payments, over $6,000,000 in funding was given to Michigan fishing in the Great Lakes.\nThe event occurred a day before the presentation of a Department of Interior funding bill to President George W. Bush for signing, and a week after the conference report settling differences between the House and the Senate. Abramoff wrote to fellow lobbyist Michael Scanlon on October 4, 2001 via e-mail, \"I had dinner tonight with Chris Petras of Sag Chip. He was salivating at the $4-5 million program I described to him (is that enough? Probably not).\"\nJack Abramoff was sentenced to four years in federal prison earlier this month. He had admitted to conspiring to defraud four Native American tribes that either operated or were interested in operating casinos.

Thomas Smith, Jr., who had served as the Alexander Strategy Group's lawyer.\nThe Alexander Strategy Group was shut down in January due to ties with Jack Abramoff and former House majority leader Tom DeLay. The Rely On Your Beliefs Fund, owned by former Rep. Roy Blunt, has already donated to charity $8,500 equivalent to the amount personally contributed by Jack Abramoff in 2006. In November 2004, Gannett News Service had reported that Abromoff directed the Tigua tribe to contribute to the Rely On Your Beliefs Fund.

After a few months passed, the woman said she felt like she was being scammed. Following several complaints from other unnamed individuals and an investigation, judge Jean-Christophe Hullin ordered at least two Scientology departments and the seven Scientologists to be put on trial for fraud and \"illegally practicing as pharmacists.\"\nThe Church released a statement following the order saying that they felt \"stigmatized\" by the French judicial system.\n\"The special treatment reserved for the Church of Scientology Celebrity Center raises questions about the equality of the justice system and the presumption of innocence,\" the Church said in a statement to the press.\nThe AFP says the case is to be heard at an unknown date, and will also include an investigation by France's association for prescription drugs.

The model predicts that Higgs boson particles gives mass to all fundamental particles and explains the existence of dark matter, or invisible matter in between galaxies. \nThe LHC is a 27 kilometer long circular high energy particle accelerator which took more than 20 years and USD $9 billion to build. In the next few weeks the machine will collide opposing beams of protons charged with approximately 7 TeV of energy resulting in cataclysmic conditions that will mimic the beginning of time, a re-creation of the Big Bang.\nAn upgraded version of the LHC was announced, nicknamed the \"super LHC\". The new accelerator will perform ten times the number of collisions as the current LHC over the same time. The upgrade will feature a new injection system and enhanced detectors to cope with the increase in data packets from collisions.\nThe bigger International Linear Collider, nicknamed \"Einstein's telescope\", is planned by the International Technology Recommendation Panel (ITRP). The ILC will have a collision energy of 500 GeV and will collide electrons with particles of antimatter, called positrons, along a 30-40 km completely straight tunnel. The ILC's two giant \"guns\" pointing at each other would be able to accelerate electrons and positrons to near-light speeds before smashing them together. \n\"The LHC smashes protons together to discover new particles but also generates lots of debris that obscures the fine detail. The ILC would be a much cleaner machine and tell us far more about their real nature.\" says Brian Foster, professor of experimental physics at Oxford University and European director of the project. The host country for the ILC has not yet been chosen but it is planned to have the machine constructed by late 2010. The new machine will cost an estimated USD $7 billion to build. Physicists hope that ILC might be able to resolve some of the questions raised by Einstein's theories of relativity. \nSources.\n "}

The collision occurred on Friday at about 4:25pm PDT on Metrolink's Ventura County Line. The area in which the crash took place is hilly and contains a single track; it is just north of the Chatsworth Metrolink station.\nThe force of the collision sent the locomotive of the Metrolink train to penetrate deep into the lead bi-level passenger car of the three-car train. The collision then knocked the Union Pacific and Metrolink locomotives on their side along with the lead passenger car. \nAccording to various sources, upwards of 10-15 passengers, possibly even more than 20, have been killed, including a Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) officer. The LAPD has not released the name of the officer. The engineer of the Metrolink train is believed to be another of the fatalities.\nThe number of injured is believed to be 135, although the precise number is still unclear. According to emergency responders, the injured have been transported to Los Angeles area hospitals, including the University of California, Northridge Hospital Medical Center, Providence Holy Cross Medical Center and Huntington Hospital.\n\u201cThis is the worst accident I\u2019ve ever seen.

The margin of error was reported as +/-3.1%.\nThe John Birch Society's online poll, however, is showing very different numbers. In it, in which 5,972 took part from late June through last week, Constitution Party nominee Chuck Baldwin leads Barr, McCain and Obama at 1,972 votes (33%). Baldwin is trailed by Barr, who received 1,712 votes (28.7%).

It should be noted that both of the polls were taken before Barr's controversial snubbing of Republican Congressman Ron Paul's third party unity conference on Wednesday. Many of Barr's supporters have since revoked their endorsements of him and joined other presidential campaigns, mainly Baldwin's and Nader's.\nIn the last two weeks, the percentage of third party and undecided voters has ranged from 6 - 8.0%. The percentage of undecided and third party voters reached its peak of 12.0% on July 24th, 2008, but has since steadily declined.

The United States [is] imposing unjust sanctions on Muslims. Imposing such sanctions and boasting of power\n[is] a US hobby.

It also allegedly showed, for the first time, images of some of the members of al-Qaeda responsible for hijacking the aircraft used in the attacks.\nBin Laden also blames the U.S. for the bombings in China in 1997 saying that the U.S. was trying \"to sabotage relations between China and the Muslim world through the CIA.\" He then goes on to say that he would \"promise\" to bring \"action in the understanding between Pakistan, Iran and China.\"\nThe current whereabouts of bin Laden are not known.

The Greens suggested their financial plan, which includes embracing a low-carbon economy, would improve Canada's economic outlook. The NDP promised $1 billion over 5 years for more nurses and doctors.\nThe backdrop to all these economic statements was a 515 point drop on the TSX as markets reacted to the bankruptcy filing of 158 year old financial firm Lehman Brothers, as well as a surprising drop in the Canadian dollar relative to the US dollar which itself lost ground against the Euro and other world currencies. Even as the dollar dropped, so did the price of oil futures and gold, partially explaining the Canadian dollar's weakness."}

On August 23, Edson Smith, a systems engineer for the Program in Computing laboratory at the University of California, Los Angeles in California, United States, confirmed the primality of the number through his work as a volunteer in the project known as the , or GIMPS. This new prime number is expressed as two to the 43,112,609th power minus one, and consists of 12,978,189 decimal digits when written out. This number qualifies GIMPS for a $100,000 award from the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), offered to the first person or group to discover a prime number of 10 million digits or more. According to GIMPS' prize agreement, $50,000 will be given to the UCLA Department of Mathematics, $25,000 will be given to charity, $20,000 will be split among previous discoverers of Mersenne primes, and GIMPS will keep the remainder for funding and other uses. Smith, who was contacted by \"Scientific American\" by phone, said that the discovery was \"quite unexpected.\"\nJust two weeks later, on September 6, another Mersenne prime was discovered, this time by German electrical engineer Hans-Michael Elvenich, who worked for the chemical company in Germany. This number is expressed as two to the 37,156,667th power minus one, and is 11,185,272 digits long. However, since this prime number was discovered later than the one found on August 23, it does not qualify for the EFF prize. Elvenich said that it was a \"finally a great success\" after having participated in GIMPS for four years.\nA prime number is a positive integer that can be evenly divided only by 1 and itself. For example, 2, 3 and 11 are prime numbers. 21 is not a prime number because it is a product of 3 and 7. These types of prime numbers are called , which can be expressed as one less than a . Mersenne primes are rare, and only 46 are known up to now. The first few Mersenne primes are 3, 7, 31, 127 and 8191.\nThese numbers took a total of several weeks to verify, using different software and hardware. Each number was independently checked by several members of GIMPS' verification team, using 16-core systems of different configurations. The two primes were announced by GIMPS on September 16. Before these two discoveries, the two previously largest known prime numbers were discovered by professors and Steven Boone in Missouri, United States, and their record lasted almost three years. Historically, prime numbers discovered by GIMPS are larger than the one previously found. The only other exception was when the 29th Mersenne prime was discovered after the 30th and 31st were found.\nFounded by graduate in 1996, GIMPS has found 12 Mersenne primes, or about one per year on average. Volunteers who wish to help find primes can download a program called , which runs in the background.\nSmaller prime numbers, such as those with a few hundred digits, are often used in cryptography. The recently discovered prime numbers are too large to have much practical value, although it is believed by some that such prime numbers may still have undiscovered uses. However, mathematics enthusiasts often seek them for fun, and the GIMPS community is already looking forward to finding a 100 million digit prime that will qualify for a $150,000 prize from the EFF."}

In exchange, the Federal Reserve will have a 79.9% equity stake, primarily in the form of equity participation notes. The loan carries an interest rate of LIBOR plus 850 points. Should AIG fail, the loan is covered completely by company assets. Should AIG recover however, taxpayers could potentially recover large profits. \nThis news comes on the heels of the Federal Reserve refusing to bail out Lehman Brothers, forcing the company to file for bankruptcy on Monday after Bank of America(BoA) and Barclays PLC pulled out of negotiations over the weekend. The fact that AIG has thousands of divisions engaged in business across the globe sets them apart from the recent problems with other banks. AIG was built up over the last several years via the buyouts and mergers of many companies around the world, offering AIG's stockholders a diverse base of income which allowed it to steadily increase profits. \nIt is this interconnectedness that had the Federal Reserve worried.

Jericho was told last week that he would face CM Punk, the former champion, in a steel cage match for the title during last week's episode of Raw. What he wasn't told was that this would be the first match on the card for this evening, further frustrating the already banged-up champion. The two men would spend nearly twenty minutes attempting to scramble over each other to be the first to scale their way out of the cage, with former champion Punk appearing to dominate for most of the match. \nIn the end, it would be Jericho who would prevail, after an inadvertent head butt by Jericho sent Punk reeling back towards the middle of the ring, while Jericho haphazardly stumbled backwards through the open cage door. After the match, Jericho would seek out WWE Raw General Manager Mike Adamle, taking issue with being booked to wrestle in four high-profile matches in a three-week time span, and demanded that the rookie G.M. needed to learn how to take care of his champions. The two men left to talk in private. \nLater in the evening, John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield lodged a protest in the middle of the ring after his match, demanding that G.M. Adamle declare him to be the #1 Contender for the WWE World Heavyweight Championship. This brought out another former champion, the injured Randy Orton, who told Layfield that he was not impressed with Layfield's performances as of late, and that he was no more worthy to be named the top contender than anybody else who had been making those claims lately. This brought out WWE Intercontinental Champion Santino Marella and girlfriend WWE Women's Champion Beth Phoenix, both of whom have been unhappy with Orton's remarks about them. The four individuals argued, which then brought out yet another former champion, Dave Batista, to continue the arguments. \nG.M. Adamle then appeared on the arena video screens, informing all of the individuals that he would be consulting with current champion Chris Jericho to determine the top contender, which would be announced later in the evening. This would lead to Dave Batista attempting to influence the decisions by attacking Layfield, Marella and Phoenix in the ring, while Randy Orton quickly left. \nThe evening would end on a surprising note for the champion, however. Chris Jericho returned to the ring, informing the fans and G.M. Adamle that his preference would be that John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield and Dave Batista would face each other at the WWE \"No Mercy\" pay-per-view later this month to determine the top contender, and afterwards Jericho would immediately defend the championship against the winner. Adamle came out in front of the live crowd and stated that while he agreed with the idea of the two men fighting for the top contender position at the pay-per-view, he did not like the idea of either of them having to wrestle a second match that night. Instead, the men would face the WWE World Heavyweight Champion at another point in time. \nJericho took exception to this, he wanted to defend the title at the show. Adamle informed Jericho that he would be defending the title against an opponent who asked for a shot at the title earlier in the evening. The fans speculated that this was the returning Shawn Michaels, and they were proven correct when Michaels made his presence in front of the fans.

Pascal Lamy, Director-General of the WTO, speaking at a United Nations conference, said \"In the weeks to come, and depending on progress made by the negotiators, I am ready to call Ministers to Geneva to try and close the issues which remain open so that the scheduling process in both areas can commence.\" \nThe Doha round of talks, named after Doha, the capital city of Qatar, where it was inaugurated in November 2001, focuses heavily on creating a fair system of trade for the benefit of developing countries, in particular for trade in agricultural products.\nThe last major negotiations collapsed in July, after nine days of talks, over issues of agricultural trade between the United States, India, and China. Since then, a series of small negotiations have been held. Lamy called for a ministerial level conference, which would involve ministers from member states. \nThe WTO believes that a completed deal will restore confidence in the global economy and improve the global outlook. Lamy said, \"A failure of the Doha Agenda would have serious implications on the ongoing efforts by all developing countries to address their challenges and in particular to meet the UN Millennium Development Goals. The reasons why we must conclude the Round are visible to all of us and are becoming more critical by the day as the economic and financial outlook continues to deteriorate.\"\nSince the collapse in July, there has been a willingness by member states to hold negotiations again. The United States has been willing to hold negotiations even though the U.S. presidential election will be held in November and a shift in policy on the Doha round might occur as a result of the election. \nHuang Rengang, a senior diplomat at China's WTO mission, told \"Reuters\", \"The problem now is that often in the negotiating rooms you find that some members are obsessed with market access rather than development, are obsessed with inventing new terms like 'key emerging countries'\"."}

Professor Reiss, who was director of education at the Royal Society, said that since a substantial number of pupils have concerns about the issue, they are likely to \"detach from\" science if their concerns and world view are not addressed. Creation should not be taught, he said, but if it comes up, teachers should be encouraged to explain the science of evolution. He also said that students should be taught the nature of a scientific theory - that it does not simply mean a hypothesis about the way things might work, but a rigorously supported system of ideas that fit with the available evidence.\nThe Times of London reported him as saying that Creationism should be taught in science classes as a legitimate point of view. This provoked a storm of protest from a group that included two Nobel Laureates and other scientists who strongly oppose the teaching, or even the discussion of creation in science class.\nYesterday the Royal Society said in a statement that some of Professor Reiss' comments had been \"open to misinterpretation\", and that this had damaged the Society's reputation. \"As a result, Professor Reiss and the Royal Society have agreed that, in the best interests of the society, he will step down immediately as director of education.\" The Royal Society went on to say: \"However, if a young person raises creationism in a science class, teachers should be in a position to explain why evolution is a sound scientific theory and why creationism is not, in any way, scientific.\"\nThe chief executive of the British Association for the Advancement of Science, Roland Jackson, said that the Royal Society should have supported Professor Reiss and used this opportunity to further a reasoned debate. \"I was at the actual discussion, and what I heard him say, however it has been reported, was essentially the position advocated by the Royal Society,\" Jackson said."}

But something that has consistently confused researchers is that the rate of flow for water passing through these special membranes is considerably higher than would be predicted by classical physics. In some experiments the flow rate was up to 10,000 times the speed expected. In addition, recent measurements by a team at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory conducted via nuclear magnetic resonance showed that the water passing through nanotubes exhibits very different properties in comparison to bulk water.\nIn a press release Tuesday the News Bureau of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign highlighted a recent finding that offers one possible explanation for the phenomenon. The research, published in \"Physical Review Letters\" last month (), used molecular modeling to analyze the predicted behavior and interactions of individual water molecules passing through a nanotube.\nUIUC researchers Narayana R. Aluru, a professor of mechanical science and engineering, and doctoral student Sony Joseph found that the chemical polarity of H2O and what they describe as \"confinement effects\" within the bounds of smaller nanotubes cause the molecular movements to couple. Due to the water molecules interacting and orienting themselves in response to one another they flow in a more orderly helical or corkscrew pattern through the nanotube. This flow pattern may explain some of the experimental results obtained by other scientists.\nHopefully this discovery is another step towards an affordable technology to produce plentiful potable water for drinking, irrigation of crops, and other purposes, a vital resource that is in short supply in many parts of the world."}

The MD-82 that was lost at 's in Spanair's first and only fatal accident resulted in the deaths of 154. Controversy has come as a result of both the documents' contents and the fact that it was leaked at all.\nAccording to the report, the airliner was defective for as yet undetermined reasons. The wing flaps failed to move into the required configuration for takeoff, and the alarm system that would normally alert pilots failed to activate, leaving the pilots unaware of the impending crash. The report goes on to note that after a similar accident befell in the United States in 1987, also with 154 dead, manufacturer McDonnel-Douglas (since merged with Boeing) told operators of MD-82s that they recommended pilots verified the alarm system was operational before every takeoff.\nSpanair, however, did not follow this advice and instead trained pilots to check the system before the first takeoff each day and after each change in flight crew. The plane had been taken to Madrid from earlier that day with the same flight crew, and therefore the pilots were not expected to check the alarm.\nSpanair's director of operations, Javier Muela, has responded by denial that the primary cause of the crash was the alarm's failure, as was implied by the report. He did confirm that the airline was not following the recommendation from the airframer, but in his defense said that \"Spanair did not exist\" at the time - \"it was made in 87, Spanair was founded in 88,\" he said. He also said the airline's independent experts did not believe the reports claims about the incorrect flap position was accurate.\nTypically, airliners come with documents detailing operating recommendations among other details, but newspapers have not confirmed that Spanair did in fact receive this information with any of its MD-82s.\nRegardless of the report's accuracy, further controversy has arisen over its status, with a pilots' union enraged over the fact that it was ever made public. The Pilots College, COPAC, expressed an intention to bring legal action against the Ministry for Development. The union say the ministry broke protocols on both confidentiality and law.\nMeanwhile, the investigation continues. It remains unclear why the systems on the aircraft failed, if they indeed did, although Spanish paper \"\" speculates it may be linked to a faulty temperature gauge on one of the engines, which caused the first attempted takeoff to be aborted and delayed the flight an hour. Javier P\u00e9rez, the judge in charge of the investigation, will examine the contents of the aircraft's flight recorders tomorrow. It is also reported that he is unlikely to call any witnesses to the disaster.\nSources.\n "}

The study found 6 confirmed cases of influenza in the vaccinated group compared to 16 cases among the mothers of a control group.\nLate term pregnancy flu vaccination represents an important window for preventive treatment because the flu vaccine is not recommended for infants less than 6 months old.

Glass Bead Collective (GBC), which had interviewed the author of one of the buried videos, was preemptively raided before the RNC according to an interview published on \"Democracynow.org\".\nThe video, which had been buried in the park's ground by the author only known as 'Wes', shows hundreds of people, protesters and others who were there to only to attend the Service Employees International Union (SEIU) concert and were not part of the convention at all; talking amongst themselves or passing through. Nearly 400 armed police officers, dressed in full riot gear, then began to surround them. Some officers were on bicycles while others were on horses. Some people began to yell for help while others complained that the officers cut them off from water and the use of restrooms for at least an hour. One video shows police shooting canisters of tear gas and percussion grenades at seemingly peaceful protesters, some who were on bicycles, were running and screaming for help.\nAccording to another video posted on \"Alternet.org\", among those arrested were people just passing through or were there to use its services. It also states that the National Guard was dispatched to the park. When the narrator of one of the videos asks the police what the police are waiting for, he replies \"we are waiting for them [other officers] to let us know when we can let you leave.\" Several minutes later, police began to arrest everyone they surrounded.\n\"Ladies and gentlemen, you are [all] under arrest. Please be seated, place your hands on your head and cooperate with us,\" stated a police officer speaking through a megaphone. In the background one female is heard saying, \"Are you serious?\" \nThe Glass Bead Collective tells \"Wikinews\" that 'Wes' was charged with \"felony rioting\" but that after spending three days in jail, \"his charges were downgraded to misdemeanors right before he saw the judge\". GBC also tells \"Wikinews\" that about a week after being released, 'Wes' went back to the park and retrieved his videotape.\nIt is not known if anyone was injured nor if any individuals remain in jail. Reports say that 800 people were arrested during the convention, with nearly 20% of those being the people inside the park."}

Jaffe asserts the claim of historic use is truthful and does not necessarily mean that the herb is effective. Other items marketed by the companies named in the action include laetrile, essiac tea, mushroom extracts, and black salve. FDA representative Douglas Stearn expressed concern that people who have cancer may select these items instead of treatments that have been studied and found effective, or that unstudied herbal treatments could produce drug interactions with conventional medicine. \nBefore filing legal action the FTC sent over 100 warning letters and many firms dropped or changed the health claims for their products. In conjunction with the announcement the FDA announced a new website http://www.ftc.gov/curious that urges cancer patients to discuss all treatments they consider trying with their physicians, warns about the dangers of delaying or stopping cancer treatments in favour of alternative medicine, and gives advice about spotting and reporting false health claims."}

They are steelmaker Krakatau Steel, Bank Tabungan Negara (BTN) and national flag carrier Garuda Indonesia.\nThe parliament has left the process fully in the hands of the government, and has set the maximum stake to be sold at 30% for BTN and Krakatau, and 40% for Garuda. Although Indonesia has been known to fund budget deficits with privatisation, the intention is for the funds from this scheme to go to the businesses themselves to allow expansion.\nKrakatau expects 3.2 trillion Rupiah (IDR) from the sale, while the estimated price for their stock is between IDR3 and IDR4 trillion (321 - 428 million USD). Both ArcelorMittal SA, the biggest steelmaker in the world, and BlueScope Steel Ltd, the largest in Australia, have expressed an interest in the IPO. Krakatau will use the funds to help finance an expansion scheme which aims to have production doubled to five million tonnes in 2011.\nBTN, which focuses on home owner loans, has set itself a target income of IDR36.12 trillion (3.86 billion USD) in 2010 compared to a projected IDR22.9 trillion ( 2.45 billion USD) this year. Net profit for this year is projected at IDR472 billion (50.5 million USD)and is hoped to rise to IDR1.39 trillion (148.7 million USD) in 2010. The bank's loan to deposit ratio is predicted to rise from 105.05% this year to 144.93% in 2012. BTN hopes to conduct its IPO before the end of 2008.\nGaruda is not quite 100% state-owned to start with, unlike the other two, but is very close with 95.44% of the company belonging to the government. Like all of Indonesia's 51 airlines, Garuda is on the list of air carriers banned in the EU due to safety concerns raised after a string of air accidents in the nation. Garuda expects to raise IDR4.2 trillion (449.4 million USD) in funds from the IPO, and will use IDR2.5 trillion (267.5 million USD) to pay off its debts and invest IDR1.7 trillion (181.9 million USD) in new aircraft.\nThe government is still working to get a deal to make IPOs for architectural firm Yodya Karya and three plantation firms called Perkebunan Nusantara III, IV and VII.\nSources.\n "}

The study is coordinated by the Human Consciousness Project at the University of Southampton, which specializes in studying the human brain, consciousness and death.\nThe research, expected to take three years, will analyze whether people with no heartbeat or brain activity can have \"out of body\" experiences. Some people report seeing a tunnel or bright light, recall looking down from the ceiling at medical staff, hearing voices telling them to return to the living world and others feel a tremendous sense of peace and well-being. \nDuring the study, doctors will use technology to study the brain and consciousness during cardiac arrest. To test whether such experiences involve the mind leaving the body, pictures will be placed around the areas of the hospital where heart attacks occur most frequently, such as accident and emergency and intensive care units. The pictures will only be visible from above. If patients are able to describe these pictures, project leaders argue that scientists will have to rethink how they understand the mind.\n\"There could be great benefits from this research for the future,\" said Penny Satori, an Intensive care nurse, who leads the project at Morriston Hospital. \"As well as helping surviving patients psychologically after a trauma, it can give peace of mind to grieving families."}

The rumors are considered to be a hoax, connected with the online group known as \"Anonymous\". Other reports say that the website \"4chan.org\" is responsible for starting the rumor which began to spread quickly over the Internet.\nWinfrey is set to appear on tonight's Emmy Awards ceremony broadcast.\nThe rumors started after a statement Winfrey made on a recent show, defending a United States Senate bill against pedophiles and child rapists saying a pedophile group has \"over 9,000 penises\" harming children. She was referring to a comment left on her website by an individual affiliated with \"Anonymous\" who was claiming to be a pedophile. \"Wikinews\" can confirm through anonymous sources that the rumor was started by the group \"Anonymous\" and the website \"4chan\".\nAccording to an edit made by Camalex, a registered user on \"Wikipedia\", Winfrey was found dead \"in her Chicago home early Saturday morning\". It was followed by a source linking to a \"Digg.com\" article, which links to \"oprahsdeath\", a blog website regarding her alleged death. The first edit to her \"Wikipedia\" article, which was posted by an anonymous user, stated that Winfrey was \"lying dead on her bed\" when a family member found her. According to the edit, she had been suffering chest pains for several days, but concealed the discomfort.\nAccording to the \"oprahsdeath\" blog, Winfrey was found dead in her home at 8:21 a.m. on Saturday morning. Winfrey \"appeared to have a bloody area around her eye, a bullet wound in her stomach and some cuts and bruises up and down her body.\" The post also says the suspect was \"beaten\" and \"shot by a handgun\". \nShortly after the \"Wikipedia\" edit, an anonymous user with the IP address, 24.109.236.254 on \"Wikinews\", added an edit to the Newsroom that she had been \"found dead\".\nOn \"Digg\" users posted links to screen shots of websites allegedly carrying the news of her death via an alleged Associated Press report. Other \"Digg\" users left comments claiming to have seen it on their local news stations. Another screen shot apparently shows a BBC News article on her death which states that police released the claims.\nDespite the reports, there were no other news agencies covering Winfrey's alleged death which had lead many to believe the reports to be a hoax. A user commented on the \"Reddit.com\" website that \"there are over 9000 reporters currently converging on Chicago\". According to \"Encyclopedia Dramatica\", the term \"Over 9000!\" has been known to refer to an internet 'meme' which is derived from an Japanese television show called \"Dragon Ball Z\" and was often used to exaggerate the numbers of protesters attending recent anti-Scientology rallies.\nThe \"Post Chronicle\" state that the reports are nothing more than a hoax created by members of the internet website \"4chan.org\". According to the Post's report who quote the \"4chan\", they are vowing to create \"joker-like chaos\" for at least the \"next week\".\n\"Let us take control, create \"Joker-Like\" chaos, this week has been a cute start, but I believe we can do more, much more. We are the new world order. The Illuminati are like children compared to our stature. To put it simply, my point is, Kill the Oprah,\" stated the Chronicle.\nA video posted on \"YouTube\" which shows a broadcast of Winfrey's show, shows her talking about the United States senate bill 1738 which is aimed at establishing \"a Special Counsel for Child Exploitation Prevention and Interdiction within the Office of the Deputy Attorney General, to improve the Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force, to increase resources for regional computer forensic labs, and to make other improvements to increase the ability of law enforcement agencies to investigate and prosecute predators.\" The bill is sponsored by 2008 vice presidential hopeful Joe Biden, Barack Obama's running mate. \nNear the end of Winfrey's statement on the bill, she states that on her message board on her show's website, someone claims to be \"part of a known pedophile network.\"\n\"[He] doesn't forgive. [He] doesn't forget. His group has over 9,000 penises, and they are all raping children,\" stated Winfrey. \"I want you to know they are organized, and they have systematic ways of hurting children\". 'We don't forgive, we don't forget' is a phrase common among the group \"Anonymous\". \"4chan\" has claimed responsibility for the post, and in return allegedly began to spread the rumor of Winfrey's death.\nOne individual who claims to be part of the hoax, tells \"Wikinews\" that it \"was fun as hell [spending] all day \"/b/\" [4chan] photoshopping screenshots of news stories. She got what she deserved. She called anonymous a bunch of pedophiles. Believed a troll on her message boards\".\n\"Wikinews\" has contacted \"The Oprah Winfrey Show\" to get a statement on the incident, but has yet to receive a response.\nThe group \"Anonymous\" has claimed responsibility for several pranks, or hacks against famous people in recent days. Hackers first started by hacking into Sarah Palin's Yahoo e-mail account and the information contained in it was posted to \"Wikileaks.org\". After the incident, FOX News commentator Bill O'Reilly made comments against \"Wikileaks\" and other press agencies who posted the material, which was met with retaliation by hackers who broke into his website, \"BillO'Reilly.com\"."}

Leftist protesters began setting fire to barricades, throwing rocks, stealing weapons, and blocking passage to the \"Stop Islam\" rally. A force of 3,000 police responded with batons and water cannons, and reported that the violence had begun happening in \"large formations\" instead of small groups.\n The anti-Islam rally, organized by the anti-immigration group Pro-Koeln (or \"Pro-Cologne\"), was protesting the construction of a mosque in the city and what the group referred to as an \"immigrant invasion\" of Europe. Plans are underway for the mosque to be completed by 2009 and to be constructed in the city's heavily immigrant district of Ehrenfeld. The mosque is intended to serve Turkish-speaking immigrants and began planning because their current mosque is not large enough for the congregations, and would be the largest mosque in the city.\nGerman police had canceled the protest earlier, fearing violence would break out, and later attempted to halt the fighting between the left and right wing groups. Over 5,000 nonviolent objectors to the rally conducted a sit-down, blocking every entrance to the rally and preventing all but fifty supporters out of 1,500 expected from attending.\nObjections have been heard locally and internationally, with local business owners refusing to sell the city's famous beer to supporters attending the right-wing rally. Iran demanded that Germany halt the rally, and the German Interior Ministry denounced the rally, stating that \"populists and extremists harms the co-existence that the city and Muslim citizens have striven for.\" Cologne's mayor Fritz Schramma condemned it as well, referring to the Pro-Koeln group as \"racists in bourgeois dress\" but stressing that the city felt they had the right to free speech.

Noons was stripped of the title on Friday by EliteXC officials for failure to defend the title. Outlined in a press release, EliteXC Head of Fight Operations, Jeremy Lappen stated that Noons turned down two opportunities to defend the title against top contender Nick Diaz. \n\"It's a very unfortunate situation but we cannot have belt-holders who refuse to fight the top contenders,\" Lappen said in the release. \"We want champions who will fight anyone, anytime, anyplace. That's the mentality all champions should have.\" In June 2008 Noons reportedly turned down an opportunity to defend the title against Diaz in a rematch as the main event on the October 4 EliteXC show on CBS Sports. In August 2008, Noons again turned down an opportunity to fight Diaz for the belt on a future \"ShoXC\" card on Showtime Networks. \"From my view, it is a fight against a top-named opponent in Diaz,\" Lappen went on to say, \"a fighter KJ has bad blood with and a fight the fans really wanted to see. It seemed like a great opportunity for KJ to me.\"\nK.J. Noons won the EliteXC Lightweight Championship on November 10, 2007 after the fight was stopped in the first round due to a cut over the eye of then-champion Nick Diaz. Noons has since successfully defended the title against veteran fighter Yves Edwards after Edwards was pummeled into a TKO 48 seconds into the first round. In an interview with \"Sherdog.com\" on August 29, however, Noons contends that the issue isn't over not wanting the rematch, but compensation by EliteXC. \n\"I always wanted to fight Nick Diaz,\" Noons told reporter Loretta Hunt. \"It's the most marketable fight for me, the best style fight for me. I think the fans want to see it. But you have to pay for something you want to see.\" Noons went on to explain that he took exception with the fact while he made $84,000 in the last two years, Diaz was paid $60,000 to take on lower-ranked opponent Thomas Denny on July 26. \"It is about the money and how they were paying somebody I already beat three times more.\"\nThe future of K.J. Noons in EliteXC is uncertain. \"KJ has two more fights remaining on his contract,\" said Jeremy Lappen, \"We are still looking forward to having him fight for us again soon, but not as our world champion.\" However, recent public finding have revealed that EliteXC is $55 million in debt. Whether or not they can pay out the remainder of Noons' contract remains to be seen. Nonetheless, Noons is determined to continue on. \"I can guarantee you that for MMA, I won't be sitting on the sidelines,\" he said. \"I want to continue with my dream of pursuing two sports.\" \nEliteXC is expected to announce a fight for the vacant Lightweight title in the near future."}

A large amount of helium, which is used to cool the magnets to 1.9 Kelvin (-271C; -456F) leaked into the collider tunnel. LHC will now be shut down for at least two months for repairs. Physicists say such setbacks are an inevitable part of starting up such a large and complicated machine.\nSeveral mishaps, including the failure of a 30 ton electrical transformer, have slowed LHC's progress since the initial start-up on September 10, 2008. The laboratory said in a statement that an electrical connection between the magnets had melted because of the high current. The machine has more than 1,200 dipole magnets arranged end-to-end in the underground ring. These magnets carry and steer the proton beams which will accelerate around the machine at close to the speed of light. One of the LHC's eight sectors will now have to be warmed up to well above its operating temperature so that repairs can take place.\nThe collider is designed to accelerate protons to energies of seven trillion electron volts and collide them together in search of new particles and forces. After the initial success of accelerating protons through the machine, physicists had hoped they could move ahead quickly to low energy collisions at 450 billion electron volts and then 5 trillion electron volt collisions as early as mid-October.\nThe recent setbacks, however, mean that hopes the first trial collisions would be carried out before the machine's official inauguration on October 21, 2008 now look doubtful. It even looks uncertain whether this can be achieved before 2009. \nSources.\n "}

The move has put the issue of American deserters who fled to Canada following the 2003 Invasion of Iraq back in the national spotlight.\nJudge Richard Mosley heard arguments from Hinzman's lawyer that suggested that while desertion was not an unfairly punished crime south of the border, the sentencing of deserter Robin Long several weeks ago proved that the country was targeting those deserters who had also been vocal opponents of the Iraq War with harsher sentences. Prosecutors had pointed to a media interview in which Long criticised the invasion as being illegal and immoral, arguing that it constituted an aggravating factor worthy of additional punishment. \nMosley ruled Hinzman would likely \"suffer irreparable harm\" if Canada were to forcibly return him to the United States.\nOne of the first American soldiers to cross the border in January 2004, Hinzman cited his religious conversion to the Quaker church which forbids violence, but was ordered deported back to the United States along with eight other soldiers who had entered Canada. \nA non-binding vote in Canadian Parliament in June overturned the orders and supported allowing the deserters to remain in the country legally. However, the ruling Conservative Party ignored the vote and ordered the deportations to continue. \nA number of grassroots protests spread across the country, demanding that Hinzman, his wife and two children, and as many as 40 other soldiers and their families now hiding in Canada be allowed to remain.\nDuring the Vietnam War, more than 20,000 American men fled to Canada to avoid serving in combat, with as many as 125,000 family members, supporters and protesters following them. It marked the largest political emigration from the United States since the American Revolution two centuries earlier."}

Methyl salicylate is also known as oil of wintergreen. This semi-volatile plant hormone was detected in the air above the plants in the experiments conducted in a walnut grove near Davis, California. According to the scientists the chemical may be a sort of immune response that help protect the plants. \nAcetylsalicylic acid, commonly called aspirin, had originally come from the bark of Willow trees. It had never been observed to be emitted as a gas. The researchers observed spikes in methyl salicylate after nighttime temperatures dipped low, which suggested the plants were reacting to cold stress. The peaks were higher during a dry period, pointing to combined stress of cold nighttime temperatures and mild drought.\nLaboratory observations have shown that numerous plants produce methyl salicylate, but this is the first time the phenomenon has been observed in nature. Previous studies have shown that plants being eaten by animals produce chemicals that can be sensed by other plants. A study conducted in 1997 found that methyl salicylate is produced by tobacco plants inoculated with tobacco mosaic virus. Emitting methyl salicylate may be a means for the plants to warn other plants about a threat.\nThe finding may help to more readily identify plants under stress by monitoring for the airborne distress signal."}

Chris Jericho will face current antagonist Shawn Michaels in a Ladder Match for the championship at the pay-per-view. Jericho talked about the fact that while fans applauded Michaels' remarks regarding his accomplishments in ladder matches fans have forgotten that Jericho has won three championship titles in ladder matches, and has participated in more high-profile ladder matches than Michaels. This would draw out former champion Randy Orton, who has been injured with a shoulder injury for the last three months. Orton on a tear criticizing current and former champions as well as top contenders as to their worthiness of holding the title, and Chris Jericho was no exception. Just as it looked like Jericho was ready to pummel Orton, Orton declared that WWE \"Raw\" General Manager Mike Adamle made a new proclamation that anybody who attacked Orton would be suspended indefinitely. \nJericho withdrew from the ring, but was immediately replaced by CM Punk, a man Orton attacked a few weeks ago, costing him the WWE World Heavyweight Championship in a four-way match at the WWE Unforgiven pay-per-view. Punk and Orton would come nose-to-nose before Punk slapped Orton in the face, sending him reeling to the corner. General manager Mike Adamle came out along with acting on-air representative Shane McMahon. Together they diffused the situation between Punk and Orton, and announce the main event match, champion Chris Jericho and John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield against Shawn Michaels and Dave Batista. \nBefore that main event happened, Jericho would talk with Mike Adamle in his office, speculating that the reason Shane McMahon was at the show was to test Adamle's skills as a leader rather than a company yes-man, and that rather than following Mr. McMahon's directions to the letter, that he should use them as a suggestion for his own ideas. This would result in the main event becoming a three-on-two match, with the addition of Lance Cade to the team of Jericho and Layfield. Cade, a former prot\u00e9g\u00e9 for Shawn Michaels and current ally of Jericho, played a major factor in the match. Cade's presence in the ring was a distraction to Shawn Michaels, who spent the majority of the match fighting off double-team efforts and cut off from making a tag to his partner. Dave Batista would eventually make that tag, but would be quickly overpowered by Jericho and Layfield. Michaels would tag in one last time while Batista would continue to fight outside of the ring with Layfield. Michaels appeared to have Cade defeated, but a distraction by Jericho allowed Cade to recover and attack Michaels from behind, pinning him after executing a sit-out powerbomb. \nFull match results for the evening:"}

Roger Cressey, once a counter-terrorism official, agreed that the attacks would likely be global and not focused on the US. \nAn advisor to John McCain noted that in the past, Al-Qaeda have used three different tactics to influence elections: public bombings, assassinations, and messages to voters. \nRecently, Al-Qaeda attempted an attack on the new Pakistani President Zardari after his anti-terrorism speech, targeting the Islamabad Mariott hotel where he was expected to eat.

In an excavation conducted at the site, a large number of human remains were found that display signs of physical injury or disease. Study of the teeth from the skeletons indicates that about half of them were from outside the area.\nA large number of bluestone or spotted Preseli dolerite chips found during the excavation led the researchers to conclude the stones were venerated for their healing properties. It is believed that about 80 of such bluestone blocks were transported from the Preseli Hills in Pembrokeshire, Wales to the Salisbury plains. The inner circle of bluestones are the earliest stone structures found in this site. Later bluestones were encircled by the imposing sandstone monoliths of sarsen stones. \"It could be that people were flaking off pieces of bluestone, in order to create little bits to take away... as lucky amulets,\" said Professor Darvill.\nRadiocarbon dating indicates that the original bluestone circle was built around 2300 BC. This date coincides with the burial of \"Amesbury Archer\", whose tomb was discovered near Stonehenge. The skeleton of this man reveals that he had serious knee injury and tooth problems. Researchers therefore conclude that the Archer came to Stonehenge to be healed.\nDating of charcoal fragments revealed that the site was inhabited as early as 7200 BC by groups of hunter-gatherers.

This is because not all the studies required for FDA approval get published. New drug studies that do see publication tend to be ones where the medicine appears to perform well while poor and middling results are less likely to appear in medical journals. The result appears to be that doctors who read the available literature may get an inflated impression of new medications and may prescribe expensive new drugs in place of older medicines that perform as well or better. As Jordan Lite of \"Scientific American\" wonders, \"are drug companies cherry-picking the studies they publish to make their drugs look better than they actually are?\"\nThe University of California team reviewed trials that had supported new drugs approved from 1998 to 2000 and examined 909 trials of 90 medications. The search was conducted upon PubMed and other search tools that a typical medical doctor or patient could access. They concluded that less than half of the studies had been published five years after drug approval and a publication bias existed. \nErick Turner, who coauthored a similar study earlier this year, expressed concerns to \"Scientific American\" that the problem was not merely the raw percentage of studies published, but that a disproportionate share of the research that appeared in journals are examples where new medications appear to perform well:\nKen Johnson, senior vice president of the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA), defended the pharmaceutical industry by saying FDA review of new drug applications is more important than publishing the results of medication trials in medical journals. Approved medications come with labels that give patients and doctors enough information, assures Mr. Johnson.\nYet concerns about full and appropriate disclosure have been serious enough that a new law was enacted last year. FDA Amendments Act of 2007 (FDAAA) requires that all trials which support FDA-approved drugs be registered at the National Institutes of Health website. The requirement goes into effect this coming Saturday. Congress enacted the legislation in response to hearings that determined pharmaceutical companies were less likely to publish studies that indicated significant side effects. One shortcoming in the legislation, according to UCSF associate professor Ida Sim, is that the FDA is still not required to specify which trials it weighs when considering applications for drug approvals. Yet she praises the new law as a major improvement. \"It's critically important that we know trials exist and that we get the summary results, positive and negative, into the public domain\u2014that's a huge step and more than any [other] country is doing now.\""}

He asked the two presidential candidates along with leaders from both parties of Congress to join him for a conference on Thursday.\nLast Friday, Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson called for a bailout plan that would allow for the United States government to purchase devalued mortgage backed securities, resulting from the subprime mortgage crisis, from troubled financial institutions. Paulson has said that the plan could cost up to $700 billion. Congressional leaders have said that some form of the plan will pass; however, there is considerable debate over several key issues.\nWhite House spokeswoman Dana Perino said that Bush \"believes it is important for the American people to fully understand the depth of the crisis in our financial markets, how that crisis affects them, and the urgent need to agree on a solution.\" Bush has been criticized for waiting too long to speak in prime time. \nJohn McCain suspended his campaign to return to Washington and work on the bailout bill. Barack Obama has called for another form of the bill to pass and said that Congress should not package the bailout bill with any other bills \u2014 such as an economic stimulus plan.\nMeanwhile, Congress has held a second round of hearings on the proposed bailout bill. Paulson and Chairman of the Federal Reserve Ben Bernanke testified in front of the House Financial Services Committee. They felt it was a serious problem in need of an immediate solution.\nRep. Barney Frank, Chairman of House Financial Services Committee, says it is \"clear\" that the financial bailout bill will pass.\nDirector of the Congressional Budget Office Peter R. Orsza said while testifying before Congress that \"ironically, the intervention could even trigger additional failures of large institutions, because some institutions may be carrying troubled assets on their books at inflated values.\"\nThe bailout plan has been called a \"blank check\" by many, with members of both parties divided on the issue."}

The game was being played after a week of excitement. The Australian Football League is the major Australian Football competition in Australia.\nThe Grand Final week was full of action, with Adam Cooney winning the Brownlow Medal, and Geelong having to stand David Wojcinski down from their team, to make way for Paul Chapman. \nThe game was preceded with a motorcade of those who have retired from Australian Football during 2008, as well as a presentation showing the heroes of Australian Football in the last 150 years. A performance by rock band Powerfinger followed. Glenn Archer then received the premiership cup from a box traveling down from the roof of the stadium, and gave it to greats of the competing clubs.\nBoth teams started the game unchanged from what was originally named. Alastair Clarkson, coach of Hawthorn said that his team was ready to run out, with strategies to try and curb the 29\u00b0C heat in Melbourne.\nThe coin toss was won by Geelong. The game commenced with a large amount of push and shove in the center square, resulting in a ball up and, eventually, a free kick to Geelong. Tom Lonegan, after 1min35 had been played, kicked the opening goal. Hawthorn then kicked three goals in quick succession. Gary Ablett then kicked a goal, thanks to two 50m penalties. A free kick was then given to Max Rooke, resulting in a goal. Rooke then followed up with another goal. Hawthorn then rushed through two rushed behinds to level the scores. Cameron Mooney then kicked a spectacular goal to put Geelong in front by 7 points. However, Hawthorn made this goal up, and at quarter time Geelong lead by one point.\nGeelong opened the second quarter with a goal to Paul Chapman. Hawthorn responded with a goal to Cyril Rioli. Hawthorn rallied to go ahead and lead at the change. The players were described by 3AW commentators as \"out on their feet\".\nHawthorn tied the scores a 45 points each at about the twenty minute mark before scoring a behind. They led from there on in out scoring Geelong three goals one behind (nineteen) to one goal nine behinds (thirteen) for the quarter.\nGeelong opened the third quarter with a behind. Jarryd Roughead responded with a behind for Hawthorn. Teams went goal for goal, before Geelong scored two points to even the score up. However, Hawthorn then kicked three goals to take the lead. However, just before Three Quarter Time, Geelong kicked two goals. At Three-Quarter-Time, Hawthorn were leading by 23 points.\nBoth sides traded behinds at the start the last quarter. After twelve minutes, Lance Franklin kicked a goal around his body, the first for the quarter. Sam Mitchell kicked another goal one minute later, to take the score sixteen goals seven behinds to nine goals twenty two behinds. Rick Ladson closed out the game with a goal four minutes later. Max Rooke scored a consolation goal for Geelong two minutes later.\n\"NB - Australian Football scores are written Goals.Behinds.Total, where a Goal is worth 6 points, and a Behind is worth 1 point. For example, a score of 1.5.11 would be correct, as (1X6=6)+(5X1=5)=11"}

He felt that it was appropriate for Jawad to receive an early release, and be offered assistance in re-integrating into civilian life. His superiors had over-ruled him, and wanted to seek a life sentence.\nVandeveld has not spoken publicly about his concerns. Jawad's defense counsel, David Frakt, plans to call upon him to testify that the Prosecution had been withholding potentially exculpatory evidence. \nJawad was a minor at the time of the incident;\nJawad had been subjected to sleep deprivation through Guantanamo's frequent flyer program;\nJawad had testified, during his 2004 Combatant Status Review Tribunal that he had accepted a job clearing land mines, only to have his employers drug him, and use him to carry objects he was later informed were bombs. Two other individuals had confessed to throwing the grenade Jawad was being tried for throwing. Their confessions had been withheld from Jawad's Defense counsel.\nAlthough his four-page resignation letter has not been officially released, Carol Rosenberg of the \"Miami Herald\", and other journalists have quoted from it. \nVandeveld wrote:\nCurrent Chief Prosecutor Colonel Lawrence Morris asserted: \u201cAll you have is somebody who is disappointed that his superiors did not agree with his recommendation in a case.\u201d\nFour Prosecutors resigned in 2004 over scandalous promises made by Chief Prosecutor Fred Borch.\nThree of Borch's subordinates wrote letters to Borch's superiors, asking to be reassigned from the Office of Military Commissions because Borch had told them:\nAll the exculpatory evidence would be classified, so the suspect's Defense counsel would never get to see it;\nAll the Commission members who would be serving as the judges were to be picked from officers who could be counted on voting for conviction.\nRobert Preston, John Carr, Carrie Wolf were reassigned. Fred Borch resigned from the military. Thomas Hemingway, Legal Advisor to the Convening Authority, the civilian head of the Office of Military Commissions, asserted that Borch's resignation was unconnected to the memos from his subordinates. Borch was subsequently rehired as a civilian after he resigned from the military.\nIn 2005 Stuart Couch resigned from prosecuting Mohamedou Ould Slahi. Couch stated that even though he suspected Slahi had played a role in activities that otherwise were triable offenses, he should no longer be tried, because he had been subjected to extreme interrogation techniques.\nIn 2007 Guantanamo third Chief Prosecutor, Morris Davis, resigned after publicly challenging the role Legal Advisor Thomas W. Hartmann was trying to play in choosing cases to try. Davis had argued that choosing the cases to prosecute was his role, and that Hartmann had an obligation to remain objective, because he was also supposed to give advise to the head of the Office of Military Commission about the performance of the Defense. Hartmann's role required him to give objective advice after the Commissions made their rulings -- and his objectivity would be in doubt.\nAn inquiry looked into Davis's concern, and directed Davis to follow Hartmann's orders. Davis resigned from the Office of Military Commissions shortly thereafter.\nHartmann was called to testify before three of the Military Commissions, over his role in choosing cases to prosecute, where he testified he thought he was doing his job, and where he stated that he refused to resign. \nHartmann was reassigned a more junior role on September 20, 2008."}

Alamo has previously been convicted on charges of tax evasion. United States federal agents raided Alamo's compound in Arkansas on Saturday and six girls were taken into state custody.\nLaw enforcement officials raided Alamo's compound in Fouke, Arkansas on Saturday and removed six girls aged 10 to 17. Over 100 federal and state agents participated in the raid on the compound, which followed a two-year investigation into Alamo and his organization. \nLaw enforcement officials were searching for evidence that minors had been videotaped performing sexual activities or had been molested. The Federal Bureau of Investigation searched Alamo's property for child pornography. Alamo, who claims he is legally blind and wouldn't be able to see child pornography, preaches that girls should marry young and sex with post-puberty girls is 'okay' because \"in the Bible it happened\".\n\"It's the transportation of minors with the intent to engage in criminal activity. The state concerns are children living at the facility may have been sexually and physically abused,\" said Little Rock, Arkansas FBI representative Tom Browne in a statement to KABC-TV.\nThe Associated Press (AP) has reported that Alamo will likely appear in federal court Friday in Flagstaff, Arizona, on charges that he violated the Mann Act by facilitating transport of minors across state lines for inappropriate sexual conduct. Documents produced by the FBI referred to Alamo by his birth name, Bernie Lazar Hoffman. Alamo has stated that he was born into Judaism but later converted to Christianity. According to the FBI, Alamo's court appearance Friday is intended to determine when he will be transported from Arizona back to Arkansas to face charges there.\nHearings have been scheduled for Friday and Monday by a state judge, to decide if the Department of Human Services of Arkansas can retain custody of the six girls. \"We will transport them to and from hearings. We will take part in any future hearings. Our job right now is to basically take care of them,\" said agency representative Julie Munsell in a statement reported to the AP. The six girls will be present at the hearings in Arkansas: hearings for two of the girls will take place Friday and hearings for the other four on Monday. \nThe Southern Poverty Law Center, an organization which maintains data on hate groups, has described Alamo's organization as a \"cult\". \"The Ross Institute Internet Archives for the Study of Destructive Cults, Controversial Groups and Movements\" maintains a web page on Tony Alamo and his organization. AP reported that many former members of Alamo's organization also characterize the Tony Alamo Christian Ministries as a \"cult\".\nAnna Pugh, a former member of the organization for 11 years, recounted some of her experiences in what she referred to as \"Tony's Cult\" to KOCO-TV. She stated that while she was living at Alamo's compound she felt she was brainwashed. Pugh says that while she was a member of the group a seven-year-old girl took her aside and told her Alamo had sexual conduct with minors while watching pornography. \"I think that congregation in there needs to see what that man is. He is a monster. He is a very unmerciful, malicious, vindictive, judgemental, condemning person,\" said Pugh. \nFormer member Anthony Lane told KSLA-TV he was kicked out of Tony Alamo Christian Ministries when he questioned some of Alamo's teachings. \"He is definitely a man who arranges marriages of little girls, and orders beatings of little children,\" said Lane. He has been getting help from a support group called Partnered against Cult Activities (PACA). Lane is trying to gain custody of his three children who are still in the group with his wife. \nAlamo was convicted of tax evasion in 1994, and was released from prison in 1998 after serving four years out of a six year sentence. The Internal Revenue Service said Alamo owed the U.S. government US$7.9 million. Prosecutors in the tax evasion case argued prior to Alamo's sentencing that he was a flight risk, and a polygamist who conducted inappropriate activities with women and girls in his organization.\nThe Tony Alamo Christian Ministry organization promotes a philosophy and belief system which asserts sex with underage girls and polygamy is acceptable. The organization is critical of Catholicism, homosexuality, and the government. Tony Alamo Christian Ministry has compounds in Arkansas, California, and New Jersey, and Alamo himself lives near Los Angeles."}

Judge Dava Tunis said that Thompson had \"abused the legal system by submitting numerous, frivolous and inappropriate filings\".

These charges were found to be without merit.\nAfter he lost the election to Reno, Thompson engaged in a variety of moral campaigns. Thompson targeted rap music and Howard Stern. Over the last decade Thompson has focused most of his effort against video games and computer games, accusing them of promoting violence and encouraging children to engage in violent behavior. His most recent media attention came when he criticized Grand Theft Auto series of games for sexual and violent content and Bully for violent content. \nThompson responded to the disbarment by issuing a press release claiming it was politically motivated. \"The timing of this disbarment transparently reveals its motivation: This past Friday Thompson filed a federal civil rights action against The Bar, the Supreme Court, and all seven of its Justices. This rush to disbarment is in retribution for the filing of that federal suit.\" Thompson went on to say that \"this should be fun, starting now.\""}

Melamine, although nontoxic in very small amounts, can cause severe kidney problems in large doses.\nGuanshengyuan, a Chinese company that makes children's candy, has stopped selling its popular brand White Rabbit, which is sold nationally in China, after tests confirmed the presence of melamine. Bright foods owns the candy company. Earlier their powdered milk was found to contain melamine which sickened over 53,000 people and was responsible for the deaths of at least four infant children. Guanshengyuan has stopped exporting their goods to the nearly 50 companies overseas that buy them.\nMelamine has also been found in Hong Kong in baby cereal and vegetable formula made by Heinz. It has also been found in wasabi crackers which are manufactured by the Chinese company, Silang House.\nAnother Chinese food company called Marudai Food Co. has also halted the sales of several items such as meat buns, cream buns and corn crepes made with cream over fears that melamine laced powered milk has contaminated their products. So far there have been no reports of any illnesses associated with Marudai Foods.\nFurther items recalled or other products that feared to be contaminated with melamine are Mr. Browns Instant Coffee and tea products, along with their powdered milk.\nThe first report of contamination came last week when the Chinese health ministry confirmed that the companies responsible for producing the milk were trying to repair their damaged public image by increasing output using melamine. The Chinese Health Ministry has stated that most of the tainted milk was produced by Shijiazhuang Sanlu Group Co.\nThe WHO says that women with infants should consider breast feeding for the time being on infants aged at least six months, until the contaminated milk can be removed from the consumption chain.\n\"WHO recommends that all infants should be fed exclusively with breast milk for the first six months of life. No other liquid or food, not even water, is needed during this period. Thereafter, infants should receive adequate and safe complementary foods while breastfeeding continues up to two years of age and beyond,\" said the WHO in a statement on their website. \nIn 2007, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) confirmed the presence of melamine in pet food that was imported from China. Samples indicated that wheat gluten, used as an ingredient in the pet food, was contaminated with the chemical. As a result of the contamination, the FDA said some of the contaminated gluten entered the human food chain. At least 45 people ate contaminated pork which was traced to pigs from a farm in California. The pigs had eaten feed that had been contaminated. There were no reports of deaths or illnesses."}

The weapons seized ranged from grenade launchers to 33 Soviet tanks, the Ukrainian defense ministry told the press. 17 multi-national crewmen were also captured.\nThe \"Faina\" was making a delivery to the Kenyan government, which is a Western ally against terrorism.\nThe ship had taken a detour to avoid the pirate-controlled Somalian coast, which is notorious for holding ships and cargo ransom. Experts expect the pirates to ransom off the tanks, because they don't have the ability to remove or use them. \nThe Russian navy deployed a warship on Friday to assist Somalia in securing the coastline and re-secure the ship. According to Vladimir Vysotsky, the head of the Russian Navy, \"Russian ships will not be involved in any international operations,\" as \"they will do this job on their own.\" \nUS military spokesman Bryan Whitman reported that the US is monitoring the events closely, because of the type of cargo captured.\nCanada, meanwhile, has been assisting the UN by escorting aid ships to the war-torn area since August.

Despite that McCain had asked to postpone the debate, both were present at the University of Mississippi. The debate, which was moderated by PBS' Jim Lehrer, was planned to be focused on foreign policy, however due to concerns about the US financial crisis, the debate began focused on economy.\nMcCain repeatedly referred to his experience, drawing on stories from the past. Often, he joked of his age and at one point seemed to mock his opponent. Obama spoke of mistakes and repeatedly laid out detailed plans.\nThe debate was widely seen as a draw. A CBS poll conducted after the debate on independent voters found that 38% felt it was a draw, 40% felt Obama had won, and 22% thought that McCain had won. Voters and analysts agreed that Obama had won on the economy, but that McCain had done better on foreign policy issues, which were the focus of the debate. However, Obama had a more substantial lead on the economy than McCain did on foreign policy.\nThe McCain campaign faced some ridicule prior to the debate, after airing an internet ad declaring McCain had won the debate hours before it had started.\nFinancial &amp; bailout plans.\nThe candidates were asked where they stood on the country's financial plans.\nObama put forward four proposals for helping the economy. First, to \"make sure that we've got oversight over this whole [bailout] process\". Second, to \"make sure that taxpayers, when they are putting their money at risk, have the possibility of getting that money back and gains\". Third, to \"make sure that none of that money is going to pad CEO bank accounts or to promote golden parachutes\". And lastly, \"make sure that we're helping homeowners, because the root problem here has to do with the foreclosures that are taking place all across the country\".\nHe then went on to say, \"we also have to recognize that this is a final verdict on eight years of failed economic policies promoted by George Bush, supported by Senator McCain, a theory that basically says that we can shred regulations and consumer protections and give more and more to the most, and somehow prosperity will trickle down\".\nLehrer then turned to McCain, giving him two minutes as well. \nMcCain, on the other hand, stressed the urgency of the crisis and the partisanship present in Washington before going on. \"This package has transparency in it. It has to have accountability and oversight. It has to have options for loans to failing businesses, rather than the government taking over those loans. We have to -- it has to have a package with a number of other essential elements to it,\" he told viewers, pausing to briefly mention energy and jobs before Lehrer stopped him.\nLehrer asked the two to come back to his question and urging them to speak to each other, first turning to Senator Obama.\n\"We haven't seen the language yet,\" Obama began, speaking to Lehrer and not McCain. \"And I do think that there's constructive work being done out there\", he said, before noting he was optimistic a plan would come together. \"The question, I think, that we have to ask ourselves is, how did we get into this situation in the first place?\"\nHe continued, stressing his foresight on the issues two years ago, before Lehrer turned to McCain, asking if he planned to vote for the bailout plan.\nMcCain stammered that he hoped so. Lehrer asked again, and McCain replied, \"Sure. But -- but let me -- let me point out, I also warned about Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and warned about corporate greed and excess, and CEO pay, and all that. A lot of us saw this train wreck coming.\"\nMcCain then continued, giving a story about former US President Dwight Eisenhower, who \"on the night before the Normandy invasion, went into his room, and he wrote out two letter\". Eisenhower, he said, had taken accountability for his actions.\n\"As president of the United States, people are going to be held accountable in my administration. And I promise you that that will happen.\"\nObama then agreed with McCain, adding that more accountability was needed but not just when there's a panic. \"There are folks out there who've been struggling before this crisis took place,\" Obama continued, \"and that's why it's so important, as we solve this short-term problem, that we look at some of the underlying issues that have led to wages and incomes for ordinary Americans to go down, the -- a health care system that is broken, energy policies that are not working, because, you know, 10 days ago, John said that the fundamentals of the economy are sound\".\nObama was asked to say it to McCain. Obama replied, \"I do not think that they are\". Lehrer asked him to say it more directly to McCain, and Obama laughed, repeating himself to McCain.\nMcCain joked about his age, saying, \"Are you afraid I couldn't hear him?\"\nObama said that he and McCain disagreed fundamentally and that he wanted accountability \"not just when there's a crisis for folks who have power and influence and can hire lobbyists, but for the nurse, the teacher, the police officer, who, frankly, at the end of each month, they've got a little financial crisis going on. They're having to take out extra debt just to make their mortgage payments\". Tax policies, he said, were a good example.\nMcCain disagreed. \"No, I -- look, we've got to fix the system. We've got fundamental problems in the system. And Main Street is paying a penalty for the excesses and greed in Washington, D.C., and on Wall Street. So there's no doubt that we have a long way to go. And, obviously, stricter interpretation and consolidation of the various regulatory agencies that weren't doing their job, that has brought on this crisis\".\nFundamental differences.\nLehrer went on to the next question, asking if there were fundamental differences between the approaches of the two.\nMcCain began by saying he wanted to lower \"completely out of control\" spending. He promised as president to \"veto every single spending bill\" He then attacked Senator Obama's use of earmarks, citing it as a fundamental difference.\nSenator Obama agreed that earmarks were being abused, but not that it was a large problem. \"Earmarks account for $18 billion in last year's budget. Senator McCain is proposing -- and this is a fundamental difference between us -- $300 billion in tax cuts to some of the wealthiest corporations and individuals in the country, $300 billion. Now, $18 billion is important; $300 billion is really important.\" He then attacked McCain's tax plans, saying, \"you would have CEOs of Fortune 500 companies getting an average of $700,000 in reduced taxes, while leaving 100 million Americans out\". \nHe then stressed his focus on the middle class, saying, \"We've got to grow the economy from the bottom up. What I've called for is a tax cut for 95 percent of working families, 95 percent\". \nMcCain was called on.\n\"Now, Senator Obama didn't mention that, along with his tax cuts, he is also proposing some $800 billion in new spending on new programs,\" McCain said, attacking his opponent. He also said that Obama had only suspended pork barrel spending after he started running for president.\n\"What I do is I close corporate loopholes,\" Obama objected, \"stop providing tax cuts to corporations that are shipping jobs overseas so that we're giving tax breaks to companies that are investing here in the United States. I make sure that we have a health care system that allows for everyone to have basic coverage\".\nHe then turned to McCain, asking him to look at his tax policies, which he said were ignoring the middle class and a continuation of Bush policies. \nLehrer asked McCain to respond directly to Obama's attack on his tax policies.\n\"Well -- well, let me give you an example of what Senator Obama finds objectionable, the business tax,\" McCain began. He then explained the reasoning behind his business tax cuts, saying that companies would want to start in countries where they would pay less taxes. \"I want to cut that business tax. I want to cut it so that businesses will remain in -- in the United States of America and create jobs\". \nObama explained that his tax cuts would affect 95% of taxpayers, then replied, \"Now, John mentioned the fact that business taxes on paper are high in this country, and he's absolutely right. Here's the problem: There are so many loopholes that have been written into the tax code, oftentimes with support of Senator McCain, that we actually see our businesses pay effectively one of the lowest tax rates in the world\".\nMcCain, he said, opposed closing loopholes but just wanted to add more tax breaks on top of that.\nHe went on, attacking McCain's health credit idea, saying that McCain wanted to tax health credits. \"Your employer now has to pay taxes on the health care that you're getting from your employer. And if you end up losing your health care from your employer, you've got to go out on the open market and try to buy it\".\nMcCain responded with an example of Obama voting for tax breaks of oil companies.\nObama cut in, \"John, you want to give oil companies another $4 billion\", he pointed out.\nMcCain shot back, attacking Obama's earmark spending and tax policies. \"Who's the person who has believed that the best thing for America is -- is to have a tax system that is fundamentally fair?\", he said, referring to himself. \"And I've fought to simplify it, and I have proposals to simplify it\".\nHe then accused Obama of voting \"to increase taxes on people who make as low as $42,000 a year\". Obama repeated several times that McCain's accusations were untrue.\nMcCain then accused him of giving tax cuts to oil companies, which Obama once again said was untrue. \"The fact of the matter is, is that I was opposed to those tax breaks, tried to strip them out,\"he said. \"We've got an emergency bill on the Senate floor right now that contains some good stuff, some stuff you want, including drilling off-shore, but you're opposed to it because it would strip away those tax breaks that have gone to oil companies.\"\nPost-financial crisis plans.\nLehrer then broke in, stopping the argument. He switched to a new question, asking what priorities and goals for the country the candidates would give up as a result of the financial crisis.\nHe allowed Obama to answer the question first, who said many things would have to be delayed but not forgotten. He then began to list what he felt the country had to have to continue to compete.\n\"We have to have energy independence,\" he said, \"so I've put forward a plan to make sure that, in 10 years' time, we have freed ourselves from dependence on Middle Eastern oil by increasing production at home, but most importantly by starting to invest in alternative energy, solar, wind, biodiesel\".\nHe continued, saying that the health care system had to be fixed because it was bankrupting families.\n\"We've got to make sure that we're competing in education,\" he continued. \"We've got to make sure that our children are keeping pace in math and in science.\" He also mentioned making sure college was still affordable. \nHe also stressed making sure the country was still stable structurally, \"to make sure that we can compete in this global economy\".\nLehrer then turned to McCain, asking him to present his ideas.\n\"Look, we, no matter what, we've got to cut spending\", McCain began and reminded the audience that he \"saved the taxpayers $6.8 billion by fighting a contract that was negotiated between Boeing and DOD that was completely wrong\".\nLehrer broke in, asking if it was correct that neither of them had any major changes to implement after the financial crisis. \nObama replied that many things would have to be delayed and put aside, and that investments had to be made. He then agreed with McCain that cuts had to be made. \"We right now give $15 billion every year as subsidies to private insurers under the Medicare system. Doesn't work any better through the private insurers. They just skim off $15 billion. That was a give away and part of the reason is because lobbyists are able to shape how Medicare work\".\nMcCain then made a suggestion. \"How about a spending freeze on everything but defense, veteran affairs and entitlement programs\". Lehrer repeated \"spending freeze?\" and McCain went on, \"I think we ought to seriously consider with the exceptions the caring of veterans, national defense and several other vital issues\".\nObama disagreed with McCain's idea, saying it was \"using a hatchet\". Some vital programs, he said, were seriously underfunded. \"I went to increase early childhood education and the notion that we should freeze that when there may be, for example, this Medicare subsidy doesn't make sense\".\nThe two candidates began to argue more directly. \n\"We have to have,\" McCain argued, \"wind, tide, solar, natural gas, flex fuel cars and all that but we also have to have offshore drilling and we also have to have nuclear power\".\nHe accused Obama of opposing storing nuclear fuel.\nLehrer interrupted the two with another question, asking how the financial crisis would affect how they ran the country.\nObama replied first. \"There's no doubt it will affect our budgets. There is no doubt about it\". He went on to stress that it was a critical time and the country's long term priorities had to be sorted out.\nMcCain replied by criticizing Obama's health care plans. \"I want the families to make decisions between themselves and their doctors. Not the federal government,\" he said, then called for lower spending.\nHe went on to speak about the national debt and stressing the importance of low taxes.\nObama went on the offensive, attacking McCain's record of voting. \"John, it's been your president who you said you agreed with 90 percent of the time who presided over this increase in spending\", he said, accusing him of voting for an \"orgy of spending\".\nMcCain countered that he had opposed Bush \"on spending, on climate change, on torture of prisoner, on - on Guantanamo Bay. On a -- on the way that the Iraq War was conducted\". He called himself a maverick, and referred to his running mate as a maverick as well.\nLessons of Iraq.\nLehrer asked the two what the lessons of Iraq were.\nMcCain answered first, stressing that the war in Iraq was going well. \"I think the lessons of Iraq are very clear,\" he answered, \"that you cannot have a failed strategy that will then cause you to nearly lose a conflict\".\nHe went on to praise the efforts in Iraq, saying the strategy was successful and the US was winning. \"And we will come home with victory and with honor. And that withdrawal is the result of every counterinsurgency that succeeds\", and continued that Iraq would make a stable ally.\nLehrer asked Obama how he saw the lessons of Iraq, who began by questioning the fundamentals of the war and whether the US should have gone in the first place.\n\"We took our eye off [bin Laden]. And not to mention that we are still spending $10 billion a month, when they have a $79 billion surplus, at a time when we are in great distress here at home, and we just talked about the fact that our budget is way overstretched and we are borrowing money from overseas to try to finance just some of the basic functions of our government\".\nThe lesson, he said, was to \"never hesitate to use military force\", but to use it wisely.\nMcCain was asked if he agreed on the lesson, though he did not comment on a lesson learned. Obama, he said, had been wrong about the surge.\nThe two opponents then began arguing, as Lehrman tried to mediate them.\nMcCain felt it was remarkable that \"Senator Obama is the chairperson of a committee that oversights NATO that's in Afghanistan. To this day, he has never had a hearing\". \n\"The issues of Afghanistan,\" Obama responded, \"the issues of Iraq, critical issues like that, don't go through my subcommittee because they're done as a committee as a whole\".\nHe then began to attack McCain's optimism. \"You said that we were going to be greeted as liberators. You were wrong. You said that there was no history of violence between Shiite and Sunni. And you were wrong\".\nMcCain responded to the criticism by telling a story of when he spoke to troops who were re-enlisting. \"And you know what they said to us? They said, let us win. They said, let us win. We don't want our kids coming back here. And this strategy, and this general, they are winning. Senator Obama refuses to acknowledge that we are winning in Iraq\".\nMcCain repeatedly accused Obama of opposing funding to troops.\nObama responded by speaking to Lehrer, to explain why he had voted against funding troops. \"Senator McCain opposed funding for troops in legislation that had a timetable, because he didn't believe in a timetable. I opposed funding a mission that had no timetable, and was open- ended, giving a blank check to George Bush. We had a difference on the timetable\".\n\"Admiral Mullen suggests that Senator Obama's plan is dangerous for America,\" McCain cut in once Obama had finished.\nObama said it was not the case, that the wording was \"a precipitous withdrawal would be dangerous\".\nMcCain then argued that Iraq, and not Afghanistan, was the central battle ground against terrorism. He also attacked Obama's surprise that the surge had worked.\nTroops in Afghanistan.\nLehrer switched to a new question. \"Do you think more troops -- more U.S. troops should be sent to Afghanistan, how many, and when?\"\nObama mentioned he had been saying more troops in Afghanistan were needed for over a year. He argued that no Al-Qaeda were present in Iraq before the invasion, and the people there had nothing to do with 9/11.\nHe then went on to list a three part plan beginning with pressuring the Afghani government to work for it's people and control it's poppy trade. He also pressed the need to stop giving money to Pakistan.\nMcCain responded by saying Iraq had to be stabilized and that he would not make the mistake of leaving Iraq the way it is.\n\"If you're going to aim a gun at somebody,\" he said, \"you'd better be prepared to pull the trigger\".\nObama responded by arguing that if the Pakistani government would not take care of terrorists in it's borders, action had to be taken. He then commented on past US policies with Pakistan, saying that the US support of Musharraf had alienated the Pakistani people. \n\"And as a consequence, we lost legitimacy in Pakistan. We spent $10 billion. And in the meantime, they weren't going after al Qaeda, and they are more powerful now than at any time since we began the war in Afghanistan. That's going to change when I'm president of the United States\", he finished. \nMcCain quickly replied that Pakistan was a failed state at the time. He then went on to talk about his voting record. \"I have a record of being involved in these national security issues, which involve the highest responsibility and the toughest decisions that any president can make, and that is to send our young men and women into harm's way\".\nObama argued that Afghanistan could not be muddled through, and that problems were being caused by not focusing on Al-Qaeda. As he finished, Lehrer attempted to announce a new question, but McCain quickly attacked Obama, saying his plans would have a \"calamitous effect\" on national security and the region.\nIran.\nLehrer directed his next question towards McCain, asking about his thoughts on Iran and it's threat to the US. \nMcCain's reading of the threat in Iran was \"if Iran acquires nuclear weapons, it is an existential threat to the State of Israel and to other countries in the region\". He stressed the need to avoid another Holocaust, and the need for a league of democracies to battle Iran. \"I am convinced that together, we can, with the French, with the British, with the Germans and other countries, democracies around the world, we can affect Iranian behavior\". \nObama went next, focusing on the Iraq war's effect on Iran. Iraq, he said, was Iran's \"mortal enemy\" and had kept Iran from becoming a threat. \"That was cleared away. And what we've seen over the last several years is Iran's influence grow. They have funded Hezbollah, they have funded Hamas, they have gone from zero centrifuges to 4,000 centrifuges to develop a nuclear weapon\".\nHe then went on to say that refusing to use diplomacy with hostile nations has only made matters worse and isolated the US.\nDiplomacy.\nLehrer turned to McCain, asking him how he felt about diplomacy as a solution.\nMcCain hurried through his response, attacking Obama on his willingness to meet with hostile leaders without preconditions. People like Ahmadinejad, he said, would have their ideas legitimized if a President met with them.\nObama responded by pointing out that Ahmadinejad was only a minor leader. Meeting leaders without preconditions, he said, \"doesn't mean that you invite them over for tea one day\". He then turned to attacking McCain, who he said \"would not meet potentially with the prime minister of Spain, because he -- you know, he wasn't sure whether they were aligned with us. I mean, Spain? Spain is a NATO ally\".\nMcCain retorted that he was not yet President so it would be out of place. The two then began to argue over the comments of Dr. Kissinger's stance on meeting foreign leaders.\nMcCain argued that meeting with and legitimizing ideas was dangerous and naive, and said it was a fundamental difference of opinion.\nObama accused McCain of misrepresentation, stressing that he would not speak without low level talks and preparations.\nMcCain responded by mocking Obama. \"So let me get this right. We sit down with Ahmadinejad, and he says, 'We're going to wipe Israel off the face of the Earth,' and we say, 'No, you're not'? Oh, please\".\nRelationship with Russia.\nThe two started arguing among each other, as Lehrer attempted to interject, finally succeeding with a new question. He turned to Obama, asking how he saw the relationship with Russia and it's potential.\nObama began spelling out his opinion, stating that he felt the US approach to Russia had to be evaluated. He then continued that the US has to press for a unified alliance and for Russia to remove itself from other nations, adding that the US had to \"explain to the Russians that you cannot be a 21st-century superpower, or power, and act like a 20th-century dictatorship\". \nHe went on, stressing the importance of diplomacy and affirming relationships, and inviting Russian-influenced countries into NATO. \"Now, we also can't return to a Cold War posture with respect to Russia. It's important that we recognize there are going to be some areas of common interest. One is nuclear proliferation\".\nMcCain responded by attacking Obama's reaction to the Russian-Georgian conflict, criticizing his initial comment that both sides should show restraint, calling it naive. \"He doesn't understand that Russia committed serious aggression against Georgia. And Russia has now become a nation fueled by petro-dollars that is basically a KGB apparatchik-run government\".\nLehrer asked Obama if there were any major differences between the two's opinion on Russia, who answered that he and McCain had similar opinions on Russia. He then stressed foresight in dealing with Russia, as well as reducing dependence on foreign oil through alternative energy.\nAlternative energy.\n\"Over 26 years, Senator McCain voted 23 times against alternative energy, like solar, and wind, and biodiesel,\" he mentioned.\nThe two began to argue over alternative energy. As Lehrer began announcing the next question, McCain interjected. \"No one from Arizona is against solar. And Senator Obama says he's for nuclear, but he's against reprocessing and he's against storing So,\" he continued, as Obama objected, \"it's hard to get there from here. And off-shore drilling is also something that is very important and it is a bridge\". \nMcCain continued, as Obama interrupted to correct him, saying that he had voted for storing nuclear waste safely. \nThe two began interrupting each other, each trying to get a word in, before Lehrer stopped them and moved on.\nLikelihood of another 9/11.\n\"What do you think the likelihood is that there would be another 9/11-type attack on the continental United States?\" asked Lehrer.\nMcCain said that America was far safer since 9/11, which he claimed a hand in. He went on to stress better intelligence and technology in keeping America safe, but that he felt the US was far safer.\nLehrer then turned to Obama.\nObama disagreed slightly, saying America was safer in some ways, but \"we still have a long way to go\". He also felt that the US was not focusing enough on Al-Qaeda and fighting in Iraq was not making the US safer.\nMcCain accused Senator Obama of not understanding that \"if we fail in Iraq, it encourages al Qaeda. They would establish a base in Iraq\".\nLehrer asked if Obama agreed.\nObama argued that the sole focus was currently Iraq, but that \"in the meantime, bin Laden is still out there. He is not captured. He is not killed\". He noted that $10 billion was spent in Iraq every month, instead of going to healthcare. He argued that veterans were not getting the benefits they deserved, and that the next president's strategies had to be broader. \nMcCain responded by attacking Obama saying he didn't think Obama had the knowledge or experience to be President.\nObama then said that the job of the next President would be to repair America's image and economy.\nMcCain concluded by citing his POW experience. \"Jim, when I came home from prison, I saw our veterans being very badly treated, and it made me sad. And I embarked on an effort to resolve the POW-MIA issue, which we did in a bipartisan fashion, and then I worked on normalization of relations between our two countries so that our veterans could come all the way home\".\n\"And that ends this debate tonight,\" finished Jim Lehrer."}

The Acasta gneiss in Canada's Northwest Territories is dated at 4030 million years. Previous studies on the mineral ages of zircon found in younger rocks from Western Australia have indicated 4360 million years.

Schaper, in an interview with Wikinews reporter Jason Safoutin, denied involvement in a previous run of DMCA requests involving similar video material. However, the videos in question bear a message that Schaper was the originator of the request.\nAccording to \"YouTube\" the 11 videos were removed by direct DMCA requests from Schaper. The videos have been reported to be of anti-Scientology protests, recorded by various members of the group \"Anonymous\".\nIn early September, an entity named American Rights Counsel LLC -- which has described itself as a 'rights group', but without provision of contact details -- requested the removal from \"YouTube\" of over 4,000 anti-Scientology videos. Many of these videos consisted entirely of self-made content by anti-Scientology protesters; others were quite explicitly extracts from official Church of Scientology footage. Users had initially speculated that Schaper was responsible for these requests; no evidence, however, has been obtained to this effect, nor has official comment been obtained from American Rights Counsel.\nWhen comment was requested further to these earlier removal requests, Schaper stated that he was a \"... very strong advocate for the Church of Scientology, the religion of Scientology and a free speech advocate.\" Schaper alleged that he had \"...to this date no information about the American Rights Counsel\" and \"no connection, knowledge or involvement in this company [American Rights Counsel]\". \n\"Wikinews\" contacted Schaper to find out why he made the new requests. According to him, the videos were not of protests against Scientology, but instead were videos of alleged hate-crimes and hate-speech, which were allegedly attacking Schaper personally. \n\"None of the videos are accounts of any protests. The videos in question have been produced by an YouTube (U.K.) user to directly attack me and my companies. I made the requests in accordance with YouTube\u2019s terms and condition, after confirming directly with YouTube and the local ECTF office in Los Angeles, to remove material that infringes on my copyright. None of the videos removed by YouTube fall under the fair use guidelines or can be considered news-worthy. The content of the videos has been classified by law-enforcement as hate-speech and frivolous attack. The producers of these videos are based in the U.K. and local law-enforcement has been contacted by the FBI,\" said Schaper to \"Wikinews\".\nWhen \"Wikinews\" asked Schaper if he was acting on behalf of the Church, Schaper denied any such involvement. He also stated that he was not attempting to remove videos critical of him, or the Church, but also emphasizes other videos still on \"YouTube\" that are \"a personal attack against me and my beliefs.\"\n\"Despite the fact that I am a Scientologist, none of the videos removed, where removed on behalf of the Church of Scientology or any organization associated with the church. In addition I like to point out that I have not removed any video, critical of me personally which does not violate my copyrights and I have no intention to do so,\" said Schaper.\nIn addition, Wikinews invited Dr. Schaper to comment on the apparent discrepancy between his actions and his advocacy of free speech. Dr. Schaper feels that that the two stated aims are not in conflict, stating, \"I believe the First Amendment but I also see how Anonymous tries to abuse these liberties. Not everything is protected under the free speech clause and laws have been enacted to protect each citizen from abuse.\"\nSchaper also stated that \"Anonymous\" is \"breaking the law\" by uploading material to \"YouTube\" which could be considered hate crimes. He also states that he would not mind a one-on-one conversation with some members of \"Anonymous\", but \"these guys don\u2019t have the balls for a direct sit-down because they should get their facts straight.\"\n\"Anonymous is overstating a case and claims that their abuse and online bullying would be protected under the First Amendment forgetting the fact that they indeed are breaking the laws,\" added Schaper.\nSchaper does not plan on enforcing the Church's copyrights saying, \"they can handle their own content\" and that he \"will continue to enforce my copyrights and seek full prosecution in cooperation with federal law-enforcement.\"\n\"Wikinews\" has contacted \"YouTube\" for a statement regarding this incident, but has yet to receive a response.

The rich diversity of the riding has less than half of all households reporting English as the first language at home.\nEmerson cited this diversity after announcing he would not be running for a third term. \"The reality is, Kingsway was an eminently winnable seat,\" said the Conservative Minister. \"Not because I'm a hugely popular fellow in Kingsway, but because of vote splits and the way the first-past-the-post system works.\"\nKey in those vote splits are issues dividing the Liberal and NDP candidates. Naturalized Canadian Yuan points to her immigrant history, giving her an empathy with the immigrant and ethnic neighborhoods of the riding. \u201cI came with limited means but through hard work, I got recognized and became a successful businesswoman. I understand what immigrants have to go through to reach what they want.\u201d\n\u201cI really respect and appreciate and like the multicultural fabric of our riding,\u201d says her NDP opponent Davies. \u201cThat\u2019s why I live in Kingsway.

He's lived for the past three years in the riding, an engineer and small business owner who has a history of community involvement across south Vancouver. \"I see the neighbourhoods in and around Kingsway as a great place to build on the natural vibrancy of the small business sector as a backbone for ethnically and economically diverse communities.\"\nMatt Kadioglu of the Libertarians is a relative newcomer with one previous campaign, while Donna Petersen (Marxist-Leninist) and Kimball Cariou (Communist) each have four previous contests according to Pundits Guide.\nThe stage for this fight was set in 2006, when newly-elected Liberal Dave Emerson crossed the floor and directly into the Conservative Cabinet, first as Minister of International Trade then as Minister of Foreign Affairs following the resignation of Maxime Bernier. His defection stirred a firestorm of controversy locally in the staunchly left-leaning riding, which had elected a Progressive Conservative candidate exactly once since it's creation in 1953 - during the 1958 Diefenbaker landslide.\nIn 2004 then-Prime Minister Paul Martin parachuted Emerson in, displacing the brewing contest between incumbent Liberal Sophia Leung and Ms Yuan. Emerson won the riding against Ian Waddell, the NDP candidate who had represented the riding from 1979-1988, and again by a wider margin in 2006 when other Liberals fell as victims of the Sponsorship Scandal."}

Previous attempts to launch this vehicle ended in failure due to engineering errors. Perhaps the most critical part of this flight occurred during the stage separation between the first and second stages of this rocket. In this flight, unlike previous attempts, the separation was without incident and the second stage maintained the planned trajectory into orbit. The rocket achieved an orbit at an altitude of 135 miles above the Earth after approximately ten minutes of powered flight.\nThe main technical difference between the third and fourth attempts was an adjustment in the timing between shutting down the first stage rocket engine and when the stage separation takes place. On the third attempt, the first and second stages collided into each other immediately after stage separation, which in turn damaged the second stage engine and resulted in a mission failure. For this fourth attempt, the stage separation occurred without any problem, and was greeted with loud cheers and applause by SpaceX employees who were watching a live telecast of the launch at the Hawthorne, California, USA manufacturing plant. This telecast was also released as a live video feed on the SpaceX website during the launch.\nWhile other rocket companies have been successful at sending vehicles into orbit before, this is the first vehicle that has been designed from scratch without any components that came from previous government-sponsored vehicles. This is also the first privately developed liquid-fueled vehicle that has achieved orbit.\nElon Musk, founder, primary investor, and CEO of SpaceX, congratulated his employees upon reaching this milestone, saying \"That was frickin' awesome! There's only a handful of countries on Earth that have done this. It's usually a country thing, not a company thing. We did it.\" He also said later on, \"Definitely one of the best days of my life.\"\nThe payload of this rocket consisted of a 360 pound engineering test object made of aluminum, which was also fabricated by SpaceX in their Hawthorne manufacturing facility. Called the Ratsat, it was decorated with a logo of a rat by the SpaceX team that built it. Elon Musk estimates that it will remain in orbit for between five and ten years before burning up in the atmosphere.\nAdditional milestones accomplished by SpaceX on this flight included a successful deployment of parachutes on the first stage of this rocket, where SpaceX hopes to be able to recover this stage and be able to re-use that portion of the rocket on a future flight with some refurbishing. The second stage also performed an additional test by restarting its engine and moving to a higher orbit at between 300 to 450 miles (500 to 700 km) above the Earth with an inclination of 9.2 degrees, passing above the International Space Station during the maneuver.\n\"This is a great day for SpaceX and the culmination of an enormous amount of work by a great team,\" said Elon Musk, \"The data shows we achieved a super precise orbit insertion\u2014middle of the bull's-eye \u2014 and then went on to coast and restart the second stage, which was icing on the cake.\"\nSpaceX is offering future flights of the Falcon 1 to the public for a price of about $7.9 million USD each, although Mr. Musk estimated that the total cost to test and develop this rocket, including the three previous failed launch attempts, came to about $100 million USD.\nThe next launch of the Falcon 1 is slated to happen sometime toward the end of the year, with a satellite that was manufactured and paid by the Malaysian government. Also scheduled for early next year is the maiden flight of the Falcon 9 rocket, which uses a multiples of nine rocket engines that are identical to the engine that was used in today's launch as well as many of the other components that were used on the Falcon 1. SpaceX is also under contract with NASA to develop a vehicle called the Dragon that will be supplying cargo to the International Space Station under the Commercial Orbital Transportation Services program. This spacecraft is also intended to eventually be capable of manned spaceflight."}

Two 'provisional' patents have been filed on the technology but Keith warns there are still \"many pitfalls along the path to commercialization.\"\nUsing a process adapted from the pulp-and-paper industry that halves the cost of CO2 air capture in their custom-built tower, Professor Keith and his team captured the equivalent of about 20 tonnes per year of CO2 (approximately equal to the yearly output of one person in North America) directly from the air with less than 100 kilowatt-hours of electricity per tonne of carbon dioxide on a single square metre of scrubbing material.\n\"This means that if you used electricity from a coal-fired power plant, for every unit of electricity you used to operate the capture machine, you'd be capturing 10 times as much CO2 as the power plant emitted making that much electricity,\" explains Professor Keith.\nA report co-authored by Keith in the American Chemical Society's journal \"Environmental Science &amp; Technology \" explains \"nearly all current research on (CCS) focuses on capturing CO2 from large, stationary sources such as power plants. Such plans usually entail separating CO2 from flue gas, compressing it, and transporting it via pipeline to be [stored] underground.\"\nUsing air capture technology, \"a company could, in principle, contract with an plant near Fort McMurray to remove CO2 from the air and could build its air capture plant wherever it's cheapest \u2014 China, for example \u2014 and the same amount of CO2 would be removed,\" says Professor Keith in a UofC press release. \n\"While it's important to get started doing things we know how to do, like wind power, nuclear power, and 'regular' carbon capture and storage,\" Professor Keith continues, \"it's also vital to start thinking about radical new ideas and approaches to solving this problem.\"\nISEEE's Executive Director David Layzell points out that \"energy-efficient and cost-effective air capture could play a valuable role in complementing other approaches for reducing emissions from the transportation sector, such as biofuels or electric vehicles.\""}

A decrease in the number of sunspots may be related to an increase in hurricane intensity. After examining the past 100 year hurricane records of the United States and Caribbean, James Elsner and Thomas Jagger of Florida State University in Tallahassee conclude that their intensity may be linked to 10 to 12 year solar magnetic activity cycles. Data from the National Hurricane Center, Miami, Florida was used in the study.\nSunspots are areas on the Sun with increased magnetic activity. The number of sunspots vary during the solar cycles. The number of sunspots is predicted by NOAA to currently be the lowest in an 11 year cycle.\nIncreased solar activity will allow more ultraviolet rays to reach Earth, resulting in warming of the relatively colder upper atmosphere. Decreased solar activity reverses this phenomenon. It is believed that the greater the temperature difference between upper and lower atmospheric regions, the higher the hurricane intensity. \nEstablishing a link between sunspots and hurricane intensity can provide a valuable tool for predicting storms. Other scientists however question the statistical basis of the study and the physical processes attributed to changes in hurricane activity. \"This is something worth investigating, but they made too many assumptions for me to just accept their conclusion at this point,\" says Judy Curry of Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta."}

Scientists found traces of the HIV-1 genome collected in 1960 from a woman who lived in L\u00e9opoldville, presently called Kinshasa, the capital of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. An earlier study had also isolated the virus from a 1959 blood sample of a male from L\u00e9opoldville. Study of both the samples and estimate of the rate at which the virus mutates over time has led the researchers to conclude that the human strain could have been around for 100 years. \nThe study, co-sponsored by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the U.S. National Institutes of Health, was carried out by Michael Worobey of the University of Arizona in Tucson, Arizona and colleagues from the United States, France, Belgium, Australia, Democratic Republic of the Congo and Denmark.\nEarlier estimates of this nature had indicated the first infection in humans occurred between 1915 and 1941. The present study pushes the date of the infection back to sometime between 1884 and 1924, with a more focused estimate at 1908. Earlier studies have suggested that HIV-1 virus was spread from chimpanzees to humans in Cameroon.\n\"Now, for the first time, we have been able to compare two relatively ancient HIV strains. That helped us to calibrate how quickly the virus evolved and make some really robust inferences about when it crossed into humans, how the epidemic grew from that time, and what factors allowed the virus to enter and become a successful human pathogen,\" Dr. Worobey said. \n\"HIV is one of these pathogens that you could almost think of as living on the edge of extinction,\" Worobey continued. He believes that had HIV not been carried to a city, it may not have survived the jump to humans.\n\"It means there are things we could do to actually make it so that it doesn't have a chance of spreading,\" Worobey said.\nThe first human infection could have happened around the time when the colonial cities were established in Africa. Rapid urbanization in colonial Africa around the beginning of the twentieth century may be responsible for the spread of the AIDS pandemic. It is estimated that several thousand people were infected by the 1960s. Today, HIV infection is reported in 33 million people and has killed 25 million. Researchers opine that an understanding of the origin and pathways for human infection of the virus could help in developing a vaccine to fight it."}

They allegedly stole the ticket from Moore's then-husband.\nThe family dispute has led to Ms Moore (59) filing for divorce from her husband of ten years, Gerald Moore (81), in August. Mr Moore alleges Ms Arnold received the ticket from her mother, who took it from his bedside table. He further alleges his wife \"manipulated\" his medications to leave him incapable to grasp what was occurring. The Ontario Lottery and Gaming Corporation is also named in Mr Moore's civil suit for alleged negligence in investigating Ms Arnold's claim.\nThe bail judge's order requires Ms Moore to live with her daughter Arnold in a home she purchased with the lottery winnings, and not with her husband. As well, both women are ordered not to leave Essex County, Ontario and to surrender their passports to the police."}

Simpson, a retired American football player, former car-rental promoter, and actor, was on trial for multiple serious crimes stemming from a violent room-invasion robbery and kidnapping incident that occurred at the Palace Station resort in Las Vegas during the evening of September 13, 2007.\nSimpson was remanded and taken into custody immediately and was taken from the courtroom in handcuffs after the verdicts were read. Depending on the sentence handed down, he may end up imprisoned for the rest of his natural life.\nHe was found guilty on a total of twelve counts. Count one was for \"Conspiracy to Commit a Crime.\" This conviction could result in up to twelve years imprisonment.\nCount two was \"Conspiracy to Commit Kidnapping,\" while the third offence he was convicted of was \"Conspiracy to Commit Robbery.\" Both of these crimes will result in sentences of one to six years imprisonment.\nThe fourth count \"Burglary with a Deadly Weapon.\" This conviction could result in anything from two to fifteen years imprisonment for Simpson.\nThe fifth and sixth convictions were both for \"First-degree Kidnapping with a Deadly Weapon.\" For the two convictions combined, Simpson will receive a sentence of 30 years or life imprisonment.\nCounts seven and eight regard Robbery with a Deadly Weapon. Each conviction could result of a prison sentence of between three and 30 years.\nSection nine and ten regard assault with a deadly weapon, and they carry a penalty of one to six years imprisonment, while the final two convictions are for coercion with a deadly weapon, and carry the same penalty.\nDuring the high-profile kidnapping and robbery trial, Simpson found himself in trouble with court officials. Ordered under the terms of his bail to have no contact with fellow defendants or witnesses, he violated this in a foul-languaged message left for his bail bondsman. Miguel Pereira of \"You Ring We Spring\" received the expletive-laden message intended for his co-defendant, which the prosecutor, Chris Owens, claimed was threatening."}

This increased concern occurred due to the ongoing Cold War. \nThe script started by saying \"This is the Wartime Broadcasting Service. This country has been attacked with nuclear weapons. Communications have been severely disrupted, and the number of casualties and the extent of the damage are not yet known. We shall bring you further information as soon as possible.

Radioactive fall-out, which follows a nuclear explosion, is many times more dangerous if you are directly exposed to it in the open. Roofs and walls offer substantial protection. The safest place is indoors.\"\nThe script continued by telling citizens to \"make sure gas and other fuel supplies are turned off and that all fires are extinguished,\" before telling the listener to \"use your water only for essential drinking and cooking purposes.\" \n\"Make your food stocks last: ration your supply, because it may have to last for 14 days or more,\" continued the script. \"If you live in an area where a fall-out warning has been given, stay in your fall-out room until you are told it is safe to come out.\"\nThe script finishes people by telling people to turn off their radio to conserve energy.\nThe documents were released under Britain's Freedom of Information Act, and it also said that all reports should be given out in an authoritative and comforting tone.

At a campaign stop in Waterbury, Connecticut on Saturday, Nader said that Democrats passed up a chance to enact re-regulation of the financial system and instead gave Wall Street everything it wanted.\nAccording to Nader, Senator Chris Dodd (D-CT), Representative Barney Frank (D-MA), and other Democrats considered but rejected measures such as a tax on transactions of derivatives (a \"speculation tax\") because of their financial ties to Wall Street and its lobbyists. He said that Representative Chris Murphy (D-CT), who represents Waterbury, had \"become a toady\" of Nancy Pelosi. He drew enthusiastic applause by calling Murphy \"a dynamic fraud\", and referred to Senator Joe Lieberman as \"the Hermaphrodite of American Politics\". For Murphy and Representative Chris Shays (R-CT), Nader said, supporting the bailout despite the opposition of constituents was a \"profile in betrayal\". Because there were no public hearings where taxpayers and experts could weigh in on the bailout, Nader characterized it as a return to \"taxation without representation\"\u2014under \"King George IV\" 225 years after the 13 colonies were taxed under King George III.\nAsked about causes of the financial crisis, Nader pointed to the deregulation of the financial sector with the 1999 Glass-Steagall Act and further deregulation in 2000, as well as the rise of overly complex financial derivatives. He outlined a four-part reform plan:\nRegarding the equity warrants included in the passed bailout, Nader relayed word from an unnamed source that Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson had told Wall Street executives \"don't worry, it's not enforceable\".\nNader told reporters that he had abandoned the Green Party because \"Greens are not disciplined, and they're not mature\", and also lack the fund-raising capabilities to break into mainstream political discussions. \"They bicker and bicker,\" he said, pushing out their best people. However, he endorsed several local Green Party candidates, including Chris Murphy's opponent Harold Burbank.\nThe virtual media blackout for third party campaigns by national newspapers and networks has been a source of continual frustration for the Nader campaign, as well as the campaigns of Libertarian Bob Barr and Green Cynthia McKinney and the post-campaign activities of Republican Ron Paul. According to Nader, reporters tell him that editors of national media are \"very bigoted against third party and independent candidacies\". Even journalists for taxpayer-supported media, such as National Public Radio's Terry Gross and the Public Broadcasting Service's Jim Lehrer, have shut him out during this campaign. Debates, he lamented, are controlled by corporate interests through the Commission on Presidential Debates.\nNader spoke to a supportive crowd of about 60 people and his campaign raised over $2000 at the event, their third visit to Waterbury. The event took place in the former building of a closed-down bank."}

Following the dissolution of Thaksin's Thai Rak Thai party, and an October, 2006 election, the protesters have focused on removing what they perceive as Thaksin's ongoing influence on the country's government. In June then-PM Samak Sundaravej and his cabinet narrowly survived a no-confidence vote. Last month saw him replaced with the incumbent, Somchai Wongsawat following a court decision. Somchai was appointed as the result of a parliamentary vote, protesters are particularly incensed at this as he is former PM Thaksin's brother-in-law.\nCharges of insurrection, illegal assembly, and inciting unrest have been brought against nine of the protest leaders, including Chamlong; police have vowed to arrest all the protest leaders although there are no plans to employ force to carry this out. The charge of insurrection in Thailand is the equivalent of treason, the sentence can be life imprisonment or even the death penalty.\nGovernment proposals for the deputy prime minister, Chavalit Yongchaiyudh, to negotiate with the PAD have been scuppered by the two arrests. According to the Thai News Agency, the leaders of the PAD state that the negotiations are unlikely to take place now.

The book is a critical assessment of the prize's history and the political committee and process which now awards the prize. Heffermehl compares the works of all the Peace Prize Laureates to date with his interpretation of the intentions and will of the prize's founder.\nIn the book, the author asserts that Stortinget (the Norwegian Parliament), has in effect broken Norwegian and Swedish law by failing to follow the intentions of Nobel's will. It is the Norwegian parliament which selects the five members of the committee which decide on the recipients of the Peace Prize. \nAlfred Nobel was a Swedish chemist and industrialist that built a fortune on dynamite after having invented it and patented the process. Alfred Nobel spent many years finalising his will, and had close contact with Bertha von Suttner, an upper-class peace activist, during parts of the process. While Swedish institutions were trusted with the choosing of recipients of prizes for chemistry, physics, medicine and literature, Nobel decided that a Norwegian institution should choose the recipient of the price for peace. \nHeffermehl claims that the reason was the anti-militaristic stance of leading forces in the Norwegian parliament. One year prior to his death, Nobel finalised his will in 1895. \nThe relevant portion of the will, stating the criteria for what has later become known as the \"Nobel Peace Prize\" is :\nAccording to Heffermehl, prior to World War II about 85% of recipients were awarded in accordance with the will, but since the end of the war only 45% of the recipients fit the criteria. Recent recipients Al Gore and the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change do not suit the requirements, according to the author. Neither do Muhammad Yunus and his Grameen Bank, nor Wangari Maathai. \n\"Disarmament and anti-militarism was what Nobel wanted to promote,\" says Heffermehl to Aftenposten.\nGeir Lundestad, Director of the Nobel Institute and secretary of the Norwegian Nobel Committee has said he does not wish to enter into a debate with Heffermehl due to potential political and legal actions from Heffermehl.\nHeffermehl denies having any plans for political or legal action: In Aftenposten he is quoted as saying to the newsagency NTB : \"I have no idea what Lundestad is thinking of. I have no plans about taking action, legal or political, against the Committee. This is not an attack, but an exhortation to look at a number of questions\".\nCritical disputes and protests of Nobel Prize awards, especially of the Peace prize, are as predictable as the prize itself. Of particular note has been that Mahatma Gandhi never received the prize, but the committee tacitly admitted this error when in 1948, the year of Gandhi's death, they elected to not award the Peace Prize saying \"there was no suitable living candidate\", referring to an interpretation of Nobel's will, to the effect that the prizes be awarded to living persons. It should be noted, however, that Dag Hammarskj\u00f6ld was given the award shortly after his death in 1961, having died in (peacemaking) action as it were. \nThe Danish newspaper \"Information\" has received further comments from the chairman of the Nobel Committee, Ole Danbolt Mj\u00f8s. His reply is in three parts: Firstly, the Committee has interpreted the three items in the portion of the will describing the scope of the price as three separate items, and they are confident that they can be interpreted separate from each other, each as a sufficient criteria for the prize. Heffermehl contends that they should primarily be seen as an integral whole. Secondly, the committee chairman points to the tradition that has evolved. Lastly he also says that deliberate re-interpretations and widening of the criteria for the prize has taken place during the latter years, in view of a modern understanding of the underpinnings of peace.

Bush deployed the 3rd Infantry Division's 1st Brigade Combat Team to a new role on United States soil last Wednesday, training for dealing with national crises. Critics claim that act of the Executive Branch violates the Posse Comitatus Act, which prohibits military participation in domestic matters.\nIn 2007, the John Warner National Defense Authorization Act was introduced; it overturned the Posse Comitatus Act by allowing the Commander in Chief to suppress 'insurrection' and 'restore order'. When it was repealed in 2008, Bush stated that he did not respect the later repeal.\nThe combat team, renamed CCMRF (C-hemical, biological, radiological, nuclear and high-yield explosive C-onsequence M-anagement R-esponse F-orces), has been assigned for year-long duty and training at Fort Stewart to prepare them for \"civil unrest and crowd control or to deal with potentially horrific scenarios\" such as security or natural disasters. After a year, a new unit will take its place.\nCCMRF will be under the control of the Northern Command (NORTHCOM), and now has the same legal authority as a unit deployed to Iraq under the direct control of the Executive Branch. The unit will have use of engineer and medical units, the Marine Corps Chemical, Biological Initial Reaction Force, and a Navy weather team, as well as members of the Defense Logistics Agency and the Defense Threat Reduction Agency. A spokeswoman for NORTHCOM added that both wheeled and tank vehicles would be available for the CCMRF. \nIn July the unit was assigned a new commander, Col. Roger Cloutier. \"If we go in,\" he said proudly of the deployment, \"we\u2019re going in to help American citizens on American soil\". CCMRF will be training in both traffic and riot control equipment, and will be the first to use the Army's new nonlethal package, which is intended for war-zone and not domestic use. \nNORTHCOM's September 30th statement includes a quote attributed to \"future operations division chief\" Colonel Michael Boatner saying, \u201cThis response force will not be called upon to help with law enforcement, civil disturbance or crowd control, but will be used to support lead agencies involved in saving lives, relieving suffering and meeting the needs of communities affected by weapons of mass destruction attacks, accidents or even natural disasters.\u201d \nThe action has raised concerns for some citizens like journalist Naomi Wolf, an author critical of the Bush administration, who referred to the deployment as a 'coup' in a well-circulated viral video and issued Americans a call to action.\nNORTHCOM is a joint command established post-9/11 to provide command and control for federal homeland defense efforts and coordinate defense support of civil authorities. When Hurricane Katrina damaged Mississippi and Louisiana, several active-duty units were pulled from various posts and mobilized to those areas, but were not assigned to NORTHCOM, but instead individual commands under provisional authorities. \nMilitary officials have not yet responded to a request for comment."}

Those talks helped pave the way for Namibia's independence from South Africa.\nAhtisaari began his career as a school teacher before joining Finland's foreign ministry. He served as a United Nations undersecretary and secretary of state for the Finnish foreign ministry before being elected president of Finland in 1994.\nAhtisaari founded the Crisis Management Initiative in 2000.

Norwegian lawyer, author and activist, Fredrik Heffermehl published a book criticising the interpretation of the will of Nobel, just a few days prior to October 10. His interpretation is that human rights activists do not fall within the scope of the prize. Even peace mediators fall on the very edge, if the intentions of Alfred Nobel are to be taken seriously. Heffermehl points to former United States senator Sam Nunn as a long-term and 2008 nominee to the Nobel Peace Prize, that has worked much more clearly in line with the will of Nobel. Sam Nunn is an activist for disarmament of Soviets arsenals left in Russia.\nSome commentators of the 2008 Nobel Peace Prize, criticise the Committee, for not daring to stand up to the Chinese. The Danish peace researcher \u00d8berg, however criticises the choice of Ahtisaari, the recipient of the prize for 2008, because of his role in the Balkans, claiming that the work of Ahtisaari added to hostilities there, instead of reducing them. Furthermore \u00d8berg, says the Nobel Peace Committee is not comprised of experts in the relevant field, unlike the committees for the scientific prizes."}

We are a prosperous nation with immense resources and a wide range of tools at our disposal.

Canadian households have smaller mortgages relative both to the value of their homes and to their disposable incomes than in the U.S.\"\n\"\"However, it is becoming increasingly clear that the continuing disruption of global credit markets, which has been severe and protracted, is making it difficult for our financial institutions to raise long-term funding. This is beginning to affect the availability of mortgage loans and other types of credit in Canada,\" he continued. \"The Government has therefore decided to act to address the current scarcity of private sector lending to Canadian mortgage markets and lending markets overall. This is going to make loans and mortgages more available and more affordable for ordinary Canadians and businesses.\""}

The pressure came after a hostile divorce between the governor's sister and ex-husband, who was accused of threatening the family.\nThe governor's explanations of her reasons for firing Monegan had been inconsistent, from denying a \"personality conflict\" to insubordination and incompetence. She consistently denied, however, the firing being related to Wooten.\n\"The Palins make no apologies,\" a statement released by her campaign said, \"for wanting to protect their family and wanting to bring attention to the injustice of a violent trooper keeping his badge and abusing the workers' compensation system\".\nWhile the investigative committee had agreed unanimously to release the report, a few Republicans on the panel had attempted to halt the investigation, citing political bias.

Tuesday's protest, where attempts were made to block MPs access to and from parliament, turned ugly when police employed tear gas and other measures to disperse the PAD crowd. Two protesters died, over four hundred were injured, and reports indicate that as many as ten may be missing. The ongoing protests and demonstrations are aimed at toppling the governing People's Power Party (PPP) who are accused of being a proxy for deposed prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra's outlawed Thai Rak Thai party.\nFriday saw the remaining seven PAD protest leaders surrender to police and be issued on bail. Leaders Chamlong Srimuang and Chaiwat Sinuwong were also bailed, having been arrested and detained earlier. This follows the charges of treason being thrown out by the country's appeals court; lesser charges, including inciting unrest, still stand.\nThe activist political group, founded by media firebrand Sondhi Limthongkul has occupied Government house for some time now, their demands are for a revision of the Thai political landscape which would see professionals and those in the more prosperous parts of the country a bigger say in the government. Outstanding charges of corruption against Thaksin Shinawatra who the military removed from power in September 2007 are the result of Sondhi and the PAD's long-standing battle against what they view as vote-buying populist policies. Questionable land deals and allegations of neoptism saw an increasing number of people becoming involved in protests prior to the 2007 coup.\nThe ongoing crisis has impacted the country both domestically and internationally. The deputy prime minister, Chavalit Yongchaiyudh resigned on Friday for his part in ordering the police into action against protesters blockading parliament. In an interview with the Bangkok Post, the former general implied the solution - once again - lies with the army, and suggested a second coup may be the only solution to the crisis. Army chief, Anupong Paochinda, faced scorn from the PAD following his dismissal of the call for a second coup; this despite his issuing harsh criticism of the current administration.\nOn the international front, Thailand's troubles saw the Prime Minister, Somchai Wongsawat, cancel a number of foreign visits. The beleaguered PM had planned to visit five ASEAN partner countries in a tour that would have started next week. Additional trips to Laos, Cambodia, and Myanmar (formerly Burma) were cancelled. According to a member of the PPP this is due to the current unrest.\nAdding to the woes of the ruling PPP, the Attorney General's office has asked for a ruling from the country's Constitutional Court outlawing the People's Power Party. Office spokesman, Thanapit Mulpruek, outlined the content of the petition specifying that the key 37 leaders of the PPP should have their voting rights revoked for five years in light of the allegations of election fraud, or knowingly allowing such to continue. The party's former deputy leader was disqualified during the December 2007 general election, being accused of graft. The party's members of parliament are scheduled to meet Monday to discuss this issue and the ongoing political crisis."}

Video footage from airport security cameras shows the airliner travelling across an unusually long distance of runway before take-off. It failed to maintain altitude and quickly dropped back down at the runway's end, before bursting into a fireball. Just eighteen people survived the accident.\nThe report confirms that the aircraft failed to get beyond forty feet off the ground before entering a stall and crashing. The tail of the jet struck the ground first, and the Spanish Civil Aviation Accident Investigation Commission (CIAIAC)'s report also notes that the aircraft was carrying 10,130 litres (2,673 gallons) of fuel.\nThe wing flaps were \"fully retracted\" at \"0 degrees\" according to the 12-page report, which also notes that the cockpit voice recorder indicates a complete failure of the take-off warning system (TOWS) - which is supposed to alert pilots attempting to take off in a plane that is not properly configured - to sound prior to the failed ascent. Spanair checks the TOWS each day and after every change in flight crew, but neither of these occurred between the accident flight and the flight before.\nIt is not known when the CIAIAC's final report will be ready, but estimates vary from a few months to two years. The latest report notes \"The investigation continues. It will be necessary to carry out tests and an exhaustive examination of the recovered parts of the plane.\" A separate judicial investigation also continues."}

While Britain feels Iceland should also pay out to their citizens, Iceland blame the UK for triggering the crisis by using the Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001 to freeze the UK assets of Icelandic banks.\nUK Prime Minister Gordon Brown says Iceland should pay out up to \u20ac20,887 (\u00a316,448) of UK investors' money in the banks, particularly Icesave, an online company owned by Landsbanki which had around 300,000 accounts owned by UK customers. It will cost an estimated 2.4 billion pounds to compensate them, and it looks likely the UK will foot that bill.\nAlistair Darling, the U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer, has said that individuals with accounts will see their money again but other accounts are not guaranteed - leaving governmental, corporate and charitable deposits at risk of being lost. UK local authorities could lose \u00a3799 million.\n\"The prime minister made clear the behavior of the Icelandic authorities had been unacceptable, and we had found it very difficult to get information from them,\" said Michael Ellam, a spokesperson for Brown. A delegation has been sent to Reykjavik from the UK to try and solve the dispute amicably.\nHowever, fears that the crisis may escalate have led to the pound becoming heavily devalued. The pound hit its lowest level for five years versus the US dollar after Brown threatened to freeze the assets of all Icelandic companies in the UK, which employ around 100,000 people.\nThe last time the two nations had a dispute, dubbed the Cod Wars, was in the 1970s. Iceland declared an exclusive fishing zone and began to cut the nets of British trawlers entering the area. That dispute came to a head in 1976 when a UK naval vessel with nuclear arms rammed an Icelandic ship that had been cutting nets. After this a compromise was reached to allow a limited number of British ships in the area."}

So the Federal Reserve has injected hundreds of billions of dollars into the system. The Fed has joined with central banks around the world to coordinate a cut in interest rates -- a step that should help free up credit. The Fed has also announced a new program to provide support for a vital tool that many American businesses use to finance their day-to-day operations -- the commercial paper market, which is freezing up. As this program kicks in over the next week or so, it will help revive a key source of short-term financing for businesses and financial institutions.\"\n\"Second, some Americans are concerned about whether their money is safe,\" continued the president. \"So the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the National Credit Union Administration have significantly expanded the amount of money insured in savings accounts and checking accounts and certificates of deposit.

Slice's announced opponent, legendary mixed martial arts and professional wrestling veteran , was declared medically ineligible to fight after injuring himself during a Saturday morning workout session, requiring stitches to be applied to a cut over his eye. News of the injury and substitution was not made until after started broadcasting the show. \nThe show had been heavily promoted over the last two months on Shamrock's reputation and the credibility of his name, along with the media buzz around Kimbo Slice. CBS Sports was expecting to cash in with a huge ratings success after securing a record-setting 4.85 million viewers on their inaugural broadcast of EliteXC, the highest ratings ever for a MMA broadcast. Fourteen seconds into the main event, however, Petruzelli scored an upset win over Slice. Petruzelli hit Slice with a right cross to Slice's jaw that sent the phenom staggering backwards. Petruzelli moved in, as Slice was not defending himself, and finished off his opponent with a flurry of punches. The referee stopped the fight a few seconds later. \nThe controversy started the next morning after Petruzelli was interviewed on the \"\" radio show on 104.1 in Orlando, FL and simulcast on channel . In the 18-minute interview, Petruzelli made the statement, \"The promoters kind of hinted to me and they gave me the money to stand and trade with him. They didn't want me to take him down, let's just put it that way. It was worth my while to try to stand up and punch with him.\" \nIt was inferred through this statement that an EliteXC official approached Petruzelli and attempted to influence the outcome of the fight. Slice, whose fight strategy is largely based on punching power, had been training to face Shamrock, another noted strike artist. Petruzelli, on the other hand, has a much stronger ground offensive. Critics during the fight noted that if Petruzelli could force Slice to the mat that it would be a humiliating upset, but if Slice could maintain control through his striking it would be an easy win. \nWith the statement from Petruzelli about being paid to stand up and fight on Slice's skill level, allegations of tampering with the fight began to arise within hours. EliteXC's Jeremy Lappin, Director of Fight Operations, responded to 's inquiries, saying \"Press reports that EliteXC suggested or paid money to heavyweight fighter Seth Petruzelli to keep his fight against Kimbo Slice off the ground are false. Let me be perfectly clear with no ambiguity \u2013 that did not happen.\" Lappin stated that they offered him a \"Knockout of the Night\" bonus if he could score a win by KO. Bonuses such as \"Knockout of the Night\", \"Submission of the Night\" and \"Match of the Night\" are often offered to fighters who can deliver entertaining and crowd-pleasing performances. Lappin also stated, \"Elite XC organizes and promotes fights. We have not, do not, and will not suggest or dictate fighters' strategies or tactics. How the fighters perform in the cage is at the sole discretion of the athletes involved.\"\nPetruzelli also started making immediate amends the next day, blaming himself for misrepresenting his intentions. In a blitz of media interviews in an effort to retracts his statement, he said, \"Honestly, when I woke up in the morning my words were jumbled and obviously my head was in a daze from drinking (laughs) the entire night. Reading the transcript, I actually now feel I worded it perfectly in what I wanted to say. I wanted to keep the fight standing and they offered a knockout bonus and I wanted to get the knockout bonus.\"\nFlorida officials from the Department of Business and Professional Regulation (DBPR) did not appear to be interested in performing an investigation. In an interview with MMAWeekly.com, DBPR press secretary Alexis Antonacci said, \"Our interpretation is that the comments made were in reference to the promoter asking [Petruzelli] to join a fight that he wasn\u2019t originally scheduled for. We don\u2019t believe any wrongdoing occurred.\" The DBPR regulates all business and professional licenses in the state, including promotion of sports such as boxing, professional wrestling and mixed martial arts.\nAfter being hounded by the media and fight critics all week long, the DPBR announced on Thursday that they would start a preliminary investigation. Communications director Jennifer Meale made a statement to the press. \"While the Department of Business and Professional Regulation doesn't have any reason to believe there was a problem with the Slice-Petruzelli fight, given the interest in it, the Department has begun a preliminary investigation to thoroughly review the circumstances of the fight.\" \nPro Elite, Inc, the parent company of EliteXC, has struggled over the last year. The company is over $50 million in debt, with $24.4 million of that debt accrued in the first half of 2008. Trailing behind industry leader Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC), EliteXC has rallied behind Kimbo Slice to drive up ratings on their specials with CBS Sports and Showtime Networks, attendance at live events and other merchandise sales. The October 4 broadcast drew in 4.56 million viewers, making it the third most-watched viewed event in MMA history to go along with its record-setting May 31 debut of 4.85 million viewers. Both events featured Kimbo Slice in the main event.\nThe corruption issue could go deeper than just fixing a fight for the company's star fighter. Further fueling the allegations are the actions of EliteXC's president, Jared Shaw. Immediately after the fight was stopped, Shaw rushed to the side of the cage and yelled to the referee that Slice was hit illegally.\n\"He spent a lot of money to build up Kimbo,\" Seth Petruzelli said. \"If I saw one of my guys I spent millions on getting his face pounded I\u2019d get upset also.\" Shaw later apologized for his actions, calling them improper. \nEliteXC's Lappin told ESPN, \"We were not trying to protect Kimbo. He had been training to fight a guy in Shamrock who has a better ground game than Seth. If we were trying to protect Kimbo we would have sent him home. We put him in a dangerous fight.\" , MMA color analyst for CBS Sports, and brother of Ken Shamrock, feels that EliteXC is looking out for Slice's best interests. \"As for Pro Elite, are they looking after their baby? I hope so. Are they conspiring to ensure he wins? I don't think so.\" "}

This is the second such initiative within the week, the letter on 7 October being signed by 120 scientists.\nThe scientists signing the latest letter represent hundreds of researchers such as Deans, Department Heads, Research Chairs, and research team leaders. They come from academic fields of Anthropology, Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences, Biology, Community Health and Epidemiology, Criminology, Earth &amp; Ocean Sciences, Educational Psychology, Environmental &amp; Engineering Sciences, Land Resource Science, Medicine, Nursing, Philosophy, Physics, Psychiatry, Social Work, and Sociology.\nQueen's University climate researcher John Smol lamented the need for scientists to protest in a public forum. \"I think scientists tend to be conservative when it comes to voicing their opinions. But as far as the environment is concerned, the problem is so bad and the consequences are so terrible if we do not act,\" he told CBC News.\nThe Harper government was cited for actions across the academic spectrum, from nuclear safety to human health to climate science. A repeated charge is misreprestation and/or suppression of scientific finds, as well as acting to prevent the dissemination of research, to silence scientists.\nWithin the government's own Environment Canada the Conservatives have been accused of muzzling the department, even interfering with the release of one researcher's science fiction novel. The novel, entitled \"\"Hotter than Hell\", deals with a not-too-distant future strongly affected by global warming. Then-Environmental Minister Rona Ambrose ordered the scientist not to attend talks to promote his novel where his job title was given.\n\u201cIt\u2019s absolutely Orwellian what\u2019s going on here in science in Canada,\u201d said environmental scientist Andrew Weaver in an interview with \"The Georgia Straight\". Weaver, lead author on three Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change reports and the recently published \"Keeping Our Cool: Canada in a Warming World\"\", was not surprised when references to the UN's IPCC reports were removed from Canadian government websites. He wrote in his book about new rules the Harper government put in place, requiring journalist questions for Environment Canada scientists be submitted in writing, and responses must first be presented to media-relations staff for editing and approval.\nVancouver's Safe Injections Site project, Insite, a program designed to provide intravenous drug users with a medically-supervised location, is an internationally recognized model of successful harm-reduction public health policy, supported by both provincial and municipal governments. The national police force, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, engaged in a campaign to undermine the project according to documents discovered in a Freedom of Information Act query, including financing politically-motivated research.\nThe conservative government has been antagonistic to the program since coming to power, and though losing its case at every level of courts has appealed the Supreme Court of British Columbia ruling which struck down portions of Canada's drug laws as unconstitutional.

As foreclosures increase both locally and throughout the United States, the one year old ordinance has become a model for other cities overwhelmed by the problem of abandoned homes that decay into neighborhood eyesores. \nChula Vista city code enforcement manager Doug Leeper told the \"San Diego Union Tribune\" that over 300 jurisdictions have contacted his office during the past year with inquiries about the city's tough local ordinance. Coral Springs, Florida, and California towns Stockton, Santee, Riverside County, and Murietta have all modeled recently enacted anti-blight measures after Chula Vista's. On Wednesday, 8 October, the Escondido City Council also voted to tighten local measures making lenders more accountable for maintenance of empty homes.\nUnder the Chula Vista ordinance lenders become legally responsible for upkeep as soon as a notice of mortgage default gets filed on a vacant dwelling, before actual ownership of the dwelling returns to the lender. Leeper regards that as \"the cutting-edge part of our ordinance\". Chula Vista also requires prompt registration of vacant homes and applies stiff fines as high as US$1000 per day for failure to maintain a property. Since foreclosed properties are subject to frequent resale between mortgage brokers, city officials enforce the fines by sending notices to every name on title documents and placing a lien on the property, which prevents further resale until outstanding fines have been paid. In the year since the ordinance went into effect the city has applied $850,000 in fines and penalties, of which it has collected $200,000 to date. The city has collected an additional $77,000 in registration fees on vacant homes.\nJolie Houston, an attorney in San Jose, believes \"Lenders will respond when it costs them less to maintain the property than to ignore local agency requirements.\" Traditionally, local governments have resorted to addressing blight problems on abandoned properties with public funds, mowing overgrown lawns and performing other vital functions, then seeking repayment afterward. Chula Vista has moved that responsibility to an upfront obligation upon lenders. \nAs one of the fastest growing cities in the United States during recent years, Chula Vista saw 22.6% growth between 2000 and 2006, which brought the city's population from 173,556 in the 2000 census to an estimated 212,756, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Chula Vista placed among the nation's 20 fastest growing cities in 2004. A large proportion of local homes were purchased during the recent housing boom using creative financing options that purchasers did not understand were beyond their means. Average home prices in San Diego County declined by 25% in the last year, which is the steepest drop on record. Many homeowners in the region currently owe more than their homes are worth and confront rising balloon payment mortgages that they had expected to afford by refinancing new equity that either vanished or never materialized. In August 2008, Chula Vista's eastern 91913 zip code had the highest home mortgage default rate in the county with 154 filings and 94 foreclosures, an increase of 154% over one year previously. Regionally, the county saw 1,979 foreclosures in August.\nProfessionals from the real estate and mortgage industries object to Chula Vista's response to the crisis for the additional burdens it places on their struggling finances. Said San Diego real estate agent Marc Carpenter, \"that kind of measure will add additional costs to banks that have been hit really hard already and ultimately the cost will be transferred down to consumers and investors.\" Yet city councils in many communities have been under pressure to do something about increasing numbers of vacant properties. Concentrations of abandoned and neglected homes can attract vandals who hasten the decline of struggling neighborhoods. Jolie Houston explained that city officials \"can't fix the lending problem, but they can try to prevent neighborhoods from becoming blighted.\" \nCEO Robert Klein of Safeguard, a property management firm, told the \"Union Tribune\" that his industry is having difficulty adapting to the rapidly changing local ordinances. \"Every day we discover a new ordinance coming out of somewhere\", he complained. Dustin Hobbs, a spokesman from the California Association of Mortgage Bankers agreed that uneven local ordinances are likely to increase the costs of lending. Hobbs advised that local legislation is unnecessary due to California State Senate Bill 1137, which was recently approved to address blight. Yet according to Houston, the statewide measure falls short because it fails to address upkeep needs during the months between the time when foreclosure begins and when the lender takes title."}

NorthComm says that these troops will be used to protect the United States from threats within the United States, as well as to provide a support role to local and state agencies during times of emergency, such as with Hurricane Katrina. \nCritics, however, believe that moving an active military unit back to United States soil represents a violation of the Posse Comitatus Act of 1878, which makes it illegal for federal military resources to act as law enforcement agencies against civilians. The article included citations from critic Namoi Watts, who based part of her opinion on an interview with retired U.S. Air Force Colonel David Antoon. Ret. Col. Antoon stated that a military coup was already under way through the actions of NorthComm, and that other branches of the government would be powerless. \nWikinews reporter Kevin Fields had an opportunity to speak with an active duty member of the United States Army, a sergeant who is currently deployed to a peace keeping mission in Iraq. Federal laws officially prevents him from giving making any statement on military policy, however he agreed to do so on the condition of anonymity.

Or would such a case clearly violate it, but nothing can be done about it?\nKevin Fields: What would be the difference?\nKevin Fields: Critics have suggested that this is part of a strategy to usurp power and consolidate it in the Presidency. Is it possible for a President of the United States to stage a coup by deploying the CCMRF and NorthComm to permanently take over an area where there is rioting or a national disaster?\nKevin Fields: So even though this unit, and NorthComm, are under the direct command of the President, Congress can still stop his actions?\nKevin Fields: Critics say that such hearings would not be swift, and that such action would not directly affect the President or any action he takes through this unit.

Presiding over the ceremonies, the queen was accompanied by army chief Anupong Paojinda (Thai: \u0e2d\u0e19\u0e38\u0e1e\u0e07\u0e29\u0e4c \u0e40\u0e1c\u0e48\u0e32\u0e08\u0e34\u0e19\u0e14\u0e32), the opposition Democrat party leader, Abhisit Vejjajiva (Thai: \u0e2d\u0e20\u0e34\u0e2a\u0e34\u0e17\u0e18\u0e34\u0e4c \u0e40\u0e27\u0e0a\u0e0a\u0e32\u0e0a\u0e35\u0e27\u0e30), and newly elected Bangkok Governor, Apirak Kosayodhin (Thai: \u0e2d\u0e20\u0e34\u0e23\u0e31\u0e01\u0e29\u0e4c \u0e42\u0e01\u0e29\u0e30\u0e42\u0e22\u0e18\u0e34\u0e19).

He later discussed their conversation, detailing that the queen had given moral support and said that his daughter was a decent person who had been helping the King and working for the good of the nation. Jinda's wife, Angkhana's mother, was not present at the funeral; she continues to be treated for injuries sustained during the protest outside parliament. The Bangkok Post report detailing this meeting mentions that the king has donated funds to help those injured in the police clampdown.\nAt the closing of the funeral services there were scuffles between PAD protesters and the Army's Commander-in-Chief, Anupong Paojinda, as he attempted to leave. Security guards had to assist him in reaching his car and protesters banged on the car as it drove away.\nWith a sub-committee appointed by the country's Human Rights Commission due to report within the week, details are beginning to emerge accounting for the number of injuries and severity of some in last Tuesday's clashes outside parliament. Nearly 500 were injured as police employed tear gas to try and disperse the crowd of PAD protesters blockading parliament. The group, originally formed seeking to topple deposed former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra and his Thai Rak Thai party, had disbanded in September 2006 following Thaksin being removed by a coup. The 2007 general election saw them reform to oppose the new government formed by the People's Power Party (PPP) who are widely regarded as a proxy for the ex-PM living in exile in the UK. The PAD protest aimed to stop the PPP government from announcing their legislative programme which included measures to amend the constitution and rehabilitate Thaksin and others from the now-outlawed Thai Rak Thai party. Investigations started during the coup period leave Thaksin and others accused of vote buying and electoral fraud.\nPorntip Rojanasunan, the director of Thailand's Central Institute of Forensic Science has indicated that the tear gas employed was likely responsible for the many injuries during the October 7 crackdown. A number of the canisters were found to contain RDX, a militarily employed explosive. RDX is considered a powerful explosive and the quantities likely involved would have left craters. Other types of tear gas were employed, manufactured in the United States and Spain, but during the protest it was the RDX-laced variety which originated in China that had been favoured. Porntip's agency demonstrated the firing of these tear gas canisters from a shotgun to the Human Rights Commission committee on Sunday, noting that one exploded canister \"left a hole in a metal pipe\". It is claimed that the lethal tear gas was sourced from a third party and not directly from China.\nAlong with the two fatalities, fifteen people remain hospitalised from last week's police action, with one critically injured having lost his right arm.\nMonday's planned PAD protest and march on Bangkok police HQ was cancelled to allow people to attend the cremation and funeral services for the two dead. No new date for the protest has been announced."}

University of California, San Francisco found that only 44% of patients who undergo an elective cardiac surgery called angioplasty get the recommended test to determine whether the procedure is appropriate.\nAs a result, patients may be receiving a procedure that they either do not need or for which the risk outweighs the benefit. The operation opens partially clogged arteries in patients with heart disease and the annual rate of elective angioplasties has tripled in the United States during the last decade. \nAngioplasties are currently being performed at a rate of over 800,000 per year in the U.S. The average cost was $44,110 per procedure in 2004. Since the operation tends to be performed on older Americans, Medicare covers most patients and compensates US$10,000 to $15,000 for each case.\nReuters reporter Julie Steenhuysen writes that angioplasty is \"big business for medical device makers including Boston Scientific Corp, Medtronic Inc, Abbott Laboratories Inc and Johnson &amp; Johnson\". Dr. Raymond Gibbons, a professor of medicine who specializes in cardiology at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, criticizes the current U.S. health care system for compensating doctors based upon procedures performed rather than for following recommended practices.\nA stress test in which the patient walks on a treadmill is recommended to determine whether a partial obstruction impairs heart function. Although not all patients who need angioplasty are strong enough to undergo the stress test, UC San Francisco researchers were surprised that testing preceded so few of the surgeries.\nProfessor of medicine Dr. Rita F. Redberg told \"U.S. News and World Report\", \"We didn't expect to find 100 percent, but we expected a much higher percentage than 44\". Dr. Redberg co-authored a report on the findings for the \"Journal of the American Medical Association\" this month.\nDr. Grace Lin, another co-author of the study, noted: \"What really matters is whether or not that blockage is affecting blood flow to the heart. That is why the stress test is important.\" Their research analyzed over 23,000 Medicare cases and over 1,600 commercial insurance cases.\nAmerican Heart Association president Timothy Gardner called the study \"a good wake-up call\" to remind medical doctors to make sure they do not perform unnecessary procedures. Dr. Gardner regards the study as evidence that many unnecessary angioplasties are being performed.\nThe study found great variation in the rate of stress testing. Geographic areas ranged from 22% to 76% with the highest rate of testing in the Northeastern and Midwestern states. Testing rates also varied by gender, with men more likely to receive a stress test than women, and by other factors including the age of the physician. Dr. Gibbons points to some of these variances as indications that some physicians may be performing angioplasties indiscriminately.\nNot all physicians agree. Although the various types of stress testing usually cost a few hundred dollars instead of tens of thousands, the chief cardiologist at University of Wisconsin Hospital and Clinics Dr. Matthew Wolff notes that stress tests yield false negative results in about 10% of cases. In his opinion, doctors who rely on stress tests \"are going to be missing people with severe disease.\" Although he agrees that some angioplasties are unnecessary, he contends that the new study does not offer a solution to the dilemma. \nThe American College of Cardiology plans to release new guidelines soon to help doctors determine when a stress test is appropriate, yet the payment system lacks a financial incentive to abide by testing guidelines. Dr. Eric Topol of Scripps Translational Science Institute in La Jolla, California noted the underuse of stress tests in a study of private insurance records 14 years ago. Dr. Topol agrees that testing guidelines \"should be much more clear-cut\", and adds that stress tests ought to be performed annually. \"You can do a stress test every year to be sure things are normal. That is an important baseline that is being ignored all too frequently.\"\nCardiologist, Dr. Anthony DeFranco of Aurora St. Luke\u2019s Medical Center, considers stress testing to be appropriate in at most 65% of cases, since a substantial minority of patients have other health problems that prevent them from undergoing the test."}

Financial experts believe that next year, the deficit will reach over $700 billion, while the National Debt Clock has recently run out of digits to record over $10 trillion in national debt.\nThe deficit is now equivalent to 3.2% of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of the United States, with the government's total income being 17.8% of GDP, and total outlays being equivalent to 21% of GDP.\nTreasury Secretary Henry Paulson blamed the deficit on the housing market, related markets, and slow growth. He said the news would \"reinforce the need to not only address short-term challenges, but pursue policies that promote economic growth and fiscal responsibility, and address entitlement reform\". \nDemocrats like Senator Kent Conrad, however, placed the blame on \"President Bush's failed policies\". \"The reality is that the next president will be inheriting a fiscal and economic mess of historic proportions,\" said Conrad, adding that \"it will take years to dig our way out\". \nAnother Democrat, House Budget Committee Chairman John Spratt, also blamed the Bush administration. \"The eight years of this administration will include the five biggest budget deficits in history,\" he said. \"The resulting debt will be passed to our children and grandchildren.\"\nJim Nussle, director of the Office of Management and Budget said that he believes that the deficit will start to decline. \"The bipartisan stimulus bill and the slow economy are the primary reasons for the increase in deficit as reflected in this year's budget results. This increase reinforces the need to adopt and maintain policies that promote economic growth and fiscal responsibility, including entitlement reform and pro-growth tax policies.

Following on from a string of corruption charges, the latest centres on the country's telecommunications industry. The former Prime Minister was removed by a bloodless military coup in September 2006 while at the United Nations in New York. Prior to the coup the country experienced widespread unrest, demonstrations, and allegations against Thaksin and his Thai Rak Thai party of corruption and vote buying.\nThe warrant is over Thaksin's failure to appear in court on charges relating to conversion of concession payments in the country's lucrative telecoms market to excise tax during 2003; a move that is estimated to have cost the country's exchequer 40 billion baht (US$1.2 billion). The deposed PM remains in self-imposed exile in London, having been there since August. At that time he and his wife left Thailand whilst on bail related to the charges surrounding the Ratchadaphisek land purchase deal. The deal saw Thaksin's wife, Khunying Potjaman purchase what is considered a prime piece of real estate for 772 million baht ($22.7 million) at auction; this price was described as a bargain. At this point the ex-PM has not been convicted on any of the charges, although his wife, Khunying, faces a jail sentence.\nNext Tuesday, will see the trial over the Ratchadaphisek land case again come before the Supreme Court\u2014this time with a verdict possibly to be read. This could be deferred due to the defendants' absence, but a guilty verdict could see Thaksin facing jail time should he return to Thailand.\nLast month, saw other warrants issued against Thaksin, in relation to the country's numbers lottery. Malfeasance allegations led to charges over the sale of two and three digit numbers during the 2001-2006 period of his time in office as Prime Minister. The trial, currently suspended by the Criminal Division for Holders of Political Office, will resume and examine further evidence in December.\nThe ongoing controversy surrounding Thaksin has seen calls for his diplomatic passport to be revoked. The movement for the coveted red passport to be withdrawn started in mid-September with Thai air force chief, Chalit Phukpasuk, referencing the then-outstanding warrants and widespread lack of respect for the former PM stated, \"he has now fallen from grace, he no longer deserves such an honour\". The general, who retired at the end of September, condemned Thaksin for failing to appear in court and defend himself. The newly appointed Foreign Minister and deputy PM has washed his hands of the diplomatic passport issue, preferring to pass this off as an issue for the Prime Minister himself. The military junta of Surayud Chulanont had revoked the passport, but this decision was revoked by the democratically elected Foreign Minister when civilian government was restored.\nAdding to the public pressure on the former PM, Thailand's armed forces' supreme commander, Boonsrang Niempradit, called on the current Prime Minister Somchai Wongsawat to ensure appropriate justice was meted out to Thaksin. Boonsrang asserted the prime minister must, \"dispense justice to everyone, ensuring justice does not necessarily mean offering assistance. Sometimes, justice involves meting out punishment as well\". Current PM Somchai, brother-in-law of exiled Thaksin, has his own legal worries that could see him removed from office and parliament; charges against him centre round a share scandal. His holdings in a telecoms company which does business with the state are allegedly in contravention of several constitutional articles."}

Several hours of talks have led to an agreement for joint military patrols along the disputed border.\nWednesday's exchange of fire in the disputed border region surrounding Preah Vihear Temple is the latest in a dispute over an area of scrubland which both Cambodia and Thailand claim. While each side claims the other initiated the clash, government officials in both capitals have sought to downplay the seriousness of the incident and stress that a negotiated settlement is the only reasonable solution. The disputed territory is a little under five square kilometres and was, in 1962, awarded to Cambodia by the International Court of Justice. The decision caused resentment in Thailand which continues to this day.\nDownplaying the incident, Cambodian Foreign Minister Hor Namhong spoke of the negotiations in positive terms, stressing the skirmish was, \"an incident between soldiers and not an invasion by Thailand\". Thai Prime Minister, Somchai Wongsawat stressed the need for the dispute over territory to be resolved peacefully.\nAccording to officials, apart from the two Cambodian soldiers who died in the skirmish, an additional two Khmer troops and five Thais were injured. Thailand has denied the claim by Cambodia that ten soldiers were captured in the disputed territory. On the other side of the border, Cambodian officials have said the captives will be returned upon request.\nThe dispute over the contested territory flared up in June; UNESCO awarded the Hindu Preah Vihear Temple the status of World Heritage Site as a Cambodian property, bringing the issue back into the spotlight. The 900-year-old temple sits at the centre of a military build-up on both sides of the border and despite an agreed pull-back in August the situation deteriorated when Cambodia asserted that Thai troops had returned to the entrenched positions that now see around 1,000 soldiers from both sides facing each other. The return of Thai military forces saw the Cambodian Prime Minister, Hun Sen threaten to turn the area into a \"death zone\".\nUnited Nations Secretary General, Ban Ki-moon spoke yesterday on the incident, expressing grave concern over the escalation of the conflict and loss of life. A spokesperson for the Secretary-General said, \"He calls on both parties to exercise utmost restraint and urges them to expedite bilateral talks so that their differences can be resolved peacefully\". This is not the first time Ban Ki-moon has spoken on the issue; previously calls for restraint have been issued as the military build-up in the area has continued.\nThe ongoing dispute and yesterday's escalation have seen moves to take civilians out of harm's way. The government in Bangkok urged Thai citizens in Cambodia to leave the country if they were not there on urgent business. Over 400 returned on a Thai Airways flight following the call to evacuate Thai nationals. With a 2003 dispute and unrest having seen Thailand's embassy in Phnom Penh torched, Cambodian authorities deployed riot police around the building yesterday in case the dispute led to violence. In the disputed region, thousands of Cambodians have left due to the build-up of forces on both sides of the border and increased tensions.\nThe current flare-up along the border is the second incident this month; on October 3 there was a clash where Thailand claims Cambodian forces crossed the border and fired on Thai rangers causing two injuries. That incident saw both sides exchange protest letters. Thailand claimed that rangers patrolling on their side of the border encountered Cambodian troops and demanded they return across the border. The alleged response was apparently orders from superiors for the Cambodians to begin firing. The strongly-worded complaint stated, \"the above-mentioned intrusion of the Cambodian soldiers into Thailand's territory is a serious violation of Thailand's sovereignty and territorial integrity. Furthermore, the shooting by the Cambodian troops against the unarmed Thai para-military rangers is regarded as a brutal and aggressive act and is contrary to the spirit of friendly relations between Cambodia and Thailand.\""}

It was the biggest building on the exhibition grounds. Architect Bed\u0159ich M\u00fcnzberger used the glassed-in steel structures for the first time in the Czech lands. The building was 238 meters long and its main tower was 51 meters tall. It was used mainly for trade fairs and exhibitions, but also for concerts and other culture events.\nThe cause of the fire is under investigation, and could take a week to discover the cause. Press reports suggest the fire is connected to the October 9 murder of businessman V\u00e1clav Ko\u010dka junior, whose father is engaged in the Incheba company and has been leasing the exhibition grounds since 2001. V\u00e1clav Ko\u010dka senior is a friend of former Czech prime minister Ji\u0159\u00ed Paroubek. However, authorities mentioned an accident \u2013 explosion of pressure gas cylinder \u2013 was the probable cause. Incheba said they have video of the explosion recorded from the security cameras."}

According to court documents obtained by Wikinews, Chambers had decided to sue God, looking for a judge to issue a \"permanent injunction\" against the highest power.\nChambers said in his suit that God has spread fear across the globe causing \"widespread death, destruction and terrorization of millions upon millions of the Earth's inhabitants. [God also caused] fearsome floods, horrendous hurricanes, earthquakes, plagues, famine, genocidal wars, birth defects, terrifying tornadoes and the like\", and he wants the courts to order God \"to cease certain harmful activities and the making of terroristic threats.\"\nChambers is examining Polk's ruling and has not yet decided if he will file an appeal. Chambers says that \"God knows everything\", and therefore is well aware of the lawsuit that was filed against the higher power. Chambers also states that the court acknowledged his existence which \"is a recognition of God's omniscience.\"\n\"The court itself acknowledges the existence of God. Since God knows everything, God has notice of this lawsuit,\" said Chambers.\nIf Chambers decides to appeal the decision, he must do so within 30 days of the Judge's ruling.\nThe suit was an apparent retaliation for a 2007 ruling where the words 'rape' and 'victim' were banned from a criminal case involving a sexual assault incident. The woman who was assaulted, Tory Bowen, filed a lawsuit against Jeffrey Cheuvront, a district judge in the city of Lancaster when he banned the use of those words in her criminal case. Chambers says that her lawsuit is \"frivolous\" and he filed his suit to show people that \"anybody can sue anybody.\"\n\"This lawsuit having been filed and being of such questionable merit creates a circumstance where my lawsuit is appropriately filed. People might call it frivolous but if they read it they'll see there are very serious issues I have raised,\" stated Chambers in 2007."}

Nickel has been known to cause rashes on those who have a sensitivity to, or are allergic to the metal. Nickel is also mixed with other metals to make jewelry.\nThe Association says that the condition is likely to affect people who spend too much time talking on the phone. They found that those who spend too much time text messaging or talking for long periods on the phone, were most likely to develop a rash, sometimes severe, on their face and ears, or the tips of their fingers.\nTests in January, performed on 22 cellular phones by scientists at Brown University in Rhode Island located in the United States, had found that just under half, a total of 10, contained nickel while the rest had rubber buttons and a plastic case. Initially the rashes were unexplained, and researchers could not find a reason why so many individuals began to experience the symptoms. In most cases the rashes were untreatable. \n\"Cell phones intended for rugged use ... often have rubber coating and no surface nickel. Those with more fashionable designs often have metallic accents and are more likely to contain free nickel in their casings,\" said Lionel Bercovitch MD., one of the researchers, in a report in the journal for the Canadian Medical Association on January 1, 2008.\nResearchers also state that although some people may not be allergic to nickel, \"prolonged\" and continuous exposure to it can cause severe reactions.\n\"Prolonged or repetitive contact with a nickel-containing phone is more likely to cause a skin reaction in those who are allergic,\" said BAD dermatologist Dr. Graham Lowe in a press release. In the United Kingdom alone, BAD says nearly 30% of the population suffers from rashes brought on by prolonged exposure to the metal.\nThe researchers also recommend individuals to buy swab test kits to test for traces of nickel."}

The news comes as a joint result of the current financial crisis and high jet fuel prices, with Indian airlines in debt to the tune of Rs1,800 crore after surpassing their credit limits with oil companies, who are themselves making losses due to government controls on the price of jet fuel.\nKingfisher Red - originally known as Air Deccan, India's first budget carrier, until Kingfisher Airlines bought the company out - suffered the biggest drop in passenger numbers at 20% of their load factor. Flag carrier Air India is running at 53% of capacity after a 10% fall, and the average for airlines is now 55% as opposed to 65% this time last year.\nKingfisher Airlines has decided to enter an alliance with Jet Airlines that will see them collectively control half the Indian aviation market. Both airlines are in debt over fuel payments with Jet owing Rs850 crore while Kingfisher refused to disclose the amount they needed to pay. The money is owed mainly to the Indian Oil Corporation, with the rest owed to the Hindustan Petroleum Corporation and the Bharat Petroleum Corporation. 45% of costs for Indian carriers is fuel, which is 70% more expensive than abroad due to multiple taxes.\nAir India's head Raghu Menon expressed concern about what the Kingfisher-Jet alliance meant for his own airline. \"We were competing with both these airlines separately. Now we'll be competing with them perhaps as one entity. It'll be a challenge,\" he said.\nKingfisher have cancelled an order for three A340 aircraft from European airframer Airbus. Airbus executive John Leahy said that Airbus had discussed the issue with Kingfisher before the choice was made and that this was the only cancellation from India. He also maintains that India will be an important area for Airbus, with the firm predicting Indian aviation growth will be at 9.7% compared to a global rate of 5.4%. Airbus predict that 1,000 new aircraft will increase the Indian fleet fivefold by 2026.

Part of the advertisement contained a definition of the word \"exercise book\". The wording looked familiar, and \"Wikinews\" consulted \"Wikipedia\", the collaborative online encyclopedia.\nUpon seeing the \"Wikipedia\" definition, it appeared that the entry quoted in the promotional material was identical to the initial two paragraphs of the relevant \"Wikipedia\" entry.\nFreelance reporters for the Polish \"Wikinews\" decided to find out the reason for such a similarity and whether either of the texts (the advertisement's or Wikipedia's) might be a case of copyright violation. \nThe reporters contacted a Jaros\u0142aw Janas, Creative Director of \"4fun.tv.\", where the ad appeared. His reply included the following claim:\nCopyright on text does not last for fifty years as claimed by Janas, but for 70 years after the death of the author.\nTo investigate the authenticity of the above claims, \"Wikinews\" asked the main author of the two paragraphs in question, Wikipedian Julo, about the sources used to write the entry. He confirmed that he had written the text in question, and not copied it from an encyclopedic publication as claimed by Jana.\nIt is therefore impossible that both Julo and the people responsible for the exercise book advertisement have used the same uncopyrighted encyclopedia, thus coincidentally creating identical texts. The reporters also noted that the first draft of the introduction to the article was written by WaldemarWolskiHuta (February 2006). Afterward the text had undergone some modifications by Julo (September 2006), as well as Picus viridis and Beno (March 2008). However, the text presented in the press promotional material, which - according to 4fun.tv - came from an old-print encyclopedia is identical to the Wikipedia entry after the changes mentioned above had been made. Julo added that he was still alive, together with the other authors of the article in question who constituted the group of the copyright co-holders. This naturally led to a conclusion that neither 50 nor 70 years could have passed since their death. He left 4fun.tv's actions with a comment that although the contents he and the other Wikimedians had made public and free, they are far from making them available in any \"free style\", but under a specified license.\nIn follow up messages to Jaros\u0142aw Janas, Wikinews reporters confronted the creative director over his seemingly inaccurate claims. \nWikinews was told in a reply that 4fun.tv would ignore the claims unless they see permission from the author of the original content to investigate this story. They were also informed that further e-mails without any \"specifics\" sent by the reporter would be qualified as spam. 4fun.tv's creative director further added that he found the reporter's picture on the Internet and asked how the person would feel if this picture was to appear on billboards or press releases that advertised the TV station.\nWikipedia does allow copying of its content under certain conditions. The encyclopedia's content is released under the GNU Free Documentation License, which means that it can be copied, modified, and used commercially and non-commercially - under the conditions that the license's text is included with the copied content and the five main authors are mentioned. If a part of the article is used, like in the example quoted in this news story, a \"right to quote\", recognized by Polish law, may be used. In such a case it suffices to mention the source of the text (Polish Wikipedia) and the author of the excerpt. 4fun.tv met none of these conditions, meaning that copyright has been violated.\nOver a year ago Polish Wikinews reported on . Since that time such \"borrowings\" have become less frequent, however photos are still being used in discordance with the license. Journalists have gotten used to citing sources, e.g. Wikipedia, although licensing conditions require attributing the actual author, not the source. So instead of attributing John Doe for his contribution, agencies like Polska Agencja Prasowa (\"Polish Press Agency\") are attributing the source, Wikipedia.\nIn early September 2008 a similar situation occurred in relation to the Polish edition of Wiktionary. Gazeta Wyborcza, a Polish daily, published an IKEA advertisement, on the opening page of which an almost word-for-word Wiktionary entry was placed; additionally the advertisement used the characteristic MediaWiki layout. The reference to the external source used was missing.\nIn April 2008, an example of an Australian professor was cited; the scientist, in a reply to a news story, quoted a Wikipedia definition almost word-for-word. The same professor condemned the use of Wikipedia in his previous press appearances.\nIn 2005 Wikipedia material was discovered in the German weekly magazine Der Spiegel, which acknowledged its fault and published appropriate apologies in place of the article in the online edition.\n\"Frontline\" magazine in 2007 was found using an image from Wikipedia without proper credit. When pointed out the magazine acknowledged the failing and a correction was promptly given in the subsequent issue."}

It is hoped that IBEX studies may reveal the cause of these indentations. \nRecent observations indicate the solar wind pressure has weakened by 25 percent over the past decade and is presently at its weakest level in 50 years. Ibex studies could help confirm whether and why the heliosphere is shrinking. Scientists postulate that if the heliosphere continues to weaken, the amount of cosmic radiation reaching the inner parts of our solar system, including earth will increase. This could trigger growing levels of disruption to electrical equipment, damage satellites and possibly harm life on earth.\n\"Around 90 per cent of the galactic cosmic radiation is deflected by our heliosphere, so the boundary protects us from this harsh galactic environment,\" said Nathan Schwadron, co-investigator on the IBEX mission at Boston University. \"IBEX gives us a chance to look at how our Solar System's bubble fits in as a tiny piece of the entire Galaxy,\" claimed David McComas of the Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio, Texas, and IBEX's principal investigator."}

On October 17, the President of the Church of Scientology in New York City, John Carmichael, also accused \"Anonymous\" of being behind the shooting. \nOne month ago, an article on CNN's citizen journalism wing, \"iReport\", also accused Anonymous of being behind the shooting, and several other alleged terrorist plots. The article also went on to accuse \"Anonymous\" of being behind the suicide of 14-year-old Megan Meier who killed herself after being 'cyber-bullied'.

The Thai Supreme Court found him guilty of corruption in a 5-4 ruling by the Criminal Division for Holders of Political Positions section of the court and issued the sentence over a land deal. The court acquitted his wife who was the purchaser of the land. The contentious package of land was taken over by Thailand's Financial Institutions Development Fund (FIDF) in 1995, following the collapse of the Erawan Trust in an effort to counter the trust's losses.\nIn reading the court's verdict, one judge stated, \"Thaksin violated the article of the constitution on conflict of interest, as he was then prime minister and head of government, and was supposed to work for the benefit of the public, ... He is sentenced to two years in jail.\"\nDespite his wife, Potjaman Shinawatra, having escaped sentencing in the Ratchadaphisek land deal case, she still faces jail time on return to Thailand. During July she was convicted of tax evasion and a warrant is outstanding for her to face three years in jail for that conviction. The Ratchadaphisek case centred around approximately thirteen acres of land in central Bangkok that was sold to her in 2003 for a knock-down price of 772 million baht (US$ 22.5 million).\nWith the law in Thailand barring ministers and their partners from doing business with government agencies, groups who protested for the removal of Thaksin are pleased with the result. People's Alliance for Democracy (PAD) supporters were reportedly shouting, \"We've won!\" at the announcement of the verdict. They had watched a live telecast of the court's ruling, hailing activist Veera Somkwamkid who filed the case as a hero.\nSomchai Wongsawat, the country's current Prime Minister and Thaksin's brother-in-law, has given assurances that the current government will not interfere in the court's ruling. In speaking to journalists after the ruling was handed down he stressed that the case only covered violation of the National Counter Commission Act barring government officials from involvement where they may have oversight. This was seen as the reason for Thaksin's wife, Potjaman escaping prosecution in this case.\nThe case's chief prosecutor has called on Britain to speedily extradite ex-PM Thaksin so he may begin his jail term. A number of other warrants for his arrest remain outstanding from additional cases brought over his time in office."}

The extensively revised version covers over five thousand topics, targeting the eight to seventeen years age group. Partnerships with the Shuttleworth Foundation and the Hole in the Wall project will see it distributed in South Africa and India as well as copies being available globally via the offices of SOS Children UK's umbrella organisation, SOS Kinderdorf worldwide.\nFirst launched in 2006 as a 4,000 article edition, the extract of \"Wikipedia\" has employed hi-tech distribution methods, as well as offering a website version which has steadily climbed up in ranking to above other reviewed \"Wikipedia\" rivals and copies; the 2007 version was available on the BitTorrent peer to peer network to keep distribution costs down and was equivalent to a fifteen-volume printed encyclopedia. Monday's release is compared to a twenty-volume print edition.\nKey to the process for selecting articles is the English National Curriculum and similar educational standards around the world. The initial vision was to bring this wealth of knowledge to schools where access to the Internet was poor or unavailable, but copies of \"Wikipedia for Schools\" can be found on many first world school intranets and web servers. Among the compelling reasons to adopt the project are the vetting and additional study materials which overcome the oft-publicised concerns many educators have with the million article plus \"Wikipedia\" that anyone can edit.\nIn today's press release announcing the launch, Wikimedia Foundation Executive Director Sue Gardner expressed delight at seeing the project bring out a new version, \"Our goal is to make Wikipedia accessible to as many people as possible around the world, and SOS Children is a great partner that helps us make that happen. Wikipedia is released under a free content license so that individuals and institutions can easily adapt, reuse and customize its content: we encourage others, like SOS Children, to do exactly that.\"\nRunning 192 schools in the developing world, SOS Children sees \"Wikipedia for Schools\" as a key piece in fulfilling the educational aspect of their mission. SOS Children's Chairwoman, Mary Cockcroft gave us an introduction and, a \"Wikipedia\" administrator himself, the charity's CEO Andrew Cates spoke to \"Wikinews\" at length about the project.\n You are part of SOS-Kinderdorf International, can you explain a little about how this works in terms of distributing funds raised in the UK and involving UK citizens in work outside the country?\nMary Cockcroft: SOS Children['s Villages] is a \"club\" of member charities in 130 countries helping orphans and vulnerable children. The club elects SOS-Kinderdorf International as secretary. SOS is a large organisation whose members in aggregate turned over $1bn in 2007, and whose projects include owning and running 192 schools and family-based care for 70,000 children. However much of these funds are raised locally, with for example the member charities in each of India, Pakistan and South Africa raise considerably more funds in their own country than SOS UK does from the UK. Nonetheless SOS Children UK principally raises funds to finance projects in the developing world, and has only financially small projects in the UK (such as the Schools Wikipedia, which is very low cost because of extensive use of volunteers). This year we expect about 80% of our UK income will leave the UK for overseas SOS associations, and some of the remaining 20% will pay for project oversight. We do not spend money in the UK on Direct Mail or TV advertising. Our UK office is involved in overseeing projects we finance and a small number of high-skilled volunteers from the UK help overseas. However around 98% of SOS staff worldwide are local nationals, as are most volunteers.\n How much work does the UK charity actually carry out within the home country? Are there failings within the government system for orphans and other needy children that you feel obliged to remedy?\nMC: We are deeply unhappy about the situation of children in out-of-home care in the UK. However our care model of 168 hour-a-week resident mothers does not fit with the UK philosophy for children without parental care. Internationally SOS always has a policy of sharing best practice and we are working to improve understanding of our way of working, which appears to us to have far better outcomes than the existing one in the UK. Ultimately though the legal responsibility for these children lies with government and we cannot remedy anything without their invitation.\n Who first came up with the idea of doing a vetted Wikipedia extract? What was the impetus? Was it more for the developing world than first world?\nAndrew Cates: I honestly cannot remember who first suggested it, but it came from somewhere in the Wikipedia community rather than from the charity. The original product was very much pitched at the developing world where the Internet is only available if at all over an expensive phone line. I worked in West Africa 1993-1996 and I know well at how thirsty for knowledge people are and how ingenious they will be in overcoming technical obstacles if the need for infrastructure is removed.\n In reading past year's announcements there's some pride in the project being picked up and used in the first world, was this expected or a pleasant surprise?\nAC: It was a pleasant surprise. I don't think we had realised what the barriers schools faced in using the main Wikipedia were. It isn't just pupils posting material about teachers or meeting strangers: the \"Random Article\" button on every page could potentially deliver an article on hardcore porn. We had already started when discussion broke on banning Wikipedia from classrooms and I am sure we benefited from it.\n Can you give an outline of the selection and vetting process? Is it primarily Wikipedians working on this, or are people from the educational establishment brought in?\nAC: It was a long and painful process, even with a really good database system. Articles were taken into the proposal funnel from three main sources: direct proposals for inclusion from Wikipedians, lists which came from the Release Version team and proposals drawn up from working through National Curriculum subjects by SOS volunteers. In a few cases where we felt articles were missing we asked the community to write them (e.g. Portal:Early Modern Britain, which is a curriculum subject, was kindly written just for us): These \"proposals\" \nwere then looked at by mainly SOS volunteers (some onwiki, some offline). Our offices are in the middle of Cambridge and we get high quality volunteers, who skim read each article and then compared two versions from the article history by credible WP editors a significant period apart (this picks up most graffiti vandalism which runs at about 3% of articles). Once they had identified a \"best\" version they marked any sections or text strings for deletion (sections which were just a list of links to other articles not included, empty sections, sex scandals etc). A substantial sample of each volunteers work was then doubled checked for quality by one of two office staff (of whom I was one). We then have a script which does some automated removals and clean ups. Once we had a selection we posted it to relevant wikiprojects and a few \"experts\" and got any extra steers.\n Will you be making use of BitTorrent for distribution again this year? Was it a success in 2007?\nAC: BitTorrent was a bit disappointing in that it got us the only substantial criticisms we received online. A lot of people find it too much effort to use. However for the period we offered a straight http: download we had huge problems with spiders eating vast bandwidth (the file is 3.5G: a few thousand rogue spider downloads and it starts to hurt). As per last year therefore our main two channels will be free download by BitTorrent and mailing the DVDs free all over the world. At a pinch we will (as before) put straight copies up for individuals who cannot get it any other way, and we have some copies on memory sticks for on distributors.\n Is it your opinion that the UK Government should be encouraging the adoption of projects like this as mainstream educational resources?\nAC: Clearly yes. We have had a very enthusiastic reaction from schools and the teaching community. We think every school should have an intranet copy. We expect the Government to catch on in a few years. That is not to say that Wikipedia is as good as resources developed by teachers for teachers such as lesson plans etc. but it is a fantastic resource.\n You're a Wikipedia administrator, all too often a thankless task. What prompted you to get involved in the first place? What are the most notable highs and lows of your involvement with the project?\nAC: Funnily the thing I have found most amazing about Wikipedia is not widely discussed, which is the effect of Wikipedia policies on new editors. I have seen countless extreme POV new editors, who come in and try to get their opinions included slowly learn not only that there are other opinions to consider but that elements of their own opinion which are not well founded. Watching someone arrive often (on pages on religions for example) full of condemnation for others, gradually become understanding and diplomatic is one of the biggest buzzes there is. The downside though is where correcting things which are wrong is too painfully slow because you need to find sources. I was a post-doc at Cambridge University in combustion and I know the article on Bunsen burners has several really significant errors concerning the flame structure and flow structure. But sadly I cannot correct it because I am still looking around for a reliable source.\n Do you believe schools should encourage students to get involved contributing to the editable version of Wikipedia? Does SOS Children encourage those who are multilingual to work on non-English versions?\nAC: I think older students have a lot to learn from becoming involved in editing Wikipedia.\n To close, is there anything you'd like to add to encourage use of \"Wikipedia for Schools\", or to persuade educators to gain a better understanding of \"Wikipedia\"?\nAC: I would encourage people to feed back to the project online or via the charity. The Wikipedia community set out to help educate the world and are broadly incredibly well motivated to help. As soon as we understand what can be done to improve things people are already on the task.\n Thank you for your time."}

Hartmann, an officer in the United States Air Force Reserve, is the subject of two new investigations. Both center on whether Hartmann abused his power as the Legal Adviser to the Convening Authority in the Department of Defense Office of Military Commissions. He no longer holds this position.\nThe United States Air Force is conducting an ethics probe after a preliminary investigation concluded that there were sufficient grounds to move forward. The inquiry is investigating allegations that cases which were not ready for trial moved ahead because Hartmann bullied prosecutors and logistics officials.\nThe other investigation is being conducted by the United States Department of Defense which is looking into complaints by at least two military officials that Hartmann acted in an abusive and retaliatory manner towards them while they served at the Office of Military Commissions.\nThese probes will \"cast doubt on all of the decisions that have been taken under his tenure,\" predicted Hina Shamsi, who serves as official trial observer at Guantanamo for the American Civil Liberties Union.\nHartmann was recalled to active duty in July 2007 and appointed the Legal Advisor to the civilian official \u2014 known as the Convening Authority \u2014 in charge of Office of Military Commissions. The position of Convening Authority has been filled by Susan J. Crawford since February 2007. Hartmann's active duty term was to be for a two year term.\nThe duties of the Legal Advisor to Convening Authority included providing general oversight of the Prosecution and Defense teams, and providing advice to the convening authority when appeals are made. \nWhen Hartmann was appointed the Chief Prosecutor, Colonel Morris Davis was on medical leave. Hartmann was dissatisfied with the process of the commissions. In the nine months since the passage of the Military Commissions Act of 2006 only three captives had been charged. Hartmann is reported to have intervened in the operation of the Prosecution, pressuring Prosecutors to initiate charges against the captives suspected of being the more senior members of al-Qaeda.\nWhen Davis returned from his medical leave, he and Hartmann clashed. Davis felt Hartmann had improperly over-stepped his assigned duties, usurping his own role.\nDavis reported that his approach had been to charge captives whose trials could be conducted without access to secret evidence, and without access to evidence coerced through the use of torture or questionable interrogation techniques. \nIn October 2007, Davis went public and suggested that both he and Hartmann resign from the Office of Military Commissions. A military inquiry at the time censured Davis, who did resign from the Office of Military Commissions, and has subsequently testified against Hartmann.\nThe Presiding Officers of three of the Military Commissions heard testimony from Hartmann and eventually barred him from participation in the cases before them, because they believed he had exercised \"illegal command influence\".\nStephen R. Henley \u2014 the Presiding Officer of Mohammed Jawad's commission, who barred Hartmann from further participation \u2014 wrote on August 14, 2008:\nAfter Colonel Patrick Parrish barred Hartmann from participation in Omar Khadr's commission, Hartmann's subordinate was promoted to replace him. Hartmann was moved to a new position, where he served over the Prosecution. Pentagon officials described it as a lateral move. Air Force officials described it as a promotion.\nOn November 2, 2008 Carol Rosenberg, writing in the \"Miami Herald\", reported that Hartmann had filed a request to retire from the Air Force on 17 February 2008. Hartmann's superior at the Pentagon, William J. Haynes, had announced his resignation in February. "}

Online communities and web forums sharing application cracks, exotic exploits and virus code make it easy for teens to do the illegal activities.

He began the Beverly Hills Playhouse in 1978 and taught acting classes there to noted actors including George Clooney and Gene Hackman. Katselas is survived by a sister and two brothers.\nKatselas directed an off-Broadway production of Edward Albee's \"The Zoo Story\", and received a Tony Award nomination for his 1969 direction of \"Butterflies are Free\". Actress Blythe Danner won a Tony Award for her role in \"Butterflies are Free\" under Katselas' direction. He moved to California to direct the film version of that play, and went on to direct films and television movies. Actress Eileen Heckart received an Academy Award for her role in the film version of \"Butterflies are Free\".\nKatselas directed the San Francisco and Los Angeles productions of the play \"P.S. Your Cat Is Dead!\" by playwright James Kirkwood, Jr. In his author's notes in the publication of the script, Kirkwood acknowledged Katselas, and wrote that the plays were \"directed with incredible energy and enthusiasm by Milton Katselas, to whom I am extremely indebted\".\nKatselas directed the television movie \"Strangers: Story of a Mother and Daughter\", and actress Bette Davis received an Emmy Award for her role in the movie. Katselas taught many famous actors including Michelle Pfeiffer, Richard Gere, Robert Duvall, Jack Lemmon, Al Pacino, Goldie Hawn, Christopher Walken, Burt Reynolds, George C. Scott, Elizabeth Taylor, Richard Burton, Alec Baldwin, and Patrick Swayze. Katselas was credited with being able to nurture actors with raw talent so that they could develop strong Hollywood careers. He utilized innovative techniques in his courses - one course called \"Terrorist Theatre\" had a simple premise: successfully get an acting role within six weeks or leave the course.\nHe grew up in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania to parents who had immigrated from Greece, and graduated from Carnegie Mellon. He studied acting with Lee Strasberg in New York at the Actors Studio, and received advice from directors Joshua Logan and Elia Kazan.\nKatselas was a prominent Scientologist, and a July 2007 profile on Katselas in \"The New York Times Magazine\" observed that some of his students stopped taking courses at the Beverly Hills Playhouse because they felt they had been pressured to join the Church of Scientology. According to the article, Katselas credited Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard \"for much of his success in life\", and one of his students works at Scientology's Celebrity Centre. The article commented that some in Los Angeles view the Beverly Hills Playhouse as \"a recruitment center for Scientology\".\nKatselas met L. Ron Hubbard after moving to California, and began studying Scientology in 1965. \"The New York Times Magazine\" reported that he had reached the level of \"Operating Thetan, Level 5, or O.T. V.\" in 2007. According to \"The New York Times Magazine\" when Scientologists proceed up the \"The Bridge to Total Freedom\" they learn the story of Xenu, and that: \"75 million years ago the evil alien Xenu solved galactic overpopulation by dumping 13.5 trillion beings in volcanoes on Earth, where they were vaporized, scattering their souls.\" A Church of Scientology publication, \"Source\", lists Katselas as reaching O.T. V. in 1989.\nThough some actors felt pressured to join the Church of Scientology after taking courses at the Beverly Hills Playhouse, at least one individual felt Katselas was not active enough with the organization. Actress Jenna Elfman left the Beverly Hills Playhouse because she felt Katselas was not committed enough to Scientology. Katselas had previously directed Elfman in half of \"Visions and Lovers: Variations on a Theme\", two one-act plays about relationships that he had written himself. In 1999 Katselas had planned to adapt the script of \"Visions and Lovers\" to a film version, and Elfman was set to reprise her role from the play. In an article in \"Variety\" about the project, Elfman commented on her experience working with Katselas: \"He is brilliant, and knows me so well as a person and an actress that he gets the most out of me.\"\nOther prominent Scientologist actors who have studied under Katselas include Giovanni Ribisi, Jason Lee, and Leah Remini. According to \"Rolling Stone\", Katselas also recruited actress Kelly Preston to Scientology. Actress Nancy Cartwright (the voice of Bart Simpson), told Scientology publication \"Celebrity\" that Katselas motivated her to get more active in Scientology, and she stated she took the organization's \"Purification Rundown\" and her life \"took off completely\".\nAnne Archer was introduced to Scientology while studying at the Beverly Hills Playhouse, as was former Scientologist and now outspoken critic actor Jason Beghe. Beghe told Roger Friedman of \"FOX News\" in April 2008 that \"He [Katselas] gets kickbacks\", and that he was brought to a Scientology center by fellow Beverly Hills Playhouse classmate Bodhi Elfman, Jenna Elfman's husband. In a 1998 article for \"Buzz Magazine\", Randye Hoder wrote \"In his class, Katselas is careful not to label anything as a tenet of Scientology, but there is no question that the church's influence seeps into the playhouse.\"\nAnne Archer's husband and fellow Scientologist, producer Terry Jastrow, commented to \"The New York Times Magazine\" that Katselas changed the way he experiences life on a day-to-day basis: \"I go out in the world and look at human behavior now. I see a woman or man interacting with a saleslady, and I see the artistry in it. Life is an endless unspooling of art, of acting, of painting, of architecture. And where did I learn that? From Milton.\" \nActor Anthony Head of \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\" spoke highly of Katselas in a 2002 interview with \"San Francisco Chronicle\": \"He's this wonderfully intuitive teacher and his premise is basically: The only real barriers are the ones we put in front of ourselves. If you say, 'My character wouldn't do that' -- bollocks! Ultimately it's you who wouldn't say that. Who knows what your character might do.\" In the acknowledgements of her 2004 autobiography \"Are You Hungry, Dear?: Life, Laughs, and Lasagna\", actress Doris Roberts wrote: \"I thank my friend and acting teacher, the incredible Milton Katselas, for his insights, wisdom, and inspiration, which have helped make me the actress that I am.\"\nKatselas authored two books: \"Dreams Into Action: Getting What You Want\", first published in 1996 by Dove Books, and \"Acting Class: Take a Seat\", which came out earlier this month. \"Dreams Into Action\", a \"New York Times\" Bestseller, sought to modify motivational acting exercises to the field of business. \nIn an interview in the 2007 book \"Acting Teachers of America\", Katselas commented on his experiences as an acting teacher over the years: \"I have very special teachers here at the Beverly Hills Playhouse\u2014some have been with me for over twenty-five years. I believe that to make a difference over the long haul, we need to train teachers. I really care about the craft of acting.

It was found that the ice thickness had been fairly constant for the five previous winters. The researchers were able to highlight widespread ice thinning in areas covered by both old and young ice. This thinning constitutes the most severe since records started being taken in the early 1990s.\nThe study by scientists of University College London has been published in the journal \"Geophysical Research Letters\". The work provides the first definitive proof for overall decrease in Arctic ice volume, claim the authors.\nThe researchers have found that last winter's ice thickness represented a decrease of an average of 26 centimeters below the 2002-2008 winter average. The greatest decline of 49 centimeters was in the western Arctic, which could explain the region's becoming relatively ice-free this summer, allowing it to be open to shipping for the first time in 30 years. The record low of ice thickness during summer happened when the weather was not abnormally warm.\nKatharine Giles, the lead author, points out that the study used satellite data sets, which had a number of advantages over other methods. Previous studies have used measurements from drilling, or submarine and airborne surveys. These studies could be severely limited by time and space. The present study utilized continuous, all-weather, day-and-night radar altimeter data from the European Space Agency's Envisat satellite. The study measured ice thickness from October to March, 2007, over more than half of the Arctic.\nThere has been considerable uncertainty over the causes of ice loss in the Arctic. It has been debated that ice could have been piled up against the coast, thus reducing the sea ice extent. Measurements of the ice thickness, as in the present study, give definite proof for ice melting. \"So this means melting; it doesn't mean that the ice has just been pushed up against the coastline,\" remark Seymour Laxon, co-author of the paper.\nThe conclusions of the study can help predict what could happen with the ice cover in future. Deflection of sunlight by the Arctic ice cap could be reduced, leading to larger areas of water, which can absorb heat. Warmer temperatures will in turn promote more ice melting. \"About five years ago, the average projection for the sea ice disappearing was about 2080\", said Dr Laxon. \"But the ice minimums, and this evidence of melting, suggests that we should favor the models that suggest the sea ice will disappear by 2030-2040, but there is still a lot of uncertainty.\" "}

The present find points to more widespread occurrence of the minerals in comparatively younger strata of Mars. The find indicates that liquid water might have been present on the surface of Mars for a longer time than previously thought. The previous view was that liquid water disappeared from the Martian surface three billion years ago. Now it is estimated that water could have been present as late as two billion years ago.\nThe presence of opal not only indicates water, but also that it was there long enough to alter some of the rocks.

The blasts went off shortly before noon IST (UTC+5:30) at market places and government buildings in the state capital Guwahati and surrounding area.\nReports say that so far 77 people have been confirmed killed and between 200 and 300 injured. 41 of the victims were in Guwahati, 21 in Kokrajhar and 15 in Barpeta.\nAssam has been the scene of separatist insurgencies for years, most notably by United Liberation Front of Assam (ULFA) which was outlawed by the Indian government in 1990. The Associated Press says over 10,000 people have died in separatist violence in the past decade.\nThe ULFA has denied any involvement, reported the Press Trust of India. Instead, a previously unheard of group, calling itself Islamic Security Force-Indian Mujahideen (ISF-IM) claimed responsibility in a text message to a television station. The message included a warning of future attacks.\nLater, people who were apparently upset about the bombings, started rioting in the streets of Guwahati and throwing stones at vehicles. They also torched at least two fire engines. Police shut down roads and implemented a curfew in response to the unrest.\nShakeel Ahmad of the Ministry of Home Affairs said conditions in Assam were \"very volatile, the government was on high alert and, even then, this has happened.\"\nIn the past, the government has blamed similar attacks on Islamic militants based in nearby Bangladesh.\nBan Ki-moon, the secretary-general of the United Nations condemned the attack in a statement.\nBan conveyed \"sorrow and sympathy to the Government and people of India for the loss of life and destruction caused by today's series of bombings,\" in the statement which was released on Thursday."}

The announcement came as part of Tennant's speech accepting the outstanding drama performance award at the program. \nTennant, 37, is currently portraying the lead in a production of \"Hamlet\" with the Royal Shakespeare Company, and accepted the award by videolink. He was up against \"Doctor Who\" co-star Catherine Tate, who portrayed his companion Donna Noble. \"Doctor Who\" was recognized with the award for most popular drama program. \n\"I love this part, and I love this show so much that if I don't take a deep breath and move on now I never will, and you'll be wheeling me out of the Tardis in my bath chair,\" said Tennant in his address to the audience in attendance at the Royal Albert Hall. \"TARDIS\" refers to the time machine and spacecraft operated by Tennant's character known only as \"the Doctor\", and stands for Time And Relative Dimension In Space.\nTennant will again inhabit the TARDIS as the Tenth Doctor for the upcoming \"Doctor Who\" Christmas special, \"The Next Doctor\", and will portray the Doctor in four additional specials set to air in 2009. A new actor will play the Doctor for the program's 2010 series.\nTennant had initially been interested in portraying the Doctor in the 2005 series, but that role went to Christopher Eccleston. The series had previously been dormant since 1996, with Paul McGann in the lead role. Tennant has said that it was his childhood dream to play the Doctor. This is not his first time being recognized at the National Television Awards for his role as the Doctor. In 2006 he received the award for most popular actor, and again in 2007. In 2006 Tennant beat out actor Tom Baker as the favorite doctor, in a survey of readers of \"Doctor Who Magazine\".\nThe Doctor comes from a race of Timelords, and has the ability to \"regenerate\" and change appearance when his health is failing. Actors including Russell Tovey, James Nesbitt, Paterson Joseph, John Simm and David Morrissey have been mentioned in the media as possibilities to portray the 11th incarnation of the Doctor.\nRussell T. Davies, the program's current executive producer, commented to \"BBC News\" on the end of the Tenth Doctor and his work with Tennant: \"I've been lucky and honoured to work with David over the past few years - and it's not over yet, the Tenth Doctor still has five spectacular hours left! After which, I might drop an anvil on his head. Or maybe a piano. A radioactive piano. But we're planning the most enormous and spectacular ending, so keep watching.\" Steven Moffat will replace Davies as executive director of \"Doctor Who\" in 2010.\nTennant began his work as an actor with roles in theatre, and progressed to starring roles on television programs including \"Blackpool\" and \"Casanova\". He has recently returned to theatre roles with the Royal Shakespeare Company, and has received praise for his work in \"Hamlet\" and \"Love's Labour's Lost\"."}

We've got to work together.\"\nClinton \u2014 whose wife Hillary Clinton ran against Obama for the Democratic nomination earlier this year \u2014 has been accused in the past of not fully supporting Obama's presidency. He showed no lack of support for both Obama and Franken with whom he shared the stage. Franken is running against incumbent Republican Norm Coleman and independent candidate Dean Barkley.\nAccording to Clinton, the Minnesota race is crucial. If Franken is elected, Clinton says he will be one more senator to help Obama run the country without major Republican opposition in the Senate. With 60 Democrats in the Senate, Democrats will be able to push legislation through without filibusters by GOP members, which can cause a bill to delay in passing or fail all together.\n\"[Obama] has a chance to rewrite the 21st century,\" Clinton said, according to the \"Star Tribune\", referring to the presidency of George W. Bush. \"Let's go back and do it right this time. In order to do that, he's going to have to get some votes. ...\" in Congress.\nThe Minnesota race is close. According to the \"St. Paul Pioneer Press\", Sen. Coleman leads Franken 37.3 percent to 35.8 percent in an average of recent polls. 16 percent supported Barkley.\nBefore introducing Clinton, Franken thanked him for the support of him and his wife.\n\"I am privileged to say the Clintons are my friends,\" Franken said, according to the Star Tribune. \"But more important, they are friends of the middle class, of working men and women in this state and this country I'm running to represent.\"\nA Minnesota Public Radio News/University of Minnesota Humphrey Institute poll conducted this week found that 52 percent of likely voters supported Obama, while 41 percent supported GOP candidate John McCain. Clinton \u2014 who carried the state by a landslide in 1996 \u2014 did not hesitate to ask for more votes, telling the crowd: \"I want you to do better than that for Barack Obama.\"\nClinton was the final speaker in a long list of Minnesota Democrats, including: former U.S. Vice President Walter Mondale, the mayors of Minneapolis and Saint Paul, R. T. Rybak and Chris Coleman, U.S. Senator Amy Klobuchar, U.S. Rep. Keith Ellison, Speaker of the Minnesota House of Representatives Margaret Anderson Kelliher. Mayor Coleman is not related to Senator Coleman, who also served as mayor of Saint Paul.\nAll of the speakers touched on continuing to work toward electing Obama, Franken and other Democrats to Minnesota seats in congress. Even with the 11-point lead Obama holds in the MPR poll, Obama campaign staff circulated the hall at the beginning on the rally and at the end asking attendees to volunteer their time going door-to-door and making phone calls to registered Democrats.\n\"Barack Obama is going to be the next president of the United States,\" Mayor Coleman said, according to the Associated Press. \"But we've got to work to make it happen.\""}

As a result, it is impossible for most Sprint and Cogent customers to communicate directly between each other across the Internet. The actual reasons for the dispute are unknown, though Cogent has had similar disputes in the past with Level3, Telia, Limelight, France Telecom, and AOL.\nThe two ISPs are currently in litigation over peering, the free exchange of traffic between the ISPs for little or no cost. In shutting down the peering, according to Cogent, Sprint is in violation of a contractual obligation to exchange Internet traffic. However, according to Sprint, Cogent has failed to meet its criteria for the peering agreement, and should be required to pay for the traffic, which Cogent refused to do.\nThe de-peering has resulted in some customers of both companies experiencing dropped connections. However, most consumer ISPs and college networks are \"multihomed\", and thus could connect through separate lines to both companies."}

Another 2,000 officers are on standby in case of trouble following the rally. The event's highlight is expected to be a telephone address by ousted and now-fugitive ex-Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra.\nDressed in red shirts, busloads of supporters of the former premier have been arriving in Bangkok all day. The rally has started several hours ahead of schedule and so far the \"Truth Today\" event has been peaceful and good-natured. It is expected that the rally will be broadcast as a political talk show during prime time, the event is billed as being pro-democracy and a counter to the ongoing protests by the People's Alliance for Democracy (PAD) who seek to have the current government removed due to claims of influence by Thaksin. The country's current Prime Minister, Somchai Wongsawat is Thaksin's brother-in-law and stands accused of being a proxy for the now-outlawed Thai Rak Thai party.\nAccording to the event's organiser, Jatuporn Prompan, an MP with the People Power Party, Thaksin will speak at 8pm local time and, \"is free to speak out and will not be restricted by topics and time constraints\". Concern that the speech may exacerbate the country's current political crisis has led to army chief, General Anupong Paochinda, ordering that the event be closely monitored. Thailand's military have previously given assurances that there will not be a repeat of the bloodless 2006 coup which deposed Thaksin and his populist government.\nThai authorities are currently drawing up extradition paperwork for Thaksin following him being found guilty by a division of the Supreme Court of abuse of his powers over a land deal where his wife bought prime real estate in Bangkok. The court is expected to review Thaksin's broadcast message; should the content of his message to supporters be found as contempt of court an additional seven year jail term could be added to the two year sentence already handed down.\nEarlier in the week anti-government protesters picketed the British embassy in Bangkok calling for Thaksin's extradition. It is expected he would fight this and has already claimed he cannot get a fair trial in Thailand. He alleges the country's judiciary is sympathetic to the opposition.\nTensions continue to increase in the months-long dispute. Thursday saw two attacks on anti-government parties take place. Security staff for the PAD protest outside Government House were attacked with a grenade and another explosive device was thrown into the garden of a senior member of the judiciary. According to Thai police the attack on PAD supporters injured ten.\nArmed forces reinforcements are on standby for the end of today's \"Truth Today\" rally. With the national stadium able to hold 100,000 there is concern over what will happen when the event ends at 10pm. Bangkok police commander, Suchart Muankaew expressed concern saying, \"anything could happen\"."}

General Tamogami, age 60, lost his post after his essay for a contest was made public on that day to show his views contradicting the government's official standpoint, as to Japan's deeds during a period of its imperialistic past. Tamogami, a graduate of the National Defense Academy, joined ASDF in 1971, and became Chief of Staff in March 2007.\nThe essay includes a claim that it is a false accusation to describe Japan as the aggressor in connection with the war in China and World War II. Tamogami also challenges the ban on Japan's exercise of collective self-defense and the restrictions on use of weapons by Self-Defense Forces (SDF).\nDefense Minister Yasukazu Hamada soon decided to dismiss Tamogami from the post, deeming that the opinion expressed in Tamogami's essay was inconsistent with the government's position, and that it should not have been publicly expressed by an officer of his rank. The government's official standpoint is reflected in the Murayama Statement of 1995, which was delivered by then Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama on the 50th anniversary of the war's end. It states that Japan advanced along the road to war \"to ensnare the Japanese people in a fateful crisis,\" and \"through its colonial rule and aggression, caused tremendous damage and suffering to the people of many countries\"; these are described as \"irrefutable facts of history.\" The Murayama Statement has been upheld by succeeding Prime Ministers.\nReportedly Tamogami in the essay justifies Japan's deeds during the period, describing Japan as a \"victim\" that was drawn into the Sino-Japanese War by Chiang Kai-shek, who led Kuomintang party at that time. He blames the United States for a \"trap\" that forced Japan into starting the war between the two countries. He also says \"we need to realize that many Asian countries take a positive view of the Greater East Asia War,\" claiming that the local people in the Korean Peninsula and the former Manchuria were liberated from oppression and their standard of living markedly improved, under Japan's colonial rule.\nTamogami apparently skipped a procedure, which is provided by a Ministry's internal rule, of obtaining pre-publication permission for an essay by an SDF member. Tamogami submitted this essay with a title meaning \"Was Japan an aggressor nation?\" for an essay contest hosted by a Tokyo-based company, and won the top prize."}

If they were businesses in the marketplace, they would be indicted for violation of the antitrust laws.\"\nBaldwin voiced his concerns about the growth of the federal government as well as the troubled global economy. He said that the \"two major parties will do nothing to thwart or diminish what is currently happening...I believe with all my heart that our sovereignty and our national independence are hanging by a very precarious thread.\"\nBarr stated his opinion that both McCain and Obama are indistinguishable on policy positions and accused them of \"sound-bite politics\" as well as showing \"no leadership whatsoever.\" He also found it odd that the Department of Justice was absent during this autumn's financial crisis. \"There have been no prosecutions, not even apparently a significant investigation of what appears to be historic fraud,\" he said. \nAt this time, it is unknown how many tuned in to see the debate when it was broadcast nationally on C-SPAN both Friday and Saturday. As of Sunday, any other media coverage has been minimal, a far cry from last week's debate between Nader and Baldwin in Washington, DC. "}

The newspaper employs 95 correspondents and 8 foreign bureaus and has won 7 Pulitzer Prizes, making it the most prominent newspaper to transition to online publication. It is due to celebrate its one hundredth anniversary later this month. The move has other major newspapers wondering whether this is the future of mainstream journalism.\nEditor John Yemma stated \"It is the future for many papers, but because we are not-for-profit we are not exactly a model for for-profit publications.\" The \"Monitor\" receives its funding from the Christian Science Church, but is nonsectarian and does not proselytize, and the Church has no say in its editorial policy. The newspaper was founded in 1908 by Christian Science founder Mary Baker Eddy as a reaction against partisan journalism.\nThe new publication format will be a website updated daily, with subscribers receiving e-mail briefs of major stories and a 44 page weekly magazine. According to a report in \"The Independent\", the weekly magazine \"will carry separate original content.\" The \"Monitor\" has made this announcement as a response to rising print publication costs and falling subscriptions. The actual changeover from a Monday through Friday publication five days a week to a single weekly magazine will occur in April 2009. \nYemma predicts that within the next five years, economic constraints will force most other newspapers to make similar changes. A small number of local newspapers made similar changes before the \"Monitor\" announced its plans. Two examples are \"The Capital Times\" and \"The Daily Telegram\" respectively of Madison, Wisconsin and Superior, Wisconsin.\nKen Doctor of Outsell Inc. assessed the economic situation for \"The New York Times\". 92 percent of a typical newspaper's revenue comes from its print edition, so the cost of ceasing print publication exceeds the benefit in savings for most newspapers. The \"Monitor\" has an unusual funding profile, with significant resources coming from an endowment and donations. Most of its print revenue comes from subscriptions rather than from advertising. Nonetheless, industry trends led Brennon Slattery of \"PC World\" to predict this may be the first of a series of major print newspaper closings."}

With the AP Poll's most recent publication on Sunday morning, the Crimson Tide, only one of four Division I teams undefeated and the only one undefeated in the Southeastern Conference, has taken the top spot for the first time during the regular football season since 1980.\nThe \"Tuscaloosa News\" remarked that the win on Saturday was a good gift for coach Nick Saban, who turned 57 on Friday. On Sunday, a brief statement was issued to reporters by Saban, in which he said, \"We appreciate the interest shown to our team, but rankings at this time of the season do not define anything relative to the postseason...Our concern is our preparation to play a very good LSU team [Saturday], and these external factors can not affect our planning, schedule or focus on the task at hand.\"\nThe game next Saturday is crucial to the Crimson Tide, as it will effectively decide who will play in the Southeastern Conference championship game. Louisiana State University (LSU), a powerhouse in past seasons, suffered two losses this season.

A few bones believed to be his were found a short distance from the crash. Teeth marks were found in his ID card, leaving authorities to believe his body was moved by animals.

Yesterday the pharmaceutical firm Genentech announced that it is requesting accelerated approval for its drug Avastin (bevacizumab) as a glioblastoma treatment. Avastin is already approved for use on lung, colon and breast cancers. Promising results in Phase II clinical trials led the company to seek early approval before Phase III trials for glioblastoma, a condition that has high mortality rates and few treatment options. The FDA sometimes grants early approval of treatments for life-threatening conditions when early studies show good results.\nDr. Hal Barron, chief medical officer for Genentech, told the press \"There has been no substantial improvement in the treatment of glioblastoma in more than 20 years... This is a devastating disease and people with glioblastoma desperately need new treatment options.\" Glioblastoma is an incurable condition with a median survival time of less than one year. Only about five percent of patients survive for five years. In Phase II clinical trials of Avastin on 167 patients, 43 percent of patients saw no increase in tumor size after six months. Existing tumors decreased in size by at least 50 percent in twenty-eight percent of patients. Phase III clinical trials for Avastin as a brain tumor treatment are scheduled to begin early next year. The trials will evaluate Avastin together with chemotherapy and radiation.\nAvastin works by inhibiting angiogenesis: the development of new blood vessels. Fast growing tumors such as glioblastoma need a rapidly growing supply of blood vessels in order to spread. Side effects associated with Avastin include hypertension, convulsion, intestinal perforation, and slow wound healing. There were two patient deaths associated with side effects from the study, yet the study as a whole yielded a significantly longer average life expectancy than glioblastoma patients normally have. \nApproximately 19,000 primary brain tumors were diagnosed in the United States last year. 60 percent were gliomas, including glioblastoma. In most of North America and Europe, incidence of glioblastoma each year is 2-3 cases per 100,000 persons.\nA single course of Avastin treatment costs approximately US$40,000. News reports gave conflicting information about Avastin sales for the first 9 months of 2008, with figures ranging from US$700 million to US$2 billion. Sales included approved treatments plus off-label use. Genentech shares recently rose 0.8 percent to US$83.64. Relatively few pharmaceutical firms are developing treatments for glioblastoma. Others include Pfizer in collaboration with Avant Immunotherapeudics for vaccine development. Myriad Genetics is developing a drug Azixa for primary and metastatic brain tumors."}

Bent had made a prediction that Judgment Day would occur on October 31, 2008. Bent had previously made a prediction reported on in the documentary film \"End of a World Cult\" that the world would end on October 31, 2007.\nSarah Montoya, a lawyer representing Bent, said in a statement to the \"Albuquerque Journal\" that members of the group were disappointed when Bent's prophecy failed to come true, \"but they understand that life goes on\". \nMembers of the Lord Our Righteousness Church, based in Strong City, New Mexico, believed that they were going to go to heaven on Friday night. \"We don't anticipate any future beyond Oct. 31.,\" Bent's son Jeff Bent had told the \"Albuquerque Journal\" in a telephone interview last Thursday.\nAccording to \"The Santa Fe New Mexican\", the 45 adult followers of Bent in Strong City recently ended a two-week long fast whose purpose was to protest charges against Bent of child sexual abuse. The Associated Press reported that Bent himself has not eaten food since October 16, and a post on the organization's website stated he began a \"no water or food\" fast Thursday after he was taken from the group's compound.\nBent was arrested last week on failure to appear at a court hearing. New Mexico State District Judge Gerald E. Baca issued a bench warrant after Bent failed to appear in court, and he was arrested last Thursday by Union County sheriff's deputies. \nHe stands accused of sex crimes against female members of his group. Bent was arrested in May 2008, and faces indictments on four counts: two of contributing to the delinquency of a minor, and two counts of criminal sexual contact of a minor. In an October hearing, Judge Baca ruled against a defense request for an evidentiary hearing where two girls would have described naked encounters with Bent. The judge instead ruled that the girls can tell their story to a jury in the upcoming trial, which is set to begin on November 17. "}

The plane lost cabin pressure and hypoxia caused the incapacitation of the passengers and flight crew. It is thought that the conscious flight attendant had used multiple crew oxygen cylinders to outlast the others on board. Investigators also believe that the equipment had been left in the wrong setting after testing by maintenance engineers and never checked before flight.\nAfter failing to resuscitate the pilot-in-command, the trainee pilot turned off the autopilot and attempted an emergency landing at Athens International Airport, which the aircraft had been circling in a holding pattern awaiting human input. However, the aircraft ran out of fuel before reaching the runway."}

Children who live in households with at least one adult smoker are more likely to be underfed, according to Dr. Cynthia Cutler-Triggs of the New York University School of Medicine and Bellevue Hospital.\nDr. Cutler-Triggs's study measured food insecurity, a concept used by the U.S. Department of Agriculture since the 1990s to measure the frequency of skipped meals and how often people go to bed hungry. Researchers examined data on 8,817 households from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. The study parsed the survey, which tracked the health and nutritional status of adults and children in the United States, according to smoking habits and household income.\n17 percent of children in low income smoking households suffered food insecurity, compared to an overall food insecurity rate of 11 percent among children. Severe food insecurity occurred among 3.2 percent of children in smoking households. \nOnly 0.9 of children from nonsmoking households had severe food insecurity. Similar rises in food insecurity occurred among adults from smoking households, but researchers were more concerned about the effects on the health of growing children. \nDr. Michael Weitzman, chairman of pediatrics at New York University School of Medicine, told \"The Washington Post\", \"We know that there are long-term consequences of food insecurity for children. They are more likely to do poorly in school, to have iron deficiency and anemia, and to have behavioral and social problems.\"\nAn estimated 2 percent to 20 percent of smokers' incomes goes for tobacco, which may compete with the grocery budget in some families. Household income accounted for some but not all of the difference in food security. Dr. Weitzman expressed concern that a continued recession may worsen the problem. \"If the economic downturn persists, both food insecurity and adults smoking are likely to increase...

The measure was rejected with the same percentage as Proposition 8, 52% to 48%. Meanwhile in Colorado, voters rejected a measure that would define life as beginning at conception. While the measure did not specifically mention abortion it would have required legislators and courts to confront legal rights for fetuses - effectively preventing abortion. The measure was defeated in a wide margin, 73% to 27%\nIn South Dakota, voters also defeated an anti-abortion measure which would have outlawed abortion in all cases except in the case of rape, incest or if the mother's health was in serious question. If passed, the law would most likely have been challenged as unconstitutional.\nIn Michigan, voters approved a measure which legalizes medical marijuana. Meanwhile, in Massachusetts, voters approved a ballot question that decriminalizes possession of small amounts of marijuana in which the possession of an ounce or less would be punishable by a $100 fine. The measure will also require minors under the age 18 to participate in and complete a drug awareness program and do community service.

This stunned supporters of the income tax, who mounted a fierce campaign against the measure this time warning Massachusetts residents that repealing the income tax would have drastic effects on the state's finances, leading to cuts in services, education and local aid.\nFinally, voters passed a question which bans dog racing in Massachusetts, which will lead to the closure of Massachusetts' two greyhound racing tracks, Raynham-Taunton Greyhound Park and Wonderland Greyhound Park. \nThe campaign against dog racing was headed up by the Committee to Protect Dogs and endorsed by GREY2K USA and the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals along with other animal protection organizations who claimed that dog racing was inhumane as the dogs were stuffed into cramped cages and endured injuries. The measure was opposed by the park owners including George Carney who owns the Rayham-Taunton park and Charles Sarkis, a restaurateur who owns Wonderland.\n\"We did it. We did it for the dogs,\" said Carey Thiel, executive director of GREY2K USA. \"For 75 years, greyhounds in our state have endured terrible confinement and suffered serious injuries. We're better than that,\" Thiel added.\nOne campaign supporter, Sandy Bigelow noted, \"It means everything. We've worked so hard for the dogs and they heard us. It feels so good. Oh, God, it feels so good.\"\nGeorge Carney said of the results, \"It's not a very pleasant thing right now. Some of these people have been here 40 years. Here's a company that did nothing wrong, paid their federal taxes on time, paid the town on time. The town is going to be a severe loser, and a lot of people here dedicated their life to the company.\"\nBoth sides used emotionally-charged advertisements, the anti-racing side showing \u201csad-eyed greyhounds,\u201d while the pro-racing side highlighted the workers who would be out of work when the tracks close.\nBoth measures must now come before the Massachusetts Governor's Council for approval. \nA ballot initiative approved by voters in the north-western state of Washington will make it the second state to permit physician-assisted suicide. \nInitiative 1000 follows the ten-year-old example of the Death With Dignity Act of neighboring Oregon, and will allow physicians to prescribe a lethal dose of medication for a terminally ill patient to administer themselves. \nIt was approved by a margin of 16%, and the \u2018Yes\u2019 campaign outspent the \u2018No\u2019 campaign by more than three-to-one. The law comes into effect in 2009."}

Both have been convicted and sentenced to jail terms in Thailand. The email instructs airlines not to facilitate travel for the couple to return to the UK. Reports indicate that the deposed and convicted ex-PM is currently in China with plans to travel to the Philippines this weekend. The whereabouts of his wife are not currently known.\nThaksin and his wife, Potjaman Shinawatra, have spent much of the past two years living in exile in the UK after jumping bail on charges against them in Thailand. The visa revocation, issued by Immigration Liaison Manager Andy Gray of the UK embassy in Bangkok, will come as a harsh blow to Thaksin, who had expressed a strong interest in remaining in England as an exile, asserting that charges back home were politically motivated.\nLawyers involved in the successful prosecution of Thaksin were known to be in the process of drawing up extradition papers to submit to the UK's Home Office; with his chosen country of refuge now in doubt it may become more difficult to have him returned to Thailand to serve his two year sentence for corruption. In an email to Wikinews the UK Home Office declined to comment on the extradition, specifying it was policy not to discuss individual cases.\nExtradition would have been covered under a treaty drawn up in 1911 between the two countries and the onus would have been on Thailand to prove that the conviction ties up with similar UK laws. Claims by Thaksin that such a request would have been politically motivated would be considered by the court under the UK's Extradition Act. The Home Office also confirmed that Thaksin's diplomatic passport would not have exempted him from such proceedings.\nPotjaman, Thaksin's wife, escaped prosecution in the corruption case over a Bangkok land deal, however she already faces a three year sentence for tax evasion. Visas for the couple's children were unaffected by the action, they remain free to travel to and from the UK.\nDespite his self-imposed exile, the ex-PM who was deposed by a bloodless coup in 2006 has remained in the news and public consciousness in Thailand. Several high-profile court cases alleging corruption and malfeasance during his time as premier and leader of the now-banned Thai Rak Thai (lit: \"Thais love Thais\") political party remain outstanding.\nLast Saturday, he gave a telephone address to pro-government protesters rallying at the country's national stadium in Bangkok. Members of the current government, which is accused of being a proxy for Thaksin, managed to amass tens of thousands of red-shirted supporters to listen to the address. The rally has been condemned by the Law Society of Thailand as contempt of court, and their statement on the November 1 phone-in warned that media repeating its content could be added to the defendants in any legal proceedings.\nDuring the phone-in Thaksin said, \"Nobody can bring me back to Thailand, except royal kindness of HM the King or the power of the people\"; this can be construed as an appeal for a royal pardon, or for his supporters to be more vocal."}

ISRO Chairman G Madhavan Nair said everything onboard Chandrayaan-1 is working fine.\nThe lunar orbit insertion (LOI) began at 4:50 P.M and lasted for 817 seconds (14 minutes). The ground control station at Peenya in Bangalore remotely fired the satellite's rockets to move it into its new trajectory. This was considered to be a most critical moment of the entire mission. The satellite has now been placed in a 7,502 km X 504 km elliptical orbit around the Moon. Chandrayaan will be gradually lowered to a circular orbit at a distance of 100 km from the lunar surface. Once the circular orbit is achieved, Chandrayaan will eject the Moon Impact Probe, a lunar probe, to impact on the moon's surface. Besides carrying three important scientific instruments, the lunar probe will also carry a picture of the Indian national flag. \nWith this, India will become both the fourth country to place a flag on the moon and the fifth country to send a spacecraft to the moon.

The proposition passed with 52% support, and would amend the California constitution to ban gay marriage, which was recently made legal by court order. The temple is located in Los Angeles, California.\nAccording to a member of the Los Angeles Police Department, the Temple grounds were vandalized by protesters, and a group of apparently non-LDS Hispanic women attempting to remove critical signs from temple grounds were attacked and beaten before police stepped in and arrested those involved.\nProtesters have claimed that the church's institution made small cash donations to the Proposition 8 campaign, though no evidence has yet surfaced to corroborate the claims. It appears that many members of the church (also known as Mormons) donated to the \"Yes on 8\" campaign. \nJeff Flint, a strategist for Yes on 8, has criticized the protest and related negative media placed on those Latter-day Saints who supported Proposition 8: \"I am appalled at the level of Mormon-bashing that went on during the Proposition 8 campaign and continues to this day. If this activity were directed against any other church, if someone put up a website that targeted Jews or Catholics in a similar fashion for the mere act of participating in a political campaign, it would be widely and rightfully condemned.\"\nIn addition to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, the proposition was supported by other Christian groups, the Hispanic population of California by a slight majority, and overwhelmingly by California's African-American population. Protests have targeted these communities as well. F. Damion Barela, who had obtained a gay marriage to his husband five months ago, said, \"I'm disappointed in the Californians who voted for this.\" In particular, he was bothered that some ethnic groups supported the ban: \"To them I say, 'Shame on you because you should know what this feels like.'\"\nProtests of up to 20,000 people were held in other cities throughout the country in opposition to Proposition 8, and some Latter-day Saints have left the church over the matter. Several other churches have been vandalized by protesters since its passage.\nSimilar constitutional provisions were passed in Florida and Arizona during the election, and such provisions already exist in 27 other states, with a further 15 featuring statutory bans on same sex marriages."}
