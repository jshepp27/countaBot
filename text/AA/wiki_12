The reason given was for eating during the fast of Ramadan, and thus not observing what is believed by Muslims to be one of the five pillars of Muslim faith. \nAccording to a leading Jean-Mermoz School official, \"it was a simple incident, not premeditated,\" and commented that the story did not warrant French television coverage. In a \"Le Progr\u00e8s\" update report dated October 11, 2006, \"the sequence of the facts are better known.\" Allegedly, three students were taken aside by several schoolboys, who exclaimed, \"You are eating!\" to one of the students in the group, a girl who was eating a sandwich, and who then threw stones (possibly gravel) which \"lightly injured the girl in the head.\" The prosecutor of the Republic of Lyons noted that the word 'Ramadan' had not been uttered during the incident. \"It is very necessary to know that the political awareness of these boys is limited,\" he added. Two of the four alleged perpetrators who did acknowledge these acts were suspended for four days, and the school's 250 students were assembled by the principal shortly after the event \"for a solemn reminder of the law.\" The girl's parents lodged a formal complaint. \nAccording to the sources, this is not the first time such an act has occurred at the school. The incident has been cause for strong emotions among the French educational community, which is sensitive to issues surrounding France's Muslim community, especially those regarding the treatment of women.\nAzzedine Gacci, president of the Regional Council of Muslim Worship (CRCM), stated: \"[S]i les faits sont av\u00e9r\u00e9s, ils sont inacceptables...\")\u2014\u201c...if the facts are proven (to be true), they are unacceptable\u201d. The young girl in question was in her menstruating cycle at the time of the incident. He expressed regret that some Muslim youths do not know that \"femmes indispos\u00e9es\" (women in an exceptional state) are exempted by the Koran from observing certain aspects of Ramadan injunctions.

The United States, Japan, China, and South Korea have all urged North Korea to abandon its nuclear program. North Korea released a statement on October 3 saying that it would soon conduct a nuclear test, and also emphasized that it would neither use nuclear weapons first nor aid other countries in nuclear proliferation. The state claimed that it would only use the weapons as a deterrent against the United States and its allies. In 2003, U.S. President George W. Bush and South Korean President Roh Moo-hyun said that they \"would not tolerate\" a nuclear North Korea. China and Japan have also expressed concern.\nU.S. officials have reported that the government of the People's Republic of China was given a 20-minute advance warning that the test was about to occur. The PRC sent an emergency alert to Washington through the United States embassy in Beijing and President George W. Bush was told shortly after 10 p.m. that a test was imminent by National Security Advisor Stephen Hadley.\nRumors of an impending nuclear test have circulated since North Korea announced its weapons capability. The Natural Resources Defense Council estimates that North Korea may have up to 10 or 12 nuclear devices already built.\nAccording to North Korea's Central News Agency, the country conducted an underground nuclear test successfully without any radioactive leakage. Underground tests, if they fully contain the nuclear blast, can result in a minimum of nuclear fallout contamination. If confirmed, the nuclear test by North Korea would be the first nuclear test since the dual Indian and Pakistani nuclear tests of 1998.\nThe U.S. Geological Service has recorded a magnitude 4.2 event in eastern North Korea at 01:35:27 (UTC), or 10:35:27 North Korean local time.\nU.S. President George W Bush speaking at the White House ahead of an emergency closed session of the called the action \"unacceptable ... North Korea has defied the will of the international community and the international community will respond.\" He also described it as \"a threat to international peace and security. The United States condemns this provocative act.\"\nBush contacted the leaders of Russia, China, Japan and South Korea, the other nations that have been engaged in negotiations with North Korea. All have already denounced the action. China using the harshest language yet against its old war time ally, calling the test \"brazen\". Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe insisted on \"decisive action.\"\nSome experts are speculating that the test may push the United Nations to back sanctions against the North Koreans, Japan's U.N Ambassador Kenzo Oshima has told reporters in New York that the United States is drafting the resolutions, which could range from trade restrictions to monetary dealings and even a sea based blockade. The sitting members have strongly condemned the nuclear test.\nIn the first significant reaction to the announcement the South Korean government has decided to suspend a scheduled shipment of its emergency relief aid to its northern neighbor. An official from the Unification Ministry said \"A ship was scheduled to depart ... carrying 4,000 tons of concrete on Tuesday, but we decided to delay the shipment under the current circumstances.\"\nThe yield of the device has not been conclusively confirmed. Fox News has reported the yield at below 4 kilotons, citing a unspecified senior Bush administration official; however, Russian military sources estimate the yield as between 5-15 kilotons. The Korea Institute of Geoscience and Mineral Resources stated its estimate of the yield as 550 tons, but later scaled it up to 800 tons.\nA senior seismologist at the Australian Seismology Research Centre said that a 4.2 magnitude quake would roughly correspond with a one kiloton explosion, but would not say it was conclusive, since it depends on the type of rock that the test was set off in.\nIt has been reported that the Korea Exchange, South Korea's main stock exchange, suspended trading for five minutes upon hearing news of the test."}

The trouble began when MNS activists allegedly tore down a poster of Shiv Sena chief Bal Thackeray outside the SIES college. The Shiv Sainiks retaliated by bringing down a poster featuring Raj Thackeray (Bal Thackeray's nephew and founder of the MNS) outside Raj Bhavan. The two groups faced off outside the Sena Bhavan in Central Mumbai and soon began pelting stones at each other.\nThe police had to resort to \"lathi\"-charges and the use of tear-gas to dispel the crowds. The situation calmed down after the appearance of Shiv Sena Executive-President Udhav Thackeray and his cousin Raj at the scene. Udhav even appealed to his followers to return to their homes, saying, \"The police will take necessary action. This is happening because many people are joining us from MNS. The defections have started and that is why they are resorting to such actions,\".\nNonetheless, shops in Dadar remained closed and traffic was diverted away from the area. The Rapid Action Force has been deployed to control the situation, and has asked for reinforcements. Four riot control units have also been dispatched to maintain the peace."}

Use will be made of forensic accounting and of methods similar to those employed by the code breakers at Bletchley Park. With the help of computing power to discover relations between bits of information, they cracked the German Enigma code during WWII. Gordon Brown ranks the impact of forensic accounting at the present time with the use of fingerprinting in the 19th century and of DNA in the late 20th Century.\nSpeaking to Chatham House, The Royal Institute of International Affairs, Brown defined the most dangerous sources of finance for terrorists as being charities, money service businesses and financial transactions such as bureaux de change, cheque cashers and money remitters. There will be a new licensing system requiring firms to keep more detailed records of transactions. Tougher action against non-compliance is promised. New proposals about money laundering are being prepared. \nThe new Order will empower the Treasury, for the first time, to use \"closed source evidence\" from classified intelligence to freeze the assets of suspects. A \"special advocate procedure\" will be put in place to ensure \"fair and consistent hearing of cases\". If evidence shows it to be necessary, it is Brown's opinion that suspects should be held, without a charge being brought, for more than the present 28 days. \nThe Government has been defeated once already in Parliament in an attempt, in the Terrorism Act 2006, to increase the present 28 days of detention without charge to 90 days. Public opinion was very divided on that proposal and feelings in Parliament ran high with talk of a police state and of the Government pandering to public opinion."}

But the National party says that with the big surplus they can afford to cut both business tax and personal tax.\nHowever finance minister, Doctor Michael Cullen, said the amount of cash available for tax cuts will be clearer in December.\nJohn Key, finance spokesman for National, said: \"The surplus makes a mockery of claims made by Michael Cullen before the last election that tax cuts were unaffordable and would put at risk core primary services. When surpluses are this enormous, any veiled hope the government had that it is not overtaxing people will rapidly evaporate.\"\nCullen said: \"The Government's \"robust\" financial position was a firm base for the future, but it was not an indication of how much room he had for tax cuts or spending.\"\nPhil O'Reilly, Chief Executive of Business New Zealand said: \"The business tax reduction from 33 to 30 cents planned for April 2008 could be brought forward to April 2007.

Like the dark matter version of Galileo's experiment of dropping items to the ground from the tower of Pisa, theorists from the California Institute of Technology and the Canadian Institute for Theoretical Astrophysics in Toronto found that there is no more attractive force associated with dark matter than with normal matter. This finding helps to eliminate other theoretical models created to explain phenomena that required an extra force within dark matter. The results of the work are presented in the September 28th 2006 issue of Physical Review Letters.\nDark matter has long fascinated scientists ever since its effects were detected in the 1970s. It is matter that does not emit or reflect light and so cannot be detected directly, but it is understood to exist from its gravitational effects on visible matter, namely its effect on the speed of stars around galaxies. Scientists still don't know what makes up dark matter. \nThe work done was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations made of the Sagittarius galaxy. The effect the team was looking for would be caused by tidal forces between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter. Just like the moon exerts a pull on the earth, causing tides, so does the Milky Way exert a force on the Sagittarius galaxy. The scientists were able to conclude that the dark matter affect other dark matter in the same way regular matter does. Kesden and Kamionkowski, the co-author from the California Institute of Technology, tried more than one distribution of the dark matter but found the current theory fits best with the data. This theory says that most dark matter around a galaxy is located around a galaxy in a kind of halo, and is made of lots of small particles.\nThe prediction that there may be an extra force associated with dark matter appeared in part to explain strange phenomena in the universe. One such phenomenon is the universal structure of galaxies. Galaxies tend to clump themselves together, with voids in between. Computer simulations showed that these voids contained dark matter. It had been theorized that this occurred because there was an extra force in dark matter clumping it together. Kesden mentions that these structures may be caused by other forces that affect only regular matter, like electricity and magnetism, but not dark matter. These forces would clump normal matter together and not affect the dark matter. They now conclude that the force is not gravitational.\nScientists, such as Glennys Farrar, a theoretical physicist at New York University, who examined the paper's arguments, said that the researchers made too many assumptions about their simulated dark matter. Kamionskowski responded with, \"We know pretty well where the dark matter is in the Milky Way.\" Therefore they could extrapolate that for other galaxies. However, he continued to mention that other scientists might want a more detailed comparison of the simulation with the data. Kesden states that there will always be doubters. He says a researcher then has to think, \"What kind of tricks can you play to hide such an [extra force]? So it's a game. You have to be sneaky to rule everything out.\" As far as his game goes, \"Ours was just for a typical scenario, assuming there wasn't a conspiracy to hide the force.\" "}

Over 40 trains were cancelled and the scare caused mass havoc in the centre of Geneva.\n\"\"Ce message s'addresse aux forces de Police: deux bombes ont \u00e9t\u00e9 pos\u00e9es \u00e0 deux endroits strat\u00e9giques.

One at Cornavin [Geneva's main station] and one at the Globus shopping centre. Our demands are as follows...' \" The line then cut off. \nThat was the message received by the alert centre of the Police at 17:12 Swiss time (15:12 UTC), causing a massive evacuation. An anonymous caller called 117, (the Police number in Switzerland). At 18:00 Swiss time (16:00 UTC) in the middle of rush hour, railway police began asking people to leave the main station building [Cornavin]. In a matter of minutes the entire station was empty. All trains were stopped at Lausanne, or had they already by-passed the station, they were to halt at the nearest station ahead of them. \nThese halts caused the stranding of more than 30,000 passengers. All trams were stopped causing major traffic jams. There were similar happenings in the Globus department store where staff and shoppers were evacuated without hassle. As no bomb was found in the store, the \"Police Line\" bands were removed at 19:23 Swiss Time (17:23 UTC). However, the search continued in the bigger Cornavin station, but shortly after 20:00 Swis Time (18.00 UTC) the danger in the station was decided to be non-existent. \nChristophe Zawadaski, spokesperson for the police, explained that the search took a long time because the bomb-sniffing dogs found a suspicious bag in a train. But \"luckily there was no bomb inside\" he said.\nThe first train left again at 20:45 Swiss Time (18:45 UTC).\nThe SBB-CFF-FFS (The Swiss Federal Railway company) say around 40 trains were cancelled. Police say there are no links between this event and the alert of a possible attack on the UN building last week, which was leaked to the press, and was meant to be a top-secret document. Geneva police have not yet made an arrest following this false alert. But, if whoever caused this panic is caught, Swiss penal code decrees anyone accused of a fallacious tip-off is liable to three years in prison."}

Cory Lidle, a pitcher for the New York Yankees baseball team, was the registered owner of the aircraft and is believed to have been piloting it; his passport was found on the scene. The flight instructor was Tyler Stanger.\nThe plane, a Cirrus SR20 with registration number N929CD, hit the 26th floor of the Belaire Condominium, a 50 story brick luxury residential building on the Upper East Side at 524 East 72nd Street at York Avenue near the East River in Manhattan, New York City, of which the first 20 floors are a hospital. An eyewitness, present half a block from the building, reported that the plane hit the building, creating an enormous fireball, broke in two and crashed down onto on the street below. Authorities received a 911 call reporting a crash at 2:42 p.m. Eastern time.\nNew York City mayor Michael Bloomberg gave a press conference at approximately 5:20 p.m. Eastern time to report that the plane was occupied by a flight instructor and a student pilot, but as next-of-kin had not been able to be notified, the identities of the two people on the plane would not be released at this time. \nApartments were seen to be engulfed in flames. The FBI has stated that it was not an intentional attack. The New York area was grey and overcast during the time at crash; however, visibility was not hampered.\nAfter an hour and a half, the fire was extinguished by the FDNY. According to CNN Television ten people have been injured, six of them firefighters. The New York Times, however, reports that eleven firefighters have been injured.\nInitial reports suggested that a helicopter was involved, but the FAA has stated that it was a fixed-wing aircraft. CNN Television reported that it was a single-engine fixed-wing plane which left Teterboro Airport, a busy General Aviation airport in New Jersey, circled the Statue of Liberty was tracked on radar until it was lost near the 59th Street Bridge, that the plane may have been having fuel problems or fuel pump problems, and that it was \"a pilot in distress.\" \nWallace Sines, a source for CNN stated he believes the plane was a Cirrus SR-20 with an installed parachute, which did not deploy. The whole-plane parachute system may have saved the lives of the aircraft occupants had it been safely deployed clear of buildings, but the system is not designed to prevent the trauma associated with a plane impacting a builing. The Cirrus SR-20 was introduced in 2001 and the Cirrus line of 4-seater aircraft has since become one of the most purchased single engine aircraft in the world. The SR-20 does not normally carry an airline-style flight-data recorder, but some are equipped with GPS equipment which logs flight direction, speed and altitude.\nThe aircraft was owned by baseball player Cory Lidle. He was on board reported by AP. Lidle was killed, according to reports. CNN Television reported that the FBI stated he was at the controls as the only occupant of the plane, and that his passport was found on the ground below the accident.\nResponse.\nA little over an hour and a half after the crash, the fire was extinguished after 39 fire units and over 100 fire fighters responded.\nThe White House has said that there has been no change in the terror threat alert level and that President Bush is being updated constantly.\nLa Guardia airport was temporarily restricted to no take offs from other airports, however by 4:10 Eastern Time, CNN Television reported that all New York-area airports were open.\nCNN Television announced at 3:50 p.m. Eastern Time that as of a few minutes earlier, NORAD is putting fighter aircraft on patrol over certain major American cities as a precautionary measure similar to the actions taken after the 9/11 attacks as a \"just in case\" measure. It also reported that tomorrow is the 6th anniversary of the attack on the USS Cole in Aden, Yemen.\nMoments after the crash, there was a drop in the New York Stock Exchange, however it quickly returned to normal after it was reported that the crash was an accident.\nThe New York Yankees organization confirmed the plane is registered to Cory Lidle of the New York Yankees, who was planning to fly from New York to Florida, and that some unnamed member of the Yankees organization was on the plane.\nEyewitness accounts.\nOne eye-witness interviewed by the BBC stated: \"I was wondering why the plane was doing acrobatics and then the next thing I knew was that it had crashed into the building.\"\nShe also added that the plane was a small, white, 4-seater winged aircraft and not a helicopter as many news agencies were reporting it to be.\nCNN Television broadcast reports from eyewitnesses who reported:"}

In a commentary in Russian and English posted on FreeMediaOnline.org, Corti took issue with Russian media reports referring to President Putin's assertion that Politkovskaya's murder would benefit Russia's enemies. \nIn speaking with journalists in Dresden, Germany, on Tuesday, President Putin downplayed Politkovskaya's importance by saying that \"she had minimal influence on political life in Russia\" and that her murder caused \"much more harm than her publications did.\" FreeMediaOnline.org reported that pro-government media in Russia interpreted this comment as a signal to journalists that the value of Politkovskaya's reporting and, by implication, the work of other journalists should be measured by how much damage they cause to Russia's reputation.\nCorti wrote that Politkovskaya's death was not a blow to Russia's reputation but a blow to those who brought shame to Russia by their \"evil deeds.\" Politkovskaya's reporting exposed numerous murders, cases of torture and other human rights abuses in Chechnya and in other parts of the former Soviet Union. Her reports angered the Russian establishment and she was frequently harassed and detained by Russia's security services.\nCorti also wrote that the pro-Kremlin media reaction to Politovskaya's murder has caused many pro-democracy Russians to doubt whether they can still live in Russia. He countered, however, that her death has a greater meaning in showing that the struggle for human rights and for the dignity of all men has always required sacrifices. According to Corti, Politkovskaya loved Russia and wanted it to become a fully democratic country in which people respect each other, a country without torture, and a country in which the dignity of every person takes priority over everything else.\nCorti was in charge of Radio Liberty's Russian broadcasts from 1998 to 2003. He now works as an indepenent journalist and is a member of the FreeMediaOnline.org Board of Directors, a California-based nonprofit organization supporting media freedom worldwide."}

He said that the presence of UK troops \"exacerbates\" the problems \"not right across the country, but only in parts of it\".\nThe \"BBC\" reported that \"Downing Street\" had issued a short statement in response to the general's comments. It said: \"It's important that people remember that we are in Iraq at the express wish of the democratically elected Iraqi government, to support them under the mandate of a UN resolution.\"\nThe \"Scotsman\" in a \"Key Quote\" highlights the General saying - \"I think history will show that the planning for what happened after the initial successful war fighting phase was poor, probably based more on optimism than sound planning.\" \nThe \"Times\" draws attention to Blair's speech at the Labour Party Conference just two weeks ago saying why the troops will have to stay in Iraq - \"If we retreat now, hand Iraq over to al-Qaeda and sectarian death squads and Afghanistan back to al-Qaeda and the Taleban, we won't be safer; we will be committing a craven act of surrender that will put our future security in the deepest peril.\"\n\"Al Jazeera\" leads with the story, under a picture of a military ambulance being loaded, with the headline \"UK army chief pleads for Iraq pull out\", and quotes extracts from the General's interview with the \"Daily Mail\" including: \"We are in a Muslim country and Muslims' views of foreigners in their country are quite clear. As a foreigner, you can be welcomed by being invited in a country, but we weren't invited certainly by those in Iraq at the time. ... The military campaign we fought in 2003 effectively kicked the door in. Whatever consent we may have had in the first place, may have turned to tolerance and has largely turned to intolerance. That is a fact. I don't say that the difficulties we are experiencing round the world are caused by our presence in Iraq, but undoubtedly our presence in Iraq exacerbates them.\" The report concludes with a \"snapshot\" of the chaos in Baghdad by reporting an attack by gunmen on a TV station, when 11 staff were killed in the \"biggest attack yet on the media.\"\nThe \"Washington Post\" carries a report from \"Associated Press\" headed \"\u2018British Army Chief Who Called for Iraq Withdrawal 'Soon' Denies Rift With Government\"' in which the General is reported as saying that by 'soon' he meant a phased withdrawal over two or three years. He is reported as saying to \"Sky News\", \"We'll probably reduce our soldiers over the course of the next year or two or three -- let's wait and see. That's what I mean by sometime soon,\". He denied that he was attacking government policy saying to BBC radio \"We don't do surrender. We don't pull down white flags. We're going to see this through.\"\nAlongside a photograph of British soldiers rushing to the scene of a helicopter crash in Basra May 6 2006, \"Fox News\", commenting on the story, says \"Dannatt's comments are certain to infuriate Blair, who is President Bush's key ally in the Iraq war. It is highly unusual for a sitting British military commander to publicly criticize the government's foreign policy. ... Britain's involvement in Iraq has proved highly controversial from the outset. Millions protested on the streets in the lead up to the war in 2003, while high profile cabinet ministers have quit the government as a result of Tony Blair's support for the U.S.-led action.\"\n\"BBC News\" quotes Prime Minister Blair as saying that he agrees with \"every word\" the General said and that transcripts of later radio interviews showed Sir Richard was saying \"the same as we all are\". Subsequently, BBC New 24 at 9pm, reported that when Blair said he agreed with \"every word\", he was referring to what the General had been saying in radio and TV interviews this morning and not to the original interview reported in the \"Daily Mail\". This cleared up a misunderstanding evidenced in discussions among commentators and in \"Any Questions\" this evening. \nThe British Army Rumour Service, ARRSE, which describes itself as \" THE unofficial British Army community website\". asks viewers to complete the sentence \"Sir Richard Dannatt is...\". As at 18,50 13 October, of the 181 responses, 144 agreed that \"he was absolutely right\" and 26 that he was \"right only from military point of view\". The same site has blogs from troops in theatre.\nSir Malcolm Rifkind M.P., interviewed by Channel4 News, said that he agreed with every word the general said, but deplored the fact that he had said it while still a serving officer. Like Civil Servants, members of the Armed Forces owed allegiance to the democratically elected government of the day and should not express their personal opinions while still in uniform.\nThe U.S. White House spokesman Tony Snow responded to Friday press briefing questions from reporters by saying that General Danatt's comments were taken out of context, referring to back-pedalling clarifications that came later from Danatt. Snow said, [referring to later interviews conducted this morning], that \"he says that's not what he said. ... he said that he was misquoted and that \"\"that particular comment [in the original interview] was actually rather largely taken out of context.\"\"\nTwo major U.S. media outlets, ABC's \"World News with Charles Gibson\" and \"USA Today\", remained wary and made no news mention of the controversy ignited by the general's remarks until an official British political response emerged.\nThe story continues in the British press today, October 14, for example, in the \"Scotsman\" which reveals the it was Des Browne, the Defence Secretary who \"put pressure\" on the General to clarify his remarks in the series of media events that took place yesterday morning, the content of which the Prime Minister agreed wholeheartedly. However, many retired military personnel and some still on active service, have expressed their support for the General, in the media, including the now widely quoted \"British Army Rumour Service\". Some correspondents are disturbed to think that the military are becoming too involved in politics and that the authority of Parliament might become undermined. "}

Snow started to fall at around 12:00 pm EST on Thursday, October 12, heavy at times, and accompanied by thunder and lightning. Forecasters called the weather event \"unprecedented.\" A driving ban has been issued for Tonawanda, New York, Buffalo and Amherst where at least \"80% of roads in Amherst are impassible.\" The Buffalo Niagara International Airport opened at almost 3:30 p.m. [EST]. The New York State Throughway, or interstate 90 is closed from nearly Rochester, New York to Dunkirk, New York which is nearly 110 miles long. Motorists at the Williamsville, New York toll barrier are being turned around. A driving ban remains in effect while a state of emergency exists.\nWater will be shut off in 24 hours due to the lack of electricity to water pumps in the area and in a press conference, Mayor of Buffalo, Byron Brown issued a \"boil water advisory.\" Brown also said that \"70,000 of the 75,000 residents and businesses in Amherst are still without power.\" Residents are asked to bottle water and prepare for the outage. It is not known when water will be turned back on. At least 30 water intake pumps in Erie County, out of the 50 the county has, have no power. Officials say that businesses and residents could be out of water by 5:00 p.m. [EST].\nAt least 3 people have been killed due to the storm. Two of those people were killed in a two-car accident in Lancaster, New York, and the other person was in Niagara County and died after being hit by a vehicle. One person was crushed and killed by a falling tree in Amherst, while in the process of removing snow from his property.\nHundreds of trees have snapped in half as the snow began to fall around the city. Many trees, which still have their leaves, have broken into pieces as the heavy, wet snow began to pile up, as much as an inch an hour. Early on Thursday, the airport had received nearly 9 inches (23cm) of snow and climbing. The storm has caused many delays and cancellations in flights leaving from or going to Buffalo.\nNearly 400,000 people in Buffalo and surrounding suburbs are still without power and forecasters at the NOAA are warning people \"not to go outside in an area where heavy snow has fallen unless absolutely necessary.\" Power may not be restored to the affected areas until Sunday and possibly next week in some areas. Damage to trees is extensive with nearly every tree destroyed on Granger Place in Buffalo. \n\"This was extremely heavy snow and most of the trees still have most of their leaves ... we can't do a complete damage assessment until the snow stops falling,\" said spokesman for Niagara Mohawk, Western New York's area power company, Steve Brady.\n\"At 8 pm [on Thursday], utility companies were reporting over 50,000 customers without power. The reason for the widespread power outages has been the combination of very heavy water laden snow accumulating on the trees that still have most of their leaves. Tree's limbs break under the weight of the snow and bring down power lines as they fall,\" said a statement on NOAA's website. \n\"[This is the] snowiest day in 137 years [of weather records]. Six inches of snow occurred on October 13, 1909 and again on October 31, 1917,\" added the NOAA weather statement.\nMany business and nearly every school in Western New York are still closed due to the weather and the snow is forecasted to move south again over the Buffalo Metropolitan area, but snow amounts are not expected to be significant. Wind is expected to be strong and gusty which could bring down tree limbs which are broken but still attached to the tree. Some areas could se an additional 6 inches of snow by Saturday morning.\nThe flood watch takes effect at 2:00 p.m. [EST] and continues through Saturday."}

The outbreak affected people who ate contaminated bagged spinach. Shortly after the outbreak began, the contaminated spinach had been traced to the Salinas Valley region of California. Now, health officials say the contamination came from cattle manure.\nThe infected cattle manure was found on a ranch in Salinas Valley that is adjacent to the field that produced contaminated spinach. How precisely the infection was transported from the ranch to the spinach field is still unknown. Dr. Kevin Reilly of the California Department of Health Services said that \"we don't know if wild swine are playing a role or not, but we do know that on this particular ranch, there is a very large population of wild boar, and we have witnessed on this site that they have torn through fencing and under fencing and have the ability to access the field\". The bacteria could have been carried by wild animals from the cattle ranch to the spinach field. \nJoan Rose, a microbiologist and food safety expert at Michigan State University, commented that it is not surprising that cattle manure was the source of the infection. \"If you start to look at the pathogen levels even in untreated sewage, it's minor compared to animal waste\", she said."}

The five permanent members of the council and Japan met on Friday morning to discuss the wording of the bill which should be put to a vote by the full fifteen members this afternoon.\nThe ban also covers the purchase of large scale (such as tanks, ships, aircraft and missiles) but falls short of an outright ban on the import of military hardware.

State news channel KNCA said that the United States \"hostile policy ... has gone beyond the tolerance limit and a dangerous atmosphere of confrontation, reminiscent of that on the eve of war, is now prevailing on the Korean Peninsula.\" In response a Christopher Hill, US for the area, called the comments \"belligerent threats\" and said that the US was not nervous of them.\nA year ago North Korea walked out of 'six-party' talks (between both Koreas, the United States, China, Russia and Japan) that were set up to rid of its nuclear program in return for economic incentives.

The deputy first minister is speculated to be Martin McGuinness, the deputy leader of Sinn Fein.\nOne of the key issues is Sinn Fein's recognition of the Police Service of Northern Island, which replaced the controverisal Royal Ulster Constabulary. In a reassurance to unionists, the governments said they will not transfer duties over to the executive till 2008. Sinn Fein demanded an immediate transfer of power, possibly to a Sinn Fein minister. \"You can't have a democratic society unless the police are given full support,\" Blair said.\nAfter the election of ministers, three steps will take place. The Democratic Unionists will be given time to observe Sinn Fein and see if they are accepting policing. Also, in January, the Independent Monitoring Commission will give another report on the status of the Provisional Irish Republican Army revocation of violence. \nFinally in March, an electoral endorsement of the Saint Andrews Agreement will take place be it either through election or referendum. Most of the participants at the summit favored a referendum, except for Ian Paisley, according to an anoynoums source who wished not be identified as he no authorization to release details publicly.\nThe last two final steps take place in March 2007. On March 14, the nomination of the Executive will take place.\nFinally, if all goes well, the Northern Ireland Executive power-sharing government and full devolved Northern Ireland Assembly would be revived and take power on March 26, 2007. However, if the parties fail to set up the Executive or fail to agree \"at any stage\", the Assembly will be dissolved and direct rule from London will continue with input from the Republic of Ireland. \nTony Blair said the essential parts of the agreement are that all parties accept policing and the courts and have a clear agreement on power-sharing. \"So those are the two essential parts of it,\" Mr Blair said. \nIan Paisley, the notorious hardliner evangelist who has made his political career out of saying no to comprehensive reforms, eschewed his trademark fire-brand rhetoric offered a welcome and said that the province is \"at a crossroads.\" Paisley said of Ulster, \"a place where there is a road to democracy and where there is a road to anarchy.\" Further adding, \"I trust that we will see in the coming days the vast majority of people taking the road to democracy.\" \nBlair also added, \"We've been through different parts of this process many times over the past few years but I think this is a sound basis to proceed.\" He also said on the possible election of Paisley and McGuinness to their minister positions, \"I do not think anybody will find it easy to sit in an executive with people who they are deeply opposed to, or indeed hostile to.\"\nReferring to Sinn Fein, Paisley stated \"We will meet the requirements. But the IRA-Sinn Fein has got to meet those requirements. And when they do, we will really be on the way to peace in Northern Ireland.\" Paisley left St. Andrews quickly after attending the press conference in order to be with his family for his fiftieth wedding anniversary.\nSinn Fein leader, Gerry Adams offered a guarded welcome of the plans and stated \"requires thoughtful consideration and consultation.\" He made no mention of policing. However, he stated the restoration of power-sharing was an \"an enormous prize. Common sense, political realism and the interests of all sections of our people demand that we achieve this.\"\nSir Reg Empey, the leader of the Ulster Unionist Party said that the agreement was \"Belfast for slower learners.\" He added \"Sinn Fein will sign up to the PSNI being the only force of law and order and Ian Paisley, or a colleague, will share the joint office of first and deputy first minister with Martin McGuinness in a mandatory coalition.\"\nLeader of the more moderate nationalist Social Democratic and Labour Party, Mark Durkan stated that welcome progress had been made in devolution and that his party would continue working towards this.\nThe leader of the cross-community non-sectarian Alliance Party of Northern Ireland, David Ford said of the summit that the outcome of the summit was a mix of \"of challenges and opportunities\". He added, \"Despite all that remains to be done, there is now at least a sense of hope for a shared future.\"\nDirect rule from London has been in place since the Assembly and Executive dissolved in 2002 over allegations of IRA spying ring."}

They presented their contribution during Swiss Energy Week. \nThe automobile, which has and will be manufactured by the Swiss company Horlacher, is 75% lighter than an average family car and guzzles a tenth of the fuel thanks to vastly improved aerodynamics.\nOne drawback to this car is that it has none of the modern safety features found in many cars to-day. But the FIT team is designing technology that lets cars communicate with each other to avoid collisions, using similar computer systems to those in aircraft.\n\"This car does compromise on style, speed and comfort, but you can't have a free lunch,\" says Lino Guzzella, one of the centre's members\n\"\"Business as usual\" is no longer an option. If we are to survive in the future, we will have to drastically reduce carbon emissions.\" Guzzella continued. \nThere are approximately 800 million cars on this planet and in Switzerland there are 500 cars per 1,000 people, compared with 800 in the United States and less than 50 per 1,000 in India and China.\nSwiss drivers also favour more powerful, polluting vehicles than the rest of western Europe. According to the European Automobile Manufacturers Association, the main lobbying group of the automobile industry in the European Union, the average car in Switzerland has a 2 litre engine compared with 1.6 litres in neighbouring countries.\n\"The Swiss think they are better at cutting harmful emissions than anyone else, but they are not,\" says researcher Peter de Haan van der Weg.\nHe believes Switzerland should introduce incentives to make people buy cleaner cars. Some countries already have such schemes: the US awards tax breaks worth up to $3,000 and the Netherlands offers \u20ac6,000 to green car owners. \nThe Swiss authorities are currently thinking about two similar options presented by the city of Bern and the centre-left Social Democratic Party.\n\"Individuals are not capable of understanding the big picture because it is difficult for people to look 50 years into the future,\" Mr. De Haan van der Weg said.\n\"Therefore it is necessary to have government regulations to force changes that will benefit the environment.\""}

The last time a Currie Cup final ended in a draw was in the 1989 season. The game was played in front of a packed Vodacom Park, with all tickets being sold out on the first day.\nThe final was the first in Bloemfontein since the 1994 season at Springbok Park, where Transvaal defeated the Free State team. The 2006 final is the third in succession which features both the Blue Bulls and Cheetahs, with the teams being the finalists since the 2004 season. The Blue Bulls won the 2004 final at Loftus Versfeld, and then in 2005 the Cheetahs defeated them at Loftus in the final. The 2006 season kicked off in June, with the regular season finishing after 14 rounds in late September. The Cheetahs finished in first place on the season table, with the Blue Bulls behind them in second place. The Blue Bulls defeated Western Province in the semi finals, with the Cheetahs defeating the Sharks to win theirs to set up the final.\nThe scoring opened up in the third minute with a penalty kick to the Cheetahs through Willem de Waal. Successful with the kick, the Cheetahs opened up a three point lead over the Bulls. Phillip Burger scored for the Cheetahs, and JP Nel scored his side's first try of the match, three minutes before halftime. However the conversion attempt was wide. The Cheetahs entered the halftime break leading the Bulls 14 points to eight.\nFour minutes into the second half the Blue Bulls scored their second try, with Marius Delport gathering up a kick to score. Morn\u00e9 Steyn kicked the conversion, taking the score to 15 to 14, making it the first time in the match that the Blue Bulls were leading. The Cheetahs took back the lead in the 49th minute, with another penalty kick to take them to 17-15. A long range kick from the Blue Bulls put them back in front in the 55th minute, to lead by one point, 18-17. The Cheetahs hit back through Kabamba Floors, scoring a try minutes later. The Cheetahs extended their lead in the 60th minute with another penalty kick. With three minutes remaining, Nel scored his second try and Steyn kicked the conversion to draw the Blue Bulls level 25-all with around two minutes left in the match.\nAfter 80 minutes the game was taken into extra time after a short break in play. The Blue Bulls were awarded a penalty after three minutes of extra time and Steyn kicked it successfully to take the Blue Bulls to 28-25. The Cheetahs came close to equalising in the seveth minute of extra time with a penalty kick, but the ball hit the upright and bounced away. Meyer Bosman kicked a penalty for the Cheetahs in the 14th minute of extra play, drawing the scores equal at 28-all. The game ended soon after, ending in a draw."}

The most holy month in the Muslim calendar, which will take place from the 21 July to 20 August in 2012, involves fasting during daylight hours and will affect an estimated 3,000 athletes. \nJoanna Manning Cooper, spokesman for the games said: \"We did know about it when we submitted our bid and we have always believed that we could find ways to accommodate it.\"\nNevertheless, this will come as a huge embarrassment for the organisers who have tried to ensure the event involve all of Britain's ethnic communities.\nA quarter of the athletes who took part in the were from predominantly Muslim countries and the fast will put any athletes involved at a clear disadvantage.\nThe chairman of the Islamic Human Rights Commission, Massoud Shadjared said: \"This is going to disadvantage the athletes and alienate the Asian communities by saying they don't matter. It's not only going to affect the participants, it's going to affect all the people who want to watch the games.\"\nThe president of the National Olympic Committee of Turkey, Togay Bayalti, said: \"This will be difficult for Muslim athletes. They don't have to observe Ramadan if they are doing sport and travelling but they will have to decide whether it is important to them. \"It would be nice for the friendship of the Games if they had chosen a different date.\"\nThe games will run from the 27 July to 12 August to coincide with the British Summer holidays. The summer holidays are a six week period running from mid July to early September. During this time, public transportation is generally less crowded and it will be easier to find the 70,000 volunteers needed to keep the games running. The International Olympics Committee has specified that the games must take place between July 15 to August 31. Giselle Davies, IOC spokesperson said, \"We give a window to the five bid cities. The host city selects the dates within that window.\"\nThe organisers are working with the Muslim Council of Great Britain to find ways around the problem."}

The quake, centered approximately 6 miles southwest of Puak\u014d on the west side of Hawai`i Island (the Big Island), was felt throughout the entire state, causing a statewide power outage.\nNo tsunami warning was issued as a result of the quake; however, a tsunami measuring around 0.1 meters (four inches) was recorded. There were 50 aftershocks reported after the quake, the strongest being a 5.8 tremor reported at about 17:14 UTC (7:14 a.m. local time).\nThere were no fatalities reported and only scattered reports of minor injuries.\nElectric power was lost statewide shortly after the quake. As of about 8:00 p.m. HST, power was restored to all the neighbor islands, but Hawaiian Electric personnel still had work to go on Oahu, the island with the highest population. Power was eventually restored to most areas of Oahu by midnight. \nStructural damage occurred at Kona Hospital, where ceiling tiles fell and electricity was lost, forcing an evacuation of patients to Hilo Medical Center on the other side of the island. Damage was also reported at the Honokaa Long-term Care Facility and the Royal Kona Resort. \nHawaii Governor Linda Lingle, who was in Kona at the time of the earthquake, issued an emergency declaration for the entire state of Hawaii at about 11:00 a.m. local time (2300 UTC Sunday).\nAir service in Hawaii was temporarily suspended shortly after the quake as airports were forced to operate on emergency power. The power outage caused delays to incoming and outgoing flights, as TSA agents had to conduct manual searches of all bags. Airlines have canceled numerous flights scheduled to depart Honolulu International Airport Sunday evening. \nCommunication links are problematic. Most radio stations lost power and stopped broadcasting immediately after the quake. (Metroblogging Hawaii) Honolulu radio station KSSK, operating on emergency generators, became a central information source for Oahu residents. A landslide has blocked at least one major highway from a section of a cliff at Kealakekua Bay.\nUSGS Volcano Observatory equipment has not been significantly damaged. Monitoring stations report \"no significant changes in the past 24 hours\" of the eruption of the K\u012blauea volcano. \nAccording to USGS records, this earthquake is the fourth largest Hawaiian earthquake in the last 100 years. Previous earthquakes include a magnitude 7.2 quake in 1975, a magnitude 6.9 quake in 1951, and a magnitude 6.8 quake in 1938. The last magnitude 6.7 quake was in 1983.\nExternal links.\nCopyrighted Flickr images:"}

Auditor-General, Kevin Brady ruled that $1.17 million of taxpayers' money had been spent unlawfully on electioneering.\nThere have been a numerous amount of questions on the Libertarianz auction, mostly humorous, including: \"Do I earn FlyBuys when I use the card?\" with the response: \"No. Labour doesn't need to earn your loyalty. Your loyalty is demanded.\"\nThere is also a 1936 autographed book which includes the signatures from the MP's of Labour's first government, a deck of Labour party cards said to be from the 1980s or a sport jacked branded Labour, described as \"old-skool style meets new-skool textile technology.\""}

The current border conflict between Eritrea and Ethiopia started in 1998, and ended in 2000 with a peace deal that stated the countries were bound to the decision of an independent commission ruling on the border issue.

Some are quoting a Law Commission report that says lethal injection is the most painless way of ending a condemned person's life. A former member of the Law Commission, N M Ghatate said Hanging is one of the cruelest ways of putting a man to death because he gets strangulated and his eyes pop out. There are many other gory details and he has to be prepared for the punishment.\nAfzal's lawyer Gavin Fernandes however rejected the lethal injection idea stating Lethal injection has been held to be cruel, inhuman and degrading. This goes to show that whenever you take a life, whether it is by hanging or by lethal injection, it causes enormous pain\nIndian law allows for the death penalty to be awarded for serious offences, albeit in the \"rarest of rare\" cases. Hanging has traditionally been used as a method of execution, and the other option (that of having the condemned face a firing squad) has seldom been exercised. Those against hanging however claim it is more cruel than lethal injection. Studies have however shown that the paralytic agent in the lethal injection may give the appearance that the condemned individual is \"calm\" due to the fact that he/she is unable to express his/her pain externally."}

Because it is constructed of inert materials and is operated pneumatically rather than electronically, the micro-hand can operate in air or water, giving it the ability to grasp small biological samples which tend to be moist or submersed in a liquid environment.\nLu and Kim presented their robotic hand in the article \"Microhand for biological applications\", published October 16 in the American Institute of Physics journal \"Applied Physics Letters\"."}

{"id": "52881", "revid": "14511", "url": "https://en.wikinews.org/wiki?curid=52881", "title": "US declares vital interest in space", "text": "President Bush has declared space to be essential to US defense in a new National Space Policy document published on September 14. Not only has the United States declared that it has rights in space, but also said it will \"deny, if necessary, adversaries the use of space capabilities hostile to U. S. national interests\". The policy states that presence in space takes its place alongside sea and air power in the defense of the country. The US has announced officially that it is using space for surveillance and monitoring activities, including observing natural disasters on Earth, and it intends to develop the commercial potential of space.\nThe new policy was agreed upon in August but the document was not released until October. In September, the BBC reported that the US Missile Defense Agency had announced the successful test firing of an interceptor missile from California which hit a target missile launched from Alaska. This followed the test firing of ballistic missiles by North Korea in July.\nThe success of this US interceptor missile launch is the fifth out of eight attempts and the first to use the facilities at the Vandenberg base. In the last two attempts, in December 2004 and February 2005, the interceptor missiles failed to take off. This whole program is reported to have cost $100 billion since 1983. The system employs radar and satellites to locate the target missile and to direct the interceptor towards it. The programme is not without its critics.\nReactions to the policy.\nThe BBC reports Tony Snow, White House spokesman as saying, in response to questions about the militarisation of space, \"The notion that you would do defense from space is different from that of weaponisation of space. We're comfortable with the policy\". \nTheresa Hitchens, director of the Centre for Defense Information, has a different opinion from Mr. Snow. She said; \"While this policy does not explicitly say we are not going to shoot satellites or we are going to put weapons in space, it does, it seems to me, open the door towards that. This is a much more unilateralist vision of space. The United States in this policy seeks to establish its rights but fails to acknowledge the rights of other countries in space, where the Clinton policy was very careful to acknowledge the rights of all nations in space.\" Hitchens said\nMarine Corps General Cartwright, interviewed by \"Inside Pentagon\", 18 October, was asked about allegations that China had tested the means of destroying American satellites, said \"...we really haven't seen that\". He likened the US role as that of enforcing the rule of the road in space. He pointed out that 16 or more countries can operate 10 or more satellites and that seven of these countries, China, Russia, India, South Korea, Indonesia, Brazil and Japan, are not members of NATO. He said that, \"unfortunately, we anticipate some will challenge the free use of space.\"\nMikhail Margelov, Chairman of the Russian Federation Council's foreign affairs committee, is reported by RBC News as saying that the new policy \"\"... may instigate Russian and joint Russian-US space exploration projects\". Russia and America had been cooperating in space for years and it was not in the interest of the USA to sever those relations\". \nHaving reported the new policy, the Taipei Times recollects that \"\"Before becoming Bush's secretary of defense, Donald Rumsfeld had warned against a \"Space Pearl Harbor\" and insisted US interests needed to be better protected\"\".\nUnder the headline \"America wants it all - life, the Universe and everything\", Bronwen Maddox in \"The Times\" describes the new space policy as \"comically proprietory in tone\" and reports that America has rejected talks proposals by 160 other states for a ban on an arms race in space - (the vote in the UN was 160-1). The project is described as having a \"breathtaking cost\". The policy does, however, highlight the vulnerability of military, commercial and personal data links that use satellites in space.\nThe difference between this policy and that of the President Clinton is highlighted in \"DefenseTech.org\" by the headline \"Bush: Space is for Soldiers\". It is pointed out that in the previous space policy the emphasis was on international security and cooperation, the new policy includes the following: \"Proposed arms control agreements or restrictions must not impair the rights of the United States to conduce research, development, testing and operations or other activities in space for U.S. national interests\"."}

Official reports stipulate that terrorists, under the guise of fishermen in 5 boats entered the harbor and detonated after ramming into gunboats anchored at the naval base. Initial reports confirm that at least 16 people were killed and scores of others were injured in the blast.\nThe government has accused the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, LTTE, a militant separatist group, banned as a terrorist organisation in countries such as United States, England, India and Australia of conducting both attacks. Though the organization has not claimed responsibility for either, they are also yet to claim responsibility in a string of such attacks, including the assassination of the Indian Prime Minister, Rajiv Gandhi, allegedly as retribution for \"war-crimes\" committed by the Indian Peace Keeping Force in Sri Lanka.\nAnalysts believe that the attack on the port city of Galle, a UNESCO heritage site and the heart of Sri Lanka's tourist industry was aimed at sparking a government response in the lead up to talks between the government and the LTTE, as well serving an economic blow in the lead up to peak tourist season on the island.\nThe presence of envoys from the U.S., Japan and Norway are expected for this week's scheduled government talks with the LTTE.

{"id": "52992", "revid": "14511", "url": "https://en.wikinews.org/wiki?curid=52992", "title": "Evangelist Kent Hovind's tax trial begins", "text": "Evangelist Kent Hovind and his wife, Jo, are trying to convince a federal jury that their money from video and amusement park admission sales belong to God and cannot be taxed. The trial began at United States District Court for the Northern District of Florida on Tuesday October 18, 2006 after twelve jury members and two alternates were selected to decide on the 58 federal courts against Hovind and his wife. The trial was expected to take at least two weeks to complete with the prosecution hoping to rest its case Tuesday, but a defense attorney became ill and the Judge delayed the trial until October 30th.\nHovind is a Young Earth creationist who does many speaking engagements and debates. He also sells videos giving a pro-creationism perspective, which he receives income for. Hovind, who calls himself \"Dr. Dino\", received a Ph.D in \"Christian education\" from the unaccredited correspondence school Patriot Bible University in 1991. \nCharges.\nProsecutor Michelle Heldmeyer said from 1999 to March 2004, the Hovinds took in more than $5 million. Heldmeyer charged Hovind on 12 counts for failing to pay about $470,000 in federal income, Social Security and Medicare taxes for his ministry employees between March 31, 2001, and Jan. 31, 2004. Counts 13 through 57 include Hovind's wife for making 45 transactions in a little more than a year, sometimes taking out as much as $9,500 at a time. Banks are required to report cash withdrawals that exceed $10,000.\nIn count 58 against Kent includes filing a frivolous lawsuit against the IRS, demanding damages for criminal trespass, filing an injunction against an IRS agent, making threats against investigators and those cooperating with the investigation, and filing false complaints against the IRS for false arrest, excessive use of force and theft.\nIn July with his attorney, Public Defender Kafahni Nkrumah, Hovind stated that he did not recognize the government's right to try him on tax-fraud charges.\nThis is not the first time Hovind has found himself in legal trouble. In 2002 he refused to get a $50.00 building permit for his Dinosaur Adventure Land, and after three years of legal battles the court ruled that he get a permit or the building would be razed. The park, which depicts dinosaurs as coexisting with humans in the last 6-4,000 years with the more recent \"dinosaurs\" being the Loch Ness monster, is reportedly open after Hovind paid for the permit and fines totaling $10,402.64.\nGovernment witnesses.\nMore directly, M.C. Powe, an IRS officer who investigates people who have unpaid tax returns or unpaid tax liabilities, testified at Hovind's current trial on October, 19, 2006 that she first attempted to collect taxes from the Hovinds in 1996. She noted Hovind tried several \"bullying tactics\" that included suing her at least three times. These resulted in each case being thrown out.\nAssistant U.S. Attorney Benjamin Beard handled Hovind's bankruptcy in 1996 testified on Wednesday that in 1996 after Hovind's vehicles were seized by the IRS, he filed under the Chapter 13 \"wage-earner plan,\" available only to those who have a regular source of income. However, Hovind wrote that he had no form of income, that he rejected his Social Security number and that his employer was God, Beard testified.\nIn a 2005 affidavit, the Hovinds argue that Social Security is essentially a \"Ponzi scheme.\" The Hovinds referred to the United States Government as \"the 'bankrupt' corporate government\" and said they were renouncing their United States citizenship and Social Security numbers to become \"a natural citizen of 'America' and a natural sojourner.\"\nOn Thursday an employee of AmSouth Bank explained that the Currency Transaction Reports requires the bank to report any time a cash amount of $10,000 or more is withdrawn or deposited. This employee noted that various records demonstreated Jo Hovind had made transactions up to $15,000 at a time. \nAlso on Thursday Hovind's former neighbor testified regarding Hovind's purchasing of her Palafox Street home. On the stand she said Hovind paid her $30,000 in cash as part of the $155,000 sale.\nHovind's employees.\nIn this week's trial two of Hovind's workers testified in federal court that they didn't consider where they worked to be a church. In court Hovind maintains he does not have to pay the taxes because his employees were \"volunteers,\" \"missionaries\" or \"ministers\" and his business was a ministry.\nHowever, Brian Popp, Hovind's employee for at least eight years, said he considered himself a minister at the time of his employment, but said Hovind's ministry isn't a church. Popp also testified that Hovind knew about the bank's requirement to report transactions over $10,000 and said it was \"not safe to carry large sums of cash.\"\nFurther, Popp said Hovind told his workers not to accept mail addressed to \"KENT HOVIND\" because Hovind told the workers the government created a corporation in his \"all-caps name\" and if the mail was accepted, Hovind claimed, it would be accepting the responsibilities associated with that corporation.\nDiane P. Cooksey, served as a sales representative for the ministry from January 2003 to June 2005, and said Hovind expected to pay her own taxes. Cooksey said, \"He explained what his belief was, right up front in the interview, that I would pay my own taxes.\" As told's worker, she received $10 an hour in a weekly paycheck, punched a time clock, was given 10 paid vacation days a year, and considered herself an employee, not a missionary as a few others called themselves.\nThe IRS raided Hovind's Dinosaur Adventure Land in April 2004, after which Hovind required his employees to sign nondisclosure agreements. \"I was uncomfortable signing it, I guess, because of not having a full understanding,\" Cooksey said.\nPensacola Christian College.\nRebekah Horton, vice president of the unaccredited Pensacola Christian College, took the stand on the second day of the trial and testified that \"We know the Scriptures do not promote (tax evasion)\". \"It's against Scripture teaching.\"\nHorton was given a videotape in the mid 1990s from a woman who worked for Hovind. The video contained \"another evangelist advocating tax evasion,\" Horton explained. The woman who gave the tape to Horton claimed Hovind's philosophy as \"You were giving a gift with your work, and they were giving a gift back to you.\" \nPensacola Christian College decided to disallow its students from working with Hovind's Creation Science Evangelism and reported Hovind's scheme to the IRS.\nIRS and 'beating the system'.\nOn Friday, attorney David Charles Gibbs testified that Hovind claimed he had no obligation to pay employee income taxes and explained with \"a great deal of bravado\" how he had \"beat the tax system.\" Gibbs is an attorney with the Gibbs Law Firm, also is affiliated with the Christian Law Association, a nonprofit organization founded by his father that offers free legal help to churches nationwide in a suburb of St. Petersburg, Florida. Gibbs attended the Marcus Pointe Baptist Church when Hovind was a guest speaker at the church on October 17, 2004. Hovind invited Gibbs and others to Hovind's home for pizza and soda.\nGibbs testified they talked for many hours, and Hovind \"tried to stress to me that he was like the pope and this was like the Vatican.\" Also Gibbs explained Hovind also told him he preferred to deal in cash because \"dealing with cash there is no way to trace it, so it wasn't taxable.\"\nLater on Friday, Special IRS Agent Scott Schneider took up the remainder of the day and is expected to resume Monday. Schneider told the jury his investigation revealed that Hovind \"hadn't filed tax returns ever, to my knowledge.\"\nHovind tried suing the IRS and Schneider several times to avoid providing information required by the IRS. Each filing was thrown out by the judges.\nSchneider's discussed documents seized during the 2004 raid of Hovind's property. These documents, Schneider explained, indicated Hovind ran his ministry as a business with \"meticulous\" payroll documents and a time clock employees had to punch in and out.\nIn the raid cash was found \"all over the place.\" Ultimately, $42,000 in cash was seized along with half-dozen guns (including a SKS semiautomatic) at the Hovinds' home.\nThe Pensacola News Journal noted that \"in one memo, Jo Hovind informed her daughter, who works at the park, that her pay would be docked $10 for talking too long on the telephone when she should have been working.\""}

(EDT), the estimated population of the United States crossed the 300 million mark.\nThe United States population reached the 100 million mark in 1915 and the 200 million mark 52 years later in 1967. Only 39 years later, it has touched 300 million.\nIn 1967, when the population reached 200 million, President Lyndon Johnson held a news conference at the Commerce Department to \"hail America's past and to talk about the challenges ahead\".\nWhile the current administration doesn't appear to have similar public celebrations for the 300 million mark as President Johnson had for the 200 million mark, Commerce Secretary Carlos Gutierrez said to the Associated Press \"I would hate to think that we are going to be low key about this...I would hope that we make a big deal about it.\"\nDuring the year the population reached 200 million, David E. Lilienthal, the former chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission, grimly predicted that 300 million people would cause the country to be impoverished and polluted with scarce national resources. \"A population of at least 300 million by 2000 will, I now believe, threaten the very quality of life of individual Americans.\"\nSam Roberts of \"The New York Times\" notes that while the United States' population is growing by slightly less than 1 percent per year, the nation is the third largest in population behind China and India, each with populations over 1 billion. The United States continues to be gaining people while many other industrialized nations are not; Japan's population is actually decreasing.\nIn terms of regional distribution, there has also been major change. Between 1970 and 2000, the portion of population in the southern and western United States went from 48 percent to 58 percent. The Population Reference Bureau also notes a rise in suburbia in the 30 year gap. While the percentage of the population living in cities remained around 30 percent, the percentage of people living in the suburbs rose from 38 percent to 50 percent.\nJohn McCormick discussed in \"Chicago Tribune\" how the make-up of the US population has certainly changed from 1967 to today. Then, Italy was the country where most foreign born people came from more than any other; in 2006 that nation is Mexico. And in the 39 year span, the percentage of foreign-born U.S. citizens has more than doubled from 5 percent to 12 percent today. According to the Population Reference Bureau, almost 50 percent of Americans under 5 years of age are members of a minority, be it racial or ethnic.\nThe U.S. Bureau of the Census maintains a current estimated U.S. population count on its website."}

Those in favour of the proposal, however, say that this concept will start a revolution and empower rural India.\nColumnist, author and visiting professor at Centre for Policy Research, B G Verghese says, \"This operates at the grassroot level and once people can have access to this kind of information, you can put across anything to them, whether it is education or health.

Games such as \"World of Warcraft\" and \"Second Life\" have large player driven economic systems in which - either following the rules or against them - real world currencies are exchanged for in-game currencies. With the GDP of some of these economies rivaling that of some small countries, the US government is wondering if it is missing out on a potential source of tax revenue: or as some gamers might put it, the IRS is asking \"You buy gold?\".\nIn cases where exchange of a real world currency for in-game currency is permitted by the rules of the game, some of these online games such as \"Second Life\" require that players report any income generated by these means to his or her government. In most on-line games however, a black market exists where players buy and sell in-game currencies in direct violation of the game's rules; situations involving black markets are notoriously hard to tax.\nCompounding the issue of currency exchange is the existence of in-game assets. In the real world if someone wins a luxury vehicle, he or she is expected to pay a capital gains tax on his or her winnings. If a 40 person \"raid\" in \"World of Warcraft\" gets a rare \"drop,\" worth up to thousands of dollars if sold illegally, should they be required to pay a capital gains tax?\nEven if the issue of capital gains is ignored, there is still the matter of sales tax. In many of these games, non-player characters and players alike sell items to one another. If sales tax is to be applied, at what rate should it be charged and to what State does it go? Questions such as these have just recently been answered in much less hazy situations such as online versions of brick and mortar establishments.\nDan Miller, senior economist for the Joint Economic Committee had this to say on the issue, \"I found that talking about this issue with some of the other economists on the committee, they are not really familiar with what a virtual economy is. The idea of \"Second Life\" or \"World of Warcraft\" or some of these other synthetic universes, they have trouble wrapping their head around it. So there's an educational hurdle to overcome here.\" \nThe preliminary findings of the committee state that virtual economies deserve clarification of existing tax laws, not new taxes."}

This is his second Grand Prix victory. Massa became the first Brazilian to win on home soil since Ayrton Senna in 1993. Massa started from pole and controlled the race from start to the finish line.\nFernando Alonso finished second to win the drivers' championship. He became the youngest second-time champion. Alonso, along with the second Renault driver, Giancarlo Fisichella who finished sixth, won the constructors' cup for their team with only five points ahead of Ferrari. Jenson Button, one of Honda's drivers, finished behind Alonso.\nMichael Schumacher had a few problems this weekend. In the beginning of the third qualification session his car slowed down and forced him to start 10th on Sunday. In the race he was almost on the back of Fisichella, but damaged his tyre in the overtaking attempt and lose all positions. But the retiring champion was right on the back of Fisico for the second time near the end of the race. Giancarlo made a crucial mistake prior to Senna's \"S\"-curve allowing Michael to pass him. Next aim was Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen, from McLaren-Mercedes, who lost his place to Schumacher in the same turn. Must note that all Schumacher overtook most of the other drivers in the same turn. The \"Red Baron\" set up the fastest time and the top speed record for this track. Let's say the words Nick Heidfeld, Sauber-BMW team driver, wrote on the back of his aerodynamical spoiler - \"Danke, Michael!\". Danke, Michael, for the fantastic race and so many seasons together. You overcomed the difficulties as the true champion.\nKimi and Giancarlo finished 5-th and 6-th respectively.\nRubens Barrichello (Honda, Pedro de la Rosa (McLaren-Mercedes) and Poland Robert Kubica (Sauber-BMW)\nwere 7-th, 8-th and 9-th respectfully. Takuma Sato closed the season with 10-th place, first who finished in one lap after the winner, the best result for Super Aguri-Honda team.\nWith ten laps to go, the most surprising event was Kimi's resistance when his open wheels untimely overlapped with Michael's, especially when one knows Kimi will run with Ferrari next season."}

There has been an overall decline of around 30 per cent over the 33-year period. Tropical species populations declined by around 55 per cent on average from 1970 to 2003, while temperate species populations, have shown little overall change. \nThe Ecological Footprint measures the area of biologically productive land and sea required to sustian humanity. In 2003 this was 14.1 billion global hectares, or 2.2 global hectares per person (a global hectare is a hectare with world-average ability to produce resources and absorb wastes). The total supply of productive area, or biocapacity, in 2003 was 11.2 global hectares, or 1.8 global hectares per person. Demand overshot supply first in the 1980s and has been increasing every year since, By 2003 the overshoot was about 25 per cent. Thus, it took approximately a year and three months for the Earth to produce the ecological resources humanity used in that year. \nThe Living Planet Index and the Ecological Footprint, along with other measures, have been adopted as indicators for the 2010 targets of the Convention on Biological Diversity. \nThe report concludes with a description of the roles of the various disciplines required to \"shift humanity's current trajectory on to a path that will remain within the biological capacity of the planet\".\nJames P.

Facing an appeal before the United States Anti-Doping Agency next year, Landis dubbed this approach \"the Wikipedia defense\".\nLandis said on October 12, 2006 that he had published a number of documents in the case \"to support his innocence in the alleged positive doping test\". These included his attorney's motion for dismissal, a document package containing test information, and a PowerPoint presentation criticizing the test. This action earned considerable but sometimes-skeptical media coverage in the ongoing saga over the disputed race.\nLandis did not set up an actual wiki, but attempted to draw on the collective resources of cycling fans, using the Internet to allow widely distributed review of evidence in his case. He succeeded in getting the community to establish its own wiki independent of him personally, based largely on the Daily Peloton Forum discussions noted below. The topic had already drawn intense interest in a variety of places, including Landis's Wikipedia entry, which has figured as something of a battleground. The release serves as both a public relations strategy and a way to potentially strengthen his appeal. As Landis put it, \"Why turn down free brainpower?\"\nIn anticipation of the release of these documents, Landis had been personally posting on the forums at the Daily Peloton cycling website. He is largely out of action while rehabilitating from hip resurfacing surgery performed in September. As the documents were about to be released, Landis said, \"I am sure you guys will find every mistake, even things we haven't noticed.\"\nIn forum discussions, Landis agreed with sympathetic posters who pointed to this as a \"wisdom of crowds\" approach, while asking others not to judge him based on incomplete information from media reports. He encouraged people to look at all of the evidence, saying, \"We'll call it the Wikipedia defense, and I would have given everything to you sooner but had a very hard time selling the idea to the lawyers.\" At the same time, he said that not all of his arguments against the test had been revealed: \"We are not going to compromise our defense by telling all of it.\""}

As partners in the development project, the OHA owns the land, and the developers own the buildings.\nAs a result of the OHA approval, local nonprofit housing developer EBALDC and Related Companies, LLC., out of New York City, created Creekside Housing Partners, L.P., to take control of Oakland's public housing property at the Coliseum Gardens site.\nAfter the eviction of 178 families and the demolition of their 178 public housing units during 2004, Creekside Housing Partners (CHP) moved as quickly as possible to rebuild and finish off \"phase 1,\" of their project. Phase 1 of the development is managed by Related Companies, the tenants pay their rents to the New York based firm, and during the past 6 months the developers have moved people into 115 newly rebuilt housing units at the development.\nTwima Early works at the management office of Related Companies located at Lion Creek Crossings and was eager to help shed some light on whats been going on at the newly privatized public housing site in East Oakland. \nIn an October 18 interview, Twima Early said, \"During the past 6 months, we have completed phase 1 of our project and moved people into 115 housing units at our new development. Out of the 178 families who were originally displaced by our project, the OHA sent us a list of 13 families who were eligible to move back into this location, and only 4 of those families actually moved into our new development.\" \n\"It seemed odd that the Housing Authority would only allow 13 families to move back into this location, and I can't explain why so few were allowed to return,\" said Early. \nWhen Randy Shaw of the Tenderloin Housing Clinic learned how few of the original public housing tenants that were actually allowed to move back into the Coliseum Gardens/Lion Creek housing development, he said, \"The Hope VI program has once again proved to be the major cause of the displacement of low-income people. I've never heard of numbers so skewed before in regards to the displacement of families who were promised that the Hope VI project would be beneficial to them.\"\nSince 1994, Oakland officials and the Federal Government have targeted Oakland's poor with nearly $84 million in federal funding through the Hope VI program.\nThe privatization of Oakland's public housing units have been occurring at a rapid pace. When wealthy billionaire Stephen M. Ross, CEO of Related Companies, teamed up with local nonprofit housing developer EBALDC to re-develop the Coliseum Gardens/Lion Creek housing complex, it became apparent that the developers made out much better than the displaced families did. \nCarlos Castellanos of EBALDC is involved in the Coliseum Gardens/Lion Creek development, and when I asked how did this project benefit the families who used to reside there or how is the City of Oakland benefitting from the displacement of so many families, Castellanos said, \"These are loaded questions and not something that I want to talk about. I think that a lot of those tenants did not really want to move back, and I think that you really need to talk to the Housing Authority to find out what happened to all of those families.\" \nVivian Haine resided in a public housing unit near the Coliseum Gardens site, and said, \"About a year ago, Kim Boyd the site manager where I resided at, told me that I'm lucky to be living here even if there is no money for repairs at this building, because they didn't have enough funding to finish off the project at Coliseum Gardens, and most of the evicted tenants had no where to go. I believe that many of the families displaced from the Coliseum Gardens development couldn't find any housing to move into and may have become homeless,\" Haine said. \nRecords show that on June 24, 2006, the OHA's Board of Commissioners approved the use of market rate rents in its Project-Based Section 8 program at the Coliseum Gardens/Lion Creek development, to cover a $600,000 funding shortfall after the EBALDC/Related Companies claimed that they needed more money to complete phase 3 of the project. \nA Sept. 19, 2006, OHA memo mentions that EBALDC/Related Companies are co-developing the rental portion at Coliseum Gardens/Lion Creek Crossings site, which will include 157 units of public housing. The total number of rental units, including public housing, now planned is approximately 440 units, plus another 28 units of for-sale housing which are planned to be developed by Chambers Construction Company. \nWith the demolition of 178 public housing units by the developers, and only 157 public housing units being rebuilt at the Coliseum Gardens/Lion Creek Crossings housing site, theres been a net loss of 21 public housing units at this location.\nThe OHA and City of Oakland continue to funnel millions of dollars to the EBALDC/Related Companies partnership, in an effort to privatize part of Oakland's public housing program in East Oakland.\nSince its inception, the Hope VI program has resulted in the demolition of more than 120,000 public housing units across the nation, only to be replaced by 40,000 mixed income units, and less than 12% of the displaced families have managed to gain entry back into the locations they were originally evicted from.

He said that \n\"Soldiers are obliged to protect the national security, safeguard the nation, and uphold loyalty to the monarchy. The military cannot tolerate any leaders who lack or have limited loyalty to the king...\"\nInsulting the 78-year-old monarch, who has spent 60 years on the throne, is considered a very serious crime in Thailand.\nThe general has admitted that the military could lose public support if no evidence is found to support the accusations.\nMr. Shinawatra is currently living in exile in London."}

The new results show if the tiny objects are rods, their actions are markedly different from the type of Brownian motion previously known.\nThe research was published in the Journal \"Science\" this week and is direct proof of the behavior. Brownian motion has also been used as a model to predict random behavior, such as the stock market. \"It is such a profound and fundamental phenomenon that, as a physicist, I want to learn everything about [Brownian motion],\" said Arjun Yodh, Physics professor at the University of Pennsylvania. \nEinstein first described Brownian motion in a paper in 1906, but only concentrated on the movement of little balls. He concluded that if a small ball, like a dust particle or equivalent in water, spun, that action didn't affect where the ball traveled. It turned out that its location could be predicted with statistics. The University of Pennsylvania scientists took this further and photographed teeny plastic rods moving in water instead. Using a charge coupled device, or CCD camera, they took millions of pictures at a time, making a sort of movie of the motion. This way they could analyze the motion more directly. They found that the path of a spinning rod is directly related to its spin. \nPost-doc Yilong Han explained this by saying, \"since ellipsoids are longer than they are wide, they experience more water resistance going in one direction than the other... It gives rise to the weird behavior we observed.\"\nIn terms of the practicality of the experiments, team physicist Tom Lubensky stated that the research was directed at obtaining fundamental understanding of a \"ubiquitous and important phenomenon.\" It is not clear yet what practical applications this research will lead to. But it may help with understanding the mechanisms in cells, because proteins in living cells undergo Brownian motion in response to bumps by smaller molecules.\nAfter discovering the strange movement, the lab rediscovered the work done by the French physicist Francis Perrin in the 1930s, predicting the exact motion the researchers had observed. \"One of the exciting aspects of this work is the precise agreement between a relatively simple theory and experiments,\" said Tom Lubensky, Penn's chair of the physics department."}

The voting has been largely peaceful, though isolated incidents of violence and voting fraud have been reported.\nPolling day.\nVoting was largely peaceful, with isolated incidents of violence in the \nnorth-east. Two people were reported killed amidst protests over alleged irregularities in polling. Turnout is expected to be lower than in the last round. \nThunderstorms and a five-hour spell of rain dampened early morning \nvoting in the western Bas Congo province and the capital Kinshasa. \nBemba supporters protested against alleged ballot-stuffing in Lisala, \nand looted polling stations and burnt ballot boxes in Bumba. Two people \nwere reported killed and four others injured when \"naval forces\" and \npolice fired on the protesters. \nA Human Rights Watch observer estimated that between 15 to 25 thousand people were prevented from voting by Congolese army troops, who blockaded roads and demanded money from voters going to the polls, in the north-eastern Ituri district. \nPolling was open between 6:00 a.m. local time and 5:00 p.m. (0500 GMT to\n1600 GMT) in the west, and one hour earlier in the east. Polling was \nextended beyond the closing time in some areas.\n80,000 police personnel and 17,000 U.N. peace-keepers backed by 2,000 E.U. troops were deployed to secure the polling. The peace-keepers staged \n\"flag-marches\" in Kinshasa and other cities.\nOver 1,000 international and 40,000 Congolese observers monitored the \nelections in the 50,045 polling stations. Counting is to begin \nimmediately, but provisional results are not expected before November \n19. \nKinshasa was reported as \"tense\", with over 5,000 armed supporters of \nKabila and 600 fighters loyal to Bemba reportedly present in the \ncapital. Both Kabila and Bemba voted in Kinshasa, but did not speak to \nreporters. A joint statement issued by their parties called for people \nto vote \"in a calm, orderly and peaceful manner\".\nTransition from war.\nMineral rich Congo has remained largely undeveloped, despite possessing \nrich reserves of gold, diamonds, coltan and Uranium. \nFollowing independence from Belgium, Congo underwent a turbulent political history, enduring a 32-year dictatorship under Mobutu Sese Seko. The 1994 Rwandan genocide sparked strife in neighbouring Congo, and Sese Seko was overthrown by Laurent Kabila in the First Congo War. \nKabila was challenged by Rwanda and Uganda backed rebels, but drew on support from troops from Zimbabwe, Angola, Namibia, Chad, and Sudan. The resulting Second Congo War, the deadliest conflict since the Second World War, killed an estimated four million people and displaced another five million.\nA peace accord was signed in 2002 and a transitional government set up, with Joseph Kabila as President and two of the rebel leaders, including Bemba as Vice Presidents. A new constitution was approved by referendum held in February this year and the first multi-party elections began on July 30, 2006.\nA UN peace-keeping force, MUNOC has been deployed in Congo since 2000 and was charged with keeping security during the elections. The elections, funded by $460 million of international aid, are conducted by the Independent Electoral Commission.\nKabila has won the support of third and fourth placed candidates, Antoine Gizenga and Nzanga Mobutu - the son of Mobutu Sese Seko, following the first round of elections. Clashes between Kabila and Bemba supporters have left at least 23 people dead, following the announcement of the results of the last round of elections."}

Commissioned by the British Government and prepared by Sir Nicholas Stern, former top economist at the World Bank, it forecasts that, if action is not taken now, the world will suffer an economic disaster on an unprecedented scale. 100 million people will be refugees from floods caused by rising water levels, drought caused by the melting of glaciers will affect 1 in 6 of the world's population, up to 40% of present wildlife species will become extinct and the world economy will shrink by 20%.\nSir Nicholas claims that these forecasts are based on the best available scientific evidence about the extent and effects of climate change. He does not claim absolute certainty, only a high degree of probability that the world is facing economic catastrophe if action is not taken immediately. An expenditure of just 1% of the world's wealth now could avert it. Spending \u00a31 now could save \u00a35, or even more, in the future. \nThe effects of global warming can be contained, says the Review, if about 1% of the world's GDP is invested in reducing the emissions of greenhouse gases. This investment must take place over the next 10 to 20 years otherwise the effects of climate change could be disastrous on a scale comparable to the great wars and the slump of the first half of the last century. There has to be action at national, regional and international levels. \nThe Review concludes that the actions to be taken include emissions trading, doubling investment in research and development of low carbon energy sources, curbing deforestation and supporting adaptation in poorer countries by developing crops appropriate to the changed climatic conditions.\nThe Stern Review shows that the scientific evidence for global warming is \"overwhelming\", said Prime Minister Blair. Chancellor Gordon Brown said that Britain will take the lead in persuading the world of the seriousness of the problem. All the major political parties in Britain have been discussing climate change.\nThe Review is attracting a great deal of media attention. Salient among the views being reported are those of a number of experts including the following:\nProfessor Bill Mcguire, Benfield UCL Hazard Research Centre who says that Stern has greatly underestimated the effects of global warming. \nMartin Livermore, The Scientific Alliance asserts that \"climate is not driven primarily by human use of fossil fuels\" and that the money to be spent is unlikely to have much effect: it would be better spent on the world's poor. \nPia Hansen, European Commission Spokeswoman says doing nothing is not an option, we must act now.\nSimon Retallack, UK Think Tank IPPR - this (Review) removes the last refuge of the \"do-nothing\" approach on climate change, particularly in the US.\nTom Delay, The Carbon Trust - The Review offers a huge business opportunity.\nRichard Lambert,CBI Director Genera says that a global system of carbon trading is urgently needed.\nCharlie Kronick, Greenpeace - now the government must act and, among other things, invest in efficient decentralised power stations and tackle the growth of aviation.\nConcurrently with the publication of the Stern Review, the United Nations reports that emissions from the industrialsed world are still rising. There has been a 2.4% increase in emissions across 41 industrialised countries in the first four years of this century. Britain, France and Germany are near to achieving their Kyoto Protocol targets, but the US is the biggest polluter and its emissions have been increasing.\nThe Kyoto Protocol calls for a reduction of 5% of pollutants below 1990 levels. There has been a reduction of 3.3% since then but this has been the result of the collapse of industry in Eastern Europe which has counterbalanced the increases in the rich countries. The Stern Review suggests that the Kyoto targets are too modest."}

On Sunday, Mexican police forces clothed in riot gear, armed with tear gas and assault rifles, and backed up by armoured vehicles took up positions on the edge of the city to begin their march into the city centre.\nA male protester manning one barricade was killed as federal police stormed the city, Police did not immediately confirm that. \nBut it is still uncertain whether more than one million schoolchildren would return to classes Monday in the embattled city where riot police and burned-out vehicles still line the streets.\nOaxaca suffers from a stand-off between the state government of Oaxaca and the People's Popular Assembly of Oaxaca (APPO), a consortium of groups including teachers, farmers, and other workers. The impetus for federal involvement in Oaxaca appears to stem from the murder of four protesters and wounding of at least one other by state-sanctioned paramilitaries on Friday the 28th. Also potentially contributing to federal interdiction could be a desire, formed following the protests in Mexico City after the country's recent elections, to forge stronger ties between Vicente Fox's National Action Party (PAN) and the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI).\nThe protests began in May as a teacher's strike. Police and state forces - often in plain-clothes - have shot at protesters, setting off clashes in which at least eight people have died. \nIt is still too early to tell when federal police will withdraw from Oaxaca City. Protesters have decided to abandon the centre and regroup at a local university. The protesters accuse Ruiz of corruption and rigging elections. Daniel Reyes a teacher, told reporters \"We are going to leave this area . . . while we regroup and look at strategies to recover this area,\" leaving open the possibility of continued protests, extended federal occupation, and ongoing violence."}

The institution of global carbon trading, control of deforestation, increased investment in energy R &amp; D and support to poorer countries in adapting to climate change are all key proposals in the Review. \nA leaked letter from David Miliband, Environment Secretary, to Chancellor Brown contains a package of tax proposals to promote the use of public transport and to encourage people to buy smaller cars and fly less. The proposals also include charges on petrol-guzzling cars, road pricing, levies on air travel and increased charges for landfill waste disposal.\nThe findings of the Review and the promise of a Government Climate Bill, containing measures in response to the Review, received a mixed reception from employers and unions.\nMiles Templeman, Director-General of the Institute of Directors, said: \"Without countries like the US, China or India making decisive commitments, UK competitiveness will undoubtedly suffer if we act alone. This would be bad for business, bad for the economy and ultimately bad for our climate.\"\nThe Confederation of British Industries, the British Chambers of Commerce and asset managers F&amp;C all pointed out the dangers to business of additional taxation. \nBrendan Barber, General Secretary of the Trades Union Congress, was optimistic about the opportunities for industry to meet demands created by investment in technology to combat climate change. The Prince of Wales' Corporate Leaders Group on Climate Change, formed by 14 of UK's leading companies shared this hope. Chairman of Shell UK, James Smith, expressed the hope of the group that business and Government would discuss how Britain could obtain \"first mover advantage\" in what he described as \"massive new global markets.\"\nThe markets for low-carbon energy products are expected to be worth \u00a3300 billion by 2050.\nNigel Farage, leader of the UK Independence Party, questions the assertions that there is scientific consensus on global warming. At best, he said, there is uncertainty. Politicians world-wide are jumping on the \u2018green' bandwagon, but, if they want popular support, they'd better be sure that this is not simply the \u2018new witchcraft'.\nRuth Lea, Director of the Centre for Policy Studies, also questions the notion that there is a \u2018scientific consensus' over global warming. She alleges that \"authorities on climate science say that the climate system is far too complex for modest reductions in one of the thousands of factors involved in climate change (i.e. carbon emissions) to have a predictable effect in magnitude, or even direction.\" About economic models, upon which Stern relied for his projections, her experience was that forecasting just two or three years ahead was usually wrong. She described the problem of drawing conclusions from combining scientific and economic models as \u2018monumentally complex'. She doubted whether international cooperation was really possible. She concluded that she thought that this Review was designed to cloak the motives of a government that wanted some moral justification for increasing taxation on fuels. \nAn unconfirmed report on BBC 24 early Tuesday morning, October 31, stated that the White House had not yet seen a copy of the Stern Review.\nIn response to the Stern Report Australia's Prime Minister John Howard promised a AU$60 million to fight climate change. The projects are part of the Asia-Pacific Partnership on Clean Development and Climate. \"The Asia-Pacific Partnership includes countries that represent about half of the world's emissions, energy use, GDP (gross domestic product) and population, and is an important initiative that engages, for the first time, the key greenhouse-gas emitting countries in the Asia-Pacific region,\" Mr Howard said in a statement.\nA statement by Australian Greens senators Rachel Siewert and Christine Milne criticised the saying \"ABARE indicated that the type of research undertaken for the Stern Report is beyond them. They can put a price on what ratifying the Kyoto protocol would cost but have no idea or capacity to put a price on the cost of not acting. They are tinkering around the edges of the problem and don't seem to know whether climate change is real or whether there is any urgency.\""}

Researchers looked at previously published studies on sexual behaviour in the last decade.\nProfessor Kaye Wellings, of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicines, and her colleagues analysed data on sexual behaviour in the last decade from 59 countries. \nThe report also shows no support for the common notion that there is a culture of multiple sexual partners in countries with poor sexual health. Multiple sexual partners, it turns out, are more common in industrialised than in developing nations.\nThe study also found that contrary to popular belief, sexual activity is not starting earlier. Nearly everywhere, men and women have their first sexual experiences in their late teens; from 15 to 19 years old \u2014 with generally younger ages for women than for men, especially in developing countries. \n\"A single woman is more able to negotiate safe sex in certain circumstances than a married woman,\" said Paul van Look, director of Reproductive Health and Research at the World Health Organisation, who was unconnected to the study and points out that \"married women in Africa and Asia are often threatened by unfaithful husbands who frequent prostitutes\".\nThere is much greater equality between women and men with regard to the number of sexual partners in rich countries than in poor countries, the study found. This imbalance has significant public health implications. Because of the diversity of sexual habits worldwide, Wellings warns that no single approach to sexual health will work everywhere. \"There are very different economic, religious and social rules governing sexual conduct across the world,\" Wellings said.\nFor example, men and women in Australia, Britain, France and the United States tend to have an almost equal number of sexual partners. In contrast, in Cameroon, Haiti, and Kenya, men tend to have multiple partners while women tend only to have one.\nAlong with other industrialised countries, Australia was one in which having two or more sexual partners in the past year was comparatively common. \nSingle men and women in Africa were fairly sexually inactive: only two-thirds of them reported recent sexual activity, compared with three-quarters of their counterparts in developed countries.\nIn what researchers said was proof the sexual double standard was still strong, more men than women reported having more than one partner. \n\"These findings beg the question of who the men are having sex with,\" they wrote.\nItaly had one of the lowest percentages of men who had sex before age 15 (4 per cent), compared to 18 per cent in the United States and 30 per cent in Brazil and the Dominican Republic. The researchers said early initiation was more likely to be non-consensual, unsafe and generally to be regretted later. \nThe study suggests that unequal treatment of girls and women as the major sexual-health issue.\nThe researchers call for providing sexual health services to unmarried young women, supplying condoms, decriminalizing commercial sex and homosexual sex, and prosecuting the perpetrators of sexual violence.\nExperts say data gleaned from the study will be useful not only in dispelling popular myths about sexual behaviour, but in shaping policies that will help improve sexual health across the world. \n\"There's a misperception that there's a great deal of promiscuity in Africa, which is one of the potential reasons for HIV/AIDS spreading so rapidly,\" said van Look\nFewer than half of unmarried non-virgins reported having sex in the past month. \nSome of the major findings the survey found were:"}

Another elephant also began to play with a painted \"white 'X'\" on its head when it walked in front of the mirror.\n\"They would go over smell it and then leave.

At least 95% of the birds Guan and his team looked at were infected with the new strain and vaccines formulated to fight the H5N1 virus have not worked.\n\"This novel variant may have become dominant ... because it was not as easily affected as other strains by the avian vaccine used to prevent H5 infection.

Additionally, the study was found to have been started and carried out for six months without\nethical committee approval, and suffered from other shortcomings.\nFindings.\nNumerous shortcomings were found in a study which according to documents signed by WHO Director-General candidate Pekka Puska, head of the Finnish National Public Health Institute (NPHI)\n\"complies with the law regarding medical research and good research\npractice. ... informed consent fulfills the requirements of the\nlaw. ... distribution of infant formula does not deviate from legal\nnorms.\"\nThe Finnish Parliamentary Ombudsman Riitta-Leena Paunio disagreed with\nprofessor Puska. On October 25, the 60th anniversary of the filing of the\nindictment in Doctors' Trial (of the Nuremberg Trials) which led to the framing of modern medical research ethics, she resolved a complaint filed by The Breastfeeding Support Association in Finland. According to the resolution, it was not possible for the parents to give informed consent as required by law due to many reasons.\nThe Ombudsman lists lack of disclosure of the study's funding, lack of\nclear statement pointing the benefits of breastfeeding, lack of\ndisclosure of the fact that the Principal Investigator working within\nNPHI is an inventor and benefactor in a patent on the research formula\nowned by the Finnish formula manufacturer Valio, as reasons for\nlack of capacity to give informed consent. The Ombudsman also\npoints out that during discovery of the facts concerning the study,\nNPHI gave information which was simply not true. Documents\ngiven during discovery by NPHI were signed by Pekka Puska, the Finnish\ncandidate for the post of WHO Director-General. NPHI also claimed in\nstatements signed by professor Puska to have accepted public funding\naddressed only directly to it, while in actual fact NPHI accepted\npublic funding addressed to Valio which Valio directed to NPHI.\nFurther omissions pointed out by the Ombudsman include lack of the\nnaming of the one single person responsible for the safety of the\nstudy as required by Finnish law and omissions in giving information\nand asking for consent and ethical approval when changes to the study\nwere made, and the omission of not asking for consent from both parents.\nAccording to the Parliamentary Ombudsman's resolution, both National\nPublic Health Institute and the ethical committee failed in fulfilling\ntheir duties. The Ombudsman reminds that according to the Finnish\nConstitution, everyone has the right to life, personal liberty, integrity and security.\nNo one shall be treated in a manner violating human dignity. Medical research\nhas a connection to this basic right. The Ombudsman also cites the Declaration of Helsinki and international conventions on human rights in her decision. During the discovery phase of the complaint, the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health\nstated that the Declaration of Helsinki, named after the Finnish capital, is not legally binding.\nThe aim of the study was to find out whether removal of bovine insulin\nfrom infant formula would reduce type 1 diabetes (IDDM) and find out\nmechanisms leading to IDDM, whose prevalence in Finland is more than\nin any other country in the world.\nComplaint.\nThe complaint, filed in April, 2004 by The Breastfeeding Support\nAssociation in Finland (founded 1997), asked the Ombudsman to find out\nthe legality of an infant formula product development study with\nnational health implications, funded by the Finnish infant formula\nmanufacturer Valio and carried out by the National Public Health\nInstitute of Finland.\nThe two major points in the complaint were to find out\n1) whether the study fulfills informed consent requirements, when\nparents are not told enough about the benefits of breastfeeding nor\nthe product development nature and commercial funding of the study \n2) whether it is legal to distibute infant formula provided by an infant\nformula manufacture free of charge from the hospital with means which\nresemble the milk nurse practice of some infant formula companies.\nThe Breastfeeding Support Association based the first part of the\ncomplaint on the law concerning medical research. The second part was\nbased on the part of International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk\nSubstitutes established in 1981 by the general assembly of the World\nHealth Organization (WHO) implemented in Finnish law and the United\nNations Convention on the Rights of the Child, (right to best possible\nhealth, advancement of breastfeeding).\nThe Breastfeeding Support Association pressed that they think the\nstudy's aims (both the product development goals and the scientific\ngoal of finding out whether dietary bovine insulin triggers the\nautoimmune reaction causing IDDM) are valid and important, but that\nresearch should be done according to laws, international conventions\nand ethical principles.\nReaction to the Ombudsman's decision.\nWhile the part of the complaint concerning informed consent was\nsuccessful, the Breastfeeding Support Association expressed disappointment that the part regarding formula distribution was not successful. The Parliamentary Ombudsman's resolution stated that the Finnish legislation placing restrictions on gratis infant formula distribution is not meant to apply to medical research, and the same holds for food\nsafety legislation. The Breastfeeding Support Association is looking into whether international conventions require changes to\nlegislation. The Breastfeeding Support Association has stated that many of the problems in the study could perhaps have been avoided if infant formula research would have at least the same checks and balances as drug research has. This would be prudent, since infant\nformula is the only nutrition for most infants in an important phase of their lives and thus it's effects can be much greater than the\neffect of many drugs used only occasionally.\nThe Breastfeeding Support Association has been concerned with outside, partly commercial funding directing the research of NPHI. According to \"Good Research Practic, Handbook\" (2005), outside funding amounts to 40 percent of NPHI's spending, and the policy is to get as much outside funding to carry out NPHI's plan of action as possible. Research on breastmilk was planned in the study the complaint was filed on, but was not carried out because of lack of funding.\nThe director of National Public Health Institute of Finland is a candidate for the Director-General post of the World Health Organization (election to be held 6th-9th November, 2006), and considered to be among the three leading candidates by The Lancet.\nBackground.\nThe Breastfeeding Support Association in Finland is a volunteer association, founded in 1997, whose work is based on the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (article 24) and WHO breastfeeding promotion programs.\nThe Association is funded by membership fees, advertisements in the Imetysuutiset newsletter and fees on training of volunteers. RAY (Finland's Slot Machine Association which funds health and social welfare projects) has awarded the association a grant for 2005/06 for the purpose of establishing a nationwide project, which includes the maintenance and advertising of the Breastfeeding Support Hotline.\nThe City of Helsinki has awarded the Association a small grant annually to support mothers in the Helsinki area. In the other\nmunicipalities in Finland some local groups have had opportunities to apply for grants from local social authorities.\nThe Finnish Parliamentary Ombudsman exercises oversight to ensure that public authorities and officials observe the law and fulfil their du\u00adties in the discharge of their functions. In addition to authorities and officials, the scope of oversight includes also other parties performing public functions.\nThe Ombudsman's office aims to ensure good administration and the observance of constitutional and human rights.\nThe National Public Health Institute of Finland, according to it's website, promotes people's possibilities to live healthy life and is responsible as an expert body under the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health, for providing various professionals and citizens the best available information for their choices."}

And they frighten grown ups.\nA report by the Institute of Public Policy Research, to be published next week, describes British youth as among the worst in Europe. The study compares teenage English and Scots with their counterparts in other European countries. \nFewer British youths ate regularly with their family, and many more spent most evenings with their friends; they were drunk more often, got involved in fights and more had sex than other European youth.\nMore British adults than Continental adults would be reluctant to intervene should they see youths vandalising a bus shelter fearing a violent response. Many adults were fearful of leaving home after dark and a large number were thinking of moving home because of youths \"hanging about\".\nThe demonisation of youth in the British media is said to have induced real fear in many adults.\nMany more comparisons are made in this report. \nRelated reports.\nA study comparing the behaviour of South of England youth in 2005 with that in 1985, concluded that youth now are better behaved than their predecessors. There were marked differences between boys and girls.\nASBOs (Anti-social behaviour orders) are civil actions that can be taken against those who are likely to cause alarm, harassment, or distress to others outside their family. Research by NACRO (National Association for the Care and Resettlement of Offenders) in 2002 concluded that they were a failure. The average ASBO costs more than \u00a35,000 to enforce and takes over three months to obtain. Over one third of all ASBOs were breached within the first 9 months of issue. \nAnother report published today by NACRO criticises some courts for using ASBOs inappropriately and too readily. ASBOs should be seen as the last resort for young offenders. There should be consultations with the local Youth Offending Team (YOT) and the reasons why other remedies were not suitable should be given. There were also indications that ASBOs are being used as weapons of racial discrimination, there being a disproportionate number of young black people being served with ASBOs. In some quarters, youths flaunt ASBOs as a badge of honour."}

The decision came after seeing the current tense situation in New Delhi.\nThe Group of Ministers is headed by Home minister Shivraj Patil and comprised of Law minister H R Bhardwaj, Delhi CM Sheila Dikhit, Union Urban Development minister S Jaipal Reddy and his deputy Ajay Makan.\nS Jaipal Reddy told reporters that it is very difficult to conduct the sealing drive in the city under these circumstances. He made the statement after a meeting of Group of Ministers.\nThe Supreme Court had already sent the notice to Municipal Corporation of Delhi to resume the sealing drive from Thursday. They will approach the apex court on Friday and will apprise the court about the difficulties in carrying out the sealing drive in these circumstances where the traders are going on strike and creating situation of tension in the capital.\nSupreme Court's Monitoring committee called on the MCD to resume the sealing of unauthorised shops in the city on Friday.\nHistory of sealing drive in New Delhi.\nMCD movement to demolish commercial establishments in residential areas.\nOn February 16, 2006, the Delhi High Court handed over a notice to Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) to remove all the commercial ventures in residential areas in the capital. After came the notice from the high court, MCD took up an immediate reaction and started planning the strategy regarding demolition of shops in the colonies. \nOn February 23, 2006, the central government asked High Court (HC) to provide some time to prepare the plan to deal with the violators of building bylaws in the Capital. They asked HC to provide about 3 months to minor violators and in the meanwhile the demolition action could be implementated to major violators. \nAfter came into the decisions of the High Court the people, who were afraid of getting harmed by HC's notice, agitated and became violent. This was followed by suspension of the demolition activities on February 25, 2006. \nHigh Court refrained from passing any order after hearing the application came from central government seeking some time-relief for minor violators on February 27, 2006. A division bench of High Court, comprising Justice Vijender Jain and Justice Rekha Sharma, posted the matter for hearing on March 22, 2006 and sent a notification to MCD for exempting Lal Deora areas from building bylaws in the meanwhile. \nThe opposition parties opposed the HC notice and the matter was raised in Lok Sabha (Lower house of the parliament in India) sessions. MCD passed the resolution to state and central government to approach High court and Supreme Court to make any postponement in demolition on March 13, 2006. Supreme Court fixed March 26, 2006 the deadline for sealing of shops.\nTraders' movement against the demolition activities.\nTraders protested against the demolition activities in the residential areas in the city on March 18, 2006. They demonstrated their anger across the streets in capital after producing the deadline of sealing the shops. They demanded to produce the policy of regularisation of shops in the residential areas. The traders came to take part in the protest from different local areas association, like, Jail Road, Rajouri Garden, Kirti Nagar Mansarovar Garden, Karol Bagh, Rohini colony and South Delhi. Traders called for the bandh (off) on March 21, 2006. \nMCD cleared out that they would not extend the deadline of sealing of illegal commercial establishment in residential areas as the order came from the supreme court. The traders called off the markets and stay closed all the major markets located in residential areas including South Extension, Greater Kailash, Kotla Mubarakpur, Kalkaji, Govindpuri, Green Park, Vikaspuri, Janak Puri, Uttam Nagar, Shalimar Bagh, Pitampura, Ashok Vihar, Model Town, Azadpur, Kamla Nagar, Shakti Nagar, Roop Nagar, Malka Ganj and Patparganj. \nNotifications from the authorities.\nDelhi High Court threatened to dissolve the MCD if they were failed to follow to run accordingly by the law on March 23, 2006. A division bench comprised of Justice Vijender Jain and Justice Rekha Sharma told MCD to form an independent body if they were unable to take action and run in accordance. \nSupreme Court extended the deadline to March 28, 2006 by seeing the contempoary tense situation in the capital on March 24, 2006. The apex court added that there would not be given any misuses of the establishments after June 30, 2006 to those who would file an affidavit with the MCD by March 28, 2006. Delhi High Court asked MCD and DDA to file the affidavits to support legal farmhoses functioning in Delhi. \nThe central government notified the amendments in the Master Plan of Delhi, 2001 by bringing some reliefs to minor traders. Ajay Maken, contemporary minister of state for urban development, on March 28, 2006, said that there should be some criteria to segregate major and minor violators. He added that new policy, naming mixed land used, of segregation would permit legalise commercial activities on the ground floor of residential premises in the city. \nMCD's drive of sealing commercial establishments.\nOn March 29, 2006, MCD started sealing the commercial establishments in residential areas whose owners were failed to file a requistee before the deadline set by the apex court. After expiring the deadline MCD started sealing shops in all the zones under the tight security by police. \nMCD constituted a committee of 6 members to identify the areas where mixed land use policy is applicable. The committee was comprised of Jitender Kochar, Mukesh Goel, Subhash Arya, V K Bugga, Ravi Das and K D Akolia. On the other hand, High Court issued a warrant to the MCD Counsel for not appearing before the court because of the lawyer's stike on March 30, 2006. \nMCD steeped up its sealing drive after warnings came fron HC and SC On April 1, 2006. MCD took action against illegal establishment covering all the zones despite the protest and widespread resistance. \nDelhi Laws (Special Provisions) Bill, 2006.\nOn April 25, 2006, the union urban development minister S Jaipal Reddy said that the central government would provie a bill concerning regularisation of commercial establishment. On May 2, 2006, Reddy added that the bill will provide relief from the sealing drive and demolition in the city. The bill has issues related to demolitions including unauthorised construction, sealing of shops and slum dwellers in the city. \nOn May 8, 2006, chief minister Sheila Dikshit announced that the bill seeking relief from the municipal drive was being framed and would be forwarded to the cabinet ministers soon. On May 10, 2006, Reddy said that the bill is expected to be applied by next week and added that the bill to provide short-term relief would be likely to introduce tomorrow in the parliament. \nMCD announced end of the sealing drive on May 20, 2006 after central government introduced the bill to suspend the action of Municipal authorities. President Kalam named the bill by Delhi Laws (Special Provisions) Bill, 2006. "}

In common law countries, habeas corpus is an important instrument for protecting an individual's freedom against arbitrary state action. \nLong road to military trials.\nThe United States has detained 759 men as \"illegal combatants\" at the Guantanamo Bay detention camp, of whom about 250 have been released or transferred to the custody of other countries. \nAfter the Supreme Court ruled in \"Rasul v. Bush\" (2004) that detainees are entitled to challenge their detentions in federal court, the Defence Department set up the Combatant Status Review Tribunal (CSRT) to review the determinations that the detainees were \"enemy combatants\". The detentions of 558 were reviewed by the CSRT, which confirmed all but 38 of the detainees as \"enemy combatants\". John B. Bellinger III, Legal Adviser to the State Department has indicated last month that the administration plans to try only 60 to 80 of the 435 men currently detained.\nIn December 2005, the Detainee Treatment Act (DTA) was signed into law under which, the habeas petitions of the detainees were to be transferred to the CSRT. The Supreme Court held in \"Hamdan v. Rumsfeld\" (2006) that the DTA did not apply to pending habeas petitions that challenge the legitimacy of the tribunals themselves. This led to the Military Commissions Act of 2006 to be signed into law, under which the administration seeks to strip federal courts of jurisdiction over the detainees' habeas petitions. Instead, detainees can challenge their detention at the CSRT and appeal only for a limited review by the D.C. Circuit Court.\nPreviously, two district courts have given contradictory rulings over the issue of whether the petitioners, who have not been charged but have been detained indefinitely, can petition for habeas rights in federal courts. \nOn Wednesday, attorneys for detainees filed the first full court briefings challenging the administration's interpretation of the detainee laws at the US District Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, in the cases \"Al Odah v. United States\" and \"Boumediene v. Bush\" and \"Khalid v. Bush\".\nSeparately, seven former federal judges filed an amicus brief in support of the detainees' brief.\nThe Justice department is scheduled to file a response by November 13.\nFormer judges file \"amicus\" brief.\nSeven former Federal Circuit and District judges, Shirley M. Hufstedler, Nathaniel R. Jones, Abner J. Mikva, Patricia M. Wald, and retired District Judges George N. Leighton, Frank J. McGarr, and Timothy K. Lewis filed an amicus brief supporting the petitioners' claim, saying that the \"court-stripping\" provisions of the MCA \"challenges the integrity of our judicial system\".\nThe brief argued that the government's interpretation of the \nDTA and MCA would force the court to condone the use of evidence obtained by torture to sentence detainees to indefinite imprisonment, which is prohibited by common law and the Constitution. \nThe brief pointed out that the CSRTs failed to consider whether evidence presented to them was obtained by torture. The brief cited several cases where records of the tribunal proceedings showed that many of them did not address evidence of torture, some cross-examined detainees about torture allegations, but to distance U.S. forces from the alleged torture. Even when the CSRT referred torture allegations for investigation, it did not wait for results before ruling based on the evidence. \nBased on rules that compelled the tribunal to accept the government's evidence against prisoners as presumptively \"genuine and accurate.\", the tribunal relied on incriminating statements by detainees, even though they testified that the statements were obtained by torture and that medical records and other reports confirm the use of torture.\nThe government has maintained that investigating allegations of torture was not \"the CSRT's role\" and has claimed that the tribunals are permitted to rely on evidence \"obtained through a non-traditional means, even torture\" to determine that a prisoner was an enemy combatant. \nPrisoners allege torture.\nThe brief listed several instances where prisoners have alleged \nthe use of torture to extract incriminating statements.\nThe Australian citizen Mamdouh Habib, who was captured in Pakistan in 2001 was \"rendered\" to Egypt, where he alleges he confessed to several terrorism related crimes after being subjected to \"horrific abuse\" by the Egyptian authorities. The tribunal simultaneously found enough credible evidence to order an investigation into the torture allegations and found Habib an enemy combatant based on the same evidence.\nThe brief outlined the case of detainee Mohammed al Qahtani whose interrogation, the Defence Department has said, produced \"detailed information about 30 of Osama Bin Laden's bodyguards who are also held at Guantanamo\". Interrogation logs showed al Qahtani was interrogated for about 20 hours per day for seven weeks, subjected to isolation, intimidated with military dogs, sexually humiliated, and subjected to sleep and sensory deprivation. \nSince the CSRT rules permit secret evidence, suspects implicated by al Qahtani's statements will not be told who accused them or under what circumstances and the accusations will be presumed accurate.\nThe brief pointed out that it was not aware of a single CSRT that allowed a prisoner to develop an evidentiary record to support the allegations of torture. But according to the government's interpretation of the DTA and MCA, the appeals court cannot consider facts outside the CSRT's record when reviewing the CSRT's decision.\nDetainee lawyers challenge new law.\nThe briefs filed by lawyers for the detainees argues that the text of the MCA does not strip the courts of authority to hear pending habeas petitions and does not permit indefinite detention without charge. \nThe briefs argue that if the MCA did indeed repeal habeas rights, then the law is unconstitutional. This, because the CSRT hearings and the limited review by the D.C. Circuit court, which are meant to be the substitute for a habeas review under the Act, are not \"adequate and effective\" to test the legality of the detentions, and hence would violate the Suspension Clause of the U.S. constitution.\nThe MCA interpretation of the review process falls short of the \"adequate and effective\" remedy constitutionally required, according to detainee lawyers, with the following shortcomings -\nThe briefs further argue that the MCA does not prevent the detainees claiming rights under the Geneva Conventions."}

One company in London has cornered 80% of the carbon trading market, part of the green goldrush created by the Kyoto Climate Change Treaty. This company, Climate Exchange plc, now dominates the carbon exchange markets, increasing its turnover from 95 million tonnes of carbon last year to 257 million in the first eight months of this year. Climate Exchange plc is now valued at more than \u00a3160 million \nClimate Exchange plc was founded by James Cameron, previously a negotiator of the Kyoto Treaty. Mr Cameron is quoted as saying about the development of this new market, \"It's what we hoped for. Investment power is power, and you need power to make a change. There is huge vested interest in the status quo, and to shift that you need power\". In Europe the market is expected to more than double from \u20ac9.4 billion (\u00a36.3 billion) last year to \u20ac22 billion (\u00a315.4 billion) this year, according to the analysts Point Carbon. \nAt present USA is not participating in the carbon trading scheme, but individual states may decide to join in. It has been estimated that if ever carbon becomes a world commodity, the value of permits could reach \u20ac1000 billion (\u00a3700 billion). \nIt is claimed by advocates of the scheme that, by putting a price on carbon emissions, pollution can be costed into business decisions. This enables market forces to drive the reduction in emissions, making government regulation unnecessary. Carbon trading is not without detractors who see this free market as an intrusion into public space and point to corruption and failures in accounting and the application of science. \nSean Park, of Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein, gave an example: a wind farm developer could receive tradable carbon credits because the technology had zero carbon emissions. These credits could then be used to raise the capital needed to build the wind farm. In this way, carbon trading promoted the development of low carbon technologies.\nFollowing publication of the Stern Review, which he had commissioned, UK Chancellor Gordon Brown urged member states of the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme to aim for new carbon emission targets. He said that they should reduce emissions by 30% below 1990 levels by 2020 and by at least 60% by 2050. "}

On this day, 401 years ago there was an attempt to blow up the British parliament.\nSince that time, Guy Fawkes day is celebrated by bonfires, fireworks and the parading of effigies called \"guys\".\nThe event is not only celebrated in the United Kingdom, but other Commonwealth countries including New Zealand, South Africa, Newfoundland, Bahamas, Saint Kitts and formerly Australia.\nBritons celebrate a national day of thanksgiving that the Gunpowder plot did not destroy their king and parliament. But as tradition goes, the oppression that Roman Catholics felt was always de-emphasised.\nThis year sees rising opposition to the traditional fireworks and bonfires celebrations. A smog warning has been issued for London on the 5th and British Labour MP Barry Sheerman called for the event to be scrapped.\nThe Gunpowder Plot.\nThe Gunpowder Plot of 1605 was a failed attempt by a few radical Roman Catholics to kill King James I of England, his family, and most of the Protestant aristocracy in a single attack by blowing up the Houses of Parliament during the State Opening. The conspirators had then planned to abduct the royal children, not present in Parliament, and incite a revolt in the Midlands.\nThe plot occurred during the long-running religious battle that followed King Henry VIII's break from Rome in 1534. \nFar from helping their fellow Catholics avoid religious persecution, the plotters put many loyal Catholics in a difficult position. Before this period Catholicism had been associated with Spain and the Inquisition but after the plot it also became thought of as treasonous to be Catholic.\nFawkes was hired to do the \"dirty work\". He entered the Roman Catholic faith at the age of nine, when his mother married a Roman Catholic after the death of his father. As a soldier who went to war in the Netherlands, Fawkes was noted for bravery; he was one of the last to hear of the plot, and rushed into it before knowing the details.\nThe plot was actually planned by Robert Catesby, whose father had been imprisoned for refusing to convert to the Anglican Church. He started his planning two years previously in 1603. But he needed money and ammunition, which forced him to confide in at least 13 people. One of these was Francis Tresham, a brother-in-law of Lord Monteagle, and a member of the House of Lords\nThe plot failed when one of the conspirators warned his brother-in-law not to attend the House of Lords, who, in turn, set off the alarm that resulted in the ringleaders, including Guy Fawkes, being captured and executed."}

But in 2005 it was at 23% and in 2004 it was at 26%. He says that the prisons with the least amount of inmates working are: Rolleston with 8.6%, Mount Eden with 8.7%, Rimutaka with 11%, Christchurch Women's with 13.5% and Dunedin with 13.8%.

Former vice-president Taha Yassin Ramadan was sentenced to life in prison, three other officials received 15 years in prison and one was acquitted.\nProceedings.\nThe five-member Special Tribunal was authorised by the Iraqi Interim Government to try Iraqi nationals or residents accused of genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes or other serious crimes committed during the Ba'ath party rule between 1968 and 2003.\nDuring today's hearing, Judge Rauf Rasheed Abdel Rahman ordered bailiffs to force Saddam, who was shouting out protests, to stand as the verdict was read out. \nHussein was reported as appearing shaken as the verdict was pronounced, and later shouted \"Allahu Akbar!\" (God is greatest) and \"Long live the nation!\".\nThe sentences of death and life in prison carry an automatic appeal, and no time-limit is set for the appeals court review of the case. The law mandates the death sentence to be carried out within 30 days, after all appeals are exhausted.\nFormer U.S. Attorney General Ramsey Clark, who is a defence attorney in the case, was ordered out of the court by the judges, who said that he had come to mock the Iraqi people and the court. Clarke had described the court yesterday as prejudiced and lacking impartiality, and called attention to the killings of Hussein's defence lawyers and the removal of judges from the tribunal.\nReactions.\nIn Iraq.\nAli al-Dabbagh, a spokesman for the Iraqi coalition government said the verdict was as expected, adding \"This is the least that Saddam deserved because his crimes were great. No further punishment was possible.\" \nDeputy Prime Minister Barham Salih called the court \"just and professional\" and said that Saddam was \"given the justice he denied to the people of Iraq over 35 years\".\nA Sunni member of parliament, speaking under anonymity to Reuters, however called the judgement \"a political verdict from a political court.\"\nPopular reaction.\nThe verdict was announced amidst increased security measures in Iraq, including curfews in Baghdad and other cities. Despite the curfew, around a thousand people were reported as coming out into the streets of the Shiite-dominated Sadr City in celebration and gunfire was heard in Baghdad. \nCelebrations were also reported in Dujail, where the killings took place. \nDespite the curfew, about a thousand people demonstrated in Tikrit carrying pictures of Saddam Hussein. Some Sunnis were reported as denouncing the verdict as a \"product of the US occupation forces\".\nFighting is reported to have broken out in Adhimiyah, a Sunni district of Baghdad, within half an hour of the verdict. There was heavy firing and mortar shells landed near the Abu Hanifa mosque.\nInternational reactions.\nThe U.S. Ambassador to Iraq, Zalmay Khalilzad said the verdict was \"an important milestone for Iraq\". \nThe U.K. Foreign Secretary Margaret Beckett welcomed the trial's conclusion, saying it was \"right\" that Saddam and the other accused have to face Iraqi justice, and that they have been \"held to account for their crimes\".\nMalcolm Smart, the Middle East and North Africa Director for Amnesty International said that the tribunal's proceedings failed to meet necessary standards for a fair trial.\nHussein's verdict was delivered during highly contested midterm elections in United States; where the party most insistent upon an American occupation of Iraq (Republican - GOP) lagged in polls due to domestic controversies."}

Her instatement comes as the previous governor, Peter Obi, was impeached by the state legislature for alleged gross misconduct.\nEtiaba initially refused the position, saying that the impeached man was still the governor and her boss. However, she later accepted the position due to what she called the \"peculiarity of the situation\". Both the 64-year-old Etiaba and 45-year-old Obi have been in office since March 2006 after the previous governor's election was overturned by a court.\nThe new governor may not last in her job, however. While Obi does not contest the legality of Etiaba's swearing in, he intends to contend the impeachment in court. Additionally, the ongoing impeachment proceedings may yet cause Etiaba herself to be removed from office if she is indicted for the same misconduct as her former boss. \nEtiaba was also criticized by a number of local religious and community leaders, who put out a statement condemning both the original impeachment of Obi as well as the promotion of Etiaba. The statement reads in part:\nEtiaba is expected at the impeachment hearing today."}

However, the practice of blacking out the entire affiliated station is relatively unusual, raising the question of whether the move was politically motivated to favor right wing syndicated news programming over the liberal leanings of Air America reports.\nIn a news report published by \"The Huffington Post\", author Josh Silver claims that the difference is not political \"per se\", as several of the companies that withdrew advertising support were companies that made major contributions to the Democratic parties. Instead, he suggests the difference is that Air America journalism occasionally focuses on corporate malfeasance.\nOther political programming, such as Rush Limbaugh or the Daily Show, rarely cover corporate behavior.\nThe bankruptcy filing by Air America underscores the dilemma faced by news media outlets that depend on advertising revenues from business and government to survive. The exact reasons for the blackballing of Air America are unclear, but if unflattering editorial programming can be held hostage to protect the interests of a news organization's sponsors, chances for a vibrant press are reduced.\nAir America Radio was known best for its flagship program, Al Franken show.

The Herald said that Mr Mallard, the Auckland City Council and Helen Clark, Prime Minister of NZ, all prefer a new stadium. \"The decision is vital in order to deliver a world-class stadium which complements and enhances the city's conference and major event-hosting potential, and which will also drive Auckland's aspirations to be a world-class city,\" Mr Mallard said.\nMs Clark said: \"A site that is not surrounded by residential housing is an attractive proposition but the critical issue will be practical limitations.\" She added: \"Cabinet would not be hurried into making a decision.\"\nHowever Ports of Auckland (POA), owners of the waterfront land, said that there will not be a stadium before the 2011 Rugby World Cup.

Sai Baba attracts followers from many countries around the world who revere him as a \"living god\".\nAround 200 youth are due to fly to India on November 13th after receiving a \"divine commandment\" to carry out a month-long \"humanitarian pilgrimage\" that will coincide with the birthday celebrations of Sai Baba, who will be 81 on November 23rd. \nPressure has been mounting on the Duke of Edinburgh award scheme charity to break its association with the Baba's organisation. \nBackground.\nClaims of sexual abuse by Sai Baba have been circulating for several decades, stating that such abuse takes place during private interviews at his base in Puttaparthi, Andhra Pradesh.\nLarge numbers of youth have travelled to India to visit the holy man and hear his teachings. Followers say that their experiences were \"spiritually enriching\". Some former devotees who were interviewed in a BBC programme, \"The Secret Swami\", claimed that the religious guru massaged their testicles with oil and coerced them into oral sex. During the last youth group pilgrimage in 2004, group interviews were granted to several young people although no abuse was reported.\nThe allegations are denied by the Baba's followers and Sai Baba has never been charged with any offenses. The US State Department, however, issued a travel advisory in 2001 that warned of \"inappropriate sexual behaviour by a prominent local religious leader\", which refers to the Baba, as officials confirm.\nDuke of Edinburgh Awards.\nIn July the UK Sai Organisation was awarded a certificate for their \"invaluable contribution\" to the Awards scheme at a garden party in Buckingham Palace. An official Sai Baba website hosted a news story about this event that was later removed after a personal intervention by Peter Westgarth, who stated that it contained misrepresentations of the events. \nIn the posting, Shitu Chudasama (National Co-ordinator for Sai Youth UK and a devotee) had spoken of giving a speech to \"various dignitaries, diplomats, ministers [and] famous celebrities\" at Buckingham Palace, and related that every listener was \"hanging on to his every word\". Chudasama had also claimed to have had a private audience with HRH Prince Philip at St. James's Palace sometime last year, where he attributed the inspiration and motivation of the Sai Youth to their leader.\nReactions.\nThe humanitarian work carried out by the youth will consist chiefly of providing medical aid, and will earn them a Duke of Edinburgh award that is bestowed for projects that enhance personal development and welfare work. \nIn a response to DNA, an unnamed public relations officer representing Sathya Sai Baba confirmed that the youth would be arriving at the ashram in a fortnight. Speaking about the sex abuse allegations, he said: \"We do not care what the [US State Dept.] advisory says. People and organisations can write whatever they want to believe. We have no more to say on this issue.\"\nShitu Chudasama also stated that the pilgrimage was merely a humanitarian mission for the benefit of the improverished people in the local area, and that the sexual abuse allegations levelled against the Baba were \"totally unfounded\". He continued: \"We hope to have an interview with Sai Baba but it's not guaranteed. If he wants to see us, he'll call us.\"\nTom Sackville, a former Home Office minister and chairman of FAIR told the Guardian: \"\"It is appallingly naive for the award scheme to involve young people and the royal family with an organisation whose leader is accused of paedophilia. Parents who plan to send their children on this month's pilgrimage ... should be aware of the danger their children are being exposed to.\"\nHowever, Peter Westgarth, chief executive of the Awards charity, said: \"This is not the only religion accused of paedophilia. Young people who are participating on these trips are doing so because they choose to.\" He continued: \"The awards accredit the good work they do for poor people in India. We make no judgment about their religion. We would no sooner intervene here than we would the Church Lads' and Girls' Brigade.\"\nConservative MP Hon. Michael Gove stated that he would compose a letter to the charity urging them to consider stricter controls and monitoring of organisations that they associate and work with. \"As a society we need a more determined effort to identify and expose those religious cults and extremists that pose a direct threat to people, so that they do not enjoy patronage that should be directed elsewhere,\" he said."}

MSNBC projects that the Democrats now control 234 seats in the House of Representatives, 16 more seats than the 218 needed to control the House of Representatives as all 435 seats were up for election. In the Senate, where the balance of power is closer, one-third of all seats were up for grab. As of 10:00 p.m. EST, AP and Reuters were projecting that the Democrats had picked up all six seats they needed to retake the Senate, including the seats of incumbents Rick Santorum (Penn.), Lincoln Chafee (R.I.), Jim Talent (Missouri), Mike DeWine (Ohio), John Tester (Montana), and Jim Webb (VA). The Tester victory by less than 3,000 votes was projected at approximately 2 p.m. EST after the State of Montana announced the results of overnight recounts. Democrat Jim Webb has prevailed in that race by slightly more than 7,000 votes, though his opponent has not conceded and a recount may still occur.\nIssues.\nAlthough the Bush Administration's policy on Iraq was seen as a major issue by voters, exit polls indicated that corruption was of greater concern. Republicans found themselves plagued by a series of scandals in recent months, ranging from the Jack Abramoff corruption scandal to revelations about sexual improprieties involving well-known Republicans, including Congressman Mark Foley and White House confidant Ted Haggard. Many conservative evangelical Christians, the GOP's most reliable voting block, have become disappointed by the scandals and may not vote in great numbers. Pat Buchanan, whose campaigns have often appealed to that voting block, told ABC News, \"There's the spending orgy, the arrogance of power . . . . The war in Iraq, failure to protect our border, hurting the working class in Ohio, for example, the list goes on and on. We're more dissatisfied with the Republican Party than we've ever been.\"\nVoter turnout was also influenced by a number of initiatives on state ballots. Michigan's Proposal 2 would outlaw affirmative action in virtually all government programs. Oklahoma voters were slated to decide if stores could sell alcohol on election days. In South Dakota, voters were asked if the state should make marijuana use legal for therapeutic purposes. Many states included initiatives related to eminent domain powers, same-sex marriage, and taxes. In California, voters faced a whopping 36 initiatives. Voters energized by initiatives were more likely to show up at the polls, and more likely to vote for candidates from their party.\nCampaigns turn nasty.\nSeveral races turned nasty in the closing days of the campaign, with candidates from both parties turning up the heat on their opponents and accusing their rivals of dirty tricks. MSNBC reported that the FBI was investigating calls made to voters in Virginia in an apparent attempt to intimidate and confuse voters. This follows a similar investigation in California, where staff in Republican Congressional candidate Tan D. Nguyen's campaign office sent letters to Latino voters telling them that \"You are advised that if your residence in this country is illegal or you are an immigrant, voting in a federal election is a crime that could result in jail time.\" Naturalized citizens are allowed to vote in elections.\nCandidates in both New York and Michigan reported that automated telephone calls had been made to voters in the dead of night, purporting to be from their campaigns. The candidates said their campaigns had nothing to do with the calls, and had been made fraudulently in an attempt to make voters angry at them. \nIt was unclear whether these calls were related to other calls, financed by the National Republican Congressional Committee, that had been made to voters in several states in the previous week. Those calls had generated complaints by voters from both parties who said they were repeated several times in the same day. In at least one state, the calls were pulled when the attorney general notified the NRCC that the calls violated state law.\nA different kind of \"robocall\" was reported in Iowa, where three Democratic candidates for the state House reported that they had been the target of anonymous attack ad calls. The calls inaccurately claimed that the candidates support free health care and college tuition for illegal aliens.\nThe New Jersey Attorney General's office sent deputies to polling places after Republicans reported possible fraud. The deputies reportedly found no problems.\nThe Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund photographed armed men attempting to prevent Hispanic voters from entering polling places in Tucson. The photographs and reports of the incidents were sent to the FBI.\nPolling Problems.\nProblems with voting devices, both electronic and manual, required some polling places to remain open later than scheduled. Electronic devices were being used for the first time in about a third of the states.\nAir America Radio reported that electronic voting machines in Delaware County, Indiana and Cleveland, Ohio malfunctioned, frustrating voters and election workers. A report published on the USA Today website said election workers in some parts of Florida had resorted to using paper ballots when their electronic voting machines failed to work. National Public Radio reported that some electronic voting machines in Texas had to be turned off when they improperly gave votes to candidates not selected by voters. Problems were also reported in Maine, Maryland, and Pennsylvania.\nA voting problem of a different type was reported in Kentucky. A Louisville poll worker is alleged to have physically assaulted a voter. Jefferson County clerk spokesperson Paula McCraney said that the voter wanted to press charges after being allegedly choked and pushed by the election worker. No information was available on what led to the incident.\nSummaries by state.\nThose marked * are incumbent in the 109th Congress; those marked \u2020 served in the House in the 109th Congress; those marked \u2021 served in a previous Congress.

Predictions of an unusually high level of voter turnout seem to be coming to fruition as voters throughout the country report longer than expected lines. One voter from Kansas City, Missouri reported a 90-minute wait, while voters in southwest Michigan reported that they had to park several blocks from the polls because of the crowds. Typically, fewer than 40% of registered voters go to the polls during non-presidential election years. The highest midterm voter turnout on record occurred in 1970, when 47% of registered voters went to the polls.\nElectronic voting gets mixed reviews.\nA third of the states are using electronic voting systems for the first time. Although it was predicted that the electronic systems would be more efficient, reports are mixed about their effectiveness. Air America Radio reports that electronic voting machines in Delaware County, Indiana and Cleveland, Ohio have malfunctioned, frustrating voters and election workers.

No information was available on what led to the incident.\nCongressional control at stake.\nAll seats in the House of Representatives and one-third of the seats in the Senate are up for election. Polls on the eve of the election indicated that the Democrats were likely to take control of the House, with several estimates giving the party a gain of about 30 seats. In the Senate, where the Democrats need six seats to gain a majority, the outcome is less certain. At least five races are considered too close to call.\n\"Six year itch\".\nMany political pundits expect Democratic gains during this election. Control of Congress has frequently changed hands during midterm elections held during a president's second term. This trend coincides with recent polls that show Americans becoming further disillusioned with Republican control in the wake of growing discontentment about the Iraq War and a wave of scandals ranging from the Jack Abramoff corruption scandal to revelations about sexual improprieties involving Republican Congressman Mark Foley and White House confidant Ted Haggard. Many conservative evangelical Christians, the GOP's most reliable voting block, have become disappointed by the scandals and may not vote in great numbers.

The survey published today, revealed that NHS infection control staff felt that infection control was inadequately financed, that training was inadequate and that much time has to be spent reassuring patients. \nThe Association is concerned that the financial deficits of many NHS trusts may prejudice good infection control practice because the resources allocated for this are not effectively ring-fenced. There was evidence of inadequate training and execution of good practice. The report also listed shortcomings in way supplies were acquired and delays in getting supplies of the preferred disinfectant: 2% -based solution.\nBBC reported that a recent paper to a Society for General Microbiology conference by a University of Leeds team has shown that two chemical cleaners commonly used in hospitals, far from reducing the prevalence of \"\" (\"C. difficile\") bacterium, actually increased its ability to survive. Only cleaners containing bleach had been proved effective in disposing of this bacterium. Authors of the paper refused to disclose what those two cleaners were. \nThere is particular concern in the Patients' Association about the absence of adequate data on the spread of \"C. difficile\". The \"Telegraph\" quotes Katharine Murphy, of the Patients' Association, as saying: \"Collection of data about this very dangerous infection is haphazard to say the least, and we are not getting the true picture. How can patients have confidence in their hospitals if the real threat posed by \"C. difficile\" is being played down?\" \nThe Report found that only a fifth of respondents confirmed the collection of surgical-site infection data and that only 27% reported infection data about \"C. difficile\"; despite the requirement that Trusts collect and report these data. \nTrusts are also required to report the incidence of surgical-site infection, but the Patients' Association survey found that only a fifth of respondents confirmed the collection of these data.\nThe Patients Association called this a \"worrying and haphazard situation\". \nThe \"Telegraph\" reports that experts consider that \"C. difficile\" is an even greater threat to patient's health than .\nLeicester NHS Trust has reported 49 deaths associated with \"C. difficile\". in three of its hospitals. Six deaths have been reported at Maidstone Hospital and the Healthcare Commission has been asked to investigate. \"C. difficile\" was associated with the deaths of nearly 1000 patient in 2003.\nA new Code of Practice \"for the prevention and control of healthcare associated infections\" was issued by the Department of Health in October 2006 under the Health Act 2006.

Such situations were becoming more dangerous for police as weapons became more commonplace in the hands of criminals.

The group of icebergs have traveled a total distance of 13,500 km.\nThe A-43 measured 167 km long and 32 km wide. But when it moved into Scotia Sea, southern Atlantic, in January 2005, it broke apart further then measuring 51 km long and 21 km wide, and had also gained a new name, A-43A. NIWA believes that the A-43A then travelled 13,500 km around Antarctica, landing near Auckland Islands and Stewart Island ending its journey. \"Based on A-43A's last recorded position, and assuming it travelled the shortest possible route around Antarctica, we calculate an average speed of 0.9km/h or about 21.5 kilometres a day,\" Dr Williams said, \"Somewhere along the way, A-43A has broken into smaller pieces.\"\nThe A-43A spent five years drifting east in the Antarctic Circumpolar Current.\nThe A-43A is now heading towards the Chatham Islands, passing Mid-Canterbury on the way.\nDr Williams said: \"Despite its size, the monster berg is probably riddled with holes and catastrophic failure could see it \"just fall to pieces\" relatively quickly, Dr Williams said. The flotilla would probably drift about 300km up the east coast of the South Island before veering back out to sea.\" In the next ten days the icebergs could be visible from the Otago coast, \"There is an outside chance they might be spotted from the mainland provided they broke up into smaller icebergs.\""}

The new procedure involves injecting the patient's heart with his own bone marrow stem cells in the expectation that they will help repair the damaged heart and prolong the patient's active life. \nTwo advantages claimed for this procedure are the overcoming of the ethical issues related to the use of embryonic stem cells and the reduction of the probability of tissue rejection.\nThe procedure will be carried out immediately after primary angioplasty, the opening up of blocked arteries, normally performed within the vital few hours after the heart attack. \nThe new procedure was designed by Dr Anthony Mathur, Senior Lecturer and Consultant Cardiologist, and Professor John Martin, British Heart Foundation Chair in Cardiovascular Sciences. The trial will involve about 100 patients and will be conducted at St Bartholomew's Hospital.\nProfessor Peter Weissberg, Medical Director, British Heart Foundation welcomed research into the role stem cells may play in treating heart conditions and saw it as complementing the Foundation's own research programme.\nSome 600,000 patients survive heart attacks each year and the cost to the country may be as much as \u00a37 billion taking into account not only hospitalisation and medical costs, but also the costs of lost working time. The bone marrow cell transplant is expected to improve the functionality of the damaged heart and increase greatly the capability of patients. It could have a significant economic effects also.\nNigel Hawkes in the \"Times\" today argues that it may be unwise to proceed when so little is understood about stem cells. Maybe it would be better to hold back until the science is better developed. He describes the procedure as coming from the \"quick and dirty\" school of medical research which has produced great benefits before the science has caught up. On the other hand he quotes Roger Pedersen, of the University of Cambridge as saying that we know little about what triggers cells to differentiate, and that \"simple alchemy\" will not work: \"We're going to have to do some science.\" The feasibility and safety of the procedure has been tested in smaller studies, and the few reports available show a trend towards positive effects, but large clinical trials are still missing."}

The event, called a was at least partially visible from most of the planet, except from Europe when the transit happened during local nighttime.\nVisible as a perfectly round dot only 1/195th the diameter of the Sun, Mercury took about an hour and a half to move across the southern limb of the Sun, starting at 7:12PM UTC and ending at 9:41PM UTC.\nFrom the point of view of the Earth, transits of this type can only occur with the two innermost planets - Mercury and Venus. Due to the orbital inclination of Mercury - 7\u00b0 relative to the Earth - transits do not happen every time Mercury passes the Earth every 116 days. Only once every 23 times does a transit happen. The last time Mercury transited the Sun was May 7, 2003. The next transit will occur on May 9, 2016.\nSuch rare events have fascinated astronomers since the invention of the telescope first allowed them to view them. , for example, found Australia's east coast while on a voyage to track the transit of in 1769. Recording these transits allowed astronomers to make the first accurate calculations of the distance between the Sun and the Earth.\nWhile not scientifically used for this purpose anymore, transits provide a glimpse into one way astronomers can currently search for extra-solar planets. Astronomers using this method of searching will monitor other stars to see if the star dims ever so slightly as an extra-solar planet passes between the star it is orbiting and the Earth. Being able to detect such a small, temporary drop in brightness may indicate the presence of such a planet.\nViewing solar transits are fascinating, but only if done safely. People must never look directly at the Sun at any time! The safest way of viewing a transit is to project the image of the Sun as seen through a telescope onto a screen. It may also be viewed with properly made and placed solar filters."}

{"id": "54341", "revid": "39076", "url": "https://en.wikinews.org/wiki?curid=54341", "title": "Virginia Bill of Rights to deny legal status to same-sex and unmarried relationships", "text": " A ballot referendum to amend the Virginia Bill of Rights that denies to same-sex and unmarried couples any legal status that approximates that granted to married couples was approved by state voters during the U.S. midterm election by a 57% to 43% margin.\nThe Virginia result, along with voters from seven other U.S. states who decided on similar constitutional amendments, brings the total to 27 states that now constitutionally ban the recognition of same-sex unions at the state level. Arizona voters failed to pass a similar ballot initiative this election cycle, making it the first and only U.S. state to reject a constitutional ban.\nBoth the governor of Virginia, Tim Kaine, and Senator-elect, Jim Webb, publically opposed the amendment before the vote. Governor Kaine said the broad language against the recognition of the \"legal status for relationships of unmarried individuals\u201d within the referendum might have negative consequences on the state's business climate. Further, that \"it would invite protracted court challenges in areas including contracts, custody cases and end-of-life decisions.\"\nThe Attorney General of Virginia, Robert F. McDonell argued that the rights of unmarried individuals are still protected, because such legal protections flow from common law, not solely from marriage.\nHowever, the Bill of Rights is the basis and foundation of government. Thus, as discussed by Raymond A. Warren, any portion of common law that is determined by the seven-member Virginia Supreme Court to be in conflict with the amendment would no longer provide any such protection within Virginia.\nThe amendment establishes a section that explicitly prevents the government from recognizing the legal status of any relationships outside of heterosexual marriage. Though paragraph one of the amendment specifically bans same-sex marriage, paragraph two prevents the government from recognizing the legal status of any relationship of unmarried individuals that would in anyway approximate marriage.\nTransfer of power and business concerns.\nJudge Warren argues that one of the greatest dangers of this amendment is that \u201cno body knows what the sentence means\u201d. The Judge\u2019s position is reinforced by the views of an eminent Professor of Law within Virginia, who is a recognized expert on the social issues surrounding marriage. The professor described the amendment as \u201cmurky\u201d. \nJudge Warren argues that this modification affectively transfers broad power to the 7-member Supreme Court to interpret how this amendment affects the existing laws, benefits and rights that unwed partners currently enjoy. This would be in contrast to instead creating public policies, which could be adjusted through democratic processes as social understandings of the underlying issues evolve.\nThe Judge\u2019s argument, which is consistent with Tim Kaine\u2019s and Senator-elect Jim Webb\u2019s position, is that there will be significant costs to the society and many years of uncertainty, as these issues are worked-out in the courts. \nFor instance, the domestic partner benefits that are offered by many companies operating in Virginia are a concern. Since corporate policies must be consistent with Virginia law, these domestic partner benefits are at risk. This uncertainty may then discourage both the talent and the employers who need to attract that talent from doing business in the state. \nMaking \u201cmurky\u201d modifications to the very foundation of government, which in-turn underlies the most complex social system in history, argues for prudence and pause.\nPotential for unintended impacts on current law.\nAll of Virginia\u2019s current laws were formed on the foundation that they needed to secure the rights identified in the Bill of Rights. However, that foundation has now fundamentally changed. The state is now forbidden from recognizing a broad set of previously recognized rights associated with unwed relationships. So many existing laws may now be unconstitutional, or will no longer safeguard same-sex or unwed couples and their families.\nFor example, in 2004 Ohio passed a similar amendment with practically identical language. They also had a 27-year-old domestic-violence law that was applied to all domestic partners. But on May 30, 2006, Ohio\u2019s Third Appellant Court ruled that that law was now unconstitutional due to Ohio\u2019s 2004 \u201cDefense of Marriage\u201d amendment. Though Ohio\u2019s Supreme Court must still hear this case, it does demonstrate how the amendment threatens the stability of existing laws concerning unwed relationships. An excerpt from the ruling follows:\nStabilizing the marriage tradition.\nThe institution of marriage, as a union between one man and one woman has been a dominant tradition within our society for at least 2 thousand years. The existence of a fundamental tradition that is rooted with the procreation of the human species argues for a conservative and measured approach when faced with absorbing the changes demanded by an evolving society. (Buckley and Ribstein)\nSince the recognition of same-sex marriage represents a significant departure from these traditions, Virginia law has prohibited same sex marriage for over 30 years. Judge Warren argues that it would have been unlikely that Virginia's rather conservative judges would have changed the definition of marriage, even without the amendment.\nHowever, supporters of the amendment are also concerned that the recognition of new standard form relationships, such as same-sex unions could have unintended consequences.\nFor example, a writer of \"The Weekly Standard\", Stanley Kurtz, a fellow at the Hudson Institute, blames same-sex marriage in the Netherlands for an increase in parental cohabitation contracts. He asserts that same-sex marriage has detached procreation from marriage in the Dutch mind and would likely do the same in the United States.\nHowever, in the 1999 case of , the Vermont court rejected as illogical and lacking empirical support, the argument that giving the same benefits to same sex and heterosexual couples would have unpredictable effects on the institution of marriage(Buckley and Ribstein). However, it stopped short of requiring the recognition of same sex marriage. The court noted that arguments about destabilization of the institution of marriage are \u201cnot altogether irrelevant. A sudden change in the marriage laws or the statutory benefits traditionally incidental to marriage may have disruptive and unforeseen consequences.\u201d\nSecurity of Individual Rights.\nThe 1776 Bill of Rights was the first document in the Americas to declare protection of Individual Rights to all people, to define these rights as forming the foundation of the government and to recognize Individual Rights as being superior to all other Laws instituted by the government. \nRights differ fundamentally from other instituted laws. Individual Rights are an inherent power or liberty, not awarded by human power, to which one is justly entitled and which cannot be legally deprived or restricted by government. Laws, on the other hand, are the obligations and restrictions instituted by governments that are needed to secure those rights. Since rights are considered superior to laws, the judicial branch should necessarily strike down the passage of any law that violates any of these rights. \nThe state Supreme Courts of Massachusetts in 2003 and of New Jersey last month, have ruled that anti-same-sex marriage laws were unconstitutional because they found that the state had to give the same rights to gay couples as they did to heterosexual couples.\nTo avoid this outcome, proponents of preserving only heterosexual marriage as an acceptable partnership, have chosen to amend marriage laws, which carried the risk of being found unconstitutional, into the Bill of Rights.\nThe following sections of the Virginia Bill of Rights may be in conflict with the \u201cMarriage\u201d amendment:\nThe Bill of Rights is also a vehicle whereby Virginia decided what is a right.

It was first drafted by Matt Robson of the NZ Progressive Party, and was then taken on by Martin Gallagher from the New Zealand Labour Party.\nHowever, the Labour-led government is being attacked for interfering with the liquor purchase age bill. Before the debate on the bill, two ministers who are against raising the age, justice minister Mark Burton and associate health minister, Damien O'Conner both announced that they would fully review the sale/supply of liquor to people below the age of 18, regardless of whether the bill were passed or not. The review will most likely look at how many off-licence outlets there are and increased law enforcement of the drink age. Mr Burton said that he did not pre-empt the bill voting, he said: \"It was important to ensure all options were on the table before the vote. What we are saying is you can have confidence that if the bill doesn't proceed there will be an alternative vehicle for addressing the issues immediately thereafter.\"\nMany MPs said that it was unorthodox to intrude in such a manner in the voting process. Leader of Jim Anderton's Progressive coalition and supporter of the bill, Jim Anderton, said: \"Making a last-minute plea to MPs is not to be fooled by the promise of the unnecessary review. This is the review you have when you want to give parliamentarians a soft option. We do not have that luxury. And I hear that sigh of relief in many places, 'oh gosh you've got a review so we don't have to make a hard decision'. Well this is the place for hard decisions and this is where the buck stops.\"\nChristopher Bishop, a spokesman for the Keep it 18 campaign, said: \"We welcome the Government's moves to review the supply of alcohol to minors in the likely event that the Sale of Liquor Amendment Bill is defeated today. Raising the drinking age is never going to work as a way of dealing with New Zealand's drinking culture. It is a simplistic and knee-jerk solution \u2013 a legislative sledgehammer.\"\nChester Burrows, National MP, said: \"My experience is I've seen too many pissed young people, raped young people, assaulted young people.\"\nWayne Mapp, National MP, said he favours a split age, 18 and 19-year-olds are allowed to drink in pubs but not to buy alcohol at liquor stores until they are 20. \"They [the two who introduced the review] should have waited till Parliament decides, rather than trying to dictate,\" he said.\nGordon Copeland, United Future MP, who also preferred the split age, said he had \"no doubt the move would influence the way people voted. It was a most unfortunate interference.\"\nSimon Power, National MP, said: \"It [the bill] is inconsistent. It requires peculiar legal definition and will make life more difficult and harder for the police to enforce.\" \nRon Mark, New Zealand First MP, said: \"Are we going to do something, or are we going to do nothing?\" asked New Zealand First list MP Ron Mark. \"We can at least let this bill go through to the next stage.\"\nRoss Bell, spokesman for the Drug Foundation, said: \"Not only is such a review too narrow, it also seemed to pre-empt the outcome of Wednesday's debate. A cynical person might think the announcement gave MPs an excuse not to support the bill. That review has already been looked at by the Law and Order Select Committee, and what is needed is a review of price and availability of alcohol.\"\nHowever it has been suggested by the select committee previously researching the drinking problem in New Zealand that there is little hard evidence 18 &amp; 19 year olds are buying alcohol for minors, with the largest problem instead being the purchasing of alcohol by parents for their children."}

George Allen (R-VA) today conceded the senatorial race to Democrat James Webb, confirming that there would be a Democratic majority in the Senate and the House for the first time in over a decade.\nWith this win, the Democrats have now gained more seats in Congress than the Republicans did in the 1994 'Republican Revolution' that first brought Conservatives to control of the House and the Senate.\nWebb won the Virginia seat by 7200 votes out of 2.37 million, as reported by the Washington Post. When Allen did not request a recount, that ensured a Democratic majority in the Senate.\nRumor said that Allen had hoped to use his Senate seat as a springboard to a run for the Presidency; and more rumors suggested that if Vice President Dick Cheney were forced to resign (\"due to ill health\") following investigations of laws broken by Bush and Cheney, that Allen had hoped to be appointed in Cheney's stead. With the loss of the Senate seat, Allen's visions of a Presidential run have become impossible.\nWebb, who was a decorated Vietnam veteran and an early opponent of the war in Iraq, is quoted (by atrios at http://atrios.blogspot.com/) as saying that he was particularly concerned with issues of economic fairness and social justice:\n\"[It was reported] that I came to the Democratic party purely on issues regarding the Iraq war. Nothing could be further from the truth.\nI think I and a lot of people like me had aligned themselves with the Republican party on national security issues but were always concerned about issues of economic fairness and social justice.\""}

Veterans in Canada sell red poppies to remember the soldiers that fought in War which is now called Remembrance Day.\nMichael Kalmanovitch, owner of The Earth's General Store, who has been selling white poppies for the past three years, says the white poppies symbolize the hope for peace.\nA veteran at the Royal Canadian Legion says that white poppies are an insult and may infringe on the legion's trademark.\n\"If he, Kalmanovitch [the owner] doesn't, then we will proceed with further legal action,\" said Steven Clark, Ottawa-based remembrance co-ordinator who oversees the poppy trademark for the Legion.\nA British organization called the Peace Pledge Union in London, England started the distribution of white poppies in 1993, and over the years the idea has been sold to Canada. The white poppy is a symbol of opposition to the war and they also pay tribute to the pain of those who have lost someone in war.\nMr. Kalmanovitch says that he won't cease white poppy sales until he's officially been notified by the Peace Pledge Union, a British organization that took over from the Women's Co-Operative Guild to distribute the white poppies worldwide.\nMarya Nyland, who belongs to Women in Black, an international peace organization, which has been distributing the white poppies across Canada for the last 11 years, said, \"Peace is free. You never buy peace.\"\n\"It's offensive and it's disturbing that this white poppy would appear at this time of year,\" he said. \"To me, the white poppy is an insult to the veterans. The Women in Black organization, I think, are piggybacking on the sacred time of the year,\" said Harvey Shevalier, president of the Legion's Alberta-Northwest Territories Command.\nPeace activists are advised to focus their efforts on September 21, UN-sanctioned International Day of Peace. However, white poppies would still infringe on the Legion's trademark even if they change the date to Sept. 21.\nThe poppies are CAN$2 apiece and sell quickly. Two-hundred of them sold on Monday and the store has ordered more, according to Mr. Kalmanovitch, the store owner.\nAbout 12,000 white poppies are distributed each November in Canada."}

However that pricing is only based on concept drawings at this point in time. The government will provide half of the funding for the waterfront stadium but they will only provide funding for the Eden Park upgrade if it was considered to be for regional purposes and not a national stadium.\nMr Mallard said: \"The government has decided that a waterfront location is the option that can most meaningfully contribute to the Government's vision for Auckland as a truly world-class, international city. This has been a finely balanced call with little difference between the two options in terms of cost and construction timelines. Advice from the experts shows that both can be delivered on time.\"\nThe greatest concern facing the government is if they will be able to build the new stadium in time but construction will being in December 2007 to be finished by 2010, and also investigators said that it would be possible. \"We have had advice from Australasia's leading stadium designers, engineers, architects and construction experts. There is a unanimous view that the waterfront stadium is a challenge, but eminently achievable,\" Mr Mallard said.\n\"In making its decision, the government believes that a sports stadium has the ability to contribute to the identity of Auckland and New Zealand. A national stadium will be as much a focal point of Auckland's landscape as Rangitoto or the Sky Tower. We also believe the construction of an iconic facility such as this will help drive Auckland's aspirations for the development of the waterfront and CBD.\"\nReferring to the upgrade of Eden Park, Mr Mallard said: \"One of the greatest concerns is that its application for consents has unacceptable uncertainty as to the timing and outcome of the consents within the construction time available. There is also risk around the lack of flexibility in a residential area around construction times, should delays or problems with construction arise.\"\nThe government will also need to pass a special bill that will enable them to build the required options because of consent issues.\nThe government had also considered these following options: Eden Park (various options), CBD waterfront (various options), North Harbour Stadium, Manukau Harbour (adjoining Westfield station), The former Carlaw Park, Mt Smart Stadium, Avondale Racecourse, The Auckland Domain and Jade Stadium."}

We have two 49ers,\" Allen said during the afternoon press conference in . Allen garnered 49.25% of the vote, compared to the 49.55% who supported Webb. \"I do not wish to cause more rancor by protracted litigation that would not, in my opinion, alter the results.\"\nThe concession by Allen in traditionally Republican Virginia follows what were once prospects for an Allen 2008 presidential bid. An easy Allen re-election campaign to the Senate was expected, but what came was the Democrats ability to frame the election as a national referendum on the war in Iraq. Democrats may have succeeded nationally to draw on the issue of Iraq, but local politics were very much in play in Northern Virginia. \nAccording to the \"Virginia Pilot\", \"Unofficial returns gave Democratic nominee Webb a 120,000-vote advantage over Allen in Northern Virginia's eight localities. But Webb trailed badly across most of the rest of the state and would have decisively lost the election without his Northern Virginia support.\" The margin by which Webb won was 9,000 votes.\nAllen's formulaic stance against tax increases, whether for highway taxes to improve congested northern highway and commuter corridors, or outright fiscal conservativism of all taxes in the face of a burgeoning national deficit, worked against him. \nThe state constitutional amendment banning recognition of same-sex marriage supported by Allen, but opposed by Webb and Governor , and most Northern Virginians, worked against Allen in the election."}

He was then appointed by the President during congressional recess in August. This recess appointment must now be confirmed by the Senate.\nBolton's previous confirmation stalled after the Senate committee's demands for information about Bolton's activities while he was in the State Department were rejected by the administration. In addition, there were concerns about whether or not he had exaggerated reports about Syria's weaponry and doubts about the suitability of his temperament as an Ambassador for the United States. \nWhile the Senate is in recess, the President can make appointments which have to be ratified subsequently. President Bush appointed John Bolton as Permanent Representative to the UN on August 1, the first day of the recess, asserting that the post was too important to be left vacant at a time when the country was at war and there was a vital debate about the reform of the UN. \nDemocratic Senator Edward Kennedy called the appointment \"an abuse of power\". The appointment is due to be confirmed before January 2007 after which it lapses.\nDr. John Bolton, a prominent neoconservative and sometime aide to James Baker, has been highly critical of the UN and its role in international affairs. His opinions were shared by other Republicans including Sen. Norm Coleman who is reported as saying that the UN was \"mismanaged and possibly corrupt\". He was nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize in February this year by Per Ahjmark, former deputy prime minister of Sweden. \nPresident Bush is reported as saying that he wants Bolton's appointment confirmed before January when the Democrats take power. The present constitution of the Senate Committee is 10 Republicans and 8 Democrats and Republican Sen. George Voinovich had come to support Bolton's appointment. However, the move by Republican Sen. Lincoln Chafee, on the grounds that, at the recent elections, the people had spoken out against US foreign policy, could result in a hung vote. That would result in John Bolton being removed from his position as US Ambassador to the UN."}

One of the standards include coming to school on time and good behaviour for 20 days, it appears on the students records as: \"Work and Study Skills: Demonstrate Care and Timeliness as an Employee\".\nBill English, Member of Parliament for National and the education spokesman for National, said: \"The easy credits demotivated students. Take someone who's struggling with maths and works hard to get four or five credits - and then they see their mate getting three credits for holding a conversation... That's something that children learn when they're 2, 3, 4... It hardly seems credit material.\"\nAll those standards are available to any student who goes to a school which is accredited to assess the standard internally. The standards are not made up by the school but are real standards written by the New Zealand Qualifications Authority (NZQA).\nThe NZQA said, on Friday, that the standards would be marked down as \"special supported learning\" but recently they went back on that and said that now the credits are \"mainstream and not differentiated on NCEA records.\"\nThe chief executive of NZQA, Bali Haque, said: \"Level one was absolutely basic and the delivery of unit standards was a developing process. There's no doubt that you will find anomalies. The intention here is to recognise the learning that people have done, and give them credit for it.\"\nMr Haque admits that this system \"is not perfect\" but is adamant that schools will not exploit the imperfect system as to boost pass rates, unlike in 2004 when Cambridge High School used legitimate standards to boost pass rates. The school used one standard that was titled \"Interpersonal Communications: Participate in a team or group to complete routine tasks,\" and all the student had to do was pick up rubbish in a group. This standard is still available.\nThe dean of education at the University of Auckland, John Langley, said: \"The other standards are meaningless. I turned 51 last week and I still can't gift wrap a parcel - and actually, it doesn't matter. The authority needed to look at what the NCEA standards were and how they were applied.\"\n\"It is better to offer people those sorts of simple, unsophisticated qualifications than not to - as long as people understand the purpose,\" Mr Haque said.\nThe secondary principals' association head, Graham Young, said: \"The NCEA system put pressure on schools to accumulate credits - and the easiest way to do that was to encourage students into internally assessed unit standards. There are some very low-level unit standards which are extraordinarily easy to pass... For people with above-average or average abilities to be using those unit standards is absolute nonsense.\"\nSpokesman, Gilbert Peterson, for the employers and manufacturers association, said: \"The titles of particular standards meant nothing to employers faced with a big grab bag of assessments. It's going to cause bewilderment and confusion, quite frankly. Getting credits for doing the washing or talking to your mate is just amazing. Any businessperson reading this would be quite appalled. We're absolutely sure of that.\" However Mr Haque said that he was confident employers would recognise the standards as basic, and that they were not misleading."}

He believed that this disaffection was related to the very negative way in which many in the Muslim community perceived the country\u2019s foreign policy. This view had been expressed last month by Foreign Secretary Margaret Beckett and by the Head of MI5, Dame Eliza Manningham-Buller, earlier in the week. However, Prime minister Tony Blair contested the strong connection to foreign policy, saying that the problem has \"grown up over a generation\".\nSir Ian outlined where he thought new legislation was needed. Despite the fact that the measure had caused the Government to be defeated in the last session of Parliament, he wanted the extension of the 28 days suspects can be held without charge to be reconsidered. He wanted the law restricting the reporting of court proceedings relaxed to let people, particularly in the communities from which those on trial come, to see justice being done. As things stand, once they have charged a suspect, the police have no right to continue questioning; this should be changed, he said. He also wanted phone tap evidence to be allowed in court and flag burning to be made illegal. Home Secretary John Reid will have an opportunity of introducing new legislation in the Queen's Speech.\nFollowing Dame Eliza Manningham-Buller\u2019s statement that MI5 has the task of keeping track of 1,600 suspects engaged in 30 known terrorist plots with a staff of 2,800, and that disaffection is increasing as never before, it is expected that more resources will be provided to support her department\u2019s work. Patrick Mercer, the shadow homeland security minister said that both the intelligence and security servcies needed a substantial increase in resources. Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown has said that his first priority as Prime Minister would be to head anti-terrorism measures personally. In his present post he has responsibility for the allocation of resources to government departments.\nThe opinion poll findings quoted by Dame Eliza are questioned by the 1990 Trust (a charitable trust supported by the Rowntree Trust, Comic Relief, CRE and others). Introducing an internet survey conducted between the 8th and 27th September 2006, Karen Chouhan of the 1990 Trust said \"This (referring to Dame Manningham-Buller\u2019s speech) is nothing short of irresponsible politicking and journalism which is designed to create a moral panic to pave the way for renewed legislative assaults on civil liberties and can only serve to fuel fears and hostility towards Muslim communities in the UK\". The specific criticism of the use being made of the ICM/Sunday Telegraph Poll, that has been widely reported, is that \"some sections of the media have conflated Muslim respondents answering positively to the question of whether they have sympathy \u2018with the feeling and motives of those who carried out the attacks\u2019 (20% of those polled in the same ICM/Telegraph survey of February 2006 answered affirmatively) with the violence itself. To understand the motive behind an action cannot be equated with violence itself, and the media have a responsibility to create a clear demarcation\".\nA Report from the Joseph Rowntree Trust, by Professor Stuart Weir, Director of Democratic Audit at the University of Essex, Dr Andrew Blick and Tufyal Choudhury was published today November 13, 2006. It concludes that \"the government\u2019s counter terrorism legislation and rhetorical stance are between them creating serious losses in human rights and criminal justice protections...and so are prejudicing the ability of the government and security forces to gain the very trust and cooperation from individuals in those communities that they require to combat terrorism.\"\nParliament resumes its work next week when the Queen\u2019s Speech will indicate what new anti-terrorist and anti-racist legislation the Government intends to propose."}

The Esperanza Fire southeast of Los Angeles and West of Palm Springs, California, had ballooned under the influence of Santa Ana winds to more than 19,000 acres as of the morning of October 27. No time to get the animals, no time for crates or even a leash. Sadly, owners left behind not only their horses, lamas, donkeys, chickens, rabbits, but also their dogs and cats.\nMany of the families who did manage to evacuate their pets found themselves in the parking lot at the Fellowship in the Pass Church Red Cross Shelter where a MuttShack Animal Rescue team caught up with them.\nPam Anderson, Director of the emergency Red Cross shelter said that many people with animals had come and left.\nThe air was thick with smoke, and ash was raining down on the parking lot where dog owners, not able to take their dogs into the shelter were camping out in pup tents and\nin their cars.\nThose who could afford it checked themselves into pet friendly hotels in nearby towns.\nSome were prepared. Jane Garner, a small dog breeder was able to get all her animals out, and had set up her puppy runs alongside her RV in the parking lot. Others were not doing too well, having left home without as much as a leash.\nThe same scenario played out at the Red Cross shelter at Hemet High School. Animals were being boarded in vans, trailers and cars and small travel crates.\nWhen MuttShack Animal Rescue arrived, a small fracas had sent several dogs off in different directions, running out of the school parking lot down busy streets necessitating an instant rescue response.\nThe Incident Command for the Esperanza Animals, Ramona Humane Society in San Jacinto welcomed MuttShack\u2018s offer to help at the shelters.\nRamona Humane Society had recently published a notice in their Newsletter about the newly passed \u201cPETS Act\"\nand warned owners not wait until a major disaster such as an earthquake or fire\nto prepare. \"Be proactive to ensure that your pet will be taken care of.\u201d\nMuttShack and PetSmart Charities set up ad hoc facilities for the animals at both shelters.\nThe Red Cross shelter, run by Madison Burtchaell of the Orange County Red Cross was very accommodating about allowing a small emergency pet shelter adjacent to the School.\nBarbara A. Fought of PetSmart Charities, an organization that works with animal welfare organizations and provide assistance in disasters, provided crates and emergency supplies.\nMuttShack and Red Cross volunteers, Martin St. John, Tom Hamilton, and Steve Meissner helped assemble the crates to secure a safe environment for evacuated pets.\nIt was a great relief for evacuees who had camped out in the parking lot to finally leave their vehicles and relax at the shelter, setting up their cots to grab some sorely needed rest.\nFirefighters and residents reported loss of wildlife and animals. The Esperanza fire burned 34 homes, consumed 40,000 acres and cost five Firefighters their lives before it was contained four days later on October 30. Firefighting operations cost nearly $10 million.\nMuttShack Animal Rescue is a 501(c) 3 non-profit organization active in disasters and dedicated to the rescue, rehabilitation and care of lost or discarded dogs, cats and other animals."}

The stadium is already planning for an upgrade, worth $60 million but that money will be funded from private and charitable organisations as well as the local and central governments. The current upgrade will see Jade stadium's seating capacity grow to 43,000 and if they host a quarter-final or semi-final then temporary seating will increase the seats to 55,000.\nTrevor Mallard, the Minister of Sport, said that the Auckland City Council and the Auckland Regional Council have both been given about two weeks to tell the government which decision it supports. If they cannot come to a decision then the final will most likely be given to Jade stadium, Christchurch. The least likeliest of all decisions, an upgrade of Carlaw park, but that is designated for a retirement home and on private land.\nMr Moore said that he and \"stadium officials had offered Jade Stadium as a back-up final venue at a recent informal meeting with Mallard because of the continuing Auckland divisions over a site. This is about New Zealand Inc, not about Christchurch versus Auckland. What we have said to Trevor Mallard is we are able to put a stadium into Christchurch that would accommodate the numbers they would need as an insurance policy if Auckland cannot get its act together. The Government knows that when Christchurch or Canterbury puts its hand up it delivers with excellence.\"\nBryan Pearson, chief executive of Vbase, the company which manages Jade Stadium, said: \"It was not uncommon for major sporting venues to add temporary seating for big events. London had included temporary seating for some stadiums as part of its successful Olympic hosting bid. It was not a low-rent option, and was a commercially prudent way to marry short-term opportunity with long-term legacy.\"\nMr Pearson hopes that Jade Stadium will not be used for the final as he understands why the government wants a national stadium, \"Let's hope this gets sorted and we can focus our attentions on playing a very major supporting role. We are only a third the size of Auckland, so what we can sustain post-World Cup is nowhere near what Auckland can.\"\nWarwick Taylor, former All Black, said it will be great if Christchurch can host the final even though he played in the 1987 final at Eden Park. Though Mr Taylor does say that an Auckland stadium is a better idea as a 60,000 seat stadium is more viable in such a large population city. Mr Taylor said that he \"had great memories playing at Eden Park and in some ways would hate to see it lose the final. But I also like the idea of a national stadium.\"\nThe New Zealand Rugby Union said that a waterfront stadium and an upgrade of Eden Park are the only two options being considered, and no other stadiums are being considered.\nA lot of people are confirming that Christchurch will be able to cope with the huge amount of visitors that would arrive for the final as Christchurch has the highest per capita amount of restaurants and bars in Australasia. The city also features numerous hotels.\nIf New Zealand cannot deliver a final in a 60,000 seat World Class stadium then the IRB will allocated the final to another country."}

The UN says that it has found no evidence of urianum-based munitions.\nTwo previously unknown Lebanese professors of physics, Mohammad Ali Kubaissi and Ibrahim Rachidi claim that the levels of radiation, about 700 nanosieverts per hour, twenty times the average levels, are consistent with the use of a depleted uranium bomb casing. Military use of depleted uranium is quite controversial due to its toxicity and low level radioactivity. Depleted uranium features in the list of weapons capable of causing mass destruction, superflous injury and unnecessary suffering, passed by the Sub-Commission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities of the UNHRC in 1996 and 1997.\nThis analysis has been partially coroborated by an independent consultant specialising in career, organisation and community psychology issues, Dai Williams, affiliated with the environmentalist organisation Green Audit, with testing done by Chris Busby, a member of the Defence Depleted Uranium Oversight Board of the British Ministry of Defence and a director and co-founder of Green Audit. Williams believes that these anomalies may have been caused by Israel's use of uranium based weapons involving some secret physical techniques, not nuclear fission; however, there are no known such physical processes.\nThe U.S. is currently the only nation known to use depleted uranium bomb casings and munitions. Some observers have claimed that Israel used depleted uranium muntions during the 1973 Arab-Israeli war; however, U.N. observers have never found Israel using depleted uranium.\nThis level of radiation is also consistent with Israel having destroyed some form of storage facility for nuclear material. Such facilities are speculated to exist in the Middle East, often controlled by Islamic extremist groups who (allegedly) hope to construct a dirty bomb.\nDirty bombs are not considered to be as effective militarily as merely using more explosives. Post September 11th news reports about the dangers of dirty bombs have been criticized as fear mongering for fallaciously assuming years of continued exposure by victims without acounting for clean up procedures, or even rain fall."}

Sky, a leading satellite broadcaster will distribute Al Jazeera English.\nAt the same time, Al Jazeera's English website, aljazeera.net/English, will have a new look and will provide live streams of the TV channel, RSS feeds, e-mail, newsletters and interactive discussion boards and will allow everyone to \"express their opinion freely, encouraging debates, viewpoints and counter viewpoints\". Notably, aljazeera.com is an unrelated website publishing inflammatory opinion articles about Middle East issues.\nAl Jazeera claims to be impartial and says that its team of journalists \"share a common set of attributes: objectivity, accuracy, and a passion for truth\". It is supported by the Emir of Qatar, Sheik Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani who enabled it to start up with a grant of $150M and it is said to receive $30m annually from him.\nNigel Parson, al-Jazeera International's British managing director, said he intended to bring home to British viewers what was being done in their name.

The report revives earlier claims of a Papal-Jewish conspiracy reported by some media outlets in Arab and Muslim countries. \nCommenting on a recent private audience granted to Dr. Kissinger by Pope Benedict XVI, the Iranian broadcaster described Kissinger as \"anti-Christian\" presumably because he is Jewish. The Iranian radio stated that \"this is not the first time the Vatican, which claims to be champion of Christianity uses foreign, anti-Christian experts.\"\nCiting a report by the Italian daily newspaper \"La Stampa\", the Iranian radio reported that \"the Leader of the Catholic sect of Christianity, Pope Benedict XVI has called on former US Secretary of State, Henry Kissinger, a Jew who does not believe in either Prophet Jesus (peace upon him) or his Virgin mother, Mary (peace upon her), to become a member of the Vatican\u2019s consultative council on foreign policy.\"\nIranian radio further claimed that the previous Roman-Catholic pontiff, Pope John Paul II, also consulted with foreign \"anti-Christian\" experts, in this case the former U.S. national security adviser, Dr. Zbigniew Brzezinski. Like the previous pope, Dr. Brzezinski is both Polish and Catholic -- the fact acknowledged by the Iranian broadcaster. Dr. Brzezinski's last name was misspelled on the Iranian radio web site as \"Berzhinsky.\" Dr. Kissinger was born in Germany, which is also the birthplace of Pope Benedict XVI. Young Henry Kissinger and his immediate family managed to escape Nazi persecution of Jews by immigrating to the United States in the 1930s.\nAs a proof that there may be an anti-Muslim conspiracy involving Dr. Kissinger, the Iranian broadcaster asserted that one of the most important topics of his contacts with Pope Benedict XVI \"are related to resurgent Islam, which is claiming more and more adherents around the globe.\" Pope Benedict XVI came earlier under severe criticism in Muslim countries for his comments about the history of Islam made during the visit to his native Germany in September 2006. Some media commentators in the West also criticized the pope for his comments as contributing to religious tensions, while others defended his right to discuss the history of Islam. The Jewish-American Anti Defamation League reported that media outlets in Muslim countries claimed there was a Jewish conspiracy behind the pope's comments. \nIn reviving the Jewish-Papal conspiracy theory, the Iranian radio did not explain what makes both Dr. Kissinger and Dr. Brzezinski \"anti-Christian\" and why the popes would knowingly consult on a regular basis with people holding anti-Christian views. \nCommenting on the Iranian broadcast,FreeMediaOnline.org, a California-based nonprofit media watch organization supporting press freedom worldwide, reported that audiences which tend to believe broad propaganda claims are not likely to question logical and factual inconsistencies such as those contained in the Iranian broadcast. Iranian media reports with anti-Jewish and anti-Israeli claims often have factual mistakes and are frequently written in ungrammatical and difficult to understand English."}

However, Brampton Mayor Susan Fennell already has two competitors aiming to take her down in four years time.\nHer first two announced competitors are set to complete: John R. A. Moulton, who finished third in the last election, and political newcomer Tom Argyll.\nWhen asked by Wikinews for general comments about the election, Moulton replied \"I will be back!!!!\" \nArgall, who pens under the self-described \"pretentious\" pen name of T. Gregory Argall, announced his intentions after asking candidates for information, and writing about this experience on website \"The Brampton News\".\n\"This is no longer just a study in sociology. This not simply a game of \"can-I-get-elected?\" It is a serious undertaking and I will follow through if elected,\" Argall says on his campaign MySpace account. \"I was born in Brampton and I have lived here all my life. This city is important to me.\"\nNeither candidate can spend money on campaigning, nor accept donations, until registered for their shot at the top job until the city begins accepting submissions in 2010. This is believed to be the earliest any would-be Brampton mayoral candidate has stated their intention, due to the fact the span between previous municipal elections was two, then three years.\nMoulton received 5.9% of the vote, for third place. Sunny Gandhi and Amjid Iqbal both received fewer votes, while front runners Susan Fennell and Raj Sharda took 74.8% and 14.1% respectively. Sharda had been endorsed by the \"Toronto Star\" newspaper.\nMoulton's message also stated that \"We can not put the environment on the back burner / We have to react now!!!\""}

The man is identified as a Russian spy and has been living under a false name. \nAs he prepared to board a plane out of Canada, Canada Border Services agents took the man into custody at Pierre Elliott Trudeau International Airport in Montreal on Tuesday. Public Safety Minister Stockwell Day and Immigration Minister Monte Solberg signed the document that authorized the man's arrest. \nThis document is called the national security certificate and is rarely used. The certificate alerts Ottawa about possible threats to the country. The ministers of immigration and public safety are obliged to sign the national security certificate.\n\"The government's most important duty is to ensure the security of all Canadians. A security certificate has been issued ... against a foreign national. He is now in custody in Montreal,\" said Melissa Leclerc, spokeswoman for Public Safety Minister Stockwell Day. \"A foreign national alleging to be a Canadian citizen named Paul William Hampel was arrested in Montreal after a national security certificate under the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act was issued against him.\"\nThe man came to Canada several years ago with the name of Paul William Hampel, and is now reported to be false. Officials at the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS) are working on identifying the man who entered Canada years ago.\n\"He is now in custody in Montreal. This is not a counter-terrorism case. More information will become available as the Federal Court process unfolds. Any speculation about the individual's other nationality is premature at this point,\" Barbara Campion, a spokesperson for CSIS.\nOttawa believed the man had been \"engaging in an act of espionage or an act of subversion,\" and \"belonged to an organization that there are reasonable grounds to believe engages.\"\n\"I don't think we're going to get the most intimate of details, no, not at all,\" he told CTV Montreal...We'll see a public version of the allegations that will be released by the federal court judge who is going to be responsible for reviewing the basis upon which cabinet will have declared this individual subject to a security certificate. beyond that, though, we may see things settle more quietly between governments,\" said David Harris, former chief of strategic planning at CSIS.\n\"There are also influence operations where countries might try to influence their expatriates and \u00e9migr\u00e9 communities in Canada. Beyond that, there is a real appetite building among many countries for technological secrets,\" he said. \"They can be of use to industries of the sponsoring nations and these things can have values in the billions for the economies of those countries undertaking these operations.\"\nReports say the man's methods in Canada matched the techniques used by the Russian intelligence agency's Directorate S, which runs the Russian spy network.\nTwenty people since 1991 have been charged under the Security Certificate legislation in Canada. The last time it was used was in 2003.\nThe court hearing for the man being held in Montreal will be on Wednesday. It is still unclear if the hearing will be in Ottawa, the nations capital, or in Montreal. \nMore information will be released as the case progresses."}

Deputy leader, Gerry Brownlee, said: \"If it was a new car I wouldn't buy it.\"\nIt was reported that John Key, Gerry Brownlee, Katherine Rich and Murray McCully were all present at the meeting with Mr Mallard.

I thought Catherine Rich and John Key's level of understanding increased and their enthusiasm was very positive.\"\nMr Brownlee said: \"The [NZ]$385 million Eden Park costings seemed relatively certain against the $500 million waterfront estimate, where the price would not be known till it's built.\"\nThe reason for the debate is because to host the Rugby World Cup the venue which is used for the final game has to have 60,000 seats, all of New Zealand's stadiums are currently under that minimum.\nMr Mallard confirmed that North Harbour Stadium is also being considered as a \"very good back-up option.\" This is mainly because it can begin upgrading of its stadium before Eden Park or the waterfront stadium. \"North Harbour could be called on if you ran into problems with the other options,\" Mr Mallard said, \"There are consenting issues there with buildability and there would still be a lot of transport issues getting people there and there's not a lot of infrastructure around it.\"\nThe decision of which stadium will be the venue of the grand final of the 2011 Rugby World Cup final will be made this Friday by the Auckland City Council and Auckland Regional Council, which is asking for the public's opinion to help them with their decision. The council's decision is the one the government will go with according to Mr Mallard: \"There's no way the Government would override the councils' decisions.\"\nMr Mallard added: \"I love Eden Park, and my gut feeling for a long time was to upgrade it. If you like I've got a romantic attachment, so for me if Aucklanders decide that's their approach I will back them.\"\nThe International Rugby Board also announced the Rugby World Cup will be played around September. 2011 instead of around the June period."}

This is the first French presidential campaign where the party candidates are selected by a ballot of the mass membership.\nFrench presidential elections traditionally involve a number of candidates (last elections in 2002 saw the French people choosing between 16 candidates.) One of the questions is now the ability of Royal to unite the French left. Traditionally, parties on the parliamentarian left (MDC, Les Verts, Parti Radical de Gauche, Parti Communiste) have been involved in a number of coalitions, most recently before the 2002 elections. Unity in government does not reflect in the polls as the governing majority was represented by four candidates in 2002: Lionel Jospin (PS), Robert Hue (PC), No\u00ebl Mam\u00e8re (Les Verts), Jean-Pierre Chev\u00e8nement (MDC). The division of the left in the first round of the elections in 2002 is one of the given explanations for the surprise second round opposing Jean-Marie Le Pen (FN) and Jacques Chirac.\nFrance is a parliamentary democracy, where the President is the Head of State, but independent of both the National Assembly (legislature) and the executive, which is led by the Prime Minister. The presidency is a high profile and influential role, currently filled by conservative-aligned veteran statesman, Jacques Chirac, whose second term expires in May 2007. "}

Marin Soljacic and his MIT colleagues revived an idea which involves a source that creates a short range oscillating field. Nearby circuits that resonate at the frequency of the source absorb some of the energy. The system would operate in much the same way as the coils inside a transformer, except that the researchers believe they can develop sources that transfer energy over much longer distances than is typical in transformers. Technology based on this proposal could mean wireless gadgets such as cell phones and iPods never have to be plugged into a wall outlet. The researchers also propose that it could power micro-robots or other machines that are too small to carry their own batteries. Eventually it might enable electric transportation such as buses to recharge wirelessly through power sources near the roadway. One potential problem with the system could be its inefficiency. Soljacic's calculations show that it is at best 60% efficient."}

Known as the Wii, the system and games have an MSRP of US$249.99 and US$49.99 respectively. The North American release is to be followed by the December 2nd launch in Japan and the December 8th launch in Europe.\nLaunched officially at midnight, more than a thousand people gathered in New York's Time Square to be among the first to buy one of the Wii. In contrast to the crowds that have challenged crowd control officials over the last two days in connection with the launch of Sony's Playstation 3, the Wii crowds have been much calmer. Many observers attribute this to the fact that Nintendo had more than ten times as many Wii consoles available on launching day than Sony did for their PS3 that had been hounded by part shortages in manufacturing right up to the day of launch.\nNintendo of America president Reggie Fils-Aime said that several tough choices had been made in the design of the Wii. The company decided to develop a new way of playing games with revolutionary controllers instead of following the PS3 and the Xbox down the road of stunning graphic and multimedia options. This produced a console with a much talked-about sensor/controller design and the lowest price point of the three major consoles. While not having a DVD player or high-definition TV capabilities, the Wii retails for about $250 while its competitors the Xbox 360 and PS3 retail for about $400 and $600 respectively. \nWhile the Wii will launch with several games available, one of its advertised advantages is that the new console is largely compatible with older games made for the GameCube, giving the new console an instant and extensive launching library. A GameCube controller will be needed to play GameCube games with the Wii. Several hardware items that GameCube games may be expecting, such as the modem or broadband adapter or the GameBoy player are not supported on the Wii.\nAcross the country in Los Angeles about 500 people were waiting for the doors to open at Universal City Walk's Game Stop store. Fearing that the Wii introduction might be as contentious as the PS3 debut just a few days ago, the store handed out numbered wristbands to the throng.

There has been no draft since 1973 after the Vietnam War when the U.S. armed forces changed to an all volunteer army. The U.S. currently requires registration of all males between the ages of 18 and 26 for the purposes of a possible national emergency, but there is currently no active draft.\n\"There's no question in my mind that this president and this administration would never have invaded Iraq, especially on the flimsy evidence that was presented to the Congress, if indeed we had a draft, and members of Congress and the administration thought that their kids from their communities would be placed in harm's way,\" Rep. Rangel said Sunday.\nRepresentative Rangel (D-NY), a Korean War veteran, has brought bills to reinstate the draft to the floor of the House several times. None of these bills successfully moved through the congressional process. In 2003 Rangel put forth legislation to draft men and women between the ages of 18 to 26. Earlier this year he proposed legislation to commence draft military service for men and women between the ages of 18 to 42. \nDemocrats interviewed in various outlets Sunday expressed no support for the draft plan. Pelosi noted, however, that Rangel remains \"a strong voice for social justice in our country\" and his support of the draft is done to make a valid point."}

The book has been titled \"The Hollow Men: A Study in the Politics of Deception\" and it's by author, Nicky Hager, an activist for left-wing causes.\nThe release of the book was supposed to be today, however the release of the book has been prohibited by the High Court because of an injunction, issued last week, banning the publication of the leaked emails. The injunction applies to anyone as the plantiifs are in the names of \"Jane Doe and John Doe\".\nThe topics in the book cover a lot ranging from policies and matters to do with the party. The book also includes Dr Brash's relationship with the exclusive brethren. The books also shows that people within the party, who had denied links with the exclusive brethern, had in fact had links with them. Those people include Dr Brash, John Key the spokesman for finance and Stephen Joyce the campaign manager. The contents page has been revealed, it showed that the book includes political strategies behind the Orewa speech, the input into Nationals campaign from neo-conservatives in America, industry lobby group influences, doners to National and also the election spending strategy that was thought up by Australian advisers.\nHe also said it looked at a range of possible breaches of election finance laws and parliamentary spending rules.\nMr Hager confirmed that the book doesn't just use emails but also interviews with people inside the National Party who are unhappy. \nMr Hager said that the book uses emails from Dr Brash that are non-personal and the book does not include anything about Dr Brash's private life. He said that well-placed sources from within National had provided him with the emails. Mr Hager said: \"[The emails did not come] from hacking into the parliamentary server or gaining access to Don Brash's computer system or something like that\".\nIn response to the book National has begun to attack Mr Hager's credibility. Gerry Brownlee, deputy leader, has labbled Mr Hager as a well known intriguist. \"Helen Clark roundly ditched him over his Corngate allegations a few years ago and it would be interesting to know what she would make of his latest claims.\"\nDr Brash said that it is not expected that their communications with the public would be made public.\nThe New Zealand Labour party is claiming that this book will be the \"death knell\" for National. Michael Cullen, deputy prime minister (PM), said: \"The claims about Brash's and John Key's dealings with the Exclusive Brethren are very damaging. The trouble for the National Party is the book may knock out both of them in one go and the party will have to look beyond Key as leader.\"\nCurrent affairs show which is broadcast on TV3, Campbell Live, has filed legal precedings in the high court to allow the publication of the book. Carol Hirshfeld, producer, said: \"[Our] lawyers are arguing the court didn't take sufficient account of the public interest and that constitutes an unreasonable restriction on freedom of expression. Another key point in the application is that Brash knew for some time that the emails were in the public domain, but delayed acting until now.\" On today's show host of Campbell Live, John Campbell, said that he and some of his bosses had read the book.\nThe injunction stops the publish and broadcast, which includes the internet, of the emails. It is also prohibited to reveal what the emails contain or giving the emails to another person except the High Court where they are supposed to be given."}

Chief Reynolds said the bus driver had a clean driving record. \nMass chaos ensued and Crestwood Medical Center and Huntsville Hospital, the two local hospitals, both activated their Mass Casualty action plans.

Huntsville Hospital emergency room physician Dr. Sherrie Squyres said all off-duty hospital medical and nursing personnel were requested to return to work, and that three trauma surgeons and one neurosurgeon were committed exclusively to accident response. \nAmong the problems facing hospital and rescue personnel was the absence of personal identification among the victims.

Same-sex marriages legally performed outside Israel will be recognized as full marriages in Israel.\nThe vote on the ruling was 6-1 with the single no vote coming from a conservative Jew on the bench. The ruling immediately touched off controversy in the conservative and orthodox communities within the nation. Orthodox community leaders had been instrumental in canceling gay pride celebrations last month in Jerusalem.\nLawyers within Israel say the ruling is largely symbolic. Israel already gives gay couples many of the rights of heterosexual couples. The Supreme Court ruling will now allow them to adopt children and gain tax benefits, however.\nThis latest ruling was the result of a suit brought by five couples at least one of whom had been married in Canada last year when that nation recognized same-sex marriage.\nCivil registration of marriages performed outside of Israel has a long history within the country dating back to a Supreme Court decision made in the 1960s. Actual marriage within Israel is overseen by rabbinical authorities under Jewish religious law and so all marriages within Israel are religious in nature. Not only has this been a difficulty when it comes to same-sex marriage, but issues have long been a problem in mixed marriages where one partner is not Jewish, or among people who can't satisfactorily prove their Jewish heritage. The power held by Orthodox leaders in Israel with regard to marriage has been a point of contention in the country with Conservative and Reform sects for years indicating that while from a legal standpoint this latest ruling may be small, it may have far wider ramification in many related areas.\nIsrael is the first middle-eastern nation to recognize any form of same-sex union, and only the fourth nation in the world to officially recognize same-sex marriages. Israel has recognized same-sex common law marriage since 1994. Homosexual Palestinians often attempt to flee to Israel as they may be tortured or killed by the Palestinian Authority; however, Israel usually does not grant asylum on the basis of sexual orientation."}

Grzegorz Pawlaszek, head of Coal Co., said the 15 missing miners' fate is \"not known,\" but added that \"there is a chance to find someone still alive.\" \n\u201cThis is a tragedy. People have died here,\u201d Polish Prime Minister Jaroslaw Kaczynski said when he came to Ruda Slaska to see the blast.\nEarlier Wednesday, a reconnaissance rescue team descended 3000 feet toward the blast scene, only to retreat because of safety concerns related to high methane gas levels. Rescue digging efforts were also halted because of explosion concerns. \nThe missing men were aged 21-59. One of the miner's family members, Andrzej Pytlik, 30, remained on scene with his sister, hoping and waiting for news of her husband, Krystian Gaszka. \nPytlik, also a miner, said through teary eyes that, \"I work in the mines and I know that hope is scant because that's the truth.\" \nThe explosion occurred in a closed portion of the mine where the now-missing miners were working to retrieve abandoned equipment. According to Pawlaszek, the value of the equipment was $23 million, adding that \"It was new equipment and that is why we decided to retrieve it.\" \nHe indicated that the recovery work was performed under the supervision of gas detection specialists, and that the bodies of the recovered miners were difficult to identify because of the severity of burns and because their ID tags were blown away in the explosion. \nThe Halemba mine, located in Ruda Slaska, has produced coal for nearly 50 years, has been fraught with safety concerns and has a track record of serious accidents. One of the oldest mines in Poland, it is centrally located in the industrial Silesia region. \nEarlier this year, a miner was trapped underground in the Halemba mine five days after a cave-in. In 1990, 19 miners were killed and 20 hurt in a gas explosion, and five were killed in collapse in 1991. \nInside, priests and mining officials were comforting and counseling with distraught relatives. Outside, eight white candles flickered on a main gate wall. "}

A further Cabinet meeting is to be held prior to the publication of a White Paper just before Christmas. The principle of retaining a nuclear deterrent will be put to the vote in the House of Commons next year and, although it may split the Labour Party, is likely to be carried with the support of the Conservative opposition.\nIt is reported that some Cabinet Ministers have reservations about the prudence of maintaining the nuclear deterrent when the apparent threats are from saboteurs and suicide bombers. They also have doubts about the legality of adding to the stock of nuclear warheads contrary to the spirit of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and about the way that the decision is being pushed through without consultation with the Labour Party. Among those with doubts are the Foreign Secretary Margaret Beckett, Hilary Benn, Minister of State for International Development, and Peter Hain, Secretary of State for Wales and Northern Ireland. \nThe only other European country with nuclear capability is France. Prime Minister Blair and Chancellor Brown are agreed on the need to retain a nuclear deterrent. Their reasons include keeping the country's seat at the top table of international politics. \nThe Trident missile system is carried in four nuclear-powered Vanguard class submarines, the first of which was commissioned in August 1993.

The explosion, which was caught on security camera and was heard up to over 25-50 miles away in southern Maine and New Hampshire.\nThe explosion damaged over 90 homes, blowing out windows and knocking some houses off their foundations. Officials believe that some of the more extensively damaged houses will have to be leveled and rebuilt. Some of the buildings damaged included a bakery, boats at a close by marina and the New England Home for the Deaf, an assisted-living facility for people who are deaf or deafblind and elderly residents requiring constant care. \"These people are extremely fragile,\" said state Rep.

Water runoff from the water used by firefighters left a purple sheen on the river and tests were being conducted. However, the water is not a local drinking water supply and the chemical evaporates quickly. Chief Tutko said there was no risk of toxic fumes getting into the air.\nAn Eastern Propane facility was also located near the area, however, it was not the source of the explosion.

The stadium is for the final of the Rugby World Cup 2011, which New Zealand is hosting.\nThe injunction was filed by a group of five Aucklanders who believe that the decision is being rushed. The injunction was filed in the name of a private citizen to represent a group of five Aucklanders. Rodney Hide, leader of the ACT party and Member of Parliament (MP) and MP for the Green party, Keith Locke, are helping the fight for the injunction as they believe the Aucklanders have a strong case.\nJustice John Priestley said that the group did not need this injunction because they could fight the stadium decision in the future by different means. A second injunction has already been filed for two days, starting December 11.\nMayor of Auckland, Dick Hubbard, said: \"The council's advisors have informed that processes have been proper and appropriate.\"\nRodney Harrison, Queens Counsel (QC), said: \"The group that lodged the injunction were Auckland ratepayers, residents and concerned citizens but none of whom could be called high profile.

Mr McGuire said it requires \"public input\".\nMr Hide said that he \"had acted as a middle-man, arranging for the members of the group to meet with lawyers.\" Mr Locke and Mr Hide are working together because they are concerned the legal processes of the decision over which stadium will be chosen and how the decision will be made. Mr Hide said he did not like the waterfront stadium, \"I'm not a lawyer but the legal advice we have had is that the injunction has a high chance of succeeding.\"\nThe two councils, Auckland City and Auckland Regional, have been consulting the affected groups to see which decision they should go with. The Auckland City Council is currently in a meeting discussing the stadium decision and the Regional Council will do it tomorrow.\nIf the waterfront stadium was chosen then the stadium will be located on Ports of Auckland land and they want a guarantee that their running of the ports will not be affected. Denis Carlisle, president of the local Maritime union, said: \"The Ports of Auckland are asking for guarantees that they will not suffer any financial loss from the stadium project, and likewise the Maritime Union will be seeking compensation for our members for any loss of work. The issue was about safeguarding Port of Auckland's role as a major working port.\"\n\"[The Ports of Auckland] is one of the key gateways between New Zealand and the global economy.\""}

One reported case involved a convenience store clerk who, after checking the ticket bought by a customer who brought suit, said he did not win. \nRetailers appeared to win prizes more often than the general public. However it also appeared that retailers were a core audience of the lottery games and due to that, statistically, could be expected to win more than the general public. The study found that the retailers were winning about 2.5 times more than the general audience and spending almost twice as much on their tickets. Retailers spent CAN$23.30 over the past four weeks. The average person spends CAN$12.30.\n\"We are here to make sure that all of our players have confidence in our process,\" OLG chief executive Duncan Brown said. \"Lottery retailer means, in our broad definition, anybody that works for a lottery retailer or is related to a lottery retailer.

I've held off because I've been keen to have two untidy matters dealt with before my departure,\" Dr Brash said.\nThe decision came after a Goods and Service Tax error in last year's election made by the party, \"Although this had nothing to do with me personally it was a source of embarrassment and I was very keen indeed to get the matter resolved before my resignation.\" And recent news of Brash's emails making their way into \"outsiders' hands\" was also a factor in his decision to leave. The emails were the subject of a book published by Nicky Hager, which is expected to be released to the public tomorrow morning. Dr Brash said: \"The announcement of Mr Hager's book almost caused me to defer my resignation as leader. I deeply resent the lies and distortions which seem to have been included in his book and I intend to vigorously contest those allegations.\" Dr. Brash denied media questioning regarding Nicky Hager's book's influence on his decision to resign from leadership.\nIt seems that John Key will be the next leader, with a recent Auckland poll showing Key only 1.4 points behind Brash. Nicky Hager has claimed the information in his book may be damaging to John Key as well. Brash's decision came with the Nationals ahead in the poll. Dr. Brash mentioned that he would remain in politics for the National Party if the new leader would provide him with a senior position following the Monday when he steps down from the post. The decision has left the party in crisis, set for their fifth leader in 9 years. Prime Minister Helen Clark said the National Party are having an identity crisis and is unstable.\nDr Brash regrets that he will not be able to lead National into the next election which will take place in 2008.\nMichael Cullen, deputy Prime Minister, said: \"Brash's resignation was inevitable. This continued instability in the National Party is a sign of a party still nowhere near ready to govern. Dr Brash's resignation was inevitable. But it solves little. By all accounts Mr Key, the likely successor, was deeply involved in all the events that have eventually led to Dr Brash's downfall.\" "}

However they have called for the stadium to be location \"substantially east\" of the central government's preferred Marsden Wharf/Captain Cook site. The proposed stadium has been dubbed \"Stadium New Zealand\" by the media.\nTwo weeks ago Trevor Mallard, sports minister, said that the two councils had two weeks to come up with a decision on whether or not to support a waterfront stadium or Eden Park.\nIt is now falls on the Auckland Regional Council to approve the stadium plans or propose something else, which is supposed to happen tomorrow, Friday. Based on both these decisions, the central government will then make a decision on whether to construct the new Stadium New Zealand or upgrade the current Eden Park, located also in Auckland, which site will also be chosen. It is intended that this stadium will be used for the 2011 Rugby World Cup final.\nDick Hubbard, Mayor of Auckland, said: \"In the past Auckland had missed too many opportunities. We can't get it wrong, we cannot bypass this opportunity. Controversy is a good sign, a healthy sign \u2013 all the major projects around the world have had controversy. Today it's not about rugby, it is about boldness and vision against caution.\"\nAs long as the waterfront stadium is moved then they have a \"strong and absolute preference\" towards the stadium. Neil Abel, councillor, had tried to remove the \"strong and absolute\" remark because he believes that Aucklanders did not get an opportunity to indicate that the decision is absolute.\nChristine Caughey, councillor, said that the pressure that was put upon them for their decision by Mr Mallard was like \"putting a gun to your head.\"\nOther councillors also said that there wasn't enough time given for Aucklanders to have their say and to make their decision. They also said that some of their questions about the costs and transport, etc were left unanswered.\nDespite those setbacks the majority did agree that the design of the stadium should be \"bold, iconic and reflect our first city of the Pacific aspirations\".\nIf the government cant make a deal with the Ports of Auckland, which owns the land the waterfront stadium is to be located, the regional council, other stakeholders, to move the stadium then the ACC will withdraw their support and support their second favoured, an upgrade of Eden Park."}

Electricity was disconnected in the morning of the same day.\nThere were only women and children in the village. All men went to work in town.\nThe president of the Almaty Helsinki Committee Ninel Fokina tried to contact different officials in Astana (the capital): B.\nBaikadamov, the envoy of human rights, B. Muhamedjanov, the minister for\ninternal affairs I. Bakhtibayev, the assistant General Prosecutor; R.\nAliev, the deputy minister for foreign affairs.\nShe had a conversation with B. Baikadamov, the only person she could reach at that time, who promised to communicate to the\nCommittee of Religious Affairs at the Ministry of Justice, the Supreme Court, and the Court Administration Committee which includes the department of court decision execution.\nAt 3 pm representatives of human rights organizations: Ninel Fokina, Andrei Grishin, and Maxim Varfolomeev, press-secretary of the\nSociety for Krishna Consciousness, plus, a journalist and representative\nof Astana TV channel left for the village which is located 40 km from\nAlmaty.\nAll the roads to village were closed and patrolled by police. They would not let anyone go through. The human rights representatives and the journalist took detour through the fields. It was snowing, but they were able to reach the border of the village because of the four-wheel-drive jeep they were traveling in. But even that road was closed by patrol.\nThe jeep was not allowed to drive into the village. The patrol explained it was instruction of authorities. When Grishin and the jeep driver tried to pass by walk they were stopped and threatened to be\nput in handcuffs. And the patrol promised to send for additional force.\nLieutenant colonel, who came with another patrol car, explained that they are not allowed to the village for their own safety. He said that at that time the electric line was being dismounted in the area.\nThe driver of the jeep had his wife and two months old daughter in the\nvillage. He was begging to let him go through, but his request was denied. He was told that safety is guaranteed to his family.\nThis group could still enter the village. They approached it from the other detour road, and leaving the car on the sidewalk, one by one they\nentered the village.\nAs they approached the village they met two small groups of young people who were not drunk but unnaturally exited.They held hammers, big dumb-bells, metal crow-bars and sticks. Two of them politely greeted the group, and one said gaily, \u201cYour houses are finished.\nFour big busses with toned windows and two cars of ambulance were parked at the entrance of the village in the grove. 30-40 policemen stood by the houses, and 20-30 people in civil clothes including\nthe leaders of the district with the Hakim, the head of local executive\nauthority stood on the street, watching the demolition.\nIt was snowing. Residents\u2019 household stuff such as mattresses, blankets,\nutensils cookware, and furniture were laying outside on the lawns by their houses. People in construction outfits (labor people) got inside the houses and started crushing windows and doors, destroying\nwalls. The bulldozer was demolishing the buildings and the big stone fencing with cast iron openwork lattice which separated the houses from the driving area.\nA small group of inhabitants (20-30 people, mostly women) did not offer\nphysical resistance. One of the women felt dizzy, fell down and was picked up by the ambulance. Police was bringing down those\nfew (basically women) who tried to interfere with the destruction of their property. Two men tried to prevent the entrance of destroyers into a house, but were brought down by 15 policemen who twisted their hands and took them away to the police car.\nDuring all these events none of the representatives from the Office of\nPublic Prosecutor were present at the place of the event, even though both Krishna people and legal service people demanded meeting with representatives of the Office of Public Prosecutor who are obligated to be present during this type of actions.\nThe Hakim of the Yetisu district who was personally responsible for this\naction noticed A. Grishin photographing the destruction of the houses using a digital camera and commanded the policemen to detain\nhim. A. Grishin is an officer of the Human Rights Bureau and a journalist.\nTo avoid confiscation of the camera A. Grishin tried to escape. He ran away by 200 meters and was caught by the police. Police officers confiscated his digital camera and took away his journalist certificate.\nThen he was let free, but police refused to return the camera, saying that they would give it to the Hakim. The camera was indeed found in the car of the Hakim, but the flash card and the batteries were\nconfiscated. When Grishin approached the Hakim to find out for what\nreason his camera and his journalist ID were confiscated, the Hakim told in front of the witnesses, \u201cIf I see you here again, I will personally crash Your eyes, even though I am the Hakim.\u201d\nNo one of the policemen, who took part in the camera and ID confiscation,\nwanted to reveal their names.\nMs. Fokina was able to talk with the assistant of the General prosecutor I. Bakhtibayev, who did confirm that he would contact the prosecutor of the province and he would work out this situation.\nThe envoy of human rights E. Baikadamov, who was also contacted, said that the president of the Court Administration Committee Z. Makashev confirmed that he would contact immediately the provincial department and would give the appropriate instructions.\nAll the attempts of the representatives of the human rights organizations to find the people in charge of the operation and give\nthem any information were unsuccessful.\nAll the present officials refused to speak and declared that they were not responsible for the action. The Police colonels would point at bailiffs. The bailiffs did not confirm their being bailiffs.\nThe OSCE representatives in Almaty Eugenia Benigni and Lisa Zhumakhmetova\ndid not make it to the village. Their car just was stoped by police.\nWhen the darkness fell, at around 6 pm, everything was finished: 13 houses destroyed, people thrown to the snowbound street, the village left without electricity, without heat and water.\nThe condition of the witnesses can be described as shock. The condition of the people who were thrown from their destroyed houses to the dirt and snow cannot be described.\nWhen all the 13 buildings were destroyed as was planned ... while the\nadjacent houses of other people who do not belong to the Society for Krishna Consciousness were left untouched even though their\ntitle deeds have the same status ... the bailiffs decided to give an\ninterview to the TV channel \u201cto avoid one-sided opinion.\u201d However no one of them introduced himself. The only thing they could say, \u201cwe are executing the court decision.\u201d\nNeither the Hakim, nor the police chiefs, nor the bailiffs would listen to the arguments that the governmental commission established to solve the issue around the Society for Krishna Consciousness has not yet come to final decision.\nNotice: the notifications of eviction and demolition of the 13 houses owned by members of the cottage cooperative, who are the members of the religious organization Society for Krishna Consciousness, were\ndelivered to the watchman of Sri Vrindavan Dham in the evening of\nNovember 20. The date of execution and the period for evacuating the buildings were not stated. It should be noted that the acting Kazakh law does not stipulate such a kind of eviction as the demolition of houses, and the eviction should be accompanied by the inventory of property removed from the evacuated building, while the storage of this property should be provided is necessary."}

At that point Mr. Lussier had no police record and a connection had not been made between the Pottersville church arson case and the Plymouth church fire where, similarly, a bag of Bibles had been previously saved from the arson.\nMr. Lussier is currently in Warren County jail on a $250,000 cash bail or a $500,000 bond. He is scheduled to appear back in court later this month.\nChrist Episcopal Church serves a parish of about 15 people.\nWord of Life is a large evangelical fundamentalist youth ministry with major campuses in Schroom Lake, NY, Florida, and California, and smaller campuses in 46 countries."}

She was 87. \nKnown as the \"Jezebel of Jazz,\" she was one of America's most respected jazz vocalists whose vocal contemporaries included Ella Fitzgerald, Billie Holiday and Sarah Vaughan. \nA Chicago native, she gained national recognition while touring with Jazz legends Gene Krupa and Stan Kenton. Her first national hit was on \"Let Me Off Uptown\" with Gene Krupa's orchestra, which became a million dollar seller. Downbeat magazine named her \"New Star of the Year\" in 1942. After touring with Stan Kenton and his Orchestra, and recording \"And Her Tears Flowed Like Wine,\" her talent shown as a solo star. Her style became a foundational influence upon modern jazz recordings. \nHer innovative scat style singing and lyrical ballads were recorded on Verve Records in the 1950s. Her colorfully innovative vocal style was evidenced in motion pictures \"The Gene Krupa Story\" and \"Jazz On A Summer's Day.\" \nHaving a close brush with death from heroin addiction in 1967, she also survived alcohol addiction. She completed her autobiography \"High Times, Hard Times\" in 1981 and is the subject of a full-length documentary \"Anita O'Day - the Life of A Jazz Singer,\" which has yet to be released. Her last album, which she recorded at age 85, \"Indestructable Anita O'Day,\" on the Kayo Sterophonics/MRI label, was released last year. \nRobbie Cavolina, her manager, said she was recovering from pneumonia at a Los Angeles convalescent hospital. And recollected that \"On Tuesday night, she said to me, 'get me out of here.' But it didn't happen.\" \nReferring to her renewed musical activity, he said that \"She got to see how many people really loved her at the shows we did, in New York, in London. She had come back after all of this time. She really lived a very full and exciting life.\"\nBorn Anita Belle Colton O'Day, October 18, 1919, she escaped from a broken home at age 14, and began contesting with touring walk-a-thons popular at the time, and was occasionally asked to sing. Upon her return to Chicago, she landed her first legitimate singing job at Planet Mars, a Chicago nightclub. Carl Cons, Down Beat magazine's then-editor, was so impressed with her performance that he invited her to open his new jazz club. \nAs a showcase for promising jazz talent, The Off-Beat was frequented by such musicians as drummer Gene Krupa, and others. During one of her performances there in 1941, Krupa recruited her to join his orchestra. \nIn 1943, Anita left Krupa's band and married professional golfer Carl Hoff. She later briefly joined clarinetist Woody Herman's band, then reluctantly Stan Kenton's. Thinking her style wasn't compatible with hers, she was surprised when in 1944 the tune \"And Her Tears Flowed Like Wine\" became a national hit. \nAnita's fierce love of swing beats, conflicted however with Kenton's infatuation with strident rhythms and novelty tunes, and a year later, left over artistic differences. \nHer improvisational style, and love of bebop lured her toward those with whom she could hone her talent, and by the late 1940s began her career as a solo jazz vocal artist. \nShe invited John Poole, a drummer whom she met at the Club Starlite in Los Angeles, to join her. She once said of John, \"If the drummer is no good, I can't make it. That's why I like John Poole. He's my favorite drummer.\" Their musical affiliation lasted 32 years. \nIn 1955, Norman Granz signed Anita to his company, Verve records, and her debut album \"This is Anita\" was the label's first LP. Though she rarely sang ballads, her interpretation of \"A Nightingale Sang in Berkeley Square,\" was considered so enthralling and fascinating that rocketed her career to new levels.\nHer performances with jazz greats Louis Armstrong, Dinah Washington, Thelonious Monk, George Shearling and others were renown. She became an international star after her performance of \"Jazz on a Summer's Day\" at the 1958 Newport Jazz Festival, which later became a documentary film. \nAnita recorded 16 albums between 1957 and 1963 with a variety of groups, ranging from small ensembles, big bands to large orchestras. Her performances' ranged from vibraphonist Cal Tjader to The 3 Sounds, a hard bop trio. Her first Japanese tour in 1964 was received with acclaim while stateside, the popularity of jazz was decreasing. \nHer nonconventional, self-initiated cold-turkey recovery from heroin addiction at a Hawaiian retreat was successful, and she later returned to work. Her last public performance was at Hollywood, California's Cinegrill Cabaret Lounge at age 83. "}

The centerpiece of this massive development will be a 152m (500 ft) bronze statue of the Maitreya Buddha, the Buddha of the future.\nBuddhist belief says that there have been Buddhas in the distant past and there will be Buddhas in the distant future. The historical Buddha, the one who was born in India about 2500 years ago, is known as Shakyamuni Buddha. Buddhist belief says that sometime in the distant future the teachings that Shakyamuni Buddha brought to Earth will fade away. At that point the Maitreya Buddha will be born and gain enlightenment in order to refresh and renew Buddhist teachings.\nAlong with the statue, the development is also planned to include temples, exhibition halls, parks, a museum, library, and a theater as well as a hospital and educational center.\nIn order to move forward with this project the Maitreya Project has created collections of artifacts that are touring the world. Once the statue is built these artifacts will be housed in it for viewing. \nBuddhist artifacts are usually associated with the body of the person involved. While they can be such things as bone and teeth, usually they are pearl-like objects that are found and collected after the enlightened person is creamated. These pearl-like objects are called ringsel.\nThere are three collections of artifacts currently touring American, Europe, and East Asia. They include relics from the immediate past Buddha, called Kasyapa, the historical Buddha, five of his original disciples, several Tibetan and Zen masters, and the 14th Dalai Lama, Tenzin Gyatso.\nWikinews reporter Richard Kinne spent three days with the relics when the North American tour came to Ithaca, NY a few weeks ago. The relics travel with two caretakers, one of whom is always in close proximity to the relics. Setup for the relics display can take about four hours depending on the venue. Taking it down takes a bit under two hours. \nEach morning of the tour the relics are taken out of their padded case and placed in clear plexiglass display cases. The relics are displayed individually in small containers called stupas. Some containers appear very full, while others contian just one very small object. Each evening the process is reversed and the padded case stays with the relic caretakers. \nBetween the morning and the evening people from all walks of life come to see the relics - believers, people who are curious, academics, Buddhist monks and nuns, both older folks and small children. While the Heart Relic Tour just does deals with displaying the relics, the sponsoring venue can add to the display in various ways such as lectures, meditation classes and demonstrations, or various other rituals.\nThe tour in North America reaches Jacksonville, FL during the first weekend of December. From there it will go to Miami between the 9th to the 11th, and then to Phoenix, AZ between the 15th to the 17th. In Asia the tour spends time in Malaysia in the first part of December."}

Dion entered the convention as a dark horse but surged past three other candidates to win on the fourth ballot.\nThe Liberal party dominated politics in Canada for the past century. The Conservative party won government in a January 2006 election held amid a desire for regime change and a patronage scandal in mostly French-speaking Quebec.\n\"Stephen, if you're listening, we are counting the days until the next election,\" Dion told Conservative Prime Minister Stephen Harper during his victory speech.\n\"What started as a network of loyal supporters and became a movement reaching every territory and province in our country. This movement ended in the great honour you have given me today,\" he told his party's convention after the results were announced.\n\"The most exciting race in the history of our party is over,\" Dion, a former environment minister, told the 5,000 party delegates. \"Let's get ready for the election.\"\nTaking aim at the Conservative minority government of Stephen Harper, Dion told the crowd and a national television audience, \"We do not believe the Conservatives have bad intentions; we simply believe they lead to bad results.\" \nDion's come-from-behind victory was a surprise to many observers and much of the media who had expected Ignatieff or former Ontario premier Bob Rae to win. Dion was in fourth place in terms of committed delegates who had been elected by local riding associations but was able to place third in the first ballot, edging former Ontario education minister Gerard Kennedy by two votes, due to the support of ex-officio delegates who were free to support any candidate. \nRae appeared to have momentum due to the support of several former candidates and was well-positioned immediately after the second ballot when fifth-place Ken Dryden threw his support to the former Ontario premier. The decision by Kennedy to withdraw and endorse Dion changed the convention's dynamic and gave Dion enough momentum to vault over Rae and Ignatieff to place first on the third ballot. Rae was eliminated and did not publicly endorse either of the remaining candidates but the victory of Dion was nevertheless seen as inevitable at this point by many observers, particularly as a number of Rae's high-profile supporters such as former finance minister Ralph Goodale and former candidates Volpe and Dryden threw their support to Dion. \nHis campaign emphasized the environment (particularly support for the Kyoto Accord which has been rejected by the Conservative government), sustainable development, and social justice.\nDion, 51, was a professor at the University of Montr\u00e9al when he was recruited by then prime minister Jean Chretien to run for the Liberals in a 1996 by-election. In a rare move, since repeated by the Conservatives, Dion was appointed to Cabinet without having won a seat in the House of Commons. He won the by-election and served as Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs under Chretien and then as Minister of the Environment under Paul Martin who succeeded Chretien as prime minister in 2003.\nDion was seen as a longshot when he announced his candidacy to succeed Martin in April 2006 but soon emerged in the pack of four candidates who were seen as being in the first tier of contenders with the best chance of victory. Michael Ignatieff and Bob Rae both were seen as having serious liabilities due to the former's several-decade absence from Canada in 2000 to 2005 and perceived support for the war in Iraq, and the latter's past as a member of the New Democratic Party including a stint as NDP Premier of Ontario. Dion was positioned as a compromise candidate with several surveys showing him to be the second choice of most delegates. As well, Kennedy's lack of fluency in French and poor showing in Quebec during the delegate selectio process eliminated him as a viable second choice for many delegates."}

They are taking over from past leader, Dr Don Brash and past deputy leader, Gerry Brownlee.\nDr Brash quit last week as he thought he was damaging the image of the National Party and Gerry Brownlee didn't seek leadership or to continue being the deputy.\nBill English, 45-years-old, is the former leader of the National Party. He was outed in 2003, for a bad performance at the 2002 New Zealand elections, and replaced by Dr Brash. Mr English only managed to get 22% of the votes cast.\nJohn Key, also 45-years-old, said at the announcement of the new leader and deputy leader that he was honoured that he was chosen to be the new leader of the National Party and also honoured that Mr English would be his deputy. \"Can I tell you I think we will make a formidable team,\" he said. Key said the public placed a high value on unity.\n\"The new leadership represents the future,\" and Helen Clark, Prime Minister of New Zealand, and deputy PM, Michael Cullen \"represent the past,\" Mr Key said.\nMr English had supported Mr Key as long as he was promised the position of deputy.\nMurray McCully, strategy manager, met Mr English, Mr Key and Simon Power, supporter of Mr English, in Auckland where they discussed and finalised the takeover of the party.\nMr Key said: \"...It was critical that we proved we can manage ourselves. If we do that successfully then we can earn the right to manage the country. People definitely took the view they were putting the party before themselves.\"\nMr English said that he believes that he and Mr Key will be the leaders for several elections.\nThe political editor for \"Newstalk ZB\" and \"Prime News\", Barry Soper, said: \"The two forty-somethings give the party a new, young look. It is a meteoric rise for John Key. The 45-year-old only rejoined the National Party less than 10 years ago, and became an MP just over four years ago. However, it is still not as meteoric as Don Brash's rise to the job - he had only been an MP for a year when he was made leader.\"\nDr Brash will however stay on the National Party. He is at number 3 on the list of National MPs, behind Key and English. His new caucus responsibilities will be Spokesman for the Security and Intelligence Service and Spokesman for Relationships with Non-Government Parties. His select committee responsibility is Security and Intelligence.\nSince 1999 when New Zealand Labour Party took power, National has had four leaders which has given an image to the public of instability. Mr Key is the fifth leader.\nMr English will now be the finance spokesman taking over from Mr Key."}

This report back date will not affect building timelines,\" Trevor Mallard, minister for sport, said.\nThe waterfront stadium was to cost NZ$497 million compared to the upgrade of Eden Park which will cost $385 million.\nJohn Alexander, chief executive of Eden Park, said: \"This decision is the right one for Auckland and for New Zealand. The Eden Park of 2011 will make Auckland and New Zealand proud. Not only will it preserve our rich sporting and social history, and provide sports viewing of an international quality, our plans will put the Park back into Eden Park.\"\nMr Mallard said: \"The decision on a stadium had always been one for Auckland to make but unfortunately Auckland has been unable to agree to a preference, with Auckland City Council in favour of a waterfront site, and the Auckland Regional Council not favouring such a site.\"\nThe North Harbour stadium has been announced as the back up option, \"It has also been agreed that North Harbour be considered as a reserve option for the time being...\" Mr Mallard said.\n\"Cabinet today considered two options given this lack of unanimity - either to convene a group of all key parties to see whether issues with the waterfront could be overcome, or to support a redevelopment of Eden Park, which was the Auckland City Council's second option, subject to further work,\" Mr Mallard said.\n\"Cabinet decided to explore an alternative stadium site after it became clear - in August - that the cost of an Eden Park redevelopment had gone from around $150 million when the hosting bid was won, to an estimated $320 million. The latest Eden Park version is estimated to cost $385 million. If the government had been advised of the escalation of these costs earlier, then the timeframe would not have been so tight, and the process of evaluating options and consultation would have been much different,\" Trevor Mallard noted."}
