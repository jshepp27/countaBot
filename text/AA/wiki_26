Xinhua, the official news agency, reports that 156 people were killed and 1,080 other people are injured.\nThe riot began Sunday in \u00dcr\u00fcmqi, the capital city of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, in northwestern China. It began as a protest encouraging authorities to look into a previous violent incident between Uyghurs and Han Chinese in June. In the June incident, two Uyghur men were reportedly beaten to death by a mob at a Guangdong province toy factory. A rumour spread that the men had sexually harassed Han Chinese women. According to Chinese state media, police have arrested a man who allegedly spread the rumour. The June clash has been cited as the instigating factor to the Sunday riot, which escalated. \nAuthorities closed down \u00dcr\u00fcmqi with a population of over 2.3 million and neighbouring cities Monday and Tuesday morning. Protests had spread to Kashgar by Monday. \nPolice arriving on the scene tried to quell the unrest with tear gas, water hoses, road blocks, armoured vehicles and armed police patrols. Curfews were imposed, while cell phone and internet services were cut off.\nRioters were using knives, wooden batons, bricks, stones, and were igniting cars, buses, and buildings on fire. About 700 people had been detained by police as of Monday evening, 200 stores, over a dozen homes, and more than 250 vehicles were destroyed during the riot. \nThe changing global economics is affecting the social and economic ethnic tensions in China. One sentiment is that the \"government does bald-faced injustice to Uyghur People,\" said a Uyghur student. \"Uighurs have suffered for years under racial profiling and unjust government policies that have painted the entire Uyghur population as criminals and terrorists,\" said Rebiya Kadeer, a Uyghur and human rights proponent based in Washington. Uyghur demonstrators during this riot were seeking an end to discrimination and not separatism, according to Alim Seytoff, Uyghur American Association spokesperson. More radical Uyghur separatists have been seeking independence in China. \nHowever, the Han have voiced opposite sentiments. \u201cWhat they should do is crack down with a lot of force at first, so the situation doesn\u2019t get worse, so it doesn\u2019t drag out like in Tibet,\" said a Han woman. \"Their mind is very simple. If you crack down on one, you\u2019ll scare all of them. The government should come down harder,\" she continued.\nUyghurs asked for the release of ordinary citizens who were detained.\nOn Tuesday morning a small contingent of Uyghur gathered to urge the release of those detained following the Sunday riot.\nLater in the day approximately 10,000 Han Chinese took to the streets in \u00dcr\u00fcmqi with poles, meat cleavers, machetes, bricks, chains and other weapons. \"The Uighurs came to our area to smash things, now we are going to their area to beat them,\" said a Han Chinese protester. Police protected some neighborhoods with tear gas and road blocks.\nBy Tuesday over 1,400 had been detained."}

Flying from Washington, Zelaya is to arrive in Honduran air space at around 22:00 (GMT).\nThe former president had announced his willingness to return to his country, hoping for a reintegration. Zelaya asked his people to be able to \"practice his rights peacefully\" after his arrival in the Central American country.\nNevertheless, the interim government that deposed Zelaya has announced that the flight would not be allowed to land. Foreign Minister Enrique Ortez said \"I have ordered to not allow him to enter, whoever he comes with, to avoid the imprudence of allowing a president of the republic to die, of allowing a president of the republic to get hurt, of allowing a person to die\".\nZelaya travels together with the President of the United Nations General Assembly, Miguel D'Escoto. Other leaders of Latin America, who had promised to travel together with Zelaya, will instead monitor the development of events from El Salvador. Among these leaders are the presidents Rafel Correa (Ecuador), Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner (Argentina) and Fernando Lugo (Paraguay), together with the Secretary-General of the Organization of American States (OAS), Jos\u00e9 Miguel Insulza.\n\"If Zelaya lands and regards it timely for us to go, we will go\", said Correa. Furthermore, Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez added that \"there is a clear attempt from Zelaya to return, even if they don't allow it, and to restore order in the country\".\nZelaya's return takes place after the Organization of American States (OAS) voted in favour of suspending Honduras from the organization. OAS resolved to suspend \"immediately\" the \"de facto\" Honduran government lead by Roberto Micheletti in accordance with the Inter-American Democratic Charter.\nHowever, fear has aroused that Zelaya's return could trigger more violence. The archbishop of Tegucigalpa, the capital of Honduras, urged Zelaya not to return, fearing a possible \"bloodbath\"."}

Half the mice received the equivalent of five 8 ounce cups of regular coffee a day or 500 milligrams, about the same as in two cups of specialty coffees like Starbucks, in their drinking water. This half of the mice recovered and had memories as sharp as older mice who did not have dementia.\n\"The new findings provide evidence that caffeine could be a viable 'treatment' for established Alzheimer's disease, and not simply a protective strategy,\" said Gary Arendash, PhD, a University of South Florida neuroscientist with the Florida Alzheimer's Disease Research Center and a lead author of a study. \"That's important because caffeine is a safe drug for most people, it easily enters the brain, and it appears to directly affect the disease process.\"\nThe researchers hope to begin human trials based on their two months work in mice. Neil Hunt, CEO of the Alzheimer's Society said, \"[M]uch more research is needed to determine whether drinking coffee has the same impact in people.

As far back as 2005 figures within the Thai establishment were speaking against him; Thaksin used the courts to try and prevent dissemination of negative material, including the publication of a sermon by a respected Buddhist monk who compared him to Phra Devadhat, the Thai Buddhist equivalent of the devil. Bangkokians formed into the yellow-shirted anti-Thaksin People's Alliance for Democracy (PAD) accusing the Prime Minister of corruption. Following the military intervention in 2006, and a groundswell of support among rural poor voters, the opposing pro-Thaksin groups formed into the UDD. Despite conviction in-absentia, Thaksin colours Thai politics, and has derailed efforts to stabilise the country's political institutions.\nThis past week it has been the lead-up to the December 2008 dissolution of the pro-Thaksin People's Power Party (PPP) government that has resurfaced. The then-Prime Minister, Somchai Wongsawat was barred from politics and his PPP dissolved by the country's Constitutional Court following anti-Thaksin yellow shirts occupying Bangkok's international airport and stranding as many as 300,000 tourists in the country. Now the country's Foreign Minister, Kasit Piromya, a PAD leader, is facing pressure to step down for his part in the airport siege and blockade.\nA report in Monday's \"Bangkok Post\" indicates that Thai authorities continue to pursue Thaksin. The Interior Minister said that an attempt had been made to arrest Thaksin in Malaysia's capital, Kuala Lumpur, but he had evaded capture and managed to return to Fiji where he remains in exile and a fugitive."}

We're dealing with some circumstances as they present themselves\"\n\"We've had faculty that are interested in this. We have an issue of national importance, We see a reason why the U of S and the province could assist in this national issue. We see how it could help the country. We see how it could build on the university's research strength,\" said Richard Florizone, U of S vice-president of finance and resources.\nThe research conducted at the Canadian Light Source Synchrotron on campus would be enhanced by a research reactor.\n\"In the case of a power reactor, in Saskatchewan we have much better alternatives. In the case of a medical isotopes research reactor, this may be a circumstance where the benefits outweigh the risks,\" said Peter Prebble, director of energy and water policy for the Saskatchewan Environmental Society.\nThe nuclear reactor at Chalk River, Ontario in Canada was shut down on Thursday, May 14 by the Atomic Energy of Canada Limited (AECL) due to a leak of heavy water and will not re-open until late 2009 or spring of 2010. \nThe repairs of the NRU are complex and challenging. \"I've heard it described as . . . trying to change the oil in your car from your living room. We're faced with conducting remote investigations in a radioactive environment with high radiation fields, conducting the examinations and inspections through small openings in the top of the reactor and accessing over great distances,\" said David Cox, director of the NRU engineering task force. \n\"The unplanned shutdown of the NRU will result in a significant shortage of medical isotopes in Canada, and in the world, this summer,\" said Leona Aglukkaq, Minister of Health and Lisa Raitt, Minister of Natural Resources.\nThe Petten reactor in the Netherlands is another of the six extant nuclear reactors globally. It must also be shut down between mid July and mid August.\nMedical isotopes are used in diagnostic procedures for cancer, heart disease and other medical conditions. When radioactive isotopes are injected into the body, radiologists can view higher radiation via medical imaging, enabling them to make a more accurate diagnosis."}

Members of Rafsanjani's family have been arrested during the course of the unrest, which has been ongoing for a month.\nRafsanjani is one of five high-ranking clerics, including Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who lead prayers in Tehran on a rotating basis; Rafsanjani however has refused to lead prayers for two weeks running, while at the same time he has visited Iraqi Shi'ite leader Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani in Najaf, leading to speculation as to whether and in what way Rafsanjani would move against Khamenei and the Iranian regime.\nOver the past several weeks since the results of the disputed 2009 Iran election were announced, sermons during Friday prayers have been used by powerful figures in the Iranian religious government to make statements of policy. On June 19, Khamenei used Friday prayers to call for an end to protests against President Ahmadinejad; a call by Ahmad Khatami at Friday prayers one week later meanwhile called for the protesters to be dealt with \"severely and ruthlessly\", accusing them of being against God and saying that they deserved capital punishment."}
{"id": "129225", "revid": "39076", "url": "https://en.wikinews.org/wiki?curid=129225", "title": "U.K. National Portrait Gallery threatens U.S. citizen with legal action over Wikimedia images", "text": "The English National Portrait Gallery (NPG) in London has threatened on Friday to sue a U.S. citizen, Derrick Coetzee. The legal letter followed claims that he had breached the Gallery's copyright in several thousand photographs of works of art uploaded to the Wikimedia Commons, a free online media repository. \nIn a letter from their solicitors sent to Coetzee via electronic mail, the NPG asserted that it holds copyright in the photographs under U.K. law, and demanded that Coetzee provide various undertakings and remove all of the images from the site (referred to in the letter as \"the Wikipedia website\").\nWikimedia Commons is a repository of free-to-use media, run by a community of from around the world, and is a sister project to Wikinews and the encyclopedia Wikipedia. Coetzee, who contributes to the Commons using the account \"Dcoetzee\", had uploaded images that are free for public use under United States law, where he and the website are based. However copyright is claimed to exist in the country where the gallery is situated.\nThe complaint by the NPG is that under UK law, its copyright in the photographs of its portraits is being violated. While the gallery has complained to the Wikimedia Foundation for a number of years, this is the first direct threat of legal action made against an actual uploader of images. In addition to the allegation that Coetzee had violated the NPG's copyright, they also allege that Coetzee had, by uploading thousands of images in bulk, infringed the NPG's database right, breached a contract with the NPG; and circumvented a copyright protection mechanism on the NPG's web site.\nThe copyright protection mechanism referred to is Zoomify, a product of Zoomify, Inc. of Santa Cruz, California. NPG's solicitors stated in their letter that \"Our client used the Zoomify technology to protect our client\u2019s copyright in the high resolution images.\". Zoomify Inc. states in the Zoomify support documentation that its product is intended to make copying of images \"more difficult\" by breaking the image into smaller pieces and disabling the option within many web browsers to click and save images, but that they \"provide Zoomify as a viewing solution and not an image security system\".\nIn particular, Zoomify's website comments that while \"many customers \u2014 famous museums for example\" use Zoomify, in their experience a \"general consensus\" seems to exist that most museums are concerned with making the images in their galleries accessible to the public, rather than preventing the public from accessing them or making copies; they observe that a desire to prevent high resolution images being distributed would also imply prohibiting the sale of any posters or production of high quality printed material that could be scanned and placed online.\nThe NPG's history of actions.\nOther actions in the past have come directly from the NPG, rather than via solicitors. For example, several edits have been made directly to the English-language Wikipedia from the IP address 217.207.85.50, one of sixteen such IP addresses assigned to computers at the NPG by its ISP, Easynet.\nIn the period from August 2005 to July 2006 an individual within the NPG using that IP address acted to remove the use of several Wikimedia Commons pictures from articles in Wikipedia, including removing an image of the Chandos portrait, which the NPG has had in its possession since 1856, from Wikipedia's biographical article on William Shakespeare.\nOther actions included adding notices to the pages for images, and to the text of several articles using those images, such as the following edit to Wikipedia's article on Catherine of Braganza and to its page for the Wikipedia Commons image of Branwell Bront\u00eb's portrait of his sisters:\nOther, later, edits, made on the day that NPG's solicitors contacted Coetzee and drawn to the NPG's attention by Wikinews, are currently the subject of an internal investigation within the NPG.\nLetter received.\nCoetzee published the contents of the letter on Saturday July 11, the letter itself being dated the previous day. It had been sent electronically to an email address associated with his Wikimedia Commons user account. The NPG's solicitors had mailed the letter from an account in the name \"Amisquitta\". This account was blocked shortly after by a user with access to the user blocking tool, citing a long standing Wikipedia policy that the making of legal threats and creation of a hostile environment is generally inconsistent with editing access and is an inappropriate means of resolving user disputes. \nThe policy, initially created on Commons' sister website in June 2004, is also intended to protect all parties involved in a legal dispute, by ensuring that their legal communications go through proper channels, and not through a wiki that is open to editing by other members of the public. It was originally formulated primarily to address legal action for libel. In October 2004 it was noted that there was \"no consensus\" whether legal threats related to copyright infringement would be covered but by the end of 2006 the policy had reached a consensus that such threats (as opposed to polite complaints) were not compatible with editing access while a legal matter was unresolved. Commons' own website states that \"[accounts] used primarily to create a hostile environment for another user may be blocked\".\nIn a further response, Gregory Maxwell, a volunteer on Wikimedia Commons, made a formal request to the editorial community that Coetzee's access to administrator tools on Commons should be revoked due to the prevailing circumstances. Maxwell noted that Coetzee \"[did] not have the technically ability to permanently delete images\", but stated that Coetzee's potential legal situation created a conflict of interest.\nSixteen minutes after Maxwell's request, Coetzee's \"administrator\" privileges were removed by a user in response to the request. Coetzee retains \"administrator\" privileges on the English-language Wikipedia, since none of the images exist on Wikipedia's own website and therefore no conflict of interest exists on that site.\nLegal issues.\nLegally, the central issue upon which the case depends is that copyright laws vary between countries. Under United States case law, where both the website and Coetzee are located, a photograph of a non-copyrighted two-dimensional picture (such as a very old portrait) is not capable of being copyrighted, and it may be freely distributed and used by anyone. Under UK law that point has not yet been decided, and the Gallery's solicitors state that such photographs could potentially be subject to copyright in that country.\nOne major legal point upon which a case would hinge, should the NPG proceed to court, is a question of originality. The U.K.'s Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 defines in \u00b6 1(a) that copyright is a right that subsists in \"\"original\" literary, dramatic, musical or artistic works\" (emphasis added). The legal concept of originality here involves the simple origination of a work from an author, and does not include the notions of novelty or innovation that is often associated with the non-legal meaning of the word.\nWhether an exact photographic reproduction of a work is an original work will be a point at issue. The NPG asserts that an exact photographic reproduction of a copyrighted work in another medium constitutes an original work, and this would be the basis for its action against Coetzee. This view has some support in U.K. case law. The decision of \"Walter v Lane\" held that exact transcriptions of speeches by journalists, in shorthand on reporter's notepads, were original works, and thus copyrightable in themselves. The opinion by Hugh Laddie, Justice Laddie, in his book \"The Modern Law of Copyright\", points out that photographs lie on a continuum, and that photographs can be simple copies, derivative works, or original works:\nVarious aspects of this continuum have already been explored in the courts. Justice Neuberger, in the decision at \"Antiquesportfolio.com v Rodney Fitch &amp; Co.\" held that a photograph of a three-dimensional object would be copyrightable if some exercise of judgement of the photographer in matters of angle, lighting, film speed, and focus were involved. That exercise would create an original work. Justice Oliver similarly held, in \"Interlego v Tyco Industries\", that \"[i]t takes great skill, judgement and labour to produce a good copy by painting or to produce an enlarged photograph from a positive print, but no-one would reasonably contend that the copy, painting, or enlargement was an 'original' artistic work in which the copier is entitled to claim copyright. Skill, labour or judgement merely in the process of copying cannot confer originality.\". \nIn 2000 the Museums Copyright Group, a copyright lobbying group, commissioned a report and legal opinion on the implications of the \"Bridgeman\" case for the UK, which stated:\nSeveral people and organizations in the U.K. have been awaiting a test case that directly addresses the issue of copyrightability of exact photographic reproductions of works in other media. The commonly cited legal case \"Bridgeman Art Library v. Corel Corp.\" found that there is no originality where the aim and the result is a faithful and exact reproduction of the original work. The case was heard twice in New York, once applying UK law and once applying US law. It cited the prior UK case of \"Interlego v Tyco Industries\" (1988) in which Lord Oliver stated that \"Skill, labour or judgement merely in the process of copying cannot confer originality.\" \nThe \"Interlego\" judgement had itself drawn upon another UK case two years earlier, \"Coca-Cola Go's Applications\", in which the House of Lords drew attention to the \"undesirability\" of plaintiffs seeking to expand intellectual property law beyond the purpose of its creation in order to create an \"undeserving monopoly\". It commented on this, that \"To accord an independent artistic copyright to every such reproduction would be to enable the period of artistic copyright in what is, essentially, the same work to be extended indefinitely... \" \nThe \"Bridgeman\" case concluded that whether under UK or US law, such reproductions of copyright-expired material were not capable of being copyrighted. \nThe unsuccessful plaintiff, Bridgeman Art Library, stated in 2006 in written evidence to the House of Commons Committee on Culture, Media and Sport that it was \"looking for a similar test case in the U.K. or Europe to fight which would strengthen our position\".\nThe parties.\nThe National Portrait Gallery is a non-departmental public body based in London England and sponsored by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport. Founded in 1856, it houses a collection of portraits of historically important and famous British people. The gallery contains more than 11,000 portraits and 7,000 light-sensitive works in its Primary Collection, 320,000 in the Reference Collection, over 200,000 pictures and negatives in the Photographs Collection and a library of around 35,000 books and manuscripts. (More on the National Portrait Gallery here)\nThe gallery's solicitors are Farrer &amp; Co LLP, of London. Farrer's clients have notably included the British Royal Family, in a case related to extracts from letters sent by Diana, Princess of Wales which were published in a book by ex-butler Paul Burrell. (In that case, the claim was deemed unlikely to succeed, as the extracts were not likely to be in breach of copyright law.)\nFarrer &amp; Co have close ties with industry interest groups related to copyright law. Peter Wienand, Head of Intellectual Property at Farrer &amp; Co., is a member of the Executive body of the Museums Copyright Group, which is chaired by Tom Morgan, Head of Rights and Reproductions at the National Portrait Gallery. The Museums Copyright Group acts as a lobbying organization for \"the interests and activities of museums and galleries in the area of [intellectual property rights]\", which reacted strongly against the \"Bridgeman Art Library v. Corel Corp.\" case. \nWikimedia Commons is a repository of images, media, and other material free for use by anyone in the world. It is operated by a community of 21,000 active volunteers, with specialist rights such as deletion and blocking restricted to around 270 experienced users in the community (known as \"administrators\") who are trusted by the community to use them to enact the wishes and policies of the community. Commons is hosted by the Wikimedia Foundation, a charitable body whose mission is to make available free knowledge and historic and other material which is legally distributable under US law. (More on Commons here)\nMoral and public policy issues.\nThe legal threat also sparked discussions of moral issues and issues of public policy in several Internet discussion fora, including Slashdot, over the weekend. One major public policy issue relates to how the public domain should be preserved.\nSome of the public policy debate over the weekend has echoed earlier opinions presented by Kenneth Hamma, the executive director for Digital Policy at the J. Paul Getty Trust. Writing in \"D-Lib Magazine\" in November 2005, Hamma observed:\nHe also stated:\nHamma observed in 2005 that \"[w]hile examples of museums chasing down digital image miscreants are rare to non-existent, the expectation that museums might do so has had a stultifying effect on the development of digital image libraries for teaching and research.\"\nThe NPG, which has been taking action with respect to these images since at least 2005, is a public body. It was established by Act of Parliament, the current Act being the Museums and Galleries Act 1992. In that Act, the NPG Board of Trustees is charged with maintaining \"a collection of portraits of the most eminent persons in British history, of other works of art relevant to portraiture and of documents relating to those portraits and other works of art\". It also has the tasks of \"secur[ing] that the portraits are exhibited to the public\" and \"generally promot[ing] the public's enjoyment and understanding of portraiture of British persons and British history through portraiture both by means of the Board's collection and by such other means as they consider appropriate\".\nSeveral commentators have questioned how the NPG's statutory goals align with its threat of legal action. Mike Masnick, founder of Techdirt, asked \"The people who run the Gallery should be ashamed of themselves. They ought to go back and read their own mission statement[. \u2026] How, exactly, does suing someone for getting those portraits more attention achieve that goal?\" (external link Masnick's). L. Sutherland of Bigmouthmedia asked \"As the paintings of the NPG technically belong to the nation, does that mean that they should also belong to anyone that has access to a computer?\"\nOther public policy debates that have been sparked have included the applicability of U.K. courts, and U.K. law, to the actions of a U.S. citizen, residing in the U.S., uploading files to servers hosted in the U.S.. Two major schools of thought have emerged. Both see the issue as encroachment of one legal system upon another. But they differ as to which system is encroaching. One view is that the free culture movement is attempting to impose the values and laws of the U.S. legal system, including its case law such as \"Bridgeman Art Library v. Corel Corp.\", upon the rest of the world. Another view is that a U.K. institution is attempting to control, through legal action, the actions of a U.S. citizen on U.S. soil.\nDavid Gerard, former Press Officer for Wikimedia UK, the U.K. chapter of the Wikimedia Foundation, which has been involved with the \"Wikipedia Loves Art\" contest to create free content photographs of exhibits at the Victoria and Albert Museum, stated on Slashdot that \"The NPG actually acknowledges in their letter that the poster's actions were entirely legal in America, and that they're making a threat just because they think they can. The Wikimedia community and the WMF are absolutely on the side of these public domain images remaining in the public domain. The NPG will be getting \"radioactive\" publicity from this. Imagine the NPG being known to American tourists as somewhere that sues Americans just because it thinks it can.\"\nBenjamin Crowell, a physics teacher at Fullerton College in California, stated that he had received a letter from the Copyright Officer at the NPG in 2004, with respect to the picture of the portrait of Isaac Newton used in his physics textbooks, that he publishes in the U.S. under a free content copyright licence, to which he had replied with a pointer to \"Bridgeman Art Library v. Corel Corp.\".\nThe Wikimedia Foundation takes a similar stance. , the Deputy Director of the US-based Wikimedia Foundation wrote in 2008 that \"we've consistently held that faithful reproductions of two-dimensional public domain works which are nothing more than reproductions should be considered public domain for licensing purposes\".\nNational Portrait Gallery statement.\nContacted over the weekend, the NPG issued a statement to Wikinews:\nIn fact, Matthew Bailey, the Gallery's (then) Assistant Picture Library Manager, had already once been in a similar dialogue. Ryan Kaldari, an amateur photographer from Nashville, Tennessee, who also volunteers at the Wikimedia Commons, states that he was in correspondence with Bailey in October 2006. In that correspondence, according to Kaldari, he and Bailey failed to conclude any arrangement.\nWikimedia Foundation comment.\nJay Walsh, the Head of Communications for the Wikimedia Foundation, which hosts the Commons, called the gallery's actions \"unfortunate\" in the Foundation's statement, issued on Tuesday July 14:\nThe Foundation added in its statement that as far as it was aware, the NPG had not attempted \"constructive dialogue\", and that the volunteer community was presently discussing the matter independently.\nDigital Britain and making the paintings at the NPG available.\nIn part, the lack of past agreement may have been because of a misunderstanding by the National Portrait Gallery of Commons and Wikipedia's free content mandate; and of the differences between Wikipedia, the Wikimedia Foundation, the Wikimedia Commons, and the individual volunteer workers who participate on the various projects supported by the Foundation. \nLike Coetzee, Ryan Kaldari is a volunteer worker who does not represent Wikipedia or the Wikimedia Commons. (Such representation is impossible. Both Wikipedia and the Commons are endeavours supported by the Wikimedia Foundation, and not organizations in themselves.) Nor, again like Coetzee, does he represent the Wikimedia Foundation.\nKaldari states that he explained the free content mandate to Bailey. Bailey had, according to copies of his messages provided by Kaldari, offered content to Wikipedia (naming as an example the photograph of John Opie's 1797 portrait of Mary Wollstonecraft, whose copyright term has since expired) but on condition that it not be free content, but would be subject to restrictions on its distribution that would have made it impossible to use by any of the many organizations that make use of Wikipedia articles and the Commons repository, in the way that their site-wide \"usable by anyone\" licences ensures.\nThe proposed restrictions would have also made it impossible to host the images on Wikimedia Commons. The image of the National Portrait Gallery in this article, above, is one such free content image; it was provided and uploaded to the Wikimedia Commons under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation Licence, and is thus able to be used and republished not only on Wikipedia but also on Wikinews, on other Wikimedia Foundation projects, as well as by anyone in the world, subject to the terms of the GFDL, a license that guarantees attribution is provided to the creators of the image.\nAs Commons has grown, many other organizations have come to different arrangements with volunteers who work at the Wikimedia Commons and at Wikipedia. For example, in February 2009, fifteen international museums including the Brooklyn Museum and the Victoria and Albert Museum established a month-long competition where users were invited to visit in small teams and take high quality photographs of their non-copyright paintings and other exhibits, for upload to Wikimedia Commons and similar websites (with restrictions as to equipment, required in order to conserve the exhibits), as part of the \"Wikipedia Loves Art\" contest.\nApproached for comment by Wikinews, Jim Killock, the executive director of the Open Rights Group, said \"It's pretty clear that these images themselves should be in the public domain. There is a clear public interest in making sure paintings and other works are usable by anyone once their term of copyright expires. This is what US courts have recognised, whatever the situation in UK law.\"\nThe Digital Britain report, issued by the U.K.'s Department for Culture, Media, and Sport in June 2009, stated that \"Public cultural institutions like Tate, the Royal Opera House, the RSC, the Film Council and many other museums, libraries, archives and galleries around the country now reach a wider public online.\" Culture minster Ben Bradshaw was also approached by Wikinews for comment on the public policy issues surrounding the on-line availability of works in the public domain held in galleries, re-raised by the NPG's threat of legal action, but had not responded by publication time."}

Lady Downes, 74, was afflicted with terminal cancer, and Sir Edward, 85, was nearly blind with increasing hearing difficulties. These disabilities had forced him to give up conducting. Having no religious beliefs, the couple decided against holding a funeral.\nThe statement read, \"After 54 happy years together, they decided to end their own lives rather than continue to struggle with serious health problems. They died peacefully, and under circumstances of their own choosing, with the help of the Swiss organisation, Dignitas, in Zurich.\"\nMany who knew the couple as friends said that Sir Edward was not terminally ill, but wanted to die with his wife, who he had been with for more than 50 years.\nSir Edward Downes's children, in an interview with The London Evening Standard, said they escorted their parents to Zurich, and on that Friday, they watched in tears as their parents consumed \"a small quantity of clear liquid,\" and then proceeded to lie down together, holding hands.\n\"Within a couple of minutes they were asleep, and died within 10 minutes,\" said their 41 year old son, Caractacus Downes. \nSir Edward was well respected in the operatic and orchestral worlds and was particularly noted for his performances of British and Russian music and of Verdi, conducting 25 of the composer's 28 operas. He had a long association with the Royal Opera House, where he conducted for more than 50 seasons in succession. This did not stop him from refusing to conduct a series of performances of Verdi's \"\" there as he was \"out of sympathy\" with the adventurous production. His approach to conducting was similarly conservative. He wrote \"The duty of a conductor should be to present... a faithful and accurate account of the composer's music as he wrote it, disregarding any subsequent 'interpretations', 'meanings', or political agendas that may have been attached to it by others.\"\nIt was on Friday, 28 September, 1973, that Sir Edward conducted the opening public performance at the Sydney Opera House, a staging of Prokofiev's \"War and Peace\" by Opera Australia, of which he was musical director. Downes also served as chief conductor of the Netherlands Radio Orchestra and principal conductor of the BBC Philharmonic.\nThe family reported that Lady Downes \"started her career as a ballet dancer and subsequently worked as a choreographer and TV producer, before dedicating the last years of her life to working as our father's personal assistant.\" \nThe Metropolitan Police have announced that Greenwich CID are investigating the circumstances of the couple's deaths. Assisting a suicide is illegal in the United Kingdom.\nOver 100 people who wished to die have made the journey from Britain to Switzerland to take advantage of the clinical services that Dignitas offers. British police have investigated many of the resulting deaths, but no family member has yet been prosecuted for helping relatives negotiate with Dignitas and travel to Switzerland. Debbie Purdy, a woman with multiple sclerosis, attempted last year to obtain a ruling from the English High Court that family members would not be prosecuted for helping someone use the service, and in particular that her husband would not be charged should she decide to use Dignitas in future. The court refused as it believed that such clarification is the responsibility of parliament and not the judiciary.\nLast week the House of Lords rejected a proposal by former Lord Chancellor Lord Falconer to allow people to help someone with a terminal illness travel to a country where assisted suicide is legal.

Despite the focus of international attention on continued demonstrations against the Ahmedinejad government, an ongoing press blackout means little of the news, which does arrive from Iran, comes from the provinces which are home to 74% of Iran's population.\nOn July 13, unconfirmed reports began to emerge of a general strike in the four largely-Kurdish provinces in the north-west of Iran which make up Iranian Kurdistan. Videos showed empty, deserted streets and shuttered shops in Mahabad, Saghez and other Kordestani cities. The reports of the strike coincide with the twentieth anniversary of the murder of Abdul Rahman Ghassemlou, the leader of the Kurdistan Democratic Party of Iran (PDKI).\nLoghman Ahmedi, a Kurdish exile and the PDKI's representative to the United Kingdom, spoke with \"Wikinews\".\nIt seems like often, discussion of the politics in Kurdistan, whether in Iran, Iraq or Turkey, is dominated by discussion of communist or guerilla groups like the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) or the Communist Party of Iran. Do you think moderate, western-style democratic groups are shut out of the conversation in the international media, and if so, why? What is PDKI's place in the conversation within Iranian Kurdistan?\nDifferent organisations use different methods to raise awareness about issues they regard as important. Naturally, international media outlets give attention to more militant actions. The Democratic Party of Iranian Kurdistan is the oldest Kurdish political party in all four parts of Kurdistan and the most experienced political organisation in Iranian Kurdistan; we have in the past waged a guerrilla war against the Islamic Republic from 1979 to 1997, and although we are not rejecting armed struggle as a method, we think that there are other opportunities that are less costly in terms of human lives that are worth pursuing.\nWe have always believed that it is of strategic importance to engage in different forms of political protest that are less costly in terms of human lives; for example, in the form of general strikes and other forms civil disobedience \u2013 which we witnessed all over Iranian Kurdistan on the occasion of the 20th anniversary of the assassination of the Kurdish leader Dr. Ghassemlou on July 13, 1989, by the Islamic Republic in Vienna. \nThe PDKI is the leading Kurdish political party in Iranian Kurdistan; in the first rounds of elections to the Majlis after the revolution, our party won an overwhelming majority of the votes in Iranian Kurdistan and our party leader at the time, Dr. Ghassemlou, was elected to the Council of Experts, which had the task of drafting the constitution, as the only secular member. During the past 63 years, and in particular during the past 30 years, we have shown that we act in the interest of our people and as a consequence of that our party is popular and respected by the Kurdish people. Thus, even though we think it is important that international media pays attention to the situation in Iranian Kurdistan, for us it is more important to engage in forms of political activity that are of long-term significance. It should also be mentioned that the general strike on July 13 did not receive any attention by international media for the simple reason that the Islamic Republic has created a North Korea-like situation in Iranian Kurdistan where not only international media cannot gain access to the region, but it is also difficult for the Kurds themselves to inform the outside world about their plight.\nWhat's the place of federalist liberal democracy in a post-theocratic Iran? Should it be concerned mostly with relieving ethnic tensions? Is overcentralization a fundamental problem of the Iranian state?\nIt is our firm belief that democracy and federalism will solve many of Iran\u2019s internal and external problems. Iran\u2019s destructive foreign policies are a reflection of the nature of the Islamic Republic, that is to say, its undemocratic nature. Iran\u2019s ethnic and national diversity holds the key to democracy in Iran because this diversity can function as the best form of checks and balances to decentralize power in the country for the twin aim of safeguarding liberty and democracy internally and to turn Iran into a constructive regional and international member of the world community. A decentralized, federal and democratic Iran, unlike the Islamic Republic of today, will not export and support fundamentalism and terrorism. Given Iran\u2019s lack of democratic traditions and a host of other factors, it is the country\u2019s diversity that can be conducive to democracy.\nWhy hasn't the PDKI signed onto the Iran Solidarity group that was formed in Europe earlier this week?\nTo my knowledge, the organizers of this campaign have not approached our party. But our party has in different statements and actions expressed its solidarity with the brave people that are standing up against the regime. At the same time, I have to underline that it is important for us that our support and solidarity is not interpreted as support for the \u201creformist\u201d faction of the regime. We support the political struggle for liberty and democracy in Iran. This should be differentiated from taking sides in the regime\u2019s factional infighting between \u201cconservatives\u201d and \u201creformists\u201d. Whatever their differences, these factions are all defenders of the Islamic system of government, which is antithetical to liberty and democracy.\nYou first left Kurdistan over twenty years ago. Can you comment on how the situation for Iranian Kurds has changed since then?\nDuring the past 30 years, cultural oppression and discrimination, deliberate state policies to keep Kurdistan in a state of economic underdevelopment, torture, executions, arbitrary imprisonment and \u201cdisappearances\u201d of political activists and civilians have been part and parcel of the lives of the Kurds. So it would be more adequate to speak of continuity rather than change. Furthermore, what is new to the picture is the spread of narcotics among the Kurdish youth, which we believe is a deliberate policy by the regime to destroy the fabric of the Kurdish society and, hence, to prevent organized resistance in Kurdistan.\nHow would you characterize the strike that's underway in Iranian Kurdistan now? Is it closely tied to the movement against Ahmedinejad in the Persian cities of Iran, or is it more a purely Kurdish phenomenon?\nThe strike was mainly organized to mark the 20th anniversary of the assassination of the Kurdish leader and former General-Secretary of the PDKI, Dr. Abdul Rahman Ghassmlou. Every year, since the assassination of Dr. Ghassemlou 20 years ago by the Islamic Republic of Iran, the PDKI has called on the Kurdish nation in Iranian Kurdistan to commemorate Dr. Ghassemlou and at the same time condemn the Islamic regime\u2019s policies of assassination.\nBut it is at the same time an expression of solidarity and support for the people of Iran that stands up against the Islamic Republic and fights for freedom, democracy and equality.\nWhat role should the Kurdish exile community take in the Iranian unrest - is it better to return now and join the strike against Ahmedinejad, or to give support from abroad? If the latter, how can the Kurdish diaspora best help the Kurdish people in Iran?\nReturning to take part in protests would make them easy targets for the regime; the Kurdish diaspora should instead work to raise awareness about the situation in Kurdistan and Iran by, for example, demonstrating, writing letters to government officials in the countries they live in, and so on.\nGiven the Iranian leadership's past propensity for assassinations, do you think Mousavi, Karroubi et al are at personal risk in taking part in protests against Ahmedinejad?\nTo my knowledge, both Mousavi and Karroubi have indirectly made clear that they will not urge people to take to the streets if they don\u2019t get permission from the regime, hence the possibility that they would take part in future demonstrations is unlikely.\nI do not think that the regime will assassinate Mousavi or Karroubi; it would be strategically unwise. It would demonstrate that the regime\u2019s own figures have turned against the Islamic Republic and assassinating any of them would turn them into martyrs and could be used by the peoples of Iran as a pretext to stage violent protests.\nFinally, what's the best strategy for the uprising against the Ahmedinejad? How can the Kurds win?\nI firmly believe that the uprising is not only targeting Ahmedinejad but rather the regime as a whole. That is not to say that the protesters are homogeneous; different groups have different approaches to what should be done. However, it is imperative that all the different groups that are opposing the regime reach a consensus on a common strategy to bring about real democracy in Iran. For this to be possible, a multinational federal democracy must be recognized as the future model for Iran. Given this, an alliance could be created that can stage protests and other forms of political activity across the country rather than the major cities. In such a scenario, the regime will have greater difficulty to suppress the organized resistance of the peoples of Iran, as it did recently."}

According to Pew, the number of Americans identifying themselves as independents has reached the highest level in 70 years.\nRecently 36% of Americans say they are independents, 35% identify as Democrats, while 23% see themselves as Republicans. Some people are abandoning the major parties, re-registering as independent or joining third parties.\nOne of these third parties are the Modern Whig Party (MWP), who have enjoyed phenomenal growth over the past year; from just 3,000 members last summer to 30,000 now. With the Party's commitment to \"fiscal responsibility\" and \"bold social progression\", several conservative Democrats and centrist Republicans have been attracted to it.\n\"Wikinews\" reporter Joseph Ford recently spoke with the Modern Whig Party's chairman, Mike Lebowitz, about the MWP's history, present state and future prospects. \"Our membership is comprised of people from all parts of the mainstream political spectrum,\" Lebowitz explains. He says that the MWP has \"pragmatic, realistic, and mainstream\" approaches to the numerous issues facing America today.\n\"A number of print and broadcast media outlets have even gone so far as to proclaim that the Modern Whig Party is \"potentially viable,\" and \"makes sense\",\" Lebowitz points out. \"We are building this organization realistically, methodically and gradually in an effort to get this right.\"\nHe went on to say much more \u2014 including why he thinks you should consider leaving the GOP or the Dems for the MWP \u2014 in the interview below. \nInterview.\nIn a nutshell, what does the Modern Whig Party stand for?\nFounded by Iraq and Afghanistan veterans, the Modern Whig Party represents a movement toward common sense, rational solutions ahead of partisan bickering and ideology.\nIs the MWP on the left or right end of the political spectrum?\nThe general principles of the Modern Whig Party relate to fiscal responsibility, strong national defense and bold social progression. Looking a bit deeper into our detailed vision, the organization takes pragmatic, realistic, and mainstream approaches to areas such as energy independence and tax disbursement that take into account the needs of corporate America along with everybody else. To this end, our membership is comprised of people from all parts of the mainstream political spectrum. This tells us that we may be on the right track for developing that elusive formula where voters of all political stripes can find common ground with one political movement.\nHow old is your party? Who founded it and why?\nThe historic Whig Party was a dominant political force that included such luminaries as Abraham Lincoln. So in that regard, the Whigs are one of the oldest political movements in the nation. The modern revival was conceived by American soldiers serving in Iraq, who in turn communicated via the Internet such ideas with fellow soldiers in Afghanistan. In Iraq and Afghanistan, soldiers have a lot of time to reflect. We watched how common sense rationality was being abandoned in favor of partisan bickering and decisions based solely on ideology. We noticed how the partisan fighting and ideological focus trumped common sense on not just military issues, but most other issues as well. This included traffic, education, trade, scientific development, fiscal soundness, energy independence, etc. Upon our return in 2006, we initially revived the Whig Party as a military advocacy organization on behalf of soldiers, veterans and military families. By 2008, we had attracted a group of military and non-military supporters to the point where we became a mainstream political organization. The historic Whigs represented a moderate, common sense movement focused on improving US infrastructure and education. In this regard, we found the Whigs to be an excellent fit in our modern context.\nOver the past few months, the Modern Whig Party has been steadily increasing in membership. Around this time last year, the MWP had under 5,000 members. Today, that number has grown to nearly 30,000. In your opinion, what is the reason for the MWP's sudden and rapid increase and popularity? Do you expect it to continue growing at this pace?\nAs the word continues to get out about our organization, we do expect the Modern Whig Party to maintain its steady growth. A number of print and broadcast media outlets have even gone so far as to proclaim that the Modern Whig Party is \"potentially viable,\" and \"makes sense.\" Another outlet stated that this organization is the \"fastest growing political movement in the nation.\" Perhaps the main reason we continue to gain traction is that these media outlets are recognizing that the Modern Whig Party is attractive to moderate Democrats, independents and disenchanted Republicans. At the same time, we are building this organization realistically, methodically and gradually in an effort to get this right.\nHow exactly does the Modern Whig Party differ from America's two largest political parties; the Republican and Democratic?\nOne important difference between the Modern Whig Party and the other two parties is that we look beyond partisan rivalry and will absolutely support a candidate or elected official from a different party if that person subscribes to a doctrine of common sense and rational solutions rather than ideology. We realize that most people are not limited to one distinct ideology and instead pick and choose based on specific issues.\nIs your party running any candidates for federal or statewide office in the 2010 midterm elections?\nOur strategy is to refrain from trotting out as many candidates as possible just to lose. Instead, we are diverting our resources and focus to a relatively small group of initial candidates who bring quality and viability to the table. We are continuing the vetting process for our potential candidates. So far, we have two announced candidates running for office. A well-qualified candidate named Gene Baldassari is running for the New Jersey State Assembly in the 14th District. That election is November 2009. In addition, Paul McKain is running for Congress in Florida's 2nd Congressional District. Paul McKain is a prominent entrepreneur, retired firefighter and recognized child-safety advocate who brings a wealth of down-to-earth experience and qualifications.\nCurrently, are there any elected officials in the United States that are members of the Modern Whig Party?\nWe have some prominent members who have signed onto this organization to include military generals, former GOP county/state officials and current/former elected officials on the local level. However, we do not have any elected officials on the Whig ticket as we still are a newly constituted political organization. In fact, many of our members remain on the GOP and Democratic rolls, which again, is something that we have no problems with as we continue to build.\nWhile the Modern Whig Party's moderate standings are similar to those of many Americans, the majority of voters are wary of joining or supporting third parties. This is largely due to the massive - and often spectacular - failures of the Libertarian, Green, Constitution and Reform parties. None of these were ever able to gain mainstream notoriety and/or longevity. How do you plan to prevent the MWP from following the same path to destruction that these parties did?\nThe Modern Whig Party is essentially rewriting the book on building a viable, rational and realistic political movement. Third parties are actually similar to the GOP and Democrats in that they follow their own ideologies and remain unabashedly antagonistic toward opposing political organizations. In contrast, the Modern Whig Party will continue to focus on common sense, rational solutions ahead of such partisan bickering and ideology. At the same time, we are realistic as to the tough road ahead and understand that we are not entitled to members. This approach, along with our roots among our veterans, has proven to offer voters of all political stripes a viable, rational and non-fringe political home.\nBy the time of the next presidential election, do you expect the Modern Whig Party to be a major player in the American political arena?\nYou never know how events are going to develop. But nothing ever came out of doing nothing and we will continue to build and grow.\nRight now - more than any time in recent history - Americans are disgusted with both the Republican and Democratic parties. Many feel that the GOP went too far in their attempts to legislate morality and that the Democrats are plunging the nation into fiscal crisis. Why should the Modern Whig Party be considered a viable alternative to both of these?\nWhen people take a look at what the Modern Whig Party has to offer, a lightbulb seems to go off. So it is clear that people want a political party that places common sense, realistic, and rational solutions ahead of partisan bickering and ideology. Our job now is to get the word out and show people that it is ok to sign on and support what we are working to build. There is a profound desire for a non-fringe political movement that caters to independent-minded people in a rational manner. Founded by Iraq and Afghanistan veterans, this organization is realistic and continues to catch on based on our recent history and political mentality."}

One man, truck driver Ronald Martinez, has been killed and only 4 injuries have been reported. \nOn July 15, 2009 at about 8:15 PM EST, a tanker carrying thousands of gallons of gasoline collided with a semi-truck from Meijer grocery stores, causing an explosion that resulted in heavy black smoke that could be seen for miles. \nIt is believed that the tanker was clipped from behind by driver Saied Haidarian-Shahri, 27, of nearby Clawson. The tanker's two parts broke in half when a semi-truck rammed into the gasoline-filled tanker and it exploded. The driver of the semi-truck sustained only minor injuries.\nSaied Haidarian-Shahri was a relatively new driver, getting his license within the past 6 months. Reports say he was doing 70 mph in a 50 mph zone, called the \"9 Mile Curve\", along the Chrysler Freeway. There were no traffic violations on his license. He has been blamed for causing the accident. \nThe explosion resulted in the collapse of the Nine Mile Road overpass over the freeway. The Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) has decided that the rest of the overpass cannot be saved. \nMDOT has closed down the freeway between Interstate 696 and Eight Mile Road both northbound and southbound. Local streets surrounding the site have been closed too. This is expected to cause trouble for commuters who travel one of the most used freeways in the metro area.\nAbout 2,000 residents of Hazel Park are now without power due to the accident."}

Willis Group Holdings became a major tenant of the building in March, 2009. As part of the deal whereby they agreed to lease 140,000 square feet of the building, they were given the naming rights to the tower, which had been known as the Sears Tower since its opening in 1973. It is the largest skyscraper in the United States and was for a time the largest skyscraper in the world; though it has since been surpassed.\nSears, Roebuck and Company owned the building from its conception until it sold it in 1994. It is currently owned by American Landmark Properties of Skokie, Illinois. Sears had mostly moved out of the building by 1992, and closed its last offices there by 1995. However, they retained the naming rights until 2003. Since no deal had been worked out to rename the building by that date, it retained the Sears Tower name until Willis Group Holdings negotiated the naming rights as part of their lease on the building. The naming rights did not cost Willis any additional money, and they will retain those rights until at least 2024.\nWillis Group Holdings is a London-based insurance company, incorporated in Bermuda. They are leasing 140,000 square feet of the building at a rate of $14.50 per square foot, and are consolidating their five Chicago-area offices to the new space. \nThough lettering on the building had been changed on July 15, the official change did not occur until July 16, during a private ceremony involving 500 Willis employees and invited guests. The date and time name change was kept quiet until the actual lettering was changed, though the change was anticipated for several months. The tourist areas to the building, which includes a 103rd floor observation deck, will retain its current name, Skydeck Chicago.\nThe renaming has received some criticism from columnists in local papers, such as the \"Chicago Tribune\", as Willis has almost no name recognition in the Chicago area. Several local residents have expressed their displeasure in the renaming, including one who started the website www.itsthesearstower.com. Chicago Historical Society senior curator John Russick has stated of the name change, \"The Sears Tower has been an icon here for the last quarter of a century. For the generation that grew up calling it the Sears Tower, it'll be hard for people to shift and start calling it something else.\""}

A safe emergency landing was performed and the 126 passengers were evacuated from the aircraft without injury.\nThe damaged section arrived in Washington, D.C. yesterday for examination by the NTSB. They have reported that there is no corrosion or obvious pre-existing mechanical damage to the segment.\nAs a result of the incident Southwest have inspected all 180 of their Boeing 737-300s, without result, within 24 hours of the incident.

Where's the FAA (Federal Aviation Administration)? Where's the oversight? I mean, the list goes on and on.

We are going to look at the maintenance records and the maintenance practices, and we are going to want to know if all of these (ADs) were followed.\"\nHowever, the FAA said that the inspections did not apply to the section that failed and, in any event, Boeing and Southwest ultimately came up with an improved design that was up to standard.\nSources.\n "}

The JLG factory announced in April 2009 that it will fire 53 of its 163 workers by the end of 2009, while the remaining 110 jobs will not be secure over the next 2 years.\nJLG Tonneins was acquired in 2006 with its parent JLG Industries, a maker of aerial work platforms, by the U.S.-based Oshkosh Corporation. Despite being hugely profitable in the past, production has been much reduced since 2008 with the contraction of the construction industry and lower demand for its products. Despite excellent past results the new American management demanded sweeping cuts at the company.\nIn the view of locals, \"the company's actions are a disgrace given the expensive perks, such as official cars, for its corporate fat cats, compared to the sacrifice, silence, and dignity demanded by the company of those it has made redundant.\"\nThe management offered severance pay of \u20ac 3,000 (US $4,200), however the workers demanded a severance package commensurate with \"the wealth that their labor has generated.\" Worker's delegates requested a \"supra-legal\" payment of \u20ac 30,000, on Thursday 16 of July the management responded with a counter offer of \u20ac 16,000. On Thursday night the worker's actions secured the \u20ac 30,000 settlement initially demanded.\nInterview:.\n\"A JLG Tonneins worker who wished to stay anonymous spoke to \"Wikinews.\nCan you explain what inspired the workers at JLG to make these threats?\nAfter four months of negotiations with very little progress, we saw the need for a media coup in our dispute. Similar threats in recent disputes, reported by the mainstream media, have proven to be productive. We were spurred on by redundancy pay of 3,000 Euro, derisory in view of the wealth that our labour has generated in previous years and the threat that these lay-offs pose to our families. Responsibility must also lie with the refusal by the management, these last four months, to negotiate an appropriate severance package; the movement in our company has therefore resorted to the media with a visually striking example. Machines designed and built at our workshops were therefore surrounded by two and four canisters of gas. The visual effect was created.\nYou have demanded a large severance payment. In the context of the crisis in the building industry, can JLG afford it?\nJLG is part of the Oshkosh Corporation, the group brought JLG in 2007 because of its very good economic health, 2006 was a very good year, and the fiscal year of 2007-2008 was excellent for JLG, our best figures ever. So yes, with regards to the figures for 2007-2008 the results to come 2009, 2010 are very poor. But only in comparison with exceptionally profitable years! The crisis appears to be a belt-tightening one. This is not the optimal solution, almost exclusively the solution chosen is to lay off technicians and employees at the sites, when they are the least expensive [part of the work force]. Yes, JLG France has other ways to better manage this crisis. This would require that all tighten their belts, which does not appear to be the strategy chosen by the management. Hence the accumulation of tension in the company.\nWhat is your take on the present situation and the rising tensions, is it morally justified?\nThe experience of these lay-offs is of punishment, while those who have made mistakes at higher levels are always protected. Executives with high salaries unfortunately seem to be more concerned with their own careers, to satisfy instructions from abroad, then with efficiency and pragmatism. The perception of supine obedience to directives from the U.S. is difficult to accept.\nThings must change in the future, in order for the course to be corrected to ensure the good health of the JLG company, we are well aware of it. The changes involved, the massive dismissals, give the semblance of a brutal and symbolic pruning of the wage bill of the company, without touching and reducing costs or increasing the efficiency of the better-paid.\nThe best paid ten at JLG France obtained a 17% increase [in salary] for the year of 2008. The case of an expensive car park facility, that it is not planned to be reduced, is another strange case given the current crisis. Bizarrely, on the part of the technicians and employees on site, we are not offered similar increases: we are offered redundancies with a \u20ac 3,000 payoff.\nWhile this is legal, it is not morally acceptable. A company is an organism, it is not just legal contracts and wages that ensure the loyalty of employees, but also the moral contract, of good governance, equity, efficiency. These moral conditions do not seem to have been offered to us. The proposal for a \u20ac 3000 payoff was ridiculous. There is a willingness on the part of employees to work, and behind these to-be dismissed employees, families who want to continue to progress, to educate their children, to continue living in their homes, to live with dignity. \nThe tension created is deplorable. We would all have preferred an amicable agreement from the beginning of the dispute. The tensions are the result of two forces, both equally responsible: \nWe are pleased that the situation defused that night with dignified exits and fairness to all.\nHad you considered other forms of pressure, are others in the movement you are in contact with as \"hardball\" as you are?\nYes, for sure! But we are trapped in a situation of general apathy, low unionisation, and the psychology of a media who are interested only in the spectacular! We first tried 3 months of negotiations in which we achieved almost nothing. In a second step, we embarked on 3 weeks of strikes and a blockade of the premises with calm and without overspill, however we did not achieve much more, all this has driven up tensions\nAs a last resort, we surrounded 4 machines with canisters of gas...and alerted the local media. That the cannisters were empty or full is of no importance: the visual effect was there. Radio and television (and the law) were on the spot within 45 minutes. The big boss in the United States was on the phone within an hour, for three months he had not wanted to hear of French labour movements. That evening, Thursday, 16 July, negotiations resumed and were finally resolved on the night of Thursday-Friday 16-17 July, instead of the original \u20ac 3000, an agreement for a redundancy payment of \u20ac 30,000 was signed. This will cover our backs.\nI repeat, achieving it this way is really silly and a pity. But negotiations resumed and an appropriate agreement was signed on the night of Thursday to Friday. Within the circle of leaders of the company, the faction advocating negotiation finally prevailed. It is a great relief to us all. \nIt is to be noted that no political party or trade union has supported or have hijacked our movement, all employees have remained united behind our DSU representative.\nLatest developments.\nAccording to AFP, the French authorities, after its threat of sending in the police, has announced that it \"understands the plight of employees affected by this recession...\" and suggests that the recent tactics are a radical media stunt rather than a real threat. In an Asiaone.com article Amadio Christian, leader of the labour movement at JLG Tonneins is reported as saying \"It is ridiculous that we have had to come to this to get this result.\" \nThe police checked the gas cylinders to ensure that they were all empty.

The application, made on Friday, followed a 33-to-28 vote (with 2 abstentions) on Thursday in the Al\u00feingi (the national parliament of Iceland) to approve the application, on a motion proposed by the Social Democratic Alliance party.\nThe application follows a campaign promise to join the EU made by Prime Minister of Iceland J\u00f3hanna Sigur\u00f0ard\u00f3ttir during the recent elections in April. Should the application be approved by the EU (a process that involves evaluating, among other things, whether Iceland satisfies the Copenhagen criteria), the citizens of Iceland will have to vote in a referendum on whether to join.\nIceland is already a member of the European Economic Area, and had a free trade agreement with the European Economic Community prior to the creation of the EEA in 1994. According to Gylfi Magn\u00fasson, Iceland's Business Minister, the two principal benefits to gain from formal entry into the EU itself will be entry into the European Exchange Rate Mechanism and the adoption of the euro as Iceland's currency. Iceland may choose to seek exemption from the provisions of the Maastricht Treaty that require a two-year wait before the euro can be adopted.\nHowever, the closeness of the Al\u00feingi vote reflects divided opinion within Iceland itself on the matter. Icelanders have concerns over loss of independence, and over how large their say will be, as a country of just 320,000 people, in the EU as a whole. The parliamentary vote also split cross-party alliances in the Al\u00feingi. Five members of the Left-Green Movement, that currently forms a coalition government with the Social Democratic Alliance, voted against the motion. \nOther issues to affect the progress of the membership application will include Iceland's whaling, and fishing and agricultural issues in general. 39% of Iceland's exports come from its fisheries, and Einar Mar Thordarson, a political scientist at the University of Iceland, predicts that the hardest part of Iceland's pre-membership negotiations will involve the EU's Common Fisheries Policy.\nShould the application be approved by both the EU and Icelanders, Iceland is not expected to become an EU member for several years. Arni Thor Sigurdsson, chairman of the Al\u00feingi committee for EU issues, predicted that Iceland would not be an EU member until 2013 at the earliest."}

The case is regarded as a landmark case, the first such case of its kind.\nRaymond Wildsmith, prosecuting, described the events. The boy had for a period of several months taunted the girl with racial epithets including \"wog, coon, nigger, gorilla, and golliwog\". He had told her to \"Go back to your own country. You don\u2019t belong here.\", and chanted \"White, white, white is right, kick them out, fight, fight, fight.\"\nUnidentified sources told the \"Daily Mail\" that the boy had supported the British National Party, and had attempted to enlist other youths as supporters as well.\nThe girl, who was of mixed English and African heritage, had already changed schools once to avoid racial abuse. She initially did not report the abuse at the new school, for fear that the boy would turn violent. The girl's parents first learned of it when she attempted to commit suicide, in January, by taking a combination of stress pills and painkillers. Her suicide note requested that people not wear black at her funeral. She ended up in hospital, and then \"sectioned\" (involuntarily committed under the provisions of \u00a7 4 the Mental Health Act) to a psychiatric institution for several weeks. She will now change schools again.\nThe boy was found guilty after a six-hour trial. He is scheduled for sentencing on August the 13th. Another 15-year-old boy charged with the same offence was found not guilty.\nUnder \u00a7 45 and Schedule 2 of the Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Act 1999 and \u00a7 49 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933, it is illegal in England and Wales for news reports to identify either of the children involved in the case."}

Five people have been arrested for attempting to enter the plant grounds. According to Mark, while police are now letting food onto the plant grounds, Vestas' private security have been halting it at the gate; food for the occupiers is now being provided by Vestas management after the occupiers accused Vestas in the press of violating the Human Rights Act; commenting on the quality of the food, Mark said \"it's not been that good\". According to the BBC, the content has been mostly sausage rolls, pasties and crisps. \nThe occupiers were informed yesterday that if they did not leave the plant by 10:30 p.m. on July 22, they would be fired. They have since been served with papers charging them with aggravated trespass and are seeking legal representation; the court papers give them until July 29 to vacate, but according to Mark, the occupiers have no plans to leave: \"we're going to be in here for a while\".\nVestas has given no comment to the press about the occupation.\nPolitical parties in Britain have begun responding to the Vestas situation, with the Green Party adding its support to the occupation following the early declarations of support, previously reported here, by the Socialist Party and Socialist Workers Party. Green Party Leader Dr Caroline Lucas MEP gave her \"full support\", and said in an online statement, \"We should be seizing the opportunity to create a renewable energy revolution through a favourable policy environment and massive investment in the new technologies that can see us through a transition towards a more environmentally and economically stable economy. The Government can make a genuine start along this road by pledging financial aid to help keep the Isle of Wight's Vestas plant open for business\". The Greens held a demonstration in London supporting the Vestas workers on July 22. Environmentalist protesters have established a climate camp with dozens of people outside the perimeter of the fence and a mass demonstration is planned for Friday evening in Newport's St Thomas's Square.\nIn parliament, meanwhile, five MPs of the ruling Labour Party have signed a motion protesting the Vestas plant's closure and Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg stated, \"This closure exposes the hollow truth of Labour's climate change strategy\". Labour Party left-wing veteran Tony Benn is expected to appear with RMT general secretary Bob Crow and address a rally at the factory Thursday night. Opposition leader David Cameron of the Conservative Party has not yet commented on the Vestas situation, but Conservative MP Andrew Turner, who represents the Isle of Wight, held a confidential meeting with Vestas management, after which he said that nationalisation was \"not on the table\". Earlier in parliament, Turner said that he found Vestas's lack of negotiations with its employees \"totally unacceptable\".\nLate on Thursday, Ed Miliband, the Energy and Climate Change Minister, published an editorial in \"The Guardian\", writing:\nMilliband went on to promise \u00a3120 million in government investment in offshore wind power production and \u00a360 million in marine manufacturing.\nVestas attributes its pullout from the UK to difficulty in obtaining planning permission for wind farms. \"The Independent\" quotes a senior company executive as saying, \"We needed a stable long-term market and that was not there in the UK. We have made clear to the Government that we need a market. We do not need money.\" Vestas's income is up 59% in the last quarter, although its stock has dropped 4.4% on the Copenhagen Stock Exchange since the occupation began.\nMeanwhile in the United States, Massachusetts governor Deval Patrick cut the ribbon at the opening of a 300-turbine, 800-megawatt capacity wind farm built by Vestas in Holden, Massachusetts. Vestas is a finalist in a multi-million dollar government contract to build a new offshore wind farm to be constructed in Nantucket Sound by 2012. "}

The company said that the protesters have had ample opportunity to air their point of view, and had no choice but to sack eleven of the twenty five workers that they had positively identified; and that given that the fact that the action constituted a \"fundamental breach\" of trust, that the eleven would not be entitled to redundancy packages. A press release from the company said that Vestas \"saw no other choice than to dismiss the 11 employees, who the company has positively identified as the employees currently participating in the occupation of the factory.\" \nThe protesters remained upbeat, vowing to continue their occupation and have called upon the UK government to save the 625 jobs and to nationalise the Danish owned factory. Occupier Ian Terry told the BBC that if the occupiers are forced out, they plan to leave the building \"peacefully\".\nVestas management were dealt a setback today in ending the occupation as Newport County Court ruled that the papers accusing the occupiers of aggravate trespass and requiring they surrender the office they occupy by July 29 were improperly served. The case has been adjourned until Tuesday August 4. In court, Judge Graham White said he was \"distinctly uncomfortable\" with what he perceived as Vestas' effort to \"get around the rules\" in retaking the factory from the occupiers.\nLegal representation for the Vestas workers had been offered by Bob Crow, secretary of the RMT trade union. Crow has pledged the \"full solidarity\" of the RMT and seven other unions with the workers occupying the plant.\nVestas management has also been providing the occupiers with hot meals in an apparent response to Crow's announcement, made on July 24, that the RMT was planning on airlifting food into the factory by helicopter. Crow is meeting today with Ed Miliband, the Environment Minister.\nEarlier in the week, Miliband pledged \u00a36 million in funding to an expansion of Vestas' Isle of Wight research and development centre, which currently employs 110 workers and could, said the Minister, be expanded to employ 40 more.\nRallies continued throughout the week in support of the Vestas occupiers. Since the occupation began, the Vestas workers have received declarations of support and solidarity from a wide swathe of the British left, including but not limited to: political parties Green Party, Respect, the Socialist Party, the Socialist Workers Party, the Alliance for Workers Liberty, and the Communist Party of Britain; the TUCG group, which brings together the BFAWU, FBU, NAPO, NUJ, PCS, POA, RMT, and URTU; and environmental groups Greenpeace, the Campaign against Climate Change, Climate Camp, and Workers' Climate Action, who claims credit for initiating the campaign to occupy the factory. Attendees of the Big Green Gathering, a large annual environmentalist rally which was due to take place starting today but was suddenly canceled on Sunday, are being encouraged to go to the Isle of Wight and take part in support rallies for Vestas instead.\nSpeaking to \"Wikinews\" about the \"red-green\" coalition supporting the occupation, a spokesman for the Alliance for Workers' Liberty said: \"We think this struggle is important on at least three grounds \u2014 it is central to the struggle for jobs, it is central to the struggle for the environment, and it is central to the struggle for rebuilding the labour movement.\"\nPhotographs shared with \"Wikinews\" by the occupiers show the occupiers, mostly young men, talking, carrying out everyday tasks, and keeping in touch with the outside world via mobile phones. The use of mobile telephones in the Vestas occupation has given the press remarkable access to the occupiers and provided an effective platform for relaying their demands and feelings to the media. In contrast, Vestas's designated media contact for the United Kingdom is on vacation. Attempts to reach Vestas Newport factory manager Patrick Weir, whom a Vestas representative at the company's Danish headquarters stated was handling press inquiries regarding the occupation, received no reply.\nVestas plans to close the factory on July 31, citing the difficulties of obtaining planning permission for wind farms in the United Kingdom.

Schumacher is expected to replace Massa for at least one Formula One event until the recovery of the Brazilian driver. Schumacher will get ready for his return using a special training program, checking his recovery after he fell off a motorcycle.\nThe last time the \"Red Baron\" drove the Ferrari car was more than a year ago, in April 2008. If Schumacher starts in Valencia, it would be his first GP with Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen as his team mate.\nMassa and Schumacher were team mates during the latter's last season and the two are said to be close friends. Massa was in a medically induced coma for several days but took his first steps today and can speak coherently; it was also confirmed today that he can still see out of both eyes. Concern does still remain about potential damage to his left eye. Massa was due to leave intensive care Wednesday and may be walking fully within ten days, although doctors remain cautious in their outlook for the Brazilian, who was runner-up in last year's season.\nThere were different speculations about Massa's replacement: most notable and curious was that the double world championship winner Fernando Alonso was to negotiate with Ferrari after the Renault team was penalized to skip the GP on Alonso's home soil. Alonso was out of the recent Hungarian GP just after the first pit-stop cause of a loose wheel nut of the right front wheel. This incident not only stripped Renault of the possible podium finish, but also caused that penalty. To note, it was also the Hungarian GP of 2006 when Alonso was in the lead for most of the race, but ended it right after his pit-stop because off a badly attached right front wheel. That race was unexpectedly won by Jenson Button, who is now the championship leader.\nIn other news related to Formula One BMW Sauber announced plans to retire from the sport at the end of this season. FOTA says it will try to help the team to stay in Formula One, which could possibly mean moves similar to those when Honda was withdrawn from Formula One at the end of the previous season.\nSources.\n "}

According to a report by the local newspaper the \"Isle of Wight County Press\", cheques which employees had been expecting today did not arrive; instead, workers who contacted Vestas management were told they would not receive payment until an interview process had been completed, and that if they began new jobs before the interview process was over they would not receive their money. However, according to \"Ventnorblog\", a local Isle of Wight blog which has been following the Vestas closure closely, the layoff process was being delayed because a majority of the Vestas employees were refusing to agree to the management's redundancy plan.\nThe delay of the closure allows more time for the negotiation of potential solutions for the Newport plant to remain open. The Vestas occupiers and labour groups continue to favour nationalisation of the plant, with Socialist Party spokesman Nick Chaffey saying: In addition to the Vestas occupiers' proposal that the factory be nationalised, Caroline Lucas, the MEP for South East England and a member of the Green Party, has proposed that Vestas employees should form a workers' co-operative with government aid in order to keep the plant running. The Tory-dominated Isle of Wight Council has unanimously endorsed a resolution saying that the plant should stay open, and has called for new investors to take the Vestas plant over, as was done at a smaller Vestas plant in Scotland recently.\nThe news of the delay comes as workers at the plant accused Vestas management of harassing the families of the 24 remaining occupiers of the plant. Families of some occupiers were served with legal papers at their homes. One of the occupiers, Luke Paxton, left the factory on Thursday night in order to be re-united with his family; Paxton was checked for malnutrition and low blood sugar by paramedics but was not hospitalized, instead opting to go home. Paxton complained that Vestas management, while now providing hot food to the occupiers, were still under-feeding them; the RMT, which is providing legal aid to the Vestas workers, has accused Vestas management of violating the Human Rights Act by attempting to \"starve the workers at Vestas into submission\".\nProtesters in fancy dress were successful in sending food into the plant yesterday. Protesters dressed as a fantasy wizard and can-can dancers distracted police and company security guarding the fence which has been erected around the site while other protesters flung a bag of food and an electric kettle onto the balcony outside the office which has served as the occupiers' home base inside the factory. No arrests were made but the protesters were removed from the factory grounds.\nRequests for comment from Vestas management received no reply."}

His success as a manager has been put down to a great tactical brain and the ability to get the best out of his players, not least through his respect and generosity of spirit towards them.\nRobson will be remembered for his humour, his integrity, and his love of a game that he relished from childhood visits to his beloved Newcastle, a team he was later to manage.

Clearly, it appeared he wanted people to think that's what he had,\" said Paul Browne, a public relations officer for the New York Police Department. Police also confiscated a plane ticket which was valid for travel from NYC to Oakland, California via United Airlines. Authorities say he has relatives in California. Other personal items were also recovered from the bag, according to CNN.\nAuthorities continued to evacuate the terminal even after McGann was arrested and began to search the area. Authorities closed main roads to the airport and canceled or delayed flights while the search was conducted. After a four hour search that found nothing threatening, authorities began to reopen the terminal.\nAccording to the NYC District Attorneys Office, McGann is being charged with placing a false bomb or hazardous substance in the first degree, making terrorist threats, and placing a false bomb or hazardous substance in a transportation facility. Authorities say McGann has lived on the streets of NYC for at least one year, and has been arrested at least three times in that period. CNN states that McGann's last arrest was in June of this year. He was charged with resisting arrest and tampering with police evidence."}

Speicher, a Captain in the United States Navy, was flying over Iraq on January 17, 1991, when the Gulf War began. That night, his plane was shot down and he disappeared.\nAfter the crash, there had been much confusion about the status of the downed pilot. Speicher had originally been declared dead by the Army, but since there were no remains found, the Pentagon eventually declared Speicher missing in action. After this, his official status was slightly changed, and was missing-captured, then changed back to missing in action again until today's discovery.\nOnce the current war in Iraq began, searches for Speicher's body began again. In 2003 and 2005, Army members searched a prison in Iraq and a graveyard in Baghdad, respectively, but found no definitive proof of any remains at those locations.\nLast month, Army officials stated that an Iraqi citizen gave new information possibly leading to the remains of Speicher's body. This led a group of Marines into Iraq's province of Anbar, where more citizens told them that the remains were buried after the crash. The Marines were directed to what was believed to be the site of the crash, and found Speicher's remains there. According to the Pentagon, \"One of these Iraqi citizens stated that they were present when Captain Speicher was found dead at the crash site by Bedouins and his remains buried.\" Speicher was awarded the rank of captain posthumously.\nThe remains were identified by the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology, where a jaw bone was traced to Speicher. \"I am...extremely grateful to all those who have worked so tirelessly over the last 18 years to bring Capt. Speicher home,\" said US Navy Secretary Ray Mabus."}

This morning, the sixteen remaining occupiers were told to prepare a list of items for future deliveries. But, according to \"Mark\", an occupier in the Vestas plant, this afternoon Vestas management reversed their decision, terming the August 1 food delivery a one-time \"goodwill gesture\" and saying food would no longer be allowed in. The food delivery followed a formal complaint by the RMT that denying the occupiers food was a violation of their human rights. The people inside the factory have been conducting their occupation since July 20, in protest against the closure of the factory, which produces wind turbine blades for the generation of wind power, and the loss of 625 jobs in the Isle of Wight and nearby areas.\nMark went on to praise the \"brave people\" who have circumvented the security ring around the plant in order to get food and other items to the occupiers. An electric kettle thrown at the end of a rope up to the occupiers is said to be working well. Mark also noted that Louise Christian, a prominent British human rights lawyer, is now representing the Vestas occupiers. \nWhile the number of occupiers at the Vestas plant \u2014 originally nearly thirty, now only sixteen \u2014 have dwindled, Mark says the ones who remain are \"very determined\" and furthermore hold no ill will toward their co-workers who have left the occupation. In particular, the occupiers offered sympathy for Luke Paxton, who they say left the occupation due to a combination of personal issues and malnutrition brought on by the deprivation of food. Paxton, Mark said, has the remaining occupiers' \"full support\" and continues to campaign for the Vestas workers.\nMark also clarified the origins of the occupation. In contrast to claims that green socialist group Workers' Climate Action were behind the occupation, Mark presented a more nuanced picture: the Vestas workers' initial contacts were with veterans of the occupation of Visteon's auto parts plants, with the AWL, SWP and Socialist Party becoming involved later with \"quite a big involvement\" from all groups. Members of Workers' Climate Action attended Vestas workers' meetings and gave their opinions, but, Mark says, a committee organised by the workers and composed of workers was making all the decisions.\nMark also strongly rejected the support of Solidarity, a \"nationalist trade union\" closely associated with the BNP. In a July 24 statement, Solidarity backed the Vestas workers, with union executive member David Kerr saying \"We are behind the Vestas workers 100 per cent. British jobs must be protected.\" Mark, in reply, told \"Wikinews\": \"We do not want their support...they go against a lot of the things people believe in here. We have Polish workers with us. They're our friends.\"\nMost of the Vestas occupiers remain independent of trade unions, with only three of the sixteen people inside being members of any union.\nMark closed with a message of solidarity with the occupiers of two Thomas Cook branches in Dublin, Ireland, whose employees began a sit-in at their offices on Friday after the announcement of surprise closures. \"We fully support what you're doing. Don't back down...do not be pushed around, do not be intimidated\".\nThe Vestas occupiers have also exchanged messages of solidarity with SsangYong Motor Company in South Korea. Workers at SsangYong have been occupying their factory since May 22 in protest against a 36% cut in employees there.\nThe occupation continues accompanied by a warning of increased union unrest in Britain. Neil O'Brien of centre-right think tank Policy Exchange told \"The Daily Telegraph\" that, while labour unrest had increased, the current state of affairs is \"nothing compared to what is going to happen once the brakes are slammed on public spending.\""}

On Friday, July 31, 40 employees at the Thomas Cook store in Grafton Street began an occupation protest after the sudden announcement of the store's immediate closure; workers at the store had previously been told, when the closures were announced on May 12, that the businesses would remain open until September 6. The day after, employees at the Thomas Cook-owned Direct Holidays store in nearby Talbot Street began their own occupation. A third Thomas Cook store in the capital, in North Earl Street, closed without incident; according to one employee who spoke to \"Wikinews\", this is because the North Earl Street store was closed up and stripped out while employees were at home, leaving the workers to find an empty space instead of an office when they arrived for work the next morning.\nEmployees are demanding an improved redundancy package from Thomas Cook and allege a string of abuses by management. Thomas Cook management has offered the employees five weeks' redundancy pay for every year worked at the company, in excess of the minimum two weeks' pay per year worked required by Irish employment law, and says that the Grafton Street location had been losing money for five years. Employees, demanding eight weeks' pay, counter that the company realised a profit of \u00a3400 million in the past fiscal year, of which \u20ac4 million originated from Ireland; and that Thomas Cook's UK &amp; Ireland chief, Manny Fontenla-Novoa, was given a bonus of \u20ac7 million earlier this year. 60 jobs would be lost in the closure of the two stores, which constitute all of Thomas Cook's retail operation in the Republic of Ireland; a further 17 jobs were lost in the closure of the North Earl Street store.\nBefore the occupations began, workers at Thomas Cook's locations, who are members of trade union the Transport Salaried Staffs' Association (TSSA) had voted unanimously to strike, alleging that the closures were being done without sufficient consultation of staff by Thomas Cook management. Caroline Cullen, accounts assistant and TSSA staff representative at the Grafton Street location, characterises the behaviour of Thomas Cook management as \"intimidation\". When the consultation period had finished, she said, Thomas Cook management sent Simon Robinson, an executive director of the company, and a male colleague of his to close the office. The presence of the Thomas Cook executives, two high-ranking, business-suited men, in an office where forty-two of forty-four employees are women is itself intimidating, Cullen asserts; she says that Robinson furthermore attempted to \"bully\" the employees into accepting the five-week redundancy offer by saying that if they did not accept, they would receive only the statutory minimum. \"You cannot live on 5 weeks\", says Cullen. \"Travel agents are closing every week. There's a hiring freeze at the banks. There are no jobs out there...We need 8 weeks to live on for the next two years while we look for jobs.\" The extra three weeks' redundancy pay would, she estimates, cost Thomas Cook \u20ac400,000. \nA series of TSSA demonstrations against Thomas Cook took place throughout July. Trade union Unite in Ireland has offered its support for the occupiers and says it will take place in demonstrations scheduled for Monday morning.\nThomas Cook has accused the TSSA of making use of \"dirty tactics\", according to a statement from Thomas Cook UK &amp; Ireland CEO Pete Constanti. A court order has been delivered to the Grafton Street office requiring the occupiers to turn the keys over to Thomas Cook management. The TSSA, meanwhile, says that Thomas Cook is \"riding roughshod over the right to take industrial action by marching staff into a room and telling them they are going to close immediately\".\nCullen says that the occupation began spontaneously. \"We didn't think it would go so far\", she told \"Wikinews\", but when the closure of the office was announced, the staff \"opened the windows and started screaming, 'we're not moving, we're not moving'. We haven't moved since.\"\nMonday, August 3 is a bank holiday in Ireland. Both sides in the dispute have delivered ultimata: Thomas Cook management demands that all staff return to work on Tuesday morning as usual or else the offer of five weeks' pay will be reduced to the statutory two weeks' pay, while the TSSA says that if Thomas Cook management do not produce a better redundancy offer by Tuesday then the business will face a boycott by the TSSA's 800,000 members.\nIreland's Socialist Party and Dublin MEP Joe Higgins have declared their support for the Thomas Cook occupiers, with a press release on Higgins' official webpage saying Socialist Party members have been leafletting Dublin over the weekend promoting demonstrations in support of the Thomas Cook employees. The smaller Socialist Workers Party has also declared its support and conducted demonstrations for the occupiers.\nCullen said that the support of the Dublin community has been \"absolutely fantastic\". People are bringing the occupiers fresh-baked scones and cakes and donating money, while morale inside the occupied store is \"brilliant\". In contrast to the occupation at Vestas in England, where employees have been inside the factory continuously for two weeks, Thomas Cook employees have a chance to go home for a few hours or sleep in one of five rooms at a nearby hotel, although many do sleep in the office overnight. Nearby businesses are providing the occupiers with food at discount prices and, again in contrast to Vestas, the police and security are not interfering with the arrival of food and drink. Thomas Cook management have cut off telephone and internet access to at least some of the affected offices, but employees stay in touch with the outside world via their personal mobile telephones.\nCullen said that a chance for a peaceful resolution to the situation, without the involvement of the Gardai, was up to Thomas Cook management. \"Thomas Cook have the chance to come to the table and talk to us. It's in their hands, they still have the chance to come back.\"\nPauline McManigan, a TSSA member and employee at Thomas Cook subsidiary Direct Holidays' shop in Talbot Street, echoed Cullen's sentiments. \"John Kinnane [Thomas Cook's managing director for Direct Holidays] has made things extremely difficult for all staff. He has intimidated staff, bullied staff and used abusive language toward female staff\", telling one employee today to \"fuck off\" in response to a query. Kinnane refused to recognise the TSSA as representing the Direct Holidays staff; without union representation, Direct Holidays staff \"were not in any position to consult with senior managers who had their own hidden agenda and proved this when they closed the consultation down when staff said there were other matters that needed to be discussed.\" Kinnane, she said, made threats similar to Robinson's in order to get employees to vote for the five-week redundancy package.\nMcManigan says that Kinnane has demanded Direct Holidays' staff return to work on Tuesday as normal. \"That's not gonna happen\", she replies, noting that the Direct Holidays staff did not trust Thomas Cook management not to close and strip out the store while the employees were not present. McManigan gave the following statement: "}

Initially it was claimed by the police that Tomlinson had had no contact with the police, that he had collapsed most probably because of stress and exhaustion, and that protesters had attacked police officers trying to give him first aid. The first of two postmortems concluded that Tomlinson had died of a heart attack.\nFollowing the publication of the postmortem, an American tourist handed over film footage of the moments leading up to Ian Tomlinson's death to \"The Guardian\" newspaper. This footage showed a police constable of the Territorial Support Group striking Tomlinson across the legs with his baton before pushing him to the ground. The Guardian story prompted other news organisations including Channel 4 to review their own recordings of the protest. The retrieved footage from a number of sources and the testimony of witnesses produced evidence that contradicted the veracity of all aspects of the police version of events.\nSubsequent to these revelations a second postmortem was held, this second postmortem concluding that internal injuries sustained as a result of his fall were the most likely cause of Tomlinson's death.\nA request was made by the police service for the police constable filmed to make himself known, an individual came forward and was questioned under caution. He remains suspended from duty."}

Due to the large number of people trapped under the stage the evidence had to be moved for rescue operations. \nThe stage collapsed shortly before 6:00 p.m. local time on Saturday killing 35-year-old Donna Moore, who was attending the festival from Lloydminster. Premier Global Productions supplies the stage for the event, which are transported from venue to venue in sections via three semi trailers. \"It's their stage. In fact, I know this stage has been used by Paul McCartney, it's been used by Metallica, and by Tim McGraw on tour.\" said Larry Werner the producer from Panhandle Productions.\nThe stage is suspected to have been brought down by a phenomenon called \"plough wind\", which produces winds similar to a tornado. This particular front hit speeds greater than 100 km/hr (62 mi/hr). A plough wind travels in narrow straight line paths rather than in circular formations, but causes damage similar to that inflicted by a tornado.\nAlberta Municipal Affairs has initiated their investigation into the engineering specifications of the stage and emergency procedures.

The American Red Cross reported that they were deploying a disaster recovery team to the area, and officials have been advising residents of the storm.

Rigby was examined at a local hospital after the jump but was found to be in good condition and released. The six were processed by police but not arrested.\nThe six, who as part of a group of around 25 entered the factory on the evening July 20, had been conducting their occupation in a bid to get the government to nationalise the factory. Despite rising profits and rising orders, Vestas has decided to close their production facilities in the United Kingdom and most of their facilities in Denmark, at a cost of 1900 jobs, in order to concentrate on growth in North and South America and in Asia. The Vestas factory in Newport does not produce blades for the UK market and the company has refused both a \u00a36 million grant and offers from the government to assist the company in re-tooling the plant for production of British blades.\nThe company, in turn, blames the British government for making it too hard to obtain planning permission for on-shore wind farms. A Vestas spokesman, commenting to the BBC about the end of the occupation, said, \"we have always understood the frustrations of the workers but have been surprised at the length of this action.\" \nThe evicted workers say that, after spending time with their families, they plan to return to the protests against Vestas, joining the impromptu camp of hundreds of protesters which has sprung up outside the factory gates. The Vestas occupiers have received support from a broad coalition of left-wing political parties, trade unions, environmental groups, the Tory-dominated Isle of Wight Council, and a handful of MPs; today, the last major left party which had not joined the coalition, Arthur Scargill's Socialist Labour Party, released a statement saying The SLP's spokesman, Alan Johnson, went on to tell \"Wikinews\" that the occupiers \"have our full support.\" None of the three large parties dominating the British parliament have backed the Vestas workers, however, although the ruling Labour Party has recently sponsored talks between among the coalition of trade unions supporting the occupiers.\nPolice served the remaining occupiers notice to vacate the premises yesterday at noon; Vestas's first attempt at obtaining a warrant was stymied in court when the defence successfully argued that notice requiring possession had not been correctly served to the occupiers.\nThe occupiers lived in the factory twenty-four hours a day during the occupation, sleeping in a 1600-square-foot (149-square-metre) office, maintaining hygiene as well as possible in the factory's bathrooms, and eating one small meal a day \u2014 initially from the contents of vending machines, then from what the company management supplied supplemented by whatever protesters were able to get over the fence surrounding the factory. The RMT, which has arranged legal representation for the Vestas occupiers, has accused Vestas of violating human rights and at one point said it would arrange to have a helicopter airlift food into the workers.\nThe end of the Newport occupation does not represent the end of unrest at Vestas's facilities in the Isle of Wight, however. A number of workers at Vestas's smaller plant in Cowes occupied the plant there on the evening of August 4, with activists from the RMT and environmental groups taking to the roof and waving flags proclaiming the occupation."}

The United States Geological Survey (USGS) says it's likely the quake was an aftershock to the deadly magnitude 9.1 earthquake in 2004 that triggered a massive tsunami killing nearly 230,000 people.\nThe warnings had applied to Myanmar, Indonesia, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Thailand. The NOAA indicated the risk of a tsunami was 'moderate to high', but no waves were reported in any of the areas indicated in the warning.\n\"Sea level readings indicate that a significant tsunami was not generated. Therefore the tsunami watch issued by this center has been canceled,\" said the NOAA earlier in a statement on its website.\nMinutes after the quake, at 2:07 a.m. Indian time, the USGS said a magnitude 6.4 earthquake struck 31 kilometers (19 miles) south-southwest of Shizuoka Prefecture, Japan, with a depth of 26.8 km (16.7 miles). However, officials in Japan put the quake at a magnitude 6.6. A tsunami watch was also issued for the area and a short time later small, a two foot rise in sea level was reported in the Tsuruga Bay area. A 10 inch rise in sea level was also reported in Yaizu City. \nAs a precaution, Japanese officials have shut down at least two units, reactor No. 4 and 5 at the nuclear power facility in Hamaoka to perform a safety check. Alarms inside the plant indicated a possible radiation leak inside reactor 5, but officials say no radiation has been detected outside containment. According to Japan's Trade Ministry, both reactors shut down automatically after sensors detected the quake. Area trains have also been stopped. This was the second earthquake in Japan in two days, following an earlier one that measured 6.9 near Tokyo.\nThere are no reports of major damage with either quake. In Japan, some windows broke and roof tiles dislodged from roofs. Spokesman for the USGS, Paul Caruso, says both quakes appear to be unrelated. Minor injuries were reported in Japan due to falling objects, but there are no reports of any deaths. Singer, songwriter and actress Jessica Simpson, who flew to Japan over the weekend, is also safe after feeling the shaking.\n\"Thought I was hallucinating during a 6.6 earthquake in Japan. I have never felt anything like this in my life,\" said Simpson from via her Twitter account.\nIndonesia has also seen an earthquake, a 5.7 magnitude that occurred 74km from Wewak at 1:46 a.m. local time on Monday."}

Discussions with Gibson Guitars led to the development of the Gibson Les Paul guitar, which with its unprecedented tonal properties (caused in part by its unprecedented weight) quickly established itself among players of both the emerging rock &amp; roll style of music and the developing electric blues.\nPaul was also a pioneer of recording techniques. Paul's experiments with multi-tracking in the 1940s led to a string of chart successes with songs like \"How High The Moon\", in which Paul's guitar work and then-wife Mary Ford's vocals appeared a novel many-layered setting, Paul playing up to eight guitar parts and Ford harmonizing with herself.\nAlthough Paul entered semi-retirement in his 50s, he remained active and performing almost until his death; his last album was released in 2006. Les Paul received a number of accolades throughout his career: he was the recipient of numerous Grammy awards, an inductee into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, and the namesake of the Mix Foundation's Les Paul Award for \"individuals or institutions that have set the highest standards of excellence in the creative application of audio technology.\" He was also the subject of two biographical films.\nWhile Les Paul had no children, he is survived by a godson, the guitarist Steve Miller."}

Meanwhile, in an earlier interview with \"Wikinews\" on the twentieth anniversary of the bombing last year, the then-head of the US group \"Victims of Pan Am Flight 103\", Kara Weipz, told \"Wikinews\" that \"There is no difference between the truth as we see it and the official version of events.

In it Duggan maintains that Megrahi should die behind bars in Scotland, casts doubt on the likelihood of a transfer to Libya and attacks the Scottish media's coverage of the case. Dr. Swire has also been contacted with a request to comment.\n\"The murderer appealed again, and now seeks, without apparent reason, to withdraw that appeal. The court had little discretion, and absent some grandstanding from the bomber\u2019s attorneys, it is certainly not what the Scottish media is making it out to be. It is NOT the key to Mr. Megrahi's release pursuant to the Prisoner Transfer Agreement, since Article 5 of that agreement states that there cannot be any pending legal action against him. There is, as everyone should know, another appeal pending, which was originally filed before Megrahahi's, objecting to the lenience of the sentence for the murder of 270 innocent souls. In addition, Justice Minister must still rule on the request for transfer, a request made by [Libyan President] Muammar Gadhafi, who has admitted his nation\u2019s guilt in the most egregious case of state-sponsored terrorism in UK history. It is simply inconceivable to us that the would respect the wishes of this man. \n\"The American victim\u2019s families cannot understand why Megrahi would withdraw his appeal, unless his attorneys thought that they were not persuading Minister MacAskill that the bomber was indeed on his deathbed. That is a more likely scenario since they had been saying he had one foot in the grave for the past year. If the rumors of his impending release, fueled by the Herald, Guardian, Scotsman and other \u201cnewspapers\u201d were meant to test public opinion about his release, either by Prisoner Transfer or Compassionate Release, then the trial balloon was successful. There has been worldwide outrage and opprobrium that this man might get to go home to a hero\u2019s welcome in Libya. \n\"The only other reason we can imagine is that his attorneys were not aware of the other pending appeal, and are perhaps taking advice from that legal scholar, , who still maintains that there was insufficient evidence in the first trial and appeal. Black has been wrong about every step of this case from the beginning, yet he and Dr. James Swire are given full opportunity to express their views of the evidence in the UK \u201cnewspapers.\u201d\n\"The convicted bomber should not be transferred under any subsequent agreement since the arrangements for the promised that if convicted, the defendant would serve his prison term in Scotland. As to the application for release on compassionate grounds, this has caused the most uproar around the world. News media, not so many in Scotland I regret to say, wonder just how much compassion was shown by Megrahi and Libya when they planted a bomb designed to murder hundreds of innocent, unsuspecting lives.\"\nMegrahi is now set to complete his sentence in , where he is to serve a minimum of 27 years, barring any further developments."}

Peltier is serving two consecutive life sentences in the United States Penitentiary in Lewisburg, Pennsylvania. Peltier had been previously denied parole in 1993.\nPeltier, along with Robert Robideau and Darelle \"Dino\" Butler, was charged with the murders of FBI Special Agents Jack Coler and Ronald Williams after a shootout during unrest on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation. Robideau and Butler were acquitted, the jury finding the shootings of Coler and Williams having been in self defense, but Peltier had fled the country and was tried separately on his return and found guilty.\nPeltier's attorney, Eric Seitz, stated that the announcement of Peltier's being denied parole was made without the courtesy of informing the defense, and noted that Peltier, currently 64 years of age, is in poor health with numerous complaints. U.S. Attorney Drew Wrigley, meanwhile, called Peltier \"an unrepentant, cold-blooded murderer who executed FBI special agents\" who is \"exactly where he belongs \u2014 federal prison\".\nPeltier has consistently denied that he murdered Coler and Williams and maintains that the FBI framed him. Supporters of his release include a wide range of world figures, including Nelson Mandela and the Dalai Lama and Amnesty International, while not classifying Peltier as a political prisoner, asserts that \"there is concern about the fairness of the proceedings leading to his conviction and it is believed that political factors may have influenced the way the case was prosecuted.\"\nA statement from the FBI released after the announcement that Peltier would stay in jail reads, in part, \"His callous criminal acts demonstrated a complete disrespect for human life and for the law. His time served in jail for their 1975 murders has not diminished the brutality of his crimes or the pain and sorrow felt by the families of his victims or the FBI family.\"\nLeonard Peltier is next eligible for parole in 2024."}

As of 11 p.m. AST August 21 (0300 UTC August 22), Hurricane Bill was located within 10 nautical miles of 31.0\u00b0N 67.5\u00b0W, or about 545 mi (880 km) east-southeast of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina. Maximum sustained winds were near 90 knots (105 mph, 165 km/h), with stronger gusts. Forecasters estimate the storm's minimum barometric pressure to be around 957 millibars.\nThe storm is currently moving towards the north-northwest at about 20 mph. This path should lead to an eventual turn towards the north and later northeast, bringing the storm between Bermuda and the east coast of the United States on Saturday. \nThough the brunt of the storm should remain offshore, residents in New England are monitoring Bill's progress. The National Weather Service expects seas to turn dangerous this weekend, with some waves potentially reaching 35 feet (11 meters) in height offshore. According to Steve Kass of the Rhode Island Emergency Management Agency, \"If you own a boat and you like to go out any distance, this is not the weekend to do it\".\nMassachusetts Governor Deval Patrick advised pleasure boaters and swimmers to avoid waters around Cape Cod: \"Boaters should not, I repeat not, stay on their boats to ride out this storm. Swimmers should stay out of the water throughout this weekend. There will be life-threatening rip currents along the entire coast\". Beaches were being closed in some areas, including on Nantucket and Martha's Vineyard.\nPatrick said emergency workers were moving supplies to certain shelters, just in case conditions worsen. On its predicted path, Bill will likely disrupt the Obama family's vacation to Martha's Vineyard. \nWhile the U.S. will most likely be spared from significant damage, the Canadian Maritimes might not be so lucky. Peter Bowyer, a program supervisor of the Canadian Hurricane Centre said \"it will definitely be a hurricane when it reaches our Maritime waters Sunday. At this point, it is still not possible to give all the specifics everyone wants.\" The eastern shore of Nova Scotia and southeastern portions of Newfoundland appear to be at greatest risk. \nOil companies have been vacating workers from offshore platforms within the Sable Offshore Energy Project in advance of Hurricane Bill.

He had begun to cut back on the dose after fearing Jackson was becoming addicted and for two days before the death gave him only lorazepam and midazolam.\nOn the day of his death, Murray said, he injected Jackson with lorazepam, then administered midazolam amongst other drugs.

Ground staff alerted the crew and an evacuation commenced.\nIn just three minutes and 27 seconds all the 157 passengers had evacuated, but the flight crew remained. The first officer was midway through evacuating and the captain still in the cockpit when the first explosion occurred, blasting the first officer to the ground. The captain escaped immediately afterwards and no-one was injured. \nIt was approximately five minutes before the first airport fire engine began to spray foam on the fuselage, by which time two more explosions had occurred. The structure collapsed shortly afterwards while other fire crews arrived from both the airport and the city.\nThe final report has confirmed that during mandatory scheduled maintenance conducted per Boeing's recommendations about a month and a half prior to the jet's destruction, a washer had come off a bolt in the wing. As a result, the bolt had fallen off. When the jet arrived at Naha, it used its slats to assist the landing.\nHowever, the bolt had worked its way into the track that one of these slats moved on, and as the slat was retracted after the landing the bolt became trapped between the slat and a fuel tank, which it punched through. Fuel then leaked out and dribbled onto the hot engine, starting the fire that then consumed the aircraft. The fire only started when the engine was shut down, as before then the fuel had been blown away by the force produced.\nThe report criticised the design of the bolt, as it \"was unable to prevent the assembly from falling off if the washer is not installed.\" It further commented that neither Boeing nor China Airlines had considered the fact that the bolt's location was difficult to access when planning the maintenance to the aircraft. The fact that maintenance workers had not reported the difficulty of the work was also found to have contributed to the washer's absence going undetected. As part of the job, the nut on the end of the bolt was replaced, but the engineer couldn't see the bolt's head and didn't check the washer.\nAs a result of the accident the aviation authorities of Boeing's and China Airlines' home countries \u2014 the United States and Taiwan respectively \u2014 have been sent recommendations to review procedures to ensure the accident cannot be repeated.\nSources.\n "}

The researchers monitored 3,350 patients aged between 50\u201375, who were thought to be at risk of heart disease, but did not show any significant symptoms at the start of the study. Over an eight-year time period, 181 of those people taking aspirin had heart attacks or strokes.\nMore than 3,000 men aged 50\u201375 were randomly assigned to receive a daily dose of aspirin or a placebo pill and were watched over the eight year time period. There were 34 major bleeds in people taking aspirin, or 2%, in comparison to 1.2% of those who took the placebo. The Aspirin for Asymptomatic Atherosclerosis (AAA) have found that the routine use of aspirin does not prevent vascular disease or conditions and the use of it \"could not be supported.\" \nPeter Weissberg, a professor at the British Heart Foundation, the company which was partly responsible in funding for the trials said, \"we know that patients with symptoms of artery disease, such as angina, heart attack or stroke, can reduce their risk of further problems by taking a small dose of aspirin each day. The findings of this study agree with our current advice that people who do not have symptomatic or diagnosed artery or heart disease should not take aspirin, because the risks of bleeding may outweigh the benefits. Because it's been around for a long time, people think, 'It must be safe and it can't do any harm'. They are taking it 'just in case' but it's much more dangerous than some other drugs that people get concerned about, like statins.\"\nProfessor Gerry Fowkes presented the research from the University of Edinburgh at the European Society of Cardiology congress in Barcelona, Spain, which was attended by more than 30,000 heart specialists.\n\"Our research suggests that aspirin should not be prescribed to the general population, although it does have benefits for people with established heart disease or other conditions,\" stated Fowkes."}

Stanley McChrystal, is making his case for a new strategy in the recent submission of classified recommendations to U.S. President Barack Obama. A focal point for discussion is Gen. McChrystal's recommendation for troop levels in the country of which he is expected to recommend an increase by the end of this year. The classified report was submitted this Monday morning, August 31, 2009 and will eventually find its way onto the desk of President Obama serving as the likely basis upon which he will make decisions about the future of the U.S. engagement in the country.\nAt this time the 20-page report is being reviewed by Gen. McChrystal's superiors to include Gen. David Petraeus, Commander of U.S. Central Command, Admiral Mike Mullen, U.S. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and Gen. Egon Ramms, the senior North Atlantic Treaty Organization Commander before going to U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates and on to the President. A public release of the report is not currently scheduled. \nAlthough the report does not include requests for troop increases, it is possible that such a request will occur in the coming weeks or shortly thereafter. Gen. McChrystal reportedly described the situation in Afghanistan as \"serious\" which has caused some concerns about the overall progress of the war, driving the need for the strategy assessment. The White House has signaled its concern with Afghanistan as the Press Secretary, Robert Gibbs, described the Afghan War as \"under-resourced politically, militarily and economically\". \nWhile there have been some leaks about other content in the report, none have been officially recognized by Gen. McChrystal or the U.S. government. Even still Gen. McChrystal remains resolved to ensure the maximum utilization of resources he already commands with reports that he ordered his subordinates to evaluate the need for high numbers of administrative positions vice utilizing those troops in combat roles. Additionally, the U.S. Army is considering whether or not they will utilize contractors to conduct guard duty at certain bases as well as convoy duty.\nGen. McChrystal stated, \"The situation in Afghanistan is serious, but success is achievable and demands a revised implementation strategy, commitment and resolve, and increased unity of effort\". This report will likely be the first step in what will be many of significant changes in U.S. strategy."}

If the charges are upheld, the punishments could include a fine, exclusion from races or complete disqualification from the current championship.\nRenault are due to appear before the council in Paris on September 21st, days before this year's race in Singapore. The team has refused to comment before the hearing.\nRenault have already been in trouble this season, being suspended for one race after releasing Alonso's car with an unsafe wheel, which came off on the track. The team succeeded in appealing this.\nSources.\n "}

The Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) said that the weather forecast in the coming days was improving, with no large amounts of rainfall predicted. \nOver 500 homes had to be evacuated in Moray after the River Spey and River Lossie started to overflow their banks. 400 homes were also evacuated in the Elgin area and 50 more in Fochabers. Other areas affected included Aberdeen, Dyce, Lossiemouth and Rothes, where 25 homes had to be evacuated. Over 600 homes were evacuated in Morayshire.\nThe Grampian Police and Tayside Police advised residents not to drive unless absolutely necessary. The Northern Constabulary advised residents to travel with caution.\nIn some places, a month's worth of rain had fallen in just 24 hours. About 67 millimetres of rain had fallen in Aberdeen - roughly the equivalent of an average month of rainfall. In Lossiemouth, the rainfall was 76.4 millimetres - 15mm more than the average amount every month. \nAs cleanup efforts progressed, Chief executive of Moray Council Alistair Keddie said, \"Everything possible was done to protect residents.\" However, some residents of the local areas are not so certain.\nMary Campbell, 62 from Fochabers said to the Times Online that she was \"calling [for help] from 8pm but no-one showed up until about midnight. All the time the river kept going up and up. They came with sandbags, but by then it was too late. The water was already in my house.\"\nThe MSP for Moray Angus Robertson MP stated, \"Water levels are higher than I have ever seen them before and communities have rallied to support people whose homes and businesses have been flooded. The objective must now be for everyone to help the victims of the worst flooding to hit Moray for many years to assist them rebuild their lives and get back to normality as quickly as possible. The hard lessons learnt from this latest devastation include the need for local agencies to redouble their efforts to get flood prevention measures into place and to recognise that climate change will only lead to more flooding in the future.\""}

In the email, the company's chief executive, Jeff Bezos apologised again, and described the earlier actions as \"stupid, thoughtless and painfully out of line with our principles.\"\nInitially, the two works of Orwell were made available to Kindle owners by a third-party company which did not have the rights to distribute them. When Amazon was alerted to this by the actual rights holder, the company removed the books from their online store then, far more controversially, remotely deleted the books from their customers' devices before issuing refunds.\nIn the aftermath of significant press coverage of Amazon's actions to remove content, legal action was started against them in Washington alleging violations of the company's published terms of service, the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, and Washington's consumer protection legislation. A Michigan student named as a plaintiff in the case explained that the deletion of his copy of \"1984\" had rendered his annotations and notes worthless.\nFirst published in 1949, the novel \"Nineteen Eighty-Four\" will not enter the public domain in the United States until 2044."}

The high-profile game was nationally televised on the ESPN network. The Broncos, whose \"mid-major\" Western Athletic Conference is less competitive than the Ducks' Pac-10 Conference, had previously defeated the Ducks in 2008. Prior to the game, Blount was quoted by \"Sports Illustrated\" as saying the Ducks \"owe [the Broncos] an ass-whuppin\u2019\" for the late hits delivered in the 2008 game. The volatile Blount, coming off a 1,000+ yard season in which he broke a school record for rushing touchdowns, had struggled in several 2008 games, including the encounter with the Broncos.\nThe Broncos, however, won 19\u20138 in their home field; and Blount and Oregon's offense failed to achieve a single first down for the game's first 37 minutes.\nA few seconds after the end of the game, Boise State defensive end Byron Hout taunted Blount and pushed him on the shoulder pad. Broncos Head Coach Chris Petersen attempted to restrain Hout. But Blount responded with a swift punch to the jaw, knocking Hout to the ground. Hout was not publicly disciplined for his actions. Blount then pushed teammate Garrett Embry, who was attempting to restrain him. Boise State replayed the punch on their large screen in the end-zone multiple times, before Blount had returned to the locker room.\nAs he was escorted to the locker room, Blount confronted jeering Boise State fans. Two police officers and Oregon assistant coach Scott Frost restrained Blount and escorted him into the locker room. Video of the incident spread rapidly on the Internet.\nBlount apologized after the incident, saying: \"I just apologize to everybody that was watching this \u2014 ESPN, national TV \u2014 I just apologize to all of our fans, all the Boise fans. It was just something that I shouldn't have done. I lost my head, and I shouldn't have taken it that far.\" Coach Chip Kelly suspended Blount for the remainder of the 2009 season. Blount was not dismissed from the team, however, and will be permitted to attend practice and retain his scholarship.\nThe incident was seen an important test for a leadership team in its first year. According to Oregon Athletic Director Mike Bellotti, the fact that the incident occurred after the game's conclusion made it the team's responsibility, rather than a Pac-10 issue. Kelly, Bellotti, and University of Oregon President Lariviere had each just entered the first year of his position. Pac-10 Commissioner Larry Scott, also in his first year, was in attendance at the game. He consulted with Oregon officials in advance of Blount's suspension, and afterward, the Pac-10 expressed complete support for the suspension, while declining to comment on the Broncos, who are not part of the Pac-10.\nAs a result of his negative rushing total (-5 yards) in the one game he played in the 2009 season prior to the suspension, combined with 1,002 yards in 2008, Blount holds the unusual distinction of having a 1,000-yard season with the Ducks, but less than 1,000 yards over his entire NCAA career."}

During the raid, one of the rescuers and the journalist's translator were killed in addition to about three others according to conflicting reports.\nFarrell, a journalist from \"The New York Times\" and dual British-Irish citizen, and his Afghan interpreter, Sultan Munadi, were taken captive by the Taliban while covering a September 4th bombing by coalition aircraft not far from Konduz City, Afghanistan. A local Afghan reported that while Farrell was interviewing individuals that witnessed the bombing, he received a warning from another Afghan that he should leave the area. Soon after, gun-shots were heard and the Taliban was said to be approaching. Reportedly, police warned journalists covering the strike that insurgents controlled the area surrounding the tanker and that they should take precautions for their personal safety. \nWhen Farrell was taken, few major news outlets reported his capture for security reasons. NY Times Executive Editor earlier said \"We feared that media attention would raise the temperature and increase the risk to the captives.\" \nAccording to Farrell, while he was treated well \u2014 given food, water, and other provisions \u2014 his captors taunted Munadi. During their captivity, Farrell commented that his captors would drive within 1500 feet of NATO and Afghan outposts with weapons displayed to prove their daring. Six to eight guards took turns monitoring the captives. \nFarrell is the second NY Times journalist to be taken captive in Afghanistan in less than a year. In November 2008, reporter and his colleague Tahir Ludin were taken captive south of Kabul and moved to Pakistan before they managed to escape in June of this year. Farrell was also kidnapped in April 2004 while on-assignment in , Iraq.\nKidnappings are done for ideological reasons by some Taliban members but are also conducted by local insurgents for ransom. At least 16 journalists have been kidnapped since the beginning of the Afghan war.\nAccording to Keller, the possibility had arisen that Farrell and Munadi would be moved, possibly to Pakistan, which may have caused the military to act much sooner. On the morning of September 9th, Mohammad Sami Yowar, a spokesman for the Konduz Governor's Office, briefed that British Commandos conducted a helicopter assault on the house in which the captives were held and subsequently a gun-battle erupted. A Taliban commander inside the house where Farrell and Munadi were being held was reportedly killed during the raid. Munadi was killed during the firefight and British officials said that they could not rule out the possibility he was killed by one of the Commandos. The Konduz Governor, Abdel Wahid Omar Khil, indicated that a woman and child probably caught in the crossfire were also killed during the raid. Farrell indicated that he was not harmed. \n has called for an investigation of the Munadi killing stating that \"The tragedy that took place this morning in northern Afghanistan raises many questions.\" U.S. military officials confirmed the raid was carried out by NATO and Afghan soldiers; no further details were provided."}

When asked for comment, Miller said, \"Mike talks a lot during the hearing...I was getting ready so I wasn't really hearing what he was saying.\" "}

The school was founded by celebrity couple Will Smith and Jada Pinkett-Smith, who paid about US$1 million to lease the facility in 2008. Former head of school Jacqueline Olivier was removed from her job in July, and replaced by Piano Foster, an individual who has taken Scientology courses at the organization's Celebrity Centre.\nSmith and Pinkett-Smith are good friends with Scientologists Katie Holmes and her husband Tom Cruise. In 2006, Smith acknowledged to \"World Entertainment News Network\" that he had discussed Scientology with Cruise: \"I've talked to Tom about it. [There\u2019s] lots of incredible, wonderful concepts but Jada and I don't necessarily believe in organized religion.\" \"ABC News\" reported that 2008 tax returns for the Smiths show they gave $122,500 to organizations with ties to the Church of Scientology.\nIn an interview with \"Ebony\", Pinkett-Smith denied the school was affiliated with Scientology: \"All I can say is it is not a Scientology school. Now, If you don't trust me, and you are questioning my integrity, that's a whole different matter. That is straight evil to think I would bring families into that educational institution and then try to get them to convert into some religion,\" she said. According to \"New York Daily News\", the school is registered with the government of California as \"non-religious\". \nThe school utilizes a teaching methodology called Study Technology, which was developed by Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard. Study Technology is promoted through Applied Scholastics, a Scientology-associated organization founded in 1972. \"Study Technology is a secular methodology intended to help students better understand what is being studied and apply it to real life,\" said Pinkett-Smith in an email to ABCnews.com. Karin Pouw, an official with the Church of Scientology, was contacted by \"ABC News\" but did not comment on a possible affiliation between NVLA and Scientology, instead referring questions back to the school itself. \n\"New York Daily News\" cited \"Radar Online\" in reporting that former head of school Olivier was fired from her position because she had issues with the Study Tech teaching methodology used in the school. According to \"The Sydney Morning Herald\", Olivier was removed from her $200,000 position with the school because she reportedly did not agree with portions of the school's curriculum which were developed by L. Ron Hubbard.\nCarnegie Mellon University computer science Professor David S. Touretzky, described by \"ABC News\" as \"the most ardent critic of Study Technology\", spoke with ABCNews.com about his thoughts on Scientology connections with the school: \"What they seem to have is some sort of a hybrid. Scientology repackaged for the Hollywood crowd. It's hitting all the politically correct elements ... but snuck in there is this Scientology stuff.\" Professor Touretzky operates a web site which analyzes Study Tech and argues that it is actually a form of Scientology masked as an educational method. In a February 2008 interview with \"Wikinews\", Professor Touretzky mused that recent criticism of Scientology on the Internet might prove to \"warn off Hollywood celebs from cozying up to the cult\", including Will Smith.\nExecutive director of the California Association of Independent Schools, Jim McManus, was also critical of L. Ron Hubbard's methodology, stating: \"I look at the Study Tech ideas and it doesn't seem sound educationally.\" University of Virginia psychology professor Dan Willingham, author of \"Why Don't Students Like School\", asserted to \"ABC News\" that the methodology is flawed: \"It's perfectly possible that the methodology is based on ridiculous principles and that something effective is happening in the classroom, but ridiculous principles certainly lowers that possibility.\"\nMembers of the Internet-based group critical of Scientology, Project Chanology, were present at the school's 2009 opening to protest what they called a \"front\" of the Church of Scientology. A 2008 press release by Project Chanology was critical of what it referred to as the revenue the Church of Scientology receives from licensing fees schools pay the organization for utilizing the Study Tech teaching methodology. \"This revenue stream is one of the many sources of income which the Church of Scientology uses for such tactics as invoking frivolous lawsuits and hiring private investigators to intimidate critics,\" said the press release.\nAccording to the web site TruthAboutScientology.com, which publishes data compiled from Scientology magazines \"Freewinds\", \"Celebrity\" and \"Auditor\", multiple individuals in management roles at NVLA have attended Scientology classes. In addition to the newly installed head of school, Piano Foster, the school's director of learning Tasia Jones and its artistic director Sisu Raiken have both received Scientology course training. \"I officially took over on July 1, 2009, and I'm looking forward to the challenge. I've been working in education for the past 20 years at various public and charter schools so I feel I'm ready for the job,\" said Foster of her new position at NVLA. "}

Jermaine said that he could not understand why the Austrian media were ridiculing the acts, stating: \"When artists who have won eight Grammy Awards and sold millions of records around the world and are able to sell out large stadiums are then called 'B-list artists', are made fun of and generally disrespected, is something I just cannot understand.

It has described the majority of these deaths as preventable and suggested solutions to the problems.\n97% of the 2.6 million fatalities annually occur in low- and middle-income countries. The age group comprises 1.8 billion people, 30% of the total population. 15% of female deaths were down to \"maternal mortality\" which included pregnancy complications, unsafe abortions, and mutilation of genitals. Road traffic accidents accounted for 10% of deaths.\n6.3% of the deaths were suicides and 6% were down to violence. Tuberculosis and similar lung infections took 10% of the lives and HIV/AIDS killed 5.5%. Most of the deaths were in sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia. Africa and Southeast Asia were also the only places where male deaths were not above those of females, as much of the maternal mortality occurred there. The data came from 2004.\nIn developed countries, 32% of the deaths were down to road accidents. \"There has long been an assumption that young people are healthy, fit and they don't die,\" explained the report's lead author, Australian children's health expert George Patton. He goes on to say \"I've certainly heard politicians and policy-makers make statements of that kind... Some of these problems, related to emotion, are actually very prominent causes not only of death in adolescence, but health problems later in life.\"\nThe study said safer speed limits, more use of helmets and seatbelts, and better enforcement of drunk driving law could greatly curb the road deaths. Maternal deaths and sexually transmitted disease rates could be cut by sexual education, safe abortion clinics, pregnancy support, HIV testing and treatment, and access to contraceptives.\nViolence and suicide could be reduced by education in life skills and an improved role of parents, the study found. It also sought reduction of availability of poisons, firearms, and other dangerous items. In the case of suicide, the study said more work was needed to help young people recover from acts of violence, sexual assault, and child abuse in both the short and long term. Alcohol access reduction was also requested.\nThe study was conducted by University College London's Russell Viner, World Health Organization's Krishna Bose and George Patton of the Royal Children's Hospital in Melbourne, Australia."}

His work is often credited as saving over a billion lives.\nBorn in 1914 in Cresco, Iowa Borlaug worked on the family farm before enrolling at the University of Minnesota, gaining a master's and a Ph.D. in plant pathology and genetics.\nIn 1944 he began working for the Cooperative Wheat Research and Production Program, a joint project of the Mexican government and the Rockefeller Foundation. It was there that he led the development of new disease-resistant, high yield wheat varieties.\nHis introduction of these varieties to Southeast Asia in the 1960s averted mass famines, and led to countries such as India and Pakistan becoming self-sufficient in food. This was soon heralded as the start of a \"Green Revolution\", and later his efforts were extended to Africa.\nFrom 1984 until his death Borlaug taught as Distinguished Professor of International Agriculture at Texas A&amp;M University, whilst continuing his research in Mexico and his promotion of agricultural development around the world. In 1986 he established the World Food Prize to recognize contributors to improvements in world food supplies.

He was an individual, he was a maverick, he was mercurial, he was magical, he was special, he was rare.\"\nKeith Floyd died on September 14, the same day a documentary was broadcast on Channel 4 called \"Keith Meets Keith\", which featured comedian Keith Allen interviewing Keith Floyd. It emerged that his death was just a few hours beforehand, however the information was unknown at the time of broadcast.\nCelia Martin, who was staying with Floyd at the time of his death, gave an interview with London local newspaper \"Evening Standard\".\n\"When we got home he had a siesta and got up feeling a bit headachy. We had both eaten a lot so I put it down to that. He laid down on the sofa and I thought he went to sleep. Then suddenly his breathing became erratic,\" Martin said. \"I phoned for an ambulance and the operator gave me instructions on how to help him. He didn't say anything at all. The ambulance people were here for about an hour. They thought there was a chance they could save him. It was so bizarre, we were sitting down to watch the documentary at 10pm but by that time he had died.\""}

The trade policy came about as a result of a trade-complaint initiated by the United Steelworkers Union (USW) filed before the U.S. International Trade Commission. As reported by Steve Levine of \"BusinessWeek\", \"In [the USW's] trade complaint to the U.S. International Trade Commission, the USW invoked a provision in China's 2001 accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO) that allows protection from surging imports from the country [China]. The union documented a tripling of Chinese tire imports from 2004 to 2008 [...]\" The Trade Commission initially recommended a 55% tariff however, President Obama agreed to only 35%. The trade tariff will be diminished by 5% per year for the next three years to 25%. The deadline for President Obama's decision was September 17. The trade tariff will take effect on September 26, pegging rates at the new level from the current 4%. The dispute will now move to the WTO where it can take up to 18 months for adjudication. \nTo quantify the impact of the tariff, in 2008 China supplied US$1.8 billion in tires to the U.S. or about one-third of the U.S. market, with two-thirds of U.S. companies producing their tires in China. It's likely that the effects of the suit will exceed $1 billion in trade costs, as reported by several other news agencies. \nOn the 14th of September, the Chinese government via its Ministry of Commerce website, announced that they would institute an investigation into the dumping of U.S. auto parts and chicken products; they are also filing a complaint at the WTO regarding this matter. A formal announcement of trade tariffs against U.S. goods has not occurred.\nThe two countries' executive and economic teams will meet in Pittsburgh for the G-20 meeting on September 24 and 25 to discuss these and other economic issues."}

Police and the Crown Prosecution Service have been criticised for bringing the case to trial.\nMatthew Swift, 18, and Ross McKnight, 16, were cleared of accusations they planned a copycat attack at their school in Manchester to coincide with the April 20 anniversary of the original mass shooting. They had been charged with conspiracy to murder and conspiracy to cause explosions likely to endanger life or cause serious injury to property. Swift and McKnight have spent the last six months behind bars on remand, Swift in prison and McKnight a young offenders institute.\nPolice had thought they had found a criminal plot when they were alerted after a girl received a drunken phone call from one boy talking about a school shooting. They discovered a second girl had received a text saying \"If I ever text you not to come into school don't question it, just don't go in.\" The pair were found to be in possession of \"The Anarchist Cookbook\" and a BB gun . No guns or explosives were found even though the prosecution alleged to have video footage of the pair manufacturing explosives.\nThe prosecution case further focused on diary entries and plans talking of how they would perpetrate the \"greatest massacre ever.\" \"Audenshaw high,\" wrote Swift \"will be no more. Unlike Columbine, my propane bomb will actually fucking explode and I will walk from classroom to classroom killing the fuck out of everybody, then maybe people will learn.\"\nThe 2007 plans were alleged by prosecutors to have included a diversion bomb away from the school, which was the main target, even though they also suggested attacks on several other buildings. Swift explained that his writings were \"naive and pathetic ways to channel my teenage angst. I was 16 with a vivid imagination.\" The defense had focused on the notion that the plot was pure fantasy.\nSupporting this was testimony, including that of McKnight's police officer father Ray, that the duo had plenty of other weird and wonderful schemes. Much as the shooting idea had come from Michael Moore's documentary \"Bowling for Columbine\", so too had they discussed living off the land in Alaska after watching \"Into the Wild\". Other ideas included a winter mission to climb Ben Nevis and launching a dinghy service on local canal routes.\nThe five men and seven women that comprised the jury agreed, and took just 45 minutes to reject the charges. They even waited for defence counsel so they could wave and smile at them. It was, according to McKnight's lawyer Roderick Carus QC, perhaps the \"quickest acquittal of this apparent gravity\" he had ever witnessed. He said the case was a weak one that should never have gone to court. One of the lawyers on the case described the teens as victims of an \"unnecessary, heavy-handed prosecution\" that was a waste of several hundred thousand pounds.\nBritish officers working the case flew to the United States to speak with those that worked upon the Columbine massacre. Later, the former head of the Columbine investigation traveled to the UK.\nRay McKnight did not comment on the decision to try the case, but he did say both defendants had experienced \"purgatory\" and \"absolute agony\" while imprisoned. \"We are all just incredibly relieved,\" he said, stating that he never doubted his son's innocence for a moment. His son read the following statement outside Manchester Crown Court: \"I would like to make it clear that at no time was any person put at risk. This was just a fantasy. This was never a reality. I would just like to say that during my time in custody, I have taken my GCSEs. I hope that my wish to join the army has not been harmed.\""}

He was prosecuted by Waseem Raja. Waseem told the court: \"The defendant was using a TomTom satellite navigation system. The defendant followed that system to the letter, so much so it led him up a lane clearly unsuitable for motor vehicles.\"\n\"The path was such it was not designed for use of motor vehicles yet Mr Jones slavishly continued to follow the satnav system to the point where his eyes and his brain must have been telling him otherwise to such a degree he was not exercising proper control of the vehicle.\"\nOn March 22, 2009, Robert Jones was driving a BMW 5 Series and was trying to get to his home in Doncaster, South Yorkshire after staying with friends in Todmorden, West Yorkshire. He was unsure of the route home and so followed his satellite navigation system, which was in the car. He continued to follow instructions despite being told that the narrowing dirt track he was driving on was actually a road. At the time the petrol gauge in the car indicated that he had just seven miles of fuel left. Because of this, Jones was desperate to find a filling station. He became so distracted by the sat-nav that he didn't realise his mistakes until he struck a fence on the edge of a 100 foot (30.5 metre) drop.

Its description and location have been found to match an old account Fonti gave authorities three years ago, and environmental detection equipment has been dispatched to the ship, images of which do show barrels in the area.\nFonti claims he blew it up with explosives from Holland and it was used to dispose of Norwegian nuclear waste. The damage seen by the team working at the site does appear consistent with this version of events. Prosecutors say it appears the issue is displaying \"all the appearances of being a confirmation\". Fonti says waste was disposed of for businesses across Europe.\nNicola Pace, an Italian prosecutor, said there was evidence of \"deliberate sinking of 42 ships with cargoes of waste, including radioactive waste\" but there has never been concrete proof.

Over thirty vessels are believed to be in Italian waters.\nBoth Fonti and environmental group Legambiente have also claimed vessels were sent to Somalia and other developing countries with toxic cargoes, which were either sunk with the ship or buried on land. Legambiente alleges that local rebel groups were given weapons in exchange for receiving the waste ships.

His parents have had his name changed to a girl's by deed poll, and the boy is now preparing for hormone treatment and eventual surgery.\nFormer classmates from primary school noticed the change, and the boy was the subject of taunting, including being asked by other children if he was \"gay\".\nThe school called an emergency assembly and ordered fellow pupils to treat the individual as female, and threatened tough disciplinary action if he wasn't treated as a girl or if his new name was not used.\nMany parents were outraged by the assembly. One of them stated, \"They behaved appallingly by throwing this hand grenade into the room and then leaving the inevitable questions about it for unprepared parents. Maybe we could have explained sexual politics and encouraged our kids to be more sensitive if we'd had a chance to be involved.\" \nDeidre Sanders, an agony aunt for British tabloid \"The Sun\", which broke the story, gave her view: \"It's ironic pupils will be disciplined if they fail to handle this child's sex change 'sensitively' \u2014 when their school could hardly have handled it less sensitively. Breaking news like this in a mass assembly without pre-briefing parents was crass and cruel \u2014 and added to this child's troubles.\"\nBecause of the tauntings, the boy was absent from school on Thursday. The family have been receiving threats and the house is now under police protection. \nThe Sun does know the identity of the boy but has refused to reveal it. The boy had told his classmates that for years he had wanted to be a girl. It is understood that the boy was treated as a male by his primary school principal, despite \"girlie\" behaviour such as wearing a bikini instead of shorts at swimming lessons, drying himself on Barbie towels, wearing pink ribbons in his hair and riding a pink scooter to school. \nIn an interview with Sky News Online, a spokesperson for the Gender Identity Research and Education Society (GIRES) said, \"It is very unfortunate [...] It needs a careful process of familiarisation, not the big bang approach. The proper way would have been to train all staff before the term started, to work with the child's peer group and to prepare the teachers to be able to talk to the other pupils and their parents individually to answer their questions. What one school did was get the pupil to talk with peers in an interaction that was supervised by teachers. That kind of careful process is what's required.\"\nEarlier this year, a German born by the name of Tim became Kim Petras after having medication at the age of 12 to suspend her puberty. She later had feminising hormone treatment and eventually gender confirmation surgery at the age of 16, making her the youngest transsexual in the world.\nAccording to the Sun, this 12 year old boy is preparing to progress with hormone therapy and possibly undergo surgery that would make him one of the world's youngest sex-change patients."}

Scotland's First Minister Alex Salmond MSP unveiled a bronze statue and a memorial garden in Moodiesburn on Sunday in front of a crowd of approximately 600. \nAt roughly 0700 BST on September 18, 1959, 47 men who were working in \"Auchengeich Collery\" in North Lanarkshire, Scotland were overcome by smoke as they were walking down to start work. They were subsequently killed after being trapped by a fire in the mine which prevented them from escaping. At the time, a decision had been made to flood the pit after attempts to rescue the men failed. Only one miner had managed to survive the blaze. It transpired that the fire was caused by an electrical fault 1,000\u00a0ft below the surface. \nFirst Minister Salmond unveiled a memorial garden and a bronze statue which had been placed to mark the 50th anniversary of the incident. The statue is one of a miner. A religious service was carried out from Bishop Joseph Devine. Tom Clarke, MP for Chryston and Bellshill, also attended the event. Memorial committee chairman Daniel Taylor read out the names of the late 47 people while another person was playing bagpipes in the background.\nWhen the service came to a close, First Minister Salmond commented on the tragedy, saying \"The tragedy at Auchengeich Colliery left barely a town, village or mining family in North Lanarkshire unaffected. Fifty years on, the memories of the fateful day which claimed the lives of so many husbands, fathers, brothers and sons endure and I am honoured to pay tribute to them. Scotland is fortunate enough to have been blessed with rich natural resources, from the abundant coal seams of the central belt to the oil and gas reserves off our shores and the emerging renewable energy sources we are just beginning to feel the benefits of. But we should never forget the human cost which has come with that. Just as the Piper Alpha tragedy more than two decades ago underlined the hazards of North Sea exploration, the Auchengeich disaster showed all too starkly the dangers and risks which miners all over Scotland took for granted as part of their job every time they descended the pits. The excellent work of the people of North Lanarkshire and Auchengeich Miners' Welfare has provided this new memorial garden and magnificent bronze sculpture. Together, they are a truly fitting tribute to those 47 brave men who died in Auchengeich half a century ago.\""}

He was a lion of a man \u2013 no, make that Three Lions,\" he said, referring to the nickname for the England national football club.\nRobson's best man, Tom Wilson, said: \"He had innate charm and a ready smile, but was modest all his life, even somewhat shy \u2013 though he had largely overcome that in later life. He was always passionate about football, had a deep love of his family and great loyalty to his old friends, with a touching and justifiable pride in his beautiful home up here in his beloved North-East. Friends have said to me you should never finish a eulogy with a cliche, such as 'we will never see his like again'. But we won't.\"\nBobby Robson played for five football clubs, one of them the England international football team. He also managed nine football teams across Europe. He had been survived by his wife Lady Elsie since their marriage in June 1955, and also survived by his three children Paul, Andrew and Mark. His family had held a private funeral service for him in August."}

They are reviewing it. They will use it to help them make decisions about the future. The secretary [of Defense] is absorbing the assessment along with the president. If there are decisions that flow from that, they will make them at the appropriate time,\" the spokesman said.\nWhitman would not say when McChrystal will make his expected detailed request for more troops, or when a decision might be made.\nOn the president's aircraft Monday, White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs told reporters that while the general may want more troops, he does not expect a formal request for a little while. \"We are going to conduct that strategic assessment and do that in a way that lays out the best path forward before we make resource decisions, rather than having this go the other way around where one makes resources decisions and then finds a strategy,\" Gibbs said.\nGibbs said any decision on troop levels will wait until the conclusion of a broader assessment of the way forward in Afghanistan, of which he indicated McChrystal's document is only one part. \nLast week, US Defense Secretary Robert Gates appealed for patience, saying these are extremely important decisions, and the president should be given the time to get them right. The secretary indicated he, the president and other senior officials have sent questions to McChrystal about his assessment, and are awaiting his answers.\nIn the document, the general was critical of NATO forces, saying that they are \"poorly configured\" to fight an insurgency. He says if NATO countries continue to be \"pre-occupied\" with protecting their forces rather than protecting the people and accomplishing the mission, they \"run the risk of strategic defeat.\" He said the coalition must operate \"dramatically differently \u2014 even uncomfortably differently.\"\nHe also repeated some of his earlier calls for more civilian help and a new approach by his troops that makes the security of the Afghan people their top priority. He said the coalition is in a \"war of ideas,\" in which he says it must demonstrate its commitment and its ability to deliver security without causing undue civilian casualties.\nIn an interview with Voice of America, Afghanistan Ambassador to the United Nations Zahir Tanin endorsed General McChrystal's sense of urgency, and his view that while a comprehensive approach is needed, security comes first. \"From a military point of view, I think without enough resources, without the ability to stop the Taliban's advances, it would be very difficult to make any progress in other areas, including political progress in Afghanistan,\" Tanin said.\nAmbassador Tanin said McChrystal is in the best position to assess the security needs and if there is a need for more forces, the Afghan government must support such a request. \nHe also rejected concerns expressed by some, including Secretary Gates, that sending more foreign troops could alienate the Afghan people. The ambassador says the key for Afghans is not how many foreign troops there are or what strategy they implement, but whether they deliver security and defeat the insurgents.\nIn the report, McChrystal concluded that \"while the situation is serious, success is still achievable.\" But he said the effort needs \"a fundamentally new approach\" that is \"properly resourced and supported\" throughout the coalition and across military and civilian agencies."}

Hiram Monserrate felony assault case", "text": "At the opening of the criminal trial against New York State Senator Hiram Monserrate on Monday on charges of felony assault, prosecutors explained the motive behind his alleged attack on his girlfriend Karla Giraldo.\nDuring opening arguments in the case, prosecutor Scott Kessler stated that when Monserrate discovered that his girlfriend had the business card of another man, he chose to strike out at her. According to prosecutor Kessler, Monserrate \"struck her in a jealous rage\". Monserrate has entered a plea of not guilty to charges he sliced his girlfriend's face with broken glass during a conflict at their apartment in December 2008.\nAccording to the account given in court by prosecutors, Giraldo asked her boyfriend Monserrate for a glass of water. Prosecutors said that in response, Monserrate stated \"You want the water? You want the water? Here\u2019s your water!\" \u2013 and proceeded to cut her face using the glass. At the hospital, Giraldo reportedly told healthcare workers: \"I can\u2019t believe he did this to me. My face! My face!\".\nThe defense team denied that the injury to the woman by Monserrate was intentional, instead claiming that the incident was \"an accident\". Monserrate's lawyer, Joseph Tacopina, said \"What happened was an accident. There were only two people behind those closed doors and they both say it was an accident. You wonder why they even brought this case. It's nothing more than rank speculation.\" In Tacopina's account of the incident, Monserrate was bringing his girlfriend a glass of water and tripped \u2013 and Giraldo woke up and the glass collided into her face. Tacopina characterized her injuries as \"a freak accident\".\nKessler asserted that the incident was not an accident on the part of Monserrate. Referring to Monserrate's emotions at the time of the incident, Kessler said \"This case is about power and control. He didn't just want that card thrown out, he wanted it destroyed.\" According to prosecutors in the case, Giraldo originally stated to law enforcement officials that she had been attacked, and said to a nurse at the hospital where she was treated that her boyfriend had cut her face. The injuries to Giraldo's face necessitated 20 stitches in the area surrounding her left eye. After Giraldo found out that Monserrate would be arrested in the matter, she recanted her statements.\nSupreme Court Justice William Erlbaum will judge the case without a jury, as Monserrate waived his right for a trial before his peers. If convicted, Democrat Sen. Monserrate could serve prison time and lose his New York State Senate seat. \nThe group National Organization for Women has requested that the judge rule Monserrate should be given \"the maximum sentence allowable by law\". In an email to supporters, the organization said: \"Call or write the Honorable William M. Erlbaum. Send a message that violence against women must be stopped and perpetrators must be brought to justice.\" Included was a form letter with the message: \"I implore you to do the right thing by punishing Senator Monserrate, giving him the maximum sentence allowable by law. By doing so, you will be sending a very important message and that is that violence against women is a serious crime.\" \nIn response to complaints from Monserrate's attorney that the group's actions were inappropriate, the president of the organization in New York Marcia Pappas said \"We\u2019re imploring him to do the right thing. I\u2019m sure the judge knows what he needs to do, so his position is not compromised.\"\nMonserrate is a former city councilman. He became a member of the New York State Senate weeks after the conflict with Giraldo, and was made chair of the committee overseeing consumer affairs. Along with Democrat Pedro Espada Jr., Monserrate started a shift in control of the Senate by aligning with the Republican Party."}

However analysis of the new images show ridges up to 4 kilometres tall, similar in height to the Rocky Mountains or the Alps.\nThe images were taken around the planet's equinox on August 11, when the Sun was directly over Saturn's equator and caught the rings edge on. A similar equinox occurs today (September 22) on Earth. But whilst equinoxes occur twice a year on Earth, Saturn takes around 29.7 Earth years to orbit the Sun so the events are much rarer.\nWith the light from the Sun reaching Saturn's rings at such a low angle, scientists were able to measure the shadows cast by bumps on the rings and discover their surprising height. As Cassini project scientist Bob Pappalardo put it: \"It's like putting on 3-D glasses and seeing the third dimension for the first time. This is among the most important events Cassini has shown us.\"\nSome of the ring features are known to be caused by Saturn's moons, but others are harder to explain. \"To understand what we are seeing will take more time, but the images and data will help develop a more complete understanding of how old the rings might be and how they are evolving,\" said Linda Spilker, Cassini deputy project scientist.\nCassini was launched in 1997, and entered orbit around Saturn in 2004. It is part of the Cassini-Huygens joint mission between NASA, the European Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. "}

Travolta belongs to the controversial Church of Scientology, an organization which opposes psychiatry and does not recognize autism as an affliction. Prior to the testimony, Travolta had only publicly acknowledged that his son suffered from Kawasaki syndrome.\nTravolta's son Jett died in January 2009 at the age of 16 after experiencing a seizure. The ongoing extortion trial focuses on charges that attorney and Bahamian senator Pleasant Bridgewater and her client paramedic Tarrino Lightbourne requested US$25 million from Travolta in exchange for not revealing a document which stated Travolta did not wish for his son to be taken to a hospital. Travolta's son was transported to Rand Memorial hospital.\n\"My son was autistic and suffered from seizure disorder. Every five to ten days he suffered seizures which lasted 45 seconds to a minute,\" said Travolta in his court testimony. He said that after experiencing a seizure, his son would typically sleep for a period of 12 hours. The judge in the case instructed Travolta that he could be called back to testify later in the trial.\nCritics have asserted that Travolta and his wife Kelly Preston, also a Scientologist, had not previously discussed their son's autism in public due to their ties to Scientology. \"The Times\" reported that Travolta's court admission of his son's autism places him in contradiction with the views of Scientology. According to \"The Daily Telegraph\", Travolta arrived at the courthouse in The Bahamas escorted by several Scientologists.\nFormer Scientology minister, Bruce Hines, spoke to CBS News about the organization's beliefs regarding illness. \"They believe that the only reason a person can get ill is because they are in some way connected to a suppressive person and a suppressive person is someone who is opposed to Scientology,\" said Hines. He also commented on why John Travolta and Kelly Preston would have kept their son's affliction hidden from the public: \"It's really a big deal, so how the Travoltas dealt with this--a chronic illness in the family, I'm not sure how they would have been able to explain it.\"\nMSNBC reported that Scientology International representative Tommy Davis denied that his organization took a position on the medical disease. \"The Church of Scientology has no position on autism,\" said Davis. \"As with any medical condition, the Church believes that these matters are best diagnosed and treated by a medical doctor. Scientologists can and do then also seek spiritual assistance.\"\nThe Citizens Commission On Human Rights (CCHR), a human rights group founded by the Church of Scientology in 1969, submitted a comment on autism to a bill before the United States Senate in 2008. The bill was SB 1563: Pervasive developmental disorders. The comment by CCHR was submitted under the heading: \"Arguments in opposition\", and stated \"The Citizens Commission on Human Rights believes that there is no known medical treatment for autism except off-label drugs.\" \n\"Wikinews\" reported on views of representatives of Scientology on psychiatry in February 2009. Individuals affiliated with the Church of Scientology appeared on a program called \"The No Drug Show\", and blamed both the September 11, 2001 attacks in the United States and the attack on Pearl Harbor on psychiatrists. David Figueroa, a spokesperson for CCHR, erroneously claimed that Osama bin Laden's second in command, Ayman al-Zawahiri is a psychiatrist, as did former CCHR-International president Dennis H. Clarke. Zawahiri is actually a surgeon; he is not a psychiatrist or a psychologist.\nThe issue of Scientology's stance on psychiatry was brought to the forefront in the media during a 2005 appearance by Tom Cruise on NBC's program \"Today\" with Matt Lauer. At the time Cruise told Lauer he was critical of psychiatry and the use of antidepressants. In a December 2008 appearance on the \"Today\" show on a promotional tour for his film \"Valkyrie\", Cruise told Lauer he wanted to apologize and felt he appeared arrogant in his 2005 interview."}

He will hit the ground running, probably even faster than I would because he was down in Washington. He's going to be fine.\"\nDukakis was the preferred choice to hold the seat in the interim and was undergoing the vetting process by Patrick's administration until Kennedy's widow and sons choice of Kirk became known.\nHowever, not all reaction was positive. The head of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, Rob Jesmer called the appointment a \"power play\" by Massachusetts Democrats saying in a statement, that Kirk's appointment \"has nothing to do with principle, and everything to do with politics.\""}

Subsequently, her testimony ensured that she, Charles Manson and several others would be convicted of a string of murders in a 10-month trial, including those of heavily pregnant actress Sharon Tate and of Leno and Rosemary LaBianca.\nAtkins received another murder conviction for the separate killing of Gary Alan Hinman, bringing her total to eight murders.

This standard, similar to the all text SMS standard, allows users to send and receive video, audio, and picture files on their mobile phones. MMS was launched in 2002 and by 2007 was a common feature on most new mobile phones. It was not until June 2009, with the release of iPhone OS 3.0, that the devices also had the capability to send and receive these multimedia messages. Unfortunately for American iPhone users, all of whom use AT&amp;T because of an exclusive agreement between the phone company and Apple, AT&amp;T did not allow iPhone users to use this feature; that changed today.\nCurrent iPhone users simply need to update (from iTunes) and reboot their device in order to enable MMS. AT&amp;T was originally concerned about not having the network capacity to handle the data demand of all the MMS messages and in Wikinews' own testing this seems to be a valid issue.

These are two different things,\" Orlov testified.\nKadyrov did not appear in court but his lawyer, Andrei Krasnenkov, neither called witnesses nor questioned those brought by the defence. Krasnenkov said Orlov's words were helping destabilize Chechnya and told reporters that \"Human rights defenders are miserable people.\"\nEstemirova had been threatened several times by Kadyrov and had fled Russia previously as a result, sometimes for months. Her death prompted the closure of Memorial's Chechnyan office. She was, Kadyrov said, \"without honour or a sense of shame.\" Memorial say they hope the court case, which gets under way on October 6, will reveal new evidence of serious crimes they claim Kadyrov routinely ignores. These include extra-judicial killings, kidnap, torture, and arson attacks."}

Containing 114 protons, this is the heaviest element detected in multiple laboratories and another step towards the theorised island of stability, the \"holy grail\" of such research.\nThe elusive element was first detected in 1998 at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research, Dubna, Russia, when a plutonium target was bombarded with calcium ions accelerated in a cyclotron. Until now no other groups had been able to confirm the Russian team's results. \"It\u2019s unusual for important results like the Dubna group\u2019s claim to have produced 114 to go unconfirmed for so long,\" said Ken Gregorich, part of the Berkeley team.\nNuclear reactions producing the element occur only rarely, and once produced it decays quickly. The Berkeley experiment was run for eight days almost continuously and only two nuclei of element 114 were detected during this time. Each was a different isotope, both with 114 protons but one with 172 neutrons and one with 173. The team had to use sophisticated gas-filled separators to find these among the many other products of the collisions. To make sure their analysis of the data was correct, it was run through two independent computer programs written by different members of the team.\nBoth isotopes of 114 observed decayed to element 112 in less than a second. The superheavy elements are typically short-lived, but theorists predict a so-called \"island of stability\", a group of elements that are much more stable because they contain \"magic numbers\" of protons and neutrons. According to Gregorich: \"Based on the ideas of the 1960s, we thought when we got to element 114 we would have reached the Island of Stability\". But more recent theories suggest that heavier elements may be needed. \"The work we're doing now will help us decide which theories are correct and how we should modify our models,\" Gregorich continued.\nThe Berkeley group's results have been reported in the journal \"Physical Review Letters\"."}

Hiram Monserrate felony assault case", "text": "An emergency room doctor testified this week in the ongoing criminal trial against New York State Senator Hiram Monserrate. Monserrate faces charges of felony assault in an alleged attack on his girlfriend Karla Giraldo.\nThe prosecution has asserted that when Monserrate discovered that his girlfriend had the business card of another man, he chose to strike out at her. Monserrate has entered a plea of not guilty to charges he sliced his girlfriend's face with broken glass during a conflict at their apartment in December 2008. The defense team denied that the injury to the woman by Monserrate was intentional, instead claiming that the incident was \"an accident\" and the result of Monserrate tripping while bringing Giraldo a glass of water.\nDawne Kort, attending physician at the emergency department of Long Island Jewish Hospital, testified that Giraldo repeatedly told her she had been in a fight with Monserrate, and that he intentionally injured her with a piece of broken glass. Dr. Kort brought the situation to the attention of the police because she believed Monserrate had stabbed Giraldo \u2013 Dr. Kort also was aware that Monserrate was in the waiting room and she had concerns about Giraldo's safety.\nDr. Kort testified that Giraldo told her Monserrate had exclaimed: \"You want the water? You want the water? Here's the water!\", and then proceeded to smash a glass into Giraldo's face. Dr. Kort testified that Monserrate's girlfriend told her Giraldo and Monseratte \"were fighting and she asked for a glass of water and he shoved it in her face.\" Dr. Kort said that Giraldo cried: \"I can't believe he did this to me. My face! My face! I can't believe my face,\" on the night of December 19, 2008, while being treated in the hospital. \nAccording to Dr. Kort, another emergency physician said Monserrate had asserted the incident was an accident. When queried about how Giraldo responded to this assertion, Kort testified: \"She said many times it was not an accident. They were fighting and he took a piece of glass and cut her face.\" Giraldo had lacerations surrounding the area of her left eye which required stitches. Dr. Kort also testified as to the nature of the injuries: \"It appeared to be a stab wound. It's hospital policy that all stab wounds get reported to the police.\" \nThe testimony of Dr. Kort is in contradiction to a sworn statement given after the incident by Giraldo, as well as by arguments from defense counsel. Monserrate's lawyer Joseph Tacopina challenged Dr. Kort on cross examination, arguing that his client's girlfriend's statements to the doctor were inconsistent. Tacopina queried Dr. Kort on specifically when she wrote down notes about Giraldo's statements; Dr. Kort admitted she waited 18 days before writing down her memories of the event. When challenged by Tacopina on her ability to recall the event, Dr. Kort responded: \"This was memorable.\" \nTacopina later commented outside the court to journalists about Dr. Kort's testimony: \"I think [the doctor] is officially impeached, but I\u2019m not the fact finder that\u2019s up to the judge. Clearly, she said things very differently in the grand jury than she did on December 19, 2008 the date of the accident.\"\nChief resident at Long Island Jewish, Dr. Daniel Frogel, submitted a statement which was read in court. Dr. Frogel wrote down his memories of the event on January 2. His statement said that he recalls Giraldo told him \"it was not an accident\".\nSupreme Court Justice William Erlbaum will judge the case without a jury, as Monserrate waived his right for a trial before his peers. Monseratte's defense counsel attempted to suppress Dr. Kort's testimony in pretrial hearings. However, Justice Erlbaum ruled to allow the doctor's statement. The group National Organization for Women has requested that the judge rule Monserrate should be given \"the maximum sentence allowable by law\". If convicted, Democrat Sen. Monserrate could serve prison time and lose his New York State Senate seat. \nMonserrate is a former city councilman. He became a member of the New York State Senate weeks after the conflict with Giraldo, and was made chair of the committee overseeing consumer affairs. Along with Democrat Pedro Espada Jr., Monserrate started a shift in control of the Senate by aligning with the Republican Party."}

In the first attack, a bomber killed at least six people and wounded more than 60 others outside a police station in Bannu.\nShortly thereafter, in Peshawar's commercial district, another attacker blew himself up outside a bank affiliated with the Pakistani army, killing ten people and wounding more than 70 others. \nAuthorities in Bannu said the suicide bomber exploded a small truck full of explosives, destroying the police station and surrounding buildings.\nDistrict Police Officer Iqbal Marwat said nearby civilians were wounded, but most of the casualties were police officers. He said the attacker tried to ram the vehicle through the main gate, but then detonated the bomb after police opened fire.\nLocal media are quoted a representative for the outlawed Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan as taking responsibility for the bombing.\nIn a telephone call, Taliban spokesman warned civilians to keep away from security checkpoints and other police installations, saying that \"we have broken the silence as the government did not understand the pause in attacks, and from now there will be an increase in the number of suicide bombings.\"\nThis is the first time the alliance of more than a dozen militant groups with links to al-Qaida has claimed responsibility since its former leader Baitullah Mehsud was reportedly killed in a U.S. missile strike. Analysts had suggested the group was in disarray following Mehsud's death.\nHours later in Peshawar, officials say an attacker in a parked car threw a grenade at a crowd of people outside the Askari Bank before detonating a bomb in his car.\n\"Ten people have been killed and 71 wounded, five of them critically,\" said the chief government administrator of Peshawar, Sahibzada Anis, to the Reuters news agency.\n\"It was terrible. My children are very frightened. All the windows of my house are broken. It was very frightening,\" said Beenish Asad, a witness to the event, who lives near where the explosion took place.\nNo one has claimed responsibility for that particular attack. Senior police official Ghafoor Afridi told Voice of America that the bomber had managed to bypass multiple security checkpoints. \"There was checking all around. But somehow, it is not possible to check all vehicles, so they might have slipped a vehicle inside and exploded it,\" said Afridi. \nNorth West Frontier Province's information minister, Mian Iftikhar Hussain, said that the recent violence would not discourage government forces from fighting the rebels. \"It is not only our duty [...] to fight this menace of terrorism, it is a responsibility of the whole world. We are on the front line today, that's why our blood is being shed.\"\nHussain also said \"we are not scared of these people and we have to extend our operations wherever these terrorists are operating,\" adding that forty suspected would-be suicide bombers had been apprehended within the past several months.\nThe U.S. Embassy in Pakistan released a statement in which it condemned the bombings. \"[The attacks] highlight the vicious and inhuman nature of this enemy whose true target is the democratically elected government of Pakistan and the security of all Pakistanis,\" the embassy said.\nSaturday's attacks come as the Pakistani military works to expand its offensive against the Taliban from in and around Swat Valley to the north to South Waziristan."}

The latest violence comes days after a UN report declared August the deadliest month of the year for civilians in Afghanistan. \nThe Afghan government blamed the Taliban for the latest attack outside the southern city of Kandahar. No one has yet claimed responsibility for the incident, which killed dozens of civilians, including women and children, who were riding on the bus.\nAfghan presidential spokesman Humayoon Hamedzada said that the authorities are investigating the matter. \"We are deeply sorry for the loss of life, but our provincial authorities and the security agencies have received instructions to complete the investigations,\" he said. \nLal Jan, one of the survivors from the explosion, described his experiences. \"An explosion hit the bus. I don't know what happened. When I came to, I got out of the bus and saw that the bus was totally wrecked,\" he said.\nTuesday's explosion occurred just west of the city on a highway, where a similar blast killed three civilians a day earlier.\nProvincial police chief Sardar Mohammad Zazai claimed that \"the enemies of Afghanistan are planting mines on the main highway and killing innocent women and children.\" In a statement, the government said that \"the mine was placed by enemies of the country.\"\nLate last week, the United Nations issued a report that said it had recorded some 1,500 civilian casualties between January and August. August was this year's deadliest month, as the Taliban sought to discourage people from voting in the presidential election. The report also said almost three times as many civilian deaths were attributed to anti-government elements than to pro-government forces.\nThe spokesman for international forces in Afghanistan, US Army Colonel Wayne Shanks, said that NATO troops are working with local populations to clear the roads of Taliban bombs. \n\"Every time [the Taliban kills] innocent civilians, they are hurting themselves,\" Shanks said. \"Just like if we make a mistake and we hurt innocent civilians, we are hurting ourselves. And we are trying to absolutely fix that.\" \nMeanwhile in Pakistan, authorities say another suspected US missile strike targeted militants in South Waziristan. Officials believe the insurgents in Pakistan's tribal regions have ties to the Taliban and al-Qaeda and use the area as a base of operations for strikes in Afghanistan against foreign troops."}

The two teams consist of 18 players a side. Scores are quoted as \"goals-behinds (total)\".\nAccording to USFooty, the tournament will attract over 1000 players. The tournament will have four divisions for men and one for woman.\nInterview.\nWhere are the Nationals being played?\nRich Mann: Heritage Oak Park in Mason, Ohio (just north of Cincinnati)\nKevin Smith: This year's Nationals are being played in Mason, Ohio, just outside of Cincinnati. Previous hosts have included; Las Vegas, Nevada; the United States Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs; Nashville, Tennessee; Louisville, Kentucky; Fort Washington, Maryland (just outside of Washington, DC), just to name a few. All of the sites have a team affiliated with the region who was considered the \"host\" team. The host team this year is the Cincinnati Dockers\nAre there suitable sized fields at this location?\nRM: Yes, 5 fields\nKS: Yes. We have four divisions of men's competition ranging from developmental (division IV) to the top echelon of American play of the sport (division I), as well as one division of women's teams playing. Space is, of course, a concern, given the size of the field needed to field a full 18 side in Division's 1-3.\nThe developmental division, which tends to include new teams, and B-sides of squads participating in the higher divisions, will likely play 14 or 16 a side, with most being combined squads. Division IV, due to the smaller numbers, will be played on a smaller field, as will the women's division due to lower numbers - The field will be approximately 150 yards long and 110 wide. The women are likely to play 14 per side with the possibility of the occasional game played with 12 per side.\nOn top of all of that, there will also be free kids clinics held during the two day tournament.\nIt's important to have a full size field when fielding full squads, and given the fact that the games will take place over the two days this weekend, it's very important, when considering a site, that it be able to accommodate multiple full-size pitches.\nHow many teams are participating?\nRM: 30 men's and 8 womens\nKS: There are 24 full squads spanning the top three divisions.\nThe women's draw has seven teams fielding eight squads\nAnd Division IV has eight teams that are largely combined squads - although the Baltimore/Washington Eagles are sending a full B squad that will require no combining with extras from other teams.\nAll in all, there are 40 squads that represent 42 different teams/regions across the US and Canada - counting the women's teams as separate entities from the men's.\nWho are the defending champions?\nRM: Vancouver Mens Division One, Calgary womens\nKS: Div I - Vancouver winners against Baltimore/Washington - 4.4.28 / 2.0.12\nDiv II - Seattle winners against Calgary - 3.4.22 / 0.3.3. Note, however, that Seattle will be competing in Div I this year.\nDiv III - Kansas City winners against St Louis/Austin - 3.8.26 / 1.2.8. In this division, Kansas City will play in division II this season and Austin will continue on in III while St. Louis is paired with Ohio Valley in Division IV.\nDiv IV - Ohio Valley winners against Seattle - 6.3.39 / 2.5.17\nWomen's - Calgary Kookaburra's (incidentally, this team has an A and B squad playing in the women's draw, and is the only women's team to field to full squads)\nAre teams full 18 player teams?\nRM: Divisions 1, 2 and 3 are 18's, mens Div 4 and womens are 14-16\nKS: See the answer to question 2\nWho are the sponsors of this event?\nRM: COOPERS, Alice White/Constellation Wines, Warren County Convention and Visitors Bureau, Kings Island Resort, Brazenhead irish Pub and Makers Mark. \nAre there any plans to have a competition similar to that of the NFL (with six or seven teams) in the future?\nRM: Possibly, still in early stages of strategic planning"}

News media and critics have questioned whether Travolta and his wife Kelly Preston should have acknowledged Jett's illness sooner. In response to comments made Tuesday about the recent events on the ABC television program \"The View\", the National Autism Association issued a press release stating they \"very much support the Travolta family and all families affected by autism\".\nTravolta's testimony last week admitting that his son was autistic was the first time he had stated as much publicly; previously he and his wife had only said Jett had experienced Kawasaki syndrome. Travolta's son Jett died in January 2009 at the age of 16 after experiencing a seizure. \"My son was autistic and suffered from seizure disorder. Every five to ten days he suffered seizures which lasted 45 seconds to a minute,\" said Travolta in his court testimony on September 22. A piece in \"iVillage\" noted Travolta had been pressured for years to speak out publicly about his son Jett's autism. \"iVillage\" cited a 2007 piece in the \"New York Post\", where a source commented \"He could do so much good for autism awareness if he would just come forward.\"\nNews media and critics have suggested that Travolta and his wife's allegiance to Scientology was behind their rationale for not previously acknowledging that Jett was autistic. The Church of Scientology opposes psychiatry and does not recognize autism as an affliction. Church representative Tommy Davis had told MSNBC that \"The Church of Scientology has no position on autism,\" however a Scientology-founded organization the Citizens Commission On Human Rights stated to the United States Senate in 2008: \"The Citizens Commission on Human Rights believes that there is no known medical treatment for autism except off-label drugs.\"\nFormer Scientologists Tory Christman and Claire Headley were interviewed about the recent revelation by Travolta for \"The Daily Beast\", and commented on its implications. Christman suffers from epilepsy, a condition which also causes seizures. She told \"The Daily Beast\" that the Church of Scientology pressured her to go off of her seizure medications, and instead take \"vitamins and supplements\". After doing so, Christman experienced a grand mal seizure and knocked out two of her teeth in the bathroom. Headley, who has filed a lawsuit against Scientology for labor-law violations, told \"The Daily Beast\" that the only techniques that Scientology would have sanctioned to help Jett would have been internal procedures known as \"assists and objective processing\". Church representative Tommy Davis responded to \"The Daily Beast\": \"This religion is utterly and completely about helping. It\u2019s just insane to think that Scientology would be a factor in somebody not getting all the help they need.\"\nABC News reported Tuesday that the president of the National Autism Association (NAA), Wendy Fournier, stated those that had experience with autism awareness had previously recognized signs from media video that Jett Travolta suffered from the disease. Fournier commented: \"It didn't really come as a surprise for people. But I've read some things that really bother me - basically that they should have come forward sooner. Everybody handles autism in the best way that they can and for whatever personal reasons they had, they chose not to make it public. Just because you have a child with autism and you're a celebrity, it does not automatically mandate you to be a spokesperson for the disorder.\" Another official from the autism community, the national manager for Talk About Curing, Autism Rebecca Estepp, said to ABC News: \"The Travoltas are suffering right now from a tragedy that could affect anyone. ... We've heard of several children passing away with seizures lately.\" \nOn Tuesday's edition of the ABC television program \"The View\", co-host Whoopi Goldberg commented on the statements made by the representative of the National Autism Association to ABC News about Travolta's admission of his son's autism. \"Since John Travolta has testified his son Jett was autistic in this blackmail case, the National Autism Association has come out saying they didn't expect him to be a celebrity spokesperson for autism, but he should have come forward sooner,\" said Goldberg. \n\"The View\" co-hosts proceeded to discuss whether Travolta should have publicly revealed his son's ailment earlier, and the impact of labels in society and the media. Sherri Shepherd commented on the negative impact of labeling individuals, and guest-host Gloria Estefan remarked: \"I don't like labels, period.\" \"I guess what is stunning to me is that anyone has the right to expect you to say anything about your family,\" said Goldberg. \n\"Isn't it partly that he's a Scientologist and that there's a reputation that Scientologists don't believe in diseases of certain kinds?\" asked co-host Joy Behar. Goldberg asserted that it was the individual's decision whether or not to speak publicly about such an issue. Shepherd pointed out that celebrity actress Jenny McCarthy has spoken out publicly about autism, which her son suffers from, and noted that her voice has helped to focus public attention on the disease. \nBehar questioned Travolta's earlier statements that his son had Kawasaki disease: \"The thing about Travolta though - he called it Kawasaki disease. Did he know that it was autism, and just said it was Kawasaki - was he making that up? I don't know.\" Goldberg said: \"This is not the way to get people to come out and say, 'You know what, I'm going to take a stand.' It's just, it's none of your business until somebody wants to make it your business, but that's just me.\nAfter the program's broadcast, the National Autism Association came out with a press release Tuesday, in response to statements made on \"The View\". \"The National Autism Association stated today that they very much support the Travolta family and all families affected by autism\", said the press release. The NAA clarified that the statement made to ABC News by its president Wendy Fournier was the opposite position of that quoted by Goldberg, asserting that it was taken out of context. \"I agree with Ms. Goldberg, the Travoltas, like any other family struggling with the illness of their child, are entitled to their privacy. I have read hurtful, judgmental comments from individuals as well as organizations, suggesting that that the Travolta family owed it to the autism community to use their celebrity to bring awareness to the disorder. I couldn't disagree more,\" said Fournier.\nThe organization's board chair, Lori McIlwain, commented in the press release: \"NAA is here to support families and fellow parents. This debate does not serve anyone. As a nation, we need to instead focus on helping those affected by autism, which now affects 1 in 100 children.\" According to the release, the organization was founded in 2003, and is one of the largest in the United States. The NAA's mission includes educated families about autism and neurological disorders.\nCleveland, Ohio-based University Hospitals Case Medical Center child and adolescent psychiatrist Dr. Marcie Hall said that according to studies one fourth of autistic children may concurrently have seizure disorder. The director of the Comprehensive Epilepsy Management Center at New York City's Montefiore Medical Center, Dr. Shlomo Shinnar, stated: \"In neurologically-normal children with epilepsy, the risk of death is actually no different than for children without seizures.\""}

The court found they had failed to take their ill daughter to medical appointments, and shunned the effective conventional medical treatments offered. Instead they chose homeopathic 'alternative' medical treatments which the medical profession generally considers to be pseudoscience. As a result, their then nine-month-old malnourished daughter Gloria died of the skin disorder eczema in 2002.\nIn the evidence, the Crown prosecutor, Mr Tedeschi, said that the Sams ignored repeated advice to send Gloria to a skin specialist for her eczema. The severity of her condition made her skin so thin that it was constantly breaking and becoming infected. Creams provided by medical doctors were not used; they preferred to employ homeopathic drops as a method to treat her illness. By the time they finally sought treatment, \"her skin was weeping, her body malnourished and her corneas melting\", and she died from the complications and massive infection caused by the effectively untreated eczema.\nIn his ruling, Supreme Court Justice of New South Wales Peter Johnson stated that \"Gloria suffered helplessly and unnecessarily ... from a condition that was treatable.\"\nThomas received a maximum sentence of eight years and is no longer allowed to practice homeopathy. Manju received a maximum sentence of five years and four months. \nHomeopathy is a form of alternative medicine which uses substances that have gone through a process of serial dilution so extensive that in most cases, no molecules of the original are likely to remain. There is no convincing evidence that it has any effect greater than placebo. For it to work as homeopaths claim, basic well-tested scientific laws would have to be wrong."}

Monserrate assault trial", "text": "A crime scene police detective and a forensic biologist testified on Tuesday about bloody evidence entered into the court record, in the ongoing criminal trial against New York State Senator Hiram Monserrate. Monserrate faces charges of felony assault in an alleged attack on his girlfriend Karla Giraldo.\nThe prosecution has asserted that when Monserrate discovered that his girlfriend had the business card of another man, he chose to strike out at her. Monserrate has entered a plea of not guilty to charges he sliced his girlfriend's face with broken glass during a conflict at their apartment on December 19, 2008. The defense team denied that the injury to the woman by Monserrate was intentional, instead claiming that the incident was \"an accident\" and the result of Monserrate tripping while bringing Giraldo a glass of water.\nAn emergency physician that had treated Giraldo stated in court last Thursday that Monserrate's girlfriend asserted to her that her injuries were not the result of an accident. Though the defense has argued that Giraldo, who is from Ecuador, may have been difficult to understand \u2013 the physician stated she conversed with Monserrate's girlfriend in both Spanish and in English.\nThe police detective that first inspected the crime scene testified Tuesday to the court about his recollection of discovering broken glass at the apartment, along with blood, towels covered in blood, and a ripped women's t-shirt. Prosecutors entered into evidence a ripped sleeveless undershirt that police had found in the garbage outside Monserrate's apartment on the night of the alleged attack. Bloody towels were was also found at the crime scene in the bathroom, and bloody smudges were discovered on a light switch in the bedroom.\nAccording to forensic biologist Ewilina Badja, the majority of the blood found at the scene originated from one woman. Prosecutors assert that this woman is Giraldo, who was treated for injuries surrounding her left eye that took approximately 40 stitches to remedy. Badja identified blood on a male green shirt found in the bathroom sink as that of Monserrate.\nJoseph Tacopina, defense counsel for Monserrate, argued that the police detective's testimony does not prove his client attacked Giraldo. \"NY1\" reported that Tacopina stated: \"There's not a piece of evidence that supports there was a scuffle where someone tore someone's clothing, so it is nothing more than rank speculation. It was not a blood drenched t-shirt. When it was torn who knows? I have in my closet right now torn T-shirts that I wear to bed every night.\"\nOn cross-examination, Tacopina queried New York City Police Department crime scene analyst Detective David Hernandez regarding the blood discovered on the bedroom light switch. According to Hernandez, police did not evaluate the blood on the light switch; Hernandez also stated that the lights in the apartment were found turned on. Tacopina argued that this bolsters the story provided by defense \u2013 that his client stumbled in a dark room while attempted to bring water to his girlfriend, and placed his bloody hand on the light switch after accidentally breaking the drinking glass on Giraldo's face.\nQueens Supreme Court Justice William Erlbaum will judge the case without a jury, as Monserrate waived his right for a trial before his peers. The group National Organization for Women has requested that the judge rule Monserrate should be given \"the maximum sentence allowable by law\". If convicted, Democrat Sen. Monserrate could serve seven years in prison and lose his New York State Senate seat. \nMonserrate is a former city councilman. He became a member of the New York State Senate weeks after the alleged conflict with Giraldo, and was made chair of the committee overseeing consumer affairs. Along with Democrat Pedro Espada Jr., Monserrate started a shift in control of the Senate by aligning with the Republican Party."}

A second earthquake hit the region at 01.52 UTC on Thursday, measuring at a magnitude of 6.8, with the epicentre about 150 miles southeast of the first quake.\nThe death toll is expected to rise as rescue workers dig through the rubble, and the Indonesian health ministry said it believes that the death toll could go into the thousands. Hundreds of people are believed seriously injured. As of 13.00 UTC, a disaster ministry official said that the official death toll was at 770, with 290 people being heavily wounded and a further 2,090 receiving light injuries.\nHowever, prime minister Jusuf Kalla said that the true death toll was \"definitely higher\" than the current statistics, due to difficulties recovering bodies. \"It's hard to tell because there is heavy rain and a blackout,\" Kalla said.\nMost of the deaths have been reported in the Sumatra city of Padang, where at least 500 buildings were toppled by the quake. A hospital, hotel, and school facilities were among the buildings destroyed in Padang, a coastal city of 900,000.\nPadang's mayor, Fauzi Bahar, asked for help on Indonesian radio. \"We really need help. We call on people to come to Padang to evacuate bodies and help the injured,\" he said, saying that his city was \"overwhelmed\" by the earthquake.\nSusilo Bambang Yudhoyono, the country's president, visited some of the areas most affected by the disaster. \"I ask rescue workers to continue working in teams with clear goals to keep looking for survivors\" he said. \"[...] This is a natural disaster, so let us remain strong in dealing with it.\" \nTiti Moektijasih from the United Nations Office of Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said that the current disaster recovery efforts were not sufficient. \"Compared to the extent of the damage, you see there should be more equipment, more people to do this,\" she told the AFP news agency.\nThe Red Cross' head of operations in Indonesia, Bob McKerrow, told the BBC news agency that it was difficult to dispatch personnel to affected areas due to poor infrastructure. \"it's just such a vast area to be working in with such bad infrastructure,\" he said. \"[...] The roads and bridges have all been damaged, so [there is] a challenge ahead of us.\" McKerrow said that 400 personnel, among them fifty doctors, had arrived in Indonesia by airplane on Thursday.\nIndonesian health minister Siti Fadilah Supari said that a mall and two hospitals in Padang were destroyed by the tremors. \"This is a high-scale disaster, more powerful than the earthquake in Yogyakarta in 2006 when more than 3,000 people died,\" he said.\nIndonesia's government has sent medical teams and military planes to help with relief efforts, and announced $10 million in emergency aid. The British Red Cross started a fundraiser to help people affected by the earthquake.\nThe earthquakes were the latest in a string of natural and man-made disasters to hit the sprawling archipelago of 226 million people.\nIndonesia is prone to seismic upheaval due to its location on the so-called Pacific Ring of Fire, an arc of volcanoes and fault lines encircling the Pacific Basin. In 2004, a 9.1-magnitude earthquake along the same fault line caused a massive tsunami that killed more than 200,000 people in a dozen countries.\nScientists had warned that a severe earthquake might strike the area for some time, however, Indonesia did not have sufficient funds to pay for disaster preparation measures, the Al Jazeera news agency reported."}

The resultant inquiry sought to clarify tariffs levied on solar panels imported from China, imports which, for nearly two decades, were considered a duty-free commodity.\nIn early January, U.S. Customs officials reportedly informed the company that the solar panels contained electronic devices that place the panels in the electric generator import category which is subject to a 2.5% import tariff. Specifically, the ruling cited the presence of diodes on the solar panels as evidence of electric generation and hence they must be treated as an electric generator. Small solar panels already incur a 3.9% tariff. The January decision was made by a U.S. trade specialist whose rulings can be overturned.\nThe tariffs will be levied on imported panels that provide electricity for all uses. Additionally, tariffs will be collected dating from the beginning of 2009. The Solar Energy Industries Association estimates that the accumulated tariffs from this year may total more than US$ 70 million. This week's tariff revelation caught many industry leaders off-guard and yesterday the Solar Industries Association moved to block the tariff. The Association president, Rhone Resch, stated \"... We're taking it [the tariff] very seriously and we will be responding. ... The industry is in the process of preparing a challenge\". The Association intends to file their appeal with senior U.S. Customs officials who have the option to overrule the decision to implement the tariff. However, if the officials do not revoke the tariff, then the case must go before the U.S. Court of International Trade.\nThe U.S. amount spent on imported solar panels roughly matches the income from exported panels; US$ 605 million imported versus US$ 555 million exported, according to the Commerce Department figures on the first seven months of this year. Major solar panel importers have already begun to move their operations to the U.S."}

Amazon would also pay KamberEdelson, the plaintiffs' firm, US$150,000 in legal fees, with the proviso that it go to charity.

But Aziz says he expects the military to change its strategy in the mountainous and isolated region of South Waziristan.\n\"We are going to see the first snowfall in that region, and it becomes even more difficult to fight there,\" he said. \"So one foresees counter-terrorist operations rather than large-scale military operations as in Swat.\"\nHe says that type of strategy would drain the militants of their resources and put the military in a better position to respond to any threats that might arise elsewhere in the country.\nThe government insists it is not launching any major operation in South Waziristan at the moment. But UN officials say about 80,000 civilians have fled the tribal area in anticipation of a new military offensive.\nThe IMU is a militant group that was formed in 1998.

The treaty was mainly supported by the Fianna F\u00e1il, Fine Gael and Labour parties amongst others and was opposed mainly by the Sinn F\u00e9in Party and Libertas. The Irish rejected the Lisbon Treaty in June 2008 when 53% of the population voted against the Twenty-eighth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland that covered the ratification in a referendum. Since 2007 the Lisbon treaty has undergone a series of ratification votes and reviews in all of the current 27 member-states. Ireland was the only state to require both a parliamentary vote and a popular referendum. \nThe Lisbon Treaty is a number of amendments to the Treaty on the European Union and the Treaty Establishing the European Community, which was later renamed the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. Some of the major tenets of the Lisbon Treaty include the legitimization of the European Central Bank, revisions to European Court of Justice powers, a restructing of EU-level legislative institutions, and the establishment of the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. Also, the treaty allows for the election of an EU President for two and one-half years by the executives of each member-nation.\nWith the treaty now passed in Ireland, the Czech Republic and Poland will make a final review. In the Czech Republic, the parliament has already passed a bill supporting the treaty however, the signature of Czech President Vaclav Klaus is required. Senators from the Czech Parliament have filed a complaint with the Czech Constitutional Court on the grounds that the treaty violates their constitution. Legally, the president cannot ratify the treaty until the Court makes a decision. Poland must also sign-off on the treaty before it can be enacted. The Polish parliament also has approved the treaty but Polish President, Lech Kaczynski, must also sign the document. Thus, while Ireland's referendum is important in the ratification process, the Czech Republic and Poland must still approve."}

The accident occurred in Periyar National Park located in the city of Kerala. The bodies of a mother, her child and one other individual were among the latest victims pulled from the water.\nOn Wednesday, a boat carrying 75 people, mainly women and children, was returning from a fair that marked the end of the Durga Puja, an annual Hindu festival celebrating the worship of the Hindu goddess Durga. Fifteen people, including the boat driver and two staff members, were able to swim to safety after the boat capsized, but officials believe there are no other survivors. Reports say the person driving the boat turned sharply to one side before it capsized.\n\"Wikinews\" obtained exclusive pictures of the boat before and after the accident. Images show the boat significantly leaning to one side shortly before the accident occurred. A later image shows the boat almost entirely submerged as rescue workers frantically work to rescue the trapped passengers.\nAccording to the \"Indian Express\", the boat was being operated by workers who were not trained in rescue tactics had the boat been suddenly damaged. The paper also claims that of the two person crew, a driver and a lascar named Victor Samuel, neither were assigned direct control of the boat. The paper also says the boat was not licensed to operate in the area it was traveling. The paper cites a 1921 law, which says the driver must watch over the engine while another crew member, a 'srank', drives the vessel, but no one in that position was aboard the vessel when it capsized. Samuel said that he only obtained his lascar license one year ago, contradicting earlier reports that suggested he had more than 15 years of experience driving similar boats.\nOfficials are continuing to investigate the incident. So far, no criminal charges have been filed. The boat was made of mostly fiberglass, had two decks and was owned an operated by the Kerala Tourism Development Corporation, a government-owned company. According to reports, Samuel was only licensed to operate wooden boats and had no experience driving ones made of fiberglass. Samuel and the two staff members have been suspended pending the results of the investigation."}

The clashes come after Senegalese rebels in the area started stepping up their attacks.\nThe soldiers were returning from patrol in the Niagha district along Senegal's border with Guinea Bissau when they were ambushed in an attack thought to have been carried out by rebels from the Casamance Movement of Democratic Forces (MFDC).\nIt was one of the deadliest attacks against Senegalese troops in recent years, and comes a day after gunmen killed one person and wounded three others in an attack on a taxi in the region. A reporter for Voice of America in Casamance said that more than 1,000 civilians have fled the area near the Bissau border and are camping along the national highway toward Ziguinchor.\nThe Senegalese air force last month bombed rebel bases near Ziguinchor after suspected MFDC fighters killed a soldier at an army outpost. Two people were killed in an attack on a bus in August.\nThe Casamance is Senegal's southern district, separated geographically from the rest of the country by Gambia. The rebellion there is one of Africa's longest-running conflicts.\nIt was originally begun as a separatist movement of ethnic Dioula fighting for greater autonomy from the government in Dakar. A 2004 peace accord restored order in Casamance and led to hopes that the region might once again become a valuable tourist destination. But attacks have grown this year, with rebels accusing President Abdoulaye Wade's government of neglecting the people of Casamance, who produce much of the nation's grain.\nLocal government officials are calling for renewed talks with the MFDC movement. A communiqu\u00e9 last month, attributed to the head of one of the group's factions, said the rebels prefer negotiations but were provoked by the military in recent clashes. In a nation-wide address last month, the president denounced the recent violence and vowed to pursue peace efforts with the MFDC.\nSome analysts have also voiced concerns that recent conflicts in the neighbouring country of Guinea-Bissau, where dozens of anti-government demonstrators were killed by government security forces, could spill over into Senegal and other states such as Liberia and Sierra Leone."}

Countries in sub-Saharan Africa are particularly vulnerable. \nThe report from the International Food Policy Research Institute projects that the the number of malnourished children will decrease by 10 million in the next 40 years. However, without global warming the report projects a decrease of 35 million. Forty percent of undernourished children will live in Africa.\nThe report compares economic and biological factors affecting child nutrition in two future scenarios \u2014 a world with and a world without climate change.\nGerard Nelson is lead researcher for the report at the International Food Policy Research Institute. He said that climate change will have a particularly strong impact on agricultural yields in sub-Saharan Africa.\n\"The food price crisis of last year really was a wake-up call to a lot of people that we are going to have 50% more people on the surface of the Earth by 2050. Meeting those demands for food coming out of population growth is going to be a huge challenge \u2014 even without climate change,\" Nelson said.\n\"On top of that, sub-Saharan Africa in particular is home to a large number of poor people. And one of the key messages to take home from our analysis is that with higher incomes people are more resilient to a variety of changes and that will be especially true for climate change.\"\nThe report says that in 2050 average wheat yields in sub-Saharan Africa will decline by up to 22 percent as a result of climate change. Irrigation water supply is also expected to decrease and less food availability will mean on average 500 calories less per person.\nWithout climate change, the report projected a rise in calorie availability in Sub-Saharan Africa in 2050.\nNelson says African governments need to prioritise investment in the agriculture sector, particularly in rural roads, research and new technologies. With the December 2009 climate change talks in Copenhagen, Denmark, Nelson says African governments should focus on helping their farmers adapt to climate change.\n\"As the governments of sub-Saharan Africa prepare to go to the Copenhagen negotiations they should ensure that agriculture is included both in the adaptation funding mechanisms that will come out of Copenhagen as well as allow for the possibility that mitigation funds can be used in Africa,\" Nelson said.\nThe report says an additional investment in global agriculture of US$7 billion per year could increase production and counteract the adverse effects of climate change. The report says 40 percent of this investment should go to sub-Saharan Africa."}

Prime Minister Fran\u00e7ois Fillon has confirmed the government is considering such a move.\nChemical castration is different from physical castration in that it stops being effective if treatment is stopped, making it reversible. It works by using hormones and significantly reduces a target's libido.\nThe move follows new measures Poland introduced in September to force some paedophiles to be castrated. Germany, Belgium, and parts of the United States have similar laws, and France is among European countries such as Sweden that offer castration voluntarily to convicted sex offenders.\n\"Chemical castration exists today, it just depends on an agreement by the person concerned,\" said Fillon. \"We have to look at how, as part of surveillance and control measures after someone leaves prison, we might make this more restrictive if necessary.\" He also told reporters that the government is \"not ruling out any line of reflection on any subject\" following a ministers' meeting on crime prevention. He said castration may be made \"more obligatory\".\nThe debate was triggered by last week's slaying of Marie-Christine Hodeau, who called police to say she had been shut in the back of a car and told them its manufacturer and registration number before being cut off. A manhunt began and a suspect was quickly arrested, but Hodeau was already dead. Her killer confessed to strangling her and led police to her body.\nIt later emerged that the same man had earlier been imprisoned for the abduction and rape of a thirteen-year-old girl. After serving his sentence, he had returned to live in the same village as the girl he had raped.\nThe possibility has been met with both approval and opposition from French politicians. The ruling 's spokesman had already asked for the measures, and they were also sought by Justice Minister , although she wanted castration to remain voluntary despite tougher laws surrounding it. However, socialist opposition spokesman Beno\u00eet Hamon described forced castration as a \"deplorable\" and \"indecent\" scheme that might breach international legislation."}

Its premise is derived from a joke statement made by about fellow comedian . The joke was first applied to Beck on the Internet discussion community . It then became popular on Internet social media sites including and , and was the subject of a , a technique where individuals link phrases in order to artificially change Google search results. \nEiland-Hall saw the discussion on Fark, and created a website about it. The website asserts it does not believe the rumors to be true, and states: \"But we think Glenn Beck definitely uses tactics like this to spread lies and misinformation.\" In an interview with \"\", he said the website was \"using Beck's tactics against him\". The website was created on September 1, and by September 3 attorneys for Beck's company took action. Beck's lawyers sent letters to the where they referred to the domain name itself as \"defamatory\", but they failed to get the site removed.\nBeck filed a formal complaint with the Switzerland-based agency of the United Nations, the .

A lawyer for Beck declined to provide a comment to the \"\", however a source told the newspaper that Beck's complaint with the site is primarily a \"trademark issue\".\nRandazza established an attorney-client relationship with Eiland-Hall after his client received threatening letters from attorneys representing Beck. He then sent an email to Beck's attorneys, and pointed out inconsistencies between their client's recent actions and his prior public statements in support of the First Amendment. Randazza wrote a reply to the World Intellectual Property Organization, and contends that the website is \"protected political speech\", because it is \"satirical political humor\". Randazza stated that \"Even an imbecile would look at this Web site and know that it\u2019s a parody.\" In his legal brief, Randazza compared the website to other , such as \" and video parodies of the German film \". \n\"We are here because Mr. Beck wants Respondent's website shut down. He wants it shut down because Respondent's website makes a poignant and accurate satirical critique of Mr. Beck by parodying Beck's very rhetorical style,\" wrote Randazza in the brief. The brief also commented on Beck's style of reporting, and pointed out a controversial statement made by Beck when he interviewed a Muslim member of the United States Congress. Beck said to Representative : \"I like Muslims, I've been to mosques. ... And I have to tell you, I have been nervous about this interview because what I feel like saying is, sir, prove to me that you are not working with our enemies.\" According to the , the website's joke premise takes advantage of \"a perceived similarity between Beck's rhetorical style and the Gottfried routine\".\nPublic interest attorney Paul Levy told \"Ars Technica\" that if a statement in a website's domain name were both false and \"stated with actual malice\", it is possible it could be considered defamatory. \"\" reported that attorney Corynne McSherry gave an analysis asserting that though the domain name of the website is \"pretty dramatic\", it constituted \"pure political criticism and there's nothing wrong with that\". McSherry and Levy both agreed that the action of Beck to take the matter to the World Intellectual Property Organization was probably a tactic to determine the identity of the website's owner.\nAndy Carvin of \"\" wrote that Randazza's legal brief was amusing, commenting: \"It's not often that I would recommend reading a World Intellectual Property Organization legal brief for its entertainment value, but today is going to be an exception.\" Nate Anderson of \"Ars Technica\" commented \"In any event, the WIPO battle promises to be entertaining, and there's even a bit of serious purpose mixed in with the frivolity.

The faint dust ring extends up to 7.4 million miles (12 million km) from the planet and could fit over a billion Earths inside it, making it the largest in the Solar System. It could also solve a mystery about one of Saturn's moons that has puzzled scientists for centuries.\nThe ring was found with the help of NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope, with details published today in the journal \"Nature\". It is thought to consist of ice and dust from Saturn's moon Phoebe, which is kicked up by collisions with comets and then drifts in towards the planet. The ring and moon both orbit in a plane inclined at 27 degrees to the other rings.\n\"This is one supersized ring,\" said Dr Anne Verbiscer of the University of Virginia, one of the authors of the paper. Of Saturn's other rings, the largest is the E-ring, a mere 150,000 miles (240,000 km) in diameter. Jupiter also has \"gossamer rings\" of a similar diameter to the E-ring. If the Phoebe ring was visible from Earth, it would appear twice as large in the sky as the full Moon.\nHowever the newly found ring is extremely faint. It is made up of dust particles around 10 microns (thousandths of a millimetre) in size, and according to Verbiscer, \"In a cubic km of space, there are all of 10-20 particles.\" This explains why it has evaded discovery until now. \"If you were standing in the ring itself, you wouldn't even know it.\"\nThe Phoebe ring does not reflect much visible light, but the Spitzer telescope was able to pick up the dust's faint infra-red glow. The telescope, launched in 2003, orbits the Sun and is roughly 66 million miles (107 million km) from Earth. It is one of NASA's four Great Observatories.\nThe discovery could also finally account for the unusual appearance of Iapetus, another of the planet's moons. When Iapetus was first observed in 1671 by astronomer Giovanni Cassini, its leading side was seen to be much darker than the other. Until now scientists had been unsure why this was. Now it is thought that the moon orbits in the opposite direction to the ring, and as Iapetus moves through the ring, dust builds up on its front surface. Verbiscer likens it to \"bugs on a windshield.\"\n\"Astronomers have long suspected that there is a connection between Saturn's outer moon Phoebe and the dark material on Iapetus,\" said Douglas Hamilton, another author of the paper. The material has been found to have a similar composition to Phoebe's surface. \"This new ring provided convincing evidence of that relationship.\"\nThis is the second major discovery for astronomers studying Saturn in the past month. In September, evidence from the Cassini orbiter showed that Saturn's other rings were far less flat than expected."}

US President Barack Obama has made clear that extending health insurance coverage to as many Americans as possible is his top domestic priority.\nRepublican lawmakers, however, are still overwhelmingly opposed to the bill, saying it is too expensive and would expand the role of government in people's health care.\nObama and his fellow Democrats in the Senate received some good news late Wednesday from the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office, which put the total cost of the Senate Finance Committee's health care bill at $829 billion over the next decade, below Obama's stated goal of $900 billion. The budget watchdog organization also said the health care bill would help reduce the federal budget deficit over the next ten years.\nHarry Reid said he believed health care reform was moving forward. \"And so today we stand closer than ever to fulfilling that fundamental promise, one for which we have fought for more than 60 years,\" he said.\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, however said that the cost estimate was \"irrelevant\", because the final bill that will actually emerge from both houses of Congress is likely to look very different and cost a lot more. \"What matters is that the final bill will cost about a trillion dollars, vastly expand the role of government in people's health care decisions, increase premiums and limit choice,\" McConnell said.\nMcConnell said Republicans favor a step by step approach to health care reform, focusing on prevention and wellness programs and dealing with the high costs of malpractice insurance doctors have to pay due to fears of excessive lawsuits.\nUnder the Finance Committee's bill, US residents would be required to get health insurance or face a penalty, and insurance companies would face tough new regulations. For example, insurance companies could no longer reject coverage for people due to pre-existing conditions.\nThe Senate Finance Committee is likely to pass the bill, which will then have to be merged with one passed by the Senate health committee before it goes to the full Senate floor for debate."}

I urge them to listen to the voices of Kenyans.\" \nAnnan said that he had noted some progress on the reform agenda but warned that time was running out. \nPolitically-fueled ethnic tensions flared up in early 2008 following a disputed presidential election, plunging Kenya into weeks of deadly turmoil. \nFlown in to mediate the crisis, Annan led the two sides to a power-sharing agreement that made incumbent candidate Mwai Kibaki president and his rival, , prime minister. The deal brought an end to the clashes, but has resulted in a bloated coalition government unchallenged by a real political opposition.\nAs part of the agreement between the two principle rivals, the new government agreed to undergo a far-reaching reform agenda to prevent the tensions from boiling over in the next election. Critics claim that the government has not followed through on its commitments, an accusation the government strongly denies. \n\u201cKenya is already at \u2014 or past \u2014 the halfway mark between the formation of the Coalition Government and the next electoral cycle. Kenya cannot afford a recurrence of the crisis and violence that engulfed it after the 2007 election. But that is a serious risk if tangible reform is not achieved,\u201d Annan said, warning that the government's term is already halfway expired and the 2012 elections are quickly approaching. \nOvershadowing the former UN chief's remarks was a BBC report released on Wednesday that claimed that ethnic groups in the regions most hit by the 2008 violence are now stockpiling guns to prepare for 2012. \nThe 2008 conflict, the nation's worst since its independence more than 45 years ago, was carried out chiefly by machete-wielding gangs in the slums and in the affected rural areas by tribal militias armed primarily with spears and bows and arrows.\nHassan Omar, vice chairman of the Kenyan National Commission on Human Rights, said that his group has also received reports about groups purchasing firearms but has as yet been unable to independently verify the claims.\n\"The allegations are becoming more and more credible,\" Omar said. \"The Kenya National Commission [on Human Rights] did have these allegations, and we had not necessarily undertaken the time of investigation or documentation towards proving their existence.\" \nAccording to the private fears expressed by a senior parliamentary official, another flare-up similar to the 2008 turmoil has the potential to fragment the nation into regional power-centers run by tribal warlords, given the country's current political climate and simmering ethnic tensions.\nHowever, Kenyan cabinet minister William Ruto, a political leader of one of the ethnic groups named by the BBC report for buying the guns, dismissed the claims as rumors. \"The people making these allegations should either come forward with substance to their claims, or they should shut up,\" said Ruto; \"I don't think rumor mongering is going to take this country anywhere.\" \nThe United States has threatened fifteen senior Kenyan officials with travel bans if the reform process is perceived as continuing to stall."}

British tabloid \"News of the World\" revealed the information from the BBC One programme in their newspaper on Sunday.\nBy Monday, it had emerged that there had been 63 complaints to the corporation. Since Thursday, the racist comment by du Beke has caused a total of 487 complaints to the BBC. Du Beke has since apologised to Rouass for the comment.\nBruce Forsyth, who presents the show alongside Tess Daly, had an unscheduled interview with radio show TalkSport on Wednesday. During the interview he said that, in days gone by, the remark would not have been treated so seriously. He said: \"You go back 25, 30, 40 years and there has always been a bit of humour about the whole thing. \n\"Americans used to call us 'limeys' which doesn't sound very nice, but we used to laugh about it. Everybody has a nickname,\" Forsyth stated to the BBC Radio 5 Live show. \"I'm sure there was nothing vindictive about what he [Anton du Beke] said...the page should be closed on it.

But when you're like that you can slip up every now and again. You can say something that you don't mean.\" \nAs a result of the comments made by Bruce Forsyth, the Victoria Derbyshire show received a record 600 complaints from listeners. Afterwards, Forsyth apologised for the comments he made on the show, and released a statement on Thursday saying: \"To be absolutely clear, the use of racially offensive language is never either funny or acceptable.\" A spokesperson for the BBC has also said: \"The BBC does not condone offensive language in the workplace. Anton du Beke has apologised to Laila, who has accepted his apology.\"\nKulvinder Ghir, an actor from Asia, showed his dissatisfaction for what was said on the radio show, stating: \"Claiming the word paki is harmless is just ignorance.\"\nThere has been calls made from viewers to the BBC over the last few days to dismiss Anton du Beke from Strictly Come Dancing. Earlier this year, former The One Show presenter Carol Thatcher was dismissed from ITV1 reality TV show \"I'm A Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here!\" due to racist remarks she made while on the programme. Despite this incident, the BBC have decided not to sack Anton du Beke from the BBC One dancing show.\nThe BBC has now had 686 complaints since Friday, an increase of 199 complaints from Thursday."}
