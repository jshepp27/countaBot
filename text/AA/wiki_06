According to an agreement signed on Tuesday Citgo, the Houston-based subsidiary of Venezuela's state-owned oil company, will provide 12 million gallons of discounted home heating oil. The oil will be distributed through two nonprofit organizations, Citizens Energy Corp. and the Mass Energy Consumer Alliance.\nIn August William Delahunt (D-Mass) met President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez in Caracas. The meeting between a member of Congress and a head of state so critical of the White House, sparked negotiations that led to the deal. Mr Delahunt said he was simply trying to smooth strained US-Venezuelan relations while helping low-income people in his home state.\nHugo Ch\u00e1vez says he is leading a Bolivarian Revolution and calls his program an act of justice for poor Americans, whom he says have been neglected by their government. Mr Ch\u00e1vez is one of Latin America's harshest critics of U.S.-style capitalism, which he calls a major cause of poverty.\nVenezuela has been selling fuel on preferential terms to countries across Latin America and the Caribbean, extending low-interest loans and accepting partial payment in goods ranging from bananas to sugar. \nCritics said Delahunt should not be working so closely with Ch\u00e1vez, an outspoken leftist. Steve Johnson, a Latin American specialist at the conservative oriented Heritage Foundation, said \"Meeting with the leader who calls himself a revolutionary populist is not something I'd like my congressman to be doing.\"\nRepresentative Delahunt said \"This is a humanitarian gesture,\" and that his constituents' needs for heating assistance trump any political points the Chavez administration can score. Asked if he was subverting State Department policy toward Ch\u00e1vez, Mr Delahunt said, \"I don't work for Condoleezza Rice. I don't report to the State Department. I report to the people who elected me in the state of Massachusetts. I belong to an independent branch of government.\"\nOver 10 percent of US oil imports come from Venezuela, and while Mr Ch\u00e1vez seeks to diversify his markets, the US remains his leading trade partner.\nWhen the discounted oil arrives early December Citizens Energy will determine suitable recipients with the help of local organizations that serve the poor. 350 local dealers will then distribute three-fourths of the oil to local families. \nThe remaining quarter will be distributed or sold to homeless shelters, food banks, and low-income housing groups by MassEnergyConsumer Alliance. Larry Chretien, the nonprofit group's executive director says home heating oil prices are expected to increase by 30 percent to 50 percent this winter because of rising oil prices. The CITGO agreement could help ease the crunch on some families."}

Harold Mitchell from Mitchell and Partners says the Howard Government spent $26 million on TV advertising in October. The figure is more than any other entity including retailing giant Coles Myer.\nIn October, 11,000 commercials were part of the campaign to sell its Industrial Relations (IR) reforms. Mr Mitchell said he could not recall a larger single monthly spending spree in Australian advertising history.\n\"There's never been a campaign in history as big as that,\" he said. \"It followed of course the ACTU campaign which was something like, maybe one fifth of that size.\"\nHe said the Government was the second biggest advertiser in Australia this year, having spent an estimated $117 million from January to the end of October. Only the supermarket and department store group Coles Myer has spent more in the same period \u2013 $156 million. Coles Myer spent $19 million last month.\nOf the Government's October advertising bill, $15 million went on TV ads, a 168 per cent increase on the bill for October 2004. The advertising blitz followed the ACTU campaign against the changes, which Mr Mitchell says came in at about one-fifth of the government's bill.\nThe Nielsen Media Research spokesman said the figures are estimates of the cost of placing the advertisements and did not include their production. \nOn top of the TV spots, the Federal government spent more than $20 million on outdoor and print advertising. Plus another $4 million to $5 million on a nationwide pamphlet mail-out.\nAt the current rate spending will overtake the record $211 million spent selling the Goods and Services Tax (GST) over four years, and leaves all Australian company spending on advertising in the shade. The Government has earmarked $55 million to the IR campaign. \nThe professor of marketing at Australian Graduate School of Management, John Roberts, said the intensity of the advertising had become counterproductive. He said people who disagreed with the policy simply had their feelings reinforced by the endless advertising, while others had become \"habituated\" by the deluge and ignored the ads.\n\"It's hard to believe they have done any research on this,\" he said. \"There is this naive belief you get sometimes in management that if a campaign is not working properly you simply open the spigot a bit more, but it doesn't work that way.\"\nBusiness groups have launched their own campaign supporting the changes too. Yet despite the spending on advertising, two polls this week attributed a sharp drop in the popularity of the Prime Minister, John Howard, and the Government, to the planned IR (WorkChoice) changes.\nAustralian Democrats workplace relations spokesman Andrew Murray \"You just shouldn't as a government be advertising prior to legislation before the Senate. It's immoral,\" Senator Murray said.\nOpposition public accountability spokesman Kelvin Thomson said the campaign had cost taxpayers $1.7 million a day but had flopped, with Australians unconvinced that they would be better off under the changes. \"It is an obscene waste of $55 million of public money used to fund a highly political flop,\" Mr Thomson said."}

Water supplies are being shipped in amidst a relative calm, Thursday. Local officials have suggested normal water supplies may resume in some form as early as Sunday.\nAn explosion at a workshop of the No. 101 Chemical Plant of the Jilin Petrochemical Company in Jilin City on November 13 resulted in the accidental release of benzene and benzene-like organic compounds, including nitrobenzene, into the Songhua River. The upstream position of the plant relative to the Chinese city of Harbin made the pollution a risk to the health of its populace; the solution of ceasing public water production will leave more than 3.8 million people without public drinking water for three or more days. Harbin, the capital of the neighboring Heilongjiang province, is located about 380km (230 miles) from the plant and is itself located near the middle of the 1,897\u00a0km long Songhua River\u2013from which it derives the majority of its water supplies. Benzene is a carcinogen, and the levels initially released into the Songhua River were 108 times the national safety levels for the country. By November 21, the polluted area included roughly 80 kilometers of the Songhua River.\nThe State Environmental Protection Administration (SEPA) as well as local experts and officials have worked on a pollution-control campaign and emergency schemes have been launched by the two provincial governments to limit the effects of the environmental incidents. Jilin also quickly acted to block the further entry of the pollutants into the river and released large volumes of water from a reservoir in order to dilute them; at this time, Harbin added active carbon powders in quantities reaching 1,400 tons and more in order to purify the water. The densities of the benzene and nitrobenzene substances in the river near Jilin have dropped to levels within the state safety guidelines since the accidental release. The water that will pass through Harbin is expected to contain only small amounts of the toxic pollutants and to pass through Friday morning based upon its current speed. In preparation for the passage of these pollutants, the municipal government of Harbin has established an emergency medical care system composed of 15 hospitals to treat residents that may be exposed to contamination.\nZhang Dingbang, deputy secretary of the municipal government, said, at the first press conference since the incident that was held Wednesday, that Harbin is drilling 100 new wells in order to obtain 80,000 tons of underground water in addition to its current output from 918 wells of 320,000 tons every day. Nevertheless, thousand of tons of purified water have been provided by neighboring regions and enterprise donations, which will further increase this supply. Harbin residents have collected more than 300,000 tons of water as of Tuesday. Liu Yuzhu, a senior official with the municipal water supply and drainage corporation, has said that this supply is expected to provide for the daily average use of 18,600 tons per day for the three days required for the clear passage of the pollutants through the area."}

A dozen war protesters were arrested Wednesday for camping near President Bush's ranch in defiance of new local bans on roadside camping and parking. The protests have been planned during President Bush's six day Thanksgiving visit to his ranch. \nThe protest was an act of civil disobedience, said Hadi Jawad, co-founder of the Crawford Peace House, \"We want to challenge the encroachment of our civil rights\". It was aimed to contest new regulations established by McLennan County commissioners banning parking and camping around the roads leading to President George W Bush's ranch. The constitutionality of these regulations, effected by a 3-2 vote in September, have been challenged in court by the Texas Civil Rights Project, and the U.S District for Waco refused their motion for a temporary restraining order over the enforcement of these new regulations while the case is heard. The new rules were established following the much larger protests led by Cindy Sheenan earlier this year. \nAmong the protestors were Daniel Ellsberg, a former military analyst and political activist, whose exposure of the Pentagon Papers brought to light the Nixon administration's attempt to \"spin\" the Vietnam War; Ann Wright, a senior US diplomat who resigned her post over the decision to invade Iraq; and an Iraq war veteran. Ellsberg was among those arrested.\nThe White House has refused to comment on the return of the protestors."}

It is a double attack on the freedom of the press and freedom of information.\" Mr. Dear continued, \"These sort of attempts to stifle uncomfortable revelations printed in a newspaper, which is only carrying out its proper duty to inform the British public, does the government of what is supposed to be a democracy no credit whatsoever.\"\nAccording to The Guardian this \"is believed to be the first time the Blair government has threatened newspapers in this way\". The British government has before obtained court injunctions against newspapers, but never prosecuted editors for publishing contents of leaked documents. \nFormer British defence minister Peter Kilfoyle earlier called for the full text of the memo to be published. \"I believe that Downing Street ought to publish this memo in the interests of transparency, given that much of the detail appears to be in the public domain\". He added \"If it was the case that President Bush wanted to bomb al-Jazeera in what is after all a friendly country, it speaks volumes and it raises questions about subsequent attacks that took place on the press that wasn't embedded with coalition forces.\"\nTuesday, the \"Daily Mirror\", a British tabloid, ran a front page story under the headline \"Bush plot to bomb his ally\", citing the memo in question (see previous story). In response to the attorney general, the \"Daily Mirror\" said it had \"essentially agreed to comply\". Boris Johnson, MP for Henley and editor of \"The Spectator\" magazine, has condemned the Attorney General's actions and offered to risk jail by printing the memo if he receives it within the next few days.\nThe \"Washington Post\" cited an unnamed senior Washington diplomat saying that the Bush remark as reported by the \"Daily Mirror\" \"sounds like one of the president's one-liners that is meant as a joke.\" But, the diplomat said, \"it was foolish for someone to write it down, and now it will be a story for days.\"\nThe meeting between Bush and Blair occurred on April 16, 2004, at the height of the US assault on Fallujah. According to some reports, al-Jazeera was the only major news organisation providing eyewitness reports and video footage from within the city at the time. \nThere is a history of enmity between senior U.S. officials and al-Jazeera. Vice President Dick Cheney has said that the network ran the risk of being labeled \"Osama [bin Laden]'s outlet to the world\", and Pentagon chief Donald Rumsfeld has called its coverage \"outrageous\" and \"inexcusably biased\".\nAl-Jazeera's news bureau in Kabul was destroyed by a U.S. missile during the aerial assault on the Taliban. The Pentagon later stated it did not know that the network's offices were in the building. Al-Jazeera's Baghdad bureau was also hit by US forces, resulting in the death of an al-Jazeera journalist during the April 2003 assault on Baghdad. The Pentagon claimed U.S. troops were responding to enemy fire from the building. "}

The speeches were followed by a musical program, but the crowd soon started dispersing to escape the weather. Trade unions organized transport for 40,000 people to attend, but many buses were stuck in traffic jams on snowy roads and arrived too late for the protest. The police estimated the number of protesters to 25,000."}

The project has residents concerned about the prospect of having imprisoned detainees and possible terrorism suspects as neighbours. \nChristmas Islanders fear the remote detention facility will be Australia's very own \"Guantanamo Bay.\" \nThe island's Shire President, Gordon Thompson, says residents are also worried about the effects the controversial detention centre development will have on the island's tourism industry. \"We're not building tourism based on a prison tour,\" he said, also voicing fears that residents would be barred from areas on the northwest point of the island. He said locals were confused and did not know if the centre would just be used for refugees or as a Guantanamo-style prison. Another resident complained that access to popular fishing and snorkelling spots on the island would be limited. \nDepartment of Immigration (DIMIA) said that when construction of the Christmas Island facility was finished, a review was likely to be taken to close some mainland detention centres such as Baxter in South Australia. \"Its (Christmas Island) only use is as an immigration reception and processing centre,\" said a DIMIA spokesperson.\nMr Thompson, who is opposed to the imprisonment of refugees, said the centre was being built on the island in an effort to avoid public scrutiny from mainland Australians. \"It's a long way from the mainland where the lawyers and trouble-makers are,\" he said. \"We'll be kept away from it.\"\nA resident of eight years, two as shire president, Mr Thompson said he did not trust the federal Government because it ignored the concerns of the 1500-strong community. \"There's a sense the Commonwealth will do what it wants,\" he said. \"You've got to be a little suspicious of a government that lets its own people be held in Guantanamo Bay, like David Hicks. People here have that feeling that when something big is being built away from the media - it's not fishy, it's smelly.\"\nMr Thomson said the Shire council were not notified when the current Christmas Island detention centre reopened last week to detain seven West Timorese asylum seekers.\nAzmi Yon, president of the island's Malay association, has lived for 37 years on the island and wants the federal Government to leave it alone. He said locals were confused and did not know if the new centre would just be used for refugees or as a Guantanamo-style prison. \"We need something from them in black and white to say what it is,\" he said. \"Tell us something, don't keep us in the dark.\" \nMr Yon said the island was home to a harmonious group of Chinese, Malays and Europeans who respected each other's cultures. \"Why disturb an isolated and unique environment when you can (build the centre) somewhere else?\" he said.\nMothballed Detention Centre Reopened\nA group of seven asylum seekers were transported by DIMIA to Christmas Island last week. One detainee, his wife and infant children have been allowed to live in the community under new detainment laws. However, three other asylum seekers remain the sole inhabitants of the current Christmas Island detention centre - reopened for the seven from Indonesian West Timor on November 17. \nRefugee advocates, Democrats and Greens senators said the recent West Timorese asylum seekers had been \"shunted\" to the remote facility at a massive cost, raising more doubts about the Howard Government's promise not to detain children.\nDemocrats senator Andrew Bartlett, who visited a previous group of 52 Vietnamese asylum seekers in December last year, said he was especially alarmed to learn that children were still being detained despite the Government's promise that children would only be detained as a last resort.\n\"We want to know exactly what the cost has been to unnecessarily fly these people over to Christmas Island and why, seeing that they managed to arrive within the accepted migration zone and should be processed here,\" Senator Bartlett said. \"The only possible reason this family has been transferred to such a remote location is the very deliberate intention of the Government to deny these people proper processing of their claims and to prevent them from accessing adequate legal and other support. It is also assists the Government to keep the family away from media attention or public scrutiny.\"\nAustralian Greens Senator Kerry Nettle says the Government should suspend the construction of the Christmas Island detention centre and review the necessity of the facility. \"At a time when the Government claims to be reforming its immigration detention system, it is increasing its capacity to lock people up,\" Senator Nettle said. \"After the recent scandals and abuses, the public want alternatives to detention, but the Government insists on building more empty prisons.\"\nAccording to Immigration Department figures provided at the November 2005 Senate Estimates:\n\"* The current immigration detention centres - Baxter, Villawood, Maribyrnong, Perth, Port Augusta and the existing Christmas Island facility, already have a capacity to hold 1,688 people and they have contingency places for 667 more people, bringing the total capacity to 2,355. \"\n\"*Port Hedland has a capacity to hold 820 people and is costing $3 million a year to be ready to reopen. \"\n\"*The infamous Woomera Detention Centre holds 800 and costs $2.6 million to keep mothballed.\"\nSenator Nettle said: \"Australia's total immigration detention capacity is already 3,975 people. The locals on Christmas Island are opposed to this facility, yet the Government is wasting $210 million on another empty prison. Is the government planning to increase the number of people in detention and deport people from the mainland to Christmas Island?\" \nEnvironmental Concerns\nThere has also been environmental concerns about the development. The detention centre site is adjacent to prime \"Abbotts booby\" habitat, in the north-west corner of the island, and is surrounded by the Christmas Island National Park. \nEndangered Abbott's Boobies nest in tall rainforest trees immediately to the north, south and south-east of the site, and their proximity puts the species at the mercy of turbulence generated by the passage of wind across the clearing.\nThe National Park encloses the entire range of at least 35 endemic species, more than any other Australian protected area. It is part of the network of habitats of migratory species that Australia must protect under international agreements such as the Japan-Australia Migratory Bird Agreement (JAMBA) and the China-Australia Migratory Bird Agreement (CAMBA).\nThe Wilderness Society have said, \"There are several serious environmental concerns with the selection of this site, not least of which was the selection process itself, the Howard government's self-exemption from environmental scrutiny normally required under the EPBC Act, and its commitment to \"best practice\" environmental measures during construction of the detention centre.\"\nResearch has shown that Abbott's Boobies nesting within 300 m of clearings experience significantly lower breeding success than birds nesting further away. At last count, 36% of breeding sites across the island were located within this 300 m danger zone.\nThe centre, under construction since January this year, is not due to be operational until late 2006."}

The apparent slip occurred during a talk Graham was giving at a San Antonio conference on Oct. 31. The disclosure of the number, reported in the Nov. 14th issue of \"U.S. News and World Report\", marked the first time the figure has been revealed since 1998, when the figure was almost half its current figure, at $26.7 billion.\nSteven Aftergood, the director of the Project on Government Secrecy at the Federation of American Scientists and a secrecy expert, and his group have led efforts to sue for the disclosure of the budget on four different occasions. He relayed in an interview that this is only the third time since 1947 (the year of the CIA's inception) that the intelligence community has revealed its spending. In 1997, George Tenet, then the director of the CIA, compelled by the lawsuit brought by Aftergood's group under the Freedom of Information Act, made public that year's budget: $26.6 billion. The budget was again revealed in the following year, but in 1999, Tenet reversed the policy, and budgets have since remained classified with support from the courts. \nCurrently, the Senate has signed off on a provision presented by Frank Lautenberg (D-NJ) that would strip the security clearances of any government official, including those in Congress and on House and Senate staffs, who intentionally discloses national security secrets. A request for a roll call vote was avoided when senators Lautenberg and John Warner (R-VA) compromised, and instead, an unusual parliamentary procedure called a \"standing division\" was implemented to approve the addition of the provision to the defense bill. Senator Lautenberg could still have requested the \"yeas and nays\" -- a roll call vote. In this procedure, senators in the chamber at the time rise to denote approval. The Associated Press reports that Democrats accused the Republican refusal of a roll call vote to be a reflection that they did not want to go on record in favor of the provision, while the Republicans blamed time constraints and said that they did not want to inconvenience senators preparing to leave town for Veterans' Day."}

Bangladesh police have arrested six men, including a suicide squad member in different parts of the country, in the last two days.\n\"This is the first suicide attack in Bangladesh,\" stated Abdul Kaiyum, national police chief, after blasts in the south-eastern port cities of and , located near the capital .\n\"These were powerful homemade bombs. It seems Jamayetul Mujahideen have stepped up their attacks after we arrested many of their members.\" \nAccording to Chittagong officials, a pair of set off explosives at a police checkpoint outside the main court around 9 a.m. Two police officers and at least one of the bombers were killed in the attack.\nMinutes later, a bomb exploded inside a court in the city of Gazipur, about 20 miles north of the capital, Dhaka. Three people were killed and many more injured, including lawyers and court staff. Various reports assume the explosion was the work of a suicide bomber. \nThe attacks came two days after security was tightened around embassies in Dhaka following a faxed message in the name of Al Qaeda in South Asia. The message also threatened to blow up the U.S. and British missions, as well as other European embassies. \n\"Jamayetul Mujahideen is using Islam's name to kill people. The government has taken a hard stand and will now take an even harder stand,\" said Prime Minister Khaleda Zia during a visit to the south.\nAccording to Majedul Huq, Chittagong police commissioner, the blasts appeared to be the work of suicide bombers, who had explosives strapped to their bodies or hidden in bags. \n\"The bombers apparently turned more violent as we set up checkposts trying to reinforce security at court premises,\" Huq said.\nA wave of bombings has rattled Bangladesh in recent months after fundamentalist groups led by Afghan war veterans launched a campaign for Islamic rule based on the Shariat. The militants have often targeted lawyers. On Aug. 17, there were nearly 400 simultaneous bombings across the country. Jamayetul Mujahideen, led by Afghan war veteran Shaikh Abdur Rahman, has been held responsible for the attacks. In October, militants attacked courts in three districts.\nOn Nov. 14, two judges were killed when bombs were thrown at their car, and in later weeks other lawyers and judges have received threats. The \"Daily Star\" reported that Jamayetul Mujahideen has threatened to kill three judges and blow up Mymensingh Press Club.\nPolice say a 2,000-strong \"suicide squad\" has been formed from members of Jamayetul Mujahideen and two other banned groups, Jagrata Muslim Janata Bangladesh and Harkatul Jihad.\nBangladesh is the world's third-most-populous Muslim country after Indonesia and Pakistan."}

EU Justice Commissioner Franco Frattini said the consequences would be \"extremely serious\" if reports of such jails turned out to be true. \nAccording to Human Rights Watch, the secret prisons are located in Poland and Romania. This comes amid an EU investigation into claims that the US ran clandestine jails in eastern Europe. In the case of Romania, a senior Euro MP has questioned whether its accession to the EU should go ahead as planned. The US has declined to confirm or deny the reports of secret jails, which became public in the US earlier this month. \nSpeaking at a news conference in Berlin, Mr Frattini called for tough penalties against any involved state, saying \"I would be obliged to propose to the Council of EU Ministers serious consequences, including the suspension of voting rights in the council.\" He said a suspension of voting rights would be justified if any country is found to have breached the bloc's founding principles of human rights, democracy and the rule of law. Such a move would be unprecedented for the EU.\nHowever, a diplomatic source said that to suspend a member state's voting rights in the Council of the European Union, the other 24 member states would have to vote unanimously to take such a step, which would be unlikely to happen in practice. \nMr Frattini said the Bush administration had asked for more time to deliver a response to the accusations after a senior commission official formally raised the issue on a visit to Washington last week. \"Right now, there is no [US] response,\" he said. The allegations that the CIA held al-Qaeda suspects in secret prisons in Eastern Europe were first reported in the Washington Post on November 2, but the newspaper withheld information on the location of the prisons on the request of the U.S. government.\nDuring his first U.S. visit, the newly appointed German foreign minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier failed to receive any clarification on the question of secret CIA prisons, but the United States has now officially recognized that this is an issue of great concern to its European allies.

Along with A.L.I.C.E.'s chief programmer Dr. Richard S. Wallace, two other Loebner prize winners, Robby Garner and this year's winner, Rollo Carpenter, also gave presentations, as did other finalists.\nThe University of Surrey venue was chosen, according to Dr. Wallace, not only because it was outside the U.S. (A.L.I.C.E.'s birthday fell on the weekend holiday there, so he expected few people would attend a conference in America), but also because of its recently erected statue of Alan Turing, who posed the famous A. I. experiment which inspired much of the work on bots like A.L.I.C.E. University of Surrey Digital World Research Centre organizers Lynn and David Hamill were pleased to host the event because it encourages multi-disciplinary interaction, and because of the Centre's interest in interaction between humans and computers.\nDr. Wallace gave a keynote address outlining the history of A.L.I.C.E. and . Many people commented on the fact the he seemed to have moved around a lot in the last ten years, having lived in New York, Pennsylvania, San Francisco, Maine, Amsterdam and Philadelphia, while working on the Alicebot project. The A.L.I.C.E. and AIML software is popular among chat robot enthusiats primarily because of its distribution under the GNU free software license. One of Dr. Wallace's PowerPoint slides asked the question, \"How do you make money from free software?\" His answer: memberships, subscriptions, books, directories, syndicated ads, consulting, teaching, and something called the Superbot.\nRollo Carpenter gave a fascinating presentation on his learning bot Jabberwacky, reading from several sample conversations wherein the bot seemed amazingly humanlike. Unlike the free A.L.I.C.E. software, Carpenter uses a proprietary learning approach so that the bot actually mimics the personality of each individual chatter. The more people who chat with Jabberwacky, the better it becomes at this kind of mimicry. \nIn another interesting presentation, Dr. Hamill related present-day research on chat robots to earlier work on dialog analysis in telephone conversations. Phone calls have many similarities to the one-on-one chats that bots encounter on the web and in IM. Dr. Hamill also related our social expectations of bots to social class structure and how servants were expected to behave in Victorian England. He cited the famous Microsoft paperclip as the most egregius example of a bot that violated all the rules of a good servant's behavior.\nBots have advanced a long way since philanthropist Hugh Loebner launched his controversial contest 15 years ago. His Turing Test contest, which offers an award of $100,000 for the first program to pass an \"audio-visual\" version of the game, also awards a bronze medal and $2000 every year for the \"most human computer\" according to a panel of judges. Huma Shah of the University of Westminster presented examples of bots used by large corporations to help sell furniture, provide the latest information about automotive products, and help customers open bank accounts. Several companies in the U.S. and Europe offer customized bot personalities for corporate web sites.\nEven though Turing's Test remains controversial, this group of enthusiastic developers seems determined to carry on the tradition and try to develop more and more human like chat bots.\nHugh Loebner is dedicated to carry on his contest for the rest of his life, in spite of his critics. He hopes that a large enough constituency of winners will exist to keep the competition going well beyond his own lifetime. Dr. Wallace says, \"Nobody has gotten rich from chat robots yet, but that doesn't stop people from trying. There is such a thing as 'bot fever'. For some people who meet a bot for the first time, it can pass the Turing Test for them, and they get very excited.\""}

Lingering doubt over Lovitt's guilt was a key factor in Warner's decision. Lovitt's sentence has now been reduced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole.\nThis is the first time Warner has granted clemency in his four years in office. All eleven previous clemency petitions have been denied. Warner chose this petition to be his first, and likely last, granted, noting that clemency should only be used in an \"exceptional circumstance. Among these are circumstances in which the normal and honored processes of our judicial system do not provide adequate relief - circumstances that, in fact, require executive intervention to reaffirm public confidence in our justice system\" .\nLovitt was sentenced to death in 1999 for the murder of a pool hall manager. His defense team, including former Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr, argued that DNA tests could have exonerated Lovitt, but weren't performed due to a mistake by a court clerk which resulted in key evidence being thrown away after the trial. \nDue to the commution of Lovitt's sentence, Kenneth Boyd, who is scheduled to be executed in North Carolina on Friday, will likely become the 1,000th person executed since 1976."}

The EU is holding strong on its agriculture position while keeping internal dissent in check.

The burden of adjustment is being placed on developing countries.\" \nThe IMF also released a policy discussion paper titled \"Africa in the Doha Round\".

Yang writes, \"African negotiators may have overlooked the potential market access gains in developing countries, where trade barriers remain relatively high and demand for African imports has expanded substantially.\" According to the paper Africa has primarily sought access of wealthiest nations including the US and the EU while limiting it's attention to China and other countries who imported 30 percent of Africa's exports.

The order would have temporarily halted construction of new grain storage tanks.\nDyer Grain's efforts at expansion have been blocked several times over the past few years both by zoning restrictions on the height of structures and by citizens groups who filed suit against the grain company and the city's board of zoning appeals. The lawsuit was dismissed two months ago. The Dyer City Council then amended the zoning ordinance to include \"grain storage tanks and bins\" in a section of the ordinance listing exclusions, such as free standing spires and towers, to the regular 40 foot height restriction on buildings.\nSeveral citizens spoke at the November 28 city council meeting to address alleged deficiencies in the building permit issued to Dyer Grain. The citizens claimed that according to the site plan filed with the application for the permit, the location of the tanks will violate another provision in the zoning ordinance restricting the height of all structures to the distance from surrounding property lines plus ten feet. The citizens were also concerned over a \"grain conveyor\" that will cross a city street. Mayor Jewell indicated that he would contact the Gibson County building inspector (who is contracted by the city to act as the municipal inspector) to research the citizens' concerns.\nJewell contacted Ricky Bailey, Gibson County Building inspector, on Wednesday. Bailey reportedly could find no deficiencies with the permit and, based on this advice, Jewell chose not to issue the stop work order himself. The City Council could still meet and vote to issue the order. The council meets the second Monday of each month.\n\"The main problem is that the grain company is in an industrial zone -- which is located smack in the middle of a low-density residential zone.\" Nathan Reed, an elected Alderman of Dyer said, \"The property values in the area have increased (with inflation) but not at the same rate as other properties.\"\nNormal buildings, such as offices and warehouses, can't exceed 40' plus 10' to the eave. The requested change in the ordinance changes the status of the towers from a building to the same status of an antenna or tower.\nMr Reed added, \"The height to the eave is 76', the height to the top of the tank is 105', the height to the top of the elevator (atop the tank) is 133'. The 133' is the only measurement that matters now because the change to the zoning ordinance means this is no longer a \"building\", but rather the same as an antenna or tower.\"\n\"The grain company specifically requested that change to the ordinace -- which was opposed by several citizens...They can build it as high as they like so long as it conforms to the overal height restriction for towers, spires, etc.\"\nMr Reed commented on additional concerns, \"The citizens are concerned about the health effects of (additional) grain dust, noise, and grain explosions.\"\nThe new construction is expected to generate annual property tax revenues of $10,000 to $16,000."}

It is more favourable to use skin from another person's face instead of skin from another part of the patient's body, as the texture and colour of the skin are more likely to match.\nA statement released by the hospital in Amiens said that the 38-year-old patient, who wishes to remain anonymous, has not been able to eat or speak properly since the attack in May this year. The woman was reportedly in \"excellent general health\" and her graft looked normal.\nEthical concerns, psychological impact, concerns relating to immunosuppression and consequences of technical failure have prevented teams from performing face transplant operations in the past, even though it has been technically possible to carry out such procedures for years.\nMr Hutchison warned of several problems with face transplants, such as blood vessels in the donated tissue clotting and immunosuppressants failing or increasing the patient's risk of cancer. He also pointed out ethical issues with the fact that the procedure requires a \"beating heart donor\". The transplant is carried out while the donor is brain dead, but still alive by use of a ventilator.\nAccording to Stephen Wigmore, chair of British Transplantation Society's ethics committee, it is unknown to what extent facial expressions will function in the long term. He said that it is not certain whether a patient could be left worse off in the case of a face transplant failing.\nMr Michael Earley, a member of the Royal College of Surgeon's facial transplantation working party, commented that if successful, the transplant would be \"a major breakthrough in facial reconstruction\" and \"a major step forward for the facially disfigured.\""}

The presidential speech followed from a newly released White House document titled the National Strategy for Victory in Iraq. White House Press Secretary Scott McCellen claimed that the strategy outlined is what the administration has been following since 2003, and said that the released document is simply an unclassified version of the same for the public to review.\nThis release follows growing public and congressional dissatisfaction over the continuing violence in Iraq, rising US and Iraqi death toll, revelations of corruption and misadministration in the reconstruction program and the administration's handling of the war. A day before the president's address, Sen. Hillary Clinton, in an E-mail to her supporters had said \"Given years of assurances that the war was nearly over and that the insurgents were in their 'last throes,' this administration was either not being honest with the American people or did not know what was going on in Iraq.\" \n\"As the Iraqi forces gain experience and the political process advances, we will be able to decrease our troop levels in Iraq without losing our capability to defeat the terrorists. These decisions about troop levels will be driven by the conditions on the ground in Iraq and the good judgment of our commanders,\" stated the President on Nov. 30 while speaking to Midshipmen at the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland.\nAs was expected, Bush did not set a timeframe for U.S. troop withdrawal, which is in direct opposition to recent calls for such a timetable by congressional leaders. The administration and its supporters label such a timeframe as \"artificial\". In his speech, Bush characterized those calling for a withdrawal deadline as \"sincere, but...sincerely wrong.\" and said \"Setting an artificial deadline to withdraw would vindicate the terrorists' tactics of beheadings and suicide bombings and mass murder -- and invite new attacks on America.\" \nBush admitted that there had been \"some setbacks in training Iraq\u2019s security forces,\" and that their performance is still \u201cuneven in some areas.\" Earlier, in a congressional briefing, General Casey, the top U.S. commander in Iraq, had said that so far only one Iraqi battalion out of 120 being trained was capable of mounting operations without support from U.S. forces. The strategy document released also stated that \"it's not realistic to expect a fully functioning democracy able to defeat its enemies three years after Saddam is finally removed from power,\" prompting questions about when the administration made such a determination. \nIn the White House press briefing Scott McClellan did not directly answer a question about which, if any of the short, medium and long term goals set out in the strategy has been achieved, saying that \"I want to say we've made real progress on all three fronts of the strategy for victory.\" Senate Majority leader Bill Frist (R-Tenn) echoed the same sentiment, saying \" ... examining the results on the ground, it's clear that we continue to make progress on the political, security and economic fronts\"\nSenator John Kerry (D-Mass), felt the President was ignoring what his own generals are telling him. \n\"The large presence of American forces on the ground feeds the insurgency,\" stated Kerry. \nDemocratic politicians generally dismissed the speech as a repeat of old rhetoric. \nHarry Reid (D-Nev), Senate minority leader, accused Bush of \"recycling his tired rhetoric of 'stay the course'.\" According to Reid, Bush had \"missed an opportunity to lay out a real strategy for success in Iraq that will bring our troops safely home.\"\nSteve Clemons, director of the American Strategy Programme at the New America Foundation, said Bush's war aims failed to address the strains on U.S. armed forces imposed by Iraq. \"It's a very expansive commitment and it blows by the structural questions,\" stated Clemons. He added that those problems could only be resolved by a withdrawal, changing the current rules limiting the frequency of combat tours for individual units, or by moving towards a draft. Clemons said Bush was trying to escape those problems by portraying Iraqi forces as more ready than they actually are. \nWashington spends more than $6b a month to keep its forces in Iraq. More than 2,100 Americans and many more thousands of Iraqis have been killed since the March 2003 invasion."}

While these stories are mostly factual, they present only one side of events and blend out parts that don't reflect favourably on U.S. or Iraqi governments. \nAccording to the report, the Pentagon hired the Lincoln Group, a Washington-based firm that translates the stories into Arabic and places them in Baghdad newspapers. When published, many of these articles are not marked as originating from the U.S. military, but presented as unbiased news reports, written by independent Iraqi journalists. The LA times quotes a senior military official, stating that \"Absolute truth was not an essential element of these stories.\"\nEarlier this year, the Bush administration came under criticism for distributing videos and news stories in the United States without identifying the federal government as its source, and paying American journalists to promote administration policies. The Government Accountability Office has characterized these practices as \"covert propaganda.\"\nU.S. law only prevents the military from planting propaganda through American news outlets. Critics charge, however, that in the modern media environment, stories written for foreign news sources are likely to leak into American news.\nThe response from the Pentagon was mixed, with Rumsfeld's spokesperson Bryan Whitman saying that he was unaware of such practice, noting that \"this article raises some question as to whether or not some of the practices that are described in there are consistent with the principles of this department.\" \nOn the other hand, Lt. Col. Barry Johnson, a military spokesman in Iraq, said \"This is a military program initiated with the Multi-National Force to help get factual information about ongoing operations into Iraqi news.\" \n\"An important part of countering misinformation in the news by insurgents,\" added Johnson.\n\"I want to emphasize that all information used for marketing these stories is completely factual.\"\nU.S. spokesperson Maj. Gen. Rick Lynch defended the practices.\n\"We do empower our operational commanders with the ability to inform the Iraqi public but everything we do is based on fact, not based on fiction,\" said Lynch.\nJohn Schulz, a former executive with Voice of America called the military program scary.\n\"The Bush administration, and some elements within the Defense Department do not seem to grasp the irony that, in their efforts to create, impose or inspire democratic society in Iraq, they are subverting the very core of what democracy means and are instead, by example, undercutting the very thing they are attempting to install in Iraq,\" said Schulz."}

Mr Gerard announced on Friday 2nd that he will resign from the Board, citing the events of this week as the reason.\nOn Tuesday, November 29, Wayne Swan, the Shadow Treasurer asked of Costello in the first question of Question Time about an apparent statement that Costello made to Gerard, namely, \"I know there's an issue with the Tax Office but I don't have a problem with you on the board\". Costello responded that he had no problem with Gerard, noting that \"he brings a great understanding of Australian manufacturing industry to the board\", and that the obligatory declaration of interest was \"indeed was signed by Mr Gerard\".\nLater it was said by Swan in the House of Representatives that Gerard's company was using \"tax havens as tax avoidance schemes to the value of $150 million\" and that the declaration of interest mentioned was only in regard to his personal affairs and on asking the Treasurer when he knew this, claimed that him actually knowing the information \"would breach the secrecy act\". Later Swan revealed that Gerard \"and his corporate vehicles\" have been \"susbtantial donors\" to the Liberal Party. Costello maintained that the Government \"[does] not think that supporting the Liberal Party is a disqualification from holding ministerial office, prime ministerial office, Treasury office or other offices in Australia\"\nSwan moved a censure motion to \"provide this House with a full and proper explanation of...his communications with Mr Robert Gerard...and his knowledge of Mr Robert Gerard's dispute with the Australian Taxation Office...\", which failed in the Government's favour with votes 83 to 59 in division.\nOn Wednesday, November 30, Swan opened the House in a movement to suspend standing orders again to get information from the Treasurer, stating that \"The Treasurer is in real strife\" before the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer moved the gag. In Question Time, the Opposition continued to ask every question in regard to the appointment of Gerard. The Leader of the Opposition Kim Beazley revealed in his question to the Treasurer that \"some of his cabinet colleagues have privately said that they did not consider Mr Gerard was 'a good choice' in the first place for the Reserve Bank board\". The Treasurer responded that Gerard's \"appointment was supported by all\nmembers of the cabinet\"\nIn the subsequent Matters of Public Importance debate, the matter selected was that proposed by Wayne Swan, namely, \"The need for the Treasurer to uphold the highest standards of probity in the selection of candidates for the Reserve Bank Board.\"\nOn Thursday, December 1, the Opposition again reserved a number of its questions for inquiring about Gerard's appointment. Swan revealed in a question to the Treasurer that Gerard Corporation had \"acquired an investment company in the tax haven of the British Virgin Islands eight months after the Treasurer recommended his appointment to the Reserve Bank board\". Costello responded to Swan referring him to \"a statement about that allegation in the \"Australian Financial Review\" today...in which he makes it clear that no income\nhas been derived.\"\nLater, the Leader of the Opposition tried to move a censure motion on the treasurer, but leave of the House was not granted, so he had to resort to moving a motion to suspend standing orders to move the same motion, to censure the Treasurer for his appointment. The motion failed due to Government numbers, but the Matters for Public Importance (which follows Question Time) which was selected as \"The need for the Government to govern for all Australians\nnot just a privileged few.\" in order to draw a comparison with the unequal treatment of the Treasurer in supporting Gerard and the new industrial relations legislation, dubbed WorkChoices, and said how the Treasurer and the Prime Minister were \"laughing up their sleeves\", that the Treasurer was \"not fit to lead\", and Gerard \"is the worst attendee on the Reserve Bank board.\" \nThe Minister for Workplace Relations, Kevin Andrews, however focused elsewhere on the MPI, and drew the attention of the Australian Labor Party's ties to the unions, had described the Opposition as a \"policy free zone\", said that \"there is one group that represents privilege in this place and that is the Australian Labor Party\", and stressed the benefits of WorkChoices.\nCraig Emerson noted that the Queensland branch of the Liberal Party participated in \"deliberate tax evasion\", and that Mr Gerard \"paid penalty tax in circumstances of deliberate tax evasion\". Emerson later said that the Liberal Party was \"soft on tax cheats\", \"soft on tax cheating Liberal Party donors...and members\".\nThe adjournment debate also brought up criticism of Gerard's appointment in the adjournment debate. Christopher Bowen noted the \"disquiet\" in the media, and noted the previous Board member Bernie Fraser also calling for his dismissal. Bernard Ripoll called for a \"full inquiry\" into the Government's \"self serving public policy\".\nSwan has said that Gerard had done the \"honourable thing\", but that he will not let up on pressing the Treasurer for a full disclosal of the facts.\nThe House of Representatives as of this date sits next on December 5, 2005."}

She also alleges that her sexuality caused the school to suspend her when there was no specific policy addressing displays of public affection in the student handbook, and that her privacy rights were violated when the school principal revealed to her parents that she was lesbian.\nThe school district sought to have the charges dismissed by arguing in part that Nguon was openly gay on campus, and therefore had no right to privacy on the matter.\nJudge James V. Selna of the Central District Court of California found that the school district was immune from the plaintiff\u2019s claims in a 13-page finding issued on Monday. However, the individual administrators, the school principal and superintendent, did not qualify for immunity.

Federal Environment Minister Ian Campbell says Australia is focused on measures that should be taken after Kyoto expires in 2012.\n\"We need to do something that suits the developed world, something that suits the rapidly developing world, partnerships, technologies, economic mechanisms that drive us towards that,\" said Campbell. \"We're nowhere near that at the moment and Australia wants to be a constructive part of driving us towards a very useful post-Kyoto regime.\"\nProtesters across Australia are using the International Day of Action on Climate Change to demand the government adopt a clean energy policy. Hundreds of people marched through Sydney on Saturday to mark the day. \nThe protest against global warming coincides with the 12-day conference in Montreal, which will discuss climate change measures and future international action when the Kyoto Protocol expires at the end of 2012. Australia and the United States are the only western industrialised nations which refuse to ratify the global Kyoto Protocol. Australia has delegates at the Montreal meeting, but will only act as observers.\nMelinda Cook said scientists had predicted huge negative consequences including extreme weather and even social and economic impacts if steps were not taken now. Cook also said governments must make a \"serious commitment\" not to build any more coal fire powered stations.\nThe United States Bush administration and the Australian Howard Government have refused to ratify the Kyoto agreement, which pledges industrialised nations to cut carbon dioxide levels to 5.2 per cent below 1990 levels between 2008 and 2012.\nGlobal Action\nUp to a million people will take to the streets of more than 100 cities across dozens of countries today to demand greater action on global warming. Organizers of the protests say the world's leading industrialised nations had failed to make an impact on climate change and some, in particular Britain, were backsliding on their environmental commitments.\nThe United Nations meeting in Montreal, will be attended by representatives of 189 countries. The centerpiece of the International Day of Climate Protest will be a mass protest in Montreal, where at least 15,000 people are expected to lobby delegates.\nAcross the planet, protests are being held in locations from Helsinki to Seoul.

Although the accord has to be ratified by East Timor's parliament which is ruled by Fretilin with 55 seats the biggest block in parliament, but all the smaller parties are said to be working together to veto the deal.\nIn 1975, Portugal abandoned East Timor and the people declared self-independence only to be invaded by Indonesia with out any intervention from Australia or the United States. Indonesia then agreed on no formal maritime boards but on a joint exploitation zone splitting profits 50/50. Indonesian rule in East Timor was marked by extreme violence and brutality and following a UN-sponsored agreement between Indonesia, Portugal and the US, East Timor held a referendum and gained independence, but violent Indonesian sponsored militia took hold. A peacekeeping force (INTERFET, led by Australia) then intervened putting a stop to the violence. The exploitation zone splitting profits was then changed to 60% in favour of Australia, but now a new deal has been proposed 90/10 in favour of Timor. In the mean time Australia has been accused of profiting by up to 2 billion dollars between the deals by activist groups like http://www.timorseajustice.org/ whose campaigning saw Woodside suspended oil pumping in the affected area. \nContemporary International law asserts that the area under dispute belongs to East Timor. Australia has withdrawn from the maritime division of the International Court of Justice, which could have settled this matter, instead opting to try to settle the matter without the court.\nThe previous deal has caused political infighting within East Timor about why such a smaller percentage was accepted.

Another man was put to death on Friday for the 1994 murder of a store clerk, becoming the 1,001st person executed in the United States since capital punishment was reinstated 28 years ago.\nThe milestone drew a wave of protesters to the Central Prison in Raleigh, N.C., who opposed capital punishment.\nKenneth Lee Boyd, 57, of Rockingham, N.C., died by lethal injection for the 1988 shootings of his estranged wife, Julie Curry Boyd, who was 36, and her father, Thomas Dillard Curry, 57. Members of both families had asked to be present for the execution.\nBoyd told Associated Press in a prison interview that he wanted no part of the infamous numerical distinction of being the 1000th prisoner executed. \"I'd hate to be remembered as that,\" Boyd said on Wednesday. \"I don't like the idea of being picked as a number.\" \nSome argued that Boyd, who had an I.Q. of 77, should not have been executed. The cutoff for mental retardation in some states, a mitigating factor in some capital cases, is an I.Q. of 75. Boyd never denied his guilt, but said he couldn't remember killing anyone and didn't know why he did it. \nBoyd's son, Kenneth Smith, 35, who visited his dad every day for the last two weeks, said in an interview on Thursday that he felt the attention paid to the milestone had hurt his father's chances for clemency. Smith also said his dad was deeply troubled that he might only be remembered as a grim hash mark in the history books. \"He didn't want to be 999, and he didn't want to be 1001 if you know what I mean,\" said Smith. \"He wanted to live.\"\nBelinda J. Foster, District Attorney for Rockingham, N.C., who prosecuted Boyd, said she felt confident that the death penalty was warranted in this case. \"There are cases that are so horrendous and the evidence so strong it just warrants a death sentence,\" Ms. Foster said. Michael Paranzino, president of the pro-death penalty group Throw Away the Key, agreed. \"You'll never stop crimes of passion, but I do believe the death penalty is a general deterrent, and it expresses society's outrage,\" Paranzino said.\n\"We believe this occasion is the perfect time to reconsider the whole issue of execution,\" said William F. Schulz, executive director of Amnesty International, a human rights group that has sought to end the practice of using executions as a punishment for crime around the world. \"Since 1976, about one in eight prisoners on death row in the U.S. has been exonerated. That should raise serious questions about ending a person's life,\" Schulz said.\nAccording to the non-governmental organization Amnesty International, the countries People's Republic of China, Iran and Vietnam are the only nations with more executions in 2004 than the United States. Thirty-eight of the 50 US states and the federal government permit capital punishment. An October 2005 Gallup poll found that 64 percent of all Americans support capital punishment in murder cases.\nNorth Carolina executed two prisoners last month, as well as two others earlier in the year.\nDebate over capital punishment\nThe grim milestone has prompted global outcry from human rights advocates. In a media statement the European Union also condemned the execution, calling for the end of the death penalty worldwide. \"We consider this punishment cruel and inhuman. It does not act as a deterrent and any miscarriage of justice - which is inevitable in any legal system - is irreversible.\" \"It is a scandal that the death penalty still exists in a civilised country like the United States of America,\" said Petra Herrmann, chairwoman of the German group Alive e V.\nBoyd's death rallied death penalty opponents, and about 150 protesters gathered outside the prison. After watching Boyd die, Rockingham County (N.C.) Sheriff Sam Page said the victims should be remembered. \"Tonight, justice has been served for Mr. Kenneth Boyd. What I would ask you to do is not forget the victims of this crime,\" Page said. \"Pray for them. Pray for them and their healing.\" \n\"This is one small step for humankind - backwards,\" said veteran American campaigner Clive Stafford Smith in an interview with Reuters. \"The death penalty makes us all far more barbaric. I have watched a lot of people die, and when you come out from watching someone being executed it certainly isn't a better world.\"\nAccording to Kenyan National Human Rights Commission Chairman Maina Kiai, \"[It is] a great pity that the US can keep on executing people [when much of the developed world had already ended the death penalty].\" \"Also, the fact that in the US a lot of death sentences that are carried out invariably affect people of colour and poor people, it's an issue of great concern,\" Kiai said.\nIn Singapore, where a 25-year-old Australian was hanged just hours before Boyd's execution, Sinapan Samydorai, president of the think-tank Think Centre, said there was no justice without life. \"The US is supposed to be a champion of human rights and democracy, yet they do not recognise the right to life,\" he said. Singapore has a mandatory death sentence for crimes such as murder, firearms offences and drug trafficking, and has hanged 420 people since 1991, mainly for drug trafficking. Singapore's death penalty is often believed to enjoy wide public support; although details remain obscure for political reasons.\nIn Japan, where the death penalty is also widely supported, Akiko Takada of anti-capital punishment group Forum 90 said despite frequent use of the death penalty in the United States, \"crime there shows no signs of diminishing, so ultimately the death of these people has no effect.\""}

It is understood that the company's agreement with the NSW Government will not provide Hardie directors and executives with the immunities from civil prosecution sought by the company. The possible charges for the members range as high as jail terms of up to five years. \nAccording to \"The Weekend Australian\", a source said, \"this arrangement suited ASIC because rather than channelling its efforts into cases that could provide compensation, it can concentrate on alleged offences that could result in criminal prosecution or banning officers from holding directorships or management positions.\" \nNSW Special Commissioner David Jackson QC said that former Hardie chief executive Peter Macdonald engaged in misleading or deceptive conduct when he told the stock exchange that the asbestos compensation trust Hardie set up in 2001 with $293 million would be \"fully funded\". At around the same time, James Hardie share holders voted for the relocation of its corporate base from Australia to the Netherlands.\nAnother alleged issue is a controversial $1.9 billion share cancellation, which a NSW MP said attracted ASIC to look at the activities of Hardie chairwoman Meredith Hellicar. \nThe ASIC task force plan to collect and analyse documents and interview witnesses into at least the middle of next year. Until then, any possible new charges are unlikely."}

This, along with speculation that the document was chiefly authored by a public opinion analyst recruited by the White House have led to some critics claiming that the drafted 'strategy' is targeting US public opinion, not the Iraqi insurgency.\nThe military, political and economic strategy for Iraq, outlined last week by President Bush in a speech at the Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland, was based by a 35-page document titled the \"National Strategy for Victory in Iraq\". A metadata tag on the document posted on the White House website identified its author as a computer user 'feaver_p'. It is believed to refer to Dr. Peter D. Feaver, a special advisor to the National Security Council staff.\nA political scientist at Duke University, Dr. Feaver analyzed public opinion polls about the Iraq war and attitudes towards war casualties. Dr. Feaver found that US public opinion will support military engagement abroad, despite growing casualties, provided that the public believed that the war was being fought for a worthy cause and that victory was achievable.\nDr. Feaver was one of the people who helped \"conceive and draft\" the document, according to a White House staffer, who said that Meghan L. O'Sullivan, the deputy national security adviser for Iraq and Afghanistan, and her staff played a larger role. White House officials confirmed to the \"New York Times\" that the document's \"creation and presentation strongly reflected the public opinion research\". \nThe document \"reflects the broad interagency effort under way in Iraq\" according to an NSC spokesman Frederick Jones and had received major contributions from the Departments of Defense, State, Treasury and Homeland Security, as well as the director of National Intelligence. \nOn Friday, Lt. Gen. Martin Dempsey, whose Multinational Security Transition Command is responsible for building Iraq's security forces, told reporters that he had seen the strategy document for the first time when it was released to the public. The White House had said that not all senior officers in Iraq had necessarily seen the document and Gen. Peter Pace, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, has said that he had read and critiqued the document on several occasions.\nEarlier, replying to questions about the President's strategy, White House press secretary Scott McClellan said that the document was an \"inter-agency document\" and an \"unclassified version\" of the administrations \"strategy for victory in Iraq\" published for the public to view. \nChristopher F. Gelpi, of Duke University, who co-authored Dr. Feaver's work titled \"Casualty Sensitivity and the War in Iraq,\" stated, \"The Pentagon doesn't need the president to give a speech and post a document on the White House Web site to know how to fight the insurgents. The document is clearly targeted at American public opinion.\" In their work together, Gelpi, Feaver and Reifler found that the most important factor which determines the US public's tolerance for US military deaths in a war is the public's \"beliefs about the likelihood of success,\" and a secondary, but still important, factor, was found to be the public's belief in the rightness of a war."}

With the help of the United States, Pakistani forces tracked down Rabia and killed him in a rocket attack near the Pakistani-Afghan border.\nRabia was among five people who were killed in the blast on Thursday in North Waziristan. According to official reports corroborated by Pakistani President General Pervez Musharraf, the blast was set off as the victims were making explosives inside a suspected al-Qaeda hideout. An anonymous senior intelligence officer said that a missile attack triggered a massive explosion in a stockpile of bomb-making materials, grenades and other munitions.\nHamza Rabia is a key associate of Ayman al-Zawahiri, a prominent figure in al-Qaeda. \"After Osama bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahri, Rabia was the most senior al Qaeda official for international terrorism planning,\" a US counteterrorism official said. According to officials, Rabia ranks somewhere between third and fifth in the organization's hierarchy. He is believed to have become the network's operational commander after the capture of Abu Farraj al-Libbi in Pakistan in May.\nIntelligence officials said that Rabia was the target of the attack due to his alleged involvement in terror attacks and killings of government officials. He was brought to Miran Shah, a strategic tribal region where remaining al-Qaeda members are believed to have been hiding, by al-Zawahri, who is believed to have been on the run along the border. Officials, however, say that they have no idea on the whereabouts of al-Zawahri or Osama bin Laden.\nBodies of Rabia and two other foreigners were retreived and buried by associates from outside Pakistan, according to Pakistan's English-language Dawn newspaper."}

The federal parliament has agreed to laws aimed at stifling home-grown terrorists. The terrorism legislation was rushed through the Senate yesterday evening after the Government gagged debate on the bill. \nThe new laws enable police and intelligence agencies to detain suspects without charge for up to 14 days in solitary confinement. Authorities can also restrict and control movements of suspects, including fitting them with electronic tags for up to 12 months. \nPrime Minister John Howard introduced the package after the July 2005 bombings in London. Federal Justice Minister Chris Ellison told the Senate the laws would give authorities the necessary tools to tackle terrorism, while being consistent with international human rights obligations.\nJohn North, president of the Law Council of Australia, an outspoken critic of the package, said lawyers would monitor the government's use of its new powers. \"We want governments to know that almost 50,000 lawyers will be watching closely to make sure the new laws are not implemented at the expense of our civil liberties,\" Mr North said. He also said in a letter addressed to Prime Minister John Howard that \"The legal profession believes that the ramifications of these laws have the potential to be as terrifying as terrorism itself.\" This following a media campaign launched by the Law Council in newspapers vilifying the new legislation as \"draconian\".\nThe package, broadly supported by the opposition Labor Party, gives police tougher powers to stop, search and seize evidence from suspects and enables more close circuit television cameras to be used to monitor public places. The new legislation also updates and allow greater use of security cameras.\nThe Australian Greens, the Democrats and the Law Council accuse the Labor Party of selling out civil rights by supporting the bill, which will give unprecedented powers to police and spy agencies. Australian Greens leader Bob Brown condemned the laws. \"We are in a new period of McCarthyism and we need to know that, and understand it, and worry that this time it won't be turned around, that citizens, using a law like this, will be brought before courts for political reasons, not security reasons,\" he told parliament.\nFollowing some amendments, the Commonwealth Ombudsman will be given more power to oversee detention, detainees will have greater access to relatives and police will need to satisfy a greater number of grounds to impose limits on who a suspect can contact. The Australian Law Reform Commission will review the sedition provisions next year.\nCivil libertarians and people who oppose Australia's involvement in Iraq also have protested. The proposed laws are \"horrific for journalists,\" senior Fairfax journalist David Marr said. \"Firstly, there's a completely secret new regime of putting people in preventive detention \u2014 that's entirely secret,\" he said. \"If we report it, if we report that people have gone into preventive detention, we're going to go individually to jail for five to seven years, something like that. Even if we report what happened to people in detention, we go to jail. \"\nAustralian Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission president John Von Doussa says the proposed counter-terrorism laws are the first step towards a police state. The legislation gives police extraordinary powers to detain people without charge, but does not set out means by which the application of those powers can be checked or appealed, he said. \nPrime Minister John Howard rejects suggestions the Government acted in undue haste by pushing a range of striking new laws through parliament before Christmas, despite public outcry over inadequate scrutiny and the gagging of parliamentary debate on many of the bills. \nDefence Minister, Senator Robert Hill says the government has a responsibility to protect Australians. \"Out of the British bombing, we went back and looked at our laws. We believed that we needed further powers to protect Australians, said Mr Hill. \"Obviously, we want to put them through as quickly as possible because we are addressing a terrorist threat.\""}

Their findings show the hormone can stop the immune system from functioning properly. \n\"Neuropeptide Y is one of those hormones that gets unregulated or released from neurones when stressful situations occur...it's known for example that it regulates blood pressure and heart rates so your heart rate goes up but it hasn't been known that it actually can affect immune cells as well,\" said Professor Herbert Herzog, one of the researchers.\nHerzog feels it is good to finally have proof of something people have suspected for so long. \n\"Now we have proven without doubt that there is a direct link and that stress can weaken the immune system and that makes you more vulnerable when you for example have a cold or flu and even in the more serious situations such as cancer can be enhanced in these situations,\" said Herzog.\nThe Garvan Institute study centres on two key events that enable the human body to recognise foreign substances and control invaders. When our body encounters a pathogen (bacteria and viruses), the immune cells retain and interrogate suspects. Their activation is made possible by NPY. These cells then return to the lymph nodes, which are found all over the body, with information about the foreign invaders. The lymph nodes are where decisions about defence are made.\n\"Most of us expect to come down with a cold or other illness when we are under pressure, but until now we have mostly had circumstantial evidence for a link between the brain and the immune system,\" said lead Garvan researcher, associate Professor Fabienne Mackay. \"During periods of stress, nerves release a lot of NPY and it gets into the bloodstream, where it directly impacts on the cells in the immune system that look out for and destroy pathogens (bacteria and viruses) in the body.\"\nIn the case of bacteria and viruses, TH1 cells are part of the attack team that is sent out on the \u2018search and destroy' mission. But when their job is done they need to be turned \u2018off' and the immune system reset. The same hormone, NPY, that activates the sentry cells now prompts the TH1 cells to slow down and die.\n\"Under normal conditions, circulating immune cells produce small amounts of NPY, which enables the immune cells on sentry duty and the TH1 immune cells to operate - it's a yin and yang kind of situation. But too much NPY means that the TH1 attack is prevented despite the foreign invaders being identified - and this is what happens during stress,\u201d added McKay.\nThe impact of stress on the body has been observed in athletes. Ph. D researcher at the , , together with the Australian Institute of Sport, studied elite and recreational athletes over five months.\nThey found elite athletes were more susceptible to respiratory diseases under stress. \n\"A lot of elite athletes put themselves through vast amounts of physical stress in their training, but also their emotional, psychological stress of feeling the pressure of Australia on their shoulders, wanting to compete and wanting to do their best,\" said Spence.\nIt's not just athletes who are prone to stress. Pressures at work and at home may cause emotional and mental stress that can be equally damaging. Almost a third of all work absenteeism in Australia is due to illness, costing employers over 10 billion a year.\n\"I think it has a huge impact for the work force and also for employers - if their employees are constantly stressed, constantly under pressure, they are more likely to get sick,\" Spence said.\nFurther research could lead to the development of new drugs which may inhibit the action of the neuropeptide Y hormone. \nHerzog warns people to minimise stress \"before\" it becomes a problem. \n\"Relaxation methods like yoga will help you to prevent that but there will still be people out there that are not responding to that and treatment by interfering with the system will be important,\" he said. \"There's obviously some time until such a treatment will be available but this is something we will definitely work towards.\"\nThe Garvan research will be published in the \"\", Volume 202, No. 11."}

Mr Zhang and five other Chinese asylum seekers began the strike in protest at Australia's Mandatory Detention policy. Five of the six hunger strikers ended their protest in November.\nThe Department of Immigration (DIMIA) says Mr Zhang is continuing his hunger strike after being hospitalised a fortnight ago. Now back in Villawood he is being closely monitored. A DIMMIA spokesperson said Mr Zhang was being urged to end his strike. The government continues to resist Mr Zhang's protest. \"As the minister said, his actions will not influence his migration status or outcomes,\" said the spokesperson.\nVictorian Greens refugees spokesman, Peter Job, has been speaking to Mr Zhang, and said the asylum seeker is determined to continue to strike despite his ailing health. Mr Job said Mr Zhang believes he was denied a fair hearing from the Immigration Department and the Refugee Review Tribunal, but was taking political action for all detained asylum seekers.\n\"He felt he had no option but to fight in the only way he could, with his body,\" said Mr Job. \"But above all, he spoke of his dread of long-term detention, telling of waking continually in the morning with a sense of profound despair and foreboding due to his incarceration, and telling me he feared the mental health damage he had seen in so many long-term detainees,\" he said.\nMr Job says he has tried to convince Mr Zhang to stop the hunger strike, but says he is in a desperate state. \"He is very upset, he feels that he will be in great danger if he returns to China,\" Mr Job said. \"He said he'd rather die here in Australia than go back to China, where he's convinced he'll be persecuted.\nRefugee Action Coalition (RAC) spokesman Ian Rintoul said the Immigration Department has been riddled with problems and too often rejected long-term detainees who are genuine refugees.\n\"The government itself has recognised there have been many mistakes in the department's processes, there have been many problems with the way asylum seekers have been dealt with,\" Mr Rintoul said. \"That's why we're desperately trying to urge the government to intervene in this particular case.\"\nImmigration Minister Amanda Vanstone said in mid November that the Government has done all it can for the Chinese asylum seeker. \"I don't support this kind of protest, I don't think anyone does, I recognise the risk it can play for the protesters themselves,\" she said. \"I've written to them urging them to get off their protest and making it clear to them that the Government doesn't consider cases while people are engaging in this sort of potentially very harmful protest.\"\nAnother Villawood detainee, Motahar Hussein, says Mr Zheng's health has drastically deteriorated and suspects that vital organs have experienced permanent damage. \n\"Though DIMIA continuously attempts to devise creative ways of crushing Mr. Jun Wen Zhang's spirit, he will not be easily intimidated,\" said Mr Hussein in a media release. \"He is willing and determined to continue with his peaceful and civilised protest. He believes he has no other option. He finds himself compelled to do so by the Howard Government's policy of inhumane and indefinite detention.

According to Air Marshal Service spokesman Dave Adams, the passenger did so, but then reached for a bag, at which point a marshal fired two or three shots and killed the passenger.

The \"Higher Education Support Amendment (Abolition of Compulsory Up-Front Student Union Fees) Bill 2005\", commonly known as \"voluntary student unionism\" or VSU, will have the effect of removing the automatic joining of university students into their respective unions, and the consequent abolition of the payment of union fees. These fees go towards amenities and services provided the student unions. The Federal Australian Labor Party Opposition, which had originally opposed the introduction of VSU, changed its policy which originally supported automatic unionism of students and compulsory fees, to a stance supporting only retainment of amenity and services fees.\nThe bill was read a second time on December 6, with Opposition members such as Brendan O'Connor highlighting the perceived Government ideological reasons for the pursuit of this bill, stating that the minister \"wants to be seen as an ideological warrior\", and also explains the reason for the Opposition's shift in policy -- that \"it takes the student political dimension, which seems to be the obsession of the government, out of the equation, and focuses on the services\". One Government member, Peter Lindsay, had noted in response to this, stating that when VSU was introduced in Western Australia \"the world did not end, the services continued to be provided...In fact, more services were provided because the student associiations had to be responsive to the needs of the students so they could get students, of their own free will, to decide to pay a student association fee\". \nA heated exchange followed between the next speaker Kelvin Thomson, Lindsay, and the deputy Speaker Robert Baldwin, over a comment \"Why should students have to pay for outsiders to use a sporting facility? Why? The member for Wills [Kelvin Thomson] cannot explain that.\" which Thompson said \"provoked\" him. Thomson's speech further criticised Brendan Nelson's proposal for a \"campus-by-campus ballot\", noting \"the great deal of opposition everywhere it has been put\", the \"Financial Review\" description as a plan which \"pleases no-one\". Alby Schultz, from the Government, had remarked on the \"Senate Employment, Workplace Relations and Education Committee inquiry suggested that...some student unions were badly run and gave poor service to the majority of students\", and that the money gathered from students \"sell[ed] a political agenda which many of the students-and I would say the majority of students-would not subscribe to personally or ideologically\", citing examples of the National Union of Students support for the Baxter detention center protest earlier this year. \nFurther Government and Opposition members continued the debate until 9 pm in the evening of December 6, where debate was adjourned for the day. \nOn December 7 the Leader of the House Tony Abbott moved a guillotine on this debate, where either at 12 noon or at the conclusion of the second reading debate, whichever comes first, the question should be put, and one hour be allotted for consideration in detail and conclusion of other stages of the bill. Deputy Leader of the Opposition Jenny Macklin in response called the movement of the bill \"unadulterated ideology...from this power-drunk government\". In the second reading debate, Brendan Nelson provided summary remarks after the two preceding speakers, stating that \"that students should be free to choose what services they will purchase with their money and what organisations they will join\", and that the compulsory payment \"is a flat tax. The students from the poorest families pay exactly the same as those from the wealthiest, and we think that this is one of the few anachronisms which remain to be addressed\". \nIn the consideration in detail stage, an amendment proposed by the independent Tony Windsor aimed to confine the use of fees for academic and recreational purposes only, which failed as there were fewer than five in support for the amendment. Opposition amendments were moved by Macklin after that to achieve the Oppositions views on VSU, but a Government member Sophie Panopoulos termed the amendments \"a fraud\" and \"taxation without representation\". The Opposition amendments failed due to Government numbers.\nThe bill subsequently passed the House of Representatives 78 to 58, and the Senate December 7 received the bill on the same day, and due to standing orders, will be debated at the next period of sittings, which will be early next year."}

The party is angry that amendments they proposed were not considered when the bill was passed. says the legislation is not strong enough. \n\"In the bill, there were some provisions to supposedly keep out international waste,\" she said. \"We don't think they go far enough and that they are open to manipulation and interpretation. So what we were trying to do is absolutely positively ensure that international waste will not be brought into this facility.\"\nThe NT Environment Centre's Gary Scott has hinted at civil disobedience similar to that seen during the anti-uranium mining protests at . \"I don't think Territorians are going to take this lying down unless that is in front of bulldozers,\" Mr Scott said.\nThe Centre\u2019s Peter Robertson has emphasised the importance of the waste dump for the federal government to realise its plans for a second nuclear reactor. \"If we get the dump, Sydney gets the reactor\". Establishing a national waste dump is a precondition for the operating license for the proposed which will replace in Sydney.\nRobertson pointed out that the issue of waste is creating an international crisis for the nuclear industry, with no storage plans for the more than 250,000 tonnes of high-level radioactive waste currently in existence. \nA detailed study of three Defence sites - Fishers Ridge, 43 km south-east of , Harts Range, 100 km north-east of , and Mount Everard, 27 km north-west of Alice Springs - will be conducted next year, with the facility to be operational by 2011.\nTraditional owners of Athenge Alhere - an estate group of the Arrernte Nation - have voiced their dissent to the nuclear dump and say they don\u2019t want waste from Sydney's Lucas Heights nuclear reactor brought to their land. \"Because the land we take care of, because all our ancestors lived in this land and hunted on this land as well, so it's mainly because of the animals and the next generation of our kids and their children, so we still say no,\" traditional owner Benedict Stevens said.\nCoalition MPs, including Northern Territory senator Nigel Scullion, secured a number of amendments to the bill. They included the ability of the NT government and indigenous land councils to decide on other site options, a prohibition on the storage of high level and overseas waste and the free storage of the NT's own waste.\nThe South Australian Government says tenacity staved off a nuclear dump on its land. SA Environment Minister, John Hill, says there could be a federal election before the facility's finally built. \"It will take them some time to construct this facility and that gives you some opportunities,\" he said. \nMr Hill says waste should be stored closer to in Sydney where it is generated. Radioactive waste is currently stored at over 100 locations across the country, including in hospital basements in major capital cities and at universities.\nUpdate: NT farmers have threatened to take action if a site near their farms is selected for the dump. Fishers Ridge, south of Katherine, is one of three Commonwealth sites earmarked for the facility. Sharon Shaw's farm 12 kilometres from the Fishers Ridge site. \"The thing that worries us the most, it's on top of a Tindal Aquifer which really concerns us in the fact that there's many sink holes that turn up every wet as the ground is always shifting,\" she said. \"Any normal person without an environmental degree or anything would realise that this ground is unstable.\""}

A Spotsylvania County committee, called the \"Dangerous Dog Task Force\", hammered out the basics of the bill that county Senator R. Edward Houck will introduce to the General Assembly in January.\nWithin the bill:\nThe dog would be legally defined as dangerous if it has bitten or attacked a person or companion animal. In the case of an attack on a companion animal, the injuries to the animal are such that it had to be euthanized. Currently, the Virginia state penal code contains no guidelines in the case of injury or death due to a dog attack.\n\"We're not talking about a little situation where somebody's pet chases a kid down the street with a bike and maybe jumps up and causes a very slight little scratch or a little nick or something,\" Senator Houck said Tuesday. \"We're talking about where people are seriously disfigured and maimed.\n\"This journey has just begun, this is going to be a long way,\" Senator Houck cautioned, since the proposals before the General Assembly could face many changes, or outright rejection.\nTask force committee member Maureen Hill-Hauch said to the issue of dog owners being held accountable for their animal\u2019s actions, \"This will send a clear and convincing message to irresponsible dog owners.\"\nThe legislation, called the Dorothy Sullivan Memorial Bill, is named in memory of the 82-year-old Spotsylvania woman who was mauled to death by 3 neighborhood Pit Bulls while she was walking her own dog in her front yard.

The voluntary student unionism bills aim to stop the compulsory joining of university students into the student union and the consequential abolition of payment of the union fees, which sometimes go to certain amenities and services provided to university students. Many students, associations, and vice-chancellors of universities are opposed to the legislation, with rallies and days of action taking place earlier this year. In the process, Senator Steve Fielding of the Family First Party held the key vote who expressed his late decision to support the passage of the VSU legislation.\nThe VSU legislation was earlier anticipated to be debated at the next session -- that is, next year -- but appeared on the notice paper today in case the Senate had time to discuss the bill, however, at approximately 1.40pm an urgency motion was moved on a number of bills, including the voluntary student unionism (VSU) legislation which entered the Senate yesterday. The urgency motion allots time on the second reading to extend to 4.30pm and remaining stages of the bill to 5.00pm. The Senate was to adjourn at 3.30pm, but this was extended to approximately 5.15-5.30pm. \nControversy.\nThe guillotine was controversial and criticised by non-Government senators, who drew on the perceived three and a half hour \"filibuster\" from Government members over non-controversial bills earlier today, where all parties were in agreement, and over perceived trivial bills such as a bill on the European Bank in Mongolia. Earlier Senator Penny Wong of the Australian Labor Party suggested that back-room dealings were taking place to get key Australian National Party senator Barnaby Joyce on-side. Senator Joyce had expressed concerns over the VSU bills contrary to the Nationals' support on the bill, and had proposed to amend the bill. The other key senator Steve Fielding has expressed that he has said that an amenities fee is appropriate if set \"at the right level\". Senator Hill has \"made no apology\" about putting forward the Government program, and said that he would \"do his best to implement the Government program\".\nLater.\nA division on the urgency motion followed, which was passed from Government Senate majority. \nIn the second reading, Senator Wong had said that the Government had treated the Senate chamber like \"an extension of their own party room\", and that the Government were \"drunk on power\". She went on to speculate whether the Nationals had \"rolled over\" in regards to Senator Joyce, or whether the Australian Liberal Party (the other counterpart in the Liberal/National Government coalition) had done a deal with Senator Fielding, and drew attention to the potential effects of abolishing the fees. Senator Natasha Stott-Despoja from the Australian Democrats has expressed her opposition to the bill and the policy, terming the day \"Freaky Friday\" and went on to say \"Democracy, in this place, is dead\" due to the earlier events of the day, as non-Government senators did not know about possible deals that were made or the details of the amendment.\nGovernment.\nSenator Ron Boswell, leader of the Nationals, expressed his support of the abolition of the fees, and the procurement of a package of funding of 80 million dollars towards funding academic and non-union related services, which he said satisfied the National's policy stance on the issue, and warned implicitly against crossing the floor. Family First Senator Fielding has said that the argument can \"run both ways\" in his speech, and said he had a \"great deal of trouble\" making up his mind on the issue, but said that Family First will be voting for the bill. Senator Kerry Nettle, the next speaker, was incensed at this, and termed Senator Fielding \"Senator Sellout\" but was asked to withdraw that remark. She went on to state amongst her remarks that Fielding has \"sold out\" students.\nJoyce.\nSenator Joyce, the final speaker, has expressed his opposition to compulsory unionism, and has said he will put his amendment to abolish compulsory unionism but described his amendment which will ensure alternative funding for services (but not described whether it will be compulsory fees) at parity with funding received today. Some senators who wished to speak but could not due to time constraints had their speeches incorporated into \"Hansard\" by leave.\nCommittee.\nIn committee, Senator Eric Abetz has stated the Government will be opposing the amendments proposed by Senator Wong, stating it \"erodes the principle\" of the legislation, saying it is \"taxation without representation\". Senator Wong responded by saying that Abetz \"didn't have the bottle\" to speak to the amendments, and noted the lack of details in the funding package proposed by Senator Boswell. Senator Bob Brown of the Australian Greens drew attention to Senator Fielding's stance, calling him a \"failure\" in regards to his Victorian state, criticising his position on the bill and his absence from the chamber, and praised Senator Joyce's commitment to his earlier word. Senator Stott-Despoja stated her support for the ALP amendments, but these failed due to Government numbers.\nSenator Joyce's amendments were then put (as the time cutoff passed) which led to a division, and in the division he crossed the floor on the amendments, which the Opposition supported. Senator Joyce's amendments however were defeated 29 to 31 -- Fielding's choice was key in this vote. Senator Joyce however voted with the Government to have the bills stand as printed.\nVotes.\nOn the third reading, which support signifies final passage of the bill, the vote was 29 to 27, so the legislation did pass. Joyce crossed the floor again on this stage. The bill must re-enter the House of Representatives again for concurrence, which had already risen the day earlier, and sits again February 2006, next year. "}

Speaking at a news conference on the summit sidelines, Ahmadinejad said most Jews in Israel \"have no roots in Palestine, but they are holding the destiny of Palestine in their hands and allow themselves to kill the Palestinian people.\" The summit condemned terrorism and extremism, stressing the themes of moderation and tolerance.\n\"Some European countries insist on saying that during World War II, Hitler burned millions of Jews and put them in concentration camps,\" Ahmadinejad said. \"Any historian, commentator or scientist who doubts that is taken to prison or gets condemned. Although we don't accept this claim [of the holocaust], if we suppose it is true... If the Europeans are honest they should give some of their provinces in Europe -- like in Germany, Austria or other countries -- to the Zionists and the Zionists can establish their state in Europe. You offer part of Europe and we will support it.\"\nRabbi David Saperstein, head of the Religious Action Center of Reform Judaism, called the comments a \"repugnant distortion of history.\"\nUnited Nations (UN) Secretary-General Kofi Annan urged all UN States to combat Holocaust denial, and to \"educate their populations about the well established historical facts of the Holocaust, in which one third of the Jewish people were murdered, along with countless members of other minorities.\"\nTension between Israel and Iran began before the 1979 Islamic Revolution when the Israelis joined the United States in siding with the Shah before he was deposed. Recent tensions between Iran and Israel over the nuclear activities in Tehran and Israel's many existing nuclear bombs and missile delivery systems have increased as a result of Ahmadinejad's comment.\n\"Just to remind Mr. Ahmadinejad, we've been here long before his ancestors. Therefore, we have a birthright to be here in the land of our forefathers and to live here. Thank God we have the capability to deter and to prevent such a statement from becoming a reality,\" said Ra'anan Gissin, Israel Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's adviser.\nIsraeli Foreign Minister Silvan Shalom said the statement should be a wake up call to all of us around the world. \n\"We should do everything we can in order to stop him, and to stop the Iranian effort to develop a nuclear bomb,\" said Shalom.\n\"[Ahmadinejad's comment] further underscores our concerns about the regime in Iran,\" said White House press secretary Scott McClellan. \"It's all the more reason why it's so important that the regime not have the ability to develop nuclear weapons.\" \nReactions from Iranians.\nThe Iranian blogger Babak Seradjeh reacted to Ahmadinejad's comments by stating, \"I wondered why Mr. Ahmanedinejad doesn't provide the Palestinians with a piece of Iran. ... Such evil remarks in blatant [sic] disregard of documented history is nothing new of course coming from the kind of people that Mr. Ahmadinejad represents. Denying the Holocaust, calling to wipe a country off the map, or to move it, are all the stuff of my generation's childhood, in school, on the radio and on TV, in the bold and thick slogans on the walls, the streamlined propaganda that aimed to penetrate all the space it could find in our brains.\"\nAnother Iranian blogger, Shahram Kholdi, had responded to Ahmadinejad's earlier comments about \"wiping Israel off the map of the earth\" by saying that Ahmadinejad was calling for ethnic-cleansing. In response to the new statements, Kholdi has pointed out that \"His Excellency President Dr. Ahmadinejad's\" new comments \"clarify\" Ahmadinejad's point of view beyond any doubt. Kholdi's response included the direct statement: \"First, Mr. President, if you do not know history please Shut up!\""}

Union members gathered at Jacob Javits today and unanimously approved a strike authorization if the negotaions between the TWU and MTA fail. Among the many disagreements are the MTA's employee rules and salary increases.\nMTA employees have complained about the rule that requires them to call and alert a supervisor prior to taking a bathroom break of no more than ten minutes. Workers have pointed out that supervisors are not always accessible, especially during the overnight shifts. Another rule in dispute is the employee's uniform: \"Sikh workers, whose religion requires they wear a turban, must wear one made of TA-issued fabric with the TA logo front and center.\" But the major sticking point has been the pay raises. The union has demanded an 8% increase per year for the next three years, but the MTA has offered 5% over two years. The MTA was running a deficit during the previous contract negotiation in 2002, forcing the TWU to accept what the MTA offered. But now, reportedly US$1 billion in the black and offering free rides for the holidays to its riders, the union is looking to cash in on the MTA's good fortunes.\nThe TWU began broadcasting radio advertisements on the news stations 1010 WINS-AM and 880 WCBS-AM to gain public support. Part of it goes \"MTA bosses are making buses run faster, while carrying more people, and don't even give the operators enough time for a bathroom break\" and \"Security alert levels are still high, but MTA bosses are taking conductors off trains, closing token booths and installing turnstiles that make emergency evacuation very difficult.\"\nMichael Bloomberg had stressed in the negotiations of 2002 that the city would enforce the Taylor Law, which prohibits public employees from striking and fines strikers two days wages each striking day. Echoing his previous position three years ago, Mayor Bloomberg said \"They should stay in a room until they come to an agreement.\" Corporation Counsel Michael Cardozo said a strike could cost as much as US$10 million a day in police overtime and other expenses. \nThe last transit strike was in April 1980, and lasted for eleven days. TWU President Roger Toussaint called the proposed health provisions, pension givebacks, and wage increase \"an insult to our members\", and went on to suggest that the odds of a strike were 50/50. Both Toussaint and chief MTA negotiator Gary Dellaverson said they were confident that a strike could be averted, but union members made clear that they will strike if - or as most commuters fear, \"when\" - the negotiations fail and the deadline is passed."}

BBC News 24 reported an additional, fourth large explosion. are currently treating the explosion as an accident. \nReports say the explosion, which registered 2.4 on the , was heard as far away as , and , which is 60km (38 miles) away. Eyewitness statements report that the explosion was heard from at least 160km (100 miles) away and as far away as France and The Netherlands. Pilots reported noticing the blast from the North Sea and the West Country area of the UK. The which runs close by has been closed in both directions near the blast which is causing travel chaos as other roads become congested.\nMalcom Stewart, a BBC News24 eyewitness who is a tanker driver for the site has reported that the site supplies several oil companies and is a joint operation between Total UK and Texaco, it is also used by BP, Shell and the British Pipeline association. The complex is not a refinery but a storage facility for refined petroleum awaiting distribution to airports and filling stations. The eyewitness reports that the depot has approximately 20 tanks which can hold about 3 million gallons (11 million litres or 70,000 barrels) each. Another News24 eyewitness has just reported that he has seen at least 5 of these tanks on fire.\nThe depot operates on a 24 hour basis and is split into 2 parts - aviation fuel and domestic fuel. A number of eyewitnesses have reported on UK news that the aviation fuel side appears to be the part of the site that has been affected.\nLocal authorities were not immediately available for comment but there have been reports of casualties.\nSome reports on live television state that, \"Several other neighbours said they did see a plane go into the depot.\" BBC News 24 were also discussing the idea a possible plane crash as the cause of the explosions. Hertfordshire police have now gone on the record to say that there is no plane involved (BBC News24).\nThe police have issued a contact number 0800 096 0095 and asked that people do not call the emergency services in Hertfordshire directly unless it is an emergency. \nIn addition to being an oil storage depot, it is a major hub on the UK oil pipeline network with pipelines to Killingholme Lindsey Oil Refinery (LOR), Humberside (10 inch), Merseyside (10 and 12 inch), Coryton on the Thames Estuary (14 inch) and Heathrow (6 and 8 inch) and Gatwick airports radiating from it.\nThe disaster is believed to be the worst explosion at a petrochemical plant in the UK since the Flixborough disaster of 1974.\nHertfordshire's Chief Fire Officer Roy Wilsher said: \"This is possibly the largest incident of its kind in peacetime Europe.\" \nA firefighting press officer said that they are stock piling foam from neighboring regions for a prolonged attach which they hope will stop the spread of the fire, however, the inferno itself will have to burn out which could take between 24 hours and a few days.\nDespite the authorities saying that there is no need to panic buy petrol, filling stations have had above average queues since this morning and some small garages have ran out.\nDeputy Prime Minister John Prescott has visited the scene.\nCause.\nPolice are discounting the reports of a small plane being heard nearby just before the explosion.\nAn oil industry specialist reported on BBC News that a vapour leak could have built up to explosive concentrations because of the ground frost in the area keeping vapour concentration at ground level. This would have resulted in a fuel-air explosion. Eyewitnesses report seeing vapour and smelling petrol just before the explosion, leading experts to speculate that there may have been a fuel spillage or vapour leak. A BBC News 24 interview with a petrol tanker driver, who was about to load his tanker at 6am, reported a cloud of mist rolling in from the tank farm area behind the loading bay. All electric lights were turned off and they were ordered to leave the site on foot. As he was doing so a blast blew him off his feet. In another interview a security guard in a nearby office building reported an unusual smell of petrol inside his building before the explosion.\nUK Emergency contact number 0800 096 0095\nPeople calling from outside of the UK should call +44 20 7158 0125"}

By morning, several areas of the city had patches of slippery, low-traction crystalline water lying in wait for the next unsuspecting motor vehicle to pass over them. Soon enough, your correspondent witnessed cars which had slowed to a stop or were parked find that, try as they might, they were unable to move forward on the ice and were therefore stuck.\nLuckily, most of the cars were able to extricate themselves after either slowly accelerating in a low gear, or 'rocking' the car back-and-forth to build up momentum.

He has a right under the British Nationality Act to apply for British citizenship. However, the British Home Office is reportedly fighting the application saying that because he was accused of \"acts that are prejudicial to the United Kingdom\", the British Government would strip him of citizenship immediately - if it were granted.\nMr Hicks' Australian lawyer says: \"What we'll be doing is probably prevailing on the US Government to honour their agreement with the UK Government and release him to the UK and not to subject him to the military commissions,\" said Mr McLeod. \"The UK Government has repatriated its other citizens and we hope they honour that.\"\nDespite the Australian Howard Government's strong support for US military commissions and refusal to ask for Hicks's return to Australia, the British Blair Government has condemned the military commissions as a violation of international law. Britain won agreement from the US Bush Administration that no British citizen would be forced to face trial by military commission, and got its citizens released from Guantanamo Bay.\nHicks' lawyers expect him to be granted British citizenship tonight. They will immediately request the US and British governments release him to Britain. \nHicks, 30, was due to be the first of nine detainees to face the US military commissions last month before a US District Court judge stopped in the proceedings. His trial is due to be held late next year. The US Government detained Hicks since 2001, after his capture in Afghanistan. He has been charged with attempted murder, conspiracy and aiding the enemy. He is believed to be the only Westerner left in Guantanamo Bay prison."}

Mr Falconio's body has never been found. \nMurdoch flagged down Mr Falconio and Ms Lees on a remote Central Australian highway in July 14, 2001. He then shot Mr Falconio and bound Ms Lees with cable ties and threatened her with a gun. \nTelling jurors that he \"entirely agreed\" with their verdict, Chief Justice Brian Martin sentenced Murdoch to a mandatory life sentence. Murdoch's defence lawyer, Grant Algie, indicated an appeal would be lodged against the conviction. \"Obviously we are disappointed with the result,\" he said.\nOutside court, Ms Lees said she hoped Murdoch would tell her and Falconio's family the location of her partner's body. \"Today marks an intense period of distress for myself and the Falconio family. This will enable us to take another step (forward),\" she said.\nThe eight-week trial heard from 85 witnesses and had more than 300 exhibits tendered. The court heard that Mr Falconio and Ms Lees were travelling around Australia when they were flagged down by Murdoch. Murdoch told them he saw sparks coming out of the exhaust of the couple's orange Kombi van and took Mr Falconio to the back of the vehicle to show him. Ms Lees heard a gunshot before Murdoch bound her hands with a pair of cable ties. She managed to escape the van, and hid in bushes for hours until she flagged down a road train.\nDNA matching Murdoch's was found on the T-shirt Ms Lees was wearing when she was found. The court heard it was 150 quadrillion times more likely to match the DNA of Murdoch than any other person in the Northern Territory. Matching DNA was also found on the gear stick of the van and inside the cable ties.\nIn his defence, Murdoch claimed he had nothing to do with the crime. He admitted to the fact he was a drug-runner, detailing numerous trips across Australia. His former drug-running partner also gave evidence, saying he believed Murdoch was filmed at a truckstop after Mr Falconio was murdered. \nMurdoch has been in prison since August 2002. He was arrested in Port Augusta over the abduction and rape of two women in South Australia. He was acquitted of those charges, but immediately arrested over the Falconio case."}

Guerdy Lissade, a lawyer for Sim\u00e9us said the decision was reached unanimously.

If the ruling were to be executed it would probably mean delaying the planned election date of January 8. The ballots for president have already been printed.

Justice Collins said the Government had \"no power to withhold or deprive citizenship\".\nJustice Collins said: \"In my view it would be improper to fail to give assistance which otherwise would have been given, simply because the claimant was believed to be involved in terrorism and has not had any previous connection with this country.\"\nHicks' lawyer, Stephen Grosz, said the decision was a breakthrough. He said there was now no reason why Hicks should not enjoy the same protection as the nine other British citizens released without charge from Guantanamo Bay on representations of the British Government.\nThe British Government has repeatedly condemned Guantanamo as an abuse of legal process. Lawyers acting for British Home Secretary Charles Clarke immediately announced that they would take the matter to the Court of Appeal. But Justice Collins refused the British Government a stay of his judgement, meaning that the Government is compelled to proceed with Hicks' citizenship application.\nThe British Government is anxious not to award Hicks citizenship as it fears that Hicks' reaction would be to immediately renounce his Australian citizenship. This would make Mr Hicks the primary responsibility of the British Government, which could not then strip him of his British citizenship as it would leave him stateless.\nMr Hicks's lawyers argue that the Australian government has refused to plead for his release and has made no attempt to prevent his trial by a US military commission. Whereas the UK government acted to remove its citizens imprisoned at Guant\u00e1namo, and would be compelled to call for the release of Mr Hicks.\nAfter today's ruling, his lawyers will now press the British government to make arrangements for him to take the required citizenship oath and pledge. They will then urge the Home Office to seek his release from the detention centre, in Cuba, and bring him to the UK. \nHicks, a former kangaroo skinner and Muslim convert was caught in Afghanistan in December 2001. He faces charges including conspiracy to commit war crimes and aiding and abetting the enemy, all of which he denies. \nAustralian Responses.\nForeign Affairs Minister Alexander Downer says David Hicks' citizenship is not a matter for Australia. Mr Downer says the Australian Government is neutral about the decision and that it is a matter between Hicks and the British Government.\n\"Once he is a British citizen then what the British Government does in relation to him is matter between him and the British Government - it is not a matter that will involve us and we have made that clear all along,\" he said.\nFederal Opposition Leader Kim Beazley says the outcome is embarrassing and that the Government should have taken a stand in favour of a proper judicial process for Hicks. \"That's the position not taking a strong stand in favour of a proper judicial process puts us in.\"\nGreens Senator Bob Brown implored the Federal Government not to impede Hicks's progress to Britain. Senator Brown is concerned the Government will lean on the British Government to appeal. \n\"It's been an affront to the dignity of Australia, not just the rights of Hicks, that for four years the Australian Government has recognised the kangaroo court system, this military commission and recognised that in Australian law, backed by the Labor Party, when the Australian courts were the right place for Hicks to be right from the outset,\" Senator Brown said.\nFederal Liberal MP Peter Slipper has declared, \"he's their problem and good riddance\". Mr Slipper has since claimed he was joking.\nNews of the ruling is still to reach Hicks but his lawyers say the Home Office must comply with it or appeal. The British Home Office has 14 days to appeal against a High Court ruling. Hicks's Australian lawyer, David McLeod, says his client will remain an Australian citizen as well."}

The law was drafted and passed in three months, an extraordinarily rapid process, and was heavily influenced by earlier UK legislation that failed to pass in Britain.\nUnclarities.\nSignificant aspects of this law are the lack of special measures for security and privacy of the collected data, lack of any rule as to how costs are to be reimbursed. Such measures had been proposed as amendments, but the block vote in Parliament (following a deal between the leaders of the two largest parties, the Christian democrat-conservative European People's Party and the Party of European Socialists, and the European Commission) rejected these amendments.\nAll mention of \"terrorism\" was removed from the original text, so the approved law specifies these measures for \"serious crime\" only. The definition of \"serious crime\" is not specified.\nPartially, the law harmonises existing practice, allowing police forces to rely on retention of data for their investigations. In certain countries, privacy laws that mandated the destruction of such data after six months have hindered investigations. Poland, following one such case, wanted a 15 year data retention period.\nHowever, other influences have made the law much broader than this. Specifically, the requirement to log all subscriber information for Internet communications has raised serious concerns amongst ISPs, and technical analysts. The reason: the term \"communication\" is defined vaguely, as \"all emails and Internet telephony\". There exists no technical means of logging subscriber information for such communications, short of recording every TCP and UDP packet that is carried across a network connection. This would create such huge volumes of data that small to medium ISPs would be unable to operate, and large ISPs would have to increase their prices considerably. All provisions in the law for reimbursement were removed - this is up to each country to decide.\nThus the Data Retention directive, while cracking down on anonymous public communications tools such as open wifi, cybercafes, pre-paid phone cards (and possibly even public phone booths), has ignored the use of web-based email, self-hosted mail servers, chat systems, VPNs, VoIP technologies, and so on. The premise that criminals will restrict themselves to the few simple protocols that can be monitored to extract \"subscriber information\" is weak at best.\nThe technical inadequacy of this law is extreme, and is probably due to its rushed progress through the legislative system. The main driver for this rushed process appears to be a number of national governments that are keen to increase surveillance of their own citizens, and wish EU \"backing\" for such acts. Note that the Commission and Council do not represent an elected body but are composed of the national governments and professional civil service, and there is considerable tension between these bodies and the elected Parliament. It is plausible that the Data Retention directive was just the first of several laws that will pass through this new \"fast track\" process.\nComments.\nThe Foundation for a Free Information Infrastructure, a lobbying association, expects, early in 2006, to see a new attempt to \"harmonise patent legislation\", the so-called \"Community Patent Directive\", which will introduce software patents by the back door. Note that a previous attempt by the Commission and Council to impose software patents (the \"Computer Implemented Inventions directive\") was rejected by Parliament in June 2005.\nOther commentators have noted that the EU produces vast numbers of directives, about ten per month, and most of these get passed into national law only very slowly. Ireland and Germany have stated that they will take this directive to the European Court of Justice. However, that will not prevent other countries from implementing it in a more or less severe form.\nItaly has, in the last few months, been closing cybercafes that do not keep strict records of the identity of every user. It is such indicators that have convinced many privacy advocates that this law is not about terrorism at all, but about monitoring and controlling civil society."}

Motorists will be able to tell if an interchange is open as it will be indicated by signs.\nWestlink M7 claim that the road will take more than 200 people and 12 hours to open and is the longest section of motorway to ever be opened in one day in Sydney.\nThe Westlink M7 motorway has been funded by the Commonwealth Government and private enterprise and is owned by Westlink M7. It is Australia's first toll road to use distance based tolling, with tolls ranging from 40c to $5.97 depending on distance travelled. Tolling is fully electronic with motorists requiring an electronic tag or pass. There are no tollbooths as cash is not accepted.\nThe Westlink M7 motorway will be free to travel on until January 15, 2006."}

The US is under heavy pressure to drop Cotton tariffs and subsidies.\nMali, Burkino Faso, Benin, Chad, and Senegal complain that the tariff free offer does not address the subsidies United States provides to domestic cotton growers. Some countries claim the subsidies against the WTO's anti-dumping policy.\n\"The real problem for African cotton producers is dumping on the world market, resulting from domestic and export subsidies. That is why we need to agree this week on additional disciplines on domestic support\" EU Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson said.\n\"They don't take in any cotton. They export cotton. Their textile industries have all moved abroad. Why would they import any of our cotton? What they need to do is halt the subsidies. Without subsidies they can't produce\" Francois Traore, president of the African Cotton Producers Association, said.\nPortman argued cutting global tariffs are as least as important as cutting subsidies.\nIndia has a 10% tariff on cotton imports, under current WTO rules it could raise the tariff to 100% at any time. China imposes a 1% tariff on the first 4 million bales, after which a tariff of 5% to 40% is applied. By comparison the US allows a small amount of cotton at low duties and then applies a 20% on the remainder.\nA bill in the US Congress this week contains a cotton program known as Step 2, which pays exporters and millers to buy US cotton. The WTO has declared the program illegal.\n\"We know with certainty that it's the US subsidies that are causing problems for our farmers.\" Mamadou Salissou Habi Niger's minister of trade said.\nAfrican cotton producers have said that they will not endorse any deals that emerge from the Hong Kong talks if rich countries do not reduce cotton subsidies to their own farmers."}

In what has been described as disgusting, un-Australian and shameful behaviour, participants in a 5000-strong mob assaulted people suspected of being of Lebanese origin. The angry, alcohol-fuelled crowd also turned on anyone who tried to help the victims, including police, security guards and ambulance officers. \nFollowing an attack on two lifeguards earlier in the week, allegedly by men of Lebanese descent, a protest had been organised via text messages and a small number of usenet postings. \nSutherland Shire Mayor Kevin Schreiber says inflammatory text messages calling for revenge attacks fueled the violence. Mr Schreiber said the heavily-circulated messages ensured troublemakers went to the southern Sydney beach looking for a fight. Police had patrolled the area all weekend after text messages began circulating among the community calling for vigilante responses to unwelcome visitors on the beach.\n\"The sending out of that text message was foolish and irresponsible and ensured that people from all over Sydney came to Cronulla looking to cause trouble and this was further fueled by alcohol,\" said Mr Schreiber.\nSydney's popular talk-back radio station 2GB also promoted Sunday's event. Breakfast announcer Alan Jones has been accused of \"fanning the flames.\" Callers who recommended vigilante action were not discouraged to take the law into their own hands. Mr Jones, notorious for inflammatory comments, repeated the text message for Cronulla residents to defend their territory several times.\nAs the crowd marched along the beach and foreshore area, waving Australian flags, the crowd chanted racist slogans, with many wearing clothes bearing racist sentiment. \nMiddle Eastern men were openly targeted and assaulted. A young Muslim woman wearing a veil was chased into a kiosk on Cronulla beach. Police tried to move her away from the chanting crowd but were unable to reach the security of the command post. While the woman and police officers hid in the kiosk, a crowd surrounded the kiosk and shouted \"Kill the Lebs\", while others climbed on top of the kiosk.\nAs police horses and special operations officers formed a line and pushed the crowd away, they were bombarded with beer bottles. After half an hour, an ambulance arrived at the kiosk and people were loaded into it. The ambulance, transporting six injured youths, escorted by police and police horses, was also bombarded with beer bottles. One struck an ambulance officer on the head. His colleague suffered lacerations to the arm.\nArrests.\nA total of 25 people, including two ambulance officers, were injured and about 40 cars were vandalised at Maroubra as the unrest spread to other beachside communities. Police said 16 people had been arrested and charged with 41 offences. Locals said today they were in shock and many refused to be named, too scared of retribution for their comments.\nThose charged were from Mortdale, Cronulla, Bondi Junction, Kareela, Granville, Lugarno, Greenacre, Mascot, Northmead, Jannali, Sutherland, and Riverwood. Offences included malicious damage, resist police, hinder police, assault police, resist arrest, possess prohibited drug, offensive manner, threaten violence, affray, possess knife in a public place, and driving in a manner dangerous. All of those charged were men between 17 and 40 years of age.\nGovernment response.\nA Police strike force had been established to track down those responsible, NSW Premier Morris Iemma said today. Mr Iemma said video and photo evidence would be used to catch the offenders following incidents which he said showed \"ugly face of racism in Australia\".\nHe said the Government would examine what extra police powers would be needed to combat further outbreaks of violence. A meeting of community leaders would be convened to discuss the problem.\n\"Let's be very clear, the police will be unrelenting in their fight against these thugs and hooligans,\" the Premier said. A series of apparent revenge attacks \u2013 including two stabbings \u2013 occurred overnight following the unrest at Cronulla.\nPrime Minister John Howard, at a separate press conference, condemned the violence. He said attacking anyone on the basis of their race or ethnicity was unacceptable and should be repudiated. He has refused to call Australians \"racist\". He himself created racism-related controversy when in 1988 he claimed that the rate of Asian immigration into Australia was too high.\nResponse from Islamic leaders.\nKuranda Seyit, the director of Forum on Australia's Islamic Relations (FAIR), an Islamic think-tank, was disgusted by the weekends violence. \"The Cronulla police must send a loud and clear message to others who are potentially considering vigilante action against fellow Australians,\" Mr Seyit said. He also condemned the previous violence that was allegedly committed by Lebanese men, but said that this does not justify yesterdays violence. \"I realise that the initial behaviour by the thugs who beat the lifeguard was unacceptable but to take it out any anyone who the mob think are not one of them, is not the solution,\" Mr Seyit said.\nHe suggested that a number of people in Sutherland Shire were racist, and this contributed to the violence. \"Obviously the underlying racism and intolerance in the shire is now bubbling to the surface.\"\nParticipation of \"Neo-Nazis\".\nNSW Deputy Police Commissioner Andrew Scipione says police believed neo-Nazi and white nationalist groups were among the crowd. \"That in fact is something that we're following up,\" he told the Nine network. \nSkinheads wearing boots, braces and neo-Nazi emblems were among the protestors. Three far-right organisations: \"Australia First Party\", \"Patriotic Youth League (PYL) and the Newcastle-based \"Blood and Honour\" - all handed out pamphlets. PYL describes itself as a \"radical nationalist\" group with links to the German-based skinhead group Volksfront, British Nationalist Party and the New Zealand National Front.\nAustralia First's Dr Jim Saleam, who was jailed for 3 1/2 years in 1991 for possessing a firearm and organising a shotgun attack on the home of the African National Congress's Australian representative, said: \"I wouldn't condone it, but I wouldn't condemn it,\" Dr Saleam said his members had recruited up to 120 people for the rally but denied they were involved in violence.\nAnti-race hate campaigner Matt Henderson-Hau, who runs the Fightdemback.org website, claims only one skinhead at the rally came from within the Sutherland Shire. \"The rest came from the Central Coast, Newcastle and other parts of Sydney,\" he said. Mr Henderson-Hau said neo-Nazis had manipulated the crowd at Cronulla. \"If you remove the Nazis from the equation, you will go a long way to dousing the flames and hopefully some cool heads will emerge on both sides,\" he said.\nWhite Nationalist website, Stormfront Downunder, yesterday featured messages from people in the US, Britain and Canada supporting the Cronulla attacks.\nReaction from Sydney bloggers.\nMost bloggers were in agreement that anyone committing acts of violence should be arrested and punished, regardless of race, place of residence, or justification for their actions. Some are purely critical, whereas others are pointing to previous acts by Lebanese youths to explain the violence. \n\"Round \u2018em up\u2014all of them, from both sides\u2014charge \u2018em, convict \u2018em, jail \u2018em,\" Tim Blair said. \n\"Are we living in Tsarist Russia where peasants with pitchforks chase Jews down the street?\" said Jason Soon of catallaxy. He made a distinction between these riots and previous riots, such as Maquarie Fields. \"The denizens of Cronulla do not even have the excuse of poverty and deprivation for their actions. The infamy of disgrace will be heavier on them than on the people of Macquarie Fields.\"\nOne blogger said that he did not support Sunday\u2019s violence, but argued that it was understandable after what he described as years of violence and intimidation by Lebanese youths. \n\"This episode is an absolute disgrace. I, however, absolutely refuse to condemn the people who took that action yesterday, especially given the pattern of wilful inaction from the authorities over the last two years. Far from demonstrating intolerance (arguably, quite the opposite has been demonstrated here, given the facts), put quite simply, everybody has a limit,\" said James Ozark of \"A Western Heart\". \nAnother blogger, who goes by the name \"AnonymousLefty\", issued a challenge to right-wing bloggers and mainstream pundits, asking them to explain how recent events should have been handled. \"What precisely should we be doing differently in order to prevent flare-ups like Cronulla? (If Andrew Bolt and Piers Ackerman are going to devote their next columns to Cronulla - and I'd bet you the shiny biro on my desk that they will - perhaps they'd consider, instead of simply attacking 'multiculturalism' as a vague concept, actually suggesting what they'd do differently.)\"\nSplat Guy criticised the use of the national flag and anthem during the riot. \"... the ugliest thing of all was the use of symbols of the unity of Australians - all Australians, not just Anglos - like the flag, national anthem, and sports cries as a sort of racial identifier. Really unsavoury, really unacceptable, really unaustralian.\"\nHistorical background: The White Australian Policy.\nRacism in post-invasion Australia dates back to the White Australia policy, which started as government policy in the 1880s, became a national law with the creation of Australia as a state in 1901, effectively was stopped in 1973 under the prime ministership of Whitlam, and was completed by further reform in immigration law under Fraser in 1978.

It prescribes procedures for requesting judicial authorization for electronic surveillance and physical search of persons engaged in espionage or international terrorism against the United States on behalf of a foreign power. FISA also allows the Attorney General to grant permission for emergency wiretaps without a warrant, with retroactive application being made within 72 hours. Historically, the vast majority of applications are accepted without modifications by FISA. For example in the 2004 report of FISA to Congress it is noted that the number of approved warrants with substantive modifications was 94 out of a total of 1758 while 5 applications were rejected.\nHouse Intelligence Committee Chairman Peter Hoekstra defended Bush's authorization of the surveillance program and to bypass the FISA. Chairwoman of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee Senator Susan Collins announced a call on the NSA for a \"full briefing\" about the program, and said that the program's authority needs to be clarified. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said Bush's radio address raised \"serious questions as to what the activities were and whether the activities were lawful.\"\nThe President noted that the NSA activities are reviewed \"approximately every 45 days.\" He added: \"During each assessment, previous activities under the authorization are reviewed. The review includes approval by our nation's top legal officials, including the attorney general and the counsel to the president.\" All people involved in the periodic review are members of the executive branch.\nBush also said that NSA's activities under this authorization are thoroughly reviewed by the Justice Department and NSA's top legal officials, including NSA's general counsel and inspector general, adding that \"leaders in Congress have been briefed more than a dozen times on this authority and the activities conducted under it.\" Members of Congress from both parties are now calling for congressional hearings to learn more.\nThe president concluded by saying that \"this authorization is a vital tool in our war against the terrorists. It is critical to saving American lives. The American people expect me to do everything in my power under our laws and Constitution to protect them and their civil liberties.\""}

President Uribe's father was killed by leftist guerillas.\nUribe is a conservative politician and one of the United States closest allies in the region. The ambassador, William Wood, apologized for confusion made by his comments saying that \"there was no intention to interfere in any way with Colombian elections, but rather to support the democratic, free, open and impartial process.\"\nA former ambassador, Myles Frechette, suggests that because the president is up for re-election in May, he might want to demonstrate to the country that Colombia is a sovereign nation."}

Instead, the government has offered to put together a \"narrative of events\".\nBut survivors of the attack argue that a fully comprehensive investigation could teach valuable lessons which may help reduce the likelihood of future attacks, and improve the response capabilities of the emergency services.\nSome survivors, such as Rachel North (a pseudonym), who has been active in organising a support group for her fellow victims, have been angered by the government's alternative proposal of a \"narrative\". Writing on the weblog she started to help her, and others, come to terms with the aftermath of July 7th, Ms North says: \n\"Even if you don't like the questions, don't like the answers, think you know the answers already, Mr Blair, it is us, not you, who are paying the cost for this... If the cost of answering questions makes you squirm, then too bad... We run the risks on the trains, the buses, the streets each day... How dare you presume you know our questions and how dare you presume that they can be answered by a 'narrative of what happened', as if we are children to be placated with a story. I know what happened, I want to know why.\"\nMs North also quotes a number of other survivors: \n\"We are constantly reminded that this is the worst peace time bombing London has ever seen, for something that bad there should be an inquiry. People died, families lost someone they loved and hundreds are still suffering. You can't put a price on that but apparently the government can.\" - \"Fiona\"\n\"If nothing else, an enquiry would make sure some of these lessons were learnt in case, God forbid, anything like this happened again. I thought there were plansin place for emergencies such as this. Whilst the emergency services did a fantastic job on the day, I have been stunningly underwhelmed by the support offered to victims since.\" - \"Pauline\"\nAn anonymous survivor, writing on the \"Yorkshire lass\" website, says:\n\"'When I watched the Al-Qaeda video declaring Jihad against the UK I was haunted by the familiarity of the voice, it was my voice, my accent, my dialect. This is not a man who was recruited and trained in some far off country that I have barely heard of, this was a man who was recruited and trained while he lived 20 minutes from my mother's home where I was born and raised.The words he spoke of are words similar to what I have heard many times from disillusioned\nyoung men that I studied for my A Levels with. They are the words of hatred I overheard when I worked as a support worker at my local college. They were words of students who were educated... when someone follows through with the actions of those opinions to the detriment of others, questions need to be asked why preventions were not put in place and this needs to be done by public inquiry for peace of mind.I have been told that I am looking for justice in the wrong place and in some way that is right. However, I want some sort of justice, some manner of peace of mind, some questions answered and resolutions made. I don't want others to have to go through what myself and hundreds of other commuters did on that Summer's day.'\"\nRelatives of the dead have also been very critical. Quoted on the BBC's website, Saba Mozakka, the daughter of Behnaz Mozakka,who died in the Piccadilly Line explosion, said:\n\"The families will be campaigning for there to be a full public inquiry... A narrative of events will not satisfy anybody. This is not something we will go away on.\" \nMarie Fatayi-Williams, whose son Anthony was killed in the attack, told the BBC: \"I ask myself - if there is really nothing to hide then why shy away from a public inquiry? It is the only real way that we can truly get things discussed and see for ourselves what happened and what lessons can be learnt and whether we are better prepared now than on 7 July... I have a son who was killed and is never going to come back. Nobody is going to tell me that [an inquiry] is a waste of police time.\"\nThe survivors' petition has so far gathered over 100 signatures. The British government has given no response as yet.\nSources.\n "}

But they made a quick come back in the area, and during this past week a hundred of the birds have been disposed of by a shot to their head with a pellet gun.\nThe USDA reports that both Black Vultures (Coragyps atratus), along with their close relatives called the Turkey Vulture (Cathartes aura), are experiencing population increases stretching well over the last 10 years. \nThe species is increasingly a problem by growing into being a nuisance, as well as a threat to health and safety concerns. The presence of the birds in large numbers, at places they roost, can cause damage to property as they peck and claw at construction surfaces, and cause unsanitary human health conditions from the defecation and regurgitation of the birds. Their presense at landfills, often in near proximity to airports, is a problem for airplanes during take-off and landing. \nAt the entrance to the Dutch Gap boat launch parking lot, a large yellow warning sign is posted that reads: \"Please be aware of possible damage to vehicles and trailers due to the large Black Vulture population currently inhabiting this parking area.

The MP said that there was \"compelling and reliable evidence for this carcinogenic substance to be banned from the UK food and drinks market altogether.\"\nReservations of some U.S. Food and Drug Administration scientists about the safety of Aspartame were overridden when the agency initially approved the food additive in 1981, but many other countries followed the U.S. lead in endorsing the chemical sweetener for general public use. Aspartame has been linked in various studies cited by Mr. Williams to brain tumors, anxiety attacks, neurological impairment and other side effects, particularly in experimental animals; however, several reviews by government agencies have found no credible proof of such risk to humans and no country has banned or limited the substance for human consumption and such non-governmental groups as the American Cancer Society and the American Heart Association assert that extensive investigation has not shown any serious adverse effects attributable to Aspartame. Nonetheless, organized groups continue to debate the issue vigorously and there are calls for class action law suits. The initiative by MP Roger Williams may now bring the debate into the open political arena of the House of Commons.\nNew research on combining Aspartame with other common food additives suggests that while each substance alone may be safe enough, some combinations frequently found in commercial products interfere with the development and function of the nervous system in rats.

On the other hand, surveys of human populations, which consume Aspartame in various combinations with artificial colorings and flavorings, have failed to convincingly show significant harm.\nAspartame is sold under the brand names of Equal, Nutrasweet and Canderel and is an ingredient of thousands of \"diet\" or \"lite\" products."}

Sydney has always been a place where people do get along, and today they came out in force to show that,\" Mr Longhurst said.\nIn a statement supporting the rally, Socialist Alliance linked the Cronulla riots to government policies and actions. \"The riots reflect the rising racism in Australia, a tide that has been fostered by the Howard government\u2019s policies and propaganda that criminalise and lock up refugees, dehumanise and bomb the Iraqi people, and define all Muslims and Middle-Eastern Australians as potential terrorists.\"\nOne Sydney blogger criticised the rallies because they focused on racism against minority groups such as Lebanese, instead of racism in general. \"They're picking on only one face of the disgusting racism that has come to a boil in this city recently, and tried to say they're taking a stand against racism,\" he said, calling the rally \"the racist anti-racism protest.\""}

The program has plans for a moon based astronomical telescope and extensive research of the moon\u2019s geology. Ouyang Ziyuan, who heads the moon research program, has explained one particular interest is the helium-3 isotope.

They intend to follow up with landlers and sample collection as early as 2017.\nStarted in 1992, the Chinese space program has made rapid progress. Shenzhou 6 was their second manned mission and cost China roughly 110 million, quite inexpensive when compared to the space missions of other countries. The programs extensive plans hint that now, more than ever, the program\u2019s progress is heavily dependent on funding.

The MTA offered a three-year contract with a 3 percent, 4 percent, and 3.5 percent pay-raise schedule and a retirement age that would stay at 55, but new employees would have to pay more in contributions to the pension and health care plan.\nToussaint had said earlier today to striking and bus operators that he could not accept the MTA's offer because it did not address disciplinary actions that the MTA could levy against their employees. Jamaica and Triboro busses began striking 00:01 (05:01) Monday morning. Both bus lines are privately owned and operated, but their employees are TWU members and will become part of the MTA's bus service in 2006.\nThe TWU had asked the MTA to give its last, best offer by 21:00 Monday (02:00 Tuesday UTC) so that executives would be able to evaluate the terms in time to avert the Tuesday morning strike deadline. But when Toussaint and Kalikow parted last night at 23:00, any hope of preventing the incredible turned into awaiting the inevitable strike declaration.\nAt his 03:02 press conference, Toussaint pointed the finger squarely on the MTA.\n\"With a US$1B surplus, the contract between the MTA and TWU Local 100 should have been a no-brainier. Sadly that has not been the case. From the beginning, the MTA approached these negotiations in bad faith, demanding arbitration before even trying to resolve the contract. Hours before contract expiration, the MTA got rid of its US$1B surplus -- a surplus which we believe continues to be understated by some US$100M. The MTA knew that reducing health and pension standards at the authority would be unacceptable to our union. They knew there was no good economic reason for their hard line on this issue - not with a US$1B surplus.\"\nThen, the words that no one in New York City (except maybe public school students whose classes were delayed by two hours) wanted to hear passed from Toussaint's lips: \"The Local 100 Executive Board has voted overwhelmingly to extend strike action to all MTA properties effective immediately.\"\nThe strike was \"on.\"\nMayor Bloomberg lashed out at the TWU with his harshest language yet on the strike. \"For their own selfish reasons, the TWU has decided that their demands are more important than the law, the City and the people they serve. This is not only an affront to the concept of public service; it is a cowardly attempt by Roger Toussaint and the TWU to bring the City to its knees to create leverage for their own bargaining position.\" His Honor concluded, \"We cannot give the TWU the satisfaction of causing the havoc they desperately seek to create.\" \nMayor Bloomberg estimated the cost of the strike at US$400 million per day.\nThis morning the Mayor crossed the Brooklyn Bridge into Manhattan, alongside his fellow commuters-turned-pedestrians. But the bitter wind coming from the East River only doubled the frigid mood of the already freezing New Yorkers: TWU members were picketing on the Brooklyn entrance to the bridge.\nContingency Plans.\nThe MTA.\nThe strike contingency page on the MTA website mirrored Kalikow's statement to the press: \"The TWU announced it would conduct an illegal strike on MTA NYCT buses &amp; subways throughout all five boroughs as well as on most MTA Bus Company routes. This is in addition to a strike action called at 12:01 Monday, December 19, 2005 by the TWU against two private bus lines in Queens: Triboro Coach &amp; Jamaica Buses.\"\nIn his press conference Kalikow said \"The TWU's action today is illegal and irresponsible. This blatant violation of the ... it is a slap in the face to all MTA customers and all New Yorkers.\"\nAlthough contingency plans had been in ready since Friday, some aspects have not materialized. has reported that service for the park-n-ride will not be in service until 09:00 because the equipment needed to run on the strike contingency schedule has not been put in place.\nThe LIRR will be making additional stops in Queens on the Main Line, as well as operating shuttle trains between and and in Brooklyn between Jamaica and . Riders going to or coming from , which is normally served by the train, can take the LIRR to Flushing/Main St. on the branch.\nAll riders are advised that several entrances to Penn Station have been designated for ticketed passengers only and are specific to the passenger's servicing branch. Non-ticketed passengers should enter Penn Sat. through the 7th Avenue entrance.\nThe MTA assures its customers that all contingency service will be in place no later than the Wednesday morning rush, and that any holders of 7-day, 30-day, and Unlimited will have their expiration dates extended for as many days as the strike lasts.\nThe City.\nAt 05:00 put roadblocks into action along 96th St., south of which only high-occupancy vehicles carrying at least four passengers (\"-4\") may enter. reported that even commercial vehicles are subject to the HOV-4, including taxis. This lead to some early-hour contingency \"confusion and kvetching\".

Preston claims that at this time he had no communication from the police.\nAfter reading about himself in various Slovenian newspapers in early December, Preston decided to take his suprnova.org site offline. At the same time another project Preston was involved in eXeem was touted as being the biggest thing to happen to file sharing.\nPreston claims that a month or so after his site went offline his home was raided by the police at 6:30 in the morning. Police seized two computers and documents. Preston was then called into the local police unit another month later for a hearing. Preston, on the advice of his lawyer decided he would not answer anything during the interview with the police. At the conclusion of the interview Preston was told that the matter would be handed over to the prosecutor.\nPreston recalls that on October 18, 2005 he received a notice to go to the post office and pick up another letter which he must sign for. Upon receiving the notice Preston says that he \"became completely depressed and sad\". Preston however was greeted with good news at the post office when he opened the letter and discovered that his matter had been dropped. He also received his computers and CDs back.\nBackground.\nThe BitTorrent protocol uses .torrent metadata files that tells a client application which tracker to contact to find peers (users sharing the file) and verification data for the files to be downloaded. It was thought to be \"safer\" than traditional file sharing systems from a legal perspective as the files (possibly copyrighted material) were not hosted on a centralised server but were instead located completely on users' computers.\nDue to the nature of BitTorrent a server is required to \"track\" (assist in locating other peers). These trackers can be a legal target because they \"assist\" in distributing the data. It is also quite easy for the administrator of a BitTorrent tracker to remove torrents and stop users from downloading them.\neXeem on the other hand was to be completely decentralised. There was no need for centralised trackers, as each peer on the network acted as a tracker by assisting other clients in finding peers. eXeem had a rather difficult time becoming accepted within the internet community following the discovery of Cydoor adware in the software. Development on eXeem has since ceased.\nSuprnova itself was not a BitTorrent tracker nor did it host the actual files being downloaded by the user. Suprnova made available the .torrent meta data files needed to locate a tracker and peers."}

The poll was conducted by Pollara, a Canadian public opinion and research company. Of those polled, 37% responded that they would likely vote for the Liberals, 34% Conservative, 17% New Democratic Party and 10% for the Bloc Qu\u00e9becois.\nThe results show a drop in the Liberals' initial lead, from 7 points to 3, and it puts the Liberals and the Conservatives within the polls margin of error of 3.7%. However, the report indicates that much of that decline is a result of Alberta residents increasingly in favour of the Conservatives, led by Stephen Harper. Given Alberta's seat apportionment in parliament, Conservative gains on their established plurality there are not enough to have a major effect on the seat totals. Although the Green Party has announced they will be running members in every riding, their results were not reported by Pollara.\nIn its analysis of the results, Pollara commented that \"[t]he electorate has rarely been so polarized as in this election. If only rural Canadians were voting, we would have a Majority Conservative Government. If only urban Canadians were voting, we would have a Minority Liberal Government. Women would elect a Liberal Majority, while men would select a Conservative Minority. Young Canadians, 18-24, would easily elect an NDP majority\". Pollara also indicated that the Bloc Qu\u00e9becois would win a clear majority among voters in Qu\u00e9bec.\nPollara conducted the study by telephone and polled 1208 people. Only those who indicated they were very likely to vote were asked what party they would likely vote for. 708 respondents were asked their potential endorsement and the poll is accurate to 3.7% plus or minus.\nCanadians are scheduled to vote January 23, 2006. This early election stemmed from the ruling Liberal Party government's loss in a motion of no confidence. The Liberal government has faced strong opposition from the NDP, Conservatives and Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois as a result of an embarrassing sponsorship scandal. "}

One person was reported killed.\nThe incident is already under investigation by the Italian authorities and the Italian state Railway Operator, Trenitalia. As yet the reasons for the collison are unclear.\nRelief efforts are being made difficult by the dark and cold weather.\nThe two trains were travelling on the same line, in the same direction, with different destinations. The first one (regional train number 3361) departed from the Roma Termini station, in Rome at 13:47 and was a local service to Cassino, stopping at the major stations along the route. The scheduled time of arrival was 15:38. The second train (inter-regional 2361) also left from the Rome terminus, at 14:15, and was heading in the same direction, with a final destination of Campobasso. The scheduled time of arrival was 17:27, and the first stop first stop was at Cassino, scheduled at 15:42.\nAround 15:00 the first train had stopped at the station of Roccasecca, and was just to restart its journey, when the second train came at high speed on the same rail, slamming into the back of it. The locomotive of the second train was pushed over the first train and landed on the last carriage of that train.

The two train drivers of the second train said that they did not see red signals, but only green signals. It was alleged that the train has been misrouted. Actually if the second train had to pass the station without stopping and overtaking the first train it seems resonable that it would pass on a different track.

Under a 1974 agreement with Australia, traditional Indonesian fishermen are permitted to take fish within a 12 nautical mile radius of Ashmore Reef, Cartier Island, Scott Reef, Seringapatam Reef and Browse Island. Often the fishermen caught are traditional fishermen who navigate by the sun, stars and with the wind, so with no visible borders, they often mistakenly fish in illegal waters.\nSome fishermen are professionally profiteering on catching sharks for their valuable fins while throwing away the rest of the sharks body. There is even confusion as to who could be defined as a \"traditional fisherman\" and who is just profiteering illegally. Fisherman who persist and get caught more than once can end up in detention.

The fleet - owned by Kyodo Senpaku and part-owned by Nissui, Japan's second-largest marine products firm - is also targeting endangered fin whales for what they claim is a scientific program. Fin whales are the second largest creatures on earth.\nGreenpeace say they have asked the whalers to stop whaling immediately and return to Japan, but have received no response from the vessels. In inflatables carrying banners which read \"defend the whales\" and \"stop the whaling,\" crew from the two ships declared their intention to stop the hunt. \nLeader of the Greenpeace expedition, Shane Rattenbury said their eight small boats have begun to \"interfere\" with the whaling process. \n\"We positioned our two ships to the stern of the Japanese mother ship in order to prevent the whale being transferred on to the ship and we were successful in stopping that process for about 45-minutes,\" said Mr Rattenbury, describing a capture boat ramming the Greenpeace ship in an attempt to push it clear. \nHe said the Japanese boat fought back with water cannons and one of several Greenpeace inflatables capsized in the wash. All crew were retrieved without injury. \n\"We're going to do everything we can over the coming weeks to interfere with the whaling process, and stop the whales being killed,\" he said, \"our small boats will be putting themselves between the harpoon and the whale. \nIn a radio call to the whaling vessels, from the bridge of the Arctic Sunrise, Yuko Hirono, of Greenpeace Japan called upon the whalers to stop killing whales \"and leave the internationally recognised Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary.\" Japan's scientific whaling has been the subject of repeated criticism by the International Whaling Commission. \nThe Japanese Institute of Cetacean Research, claim the amount of scientific data gathered by Japan's research program (JARPAII) is extensive and that Japan's whale research programs are conducted in accordance with the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling. The Institute of Cetacean Research say their research does not involve illegal whaling.\nGreenpeace say over the next 2 years, 40 more fin whales will be added to the annual kill, along with 50 humpback whales. \n\"This whale hunt is unnecessary, unjustified, and unwanted,\" said Rattenbury. \"Once the whales have been measured and weighed by the 'scientists' the butchers get to work and the whales are cut up and boxed for market. This is all about money and not science.\"\nThe area in which the Japanese fleet is hunting has been designated as the Antarctic Whale Sanctuary, in an effort to allow whale populations to recover after stocks were depleted during the commercial whaling of the last century. \nSeventy crew and campaigners from 19 countries are on board the two Greenpeace vessels, including the UK, Netherlands, Canada, Australia, Ghana, Russia, Norway, Denmark, USA, France, Italy, Japan, Ireland, India, New Zealand, Spain, Sweden, Austria and Argentina.\nJapan's whaling program is expected to kill nearly one thousand whales this season."}

This is also been observed with other more common flu virus types. The chances of Tamiflu-resistance arising during H5N1 infections might be enhanced by two properties of H5N1; its ability to replicate rapidly and its ability to infect the gastrointestinal tract.

The study endorses the use of nuclear energy and attacks some of the data used by anti-nuclear campaigners. \nThe scientists from the University of Melbourne say their research shows that the benefits of nuclear energy have been underestimated and concerns about nuclear waste overplayed. \nThe six month study compared the environmental impact, health risks, economic effects and social implications of the use of fossil fuels, renewable energy sources such as wind and solar energy, and nuclear power.\nAccording to the Melbourne University, the investigation will significantly impact the nuclear debate in Australia, with findings showing that hundreds of times more uranium could be available than was predicted in a widely quoted European study. \nAssociate Professor Martin Sevior, of Melbourne University's school of physics, claims the recent study bolsters the case for Australia to invest more in nuclear energy. Sevior says his research into nuclear waste disposal should help dispel many environmentalists' fears.\n\"One thing that's perhaps not always realised is that the amount of waste that comes out of a typical plant is around 30 tonnes a year, he said. \"The amount of waste that comes out of a coal-fired power plant is around 1,000 tonnes a day.\" \nProf Sevior says his study has exposed flaws in the European study into the limits of the uranium industry. \"This previous research overestimated the energy costs and carbon emissions generated by the construction of nuclear power plants and for mining uranium,\" Prof Sevior said.\nThe Australian Conservation Foundation's (ACF) nuclear campaigner, Dave Sweeney, says the study appears flawed and does not provide a sound argument for the use of nuclear energy.\n\"It glances over some really key concerns of proliferation, key areas of reactor safety are not delved into too deeply and they have direct links to industry websites for further information,\" said Mr Sweeney. \"I'm not sure it's altogether appropriate or altogether balanced to be referring people to the nuclear industry's own websites for further information on such matters as radioactive waste, nuclear weapons and nuclear reactor safety.\" \nThe six-month study found Australia has more uranium than was previously thought. \"We have enough uranium in Australia to power the country for thousands of years,\" said Prof Sevior.\nFriends of the Earth nuclear campaigner Dr Jim Green said nuclear power should never be considered as an energy source. He said greenhouse emissions saved by switching to nuclear power were only about 5 per cent of total emissions and could only be achieved if thousands of reactors were installed globally. \nDr Green said an energy debate in Australia was necessary, but it had to go beyond just the nuclear alternative.

Over Half of the highway between the F3 freeway terminus at Beresfield on Newcastle and the Queensland border is still single carriageway.\nDespite the New England Highway being the \"national\" highway from the F3 to Brisbane, traffic along the Pacific Highway is almost three times heavier on most sections . By 2021, traffic on the Pacific Highway is expected to rise by 35 percent.\nThe New South Wales Roads and Traffic Authority estimates that to complete the dual carriageway \"North Coast Motorway\" (Pacific Highway upgrade) by 2016 would cost $AU8 Billion. Since the major upgrades began in 1996, $AU2.2 Billion has been spent. Around 40 to 50 people die on the Pacific Highway every year.\nMr Lloyd said \"If there are sections of the Pacific Highway where you can get private sector involvement, get it built quickly, provide value for money for those who wish to use it and alternative routes for those who choose not to, then I think let's go for it\". The proposal could introduce tolls on some sections of the highway with other sections (that are completely publically funded) remaining toll free.\nThe plans have drawn mixed results from transport groups. A spokesperson for the NRMA, the largest motorist's organisation in NSW said that tolls should only be considered as a \"last resort\". He further added that if the only way the road could be upgraded was by use of tolls then the NRMA would agree with conditions. He said that any toll should not exceed $AU20.\nTourism and transport lobby group TTF Australia welcomed the move but warned that NSW north coast communities should not be disadvantaged through the introduction of a toll. Managing director Chris Brown said \"We don't expect north coast communities to pay 10 bucks to go and get a bottle of milk\"."}

This would mark the 4th time the presidential elections have been moved, and the 5th time for all elections.\nThe chairman of the council, Max Mathurin, expressed concern over political unrest that could occur if conditions were not adequate to ensure fair elections. He said, \"If certain major technical problems are not solved, elections on Jan. 8 could be a catastrophe.\" The problems related to the current possible postponement involve distribution of voter identification cards, a lack of poll centers, and recruitment of poll center workers. According to Reuters, only 500,000 of the 3.5 million voter identification cards have been handed out and few of the 40,000 needed poll workers have been recruited.\nRosemond Pradel, Secretary-General of the electoral council, told reporters that sometime between January 22 and January 29 would likely be the new dates of the elections are indeed rescheduled. However one council member, Patrick Fequiere, suggested that several months might be needed to guarantee fair elections. Pradel blames the delays, in part, on the Organization of American States (OAS). He is quoted as saying, \"Our decision to set the January 8th deadline for the first round was based on OAS' commitment that voting cards distribution would have been completed by December 25.\"\nHowever the OAS struck back in Friday saying that \"Ninety per cent of the cards are already in the electoral centres, waiting for people to pick them up,\" and \"Our problem is that most voters have stopped coming to the centres,\" according to OAS spokeperson Louise Brunet. Denneth Modeste, OAS ambassador to Haiti, says that people are not coming to the centres to pick up their cards because they don't believe the elections will take place as scheduled. She said that \"the Provisional Electoral Council should be the leading agency inciting people to collect their cards, instead of spreading doubts.\"\nOne presidential candidate, Evans Paul, complained about the problems saying \"I've never seen elections so poorly organized,\" and \"it's not acceptable that people have to struggle for hours in line to register, they have to do the same to get the voting cards, and now they have to walk six hours to reach a place to cast their ballot.\"\nMax Mathurin says that they should know by next week whether or not the current date of January 8, 2006 is a realistic target for holding the first round of the presidential elections. Juan Gabriel Valdes of the UN's peacekeeping missions says that his people are completely ready for elections if they are to take place on January 8th."}

Those who favor independence are in a small minority. Currently Puerto Ricans are U.S. citizens and receive many of the benefits that the federal government offers, but cannot vote in national elections and do not pay federal taxes. If Puerto Rico were to become a state of the U.S., it could mean a shift in the balance of power in Congress and in presidential elections.\nThe press release including the question and answer section can be viewed .

President Uribe is expected to strike back as a result of this attack. According to Reuters, President Uribe is up for reelection in May and this attack could be related to that. Uribe has negotiated peace agreements with some rebel groups, such as the marxist National Liberation Army, but FARC has refused to speak with the Uribe administration. This attack is the worst that has happened since Uribe came into office in 2002. Uribe's father was killed in a kidnapping attempt by FARC in 1983."}

The announcement has come with great applause at home, but according to CNN it has led to a temporary decrease of the value of the Argentine peso in international markets. Payment was originally scheduled for 2008, and paying off the debt early will save Argentina around $1 billion dollars. The payment is made out of the Central Bank foreign currency reports, which according to CNN total $28 billion.\nThe economic crisis in Argentina started with a recession in 1999. People began to withdraw money from their accounts, which resulted in the government freezing bank accounts. Eventually the country would have to default on a large part of their public debt. The crisis led to the increase of the income gap between the rich and the poor, but policies in recent years have brought that back down to previous levels. Argentina had previously renegotiated private debt earlier this year of $100 billion which reduced the amount owed by 75% according to ABC News."}

Richard suffered from chronic sickle-cell anaemia.\nThe boy's father, Protais Ntiranyi had been in the country just 18 hours when he woke, at 4am on November 5 to find his son convulsing. Mr Ntiranyi who was alone with his family in a Fairfield flat was frightened and confused as he did not know what to do to help his son.\nThe family's case worker, from a company called the Australian Centre for Languages (ACL), had earlier shown them a telephone in the flat and allegedly told them to dial 000 in case of emergency. Mr Ntiranyi had never used a telephone and could not speak English.\nMr Ntiranyi, roamed the neighbourhood screaming for help in his native language. The only attention Mr Ntiranyi got was that of a Sudanese refugee, who couldn't understand what he was saying but knew he was clearly distressed and in need of help. By the time he brought the neighbour to his flat his son had died.\nDenial of food.\nTwo sisters and another woman from Africa, considered refugees have made claims that they were not provided with food by ACL.\nPrincess and Yeah Yeah Gbdeah arrived in Sydney on November 4, 2005 and were relocated to Newcastle. The sisters allege that when they arrived in Newcastle, a case worker from ACL presented them with a 12-month lease to sign. They claim that when they refused to sign the lease as they were afraid and unfamiliar with the area that the case worker told them they would not be given any food vouchers.\nA third woman, Caroline Nykango, was with the sisters and signed the lease. She was given a $50 food voucher, but did not know how to use it as she had never used a supermarket.\nAccording to the women the only food in the house was an apple, a packet of rice and some oil. The women went without food for 5 days before walking out and meeting a man on the street who took them to a church for assistance.\nPrincess said \"There was no food to eat, she didn't show us how to use the stove, we were sick, we were afraid\". \"We were told a case worker would come to see us but no case worker came. We told her we didn't want that home, we don't want to sign and she said, 'We will not give you the vouchers unless you sign, we will not give you the food'\".\nJenny Witmarsh from ACL said the circumstances described by the women \"are not the facts as I understand them\".\nThe two sisters are now living in a house in Hamilton, organised with the help of local citizens.\nThe matter had been referred to an independent inquiry, which should be completed in early February.\nBackground and Criticisms.\nIn October the federal government awarded a multi-million dollar contract to ACL for the care and resettlement of refugees - work that was previously carried out by non-profit and volunteer organisations.\nIt is believed that only days before Richard's death doctors at the Newcastle Refugee Health Clinic had written to the Immigration Department warning the government that problems relating to the health of new arrivals in Australia had emerged in the Hunter Valley. ACL also had the contract for the care of refugees in the Hunter Valley.\nOrganisations which formerly provided care to refugees have strongly criticised ACL saying that they can not provide the level of care that these people require.\nThe family of Richard Niyonsaba have called on the federal government to review its policy of outsourcing refugee services. The federal government is unlikely to hold an inquiry with the Minister for Multicultural Affairs and Citizenship, John Cobb disagreeing with the family's version of events.\nGreg Barnes from Rights Australia is calling for a review saying \"We have a child who comes in to Australia who's obviously extremely ill and his parents are really, on the face of it, given very little or no support at all\".\nSources.\n "}

He called his parents on the telephone and informed them of where he was and his intention to visit Iraq. This was the first time his parents learned of his plans. He then attempted to cross the Kuwait-Iraq border by taxi, but because of tight security for the upcoming elections he was unable to pass through, and spent a week in Beirut, Lebanon, interviewing minority Christians. Then on December 25, he flew in to Baghdad International Airport. Relatives picked him up from the airport and put him at a hotel known to frequently house American citizens.\nHe financed the trip and made all the arrangements himself with money that he had saved up.\nThe inspiration for his journey was the result of a segment of his English class on 'immersion journalism' at his school, Pine Crest School. He was working on an assignment on the war in Iraq and he wished to experience his subject matter first-hand.\nHassan contacted the Associated Press to announce that he was in Iraq to do research and humanitarian work. They were shocked to see an American teenager walking around unaccompanied. They in turn immediately contacted the US Embassy, who had been contacted by his parents and were on the lookout for him. Hassan's parents were born in Iraq, but he does not speak any Arabic, making him easily stand out as a foreigner in Iraq, where kidnappings of Americans and violence are an everyday occurrence. His parents planned to take him to see Iraq once the war was over.\nU.S. Consul General Richard Hermann reiterated the U.S. Embassy's strong warning to U.S. citizens against traveling to Iraq as he announced that Hassan was with American troops and was on his way home.\nHe turned in his assignment via email and is due back home over the New Years Day weekend."}

Meanwhile, two major fires have broken out on the New South Wales Central Coast, North of Sydney with another in Sydney.\nThe Victorian fire has destroyed 5 homes in the Stawell and two people have been injured when they fell down a mineshaft while fighting the blaze. Reports claim that the fire front was up to 30Km in length. Earlier today the fire was burning out of control, being fanned by strong winds. This afternoon a weather change came, dumping heavy rain over the region.\nFive major fires have been reported on the NSW Central coast in the Woy Woy and Mount White regions. 50 homes are believed to be under direct threat. Residents in affected parts of Woy Woy, Umina and Pearl beaches, and Patonga, have been taken to makeshift evacuation centres at the Gosford Leagues Club and Woy Woy Bowling Club.\nThe Sydney Newcastle (F3 freeway) and Pacific Highway have been closed. Motorists which had been standed on the southbound carriageway of the F3 freeway were allowed through at around 6PM AEDT following fears of a wind change which could have put them in danger of the fire. Police say that the backlog was let through and the freeway remains closed.\nIntercity train services North of Sydney have also been affected with the railway line closed at Berowra.\nDozens of fire crews and four water bombing aircraft were battling the blazes, according to bushfire volunteer Michael Wood, with changeable wind conditions starting spot fires nearby. Strong north-westerly wind gusts and temperatures of up to 44 degrees posed extremely dangerous fire conditions, the Rural Fire Service said.\nThe Woy Woy fire front was expected to make a run to Umina and Pearl Beach in the coming hours. 300 firefighters are working to contain the flames.\nCameron Wade, a spokesman for the NSW Rural Fire Service said firefighters were battling flames up to 30 metres in height, destroying several homes. A Fire Station near Woy Woy was also destroyed along with several fire trucks and volunteers cars.\nMr Wade also said that crews were being called in from Sydney and the Hunter to assist local fire crews. Six aircraft and a sky crane are also being used.\nIt is believed that winds in the Central Coast region are gusting at up to 60 km/h.\nAnother fire in the Sydney suburb of Belrose is expected to cause problems in the next few hours.\nIn Merimbula, on the NSW far south coast residents are being evacuated, after a fire broke containment lines.\nPhill Koperberg, Commissioner of the NSW Rural Fire Service said there were fires concern at Junee and Cootamundra in southern NSW and at Appin and Bulli south of Sydney.\nAccording to an RFS spokesman, a house in Junee was destoyed and a farmer was hospitalised after receiving burns to 60 percent of his body. A total of five homes in the Junee area have been confirmed lost.\nAbout 100 people have been evacuated from Junee's outskirts amid fears that southerly winds could reach 100 kph, drastically worsening the fire situation.\nThree homes on the Central Coast and three in Junee have been lost."}

Gazprom, Russia's natural gas behemoth, began cutting off supplies at 7:00 a.m. UTC Sunday, January 1. \nGazprom claims to have taken this action because Ukraine refuses to pay the market rate for natural gas which is approximately four times higher than the price previously agreed upon by the two. Ukraine has stated that they are not averse to higher prices but believe they ought to be introduced sequentially. Additionally, Russia does not want to honor its contract to supply gas at $50 per 1000 cubic meters until 2008. By comparison, gas produced by OPEC costs $11.4 per 1000 cubic feet (December 28, 2005), equivalent to $402.6 per 1000 cubic meters, an 8-fold rebate.\nGazprom spokesman Sergei Kupriyanov said enough gas was still being piped via Ukraine to maintain deliveries to other countries, and if they were not getting all their gas, it meant Ukraine was tapping into it. Eighty percent of Russian gas exports to Western Europe pass through Ukraine. \n\"We have information from the ground that shows Ukraine has started illegally siphoning off Russian gas destined for European consumers,\" Kupriyanov said. \nUkraine is of the position that since Russia will not live up to the agreement to sell at $50 per 1000 cubic meters until 2008, Ukraine as a transiting country, has the right to offset the illegal cost increase with seizure of Russian assets - namely the gas going through the pipelines in Ukraine.\nSergei Kupriyanov, press secretary to Gazprom's chief executive, said \"Negotiations reach a deadlock when it comes to discussing actual figures ... They have called on us to use price parameters that probably existed in the late 1990s in 2006, which is impossible ... The price of gas and other energy resources has risen considerably over the past few years.\"\nThe dispute is also tied to the political situation between the two countries. Although a private business, the largest individual shareholder in Gazprom is the Russian government which owns slightly less than 40%. The dispute was further politicized by the personal intervention of Vladimir Putin who offered Ukraine the chance to delay paying market prices for a further three months. Critics of the current Russian government have argued that Gazprom's action has been an attempt to punish Ukraine for forging closer links with the West following the Orange Revolution. Putin's advocates, however, have argued that the status quo is akin to a budgetary transfer between the two governments and costs Russia about US$4.5 billion per year. \nSpecial European commission has already counted gas independently,and confirmed its loss. But Ukraine disagrees,saing,that it is unjust.German Kanzler Angela Merkel hopes,that the conflict will end soon. \nAnd a recent poll conducted by VTSIOM suggests that 80% of Russian citizens support the move by Gazprom. Ukraine has threatened to retaliate by raising the rent that Russia's navy pays to use the Ukrainian port of Sevastopol as headquarters for its Black Sea fleet, and refusing to repair Russian rockets, which can be repaired only there. \nSee also.\nGazprom stops supplying gas to Moldova"}

It has everything to do with practical common sense,\" Mr Newhouse said. \n\"The Pavilion is a heritage-listed building and it will cost thousands of dollars to perform a heritage study and then erect the poles, which don't exist.

They want to reconsider it immediately.\"\nThe Council first voted against installing the flag in March 2005 because of a lengthy and expensive permit process. It is the second time in a year the council has rejected the motion. Mayor of Waverley, Mora Main, says there are already number of Australian flags flying in the Bondi Beach area. She said their primary concern was cost - not just $150 for each flagpole, but more than $15,000 because of the need to do a heritage study and consult the community. \n\"It's an iconic heritage building. Anything that's done to the pavilion needs to go through a rigorous heritage process,\" Cr Main said. \nBefore imposing the ban, the Council recently rejected an offer from Federal MP Malcolm Turnbull to pay for an Australian and Aboriginal flag. \nHowever, Mayor Mora Main says the Council would now have a rethink. \n\"I have called on the Premier and Mr Turnbull to meet with me to discuss the appropriateness of putting flags on the pavilion and also how it can be funded,\" she said. \"It's great to hear this discussion about the flags and I look forward to hearing everyone's ideas when we consult with the community.\" "}

Firefox reduces the vulnerability by asking a user before executing Windows metafiles, but metafiles masquerading as another format will still be executed automatically by the operating system.\nMicrosoft has not yet issued a patch for the vulnerability, prompting Ilfak Guilfanov to release an unofficial patch.

Critics point out that shimgvw.dll could become re-registered by malicious processes or other installations. They also suggest that malicious Windows Metafiles could merely remain \"dormant\" until shimgvw.dll is re-registered.\nThe exploit has been used to attack online forums which allow embedding of image files via &lt;img&gt; tags, prompting some gaming forums to disable &lt;img&gt; tags .

The cost of operating OC Transpo is split between transit fares collected and the tax base (mostly municipal, with some federal and provincial contributions.)\n\"We then continued to talk about waste of fuel, employee pay, insurance liability issues and even went into details about such hot political items as the Kyoto Agreement and conservatism,\" said Patrick. \"Once the driver reached Place d'Orleans the second passenger joined in the conversation. The driver then took a faster alternate route and dropped us off not far from our homes.\"\nAccording to Peter Dickson, editor at The Ottawa Citizen, last year OC Transpo buses followed a 'reduced' Sunday schedule and this created havoc on the system. Peter asked, if \"perhaps this year they where trying to compensate for this inefficiency?\" \nAmalgamated Transit Union (ATU), OC Transpo's union representative has indicated, \"At current fleet levels, Ottawa's roads would be choked with about 40,000 more cars each rush hour if not for OC Transpo.\" ATU suggests 70 per cent of trips in Ottawa are now made by car. However, seemingly, due to returning vacationers and other reasons, today may have created an increase in the use of cars and influenced this statistic. According to city councillor Clive Doucet's web page \"Currently, 17% of all trips residents make in Ottawa are on public transit, up from 15% in the mid-nineties. As a comparison, Paris\u2019 modal split is 40% or higher taking public transit while Los Angeles\u2019 modal split is around 2% for public transit.\" Analysing ridership on a large scale seems to be an important element for the city.\nAccording to Ottawa Mayor Bob Chiarelli, \"We used to be able to plan a transit system for up to 12 years ahead, with assured funding.\" This of course is in reference to provincial government funding.\n\"It would make me happier if we took all of the (fuel taxes) and put them into the transportation infrastructure,\" Mr. Hunt, president of the Canadian Automobile Association says. \"But we don't have a plan.\" \n\"Usually OC Transpo bus drivers have two 4 months bookings, for the fall and the winter and two 2 months booking for the spring and for the summer,\" said Yves Roy. \"For the first time in March 2005, there was a special 1 week booking for the March break that rearranged and redistributed drivers of certain high school bus runs. During previous march breaks, drivers would show up usually waiting 30 or more minutes in an \"idling\" bus.\" \nIs there such thing as to much efficiency? Today is an example of buses and drivers being very efficient. On the other hand, it may be a lack of efficiency within OC Transpo's booking department, upper management and the governments.\nSee also.\n "}

They claim a minor victory against the six-vessel fleet, saying no whales have been killed since Christmas Eve. However they expect a resumption of whaling and protest activity soon.\nGreenpeace has two ships, MV Esperanza and MV Arctic Sunrise, active near Antarctica, in an effort to disrupt the whalers, who intend on slaughtering over 900 Minke whales and 10 Fin whales in the region this summer. The activists aim to stop the Japanese whaling fleet as it tries to catch nearly 1000 whales for what is claimed to be scientific research.\nGreenpeace chief Steve Shallhorn states that the protesters have chased the six-ship fleet northwards, with the vessels now away from the designated whaling zone. Greenpeace plan to maintain their efforts to keep the whalers in the public eye.\n\"What the fleet is doing is trying to outrun Greenpeace so that it can sneak back into the whaling grounds and resume the kill,\" he said. \"And for that very reason, we're doing our very best and are succeeding in keeping up with the factory whaling ship. We are certain that they do not want any further publicity.\"\nHe said Greenpeace will continue its high-speed tailing for as long as it takes. \"We're capable of staying out there for many more weeks,\" he said. \"The [Japanese] fleet is clearly embarrassed by having their actions exposed to the world, since the spotlight on their activities shows what it really is - commercial whaling with a very thin disguise.\"\nThe whalers have been unable to kill any whales since Christmas Eve due to poor weather and harassment by Greenpeace vessels, and the Washington-based Sea Shepherd ship, RV Farley Mowat. The Sea Shepherd is operating independently of Greenpeace but say they are working towards a common objective \u2013 \"the shutting down of illegal whaling in the Southern Ocean.\"\nGreenpeace expedition leader Shane Rattenbury says the whalers have a season of about 100 days. \"Their quota is 945 whales. If you lose, say, 10 per cent of those through bad weather, they've got an average they need to catch of 10 a day and it's gone 10 days now without having any whales,\" he said. \"That starts to add up pretty quickly. They're under a bit of pressure to get on with the business.\"\nJapan's Institute for Cetacean Research have rejected the claims made by Sea Shepherd, that Japanese warship was being sent to Antarctica to protect the fleet against the activists. \nThe Japanese institute spokesman condemned Sea Shepherd over the claim by Farley Mowat captain Paul Watson, who called on the Australian Government to keep the peace. \nSea Shepherd had requested the presence of the Australian navy to monitor events in the Southern Ocean. However, Australia's environment minister, Senator Ian Campbell, said that Sea Shepherd's threats to attack the fleet \"risk setting back the cause of whale conservation many years\".\nCapt Watson said yesterday: \"Stop threatening us, Mr Campbell, and charge us if you believe we are acting unlawfully. Stop posing for the Japanese [who] are in blatant violation of international conservation laws.\"\nJapan's Fisheries Agency, which conducts the whaling, said the claim was a tactic by Sea Shepherd to try to raise the stakes for extra publicity.\n\"This is why the environmentalists' campaign in the Antarctic is a PR stunt: every time they get some media coverage there's always some member not too far away asking the public for money,\" an agency spokesman said in a statement. \"Only this time, it completely backfired and now people will question what these groups say.\"\nThe spokesman had no response to Greenpeace's claim that another vessel had joined the whaling fleet and was refuelling the ships within the boundary of the Antarctic Treaty's nature reserve.\nMr Rattenbury said the 57 activists and crew aboard the Greenpeace ships were in good health following a quiet New Year's Day celebration on deck under a midnight sun.\nHe said his ships were not in contact with the Farley Mowat, which is believed to be closer to the Antarctic ice shelf. The Farley Mowat's weblog quoted ship captain Paul Watson as saying the Sea Shepherd group had no conflict with Greenpeace, despite earlier British media assertions.\n\"As far as I am concerned both Sea Shepherd and Greenpeace are working towards a common objective \u2013 the shutting down of illegal whaling in the Southern Ocean,\" said Paul Watson.\nGreenpeace believes the fleet killed at least 25 whales from the time it contacted the whalers just before Christmas."}

The research then correlated this with the respondent's exposure to advertisement, and the money spent by companies on alcohol ads. The alcohol industry's measured media expenditure is roughly $1.8 billion per year. \nThe study found that those youngsters exposed to more ads also drank more, and that markets with greater alcohol advertising expenditures also had greater alcohol consumption. These findings also oheld for drinking by those younger than the legal drinking age of 21 years. \nAlcohol use by the youth has been a matter of public concern, as it has been linked with lowered educational performance, risky sexual activity, motor accidents and addiction. Other surveys have found that underage drinkers account for 20% of alcohol consumption. Alcohol advertising is not subject to federal legislation, the industry follows a voluntary code of conduct. \nWhile many studies have found an association between alcohol advertising and use, the question of whether the link is a causal one is still unanswered. The present survey uses market-level measures of advertising to address criticism of previous studies that relying on self-reported exposure to advertisements might be biased as those who drink may be more likely to pay attention to, and remember the ads. \nThe study found greater ad-spending in a market was related to both higher levels of youth drinking and steeper increases in drinking over time, which continued until respondents were in their mid-twenties. The link also held the other way: less alcohol advertising associated with less drinking, more modest increases in consumption over time during the respondents' early twenties and a steady decline in consumption after this period. The results are consistent with findings from studies of advertising bans. \nThe study was funded by the National Institute of Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism\nThe industries voluntary guidelines specify that 70 percent of the audience for its advertising be at least 21 years old, the legal drinking age. Industry groups have claimed that its advertising affects only those older than the legal drinking age and that advertising at best causes brand switching. Reacting to the study, representatives of the alcohol industry in the UK, which has one of the highest youth drinking rates in Europe, said that there was a strict system in place controlling advertising. But studies have found that there is often greater concentrations of alcohol advertisements in media aimed at youth than at adults. "}

According to the Bureau of Meteorology, (BOM) 2005 was the hottest year since reliable, widespread temperature observations became available in 1910. Data collected by the Bureau show Australia's annual mean temperature for 2005 was 1.09\u00b0C above the standard 1961-90 average.\nThe Bureau of Meteorology says the result is more evidence of climate change. \nThe Bureau's Blair Trewin said: \"We've seen things like the general retreat of the winter snow line. We've seen a marked decrease in the frequency of frost, especially in inland Queensland,\" Dr Trewin said. \"We've seen an increase in the number of extreme hot days.\"\nAnd the warming trend is likely to continue. \"All the projections we have from climate models we would expect to see continued warming through the 21st century,\" he said. \"Numbers like this ... are another piece of evidence that climate change is real and it's a real issue.\"\nDespite unseasonably cool weather in the South West of Western Australia, 2005 was a hot year over most of the nation, with the Northern Territory (NT) bearing the brunt. The NT area-average maximum temperature was 1.45\u00b0C above the long-term mean, the largest anomaly of any state or territory. \nThe previous record of +0.84\u00b0C was set in 1998. The Bureau says that while these temperature departures may seem relatively small, a 1\u00b0C increase in mean temperatures is equivalent to many southern Australian towns shifting northward by about 100km.\nAll States and Territories, apart from Victoria and Tasmania, recorded 2005 mean temperatures amongst their top two warmest years on record. The only region recording a cooler than normal year was a coastal strip of Western Australia extending from Cape Leeuwin to Carnarvon.\nAustralia's previous warmest years on record were influenced by significant El Ni\u00f1o events, say the Bureau. However, no such event occurred in 2005, making the record warmth even more unusual. Since 1979, all but four years have been warmer than average in Australia.\nAustralian temperatures have increased by approximately 0.9\u00baC since 1910 - consistent with global warming trends. Scientific studies have linked global and Australian temperature increases to the enhanced greenhouse effect. \nThe early months of 2005 were also very dry over much of Australia with the January-May period being the 2nd driest on record. Australia's area-averaged rainfall is calculated from a network of around 5000 rainfall stations. Observations from this network reveal that, when compared to historical records, Tasmania was the wettest State in 2005, while Queensland and Western Australia were the driest. \nOver the New Year bushfires have caused havoc in many parts of Australia, with houses, farm stock devastated. Thousands of hectares of bushland and farmland have been burnt out.\nEnvironmentalists say the weather is a precursor of things to come: \"2005 gave us a little taste of what life will be like if we fail to tackle climate change,\" Greenpeace's Catherine Fitzpatrick said. \"The extreme heat and bushfires of New Year's Day 2006 showed that it isn't going to be fun. If action isn't taken soon to avoid catastrophic climate change, Australians will have John Howard to blame for failing to act when he had the chance.\"\nMs Fitzpatrick said the Federal Government was as beholden to the coal and aluminium industries as the Japanese government was to whaling companies, and with far more devastating impacts. \"Today's figures should spur our Environment Minister ... to real action \u2013 ratify Kyoto, quit coal and move towards clean, renewable energy,\" Ms Fitzpatrick said.\nThe Howard government claims it is taking appropriate action. Federal Environment Minister Ian Campbell said he recognised climate change was the biggest modern-day environmental challenge. \"I think that climate change is alarming,\" he said on ABC radio. \"I regard climate change as the number one environmental challenge ... It is a huge and serious challenge. These figures add to the weight of evidence that climate change is real and it's a problem that the world needs to work together to seek to solve.\"\nAustralia and the United States are the only developed nations to have refused to sign the Kyoto Protocol, which calls on countries to cut greenhouse emissions by 5.2 per cent below 1990 levels by 2012.\nThe Government argues Kyoto will not work because it does not commit developing nations to reducing emissions. \"Kyoto excludes most of the emissions in the world. It only covers just over a third of the countries of the world and ... we need something that includes all countries of the world,\" said Senator Campbell.\nMany regions across the globe also reported an exceptionally warm year. According to a preliminary estimate released by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), the global mean temperature for 2005 was about 0.48\u00b0C above normal, putting 2005 amongst the four warmest years globally since records commenced in 1861.

Hatfield blamed the reversal on \"bad information\" and \"miscommunication.\" \n\"What happened is that through stray cell phone conversations it appears that this miscommunication from the rescue team underground to the command center was picked up by various people that simply overheard the conversation that was relayed over cell phone communications without our ever having made a [public news] release,\" explained Hatfield.\nFamily members walked out of the church saying that the CEO of the mining company had \"lied to them\". The surviving miner, Randal McCloy, is currently in critical condition at Ruby Memorial Hospital in Morgantown, West Virginia.\nThe United States Mine Safety and Health Administration issued the mine 208 citations last year, an increase from 68 reported in 2004. Federal regulations cover concerns over accumulations of combustible materials, including methane gas and coal dust from loose coal, in addition to other safety issues. The agency has announced that it plans launch a in-depth investigation into the incident at Sago. The investigation will examine the mine's compliance with health and safety standards and how emergency information was communicated."}

Wildfires in 29 of the state\u2019s 77 counties have claimed more than 360,000 acres. Meanwhile, officials in Texas say 238 homes and 254,555 acres have been lost to wildfires in that state since Dec. 26.\nUnseasonably warm weather and wind gusts of up to 40 mph have combined to make an already dangerous situation worse across the Southern Plains, which also include parts of Kansas, Colorado and New Mexico, said Jason Levit of the National Storm Prediction Center in Norman.\n\u201cThe region also continues to remain in a severe to extreme drought situation,\u201d Levit said. \u201cDry surface vegetation will continue to serve as an excellent fuel for any fires that develop.\u201d\nSome dry areas, such as the Rocky Mountains and Great Lakes, may soon see some much-needed rain. Levit says the already fire-ravaged Southern Plains will have no such luck, however, and people should be aware of the severe danger that will continue to threaten the region.\nIn Oklahoma, state authorities and the National Guard have established a command post in Shawnee, about 40 miles east of Oklahoma City, where they have been joined by officials from the U.S. Forest Service, the Bureau of Indian Affairs, and the National Weather Service.\nThe state was granted access to relief from the Federal Emergency Management Agency on Dec. 28, said Gov. Brad Henry. The Governor requested fire management grants to help cover expenses related to the wildfires that began the previous day. FEMA\u2019s approval means funds are now available to local governments and volunteer fire departments that responded to the blazes in Hughes and Seminole counties. Requests involving nine other counties were approved in the days that followed.\nFires hit the northeastern part of Oklahoma City, the state\u2019s capital and largest city, on Sunday. Fires were said to have destroyed 20 homes over the weekend.\nA National Guard helicopter and firefighters from North Carolina were sent to battle a blaze near the town of Davis, in south-central Oklahoma, on Tuesday. Meanwhile, the BIA sent two airplanes to help fight a fire near Eufaula, in eastern Oklahoma. Three other BIA aircraft aided crews fighting fires near Wewoka, in central Oklahoma, and additional fires were reported near Knowles, Oklahoma City, Ponca City and Tishmingo.\nAuthorities said additional National Guard helicopters and Forest Service planes are available to battle other fires as they break out.\nIn addition to teams from North Carolina, other firefighters from Alabama, Florida, and Tennessee have arrived and are being stationed throughout the state.\nThe Oklahoma State Medical Examiner\u2019s Office said one man has died from injuries sustained from recent wildfires. A 68-year-old Hughes County man died Dec. 28 from thermal burns and smoke inhalation. The death is in addition to that of a 68-year-old Carter County woman who died last month while trying to use a garden hose to save her home from being consumed by flames.\nThe governor\u2019s office said the state continues to await word on a request for a federal disaster declaration made Friday. A disaster declaration by President George W. Bush would qualify Oklahoma for federal funds to place firefighters ahead of where blazes are burning, and would provide temporary housing assistance and low-interest loans for those whose homes or businesses have been destroyed.\nTexas authorities say they have 92 aircraft and 650 state workers working to fight fires, and have been joined by crews from Alabama, Florida, Louisiana, Tennessee, and Wisconsin. The U.S. Forest Service is also helping the state to handle the emergency.\nDespite efforts, wildfires on Monday claimed nearly the entire town of Ringgold, destroying 45 buildings that comprised about 80 percent of the town."}

One of the most significant aspects of the raid was that it provided arms for the insurgency movement. According to the government of Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, the movement is home-grown and does not include foreign fighters. This significant supply of arms and ammunition has allowed a considerable number of attacks such as drive-by shootings, and efforts to recover the stolen weapons have had minimal success with only ten or less of the guns reportedly recovered.\nDespite the majority of casualties having been caused by the insurgents, inexperience in handling a modern guerilla campaign have seen actions of Thai security forces the cause of casualties, most notable being the Tak Bai incident where 78 men died in custody.

In a ringing defense of the warrantless eavesdropping authorized by President Bush, Cheney said he had \"personally presided\" over most briefings of selected Capitol Hill lawmakers about the program, which was begun in response to the 9/11 attacks and after Congress passed a September 2001 resolution authorizing the use of force to combat terrorism.\nThe National Security Agency (NSA) has been monitoring certain domestic telephone calls and emails, under the condition that the other end of the message is to or from a foreign location, the White House has admitted. In addition, the \"New York Times\" has reported that the agency has been conducting a widespread data-mining operation of such messages, hoping to identify patterns that might tip off the U.S. government to terrorist operations. Bush quickly backed up the decision by Michael Hayden, then NSA chief and now deputy national intelligence director, repeatedly authorizing the NSA to conduct warrantless searches, according to published reports.\nCheney vigorously defended the program, arguing that it could have prevented the 9/11 attacks, though a \"Washington Post\" report of his speech notes flaws in his reasoning. Cheney avoided mention of words such as \"warrantless\" and gave no explanation of why the secretive Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act court, which normally issues national security warrants, needed to be bypassed. He asserted however that \"the civil liberties of the American people are unimpeded\" by the \"wartime measure.\"\nCheney may face pressure by some in Congress, such as Republican Senator Arlen Specter, who has pledged to investigate the eavesdropping program, to testify on Capitol Hill, though Cheney is known to be a major proponent of executive privilege and may well resist.\nThe vice president, anticipating a \"spirited debate\" on the necessity of the program, said the leak of \"highly classified\" data to the \"NYTimes\" had been a \"clear detriment to our national security.\"\nThe Justice Department launched a probe last week to seek the source of leaked information about the secretive program. No report has emerged that the Justice Department is making a formal inquiry into possible illegalities that might have occurred on the part of the NSA or White House. Many in Congress are interested in this point, as some see this surveillance of U.S. citizens as a violation of their Fourth Amendment right guarding against unreasonable searches.\nThe Justice Department head and former White House counsel, Alberto Gonzales, has defended the NSA program as legal and constitutional."}

{"id": "29986", "revid": "39076", "url": "https://en.wikinews.org/wiki?curid=29986", "title": "Bloggers investigate social networking websites", "text": "The humble beginnings of many popular Web services, such as Google, LiveJournal, and Yahoo!, are well-documented and available on their websites, and frequently recounted in news stories about the firms. These websites are also scrutinized for any perceived violations of users' privacy or other basic rights.\nHowever, until recently, no investigation had been done into MySpace and Facebook, two new \"social networking\" sites of explosive popularity among teenagers and college students. American bloggers, using Google and financial records, have begun investigations into the origins and policies of these sites, making some claims that the site owners explicitly deny.\nFacebook.\nFacebook was founded by Mark Zuckerberg, an individual web developer looking to make friends at Harvard University. Although Facebook has been sued by ConnectU.com for allegedly copying its concept and data, Facebook is actually the first worldwide college network on the Internet. As one of the most popular college websites, Facebook is notable for its lack of prominent advertising. It quickly accumulated $50,000 in debt in 2004, and it took nearly a year for it to begin turning a profit, so clearly it needed a large amount of venture capital.\nIn August 2005, independent blogger Josh Smith theorized that Facebook could actually be a data-gathering operation. He determined that Facebook received its initial funding from Peter Thiel, which he named as co-author of the book \"The Diversity Myth\", which argues that \"multiculturalism\" is used to promote social intolerance on American college campuses. Smith also found that Facebook also received $13 million in funding from \"Accel Partners\", a firm whose manager James Breyer formerly served as the chairman of In-Q-Tel, a venture capital firm operated by the United States Central Intelligence Agency.\nHowever, both Accel Partners and Peter Thiel have invested in many dot-com companies. Peter Thiel is the co-founder of PayPal, and James Breyer has done extensive work in Silicon Valley. Investigating a firm's sources of venture capital has not often led to breakthrough exposes in the past.\nMore importantly, Smith discovered clauses in Facebook's current Privacy Policy which state that they \"may share your information with third parties, including responsible companies with which we have a relationship\". The Privacy Policy also warns that \"Facebook also collects information about you from other sources, such as newspapers and instant messaging services. This information is gathered regardless of your use of the Web Site.\" Other bloggers have also called attention to this ambiguous statement, which seems to point towards a Facebook conspiracy theory. User \"timg\" at the Reddit news website noted that \"these sites provide possibly the most accurate and easiest to use resource for mining information about groups of people.\"\nAccording to Chris Hughes, spokesperson for Facebook,\nThe main issue surrounding Facebook is one of trust. Privacy advocates on the Web are always wary of any website that asks for detailed personal information, and Facebook takes this to the extreme by displaying entire social networks. However, most Facebook users seem to trust it deeply, providing full friends lists, phone numbers, and personal photo albums.\nMySpace.\nTrent Lapinski, another blogger, began an investigation into MySpace in July 2005, when it was acquired by Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation, parent company of FOX News. MySpace does not often receive criticism about privacy issues, as its users typically do not give out last names or other personal information, but its company history is more interesting. Lapinski was threatened with a lawsuit by MySpace's legal team when he let them know about his investigation, but on January 4, he decided to come forward with the details anyway.\nMySpace expressed interest in commenting on this Wikinews article but did not respond by press time.\nMySpace's CEO Chris DeWolfe and its most prominent spokesperson Tom Anderson first met in 1999 at Xdrive Technologies, a dot-com startup which gave away free storage space to Internet users. DeWolfe and Anderson went on to work together at ResponseBase, LLC., which was acquired by eUniverse, Inc., which later became Intermix Media. The relationship between these three companies is tangled indeed, and involves the MySpace name itself.\nAccording to Chris DeWolfe, \"the general MySpace site\" was launched in September 2003. Tom Anderson claims that \"MySpace was a creative idea before it was a business.\" However, long before MySpace became a social networking website, the name MySpace and the domain myspace.com had been used by ResponseBase for their profitable newsletter about \"Freebies, Deals, &amp; Discounts\", and a free disk space host similar to Xdrive. Newsgroup archives show multiple messages linking to copyrighted files hosted on MySpace. In 2001, MySpace's spokesperson was quoted in an article about \"warez\". The Internet Archive has backups of MySpace.com going back to 1999, but these cannot be accessed because MySpace's current owners have blocked the Internet Archive specifically from accessing the site.\nOne newsgroup message from 2001 documents the transition from MySpace to ResponseBase:\nActually, MySpace had simply shut down and become ResponseBase-- as evidenced by the \"Freebies\" newsletter above. ResponseBase also used a list of 8 million e-mail addresses purchased from Xdrive for their newsletters. In 2002, ResponseBase was booted from their ISP as an illicit spam organization-- with Tom Anderson himself listed as their billing contact. And later still, ResponseBase would be renamed to MySpace.\nIn 2002, DeWolfe went on to become a director of \"Fog Cutter Capital Group\", whose CEO, Andrew Wiederhorn, was convicted of income tax and pension felonies and sentenced to prison. Fog Cutter continued to pay Wiederhorn a salary of $350,000 per month for 18 months while he sat in jail. Wiederhorn's wife, Tiffany Wiederhorn, is on the board of directors at MySpace's parent company Intermix Media.\nIntermix Media itself has a tangled history. In 2004, Intermix (then operating as eUniverse) was named as a spammer organization on USENET. It purchased ResponseBase, shut down its operations, and reformed it as MySpace. On April 28, 2005, Intermix was sued by the State of New York for installing malicious spyware over the Internet. According to their press release:\nJust before the adware investigation was announced, Intermix's primary investors sold $25,000,000 worth of Intermix stock at roughly $8 per share. When the attorney general announced the investigation, Intermix stock fell to $4 per share. Intermix's former CEO, Brad Greenspan, has accused Intermix investors of insider trading.\nSoon afterwards, the spyware issue was settled out of court; Intermix paid $7.5 million to the State of New York.\nAccording to \"The Economist\", \"As an internet business, MySpace.com considers itself to be an entirely new breed ... The community has grown virally, with no advertising.\" However, this leaves one crucial question unanswered: without advertising, how did the site become popular in the first place?"}

This is not Stewart's first time hosting an awards show as he hosted the Grammys in 2001 and 2002.\nHis choice by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences shows their continuing attempt to target a younger viewing audience. Last year's host was Chris Rock, also a comedian who is popular with young adults, whose performance and jokes at the expense of celebrities irked some Academy members. The Academy has also been seeking an Oscar host with the appeal of popular hosts such as Billy Crystal, Johnny Carson, and Bob Hope.\nThe choice further demonstrates Stewart's transformation from the host of a cult TV show into a mainstream performer. Stewart is host of \"The Daily Show\", a satirical show aired on Comedy Central that parodies network and cable news shows. The show started in 1996, anchored by Stewart's predecessor Craig Kilborn, who left in 1999 to host \"The Late Late Show with Craig Kilborn\". \"The Daily Show\" draws in about 1.4 million viewers nightly. While not a groundbreaking number, sixty-five percent of those viewers are in the 18 to 49 age group, which is the group most coveted by television advertisers.\n\"The Daily Show\" has become influental in politics and pop culture. Stewart has interviewed many guests from both sides of the political spectrum, including 2004 presidential candidate John Kerry, Bill O'Reilly, Bill Clinton, Jimmy Carter, and has asked for President George W. Bush to come on the show, going so far as publish an invitation in a full page newspaper ad during the 2004 Republican National Convention.\nStewart has interviewed celebrities like Bruce Willis, Ice Cube, The Rock, and recently interviewed the band The White Stripes who then did a live studio performance. \nAlthough \"The Daily Show\" is steeped in satire, its emphasis on political coverage and current events has led to many of its younger viewers regard it as their daily news source, especially during the 2004 presidential election. Stewart was even considered as a possible replacement for Dan Rather on the \"CBS Evening News\" by CBS executive Leslie Moonves, which owned Comedy Central before splitting into two companies just a few days ago.\nAlthough a comedian, Stewart can be serious at times. Notable was his appearance on the CNN show \"Crossfire\" in which he got into a debate with host Tucker Carlson over the state of television journalism. He accused \"Crossfire\" of polarizing politics and that it was hurting America, saying \"It's not so much that it's bad, as it's hurting America [...] Stop, stop, stop, stop hurting America.\" He referred to Carlson and co-host Paul Begala as \"partisan hacks\", and said that Carlson was \"as big a dick on [his] show as [he is] on any show\". Many believe this highly publicized criticizm led to the cancellation of \"Crossfire\".\n\"The Daily Show\" has won seven Emmys and a Peabody Award for their coverage of the 2000 presidential election.\nThe Academy Awards ceremony will be held on ABC this year on March 5th."}

In comparison, the largest traditional English-language encyclopedia, \"Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica\", has 120,000 articles. This milestone marks an important point in Wikipedia's short history.\nThere was minor confusion over the millionth article; it was first held to be Jordanhill Railway Station, then a brief biography of baseball player Aaron Ledesma. The millionth article was later confirmed to be the former, started by Wikipedia contributor Nach0king (Ewan Macdonald). \"While I am, of course, delighted at being the one to hit this milestone, I must confess, along with many others I timed my contributions tonight to give me a chance at being the lucky one,\" he wrote on his Wikipedia user page.\nJimmy Wales commented that \"We are thrilled that our millionth article in English is about the Jordanhill railway station. This is not something which would appear in a traditional encyclopedia, and it shows how Wikipedia reflects the needs and interests of people everywhere, and not just the dictates of what academics and cultural mavens claim is worthy of an encyclopedia.\"\nCelebrations.\nThe milestone was celebrated by a party on the Freenode IRC network, where Wikimedia's official IRC channels can be found. The milestone was preceded by an announcement to all 30,000 Freenode users, that a separate channel, #wikipedia-countdown, was being set aside for a celebration. In that channel, an IRC script, ran by Wikipedian ems, called off the article numbers as they passed by. A total of 733 different people joined the channel over the course of the afternoon. The tension was high when the millionth article was reached; in the first 40 seconds afterwards, chatting was briefly enabled in the channel, and over 3,000 lines of celebratory chat filled the room; chatting had to be disabled until everyone had calmed down.\nAbout Wikipedia.\nWikipedia was founded in 2001 by Jimmy Wales, the CEO and co-founder of Bomis, Inc., and Larry Sanger, an employee of Bomis. Wikipedia began as a complementary project to Nupedia, which was created by Wales to be a free internet encyclopedia. Nupedia was open like Wikipedia but had a much more complex editing system. One day, Sanger made a proposal on the Nupedia mailing list exploring the possibility of a Wiki-based encyclopedia. Out of this proposal, Wikipedia was born. Sanger was appointed editor-in-chief of Wikipedia by Wales, and the project was underwritten by Bomis. Nupedia was eventually scrapped.\nWikipedia has grown immensely in five short years and is no longer under the control of Bomis. The success of Wikipedia and some of the earlier sister projects lead Wales to create a non-profit organization to run them, called the Wikimedia Foundation. Wikipedia has a user base of around one million registered users and contains over three million pages altogether. It has become one of the world's top 25 websites, as ranked by Alexa Internet, and has come to the attention of the media worldwide.\nA source of negative publicity for Wikipedia in November 2005 was the John Seigenthaler Sr. controversy, in which a then-unknown vandal created a biographical article about Seigenthaler on Wikipedia that contained numerous false and defamatory statements. This article went unnoticed for several months until it was discovered by Victor S. Johnson, Jr., a friend of Seigenthaler's, who brought it to his attention. Another friend corrected the erroneous information. Seigenthaler contacted Wales about the problem and later wrote an op-ed column for \"USA Today\" about the incident, which led to much unfavorable coverage of Wikipedia. However Wikipedia also experienced some of its strongest growth in usage shortly after his op-ed.\nIn December 2005, a more positive story about Wikipedia appeared in Nature magazine, describing a study that reported Wikipedia's science articles to be slightly less accurate as those in the Encyclopaedia Britannica. \nSince many Wikipedia pages are not articles, the number of articles in Wikipedia depends on how an article is defined. To be counted as an article, a Wikipedia page must be in the article namespace and contain at least one internal link. This definition will include some stub articles. The number of articles would be about 8% smaller under the alternative definition that an article must also contain at least 200 characters of text.\nThe next largest Wikipedia is the German version, which contains over 350,000 articles. Currently there are Wikipedias in 125 different languages, containing 3.3 million articles in total."}

When my innocence is proven, I hope America will realize the injustice of the death penalty as all other civilized countries have,\" as his final words before being strapped into the electric chair. \nGovernor Warner said regarding the Coleman case, \"[that] technology has advanced significantly and can be applied in the case of someone who consistently maintained his innocence until execution\u2026 My prayers are with the family of Wanda McCoy as we take this extraordinary step.\" Coleman's resolute insistence on his innocence drew national attention when he was pictured on the cover of \"TIME\" magazine, focusing attention on capital punishment.\nThe victim was a 19-year-old housewife and Coleman\u2019s sister-in-law. DNA work done on sperm evidence during the 1990\u2019s found that Coleman was within 2% of the possible population of people who could have committed the crime. Coleman\u2019s execution was allowed to proceed by then governor Douglas Wilder.\nThe biological evidence used during Coleman's post-conviction appeal process has been under negotiation for months to agree on a proper method to have it re-tested. Four Virginia newspapers and the Centurion Ministries, a New Jersey organization, asked for the re-testing. The request was denied by the Virginia Supreme Court. With negotiations over the biological evidence successfully concluded, and with a new appeal from the Centurion Ministries to Governor Warner, the testing has begun and may conclude before the end of Warner\u2019s governorship on January 14.\nThe sperm has been kept frozen at a California laboratory for 15 years. Dr. Blake, the head of the lab, submitted an affidavit attesting to the integrity of the samples. The first set of samples was sent to the Ontario Centre of Forensic Sciences lab in Toronto on December 15. A second delivery currently is underway.\n\"We have found that the latest DNA technology\u2014in certain instances where the other facts of a case support it\u2014has provided a definitive result not available at the time of trial or post-conviction testing,\" said Governor Warner.

Robertson made the comments on his show, \"The 700 Club\", which is produced by Robertson's Christian Broadcasting Network.\n\"God considers this land [Israel] to be His. When you read the Bible, He said 'This is my land.' For any Prime Minister of Israel who decides he will carve it up and give it away, God said, 'No, this is Mine,'\" said Robertson. \"I would say woe to any prime minister of Israel who takes a similar course to appease the EU, the United Nations, or the United States of America.\"\nRobertson tempered his comments, adding that Sharon is \"a very tender-hearted man and a good friend\" and that he has prayed alongside the former prime minister. A spokesperson for Robertson said he \"expresses his deep sadness over Ariel Sharon\u2019s life threatening stroke and concern for Israel\u2019s future security.\"\nReverend Barry W. Lynn, director of Americans United for Separation of Church and State didn't agree with Robertson's comment.\n\"[A religious leader] should not be making callous political points while a man is struggling for his life,\" said Lynn. \"Pat Robertson has a political agenda for the entire world, and he seems to think God is ready to take out any world leader who stands in the way of that agenda.\"\nThe White House immediately distanced itself from Robertson's comments.\n\"Those comments are wholly inappropriate and offensive and really don't have a place in this or any other debate,\" said Deputy Press Secretary Trent Duffy during a media gaggle aboard Air Force One.\nAngell Watts, a spokesperson for Robertson, who is an ordained minister and bible teacher, said that \"Robertson is simply reminding his viewers what the Bible has to say about efforts made to divide the land of Israel.\"\nThis isn't the first time Robertson has created rifts among conservatives. In late 2005, he called for the assassination of Venezuelan President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez. Since this incident, ABC Family, which airs \"The 700 Club\" because of a contractual clause, due to the fact the network was part of Robertson's media empire at one time; has began airing a disclaimer before, during and after the program stating, \"The views and opinions expressed by \"The 700 Club\" and CBN do not reflect the views of ABC Family.\" He also has made charged comments regarding the residents of Dover, Pennsylvania after a proposal to teach intelligent design in public schools was defeated.\nRobertson says he is a Southern Baptist. He is also a former nominee for the Republican party presidential candidate in 1988."}

The fisherman were found in possession of nearly two tonnes of trochus shell, a shell valued for fashioning into high quality buttons, beads and trinkets. They face jail terms up to a year.\nThe WA Fisheries Department says the jail terms reflect the seriousness with which the offence is being viewed. Department officer Chris Mitchell says the fishermen had traversed 200 miles of Commonwealth waters and were inside the three nautical mile state limit when they were caught.\nHe says their actions are a serious breach of fisheries laws. \"In the early days, the courts would have given a good behaviour bond for a first offender,\" he said. \"That was more specifically for the traditional sail-powered vessels, not these motorised vessels that are coming down and because these are in state waters it is far more serious.\"\nOn Thursday, skippers of 11 Indonesian fishing boats were fined by a Perth court. Three of the men, who had previous convictions, were fined $15,000 each, with 100 days to pay. The remaining eight were fined $9000 each and given 60 days to pay. \nThe captains were fined between $9,000 and $15,000 for fishing and taking trochus shell from Australian waters off the north-west coast last month. Three of the captains have been caught fishing in Australian waters before between 1997 and 2004.\nLegal Aid lawyer David McKenzie, says the fishermen were very poor and it was highly unlikely they would be able to pay the fines. \nThe magistrate ordered that they spend between 60 and 100 days in jail in Western Australia if the fines were not paid.

War in parts of the region is an extra exacerbating factor.\nThe countries need immediate food, water, seeds and any other agricultural product, according to the Rome-based Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), which reports that millions of people are on the brink of starvation due to the recent severe droughts that have been devastating the area.\n\"The whole area is affected,\" FAO representative Shukri Ahmed said. \"The situation is deteriorating.\" Local newspaper reports gave an official death toll at 30 famine-related deaths, said Mr Ahmed.\nMany had not expected that the area's dry season would be as severe as it has been, and did not anticipate the effects.\nOthers, such as Yves Engler, expect famines and massive starvation to continue in the region as long as the IMF continues to influence economic policies in the region. Yves Engler has claimed, consistently with Amartya Sen's analysis, that the IMF is responsible for worsening or actually creating famine in Malawi (2002), Ethiopia (2003) and Niger (2005).\nThe present drought has been said to be getting worse by the day, and the total figure for those who need food from the World Food Program could rise from today's 1.2 million, to exceed 2.5 million people, according to United Nations (UN) spokesman Stephane Dujarric at the organisation's New York headquarters.\nThe FAO had called for domestic food purchases in areas where harvests were expected to be favorable, coupled with food aid imports elsewhere, the UN's Mr Dujarric said.\nCrops have failed, and local attempts at distributing supplies have been blamed on poor infrastructure and a lack of supplies. What makes the region's situation even more grave, is that the rainy season failed to aid in the production of much needed crops.\nNearly one-fifth of the population of Djibouti were said to be facing food shortages and wide-spread starvation. Nearly $40 million is said to be needed to offset the famine. 64,000 tons of food are needed by the World Food Program, but only 16,700 were known to be available. \nThe World Food program was trying to assess the worst hit areas.

She was carried to shore by friends and was then flown by rescue helicopter to the Princess Alexandra Hospital in Brisbane. Surgeons were unable to save her.\nThe woman was holidaying from Brisbane with a church camp and attempts to contact her family have been made.\nEmergency Services Rescue Helicopter crew officer Rod Morgan said the woman had suffered massive blood loss. \n\"She was very pale\" he said, \"We were diverted right away and were able to be on the scene within minutes and were able to have the patient at hospital within an hour of the attack.\"\n\"She had life threatening injuries she had lost significant amounts of blood and the patient had what we would call an altered level of consciousness where it wasn't able to communicate directly with the patient\" said Queensland Ambulance paramedic Lachlan Parker. \nThere were many witnesses at the scene and they are now being interviewed by Police at Amity Point.

It was just a little black-and-white dog but he was crazy so I locked him under the house.\"\nOther reports claim that the woman had been scuba diving in murky shallow water approximately 15 metres from the shore.\nThe woman is believed to be from McDowall in Brisbane, but her name has not yet been released.\nA resident of Amity Point for 20 years, Brad Ross, said tourists visiting the area have been warned of potential attacks; \"The shore just falls away into 30m of water and there are plenty of bull sharks out there. People know when they enter the water there they're stepping into a shark habitat.\" \nOther beaches on the island are protected by drum lines.\nQueensland state police inspector Peter Harding believes from the severity of the woman's injuries that she was attacked by a group of bull sharks, a species known for aggressive behavior this time of year. Water police will search for the sharks today and as a result, beaches on the east and west of Amity Point have been closed.\nThis is the first attack in the area since August 1972.\nLocal wisdom cautions against allowing dogs in the water at swimming beaches, because of a fear that they attract sharks, perhaps because of residue accumulated from fleas which live on the dog's blood.\nExternal links.\n "}

The two declined to fight extradition to Virginia and were flown into the Richmond International Airport Monday afternoon.\nPolice believe the total of seven victims from two different crime scenes were linked, as both groups were bound with duct tape prior to their being brutally murdered. The suspects, both 28-year-olds, are Ray Joseph Dandridge and Ricky Gevon \"Cooley\" Gray.\nThe initial incident took place on New Year's day when all four members of the Harvey family were discovered in their basement bound by tape and with their throats slit. Johnny Hott, a family friend, had discovered a fire at the Harvey's home as he arrived for a 2pm family and friends chili party gathering to ring in the new year that Sunday. Emergency crews responded to a 911 call and put out the fire, which at that point had only caused moderate damage, and then discovered Bryan Harvey, 49, his wife Kathryn, 39, and their two children Stella, 9, and Ruby, 4. Harvey was a musician who achieved some airplay while in the 1980s duo House of Freaks, and his wife was a well-known Richmond toy store owner who also happened to be the half sister of Steven Culp who played Rex Van De Kamp on Desperate Housewives. \nPolice initially believed the Harvey family murders were committed by someone close to the family. But as later events unfolded in nearby Chesterfield County, a more random picture emerged. \nA witness reported that a white van was parked outside the Harvey residence where a woman identified as 21-year-old Ashley Baskerville was said to be inside it at the time of the murders. \nThen two days later, on Tuesday at the Goolsby residence, a relative speaking for the shaken victims of a separate home-invasion robbery said that the Baskerville woman was with two men who forced their way into the home and robbed them of a computer, television, DVD player and money.\nUltimately, Ashley Baskerville was found dead on Friday, bound with duct tape and murdered at her parent\u2019s residence along with her mother Mary Tucker, 47 and step-father Percyell Tucker, 55. That residence is located no more than 3 miles from the Harvey residence.\nThe white van believed to have been the one spotted in front of the Harvey residence was recovered at the Tucker home. A green Chevrolet Blazer was taken by Dandridge and Gray to travel to west Philadelphia where they arrived some time on Friday afternoon at the home of Dandridge's father. The two were arrested there by a SWAT team.\nPolice are also interested in any possible connection the two might have with the murder of Gray\u2019s wife. The body of Treva Gray was found on November 5 southwest of Pittsburgh, in the town of Washington, Pennsylvania. Her murder occurred less than two weeks after Dandridge's release of from prison. \nDandridge was released from James River Correctional Center November 2005 after serving a ten year prison sentence for robbery. Gray is Dandridge's uncle, and believed to be from Arlington, in Northern Virginia."}

To this, Revver co-founder Oliver Luckett responded, \"References to his service were banned because MySpace saw it as competition\".\nOverall, the blocking of video stored on YouTube and other sites or embedded in user profiles has led to accusations of censorship from MySpace members.

Sarnia's Chad Painchaud and the Spirit's Michal Birner were the first to shoot. Neither scored. On their next shot, the Sting took a 1-0 shoouout lead on Tomas Pospisil's goal. The Spirit would respond as captain Patrick McNeill would score on the very next shot. Shooting next for the Sting, Harrison Reed did not score and neither did Zack Torquato for the Spirit. According to OHL rules, the game then proceeded into sudden death. The Sting shot first. Ryan McInerny's shot was saved by Ryan Daniels. The Spirit sent Ryan McDonough to attempt to win the game. His shot was also blocked by Parker Van Buskirk. Sarnia's next shot was off the stick of Jamie Fraser. It was blocked. The Spirit then sent out Jesse Gimblett, brother of Tyson, to take the Spirit's next shot. His goal won the game for the Spirit at 9:45 pm in front of a sold out crowd of 4,312.\nThe OHL Three Stars of the Game were Saginaw's Jesse Gimblett with no points, but the winning goal in the shootout, and Patrick McNeill with 1 goal and two assists and Sarnia's Chad Painchaud with 2 goals and 2 assists."}

Other hostages remain inside, authorities say. Police later shot and killed one bank robber and arrested a second on after a 10 hour stand-off with police. \"A sniper shot the male suspect while the female was in custody\", said Osceola County Sheriff Bob Hansell. Four hostages were not injured.\nThe suspects had escaped the Mercantile Bank, a mile west of Walt Disney World's Wide World of Sports, with one hostage after authorities blasted through the rear door using an explosive device. But police soon cornered them in their getaway car, authorities said. The male suspect then \"used the hostage again as a shield to get into another vehicle,\" Hansell said. \"He tried to leave again and at that point he was taken down by one of our snipers.\"\nDeputies had been using cell phones to negotiate with the suspects, who were wearing masks, wigs and coats.\nAround 7:15 p.m. EST, police blasted through the bank's rear door. The suspects escaped with a female hostage and drove away in a bank employee's car, but they traveled less than a mile before street barricades stopped them. Shots were fired at deputies but nobody was hurt, police said. \nThe suspects had been holed up in the bank since Tuesday morning. The first hostage was released when the robbers panicked when deputies arrived so quickly after the robbery, said sheriff's spokeswoman Twis Lizasuain. The second was freed in exchange for cigarettes and the third after deputies agreed to back their vehicles a few feet farther away from the bank, Lizasuain said.\nPolice did not release the names the hostages, but the suspects were identified Wednesday as a 50-year-old male, Gaetano Alessandrello, and a 26-year old woman, Amanda Lynn Moeller. It was not immediately clear whether the suspects ever got any money. Tourists near the bank, in hotels, were confined to them for hours as police asked them \"to stay indoors\".\nThe hostages said they were treated well and were not threatened with violence, Hansell said.\nThe same bank was robbed just 2 months ago on November 16, 2005. It is unclear if the two robberies are connected or not. "}

The Wikimedia project includes Wikinews as well as other popular sites such as Wikipedia.\nFirst instituted on October 19, this is the third such block in China, upsetting students and researchers who say that it is having a significant impact on their ability to conduct research, and even pass civil service exams. It is unclear why they are using Wikipedia as a sole source for research in the first place.\nThere is little indication of whether the block is temporary or permanent. As with all Internet blocks instituted by the PRC, government agencies have not commented. Wikimedia has been blocked twice in the past and Wikipedia users have speculated that the two previous blocks, both in 2004, were due to articles on banned subjects \u2013 such as Taiwanese independence and the Tiananmen Square Protests of 1989. \nMany users in China have been using proxy servers and other means to circumvent the block. Hopes that the block would be quickly lifted, like the previous two times, faded as weeks turned into months. \nOn October 21st, a prominent Chinese Wikipedia administrator posted, \"If nothing goes wrong, the block should be lifted within one week.\" He followed up on the 24th by saying, \"The block will be lifted by Wednesday [October 26]. According to procedure (the details of which are unknown), after the appeal is submitted, a reply will come within 3 business days, and my appeal has already been submitted by the ISP on Friday. My ISP has said that so far they haven't encountered a case where an appeal has failed. This should be good news, but it's still impossible to know the reason for the block.\" Since then, there has been no reported response from government agencies.\nDuring the first block in 2004, users of the project petitioned their ISPs, one of which is thought to have had a role in restoring access. The second block, slightly later in the year, was only temporary, lasting four days. \nThe Chinese government has an active policy of blocking websites they consider harmful. Sites that have been blocked include foreign news sites (BBC News as an example), information about Tibetan independence, the Falun Gong and some websites based in Taiwan.\nWikimedia Foundation maintains a group of non-profit websites dedicated to open content information that any user can edit.

While the constitutional amendments allowing such an action were adopted Jan. 1, Yushchenko and Yekhanurov claim that only the parliament set to be elected in March will have such an ability.\nHowever, there are some that believe that the parliament's move was more about gaining \"political leverage\" than responding to the gas crisis, reported the Los Angeles Times.\nYushchenko also accused Ukraine's parliament on Wednesday of \"destabilizing the country by sacking his government,\" a move which sent the local currency plumitting to its lowest point in nearly nine months.\nYushchenko met Vladimir Putin for the first time since the Russian president ordered gas taps to be turned off to his ex-Soviet neighbor at the new year in a bitter dispute over prices that briefly disrupted supplies to the rest of Europe.\nLast week Moscow agreed to a new contract, which Ukraine would pay nearly two times the amount it did before.

Its journey will have lasted a total of just over seven years when it lands in the Utah desert.\nOn Sunday, the ship will remain in space while a 100-pound (45 kg) capsule loaded with comet dust returns to earth and lands at the U.S. Air Force Utah Test and Training Range at 3:12 a.m. local time (5:12 a.m. EST or 1012 GMT). If the skies are all clear on January 15, then people from Northern California, Oregon and Nevada could get quite a show as the capsule enters Earth's atmosphere. The show will be quick, but should prove impressive.\nComets are thought to be remnants from the process of planet formation, and scientists said the dust collected by Stardust will give them their first opportunity to study pristine samples of materials formed billions of years ago. The particles from the comet were captured using a tennis-racket-sized space probe containing ice-cube sized compartments lined with aerogel, a porous substance that is 99.9 percent air. It is the first time since 1972 that any solid extraterrestrial material has been collected and brought back to Earth, and the first time ever for comet particles.\nDuring its descent over the desert, the capsule is scheduled to deploy two parachutes, though NASA officials said they have prepared for the possibility of a hard landing. A NASA probe called Genesis crashed to Earth in 2004 when its parachute failed to open. That craft had been on a three-year mission to collect solar wind ions, which were recovered by scientists even though the spacecraft was destroyed.\nStardust's project manager, Tom Duxbury, said that \"after the Genesis incident and the Columbia shuttle disaster, the mission's team spent six months testing and reviewing the spacecraft's design to make sure there were no errors\". Once the craft is recovered, it will be whisked away to the Johnson Space Center in Houston. Only after it is in a secure lab, free of potential contamination, will the probe be pried open to reveal its payload.\n\"We are at the end of a fantastic voyage,\" Don Brownlee, the lead scientist for the mission known as Stardust, recently told reporters at a media briefing. \"We will learn a phenomenal amount\u2026 from the most primitive materials in our solar system. It is a real thrilling time.\" Now, near the end of its long voyage home, the probe is set to plunge back to Earth in the predawn hours on Sunday."}

Australian climate change observers have attacked the AP6 outcomes as grossly irresponsible, saying the Federal Government is willing to accept the reality of runaway climate change.\nA communique released by the AP6 states: \"We recognise that fossil fuels underpin our economies, and will be an enduring reality for our lifetimes and beyond\" - the document said. Green groups say the pact has missed a vital opportunity to commit to renewable energy sources. They say the two-day meeting failed to make any serious commitments in combatting global warming. \nCombined, the United States, China, Japan, India, South Korea and Australia, account for around half the globe's greenhouse gases. The six countries set up the summit as an ulterior method of tackling global warming outside the Kyoto Protocol by, they say, focussing on \"clean-energy technology.\"\nNuclear Power, clean coal technologies, geosequestration and industry-driven environment funds were some of the proposals raised at the summit. Unlike the Kyoto Protocol the six nations have not set any targets to cut greenhouse gases.\nClimate change observers have broadly criticised the AP6 as a waste of time. Australian Climate Institute's Clive Hamilton says the meeting did little to cut greenhouse gas emissions. \"I think really this conference is about trying to protect the long-term future of the coal industry,\" he said. \"If you look at the sort of business people who have a seat at the table at the conference in Sydney, they overwhelmingly represent the polluting industries rather than those that will at some time in the future replace them - the renewable energy and energy efficiency industries.\"\nCSIRO chief scientist Dr David Brockway says the technology required to reduce greenhouse emissions is not viable for industry. \n\"It has to be borne in mind that anything we are going to do to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and intensity from the Australian economy will come at a cost,\" he said. \"What we are doing at the moment is doing research to try and reduce the size of that additional cost. I would say in a five to 10 year timeframe a number of these technologies will become viable.\"\nAn AP6 communique issued at the end of the conference said reductions in greenhouse gases must be achieved without hindering economic growth - \"the partnership aims to mobilise domestic and foreign investment into clean and low-emission technology by fostering the best possible enabling environments,\" it states. Some of the world's big mining and energy firms attended the talks and pledged to improve efficiency.\nGreen groups, who were left out of the conference, say the talks were aimed at subverting Kyoto - which obligates some 40 developed countries to cut greenhouse emissions by 5 percent below 1990 levels during 2008-2012. \"Basically, they haven't agreed to do anything in terms of serious commitment,\" said Monash University climate change expert Professor Amanda Lynch. The United States and Australia refuse to sign Kyoto claiming its mandatory greenhouse gas cuts would threaten economic growth. \nAustralian Prime Minister John Howard said, \"experience has taught us that seeking arbitrary targets doesn't result in achieving practical solutions to global climate change.\" Mr Howard stressed the importance of maintaining economic growth to alleviate poverty, while cutting greenhouse emissions.\nHe said the summit had injected \"an overdue dose of realism into the debate about climate change. We believe it is possible to tackle issues of greenhouse gas emissions and the challenge of climate change without reducing living standards,\" he said. \"The world will go on using fossil fuels for many years into the future because it's more economic to do so. So therefore it's elementary commonsense that you should try and make the use of fossil fuels more greenhouse gas sensitive, you should try and clean up the use of fossil fuel,\" he said.\nThe World Wildlife Fund (WWF) have dismissed Mr Howard's comments as misleading and irresponsible. The WWF's chief executive Greg Bourne said, \"in my whole business career, I have never seen a more misleading public statement as that... If the statements made today become a reality, this will lock us in to a four-degree rise in global average temperatures, when two-degrees is considered extremely dangerous,\" he said. \"There couldn't be anything more irresponsible than to knowingly embark on a path towards massive increases in emissions and runaway global warming.\"\nThe AP6 nations said in the final communique that the eight public/private partnership taskforces created at the conference, will draw up action plans by the middle of 2006 on issues including renewable energy, power generation, cleaner fossil fuels and coal mining.\nEnvironmentalists said the Sydney pact was doomed to fail because it did not impose targets on its members which comprise nearly half of humanity. The New South Wales Nature Conservation Council said the group's voluntary approach was a \"licence for government and business to do nothing\". \"Without any incentives or penalties there is no reason for industry to move away from burning polluting coal and oil,\" said the council's Cate Faehrmann.\nThe AP6 countries encompass: 49 per cent of world GDP; 48 per cent of the world energy consumption; 48 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions; and 45 per cent of the world's population. \nMany scientists say global warming is melting glaciers, raising sea levels and will cause more intense storms, droughts and floods. Current levels of carbon dioxide and methane in the atmosphere are higher now than at any time in the past 650,000 years, research from Antarctic ice cores shows."}

Its closest competitors, CouchSurfing and GlobalFreeLoaders, have 40,000 and 30,000 members.\nHospitality exchange organisations are dedicated to putting travellers in contact with locals offering to host them in their house for free, or simply offer them a tour of their city or share a meal with them. Besides the obvious financial advantage, the Hospitality Club believes that \"bringing people together and fostering international friendships will increase intercultural understanding and strengthen peace.\"\nServas Open Doors, the oldest network, in fact formally views itself as a peace initiative, and there are also a number of smaller hospitality exchange networks which focus on specialized audiences, such as Agritourism.\nw:Veit K\u00fchne from Dreseden, Germany, who founded the Hospitality Club in 2000 while he was still a student, believes that \"one day, everyone will have the opportunity to visit any country knowing that someone will be waiting to receive them with open arms. People will travel in a different way, meet each other and build intercultural understanding through personal contact.\"\n\"There will be many members in places like Israel and Palestine, Northern Ireland, the Balkans, Chechnya, Rwanda, or Timor who will exchange hospitality with each other, and in small steps the Hospitality Club will have helped making peace a lasting vision for our wonderful planet,\" he adds.\nHospitality Club was the first online organisation to offer on a major scale the possibility for travellers to find and contact locals open to cultural exchange. The whole system is entirely free, and hosting fees are supported by Google advertisements. The safe and efficient operation of the 30+ languages website and its database, forum, and chatroom depends on the work of hundreds of volunteers from around the world.\nAnybody can become a member, but they must provide their full name and address, for security reasons. All members have a profile they can fill with information about themselves and their preferences, to help prospective visitors contact the person most likely to welcome them.\nThe most often mentioned drawback of the system is lack of security. The main difference between hospitality exchange networks and other social networking platforms such as Orkut or LiveJournal is that the former's ultimate objective is to allow for face-to-face meetings. Users should realise that there is a risk involved, although according to Frenchman Jean-Yves H\u00e9gron, main software developer of the Hospitality Club, \"By using the Club you have the same level of risk as the one you face whenever you get out from your home.\"\nDiscussion about strategic or security issues is not allowed on the website's forum, hence critics often mention lack of transparency in how they perceive decisions are taken by volunteers in Hospitality Club. Another point of critique is the fact that there is no legal organisation behind Hospitality Club, and the domain name is registered to the founder of the Club himself. Messages containing links to other hospitality exchange networks were at some point deleted without further notice though this policy has since then been reverted. Exponential growth of the network has also caused server failures alike to those observed in Wikipedia until recently.\nThe idea of free hospitality exchange is not new. Servas was the first organisation to develop it, right after World War II. It still exists to this day, with over 15,000 members, and is represented as an NGO in the United Nations. Because democratic, paper-based Servas is perceived as bureaucratic by some, Hospex was created as the first online network in 1991.\nHospitality Club succeeded to Hospex in August 2000, introducing innovative security features ranging from spam protection to passport control and a sophisticated feedback system, thus making online hospitality exchange available to travellers with higher safety concerns. From 1000 members in July 2002 to 10,000 in February 2004, it quickly grew to 100,000 on 11 January 2006 and is expected to reach the million in about two years."}

The National Security Council spokesman for Iran, Hossein Entezami, said Thursday on a national broadcast that \"Iran still believes diplomacy could be productive.\"\nThe UN Secretary-General, Kofi Annan said after a Thursday telephone conversation with Ali Larijani, Iran's top nuclear negotiator, that they \"are interested in serious and constructive negotiation but within a time frame.\"\nOn the one hand, the United States and Europe have grown increasingly concerned over Iran and its decision to resume full nuclear research. \nOn the other hand, the concerns about the failure of the nuclear weapons states such as France, USA and UK to progress in nuclear weapons disarmament as is required by Article VI of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, which were summarised at the Non-Proliferation Treaty conference, June 2005 by the Malaysian representative, Rastam Mohd Isa, have not been addressed.\nTalks between Europe and Iran stalled late yesterday to a near standstill and the E.U. joined with the U.S. in its decision to refer Iran to the UN for possible sanctions.\n\"Our talks with Iran have reached a dead end,\" the German foreign minister, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, said at a news conference in Berlin Germany. \"From our point of view, the time has come for the UN Security Council to become involved.\" Germany is a state alleged by the Non-Aligned Movement to be in violation of Articles I and II of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty due to nuclear sharing.\nCondoleezza Rice, the U.S. Secretary of State, said that \"Iran's actions have shattered the basis for negotiation.\"\nWhen asked if military force was an option (in Iran) Rice said \"The president of the United States never takes any of his options off the table and nobody would want the president to do that... We are on a diplomatic track and it's not on the agenda at this point to move from that diplomatic track.\" \nRice's comments have added to speculation that if all diplomatic negotions with Iran fail, that attacks on facilities in Iran using mini-nukes might be a possibility.\nDespite the criticism from America, Europe, and quite possibly Russia and China, to get Iran to reverse its current course, some diplomats and experts say that the process of getting Iran near that step may take a long time, and may never even work. During the Non-Proliferation Treaty conference, June 2005, it was said that getting USA, France and the UK to disarm according to their obligations under the NPT may also take a long time, and may never even work.\nIran's government continues to insist that its nuclear path is for \"peaceful purposes.\" In a noted turn from Iran's use of aggressive language in defining their position on politically sensitive issue, Entezami said, \"Iran pursues its nuclear research activities in the framework of the International Atomic Energy Agency regulations and under the supervision of the agency. So there is no reason for challenging Iran's rights in the field of nuclear fuel.\" "}

Australia and East Timor have signed a treaty to share revenue from the Greater Sunrise energy field located in the Timor Sea. The treaty means each country gets half the revenue from the area - but any further negotiations on maritime boundaries will be postponed for up to 50 years. \nThe treaty, signed in Sydney on January 12th was attended by Australian Prime Minister John Howard and his East Timorese counterpart Mari Alkatiri. The treaty is the culmination of long-running negotiations and bitter disputes between the two countries on how to split the $40 billion resource.\nEast Timorese Prime Minister Dr Mari Alkatiri said the landmark agreement would provide a major boost to the nation's revenues - while protecting its territorial sovereignty. \"I am confident this is for the benefit of the people,\" he said. Dr Alkatiri anticipated production may be up to 10 years away.\nHowever, an Australian lobby group has vehemently attacked the failure to address, what they say, the bigger and more important issue of permanent maritime boundaries. Timor Sea Justice Campaign (TSJC) spokesman Tom Clarke says the Australia government did not respect conventional maritime boundaries. He says the postponed decision on maritime boundaries means East Timor will not be able to gain control of their territory. \n\"The Australian Government has basically bullied the poorest country in Asia into postponing its claim to sovereignty,\" said Mr Clarke. \"So a permanent maritime boundary will not be established under this deal - they're basically leaving that issue for future generations to negotiate.\" \nOther non-government organisations (NGO's) have protested about Australia's exploitation in the disputed area. A communiqu\u00e9 signed by 12 East Timor NGO's stated that the maritime frontier with Australia should have been established first, before the exploration of resources began. \nAustralian energy giant Woodside Petroleum, operator of the Greater Sunrise project, has given no indication as to when the development might go ahead. Company spokesman Roger Martin said there were still a few steps to go before the Greater Sunrise joint venture partners would be making any decisions on how to proceed.\nPrime Minister John Howard believes the deal is a fair and just outcome and will strengthen relations between the two countries. \"It means that the very close relationship between our two countries can not only continue but become even closer,\" he said.\nBut Tom Clarke (TSJC) has described the deal as a \"stop gap, band-aid solution\" - because nothing had been settled on the issue of maritime boundaries. \"It simply postpones the real issues of sovereignty for half a century,\" he said. Mr Clarke said East Timor clearly had more claim over the energy field than Australia. \n\"The Australian Government has continually and blatantly refused to abide by International Law. Instead, it has bullied the poorest country in Asia into a series of dodgy resource sharing deals, to take billions of dollars that simply do not belong to us,\" he said.\nThe campaigners claim the deal marks another sad chapter of Australian foreign policy betrayal, saying the Howard Government is determined to increase Australia's reputation as a bully in the region. \"This really should have been a very simple matter of just drawing a line half way between two coastlines, but once again the greed and self-interest of our, the Australian Government, has brought shame to all Australians who believe in a fair go,\" Mr Clarke said."}

Onboard are dust particles that have been collected from the comet Wild 2. \nWhen the capsule gets to Earth and enters the atmosphere, at about 5am (eastern time), it is expected to put on quite a light show for folks in Northern California, Oregon, Nevada, and Utah. The capsule will look much like a shooting star going across the sky. The capsule will be traveling at about 12.8 km or 8 miles per second, fast enough to go from San Francisco to Los Angeles in one minute. Stardust will set a new all-time record for being the fastest spacecraft to return to Earth, breaking the previous record set in May of 1969 during the return of the Apollo X command module. \u201cIt will move over the west coast of northern California and will light the sky from California through central Oregon and on through Nevada and Idaho and into Utah,\u201d Tom Duxbury, Stardust's project manager said.\nThe capsule will then release a parachute approximately 32 km (105,000 feet) and descend into the Salt Flats of Utah. If weather is permitting, it will be recovered by helicopter teams and taken to a cleanroom at the Michael Army Air Field, Dugway Proving Ground, for initial processing.\nThe capsule itself, only weighs 45.7 kilograms (101 pounds) and resembles a mini Apollo capsule.\nNot only will it break the record for the fastest spacecraft to return to earth, Stardust Principal Investigator Don Brownlee of the University of Washington, Seattle, says \u201cWe are nearing the end of quite a fantastic voyage \u2013 our spacecraft has traveled further than anything from Earth ever has \u2013 and come back. He also added that \u201cWe went half-way to Jupiter to meet the comet and collect samples from it. But the comet actually came in from the outer edge of the solar system, out beyond the orbit of Neptune, out by Pluto.\"\nIf the capsule makes it safely back to earth, scientists hope to unlock many secrets about the formation of our universe. \n\"Locked within the cometary particles is unique chemical and physical information that could be the record of the formation of the planets and the materials from which they were made,\" said Dr. Don Brownlee, Stardust principal investigator at the University of Washington, Seattle.\n\"Comets are some of the most informative occupants of the solar system. The more we can learn from science exploration missions like Stardust, the more we can prepare for human exploration to the moon, Mars and beyond,\" said Dr. Mary Cleave, associate administrator for NASA's Science Mission Directorate.\nStardust is bringing back the first samples of contemporary interstellar dust ever collected, and is also the first mission to return samples from a comet, as well as the first sample return mission from the Galaxy. Not one grain of contemporary interstellar dust grain has ever been examined in a laboratory before.\n\"We think a significant fraction of comets will be stardust particles actually older than Earth and older than the Sun, and for drama the stars, and the way you identify those is by their isotopic ratios,\" Stardust Principal Investigator Don Brownlee said. \"There are fabulous tools now to analyze these and a very anxious group of scientists waiting for these samples.\"\nStardust's main mission was to capture dust particles from comet Wild 2, but it is also believed to have captured dust from distant stars, perhaps created in supernova explosions less than 10 million years ago.\nThe dust can only be found using using a high-magnification microscope with a field of view smaller than a grain of salt. \nBut now they have the difficult task of trying to find all these millions of particles, which takes more time and man power that NASA has. That's where NASA decided to try Distributed Computing.\nDistributed computing has been a huge success. Most of the credit of the success of distributed computing, can be given to the scientists at the University of California, Berkeley. Scientists there have had and continue to have huge success with a program they created called SETI@home, which now uses the distributing platform BOINC.\nWith the success of BOINC and other distributed computing platforms, NASA hopes to achieve its goal in half the time with the public's help by creating the project Stardust@home\n\"Like SETI@home, which is the world's largest computer, we hope Stardust@home will also be a large computer, though more of a neural network, using brains together to find these grains,\" said Bryan Mendez of the Center for Science Education at the Space Sciences Laboratory. \nBut, the project is not for everyone. First, you will go through a web-based training session and then you must pass a test to qualify to register and participate. In the test, the volunteer is asked to find the track in a few test samples. To judge the reliability of the user, they also plan to throw in some ringers with and without tracks. \nIf at least two of the four volunteers viewing each image report a track, that image will be fed to 100 more volunteers for verification. If at least 20 of these report a track, UC Berkeley undergraduates who are expert at spotting dust grain tracks will confirm the identification.\nAfter passing the test and registering, you will be able to download a virtual microscope (VM). The VM will automatically connect to their server and download so-called \"focus movies\" -- stacks of images that we will collect from the Stardust Interstellar Dust Collector using an automated microscope at the Cosmic Dust Lab at Johnson Space Center. The VM will work on your computer, under your control. You will search each field for interstellar dust impacts by focusing up and down with a focus control.\nThe other neat thing is that there are no limitations and the more images you examine, the better chance you have at finding an interstellar dust grain.\nAny interstellar dust particles that you find, then you will appear as a co-author on any scientific paper by the Stardust@home collaboration announcing the discovery of the particle.\nCurrently the project is only accepting pre-registration and will be available to the public in mid-March, even before all the scans have been completed in a cleanroom at Houston's Johnson Space Center. In all the project is expected to need at least 30,000 person hours, to go through all the images, at least 4 times by 4 different participants.\nBerkeley will host and maintain the project, but it is unlcear as to whether or not the project will use the BOINC platform.\nThe virtual microscope was developed by computer scientist David Anderson, director of the SETI@home project, along with physics graduate student Joshua Von Korff.\nThe Stardust spacecraft was launched on February 7, 1999, from Cape Canaveral Air Station, Florida, aboard a Delta II rocket. \nThe Stardust project is expected to cost $170-million-dollars with a journey that will have lasted over 7 years and actually went around the Sun three times, and \"back in time to 4.5 billion years in time to gather these primitive samples that just were released from a comet\u2019s nucleus,\" Duxbury later added."}

A former \"high-ranking official\" in the U.S. Department of Defense told \"Panorama\" that the agents helped to track down targets throughout the Iraqi capital for the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) as they didn't have enough reliable sources in Baghdad. A BND official, also speaking on condition of anonymity, told the \"S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung\" that there was \"no dumbness between the BND and DIA\" during that time and that it was part of the BND's \"job\" in Iraq to identify \"non targets\" like hospitals or embassies. He said this was authorized by the chancellor's office.\nThe Pentagon informant of \"Panorama\" however said that the German agents were much more involved. A common saying during the war was supposedly: \"Do we have anything from the Germans?\" According to him, they drove to a restaurant in Mansur district of Baghdad on April 6th where Saddam Hussein was assumed to be dining. The BND agents reported back to the DIA that many Mercedes cars were parking there. As those cars were presumed to be of Saddam Hussein, the U.S. military conducted an air strike on the location. Hussein escaped, but twelve civilians were killed.\nThe BND confirmed that two of its agents operated in Iraq during the war but denied all other reports. A spokesperson told \"Panorama\" that it's agency \"did not provide target information or target coordinates to the warfaring parties.\" The intelligence committee of the Bundestag exculpated the BND. Its chair Norbert R\u00f6ttgen said that the in secret sitting committee, controlled by government parties, concluded with two-third majority that there are no indications that the agents aided the U.S. in selecting targets.\nGerman foreign minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier called the accusations \"schizophrenic\" while opposition parties are demanding an parliamentary investigation committee. And during a visit of German chancellor Merkel to the White House, U.S. president Bush said in a response to a reporter's question whether he knew anything about the allegations: \"The truth of the matter is, the Chancellor brought this up this morning. I had no idea what she was talking about. The first I heard of it was this morning, truthfully\"."}

It shows the counts of faint blue stars, from a narrow magnitude and color range, that are 10 kiloparsec away from Earth.\nThe map is shown in the Lambert projection of galactic coordinates: radial rays are lines of constant longitude, circles are lines of constant latitude, the North Galactic Pole is in the center, and the Galactic Centre is towards the left. The counts are shown on a logarithmic stretch, with a dynamic range of 10 increasing from blue to red.\nThe dotted line through the middle of the map shows the plane of the debris from the Saggitarius dwarf galaxy that is being cannibalized by the Milky Way. This debris is approximately four times further away from Earth than the Virgo super star cluster is. Astronomers have hypothesised that the two may be related.\nAstronomers at Sloan Digital Sky Survey have announced the discovery of a huge star cluster, the Virgo super star cluster 10 kiloparsecs (32,600 light years) away from the solar system (roughly the same distance as the galactic centre), in the constellation of Virgo. Many of the stars have been known to astronomers for centuries, but only now have they realized the existence of the cluster.\nIn a presentation to the American Astronomical Society, Princeton University graduate student Mario Juric, the principal author of the findings, explained: \"Some of the stars in this Milky Way companion have been seen with telescopes for centuries, but because the galaxy is so close, its stars are spread over a huge swath of the sky, and they always used to be lost in the sea of more numerous Milky Way stars. This galaxy is so big, we couldn't see it before.\"\nThe large overpopulation of stars was discovered by researchers analyzing SDSS-I and SDSS-II data. SDSS has, to date, imaged roughly one-quarter of the northern sky. The method used was the photometric parallax method. \"We used the SDSS data to measure distances to 48 million stars and build a 3-d map of the Milky Way.\" explained Zeljko Ivezic of the University of Washington, a co-author of the study.\nThis discovery is one in a series of such discoveries made within the last decade by a new generation of sky surveys. The Saggitarius dwarf galaxy was discovered in 1994 using photographic sky images. Since then, analysis of photographs by large digital cameras has identified several streams and clumps of stars, some of which (astronomers believe) are Milky Way companions and others of which are shreds of the Saggitarius dwarf or other dwarf galaxies that are also dissolving into the Milky Way. An earlier SDSS discovery was the Canis Major Dwarf Galaxy. \"With so much irregular structure in the outer Galaxy, it looks as though the Milky Way is still growing, by cannibalizing smaller galaxies that fall into it,\" said Juric.\nThe first indication that the Virgo super star cluster existed was in 2001, when the Quasar Equatorial Survey Team (QUEST) survey, using a 1-metre telescope in Llano del Hato National Astronomical Observatory in Venezuela, found a clump of five RR Lyrae variable stars, which astronomers speculated might belong to a small galaxy being canibalized by the Milky Way. Kathy Vivas of the Centro de Investigaciones de Astronomia in Venezuela, the author of the QUEST paper on the discovery, commented that \"In light of the new SDSS results, it appears that the stellar stream we detected is itself part of the larger structure identified by Juric and collaborators.\"\nIn a letter to the \"Astrophysical Journal\" the QUEST has presented further evidence for Vivas' interpretation, by measuring the motions and chemical compositions of stars in the region."}

Hospital officials say that Sharon remains \"lightly sedated\", but are not sure when he will wake up once they stop giving him the sedatives.\nNew reports say an EEG has shown that Sharon has activity on both sides of his brain and doctors say that's the most \"promising\" signs they have had since they started to bring him out of the coma. Doctors also say that activity in both lobes doesn't indicate anything about the extent of the brain damage. \"It is another piece of information that on its own means nothing,\" said Dr. Gal Ifergan, a neurologist at Soroka Medical Center in Beer Sheva, who is not treating Sharon. \nAlthough he has activity on both sides of his brain, Sharon could still have extensive brain damage, Ifergan said. He also said that it's \"very worrisome that he hasn't woken from his coma\", yet.\nThere are 2 major types of stroke, and Sharon has had both. The first was a mild stroke Dec. 18 caused by a blood clot that lodged in an artery in the brain, cutting off blood flow and causing minor damage. The second occurred just one day before he was scheduled to undergo surgery to repair a hole in his heart. This one was a severe cerebral hemorrhage\n\"After nine days he has had very slow progress and that indicates more permanent injury to a level where his quality of life is affected,\" Dr. Demetrius Lopes, a Rush University Medical Center neurosurgeon said. \"And then decisions will have to be made,\" he added.\nSharon's condition is still critical but stable."}

The contest was initiated after Charles Kennedy admitted in a press conference that he had previously sought professional help for an alcohol problem. Initially, Mr Kennedy had stated that he intended to run for re-election in a leadership contest. However, after 25 MPs said they would refuse to serve on the front bench under Charles Kennedy, he resigned immediately and said he would play no part in the leadership contest.\nAt the meeting today, which had been organised before Kennedy's resignation, the four candidates - Sir Menzies Campbell, \nMark Oaten, Simon Hughes and \nChris Huhne - were permitted to make 12 minute speeches outlining their vision for the party. The speeches were broadcast live and unedited on BBC News 24, with clips from them appearing in news bulletins later that evening.\nThe current acting party leader, Menzies Cambell, the first to declare his intention to stand, said that he wanted new thinking to tackle poverty and social injustice, new thinking to underpin a modern constitution, and a radical democratic revolution. He suggested that international cooperation was the way to make poverty history, and spoke against the decision to invade Iraq. He stressed his \"experience\" as being a key quality needed for a Liberal Democrat leader.\nThe MP for the Winchester constituency, Mark Oaten, praised the success of previous leader Charles Kennedy. He pledged to do all he could to defeat attacks on civil liberties in coming months, and stressed that it was important to try and defeat the identity card bill due to be voted on next month. He suggested that the party \"needed to be more progressive, ambitious, and optimistic\" and should avoid talking about politics in terms of 'left' or 'right'. Speaking about the environment, he said that the solution was not to \"dictate how people should lead their lives\" but offer positive measures enabling people to take their environmental responsibilities seriously.\nThe current party president, Simon Hughes, who unsuccessfully ran for the London mayoral position in 2004, promised a consultative leadership and said he wanted the Liberal Democrats to be the \"party of fairness\". He attacked Prime Minister Tony Blair as having 'failed', with the poorest paying a bigger propotion of their income in taxes than the richest. He said that there was a need to tackle inequality, and promised to stick with the policy of taxes to tackle inequality. He also supported greater decentralisation of power, and stressed the continued importance of environmental policies.\nFormer MEP Chris Huhne focused on environmental issues, questioning the government's lack of conviction to the Kyoto targets and the panicked response to the fuel protests. He spoke against David Cameron's lack of environmental conviction and suggested that only realistic means of tackling carbon emissions was through taxation, which could help change behaviour. Higher eco-taxes should be combined with lower personal taxes for those at the bottom of the economic scale, he argued. He also promoted greater powers and accountability for local authorities.\nThe nominations for leadership candidates close on 25th January, with candidates needing the declared support of at least 7 MPs and 200 party members from at least 20 different constituencies. No other candidates other than the four above are expected to stand. The vote closes on the 1st March, with the result due to be announced on the 2nd March."}

The Christian Heritage Center which would stretch over 125 acres is placed where, according to Christian tradition, Jesus taught and lived in the Galilee region. Robertson was one of the people at the heart of the project which was supported by many other evangelicals who worked to raise $50 million (USD).\nIsraeli tourism minister, Avraham Hirchson, and Robertson were just about to sign an agreement that the Israeli government would set aside land and infrastructure for the site, when Robertson made comments on his daily show, \"The 700 Club\", claiming that Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's stroke was \"Divine retribution\" for withdrawing from the Gaza Strip. Robertson said, \"'This is my land,' and for any prime minister of Israel who decides he is going to carve it up and give it away, God says, 'No, this is mine.'\" Many evangelicals considered the withdrawal as retreating from biblical prophecy of Jewish sovereignty over the Holy Land.\nRobertson's comments earned him a harsh backlash from many different groups, including the White House and former Presidential candidate, Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts. A spokesperson for Robertson said the comments were taken out of context.\nOn Wednesday, Robertson sent a letter addressed to Sharon's son Omri apologizing for his comments. In the letter, Robertson said Sharon is \"kind, gracious, and gentle man\" who was \"carrying an almost insurmountable burden of making decisions for his nation.\" The letter further added, \"My concern for the future safety of your nation led me to make remarks which I can now view in retrospect as inappropriate and insensitive in light of a national grief.\" Robertson wrote, \"I ask your forgiveness and the forgiveness of the people of Israel.\" According to the Israeli Ambassador to the United States, Israel accepts the apology.\nHowever, despite the apology by Robertson, it was doubtful that he would be brought back into the plan. Hirchson said on Wednesday that \"Robertson's help was no longer welcome.\" \nIronically, Robertson helped make television ministries what they are today, and the Heritiage Center would contain studios and satellite uplinks for live broadcasts. The groundbreaking for the project is slated to begin later in the year."}

After a fierce firefight and U.S. bombings of the compound, U.S. special operations forces Sgt. Christopher Speer, who has training as a medic, led a group of US soldiers searching the compound in the belief that everybody inside had been killed. According to U.S. army reports, Omar Khadr, who was wounded by the bombings and the only survivor in the compound, fired his pistol and threw a grenade which killed Christopher Speer and wounded three others. In response, Khadr was engaged by U.S. forces and shot three times, which left him nearly blind in one eye.\nWhile still 15 years old, Khadr was transferred to the U.S. detention facility at Guant\u00e1namo Bay, where he was kept together with adult detainees, separate from other children who received better treatment and some formal education. Now Khadr is 19 and is facing the tribunal operated exclusively by the US military. \nThe tribunal is referred to by different media organizations as a \"war crimes court\", a \"military commission\" or a \"military tribunal\". Its legality is presently under dispute. The USA has not ratified the international treaty creating the International Criminal Court, so the nature of the tribunal under international law is unclear. The Miami Herald reports that \"military defense lawyers and legal observers [condemn] the so-called military commissions as stacked against the defendants\", but that the chief Pentagon prosecutor, Air Force Col. Morris \"Moe\" Davis defended the tribunal, stating that the purpose of the tribunals is to provide a fair trial while addressing an enemy whose actions had not been anticipated under the Geneva Conventions. \"We have nothing to be ashamed of, and I'm proud of everybody involved in the process,\" he said.\nThe Supreme Court of the US is expected to decide on the constitutionality of this type of military tribunal in the next few months, with oral arguments in March, to consider charges that the \"tribunals\" violate US obligations under the Geneva Conventions. \nKhadr has requested an upgrade to his legal team. The military defense lawyer appointed to him by the tribunal is a 31-year-old army captain, who has never before handled a trial defense and just recently returned from his tour of duty in Iraq."}

FIFA rules state several situations in which celebrations may lead to booking;\nHowever, the rule which BSkyB stated in the pre match commentary was more relevant, because the aforementioned rules were not in any way broken; referring to the fact that perimeter fences were only common in Spanish football. The guideline stated that \"\"leaving the field to celebrate a goal is not a cautionable offense in itself but it is essential that players return to the field as soon as possible\".\nDespite the justification of the referee's call, both Robben himself, and commentator Andy Gray questioned the common sense nature of the decision, noting that quick thinking and spontaneous decision should be something a referee focuses on, rather than the implicit enforcement of minor rules.\nIn response to the decision, Andy Gray noted;"}

The role of president of Finland has become smaller the past years due to changes in the constitution, though president is still head of foreign policy and the commender-in-chief of the Finnish Defence Forces. \nOne of the main issues in this election is Finland's relation to NATO. Some candidates like Halonen and the green candidate Heidi Hautala oppose and some candidates like Niinist\u00f6 and Henrik Lax support joining NATO.

He has also recommended against confirming his death or otherwise.\nProfessor Williams, the Visiting Fellow at the Australian National University's Strategic and Defence Studies Centre said the information, which came from a former Indian intelligence officer whom he would not identify, was credible but impossible to confirm. \n\"It does seem reasonably convincing based on the evidence that I've been provided with that he's certainly either severely incapacitated or dead at this stage,\" Dr Williams said. \nBut he said, \"Even if he's dead, it will be almost impossible for Western authorities to prove it. It may simply be that we don't hear much about Bin Laden again ... [or] he may pop up again in six months' time and make a new statement, at which case, of course, we will go back to Square1.\"\nAl-Qaeda in Iraq leader Abu Musab al-Zarqawi's actions in targeting Shi'ites in Iraq were another factor raising doubt that bin Laden was still leading al-Qaeda. Bin Laden had promoted a pan-Islamic vision and had tried, unsuccessfully, to attract Shi'a Muslims to al-Qaeda.\n\"From what I have read, Zarqawi had a great deal of respect for bin Laden, so it would seem unlikely that he would be doing that if bin Laden was still around,\" said Williams. There was also the question of how long an ill man like bin Laden, who walked with a cane and suffered from a kidney disease, would survive in the tribal areas of Pakistan, where he was thought to be hiding.\nHowever, the United States believes Bin Laden still alive. Osama Bin Laden and his deputy are thought to be living in the area of a missile strike apparently aimed at Ayman al-Zawahiri, said US counter-terrorism ambassador Henry Crumpton. He said the al-Qaeda leader and his number two were believed to be in the Pakistan-Afghanistan border region.\nThe US has not commented on the attack on a Pakistan village on Friday that killed 18 civilians. US media said the attack was carried out by the CIA. Thousands of Pakistanis later staged anti-American demonstrations. "}

After a string of decisions (which the red half of Manchester perceived to be unfair) being given in City's favour, and with the untimely booking of Ronaldo, both Ferguson and Rooney were pushed to their limits of patience, swearing out loud in disbelief.\nRooney was first to be heard mouthing off after the decision was taken to give Ronaldo his marching orders. He was observed swearing at the referee at half time, and then continuing the tirade throughout the game as a string of bad decisions were taken which stripped United of their fluidity in the game. Despite the language from Rooney being far from usual, a barrage of assaults were thrown to and from the referee and the striker right through the game.\nAfter the decision was given to take off Christiano Ronaldo, Ferguson's temper boiled and he was heard by many sitting around him to call the referee a \"f*cking tw*t\" as well as calling his decisions a \"f*cking disgrace\". This later led on to Ferguson launching threats at the referee during half time, and accusing the referee of not being able to handle under the pressure of a premiership game as well as questioning his judgement of the offside rule.\nFerguson himself admitted that Ronaldo's tackle was rash, and also noted that the side seemed to get better after he had been sent off, saying that they were playing better with 10 men. He still maintained that the side defended well, despite the fact that new signing Patrice Evra and Mikael Silvestre afforded City easy opportunities to slip goals in.\nThe fine that both Ferguson and Rooney will receive is unknown, although it is thought to be similar to the ban he received in 2003, in which he received a 3 match touchline-ban, and a \u00a3100,000 after swearing at Jeffery Winter.

Greenpeace organised the international day of action as it continued its efforts to disrupt the hunting of minke whales by the Japanese whaling fleet currently in the Southern Ocean. \nThe day of action was being marked to protest the actions of the fleet which protesters believe violate the 1986 International Whaling Commission (IWC) global ban on commercial whaling. Japan's JARPA Japanese Whale Research Program was allowed to operate under a Special Permit in the Antarctic according to Article VIII of the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling. In its JARPA-2 plan, Japan plans to double its annual scientific research catch of to 935, and to add 10 to its quota. The International Fund for Animal Welfare states that over the next two years, Japan plans to kill 50 endangered and an additional 40 fin whales.\nInternational Anti-Whaling Protesters' Day of Action.\nNumerous reports of actions taken in Australia and New Zealand focused on public awareness of the Japanese whaling efforts and collecting signatures of people opposed to whaling.\nAustralia.\nAt Sydney's , anti-whaling campaigners asked bathers to sign a dozen metre-high cardboard whale tails placed in the sand and called for an end to whaling in the Southern Ocean. Signatures from a Sydney petition would be added to tens of thousands collected elsewhere in the country. They will be handed to the Australian government and Japanese consulate in June.\nWaverley mayor Mora Main urged Japanese tourists who enjoyed whale watching in Australia to pressure their government to end whaling.\nIn Melbourne, protesters collected hundreds of signatures on a seven metre long fabric whale to take to the Japanese consulate. Campaigner Simon Bradshaw said up to 300 people signed the whale within 15 minutes at Flinders Street station.\n\"Australia is pretty much unequivocally opposed to the whaling hunt on environmental grounds as well as animal rights grounds,\" Mr Bradshaw said. \"People have been rather disturbed and horrified (by the whaling), so I think they're grateful to be given even a small thing they can do to express their opposition to it.\"\nSignatures were also collected in Brisbane and Hobart. In the Tasmanian capital, about 50 people were applauded by bystanders as they marched through the city centre, chanting slogans and waving placards against whaling. Protest organiser Jessica Sheldrick says it is part of a national day of action in four capital cities to educate people about whaling in Australia's Southern Oceans.\n\"Basically, we're here to support our activists that are down there endangering their lives, just to save our marine mammals,\" Ms Sheldrick said. \"People are, on the whole, totally in support of Greenpeace's stance in whaling in the Southern Oceans. They don't believe it should be happening.\"\nNew Zealand.\nIn New Zealand, whaling has been condemned at an Auckland beach protest. A mock graveyard of black minke whale tails, symbolic of those killed in the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary, was displayed on an Auckland beach. \nGreenpeace New Zealand say the tails represent the more than 900 whales killed by Japan this season. More than 100 people turned up at Mission Bay beach to mark the International Day of Action against Whaling. Around 250 wooden whale tails were placed in the sand and a giant whale tail of sand was made on the beach by children and their parents. \nThe New Zealand Greens Party say diplomatic measures have failed to stop the whaling and the government should explore legal options, including the Antarctic Treaty which allows observers to inspect research ships.\nWhaling conflict in the Southern Ocean.\nThe was designated by the IWC as a sanctuary for whales in 1994.\nJapan abandoned in 1986, in line with an international moratorium, yet resumed whaling the following year for what it says is \"scientific research\". Japan's whaling program includes fin and humpback whales, both of which are on the World Conservation Union's list of threatened species.\nJapan's Institute of Cetacean Research says its whaling is legal and scientifically necessary for sustainable resource management.\nInternational Whaling Commission rules permit the research hunt, but Australia and other anti-whaling countries say it is commercial whaling in disguise as the meat collected from the \"research\" is later sold in Japan. Critics say Japan is off-loading whale meat for consumption in restaurants and supermarkets.\nInternational views of whaling today.\nMeanwhile, Australia, Britain, Brazil, France and Germany were among 17 countries calling on Japan this week, to halt to its Antarctic whaling program. \"The fact that 17 countries supported this representation, shows how important this issue is, and the depth of feeling around the world,\" British fisheries minister Ben Bradshaw said in a statement.\nThe statement calls on Japan to \"cease all its lethal scientific research on whales,\" and was delivered to Japan's foreign and farm ministries.\n\"We urge Japan to reconsider its positions and end this unjustified and unnecessary slaughter which is regarded by many countries as a means to by-pass the IWC (International Whaling Commission) moratorium,\" Bradshaw said.\nOther signatories of the statement were Argentina, Austria, Belgium, Finland, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Mexico, New Zealand, Portugal, Spain and Sweden.\nJapans view of the issues.\nJapan opposes a ban on whaling, insisting it is part of the country's traditional culture, and has continued to hunt whales for scientific research since the International Whaling Commission introduced a moratorium on commercial whaling in 1986.\nMore than 6,800 Antarctic Minke Whales have already been killed in Antarctic waters since Japan began its Whale Research Program 18 years ago. Meat from whales killed for research is later consumed at Japanese restaurants. \nThe Japanese government has defended its whaling activities, saying that whales are caught for research purposes only. They have also said that they are not breaking international law, in a statement issued by Chief Cabinet Secretary Shinzo Abe.\n\"I understand that Japan's research whaling follows international rules and is done for the purpose of research on whales' ecosystem,\" Chief Cabinet Secretary Shinzo Abe, the government spokesman, told reporters.\nThe Japanese whaling industry's Institute of Cetacean Research (ICR) claim serious violations of maritime laws during the recent anti-whaling actions. \"Already, there are serious violations that provide reasons for concern in terms of safety and international maritime law,\" ICR director-general Dr Hiroshi Hatanaka said in a statement.\nThe ICR said Greenpeace had not stopped the whaling fleet from conducting its research. \"The issue of sound management and sustainability of whale stocks are far too important to be sidetracked by a D grade public relations campaign,\" Dr Hatanaka said.\nGavin Carter, an adviser to the ICR, a nonprofit Japanese research organisation, said Japanese quotas for whale kills are well below the mammals' reproductive rates.\n\"The purpose of this research,\" said Mr Carter, \"is to create a knowledge bank, which the government can then use to facilitate a regulated whaling industry.\" Mr Carter urged critics of commercial whaling to be sensitive to other nations' cultural differences, noting that Japanese have \"used whales for centuries. They eat the whole thing. They use every part. Who are we to tell them what to eat, or what not to kill?\" he asked.\nGreen Peace's actions.\nThe Greenpeace vessel Arctic Sunrise has been shadowing the Japanese whaling fleet for several weeks in a bid to disrupt Japan's annual whale hunt, prompting many heated exchanges. Canadian activist Texas Constantine was thrown out of a small inflatable boat that had been manoeuvring between a harpooner and a minke whale. He spent several minutes in the icy waters before being hauled back on board. \nThe harpoon killed the minke whale and its tow rope threw into the water Greenpeace activist Joe Constantine, who was able to climb back aboard the boat to safety, the environmental watchdog said.\n\"We were out defending the whales. We had been out there for about an hour. I was driving our boat and we were in a good position and the whaler fired its harpoon,\" Constantine said in a statement. \"All of a sudden the harpoon line came down on us trapping us between the whale and the catcher,\" he said. \"The line came tight at that point and threw me from the boat into the water. It was a few minutes before our boat was able to come over and pick me up out of the water.\"\nThe Institute of Cetacean Research in Tokyo accused Greenpeace of taking increasing risks in harassing the whaling fleet. \"The fact that the rope fell onto their inflatable and one of the activists fell into the water is entirely their fault,\" the institute's director general Hiroshi Hatanaka said Sunday.\nSources.\n__NOEDITSECTION__"}

Coastwatch is searching the Torres Strait for the 25m boat. Four children are among the 43 people believed to be on board. The 25-metre traditional boat is believed to have left the port of Merauke, Papua, on Friday headed for Australia's Cape York peninsula.\nConvenor of the Australia West Papua Association Louise Byrne says the group included some of Papua's leading independence advocates. She said they were forced to undertake the journey by boat because the usual means of escaping Papua \u2013 crossing the border into Papua New Guinea \u2013 had become increasingly difficult. \n\"The border has tightened up a lot in recent times,\" she said on ABC radio. Ms Byrne said sheer desperation had forced the group to flee Papua. \"Although it hasn't been announced, I think the Indonesian Government has changed its policy and is now realising that ... autonomy isn't working and I think they're about to implement a military solution,\" she said.\nMs Byrne could not say whether she believed Australian authorities should prepare for an influx of asylum seekers from the region. Ms Byrne was told of the group's escape from Papua in a phone call last week. She said fears were growing for the safety of those on board the boat, which was now three days overdue.\n\"They're not anywhere, so I'm concerned for where they are and that's why the National Search and Rescue have started looking this morning,\" Ms Byrne said. \"We've been spending a rather frantic weekend looking for them because it's not far across the Torres Strait,\" she said. \"It should have taken them a maximum of 15, 16 hours.\"\nThe Australian immigration department says surveillance flights in the Torres Strait have failed to locate the boat. A department spokesman says Coastwatch surveillance flights in the Torres Strait region have been adjusted to search for the boat but it has not been sighted. \nAustralian Greens Senator Kerry Nettle has written to Foreign Minister Downer requesting that he make inquiries with the Indonesian Government to establish if they have intercepted the missing asylum seekers. \n\"I am concerned that the boat carrying West Papuan asylum seekers could have been intercepted by Indonesian authorities en route to Australia,\" said Senator Nettle. \"If the Indonesians have intercepted this boat it would be a relief that they have not sunk at sea, but I am concerned about their fate at the hands of Indonesian authorities given recent arrests of West Papuan activists and ongoing human rights abuses. \nAboriginal communities in Cape York are being put on alert.

He additionally recommended Congress to hold comprehensive hearings and for telecommunications companies who are assisting in the program to stop doing so, and suggested the administration is using the threat of terrorism as a means to amass power in the executive branch.\n\"Is America in more danger now than when we faced worldwide fascism on the march - when our fathers fought and won two World Wars simultaneously?\" He added, \"Once violated, the rule of law is in danger. Unless stopped, lawlessness grows. The greater the power of the executive grows, the more difficult it becomes for the other branches to perform their constitutional roles.\"\nThe Republican National Committee responded to Gore's statements, saying, \"Al Gore's incessant need to insert himself in the headline of the day is almost as glaring as his lack of understanding of the threats facing America.\" They continued, \"While the president works to protect Americans from terrorists, Democrats deliver no solutions of their own, only diatribes laden with inaccuracies and anger.\"\nOn Tuesday, White House press secretary Scott McClellan also responded, saying that the Clinton administration had authorized an FBI search of double agent Aldrich Ames without a warrant. Attorney General Alberto Gonzales made similar remarks earlier. Regarding Gore, McClellan said, \"I think his hypocrisy knows no bounds.\"\nOpponents of the wiretapping program say this is an inaccurate comparison. On Monday's edition of Larry King Live, New York Times reporter James Risen said that \"under the rules at that time the Attorney General could authorize a warrantless physical search of a house. After the Ames case,\" he added, \"Congress changed that and closed that loophole and so that now that kind of search couldn't be done under the law.\"\nResponding to the White House and Attorney General's comments, Gore said, \"The Attorney General is making a political defense of the President without even addressing the substantive legal questions that have so troubled millions of Americans in both political parties. There are...problems with the Attorney General's effort to focus attention on the past instead of the present Administration's behavior. [As] others have thoroughly documented, his charges are factually wrong.
