The system is the current system in all Canadian provinces, and is also used to elect in Ottawa. The other system is , which would replace 85 single-member ridings with 20 larger ridings in which between two and seven (MLA) would be elected. The total number of MLAs will not change. Voters would rank the candidates in order of preference, as many or as few as they wish. When the results are tallied, votes are transferred to the next preference on the ballot when the first preference has been elected or eliminated. The system is designed to ensure that every vote helps to elect someone, every vote counts as fully as possible, and every voter is represented by a candidate they voted for, as nearly as mathematically possible. \nPrevious elections held under the current Single Member Plurality (also known as First Past The Post) system led to in certain elections, such as the where the winning party obtained 77 of the 79 seats of the legislature with just 58% of the vote, and the , in which the party with the most votes failed to win the election.

They argue that BC-STV will give voters the power to hold politicians and political parties accountable, by giving every voter a vote that actually makes a difference. If the STV system is approved, then it will be put into use for the first time for the 2013 provincial election.\nThe recognized opponent group is the No STV Campaign Society. Their arguments are that STV will give larger ridings, voters would be unsure of whom their MLA would be, there would be unequal geographic representation, that the counting method is too complicated, the electoral system results are unverified in practical usage, the system results in a higher probability of minority governments and the subsequent coalition of parties. They also argue that other countries who use systems similar to STV have had problems with their election results.\n$500,000 in public funding has been given to both the proponents and the opponents of the referendum.

The IMF was originally founded in 1946 as the overseer of the Bretton Woods system, which from its founding until the 1970s tied the western world's currencies to the US Dollar, which was in turn backed by gold. Russia's proposal was for the new currency to serve as a reserve currency, one which would take the place of the dollar, euro, and other heavily-traded currencies as an international standard of exchange.\nMedvedev's comments are a reversal of Russian position from a lukewarm response following a looser outline for a worldwide currency by Kazakhstani president . On March 11, Nazarbayev suggested the establishment of the \"acmetal\", a portmanteau of \"\" and \"capital\", as a reserve currency replacing the ruble in international transactions, first for and then worldwide. 1999 Economics Nobel laureate Robert Mundell, speaking to the \"Daily Telegraph\", endorsed the idea, saying \"It would be a very good idea if the G-20 took that idea up in London\". \n2001 Nobel economics prize winner , meanwhile, said the new currency could come about quickly if it was based on an expansion of the IMF's already established system of Special Drawing Rights, units of exchange used by the IMF which already have some of the features of currency. Stiglitz argued that, as the US dollar has become the standard global reserve currency, it has inadvertently created a system which hurts the world economy. \"It's a net transfer, in a sense, to the United States of foreign aid,\" he argued, reasoning that when other countries purchase US dollars in order to use them on international markets (such as for the buying and selling of petroleum), they effectively give the US a zero-interest loan \u2014 sometimes at times when they can least afford it. Stiglitz made his comments as head of a United Nations panel of economists giving recommendations to address the global financial crisis.\nIn the weeks leading up to the G-20 conference, the People's Republic of China also began discussing a new system for reserve currencies. In a March 23 speech, Zhou Xiaochuan, governor of the People's Bank of China, endorsed a new reserve currency, saying \"the desirable goal of reforming the international monetary system, therefore, is to create an international reserve currency that is disconnected from individual nations and is able to remain stable in the long run, thus removing the inherent deficiencies caused by using credit-based national currencies.\" Zhou went on to endorse the expansion of the SDR system in the long-term creation of a reserve currency government by the IMF. While Zhou did not mention the US dollar specifically, analysis by Qu Hongbin, chief China economist for HSBC, for the \"Financial Times\" said that the speech \"is a clear sign that China, as the largest holder of US dollar financial assets, is concerned about the potential inflationary risk of the US Federal Reserve printing money\".\nChina holds $740 billion as assets; inflation in the US economy, which has been low in recent years, would directly cause those assets to lose value.\nWhile the Chinese government has engaged in currency swaps with several other growing economies, such as South Korea, Argentina, Malaysia and Indonesia, the Chinese Yuan cannot be used itself as a reserve currency as it cannot be freely traded on the global market.\nThe Chinese-Russian proposal was not entered onto the agenda at the G-20 meeting itself. Nonetheless, British Prime Minister Gordon Brown said that the G-20 was open to considering the proposal if and when a detailed one is presented. United States President Barack Obama, meanwhile, endorsed the continuation of dollar supremacy, saying that the US dollar is \"extraordinarily strong\" and arguing that its strength was the result of the intrinsic stability of the United States economic and political system; US treasury secretary Timothy Geithner had, the week before, made comments that while he supported an expansion in the SDR mechanism he rejected the idea of a global currency. Rather than change the role of SDRs, the G-20 meeting instead added $250 billion in support to the fund backing SDRs.\nAfter the G-20 conference ended on Thursday, Malaysia's \"The Star BizWeek\" reported that the central banks of Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand had endorsed the Chinese proposal. All three countries have close economic ties with China and suffered heavily from the collapse of their currencies in the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis; the sudden growth in the value of the US dollar relative to those countries' native currencies sharply increased debt in Southeast Asia's economies, leading to a wave of bankruptcies.\nInternational reaction from other economies has been mixed and guarded. Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, President of Brazil, said that the currency proposal was important to discuss but did not give extensive comment. And while UPI reports that India supported the SDR proposal at the G-20 conference, the Indian Press Trust quotes Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh as saying last month, \"It is too early to talk about common currency.\"\nCalls for an independent global reserve currency are not new. In 1944, John Maynard Keynes proposed the \"bancor\", a unit like the SDR supported by a basket of commodities. Keynes' idea was rejected and the US dollar took the equivalent role under the Bretton Woods system. Keynes proposed that the bancor system would be reinforced by a tax on participating countries' current accounts, the difference between their exports and their imports, in order to encourage balanced trade. Meanwhile, monetary unions have become more popular since the end of the gold standard, with most of the European Union now trading the euro, and several countries outside the EU using it as a de facto currency; five West African countries adopting the eco at the end of this year; and the African Union planning to introduce the afro in 2028. Proposals for a North American currency union based around the so-called \"amero\" have been frequently discussed as the focus of conspiracy theories in the United States, but none of the US, Canada or Mexico have actively pursued the establishment of any such monetary union, however the dollar is the currency of several Latin American countries."}

It decides what experiments to do, what to test.\" He says that for other lab experiments the hardware is already in place, the only step needed is to change the software.\nThe artificial intelligence alone spans three computers which holds the databases and analytical software to enable Adam to think. For the yeast experiment, Adam was loaded with databases which hold known information relating to yeasts and organisms. Adam compared all fields in the database to find the areas of missing information from which he devised 20 hypotheses.\nAdam's AI is connected to , , and cameras which enable Adam to start over 1,000 individual experiments every day and follow their progress over a week.\nA part of the process is that Adam's AI can cycle and analyze the results of the experiments as well doing routine repetitious lab work. Following Adam's testing, King's team manually tested three of Adam's hypotheses and found that the robot's conclusions were correct, and each was a breakthrough to the scientific community.\nAdam has spawned discussion amongst researchers. William Melek, an assistant professor of mechanical engineering at Ontario's University of Waterloo, has noted that to set up the AI needed for subsequent experiments involving new biological variables and criteria, the human expertise would be time consuming to customize it.

A neighbor says an estimated 100 rounds of ammunition were shot off before the suspect surrendered to police. The shooter, upon surrendering, was taken to the UPMC Presbyterian hospital with injuries. \nEdward Perkovic, a friend of the alleged shooter, told local news affiliate WTAE-TV that Poplawski called him around 8:30 a.m. on the phone and said that \"he [Poplawski] was going to die today.\"\n\"This was a complete surprise to me and my family and everyone's families that were friends with him.

Therefore, police had to move the media away from the scene for a short time. In the end, Pennsylvania state police, Allegheny County police, Pittsburgh police, SWAT members and a state police helicopter responded to scene.\nWPXI-TV reporter Rick Earle said his sources say one of the injured officers was shot in the hand, and the other broke his leg while jumping over a fence.\nOne of the officers who was fatally shot, a thirteen year veteran with the Pittsburgh Police, was off-duty at the time but responded to the scene to offer his help. The two other officers who were fatally shot allegedly joined the police force in 2007.\nPolice spokeswoman Diane Richards said medics at the scene were unable to reach the wounded officers for a while because of the continuous shooting.\nWPXI-TV reports that Poplawski had previously been training to become a U.S. Marine, but was kicked out of boot camp.

Two F-16 fighters had been dispatched to follow the Cessna which later landed near US 60 in Ellsinore, Missouri, but NORAD spokesman Mike Kucharek said that the aircraft was not thought to be a terrorist threat.\nSgt. Marty Elmore, a spokesman for the Missouri Highway Patrol, says Leon was arrested about 9:30 CDT near the site of his landing. Leon is a person of Turkish origin who became a Canadian citizen in 2008 and changed his name from Yavuz Berke. Leon jumped a fence and stole the plane, according to local radio.\nAccording to Kucharek, the aircraft began behaving erratically around 2:30 CDT. He also says the pilot, at the time unidentified, appeared to acknowledge the fighter craft but did not heed their instructions. Leon's motive is not known.\nManagers at Central Wisconsin Airport in Mosinee, Wisconsin earlier said the facility was preparing for a forced landing of the aircraft, but the attempt to force it to land was scrubbed. \nThe aircraft later crossed the border out of Wisconsin and passed over Illinois north of the city of St. Louis, Missouri. It flew further south before landing in Ellsinore on Route 60, at which point the pilot fled on foot. Attempts to establish contact with or discern the intentions of the pilot were unsuccessful.\nThe distance from Thunder Bay to Ellsinore is , near the reported maximum range of a Cessna 172, but authorities say the aircraft had two hours of fuel left. Only Leon is believed to have been on board the aircraft."}

Lead comedian, producer and writer, Brent Butt was recognised at the signing ceremonies for developing what is called the most successful Canadian show made. \n\"For six great seasons, Corner Gas has welcomed people from across Canada and around the world to our province, and made short work of the misconception that there's 'not a lot going on' in Saskatchewan. We want to thank Saskatchewan's own Brent Butt, the Corner Gas producers, cast and crew for many hours of laughter.\" said Wall, \"Their stories have really captured the spirit of this great province, and shown off Saskatchewan to the world.\"\nCorner Gas has an audience of 1.4 million in Canada since first airing in January 2004. The show has been honoured with over 80 nominations, and diverse accolades and awards such as six Gemini awards, one of which was Best Comedy Series.\n\"I'm honestly humbled by this. It's a wonderful and much appreciated gesture by my home province to honour us in this way. It's the type of honour you don't even think about happening, so when it does, it makes you stand up and think: 'Wow, maybe we really did something here',\" said Butt.\nJoking with Wall, Butt suggested that \u201cCorner Gas Day\u201d should be a statutory holiday, if not for everybody then at least for service station attendants. The proclamation signing was aired on CTV the same Monday that Wall was featured in a cameo appearance on the Corner Gas series episode, \"Get the F Off my Lawn\". Wall was filmed in a scene in which he was getting his gas tank filled up at the Corner Gas service station.\nSusanne Boyce, President, Creative, Content and Channels, CTV Inc said \"It's farewell, not goodbye. While April 13 marks the series' finale, the memories and the legacy it leaves behind will live on forever. A heartfelt thank you goes out to everyone who have made this history-making series a juggernaut success, and to the millions of fans who visited Dog River weekly.\"\nThe Canadian comedy series is aired by CTV Television Network in Canada and is distributed to 26 countries worldwide.\nThe popular sitcom, \"Corner Gas\" is filmed about south of Regina in the tiny farming community of Rouleau. CTV will air tributes on April 13 in honour of Corner Gas and Dog River which feature the cast and behind the scenes footage."}

The aircraft had crashed due to the excessive speed that it landed at, with prosecutors originally claiming the crash was deliberate while Komar blamed an issue with the flaps. The charge of intentionally crashing was later dropped.\nThe court found that as Komar had not notified co-pilot Gagam Salman R. or air traffic control of any issue with the aircraft despite having two minutes to do so he was negligent. Had the airport been aware of the problems on board, they could have readied Aircraft Rescue and Firefighting crews to prevent or contain the fire when the plane departed the runway. As the plane approached the runway the Ground Proximity Warning System sounded fifteen times to inform the flight crew the jet was going too fast for a safe landing.\nHe was sentenced to two years in prison, half the term prosecutors were seeking. Lead prosecutor Mudin Aristo said that \"we're considering [appealing] the verdict.\" M. Assegaf, Komar's lawyer, has already said that he will appeal. \"The case should not have been tried under that article [479G(b)], which is used to regulate terrorists. Captain Marwoto is not a terrorist\", said Assegaf. \nGaruda Pilots\u2019 Association president Stephanus Gerardus and Napitupulu of the Federation of Indonesian Pilots both commented that the case should not have been in a criminal court at all but in an aviation court. Garardus commented that \"Pilots will be afraid to land their planes because of the threat of imprisonment.\"\nThe judges, who were split in their verdict as one felt that all charges should be dismissed, ruled that the position of such a court was unclear and that it had no jurisdiction to hand down jail sentences. They also said that Law No. 1/2009 on profession courts, which applies to such a court, was not in place at the time of the accident.\nOthers felt that the sentence was too light. Then-Australian foreign minister Alexander Downer commented that \"it seems a very light sentence frankly. I understand from the evidence that was presented that there was nothing mechanically wrong with the aircraft and that the pilot just landed the plane at far too high a speed, way over the limit of the landing of an aircraft.\" Five Australian diplomats and journalists travelling on flight 200 to attend a counter-terrorism conference that Downer appeared at in Indonesia were amongst the dead.\nCaroline Mellish, sister of Australian journalist Morgan Mellish who died on the flight, also said the sentence was light. \"I don't feel like justice has been served... And hearing he only got two years made it even harder,\" she said. Kevin Keevil, father of AusAID's Allison Sudradjat, who also died, had a similar opinion.\n\"It does not give me any peace of mind,\" said Keevil. \"I have a personal belief that the sentence is inadequate given what transpired on the day, especially in view of the pilot's behaviour.\"\nThe verdict, which was attended by Komar's wife and teenage sons, garnered widespread public interest. For the four hours that proceedings lasted the courtroom was at capacity and many people were listening from outside."}

Instead he yelled 'fire' a few times then walked to the police station where an ambulance took him to a local hospital for the treatment of minor burns. The fire department later arrived to put out the blaze and his apartment was extensively smoke damaged. 11 other apartments were also damaged, leaving the occupants without a place to stay for at least a week.\n\"I should have never used that,\" said Krajniak during a court appearance on Monday. He admitted to knowing that gasoline was highly flammable. He was arrested and his bond has been set a US$2,500. Krajniak's next court appearance is scheduled for Monday, April 13. According to WISinfo.com, Krajniak has no prior criminal record.\nThe careless smoking of cigarettes has been blamed for thousands of fires across the U.S. In January 2008, an unnamed elderly woman in Buffalo, New York was receiving oxygen for medical problems in her home and lit a cigarette and began to smoke it. The oxygen coming from her mask then facilitated the ignition of her clothing, setting her on fire.\nIn the U.S. in 2002, only 4% of all residential fires were reportedly caused by smoking materials. These fires, however, were responsible for 19% of residential fire fatalities and 9% of injuries. The fatality rate due to smoking is nearly four times higher than the overall residential fire rate; injuries are more than twice as likely. Forty percent of all smoking fires start in the bedroom or living room/family room; in 35% of these fires, bedding or upholstered furniture are the items first ignited. "}

Norm Coleman from 225 to 312 votes, local news agencies reported Tuesday.\nIn November, the results of the 2008 United States Senate election in Minnesota showed Republican Norm Coleman with a 215 vote lead over the Democratic challenger Franken. The close margin \u2014 less than 0.0075 percent \u2014 triggered an automatic recount which resulted in Franken leading by 225 votes, the total ratified by the Minnesota Canvasing Board January 5. The Coleman campaign filed a motion January 6 in court to block the certification of Franken's victory and prevent Franken from taking a seat in the United States Senate. On March 31, a three-judge panel hearing the case ordered 400 additional ballots be considered for counting.\nState elections director Gary Poser read the results of 351 of those ballots to a hushed courtroom in St. Paul. Franken received 198 votes, while Coleman received 111. Third-party candidate Dean Barkley and other candidates got the 42 remaining votes.\nPoser was supervised closely by Minnesota Secretary of State Mark Ritchie, Franken lawyer Marc Elias and Coleman lawyer Tony Trimble.\nWith his case resting on the outcome of the unopened ballots, Coleman can no longer win mathematically, as he can now receive a maximum of 49 votes yet to be counted, which would not erase Franken's lead.\nFranken's campaign said the result told the story.\n\"The result confirms what we knew going in, which is that more Minnesotans voted for Al Franken than Norm Coleman,\" Elias told reporters. \"That was the case when we recounted the ballots the first time, and it's now the case after the election contest.\"\nThe Minnesota court can rule as soon as Wednesday and Coleman has ten days to appeal that ruling to the Minnesota Supreme Court. The Coleman campaign said it will file sooner than the ten-day time limit.\nColeman's campaign wants more than the 351 ballots added Tuesday counted. They have compiled a list of at least 1,300 ballots they want counted and Coleman legal adviser Ben Ginsberg was optimistic that more will be counted.\n\"It should have been about 10 times more than that,\" Ginsberg said. \"We will be appealing this to the Minnesota Supreme Court.\"\nGinsberg went on to say that Tuesday's decision was not a large one.\n\"What happened today in the sphere of this election is really inconsequential,\" Ginsberg said. \"What we've been saying is there's a much bigger pool of ballots that should be opened.\"\nAn election certificate requires both the signature of Ritchie and governor Tim Pawlenty. Pawlenty hasn't said whether or not he would sign the certificate though he did say that if Coleman appeals the Minnesota Supreme Court decision, the governor would be unable to sign the certificate until any federal legal process is concluded."}

Friedman admitted in a movie review late last week to having wached a bootlegged online video stream version of a partially-completed copy of the upcoming film \"X-Men Origins: Wolverine\", a Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation production. Friedman had worked for several years as a reviewer and media journalist for Fox News. While a press release from Fox says that the company and Friedman had \"mutually agreed to part ways immediately\", news articles report that he was fired.\nFriedman's status had been ambiguous after an April 5 statement from Fox that Friedman had been fired was met by a response from the journalist that no action had been taken against him.\nFriedman began his April 2 column, now removed from the Fox website, with: \"Yes, I've seen 'X Men Origins: Wolverine.' It wasn't at a screening, either. I found a work in progress print of it, 95 percent completed, on the internet last night. Let's hope by now it's gone.\" Friedman went on to praise the ease and convenience of downloading, noting that the current box office top 10 were all available. \"It's so much easier than going out in the rain!\", he wrote.\nIn an exclusive statement to \"Wikinews\", Pirate Party International's spokesperson Andrew Norton said: \"Depending on the method he used to obtain the film, he may not have infringed copyright at all, just exercised legal fair use exceptions. When you add in the very positive review he gave the film, it makes you wonder why Fox acted as they did. The reason is painfully obvious, to 'send a message'. Alas the only message they send is that they don't care about facts, and let no-one stand in the way of their paranoid witch-hunt\".\nWebsite Ain't It Cool News editor \"Beaks\", meanwhile, responded to news of Fox's initial press release concerning Friedman's review on April 3 with \"Friedman has admitted to breaking the law. If 20th Century Fox\u2014and the FBI\u2014are serious about nailing the perpetrator(s) of this leak, then Friedman must be fired immediately for downloading and reviewing stolen material. There's no wiggle room here.\"\nThe positivity of Friedman's review had led some commentators, Ain't It Cool News among them, to speculate that the leak of the work print of the film had been a deliberate act by 20th Century Fox.\nThe full-length workprint of the film, lacking some special effects and ten minutes of footage shot after principal photography, was leaked on March 31, 2009. While 20th Century Fox adds digital forensic markings to its workprints to trace leaked versions, so far the company has not identified any party as responsible for the leak.\n\"X Men Origins: Wolverine\", a prequel to the \"X-Men\" franchise of films, premieres in theaters in the United Kingdom on April 29, Australia and New Zealand on April 30, and the United States and Canada on May 1, 2009."}

The survey did not define either capitalism or socialism, but Rasmussen also cites a December 2008 result saying that 15% of Americans prefer a government-managed economy.\nAnalysis of the poll's data by website FiveThirtyEight.com furthermore found that support for capitalism was closely correlated with income; respondents earning under $20,000 a year having an eight percentage point preference for capitalism, while those earning more than $100,000 a year expressed a fifty-seven percentage point preference for capitalism. Rasmussen noted that socialism had much broader support among people under 30, where 33% support socialism and 37% support capitalism, than among any other age group.\nSocialism has found support in several countries, with member parties of the Socialist International in government in over 50 countries around the world and with several other regimes describing themselves as socialist or communist; the 20% result Rasmussen finds is comparable to the electoral support for the New Democratic Party in Canada. Support for an independent socialist movement in the United States, however, has historically been limited. Socialist candidate Eugene V. Debs won 6.1% of the popular vote in 1912, and two members of the Socialist Party, Victor L. Berger and Meyer London, were elected to the United States Congress before the Great Depression. This brief flirtation with socialism is contrasted against the times during and following the First World War and Second World War, which were marked by \"Red scares\" \u2014 periods of pronounced anti-communism \u2014 in the United States.\nCurrently, only a single member of the United States Congress describes himself as a socialist: Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont. The Social Democrats USA (SD USA), one of the successors of the Socialist Party of America, has expressed solidarity with the 76-member Congressional Progressive Caucus, which Sanders founded in 1991. It supports positions such as a living wage, universal health care, and the right of workers to form trade unions and engage in collective bargaining.\nSD USA executive director Gabriel McClosky-Ross offered \"Wikinews\" an exclusive statement on the Rasmussen poll result:\nWhile support for socialism in the United States may be growing, Rasmussen's polling finds that absolute majorities of the American public support both capitalism and free markets. Meanwhile, anti-communist sentiment remains strong in many segments of the US population, with opposition to socialism being a defining feature of Conservatism in the United States.\nIn an exclusive statement to \"Wikinews\", John F. McManus, President of the anti-socialist John Birch Society, offered the John Birch Society's position on the poll result:\nAmericans currently most often cite the economy as their number one concern in polls, ahead of terrorism. In December 2008, workers at the Republic Windows and Doors factory in Chicago staged a union-backed factory occupation in a fight against company management \u2014 a return to tactics of direct action from the historically more subdued American organized labor movement.\nOn April 10 2009, Alabama representative Spencer Bachus (R-Alabama) told the \"Birmingham News\" that seventeen members of the US House of Representatives are socialists. He did not specify which members."}

Armoured vehicles and bands of protesters are reportedly roving the streets of Bangkok and the prime minister has threatened to use force against the protesters.\nThe protesters are supporters of the National United Front of Democracy Against Dictatorship (UDD). They demand the immediate resignation of the prime minister and fresh elections.\nA group of protesters at the country's Ministry of the Interior, which Xinhua says numbered in the \"hundreds\", attacked the prime minister's Mercedes but he was not inside at the time. The ministry building was stormed by protesters and several police and protesters were injured during the ensuing riot.\nThe state of emergency comes after mass protests and an invasion of the conference site by UDD red-shirted demonstrators forced the abandonment of the sixteen-member ASEAN summit in the resort town of Pattaya yesterday. \n\"The government has to declare the state of emergency to restore normality as soon as possible,\" the Prime Minister was quoted as saying. This morning, the protesters were \"infuriated\" as the government arrested UDD leader and politician Arisman Pongruangrong, who led the Pattaya protest.\nThe protests come just months after the yellow-shirted People's Alliance for Democracy occupied airports in Bangkok, leading to the fall of the previous, Thaksin-aligned government. Thailand has had five prime ministers in the past 18 months since the Council for National Security relinquished power; the CNS took power in a 2006 military coup d'etat that deposed the Thaksin government.\nArmy spokesman Col. Sansern Kaewkamnerd called the deployment of troops a \"measure to restore order\" and denied it was another coup.\nDeputy Prime Minister Suthep Thaugsuban, in charge of the security measures against the UDD, stated on television earlier: \"Police and military officers must fully and forcefully carry out their jobs lest more damage is done. Actions must be taken promptly and order be restored as soon as possible. Your superiors and I will take responsibility for all your actions.\"\nThailand has remained in turmoil since the ousting of now-fugitive ex-premier Thaksin Shinawatra. A bloodless coup in 2006 saw him deposed, and he left the country to stay in the United Kingdom. While the courts in Thailand considered allegations of corruption against him and his wife, the UK government revoked his visa. In previous video conference and telephone addresses he has encouraged the red-shirted UDD protesters to oppose the current government.\nFollowing the coup that deposed Thaksin, the various people involved in the populist Thai Rak Thai (TRT - lit. \"Thais love Thais\") political party were forced to reform as TRT was outlawed. With significant support from the rural poor they won elections following the militarily appointed government stepping aside. Unrest following this, and charges of election fraud, toppled the new populist government."}

Their recommendations would see the use of audio-visual, photographic and audio media restricted in the digital domain.\n\"To avoid protracted disputes with media organisations and to ensure a minimum standard of protection across digital sports news reporting in Australia, AFL believes that the best means of introducing these restrictions is by way of amendments to the Copyright Act or a mandatory industry code,\" the AFL's submission said.\nWikinews asked the AFL, Football Federation Australia and the Sunshine Coast Daily for comment.

The protests are taking place peacefully on the grounds in front of the Storting, the Norwegian Parliament.\nThe demonstrators are supporters of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), popularly known as the Tamil Tigers. They criticised the Sri Lankan governments handling of Tamil civilians in the war zone in northern Sri Lanka and are attempting to get the Norwegian government to intervene diplomatically in the conflict to stop the Sri Lankan government from putting civilians at risk.\nThe peaceful demonstrations come the day after Tamil protesters stormed the Sri Lankan embassy in Oslo. In response, this morning the Sri Lankan government refused to let Norway continue its mediating role in the decades-long Sri Lankan Civil War; the Norwegian government, in response, has said its role in bringing the two sides to the table ended in 2006. The protest leaders have apologized for the invasion of the embassy.\nThe Norwegian government has given the demonstrators permission to demonstrate until Friday, but they are forbidden from staying all day or from camping on the Storting grounds.\nSri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapaksa declared a two-day cease-fire in government operations against the LTTE, the largest group fighting against the government, on Monday for the Sri Lankan New Year, to allow civilians to leave the combat zone. Tens of thousands of civilians, many displaced by the war, are in the combat zone.\nThe LTTE has been campaigning violently for an independent homeland for the Tamil people in northern Sri Lanka since 1976. The Sri Lankan government has recently enjoyed a string of military successes against the LTTE, who have been driven out of all major towns they once controlled. The Sri Lankan government has stated it believes that there are now only 500 LTTE fighters remaining, intermingled with civilians in the Jaffna Peninsula."}

CFTC Fishermans Union spokesman Bruno Dachicourt told Agence France Presse: \"There are easily twenty boats blocking the port of Boulogne-sur-Mer in organized ranks. Not a boat will go in nor out.\"\nThe fishermen are protesting the lowering of European Union quotas on fishing, which place a ceiling on the amount of fish that the fishermen of each member country are allowed to catch and sell. The EU has lowered quotas in response to concerns about the sustainability of fisheries, but each drop in quota reduces the amount of work each fishing vessel can do. \"The feeble amount of the quota obliges us to close the fishing zones three months after the beginning of the catch\", said St\u00e9phane Pinto, spokesman for the CFDT trade union group representing fishermen in Boulogne.\nFerry sailings between Dover in the United Kingdom and Calais were suspended, with UK authorities implementing the Operation Stack management plan in response. Under the plan sections of the M20 motorway are closed to traffic and used as a managed lorry park. Motorists have been advised to seek alternative routes if possible. Most cars and passengers from the P&amp;O Calais-Dover sailings at 16.10 (apparently the first sailing affected), 17.40 and 18.25 left on the \"Pride of Dover\" at 11.47 arriving Dover at 12.30. Two SeaFrance ferries, Renoir and another, left slightly earlier.\nFishermen have also used fires and roadblocks to interfere with access to the ports by road.\nThe blockades come eight days after a similar incident in the Mediterranean, when French fishermen in Marseille, Ajaccio, Toulon and other port cities interfered with oil tanker movements and blockaded ports throughout the south of the country.\nWikinews is unaware of any official statement from the British or French Governments in response to the blockade."}

At that time, the court collected $3 million in outstanding fines and netted $1 million for the city. Prior to 2002, the last amnesty program was in 1993. Chief Judge Marylin Atkins of the 36th District Court said her court tries to offer the amnesty program every 10 years, \"but because of the economy, we decided to do it this year.\"\nAs with a General Motors buyout, Atkins said this offer will not be extended. \"We\u2019re going to work with you, but you have to come in and see us during April,\" she said, \"because after that, we will come after you with the full force of the law.\"\nAtkins\u2019s court is offering a 50 percent reduction on the city fine, the state and ordinance late fees, the D36 cost and the late penalty on all civil infraction tickets. The tickets must be in default status or had a judgment from January 1, 2002, through December 31, 2008. Parking tickets are not included in the 36th District Court program.\nNine other district courts are participating. They are 17th District Court, Redford; 18th District Court, Westland; 21st District Court, Garden City; 24th District Court, Allen Park and Melvindale; 28th District Court, Southgate; 29th District Court, Wayne; 31st District Court, Hamtramck; Grosse Pointe Park Municipal Court; and 33rd District Court, Woodhaven.\nThe amnesty program varies among the courts. In Grosse Pointe Park, parking tickets are included, according to court administrator Karen Albrecht.\n\"In 2002, we got a lot of calls asking why we weren\u2019t taking part in the program,\" Albrecht explained. She said only Grosse Pointe Park among the five Grosse Pointe communities was taking part in the amnesty program.\nJudge Richard Hammer of the 21st District Court in Garden City encouraged individuals with outstanding tickets to call their respective courts to get the details of their participation in the program. \"We are fairly certain a great number of people are good, honest citizens who cannot get out from under their tickets,\" he said. Judge John T. Courtright of the 24th District Court in Allen Park and Melvindale concurred. \"I would encourage all the citizens to take advantage of the program,\" he said.\nPayable parking tickets are included in the 24th District Court's amnesty offer and are also reduced in Wayne, Woodhaven, Allen Park, Melvindale and Redford. Judge Atkins in Detroit said her court does not have authority to reduce parking tickets.\nJudge Hammer said violators do not have to be residents of the city in which their tickets were issued in order to take advantage of the amnesty program. \"Anyone coming to the same court will get the same treatment,\" he said.\nIn some cases, the savings to motorists could be substantial. In Westland, for example, the 18th District Court will waive the $35 default late fee, the $50 warrant cost and the 20 percent late fee on eligible cases.\nIn all courts, however, individuals who have had their licenses suspended must pay the $45 clearance fee to the State of Michigan. And in most, if not all, cases, adjusted fines must be paid in full. In most courts, credit cards, certified checks and money orders are accepted.\n\"While some other jurisdictions may be giving payment [plans], this court is not,\" Atkins said of the 36th District Court. \"This is a one-shot deal. Bring your money in before April 30.\"\nIndividuals who appear at their court to address violations covered under the program will not be arrested upon their voluntary appearance.\nThe judges and court administrators agreed that sometimes people get buried by fines and cannot climb their way out, especially under the current economic conditions. \"We find for some people their fines and fees just keep getting added on and on, and a person cannot pay a ticket even though they might have been able to otherwise,\" said Judge Courtwright of Allen Park.\nMotorists may call (313) 967-7400 or visit the \"36th District Court's\" Website for more detailed information regarding each court participating in the amnesty program."}

Funds raised will cover AIDS-related medication, supplies, and food for children infected with the disease in the hardest-hit countries, including Kenya, Uganda, and Zimbabwe.\nThe program includes Climb Up the 50, Climb Up the World, and Climb Up Kilimanjaro.

This happened on behalf of the Russian president Dmitry Medvedev who had already announced a possible withdrawal of the Russian troops at the G20 summit in the beginning of April this year. But some forces, the special forces of Moscow's ministry of the interior, will still stay in Chechnya.\nHuman rights activist Lew Ponomarjov welcomed the situation, saying that the counterterrorism situation in Chechnya had been a severe violation of human rights.\nLocal president Ramzan Kadyrov, son of former Chechen leader Akhmad Kadyrov who died in a bomb blast in 2004 in Grozny, is satisfied with the situation. He is now expecting more foreign investment and a better economic growth in the area. He declared April 16 as a future holiday in Chechnya. Human rights organisations, on the other hand, accuse him of letting his own militia torture and kill his opponents. \nIn the meantime, the local president Ramzan Kadyrov has informed the heads of the regional administration about the end of the operation and advised them yesterday to let the former militants return to a peaceful civilian life, Vesti.ru reports. But at the same time he settled that the rule should not apply to those rebels who had become extremists. These people \u2014 according to Kadyrov mostly living in the mountains \u2014 would not deserve any amnesty and not any public pardon, Kadyrov said.\nWhile there were some reports on a gun battle between Russian and rebels forces in southern Chechnya, Kadyrov said on April 21 that they had checked the reports, but did not believe that anything had changed since last week. He questioned the timing of the reports which had appeared right after the news was spread that the Russian soldiers would leave Chechnya. \nTuesday, the operative headquarters for Chechnya claimed that the Russian special police and troops had already started an \"anti-terrorism operation\" in the Itum-Kale and Vedeno, two Chechen districts. A spokesman said that they had \"received information that Chechen militants were preparing terrorist acts\" there. And so they had continued with the operation. Operations in further districts were announced on Friday, according to Voice of America. This too was refuted by President Kadyrov.\nRIA Novosti reported Saturday that four Russian soldiers were killed and at least three people injured in a number of shootings and bombings over the course of the past week. The firefights occurred in a Village and at a checkpoint, while the explosions all occurred near a Stadium in the capital of Grozny.\nThe republic of Chechnya has undergone two separatist wars in the past 15 years. The first one started in 1994 and was ended after about 21 months with the withdrawal of the Russian army. The second one started in October 1999 with the heaviest battles in 2002. Still, there is a conflict between the two parties concerning the independence of the republic from Russia. More than 100,000 people were killed in both wars, which makes about 10 per cent of the population of Chechnya. The announcement of the withdrawal of the Russian forces is seen as an official ending of the second war."}

The parade was to show the public the latest military equipment for its naval, ground and air forces."}

Ballard has died at the age of 78. Ballard died on Sunday after a long battle with prostate cancer. \nAccording to a spokesperson, Ballard had been sick \"for several years\" and that it was \"with great sadness\" to have to make the announcement of his death. He died at the home of his long-time partner. \nBallard is best known for writing the novels \"Crash\" in 1973 and \"Empire of the Sun\" in 1984 which won the James Tait Black Memorial Prize. Both books went on to be major motion pictures.\n\"He was a colonial figure in some senses. He had grown up in Shanghai and had very good manners. He was very generous and polite and it took a long while before he would do anything that wasn\u2019t very controlled,\" said friend and author Iain Sinclair to The Times.\nBallard was born in Shanghai, China in the Shanghai International Settlement in 1930. When he was 12, he and his family were forced to live in a camp run by Japanese forces during World War II. Ballard says that he won't say happy things about his experience in the camp, but also no unpleasant ones either. In an interview with BBC News, Ballard said \"I remember a lot of the casual brutality and beatings-up that went on, but at the same time we children were playing a hundred and one games all the time.\"\nIn 1946 he moved to the UK with his sister and mother where he began to write. Twenty years later, in the 1960's, he employed himself as a full time writer. He produced his first novel in 1961 titled \"The Wind from Nowhere\" and \"The Drowned World\" just a year later."}

Also released yesterday was a report by the Senate Intelligence Committee confirming that Bush administration officials, including Condoleeza Rice and John Ashcroft, had backed such tactics in secret meetings through June 2002. In the days following Rice's approval, the Justice Department had given the legal rationale for the use of waterboarding against Abu Zubaydah.\nThe Armed Service Committee report also indicates that Pentagon officials consulted with the military's Joint Personnel Recovery Agency (JPRA) as early as December 2001. Many of the techniques were reverse-engineered from the JPRA's Survival, Evasion, Resistance and Escape (SERE) program, which trains personnel to resist interrogation by enemies who use tactics banned by the Geneva Conventions.\nThe reports undermine claims made by several Bush-era officials that the leaked events of Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo Bay were the result of \"bad apples\" from the bottom of both the CIA and the Pentagon's command structure.

Countries should really take this opportunity to prepare themselves for the possibility for a pandemic,\" he said.\nIn response to the recent spread of the flu, the WHO recently raised its pandemic alert level from three to four, stopping two levels short of declaring a full pandemic.\nA WHO emergency committee recently cancelled a meeting to decide whether to move the alert level to the fifth level. \"If we have a confirmation from the United States or Canada, we could move to phase 5,\" said Gregory Hartl, a spokesman for the WHO. \"We are still at phase four because we do not have incontrovertible evidence this is an efficient spreader.\"\nA portion of the cases appear to have been obtained from human-to-human transmission outside of Mexico. Such transmission is frequently an early indicator of a coming pandemic, and experts expect the WHO to raise its pandemic alert up to the fifth level if such transmissions continue to occur.\nThe WHO has confirmed that the disease is not transmitted from animals or meat. \"There is no danger form eating pork,\" Hartl said. \"If you cook pork well, if you cook all meat well, it kills all virus[es],\" Hartl said.\nIn the United States, fifty people have fallen ill from swine flu. California has confirmed at least thirteen cases, three in Texas, two in Kansas, and one case in Ohio. New York has confirmed 28 incidents. The number is expected to rise, as confirmations from testing are still ongoing.\n\"The human swine flu outbreak continues to grow in the United States and internationally,\" said the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in a bulletin report. \"Today, CDC reports additional cases of confirmed swine influenza and a number of hospitalizations of swine flu patients. Internationally, the situation is more serious too, with additional countries reporting confirmed cases of swine flu.\" \nNew Zealand officials reported that eleven of the country's residents that had recently travelled to Mexico are now showing sypmtoms of the virus. Three of the infected persons had been confirmed to have the virus, Health Minister Tony Ryall stated.\nThe health ministry of Israel confirmed two cases of the flu in travellers. South Korea has reported a case in a tourist visiting Mexico, while Spain has recently confirmed two more incidents.\nMeanwhile, the situation in the epicentre of the outbreak, Mexico, is deterioriating. Mexican officials have told restaurants to serve only takeaway food, has closed schools until May 8, and placed Mexico City, the country's capital, under a high alert. Many public events have been cancelled, and masks have been given out to passengers on trains. Mexico City Health Secretary Armando Ahued stated that 6,610 people with symptoms of swine flu were admitted to hospitals on Monday, but only 29 had remained hospitalised.\nThe WHO on Tuesday stated that it would not endorse travel bans to attempt to stop the spread of the virus. \"Border controls don't work. Screening doesn't work,\" said the WHO spokesman, Hartl, adding that infected persons may not show any symptoms of the disease when at a border crossing or airport. \"Certainly, if you feel that you are ill, you should not travel, in any case, to anywhere,\" Hartl said.\nAmong the symptoms of the swine flu include temperatures of over 100 degrees Fahrenheit, diarrhea, vomiting, and heavy coughing. Many of the fatalities from the disease were forty years old or younger, not very young or old persons that are usually more susceptible to influenza."}

As a result, the World Health Organization (WHO) raised the pandemic alert level to 5. The United Nations has warned that the disease can not be contained. At least 91 confirmed cases of the flu have been reported worldwide.\nIn a special report, \"Wikinews\" takes a look at the reaction to the outbreak, and how different countries around the world have been affected by it.\nThe disease, which is believed to have originated in Mexico, has now spread across the globe, with confirmed cases having been reported in Canada, the United Kingdom, Spain, New Zealand, Costa Rica and Israel. The United States has also reported its first death from the disease in a toddler. South Korea and France both had probable cases.\nThe WHO said on Tuesday that while it was not yet certain that the outbreak would turn into pandemic, countries should prepare for the worst. \"Countries should take the opportunity to prepare for a pandemic,\" said the acting assistant director-general for the WHO, Keiji Fukuda.\n\"Based on assessment of all available information, and following several expert consultations, I have decided to raise the current level of influenza pandemic alert from phase 4 to phase 5,\" said Margaret Chan, the Director-General of the WHO, in a statement on Wednesday. \"...All countries should immediately activate their pandemic preparedness plans. Countries should remain on high alert for unusual outbreaks of influenza-like illness and severe pneumonia.\" After the announcement was made, \"Wikinews\" learned that the WHO website had crashed for several minutes, presumably due to high traffic volume.\nThere is no vaccine for swine flu. In 1976 during an outbreak of the virus, at least 500 people became seriously ill, and of them, 25 had died when inoculated with an attempt at a vaccination. The 500 that became ill developed a neurological disorder called Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS) which caused paralysis \"and is characterized by various degrees of weakness, sensory abnormalities and autonomic dysfunction.\" Those who developed the disorder did so because of an immunopathological reaction to the drug. Nearly 40 million US residents, including then US president Gerald Ford, were inoculated.\nCanada.\nScreening measures at Canadian airports have been raised on Tuesday to screen passengers returning from Mexico for symptoms of swine flu. The measures come amid reports that thirteen people have now been infected in the country, in four different provinces.\nThe Public Health Agency has recommended Canadians who have booked flights to Mexico to delay them if possible. Those who choose to fly anyway will be asked questions about their health after they return, such as whether they have had symptoms of the flu, like diarrhea, coughing, or a sore throat. If anyone answers in the affirmative, they may be further assessed and perhaps transferred to a quarantine officer, who will suggest that they seek medical help, or isolate themselves at home.\n\"These measures will help to prevent further spread and protect the health of Canadians and we thank you for your patience and co-operation with this process,\" said the chief public health officer, David Butler-Jones.\nSeveral Canadian airlines have also limited or cancelled flights to Mexico. Air Transat and its partner tour companies, Nolitours and Transat Holidays, have cancelled all flights bound to Mexico until June 1. West Jet has also stated that it will suspend all vacation planning and air flights for Cancun, Mazatlan, Cabo San Lucas, and other destinations in Mexico.\nEgypt.\nEgypt, which has not yet reported any cases of the flu, has recently begun a campaign to slaughter all 300,000 pigs in the country, despite assurances by health officials that the disease is not transmitted from animals to humans. \"It has been decided to immediately start slaughtering all the pigs in Egypt using the full capacity of the country's slaughterhouses,\" Egypt's health minister, Hatem el-Gabaly, told reporters.\nFarmers have been protesting the measure. At one pig farming area in the country, crowds of farmers blockaded the roads to prevent health officials from entering to slaughter their pigs. Some of the farmers hurled stones at officials' vehicles, and the latter was forced to retreat without killing any of the animals.\nMexico.\nIn Mexico, the epicentre of the outbreak, officials have announced up to 159 suspected deaths from the virus, out of a total of 2,498 suspected cases. The Mexican cabinet has announced that all flights departing from Mexico City will be suspended, while Argentina and Cuba have both cancelled all flights to the country. The European Union and the US have both issued warnings against traveling to Mexico.\nThe Royal Caribbean cruise line has suspended all stops in Mexico indefinitely, while Norwegian Cruise Line announced that its vessels will not make stops at Mexican ports until September of this year.\nThe government has ordered all restaurants in the country's capital to serve only carry-out food, and closed archaeological sites with the intent of limiting large groupings of people. Churches, gyms, pool halls, and other institutions in Mexico City have been asked to close. School classes across the country have been suspended until May 6.\nThe Mexican government has estimated that the epidemic is costing companies in the capital at least US$57 million per day, and that tourism revenue has dropped by 36%. The finance ministry has set up a special fund of $450 million to fight the disease.\nNew Zealand.\nThirteen confirmed cases have been known in New Zealand. All of them have been prescribed the antiviral drug Tamiflu.\nNew Zealand airports have now started to screen at least ten thousand people who arrive in the country from flights from Northern America. Those who display symptoms of the flu are taken aside by health authorities and placed into a quarantine.\n\"The number of suspected cases is likely in increase,\" said Fran McGrath, the Deputy Director of Public Health. \"While the numbers in any category will fluctuate, this is a pattern to be expected from an influenza outbreak. It is important to note that the 13 people we are treating as confirmed cases have all had mild flu symptoms, have received treatment and are all on the mend of have recovered.\"\nSpain.\nSpain's health minister Trinidad Jinenez announced on Wednesday that a total of 53 persons in the country are under observation for the influenza. The number of confirmed cases in the country has been risen from four to ten, including one person who did not obtain the illness by traveling to Mexico.\nUntil now, Jimenez said that all of Spain's confirmed cases involved persons who had recently visited Mexico, where the outbreak is believed to have began.\nUnited Kingdom.\nBritish Prime Minister Gordon Brown announced that five people who recently visited Mexico are now ill with the swine flu in the United Kingdom. \u201cAll of them have traveled recently from Mexico,\u201d he said. \u201cAll of them have mild symptoms. All of them are receiving and responding well to treatment.\u201d \nThe school of one the infected people, a twelve-year-old girl from Torbay, has been shut down and its 230 pupils given the drug Tamiflu, Brown said.\nThe Prime Minister said that the country is preparing for a possible pandemic. It has increased its stocks of antiviral drugs, enough for fifty million people, and ordered additional face masks for health workers. The government has encouraged all British residents to avoid travel to Mexico.\nUnited States.\nA 23-month-old boy from Mexico died at a Houston, Texas hospital on Wednesday, the first casualty from swine flu in the United States. The child had arrived in Brownsville, Texas, near the border with Mexico, with unspecified \"underlying health issues\" on April 4. Several days later, he presented symptoms of swine flu, and was hospitalized on April 13. The next day, the boy was transferred to a Houston hospital, where he remained until dying on Monday night of pneumonia brought on by the virus.\nIn response to the epidemic, Texas governor Rick Perry has given a disaster declaration. Schools have closed down statewide. Californian governor Arnold Schwarzenegger has also declared a state of emergency in his state.\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) updated the number of incidents of swine flu in the country to 64 on Tuesday.\nPresident Barack Obama has asked Congress for a fund of $1.5 billion to fight the outbreak, saying that it is needed for \"maximum flexibility to allow us to address this emerging situation.\"\nUS health authorities have warned that more cases and fatalities from the flu are probable. \"We expect to see more cases, more hospitalizations, and, unfortunately, we are likely to see more deaths from the outbreak,\" said Kathleen Sebelius, the Health and Human Services secretary."}

Another ten homes were also damaged as high winds fanned the flames through the district. Police are investigating a possible case of arson during the brushfire when residents were evacuating.\nOver 100 firefighters and five helicopters were out fighting the fire.\nPeople were awakened from their sleep at three a.m. local time to report into the Red Cross evacuation centre.

Increased unemployment and financial hardship consequent to the ongoing global financial crisis led to larger demonstrations than in 2008, but violent incidents in some world cities marred the day of celebration.\nIn Germany, 57 were arrested as young protestors threw bottles and set fire to cars in the capital, Berlin. Scattered violence also took place in Hamburg. 48 police and an unknown number of demonstrators are said to have been injured throughout the country, which is facing its deepest financial slump since the end of the Second World War. Trade unions in the country estimate that 484,000 people took part in the protests, some of which were deliberately violent; Class Struggle Bloc spokesman Marcus Berndt told the London Times, \u201cThe system is violent and now violence is being met by violence.\u201d Meanwhile, 700 anarchists took part in an attempt to disrupt a neo-Nazi march through Berlin while the anti-immigrant National Democratic Party was preparing a demonstration that left police wary of further violence. Overall, though, German police characterized the events as \"largely peaceful\" compared to the 2008 demonstrations.\nThe eight major French trade unions joined forces for rallies in that country, with between 65,000 and 160,000 taking to the streets in Paris in mostly peaceful protests. France has faced continued popular unrest over the economic and labor policies of President Nicolas Sarkozy, but the half-million taking part in the May 1st demonstrations are few compared to the estimated three million who rallied against Sarkozy in March. \nIndustrial action by transport workers disrupted travel throughout Greece. Police used flash grenades and tear gas to disperse demonstrators in Athens. The violent encounters were between Greek police and 300 self-described anarchist university students in Athens; 6,000 had earlier marched peacefully, with no reported arrests, through the city.\nOutside the European Union, record demonstrations also took place across Asia.\nMarchers in Istanbul, Turkey, where the government has this year agreed to make May 1st a public holiday under pressure from increasingly-influential trade unions, were pushed onto side streets by water cannons before a pitched battle between them and demonstrators broke out, with the protestors pelting the police with missiles and police responding with tear gas. No serious injuries have been reported from the demonstrations in Istanbul, but a number of arrests have taken place.\nStability in Indonesia was on the line as 8,000 demonstrated in Jakarta for the Alliance for Workers Demands. The Alliance, which groups together 33 Indonesian labor organizations, and represented 700,000 people, said through a spokesman that if the government did not listen to their demands for reform of the Indonesian employment system, they would reject the results of the upcoming elections.\nA record 12,000 turned out in Taipei, Taiwan, largely organized by labor unions; the crowd booed Taiwanese labor minister Wang Ju-hsuan as he attempted to address them from atop a van. Taiwan faces a record 5.8% unemployment rate as the financial slowdown hurts the island's export-driven economy.\nIndustrial action in India was highlighted by a one-day strike in the Malayalam film industry, which has undergone continuing wage disputes with management in the state of Kerala. A march against pay cuts and job losses were also staged in Delhi by the Indian Federation of Trade Unions\nAnd 36,000 rallied in Tokyo for Japan's 80th May Day celebration organized by the Trade Union Confederation."}

This continues the trend identified by four exclusive Wikinews reports over a four-year period exposing questionable and fraudulent edits made beginning in 2005 by Congress members or staff.\nBeginning in 2006, \"Wikinews\" reported that members of Congress or their staff were vandalizing \"Wikipedia\" by removing critical information in various articles, or adding false or offensive information. These edits were and continue to be done using computers owned or operated by the United States government.\nIn this new investigation, \"Wikinews\" has found that at least two of the three major (IP) attached to computers used by members of the U.S. House of Representatives and their staff have been the source of \"Wikipedia\" edits for several years. As recently as April 2009 they have been adding or removing false and/or offensive information from articles related to political figures or members of Congress.\nAlthough the IP addresses belong exclusively to the U.S Congress as a whole, they are linked to many different computers throughout the U.S. which are used by many different House representatives or their staff members. In response to an edit, another \"Wikipedia\" contributor posts a message on the user discussion page for the IP address, advising anyone that may view the page that the address belongs to Congress.\nIn January, one individual using a Congressional computer removed a source in an article. Five minutes later, using the same congressional IP address, someone replaced the source with an apology saying, \"sorry--House of Reps IPs should not be editing [\"Wikipedia\"], even other office's pages on lunch break.\" Despite the advisories, \"Wikinews\" has found that the individuals continued to make vandal-like edits to the encyclopedia.\nIn one instance, \"Wikinews\" found that someone with one of the IP addresses, 143.231.249.141, began to edit the \"Wikipedia\" article for , the Republican representative for . The individual began to edit on March 18, 2009 at 23:32 UTC. He or she used the official House of Representatives gateway to remove a section of information relating to inaccurate comments Austria made about . Austria stated in an interview with in February that 's in 1933 caused the U.S. to go into a depression.\n\"When Roosevelt did this, he put our country into a Great Depression. ... He tried to borrow and spend, he tried to use the Keynesian approach, and our country ended up in a Great Depression. That's just history,\" said Austria during the February 11 interview. He later admitted that his statement was wrong, saying Roosevelt's spending \"did not have the desired effect,\" which caused the depression. Exactly two minutes later on March 18, the same IP address removed information relating to bloggers accusing Austria of plagiarism in 2008. They accused him of taking credit for a column that was published in his name in the Xenia Gazette on September 2, 2008. Bloggers had discovered that the column was a direct copy of a report on the history of originally published by the U.S. . The edits were reverted, the last being over four hours after the information was removed. Despite some constructive edits, such as correcting the spelling of Wisconsin congressman 's name and correcting grammatical errors, the same IP removed the information in both sections a total of six times from March 18 to April 24, 2009.\nAfter seeing the suspicious edits, \"Wikinews\" examined the edit history for Austria's article to see if any other suspicious edits were made. After a brief search, \"Wikinews\" discovered that the IP address 65.189.244.162 removed the same information just 15 days earlier on March 3, being the first address to remove the information. Only one edit has been made to \"Wikipedia\" from that IP address so far. After tracing the address, \"Wikinews\" discovered the person who made the edits lives in or near , which is located 8.5 miles from , where Austria currently resides. Austria also grew up in which is located just 12 miles from Fairborn and only 8 miles from Beavercreek. \nAnother individual, with the IP address 75.187.63.132, also removed the allegations of plagiarism from Austria's article in February. The individual removed what they called \"Politically Motivated BS [bullshit]\" from the article of , former congresswoman for . The information was related to fundraisers between 2001 and 2004 that were held at restaurants belonging to convicted felon and former lobbyist Jack Abramoff. After tracing the IP address, \"Wikinews\" found that the edit was made from a computer located in , Ohio, the location of Pryce's offices and one of the cities in Pryce's district. \"Wikinews\" contacted Austria by e-mail for a statement, but so far there has been no response.\nFollowing those discoveries, \"Wikinews\" investigated another IP address used by the U.S. House of Representatives. On April 30, 2009, the address 143.231.249.138 made an edit that listed , the representative for California's , as being a member of the . The address also made less questionable edits, but after investigating further, it was discovered that the IP address removed critical information on April 29 from the article of , the representative for New York's . The information removed was related to a column by the the which stated that Meeks initially supported former 2008 presidential candidate Hillary Clinton over Barack Obama in the race for the . According to the Times, Meeks changed his support to Obama because he was part of \"a young black political class [which was] seeking to assert the neighborhood\u2019s power against what it sees as an older establishment, based in , that has long exercised disproportionate influence in New York City.\" \nThe address 143.231.249.138 was also responsible for adding highly biased statements to articles related to abortion. On March 16, 2009 it altered the \"Wikipedia\" article , adding that the centers were \"abortion mills, which exist only to kill people, also present themselves as medical facilities.\" On March 20, the IP changed the article to include, \"millions of women have deep regrets and, often, suffer psychological problems after undergoing an abortion--a fact the abortion industry and mass media will not admit.\" 143.231.249.141 also added racial slurs and references to pedophilia into 's article in February, saying he has \"participated in the controversial act of 'tabeling', in which he takes a small child, places him upon a table, and 'puts the lord inside him.'\"\nIn an attempt to find out where the edits were being made and by whom, \"Wikinews\" contacted the Electronic Frontier Foundation to receive advice on how to file an information request with the U.S. government under the (FOIA). The request would have been made to release the names of the individuals and offices responsible for the edits. However, according to Marcia Hofmann, a staff attorney for the EFF, who specializes in FOIA related matters, the U.S. government is not required to provide the information.\n\"None of the U.S. open government laws extends to records in the possession of members of Congress or their employees. Put differently, it's not so much a question of what the information is (identities of congressional staff) as where the information is (in congressional offices, which aren't covered by open government laws),\" said Hoffmann in an exclusive interview with \"Wikinews\". She also added that \"FOIA [requests] cover records in executive branch agencies and departments\" only.\nSuspicious and/or fraudulent edits to \"Wikipedia\" made by Congress and other government entities were first reported by \"Wikinews\" in February 2006, after the U.S. government engaged in \"Wikipedia\" vandalism and other forms of perceived biased editing of articles. The House of Representatives IP addresses were briefly banned from editing \"Wikipedia\" articles in the wake of the initial controversy. A few days later, \"Wikinews\" reported that staff members of the offices of United States Senators, using Senate-linked IP addresses, also edited \"Wikipedia\", in some cases, removing facts and sourced material from articles. In 2008, \"Wikinews\" also reported that staff members for then 2008 candidates for U.S. president Barack Obama and John McCain made questionable edits to \"Wikipedia\". "}

The chief of the WHO, Margaret Chan, told the UN General Assembly in New York that 1,003 confirmed infections have been reported throughout the world since the outbreak began.\nChan said that there was \"no indication that we are facing a situation similar to that in 1918,\" when an outbreak of the flu killed fifty million people. She did, however, warn that if the virus were to start in a second wave, it \"would be the biggest of all outbreaks the world has faced in the 21st century.\"\n\"I'm not predicting the pandemic will blow up, but if I miss it and we don't prepare, I fail. I'd rather over-prepare than not prepare,\" Chan told the Financial Times.\nOn Monday, Portugal reported its first confirmed case of the disease, in a woman who had recently visited Mexico. Other European countries, such as Britain, the Netherlands, Switzerland, and Spain, have also announced new cases of the flu. Currently, there have been 27 casualties resulting from the disease, with 26 in Mexico and the other in the United States.\nThe WHO has recently increased its pandemic alert level to the fifth level, on a scale of one to six, although it has said an increase to the highest level is not probable. Keiji Fukuda, the WHO Assistant Director, said that \"We do not have any evidence to suggest that we should move to phase six today, or any such move is imminent right now.\" A transition to the sixth level would only take place if the disease were to start spreading significantly on at least two continents.\nAndroulla Vassiliou, the European Union Health Commissioner, stressed that there was no need to panic about the outbreak. She said that a pandemic would not necessarily result in mass deaths from the virus.\n\"We are worried, but we are on top of things,\" Vassiliou said. \"The fact that we have been preparing ourselves in the EU for an event such as this for some years now, and the experience gained so far, puts us in a much stronger position.\"\nBrazil.\nThe Brazilian government has reported that there are fifteen suspected infections of the H1N1 virus, up from four earlier in the week. 44 patients displaying symptoms of the flu are being monitored.\nIn a televised interview on the weekend, Brazilian health minister Jose Gomes Temporao stated Brazil is well prepared to fight a possible epidemic. \"The virus is not circulating in the country, and if it does, we are prepared for it,\" he said, adding that the government had enough raw materials on hand to give prescriptions to up to nine million cases.\nChina.\nTens of Mexican citizens visiting China were placed under quarantine this week, despite not showing any symptoms of the swine flu, prompting allegations of discrimination from Mexican diplomats. The action was taken after a Mexican woman who had arrived in China from Mexico was found to be infected with the disease.\nChinese foreign spokesperson Ma Zhaoxu said that the move was not discrimination against Mexicans, but correct procedure. The incident has soured the two countries' relations, as Mexico is China's largest trade partner in Central America.\nMexico.\nGovernment officials in Mexico, the epicenter of the outbreak, have said that there are signs that the outbreak has been successfully curbed. Mexican health minister Jose Angel Cordova said \"the trend is slowing\". He warned against complacency, though, adding that \"there could be a resurgence, and that could occur in the next few days or even much later.\"\nThe current number of confirmed deaths from the flu have reached twelve, and 260 confirmed cases.\nThe Mexican economy has suffered from the epidemic. The government ordered tourist sites and businesses to shut down until Wednesday, after a five-day close down nationwide.

Greater Manchester has been chosen for the pilot and passport holders over sixteen will be able to submit applications for the card at post offices and pharmacies.\nA number of other high street retailers are negotiating with the government to be permitted to take photographs and fingerprints for the scheme.\nOpposition leaders stand against the planned compulsory nationwide scheme, calling for the \u00a35.3 billion programme to be scrapped. The pricetag does not include the costs that agencies and other government departments will incur procuring equipment to verify the cards.\nThe trial is also supposed to be in effect at London City and Manchester airports. This is opposed by the British Air Line Pilots Association (BALPA), claiming it is effectively compulsory; in order to get airside passes pilots will have to produce one of the new national identity cards.\nBALPA general secretary, Jim McAuslan, emphasised some of the concerns of the association's members, \"Like every other citizen, they ask themselves what will happen to the data they are coerced into providing; whether it will it \"[sic]\" be safe, whose hands might it fall into, and what might they do with the data?\" As do many of the ID card scheme's detractors, he made the Orwellian comparison, \"Our members increasingly have a sense that a line is being crossed in the relationship between state and citizen; a sense that Big Brother knows best.\"\n\"Wikinews\" contacted NO2ID about the proposal, and received feedback from their press spokesman, Michael Parker. He emphasised that this announcement is not a sure sign that the cards will actually be available later this year. Regarding the choice of post offices and chemists to serve on the front line of issuing the cards he said, \"...it totally undermines the whole idea of the project as a 'gold standard' 'unbreakable' ID card that would guarantee we are who we say we are. When any old chemist in Wythenshawe or Ancoats (Manchester districts) is responsible for collecting personal information that is supposed to be private and secure, there is a real chance for that information to be used for fraudulent purposes.\"\nNO2ID is an independent group set up to campaign against the ID card system, and what they describe as the 'database state'. When \"Wikinews\" asked if they trust the UK Government with a database of 60 million individuals' details his response was cutting and blunt, \"I would say 'Not as far as I could throw them', but then it would be easy to download 60m peoples' details onto a CD and then throw that quite far...\"\nDespite the existence of pressure groups such as NO2ID, the government asserts that there is broad public support for the introduction of compulsory ID cards."}

Nearly all of Europe's eyes are on 25 musical acts on finale night. Whether you love it or you hate it, it has your attention. Hundreds of millions are watching them. Whether viewers are waiting for the performance of a lifetime or a hilarious slip-up, for those three minutes their attention is owned by each respective singer.\nThat's the feeling that the entrants in Moscow will know on Saturday, and it's also the same feeling the eight singers who were interviewed by \"Wikinews\" have experienced. Last week, eight singers from eight different countries took time out of their various schedules to discuss their favorite moments from competing, their own personal anecdotes, advice they give to the performers this year in Moscow, who they think will win, and most importantly to them, what they're doing now and what they're offering to their audience.\nThis is the sixth and final interview set the English \"Wikinews\" will publish in the run-up to the semi-final and final rounds of the Eurovision Song Contest. conducted all interviews, and will conduct additional interviews after the Contest. The final round airs May 16 at 9 p.m. CET; check with your national broadcaster's website for possible delays. Where available, the Contest's final round will also be broadcast on national radio.\nJessica Garlick.\n What projects are you working on? What can your fan base expect to see from you this year?\nJessica Garlick: Right now I'm busy promoting my new single \"Hard Not to Fall\" which is due to be released this month...it's available to download from iTunes from 9th May, with the official release being 25th May. I'm also currently co-writing my album, which will be released later on this year. It really does feel great to be back in the music industry.\n What were some of the best memories you have from going to Eurovision? What advice would you give to the singers going to Eurovision for the first time this year?\nJessica Garlick: Some of my best memories from doing Eurovision would be visiting Estonia, I don't think it's a place I'd ever have visited if it wasn't for performing there, and it really is beautiful. While I was there during the week I had the opportunity to fly out into the Baltic Sea via helicopter and spend the afternoon on board HMS Chatham too. I was allowed to drive the frigate, and got to perform to the troops on board, who were so appreciative. \nI have so many more, and met such amazing people during the whole promotion and run-up period as well as the Eurovision week itself. My only regret is not taking as many photos as I would have liked to. So my advice to others doing Eurovision would be [to] definitely take lots of pictures, and really enjoy your performance and everything that representing your country brings with it.\n The music videos for this year are up at youtube.com/eurovision. Which songs are your favorites and which country do you think has the best chance of winning?\nJessica Garlick: I have been fortunate enough to have been able to perform alongside some of this year's Eurovision entries, and was totally impressed! I \"love\" the Iceland entry this year...the song \"Is it True?\" is a really beautiful ballad, and Johanna sings it really well! I would say that from a song point of view, this is definitely my favourite song. \nI do, however, think that the Ukraine could win this year! Svetlana's performance is \"crazy\"!! She's absolutely wild! Her live performance is out of control! She is definitely \"in it to win it\", and is going all out to ensure she does everything to make this happen. She is one to watch on the night for sure! There will definitely be something amazing going on on stage during her performance. She'll keep you captivated, and make it memorable!!\n\"' A lot of the fans you had from when you were on \"Pop Idol\" and Eurovision 2002 don't know the reason why you dropped out of music and out of sight. What happened? Also, do you find it difficult returning to the music industry after being away for six years?\nJessica Garlick: After Pop Idol and Eurovision I started to write songs...something I had never done before, and didn't think I would be any good at. But I have been fortunate enough to travel the world since, co-writing with some of the world's best songwriters. I decided to take a step out of the industry for a while in 2004 when I got married to my teenage sweetheart Owen. \nI lost my passion for music for a while if I'm honest and we wanted to travel together for a bit, and actually moved to Australia for a short time, before I got totally broody. So in 2007 I gave birth to my little girl Olivia, and have been doing the wife and at-home mummy thing since, which I absolutely \"love\"!! \nI made the decision to get back in the studio and start writing again in January of this year and it felt so good, and when I recorded \"Hard Not to Fall\" I knew it was a song that I wanted everyone to hear, and I completely got my passion and drive back for it. The music industry has changed a lot since I was last in it...but in actual fact it's working better for me this time. \nI have a lot more control, which is important to me, especially with Olivia being my main priority...I am first and foremost a mum, and I want to be a good one at that, and I'm also working with people that I really like and trust, which makes working together fun, and music should be fun. It's definitely a lot harder this time around, as I am juggling \"real life\" too, and I can't afford to be the selfish person that being successful in the industry can sometimes mean you have to be. I'm having the most wonderful time being back though, and am almost astounded by the great support I have from all my old fans. They're the best!!\nAni Lorak.\n What projects are you working on? What can your fan base expect to see from you this year?\nAni Lorak: I've just released my new album called \"Sontse\" (\"The Sun\"). The album was written and recorded in Greece at the \"VOX studio\" by Dimitris Kontopoulos, who also helped with the song \"Shady Lady\" for Eurovision 2008. The album will be released not only in Ukraine but also in Russia. \nIn the autumn I plan to start a large tour of 25 cities in support of the new album. Also, we are planning to play some solo concerts in the Palace \"Ukraine\" in Kiev. I was pleasantly surprised when, at the beginning of the year, an award came to my office from the British radio station \"Eurovision Song Contest Radio.\" By audience vote, its listeners named me the \"Best Female Singer for 2008\" for my song \"Shady Lady.\" I don't like to think ahead and to anticipate, but I'll try to do as much as my energies will allow so people can be fulfilled in the future.\n What were some of the best memories you have from going to Eurovision? What advice would you give to the singers going to Eurovision for the first time this year?\nAni Lorak: Because I participated in the contest only in 2008, I can remember it all: during the promotional tour I visited many countries in which I hadn't been before. I met wonderful people: Dimitris Kontopoulos, Roberto Cavalli; I made new friends and supporters. \"[Editor's note: Roberto Cavalli designed the diamond dress Ani Lorak wore during her Eurovision performance.]\" I had to work very diligently to get the result [I got]. \nIn Eurovision I found the heart of this contest. The \"Artistic Award\", which [they] usually hand to the best artist of the contest, [was given to me]; Raffaella Carr\u00e0 invited me to her television program in Italy, and my tours took me further and further away geographically. I really liked the atmosphere of [the] contest. All the contestants were friendly, happy, helped each other, and supported one another. Those weeks were not simple, but very happy in my life. \nI wish to all the participants lots of inspiration, tenacity, crazy energy, hard work and belief in yourself and your strength. It is not unachievable; the main thing is to settle for being frank and sincere to the audience.\n The music videos for this year are up at youtube.com/eurovision. Which songs are your favorites and which country do you think has the best chance of winning?\nAni Lorak: I can say one thing \u2013 Eurovision is a very unpredictable contest, and to do any predictions is very difficult. I know that in Moscow this year there will be many very well-known professional artists: Sakis Rouvas and Patricia Kaas. The main thing in this contest is to enter the scene and present for your country 200%. I wish good luck to all participants, but I'll root, as a patriot, for my country.\n What goals have you not achieved yet in your career, but would like to eventually?\nAni Lorak: We have a proverb: \"If you want God to laugh, then tell Him about your plans.\" It\u2019s important to have enough strength for my professional accomplishments, for my career, and for my eventual creative achievements. But all this must go together with my personal life. I want to realize my self-worth in all spheres. Maybe I\u2019ll open my own clothing line.\nBut most importantly for me, every day I will raise the bar with regard to my professional development as a singer and artist. The main point \u2013 I have everything ahead of me, and I will go to [any lengths to] achieve my dreams \u2014 my Oscar is yet to come!\nMarie N.\n What projects are you working on? What can your fan base expect to see from you this year?\nMarie N: At this time I am a student at acting school in Paris, so now all [my] plans are more about theatre, but I also started to work on my new album and I hope that at the end of the year I [can] present that to [the] audience, but I think that at the moment it's too early to talk about it. \"[smile]\"\n What were some of the best memories you have from going to Eurovision? What advice would you give to the singers going to Eurovision for the first time this year?\nMarie N: I liked everything during the week we spent there. We really had a lot of fun. The [atmosphere] was very professional, participants were very friendly...but the most emotional [part] was our trip back home \u2013 the way from Tallinn to Riga by bus with the police accompanying us and people waiting for us with flowers along the road...\nThe only advice is \"to enjoy\" every moment and especially the three minutes of the presentation \u2013 it is really something special. \"[smile]\"\n The music videos for this year are up at youtube.com/eurovision. Which songs are your favorites and which country do you think has the best chance of winning?\nMarie N: I think that there are a lot of songs which have chances to win, but it depends on the energy that [the] singers will bring with them [to] the stage on that special evening.\n Which task was more fun for you, winning Eurovision or hosting it the next year? Which one made you more nervous, and why?\nMarie N: Of course singing was more fun than the hosting because you are responsible only for yourself, but hosting brings a responsibility for the whole show. I wish all the best for all the participants; enjoy. \"[smile]\"\nNiels \"Noller\" Olsen.\n What projects are you working on? What can your fan base expect to see from you this year?\nNiels Olsen: We are working on a new album and we will make a small tour to Sweden, Norway and Denmark for the rest of the year, so that's what our fans can expect. The album will be released in 2010.\n What were some of the best memories you have from going to Eurovision? What advice would you give to the singers going to Eurovision for the first time this year?\nNiels Olsen: The best memory...well, it's hard to say...we had a lot of fantastic memories from Stockholm in 2000. We will never forget the love we received from the public in all the European countries right after Stockholm, and the response from the Swedish people at the event. Apropos, I said to my brother after the first performance, \"Well, J\u00f8rgen, I think it could be possible for us to have a hit in Sweden!!\"\nI would say to a \"new\" artist: Remember that you are not the center of the universe, and in a world perspective, the situation is not that bad if you lose the Eurovision. Stick to the ones you love and try to involve people you believe in, not the ones who promise you everything in life. In our case we have had the same manager for 35 years, we have been working with our friend and producer Stig Kreutzfeldt for 25 years, and so on. We have [made] several hits the last 35 years with these fantastic friends.\n The music videos for this year are up at youtube.com/eurovision. Which songs are your favorites and which country do you think has the best chance of winning?\nNiels Olsen: Well, I haven't heard all the songs, but I personally find the Danish, the English, and the Swedish songs very nice, but as I [said], I haven't heard all the songs yet.\n The Danish version of your winning song implies women \"get better with age.\" Which women in the entertainment industry do you think personify that sentiment, and why?\nNiels Olsen: Personally I think my wife is still a beautiful woman, but I think as you said \"getting better with age\" is not the right word. My wife is still a lively and attractive woman, and we are both in love with life. I also think that a woman like Annie Lennox is a beautiful woman, even though she is past 50. (Sorry, [I know] we don't talk about a woman's age normally. Sorry, Miss Lennox.)\nHanna Pakarinen.\n What projects are you working on? What can your fan base expect to see from you this year?\nHanna Pakarinen: I released my fourth album \"Love in a Million Shades\" earlier this year, and now I'm doing gigs around Finland.\n What were some of the best memories you have from going to Eurovision? What advice would you give to the singers going to Eurovision for the first time this year?\nHanna Pakarinen: I think the best memory is the moment when I got up on stage in the finals. That was amazing! \nIt's hard to give any advice, but I think the only thing that's important is just to be yourself and have fun. \"[smile]\"\n The music videos for this year are up at youtube.com/eurovision. Which songs are your favorites and which country do you think has the best chance of winning?\nHanna Pakarinen: Of course I think the best song is the Finnish song. \"[smile]\" It's very hard to say who is going to win; it's the same thing every year, you never know! \n Apart from music, what are some things that are very close to your heart? How would you like to use your popularity to help others?\nHanna Pakarinen: My family and friends, of course, and my hometown and the lake there. \nI'm not really a big fan of the idea of being a role model but I'm trying to do my best, showing and telling the fans that the most important thing is to love yourself and be who you are. And always trust yourself, of course!\nCharlotte Perrelli.\n What projects are you working on? What can your fan base expect to see from you this year?\nCharlotte Perrelli: I'm searching for new songs to [include on] my upcoming album. I\u00b4m also on the jury for the Swedish TV show \"Talang\" (\"Talent; the Swedish version of the \"___'s Got Talent!\" TV series\"). They can expect a new album, hopefully this year.\n You went to Eurovision twice, winning the Contest in 1999 and then also entering last year. What were some of the best memories you had from both times you went to Eurovision? \nCharlotte Perrelli: The victory in Jerusalem in '99 was fantastic, of course. My funniest memory was when Dana [International] fell on-stage, it was unbelievable and I felt sorry for her. Last year I had a lot of memories. Everything was so different from '99. So much bigger!\n The music videos for this year are up at youtube.com/eurovision. Which songs are your favorites and which country do you think has the best chance of winning?\nCharlotte Perrelli: I like many of the songs this year, but I believe Norway will win.\n Which of the songs you've recorded is your favorite? \nCharlotte Perrelli: Hmm. I have many favorites, but \"Black and Blue\" from my last CD is a great song; [it was] written by Fredrik Kempe. I love the lyrics.\nSirusho.\n What projects are you working on? What can your fan base expect to see from you this year?\nSirusho: I am currently working on a few big projects, one of them is the new song\n\"Time to Pray\" that I have made with my colleagues from Eurovision, Boaz Mauda and Jelena Tomasevic. The song is a protest against war, and the English lyrics are written by the President of Israel, Shimon Peres. I am also working on my fourth album which will be released in [the] summer. I also premiered my new song in Greek, \"Erotas\", and it is already number one [on] all the Armenian music charts. My fans are very strong and it's only a pleasure to work hard for them.\n What were some of the best memories you have from going to Eurovision? What advice would you give to the singers going to Eurovision for the first time this year?\nSirusho: Eurovision is a big fun festival. I don't want to call it a competition, because the contestants become friends. I wish for the participants to really enjoy [themselves] and not be scared of it. Eurovision can give and take so much; it took my career to a new level, [and] now I work and have fans all over Europe and it's amazing.\n The music videos for this year are up at youtube.com/eurovision. Which songs are your favorites and which country do you think has the best chance of winning?\nSirusho: I have met some of this year's participants in different countries where I was singing as a guest and they were doing their promo tours. I haven't seen all the performances so I can't judge. Also, Eurovision is all about unexpected surprises; that's what makes it interesting.\n You pursued a bachelor's degree in international relations. How do you wish to utilize your degree? If you had to stop singing tomorrow, what kind of career would you want to pursue with the degree you hold?\nSirusho: International affairs is something that had interested me. I like to learn. I always tend to learn more but I don't even want to think about stopping my career. I was born with it, it's a big part of who I am, and even if something happens to my vocal cords, I can go on with writing and producing songs for my colleagues...[but] enough about that; I still have so much in me to give to my\naudience!\nTaj\u010di.\n What projects are you working on? What can your fans in both America and in Europe expect to see from you this year?\nTaj\u010di: Apart from my regular tours, which I do four a year, I am working on a show called \"Need a Break,\" which is a bit of a step from my spiritual music and more \"everyday.\" It's more what mothers go through, with marriage and kids. It's a funny show. What I do well is I tell stories. It's how I am. It's who I am. It's why pop music didn't work for me as an artist. This new format is great for me, it's very fulfilling and I'm very excited and looking forward to it, being able to do that and explore musical styles.\nI'm also hoping to go to Zagreb this year and bring my new music to them. I think it's time. I've been away for 17 years, and they still play my old music, and occasionally I go there and do radio and television interviews...I don't know, it's time for them to see what I'm doing. Anyone can see my stuff online, but what I do best is live; there's a lot of energy and power there that you can't really see in a recording or in a video. It's different when you're actually in the room. I want to bring it to them and say, \"Here, my countrymen, my old fans, this is who I am now. This is how I grew over the last 17 years.\" Kind of like a reunion.\n What were some of the best memories you have from going to Eurovision? What advice would you give to the singers going to Eurovision for the first time this year?\nTaj\u010di: I really enjoyed performing, I enjoyed the energy, everyone coming together and singing, talking with other people about their careers. That was the highlight. I didn't care for the press or the competition aspect, but there's so much to think about, the whole country is looking at you. I don't think it could ever be just about music, it's more political. But there's always stuff that comes with it when you have any kind of gathering like that.\nThe time I was there, I was the last representative before the fall of Yugoslavia, and it was during the unification of Europe, and everyone was a bit more tense and elevated in that regard...and I was so young to experience all of that. I don't think I knew what to quite make of it. But it was a great experience, I'll always remember it. The night of my life, one of them anyway.\nIt's also very emotional because the singer who won that year sang about \"unite unite, Europe.\" It was perfect at that time. After he won, in the green room, he pulled a red rose from the bouquet and gave it to me, and he paid me some compliments. For a 19-year-old girl, that meant a lot.\nMy advice is to have fun, and do it with all your heart. Don't do it for the sole reason to win, not to launch your career, but because you love it, and it's what you do and you're good at it. You can be an inspiration to someone and it can be more than just providing entertainment.\n The music videos for this year are up at http://www.youtube.com/eurovision . Which songs are your favorites and which country do you think has the best chance of winning?\nTaj\u010di: Since we're in the middle of a tour, I kind of scrolled through, and I think the quality of the songs are really wonderful. I feel like I want to pack my bags and go to Europe for the summer, because I think this is going to be a summer for some great club music!\nI'm partial to countries [who sing] in their original language, and I can see how a lot of countries, how even when they do the dance number and include ethnic elements, I like that.\nI like the guy from Norway, I think he's so sincere and didn't look to me like he was \"trying\" anything, he was just being himself. The song is nice and happy. It doesn't hurt that he's really handsome, and has a good aura about him. He had so much energy, and he grabbed me right away, the way he moved, the way he sang, it just pulled me in. \nI also love Malta, I'm a fan of the big ballads. She has a beautiful voice. And Cyprus, she \"did it\" for me too. I also like the French song as well, but I also love the French language in general. Bosnia has a good song too, they have a certain sentiment that they always pull from and it works for them. Croatia, I wasn't too blown away, but I'm proud of them for still singing in Croatian, even though it may not sound as pretty as English to some people. Everything else, it was like, \"It's beautiful, but I've seen it before.\"\nEverything seems like Hollywood now, I guess because it's the times we live in now. All the girls are so pretty and the hair and makeup are perfect, and now I feel like an old lady, but I miss the characters from different parts of the world. It's influenced so much by Hollywood and the Western music industry. It was inevitable, the melting of it [East and West] all into one, so I'm partial to bringing some sort of local element into it. It comes with finding your identity and finding your place in the world as a country.\nI volunteer and give my time to a local school and teach the schoolchildren ethnic dances. I live in the Midwest now, but I used to live in Los Angeles and New York where they are a little more aware of ethnic groups. I'm teaching them these dances to give them a little sense of what's being lost to the new kinds of culture and music. I teach some kids who were adopted from other countries, and I wonder, wow, are they ever going to be able to sing a song in Bulgarian, or Italian, or what have you?\nMy kids are half-American and half-Croatian, and I see how in my own life, being \"globalized\" and how people are losing the ethnic folklore and culture and all that, so with my kids, I try to teach them language and how to dance, because it's the way I grew up.\n I watched a clip of your documentary on YouTube, and I noticed one of the comments, asking you \"not to forget your home, Croatia,\" and to come back because the fans there miss you. Now that you've made a life for yourself in America, do you ever see yourself moving back to Croatia with your family? Which country do you feel more ties and loyalty to, the United States or Croatia, and why?\nTaj\u010di: I want to take the kids and at least spend a year there when they're teenagers, so I can show them my country and so they can learn different things there. But I don't know, once you leave, it's hard to go back. I miss my country, I miss the history. I miss my roots. I miss running into a friend and talking about high school and grade school, stuff that you don't have when you move away. I love what I do, and I love what America has to offer, and what America did offer to me. There's a certain kind of freedom that you have that you can't have in a smaller country.\nI will always be Croatian, it doesn't matter how long I stay here. When I go home to Croatia, when I go there, I feel like I'm home, but when I come back to America, I feel like I'm home here too. I guess I have to say that a person can be \"home\" anywhere if they have peace within themselves. You're gonna miss a lot of things about places you have been, and I do miss Croatia. I want to show my kids where I grew up and the parks where I played. That just may be a sentiment I'm going through right now, I don't know. I have a good life, my husband and kids, and I love being able to make the kind of music I want to, without any contracts or obligations. I'm very happy."}

She died from infection caused by severe eczema after they shunned effective conventional medical treatments for homeopathy, a form of alternative medicine that has been described as pseudoscience. Articles in peer-reviewed academic journals including \"Social Science &amp; Medicine\" have characterized homeopathy as a form of quackery.\nGloria developed severe eczema at the age of four months and the parents were advised to send the child to a skin specialist. Thomas Sam, a practising homeopath, instead decided to treat his daughter himself. His daughter's condition deteriorated, to the point that the baby spent all her energy battling the infections caused by the constant breaking of the skin, leading to severe malnutrition and, eventually, her death. By the end, Gloria's eczema was so severe that her skin broke every time her parents changed her clothes or nappy, and in the words of the Crown prosecutor, Mark Tedeschi, QC, \"Gloria spent a lot of the last five months of her life crying, irritable, scratching and the only thing that gave her solace was to suck on her mother's breast.\" Gloria also became unable to move her legs.\nMr. Tedeschi also told the court that, over the last five months of her life, \"Gloria's eczema played a devastating role in her overall health and it is asserted by the Crown that both her parents knew this and discussed it with each other.\" However, despite their child's severe illness, and her lack of improvement, the Sams continued to shun conventional medical treatment, instead seeking help from other homeopaths and naturopaths. Gloria temporarily improved during the rare times they used conventional treatments, but they soon dropped them in favour of homeopathy, and she consistently worsened.\nAllegedly, Thomas' sister pleaded with him to send Gloria to a conventional medical doctor, but he replied \"I am not able to do that\". The parents are also accused of putting their social life ahead of their child, taking her on a trip to India and leaving her to servants while embarking on a busy social schedule, and giving her homeopathic drops instead of using the prescription creams they had been given.\nGloria was finally taken to the emergency department shortly before her death. By this time, \"her skin was weeping, her body malnourished and her corneas melting\", according to the Sydney Morning Herald. \nSpeaking in the parents' defense, Tom Molomby, SC, said that, as the parents came from India, where homeopathy is in common use, they should be declared not guilty due to cultural differences.\nHomeopathy is a form of alternative medicine which treats patients with massively diluted forms of substances that, if given to a healthy person undiluted, would cause symptoms similar to the disease. Typical treatments take the dilutions, with ritualised shaking between each step of the dilution, past the level where any molecules of the original substance are likely to remain; for homeopathic treatments to work, basic well-understood concepts in chemistry and physics would have to be wrong. There is no evidence that homeopathy is more effective than placebo for any condition."}

Ramirez waived his right to challenge the suspension.\nSaid Ramirez: \"Recently I saw a physician for a personal health issue.

On Thursday, Robertson compared its legalization to pedophilia, polygamy and child molestation while hosting the television show \"The 700 Club\" on the Christian Broadcasting Network.\nDuring the broadcast Robertson asked \"How can we rule that polygamy is illegal when you say that homosexual marriage is legal? What is it about polygamy that\u2019s different? Well, polygamy was outlawed because it was considered immoral according to biblical standards. But if we take biblical standards away in homosexuality, what about the other? And what about bestiality and ultimately what about child molestation and pedophilia?\"\nRobertson then went on to query, \"How can we criminalize these things and at the same time have constitutional amendments allowing same-sex marriage among homosexuals. You mark my words, this is just the beginning in a long downward slide in relation to all the things that we consider to be abhorrent.\"\nRobertson's comments come after the Council of the District of Columbia voted in favor to recognize same-sex marriages performed anywhere outside the District. The measure passed the council 12 votes for with 1 against. Congress has 30 days post-signing to either let it stand or veto. D.C. is not a state and Congress has oversight of the Council. \n\"To say 'well, I support domestic partnership or I support civil union' as a way to say 'I'm not that big a bigot,' and that's what it is,\" said David Catania, an openly gay member of the D.C. council.\nRobertson's comments have made headlines in the past. In August of 2005, Robertson called for the assassination of Venezuelan President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, for which he apologized two days later. In January 2006, Robertson said that former Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's stroke was \"divine retribution\" for pulling Israelis out of the Gaza Strip."}

The settlement stipulates that in the event of a shortfall, victims will receive funds in the form of installments.\nAsbestos advocacy groups representing injured former employees are requesting help from the Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd for additional funds from James Hardie. \"We're talking to the government and James Hardie about funding options,\" said Dallas Booth, CEO of Asbestos Injuries Compensation Fund.\n\"For example victims might be able to sign over their rights to the state government so that they get compensated in full until the fund can be replenished and then the state government can get their money back straight out of the fund.\" suggested Paul Bastian, New South Wales secretary of the Australian Manufacturing Workers Union .\nBarry Robson, president of the Asbestos Diseases Foundation explained that James Hardie has paid $153 million in taxes to the Australian Taxation Office, and that the Asbestos Diseases Foundation will request of the Rudd Government to defer these taxes until the economic condition improves and James Hardie's profitability returns. In this way the Australian government would allow James Hardie's taxes to go to the asbestos fund. \nVictims are currently paid out via a lump sum arrangement, and the Asbestos Diseases Foundation is advocating for the status quo. \"Well how they're paid now is in lump sum and we'd like to continue with that. The victims groups are totally opposed to any instalment plan whatsoever,\" said Robson in the interview with \"PM\".\nThe Asbestos Diseases Foundation emphasized that a payment plan could be ineffectual, as asbestos victims and those suffering from mesothelioma may die before receiving full payments.\nBastian noted to the Australian Associated Press that asbestos victims have upfront costs to deal with, including medical bills, and would be adversely affected by an installment plan option. \"Victims also want to ensure that their families are looked after, that there's contingencies and everything is settled before they pass away, in many cases,\" said Bastian to the AAP.\nBastian told \"The Australian\" he would request Prime Minister Rudd stay true to his promise that \"no one would go without compensation\". \"I think the state Government should be our white knight,\" commented Bastian. \nAsbestosis is a disease resulting from asbestos exposure which causes lung scarring and can lead to lung cancer. Exposure to asbestos can also lead to a more serious condition known as mesothelioma. Mesothelioma is a cancer which develops in the sac surrounding the lungs and chest cavity, abdominal cavity, or the sac surrounding the heart. Patients with malignant mesothelioma generally do not have positive outcomes, and once diagnosed typically have six months to a year to live. "}

The group then murdered Abeer as well as her younger sister and both parents. The gang then burnt down the family house in Mahmudiya to try to cover up their crimes.\nThe other four men were court martialed as they were still soldiers when they were charged. Most are now serving multiple life sentences after three confessed and the fourth was convicted. Green was honorably discharged from the US Army after medics diagnosed him with a psychiatric disorder and described as having \"homicidal tendencies\" before authorities learned of his involvement in the rape and murders.\nSpc. James P. Barker and Sgt. Paul E. Cortez are serving 90 and 100 year sentences respectively after confessing, while Pfc. Jesse V. Spielman received a 110 year sentence after his conviction. Pfc. Bryan L. Howard, who did not know of the planned crimes before their commission and remained at a checkpoint while the offenses were committed, received a 27-month sentence. Charges were dropped against Sgt. Anthony Yribe, who was honorably discharged.\nGreen, who set the teen's body alight and bragged about his crimes, is facing a possible death sentence.

Calder\u00f3n then uploaded the map to the Internet making it publicly available for researchers around the world. The President commented on the research being a step towards population-specific predictive medicine and medications, and particularly useful for Latin America for being genetically closer to the Mestizo peoples of those countries than genome maps published so far.\nAmong other results, the five year-long work found that, while sharing the 99.9% of the genome common to all humans, in the remaining portion the Mexican population has significant genetic variation from the world's other known genetic subgroups. This makes importing genome maps from other groups unfeasible, and hence justifies the study.\nAlso, by comparing with data sets from the HapMap Project (a map of the human genome's haplotypes, which are clusters of the possible genetic variations a human individual can present), it was found that Mexicans share 64% of their haplotypes with West Africans, 74% with East Asians and 81% with Northern Europeans.\nGenetic analyses aimed at common disorders in Mexico like diabetes, obesity and breast cancer are yet to be performed. \"With a drop of saliva we would be able to tell whether to prescribe a medication or not\", forecast Jim\u00e9nez about the applications of the genome map in the long run.\n\"Studies such as this are helping us define the future of the genome era\", commented U.S. Translational Genomics Research Institute President Jeffrey Trent. \"Gaining a clearer understanding of how genetic variation plays a role in disease, including the risk to some infections, will help tip the scales in our favour in terms of understanding and treating disease at the individual level\", he added.\n\"It is not possible today to say genetic variation is responsible for the unique H1N1 Influenza A mortality rate in Mexico. However, knowledge of genomic variability in the Mexican population can allow the identification of genetic variations that confer susceptibility to common diseases, including infections such as the flu\", said Jim\u00e9nez when talking about the current swine flu outbreak.\nRecently, however, Inmegen's Multifactorial Diseases Genomic Research Laboratory head Lorena Orozco revealed that one fifth of the Mexican population have genes in their immune system that can trigger an immune overreaction in presence of some diseases. According to Orozco one of these genes is responsible for symptoms similar to the ones A/H1N1 victims presented, which makes it a strong candidate for explaining these deaths.\nAlthough blood samples were collected from 10 different states and 4 Amerindian populations, the published results are based on data from only 6 states and 1 Amerindian population. The presentation ceremony and the online publication of the research paper in the PNAS journal came just days after the Mexican Government came under criticism for its low investment in science and the resulting dependency on other countries in the beginning of the current sanitary crisis."}

The two telescopes valued at \u20ac1.9 billion (\u00a31.7bn) were launched from Kourou, French Guiana, a department of France in South America.\n\"The technology onboard these satellites is unique, and the science these satellites will do is fantastic,\" said Jean-Jacques Dordain director-general at the ESA, \"This is the result of many years' hard work by thousands of scientists and engineers across Europe.\" \nHerschel was released 26 minutes after launch to continue on its trajectory. Two minutes later, the Planck observatory separated. The Planck telescope is a survey telescope using Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) measurements of the microwave portion of the electromagnetic spectrum.\n\"It [Planck] will allow us to pin down all the basic characteristics of the Universe with very high accuracy - its age, its contents, how it evolved, its geometry, etc.\" said Dr Jan Tauber, project scientist at ESA.\nThe larger space telescope is named after William Herschel who discovered the planet Uranus in 1781. The Herschel telescope will use infrared radiation and its main reflector mirror at a diameter of 3.5 meter (11.5 ft) is one-and-a-half-times larger than that on the Hubble Telescope.\nThe Heterodyne Instrument for the Far Infrared (HIFI) will also be able to detect carbon, water and oxygen in star-forming areas of space and examine the chemical composition of comets. The Photodetector Array Camera (PACS) and Spectrometer and the Spectral and Photometric Imaging Receiver (SPIRE) will correlate the images. The Herschel will also be equipped with heat detecting instrumentation. The Herschel space telescope will be operational for three to five years. \n\"These space missions are outstanding feats of engineering. Herschel is the largest telescope we have ever put into space and the instruments on Planck will operate at just a tenth of a degree above absolute zero,\" said Lord Drayson, the United Kingdom's science minister, \"This is really cool science happening at mind-blowingly low temperatures, helping to answer some of the basic questions about the history of the universe.\"\n\"Herschel is going to help us understand much, much better how stars form right now and how they have been forming throughout billions of years of cosmic history\" said G\u00f6ran Pilbratt, Herschel's project scientist at ESA, \"We're going to see the [star] embryos, the ones that are not born yet.

RTVE ran a professional tennis match, the Madrid Open matchup between Fernando Verdasco and Juan M\u00f3naco, an hour past schedule Thursday evening, delaying the Eurovision semi-final broadcast and disenfranchising the Spanish viewers ready to vote for their favorite songs.\nSpain, as a top monetary contributor to the EBU, automatically qualifies for the final but Spanish viewers were allowed to cast votes for one of the two semi-final rounds, as were the other automatic qualifiers (the United Kingdom, France, Germany, and host nation Russia).\nThe scheduling delay is in violation of the rules set forth to the national broadcasters by the EBU, and punishment could range from a fine incurred by RTVE to complete disqualification for Spain, who was slated to have Soraya perform her song \"La noche es para m\u00ed\" 25th and last in the final Saturday evening. \nThe newspaper \"El Mundo\" speculated that the delay might have occurred on purpose, as RTVE may not want to take the task of hosting the event in 2010 in the event that Spain wins. \"El Mundo\" also remarked that the EBU could take a harsher stance toward RTVE if they deem it a case of \"voter fraud,\" as the disenfranchisement of Spanish televoters, replaced with a backup jury, would have changed the result of qualifying nations. In any case, the EBU is the governing body which decides if the delay was intentional or not and what punishments should be given to RTVE for breaking Contest rules.\nWhen asked for comment by the newspaper \"ABC\", RTVE cited \"technical difficulties\" but did not elaborate further. According to \"ABC\", RTVE's teletext service had announced that the live broadcast would start at 9:45 p.m., 45 minutes after the broadcast started in Moscow, but neither RTVE's website nor its continuity announcements had made note of any change. The Eurovision broadcast started transmission from the beginning on RTVE's \"La 2\" channel at 10:06 p.m., 66 minutes late.\nNo public statement has yet been made by the EBU; the EBU went ahead with the scheduled press conference for the ten semi-final winners Thursday evening.

Norway's neighbor Sweden was especially happy on Constitution Day, where Norwegian-Swedes dressed in folk costumes and held up copies of the newspaper \"Expressen\", who deemed Norway's winning Eurovision song \"the best winner since ABBA\" and published a large headline in Norwegian, stating \"We look forward with you.\"\nConstitution Day will end with Norway's new national hero Rybak, deemed \"Alexander the Great\" in the Norwegian newspapers, arriving at Oslo's Gardermoen airport at 9:25 p.m. local time (1925 UTC). Record crowds are expected to greet him, as he invited everyone via state television to the airport for his trip home."}

Most national newspapers congratulated their entrants on a job well done, while others trash-talked other entrants, and still others called for their countries to pull out of the Contest. \nHere are some interviews, articles and opinions that made it to the front pages of newspapers and to their sanctioned blogs.\nNorway.\nNorway's mass media was filled with stories revolving around the winner, Alexander Rybak, but a secondary story that received press coverage was outcry against NRK's Eurovision commentator, Synn\u00f8ve Svab\u00f8, who was criticized for talking incessantly during the event, making leering comments regarding the contents inside the male entrants' tight pants, and making a joke about stuffing sweatsocks in her own bra. When asked for a statement by \"Aftenposten\", Svab\u00f8 said, \"I guess people think I should have put the socks in my throat.\" NRK did not comment on Svab\u00f8's commentating or whether she will be returning next year.\nSweden.\nSweden's newspaper \"Aftonbladet\" wrote that the \"Swede of the evening\" was not Sweden's entrant Malena Ernman, but Malm\u00f6-raised Arash Labaf, one of the two singers placing third for Azerbaijan. Markus Larsson wrote, \"21st place? Well, this is our second-worst result ever...Malena Ernman fell so far and deep that she almost ended up in Finland. That is to say, almost last.\" When asked if she was disappointed, Ernman responded, \"No, but I am sorry if the Swedes are disappointed.\" She went on to quip, \"Europe is simply not ready for my high notes.\" \nFinland.\nFinland, despite placing last, wrote upbeat stories; \"Helsingin Sanomat\" published an interview with Waldo and Karoliina from the Finnish act, Waldo's People, who announced how happy they were to have participated and will be going right back to work with performances and recordings as soon as they return to Finland.\nUnited Kingdom.\nMost British newspapers in past years published lengthy screeds regarding their bad luck in the Contest and whether they should send an entrant at all. This year all that talk subsided, and newspapers published articles congratulating Jade Ewen on her fifth place ranking. Sir Terry Wogan, former Eurovision commentator for the BBC, said to the \"Daily Express\" about this year's voting overhaul, \"I think my protest about the voting was totally vindicated by the changes that were made to the scoring this year. It made a real difference. It was the change that Eurovision needed.\" One of the headlines in Monday's \"Daily Mail\" reads: \"She did us proud.\" Andrew Lloyd Webber, who worked with Ewen, said, \"Jade performed brilliantly. After years of disappointing results, the UK can finally hold its head high.\"\nSpain.\nSpain's newspaper \"El Mundo\" published an article entitled \"Soraya's fiasco,\" outlining Soraya Arnelas's failure to receive points from 37 of the 41 other voting nations, with the writer remarking, \"After a whole year trying to forget [Rodolfo Chikilicuatre, Spain's \"joke entrant\" from 2008], Soraya jumped on-stage with strength...Spain's experiment ended with longing [for] Rodolfo Chikilicuatre.\" When asked about her performance and the result, Arnelas said, \"I'll hang on to the experiences I had, the great friends that I made and I'm happy because now I'm known in Europe.\"\nFrance.\nFrench newspapers and blogs were muted compared to other countries, but the overall feeling was still very supportive of Patricia Kaas, who placed eighth. In an interview with \"Le Figaro\", Kaas said, \"Eighth place, that's not so bad. It was a great moment for France, we held our head high.\" \"France Soir\" noted, \"[Kaas's] emotion does not seem to have found a place with competitors that have relied on heavy artillery choreography worthy of those like Shakira, and glamorous outfits, to ensure a place on the podium.\"\nGermany.\nGerman newspapers published lengthy stories analyzing why Germany was in the bottom quartile for the third straight year. \"Die Welt\" wrote, \"The Germans have become accustomed to it: winning the Eurovision Song Contest just does not work [for us]. [Compared] to the total failure of last place with No Angels last year, [this] result is almost a sensational success.\" \"Bild\" commented, \"For years we have had little success. Germany's placement, despite all efforts, will not be better. Why are we still participating in the Eurovision Song Contest?\"\nIreland.\nIreland, who failed to make it to the final, led the cry to pull out of Eurovision. In the \"Irish Independent,\" Ian O'Doherty wrote, \"Ireland managed something quite rare and rather gratifying last week -- we actually managed to produce a Eurovision song that didn't make you want to rip off your own eyelids so you could stuff them in your ears to stop the horrible sounds...[Sin\u00e9ad] Mulvey's elimination is proof of one thing: we need to pull out of this pile of rubbish as soon as possible.\"\nThe Netherlands.\nThe Netherlands, another nation that did not make it past the semi-final round, has been very apathetic toward the Contest in recent years, and this year was no different. \"De Telegraaf\" conducted an opinion poll of Dutch television viewers, and 90% of them believed the Netherlands should not enter the Contest anymore. Despite the stated apathy, 2.5 million Dutch viewers watched De Toppers compete in the second semi-final, an improvement of 800,000 from last year's semi-final, where Dutch entrant Hind also failed to advance. De Toppers singer Gordon, in an interview with \"De Telegraaf\", said that the Netherlands should continue to compete: \"One time, we will succeed.\"\nWho said what about whom?\nApart from judging themselves, the newspapers throughout Europe were eager to throw sarcastic quips and insults at the other songs. Here are some of the highlights from different countries. \n __NOEDITSECTION__"}

In it, Mohamed Kohail pleads with the prime minister to utilise \"every way possible to get me out of this situation.\" \nKohail, 23, of Montreal, was sentenced on March 3, 2008 to be publicly executed following a confession for murder at a Saudi school. Kohail claims the confession was obtained under duress. The Saudi Supreme Court advised the lower court on April 9, 2009 to renounce the death penalty; however, the request was refused.\nMunzer Al-Hiraki, 19, was killed in an after-school fight in January 2007, allegedly after Kohail's brother, Sultan, insulted a girl. The brothers claim that the fight involved a large group of boys, and felt they were acting in self defense.\nSultan, 16 at the time, said that Mohamed came to his rescue with a friend, only to be greeted by a group armed with knives and clubs. Witnesses for the brothers say that Al-Hiraki had arrived at the school with carloads of friends to seek vengeance on Sultan. \n\"I was tortured to sign a confession. I was misinformed that I would be allowed out of custody the moment I signed it,\" said Kohail.\nIn the letter, delivered by Canadian MP Deepak Obhrai last December, Kohail continues, \"Mr. Harper, I have been in jail for two years now. I am imprisoned with hundreds [of] high-profile criminals in Saudi Arabia for a crime that I did not commit. I've lost my hair, two years of my life and see death coming to me closer every day.\"\nKohail received 80 days to appeal the sentence. \"There were nine hearings in total and only one time was the lawyer for Mohamed and his friend allowed in the courtroom; not even Mohamed's father, Ali (was allowed in),\" said a relative.\nHarper is seeking clemency for the Kohail brothers. \"It has to be worked within the confines of the Saudi law and it's important to recognize that and work with the Saudi officials to come to a resolution,\" said Foreign Affairs Minister Lawrence Cannon. According to the letter, the Canadian government began seeking clemency March of 2008.\nIf the court continues to uphold the death penalty, the only other option is the payment of dia, or blood money, in exchange for forgiveness \u2014 but Al-Hiraki's family seeking CA$5 million.\nSultan Kohail is a juvenile who is out on bail awaiting to be tried in adult court on murder charges. The Convention on the Rights of the Child forbids execution of youths under the age of 18, which Saudi Arabia officials declare they comply with. However, the Convention also prohibits execution for crimes committed as juveniles no matter when the court sentences them.\nBorn in Palestine, the Kohail brothers moved to Canada in 2000, and became Canadian citizens in 2005. They moved to Jiddah in 2006.\nIn October 2007, Canadian Public Safety Minister Stockwell Day said, \"We will not actively pursue bringing back to Canada murderers who have been tried in a democratic country that supports the rule of law.\" Previously Canada consistently sought clemency from all foreign governments after the death penalty was abolished in Canada in 1976.\nSince the beginning of 2009, 36 people have been executed in Saudi Arabia. 102 were executed in 2008 and 158 were executed in 2007."}

An audit revealed that medical diagnostic tests involving results dating back a decade have been affected by the broken fax machine.\nOn May 6, a doctor called the health region officials seeking follow up on a patient's report. Staff who delved into it, found that the report was not sent from the system.\nNow, two weeks later, this same patient has still not been contacted by the health region.\n\"It has taken some time to work with the patient's physician.

Prosecutors claim that the Church is engaged in illicit practices in attempts to sell their alleged self-help material. The Church also faces charges of illegally operating as a pharmacy by illegally treating individuals with prescription medications.\nThe charges come from an unnamed woman, who in 1998 purchased nearly 21,000 euros (US$30,000) worth of Scientology self-help material which allegedly included prescription drugs. After a few months passed, the woman said she felt like she was being scammed because her condition was not improving. Lawyers for the woman say the Church tries to make a profit by pressuring individuals into believing they are going to be cured of their illnesses. \nShe claims she spent her entire life savings on the organization's products, including Scientology books, vitamins, and a device called an E-meter. Her attorneys say they will attempt to show that organized criminal fraud is inherent within Scientology practices. There were originally a total of five plaintiffs in the case, however three withdrew their complaints after coming to financial settlements with the Church of Scientology. \nFollowing several complaints from other unnamed individuals and an investigation, investigating magistrate Jean-Christophe Hullin in January, ordered the Church's \"Celebrity Center\" and bookstore in France and its seven managers to be put on trial for fraud and \"illegally practicing as pharmacists\". Hullin stated that the Scientology organization is driven by \"an absolute obsession with profit\", and is \"first and foremost a commercial organisation\". Sophie-Helene Chateau, presiding judge in the case, stated that the court's purpose is \"to find whether the acts in question constitute a crime. ... It is not up to the court to decide questions of society\". \nIf convicted, the managers of the Scientology organization in France under investigation could serve a ten year jail sentence in addition to a fine of one million euros. Those investigated include the Scientology Celebrity Centre in Paris itself, its manager Alain Rosenberg, and five other individuals. Rosenberg is the CEO of the Spiritual Association of the Church of Scientology-Celebrity Centre (ASES-CC), the official term for the Church of Scientology in France. One defendant died since the charges were initially filed against seven managers in the Scientology organization. The defendants are accused of \"exerting a psychological hold\" on vulnerable individuals so they would give money to Scientology.\nIn September of 2008, the Church released a statement saying that they felt \"stigmatized\" by the French judicial system.\n\"The special treatment reserved for the Church of Scientology Celebrity Center raises questions about the equality of the justice system and the presumption of innocence,\" the Church said in a statement to the press. The Church denies all the charges and says that no one was manipulated into buying their material. \n\"If the church\u2019s methods prove to be crooked then we must ask serious questions about whether it can be allowed to remain in business on French high streets,\" said plaintiff's attorney Olivier Maurice. If the Church is found guilty, Scientology could be fined approximately 5 million euros (US$7 million) and ordered banned in France. If banned in France, the Scientology organization then has the option to appeal, which could drag out the legal process. The trial will run until June 17.\nAccording to French law the Scientology organization is regarded as a sect in the country, and not a religion. In 2006, a report of the parliament in France characterized Scientology as a \"dangerous sect\". This is not the first time the Church has been accused of fraud in France. They have also been convicted of it several times, including the Church's founder, L. Ron Hubbard who was convicted of fraud in 1978. In 1997 the Church was convicted of fraud in Lyon and 1999 in Marseille. \"There are those who handed over tens of thousands of francs at the time. Now, it can be 300,000 euros per person, or more,\" said Roger Gonet, a French former Scientologist who was a plaintiff against the organization in 1996. The 1978 convictions included Hubbard and his wife at the time, Mary Sue, both now deceased, and two other Scientologists. Hubbard, along with the two Scientologists fled France, never to return, and never served a prison term."}

Cardiff TUC president Katrine Williams moderated as Derek Vaughan of the Labour Party, Jill Evans MEP of Plaid Cymru, and Rob Griffiths of the No2EU coalition, the tops of their respective lists, took questions from an audience of 22 composed largely of socialist activists and trade union members.\nCandidates from the Tories, Liberal Democrats, and Green Party were not invited to the evening debate, although the Liberal Democrats did take part in the TUC's debate earlier in the day. Ms Williams explained that the Liberal Democrats and Tories had been excluded because \"we wanted to have candidates more representative of trade unions\" but that not inviting the Greens had been \"an oversight\" due to the less prominent tradition of green politics in Wales. The BNP, UKIP and some minor parties also did not take part.\nIn opening statements, the three candidates discussed their records and their goals for the European Parliament. Mr Vaughan, leader of Neath Port Talbot County Borough Council, asserted the pro-organised labour credentials of the Labour Party, which has been under fire for several years from the left, and noted that Labour, which currently controls two of Wales's four seats in the EU Parliament, has brought \u00a31.5 billion to Wales, with a comparable amount to come in the future. Calling the BNP \"Nazis\" and comparing the British political situation to that in Germany in the 1930s, Vaughan called for the parties of the left to rally behind Labour in order to ensure that the BNP did not obtain any seats in Wales; but he expressed resignation to the likelihood that the BNP would earn a seat in North West England.\nMs Evans, meanwhile, who has been an MEP for ten years, announced her opposition to the pro-privatisation current in the EU and pledged that Plaid would support a new program of public investment and pro-organised labour revisions of EU directives, particularly the Posted Workers Directive.\nMr Griffiths, meanwhile, who is General Secretary of the Communist Party of Britain, took a position urging radical reform of the European Union. The Lisbon Treaty, which he characterised as a re-branding of the European Constitution, would, he argued, enshrine neo-liberal policies in Europe and impose them on its member states in a way that was irreversible \u2014 \"at least by any constitutional means\". Calling for a \"social Europe\" as opposed to a \"United States of Europe\", Griffiths suggested that the creation of a European Defence Agency and the actions of the European Court of Justice were being used to turn the European Union into a capitalist \"empire\" akin to the United States.\nDiscussion of the ongoing UK parliamentary expenses scandal and its implications for MEPs, who draw salaries and expenses considerably higher than Westminster MPs do, dominated the early discussion. The Labour candidate expressed the position that the problems in accountability leading to the scandal had been fixed; his opponents noted that of the parties currently representing Britain in Brussels, only Labour has not yet disclosed their expenses (although Mr Vaughan states that the party will begin to do so soon) and Mr Griffiths furthermore declared that the scandal was part of a wider problem: the corruption of the political system by big business.\nOn the subject of a common European defence policy the three candidates supported widely differing views. The No2EU candidate stated plainly that he considers Europe not to be threatened, and said that a European defence force would be used for foreign adventures in Afghanistan, Africa, and elsewhere in the developing world while at the same time building up the armaments industry in Europe. Ms Evans, meanwhile, argued that the proper role of a common EU force would be as a \"civil force\" supporting conflict prevention and conflict resolution operations, and also called for the abolition of NATO. Mr Vaughan finished the second round of questioning arguing that a common European armed force should be an alternative to the \"US-dominated\" NATO, but also stated the importance of bilateral alliances in building up a common European defence force, citing the Franco-German Brigade of the Eurocorps as an example.\nDebate ended on the contentious question of MEP salaries, with one member of the audience challenging the three candidates to pledge to accept a wage, if they won, equal to the average wage of their constituents. Ms Evans agreed that the set wage, currently \u00a363,000 rising to \u00a373,000 in 2010, was \"too high\", but would not commit to a so-called \"worker's wage\", under heavy criticism from the audience. Mr Vaughan, following, called it \"not fair\" to ask MEPs to take such a pledge but asserted \"I have never been motivated by money\" and finished his part in the debate with a call to elect more left-wing socialist MEPs. Mr Griffiths, whose No2EU coalition has made a worker's wage for MEPs part of their election manifesto, readily pledged to hold to a living wage, albeit not necessarily one equal to the average wage of his constituents, and described some of the difficulties associated with refusing an EU salary, noting that initially No2EU had proposed that its MEPs should draw no salary and claim no expenses from Europe but the coalition's legal advisors had said that to do so would endanger the status of any of its members as MEPs.\nVoting for the European Parliament elections in the United Kingdom takes place June 4."}

This year was the 15th year of the Convention, which started in 1994 at California State University in Hayward. It was estimated that over 16,000 people were in attendance over the 4 day course of events. While the event is called FanimeCon and was originally centered around the Anime subculture, it has become a more broad event in its run. Videos Games and Japanese culture tend to be two very popular cross overs with the world of anime. \nDuring the weekend there were numerous events in which attendees were able to participate. Some of the most popular proved to be the panels which varied in topic from \"Editing Manga\", \"Intro to Lolita and Fashion Show\", and \"How to talk to girls\". Along with the panels there talks and autograph sessions with the convention's guests of honor which included: Haruko Momoi, Hiroyuki Yamaga, Ken Lally, Reuben Langdon, Patricia Ja Lee, Carl Gustav Horn, Gilles Poitras, Jonathan Osborne, Keith Burgess, Ric Meyers, and Ryan Gavigan. For those that were more action oriented, this year's FanimeCon introduced \"The Dojo\" which featured hourly training sessions and weapons instructions.\nCosplaying is not an uncommon occurrence for this convention's attendees. Typically, the cosplaying is based on the attendee's favorite anime or video game character. The majority of con goer's seemed to be dressed up in one form or another. Some of these people had spent the previous year making their costume and most were gladly posing for pictures. Unlike Japan, cosplaying in America is a fairly rare occurrence, thus when the costumed attendees wandered away from the convention floor, they tended to get confused looks from anyone who happened to be passing by the venue. As with most large gatherings, the attendees flood most of the local establishments during the weekend, which the businesses take in stride and with great appreciation (perhaps even more so given the current financial difficulties) for their custom."}

Linamar claims to have no long-term plans to close the plant. On April 28, however, Linamar fired political activist and union convener Rob Williams.

Williams himself told left-wing newspaper \"Socialist Worker:\" \"They have sacked me because they want to weaken the union and intimidate the shop floor.\"\nWorkers at the plant also say Linamar is breaking a promise made to the union when the plant was taken over to keep Visteon's terms and conditions, particularly to establish a final pension scheme for workers who were part of the company before its 2000 spin-off from .\nLinamar has not given comment to the press on the dispute as of this writing.\nRallies in support of Williams, who is also running for European Parliament on the No2EU ticket, and of the union have drawn sizeable crowds, with about 90 at the most recent rally include three Members of the Welsh Assembly representing the ruling coalition of the Labour Party and Plaid Cymru as well as the Liberal Democrats, on May 17 outside the Visteon plant in Swansea.\nLinamar Swansea has close ties with Visteon factories in Enfield, Belfast and Basildon. Workers at those three factories recently won a victory against Visteon by occupying their plants and locking management out when redundancies were announced in April."}

The protest, organized by the United Campaign Against Police Violence (UCAPV) and with the support of several UK trade unions and activist groups, including from the 6th largest UK trade union; the Public and Commercial Services Union (PCS).\nProtesters marched against police violence in the UK, including as perpetrated by riot police against activist activities and by other police towards members of black and ethnic minority communities. The protest also called for an end to containment of protesters by police on demonstrations, a controversial tactic known as \"Kettling\" and for freedom to protest without intervention by police.\nThe march began in Trafalgar Square, central London, where police and private security attempted to move the rallying protesters, but did not succeed. Protesters marched on towards New Scotland Yard; the headquarters of the Metropolitan Police Service, passing Downing Street and Parliament in the Palace of Westminster, encountering minor police resistance and cheering Tamil Tigers protesters in Parliament Square as they marched past.\nSlogans chanted throughout the march included \"No Justice; No Peace\" and calls for the dissolving of the police Territorial Support Group (TSG), who have allegedly perpetrated acts of serious violence against protesters; a large proportion of the allegations of brutality during the G20 summit protests accuse the TSG. Among these calls were questions of 'How many skulls have you cracked today' and call-and-response of 'Hey Hey, Hey, Ho, Ho, The TSG Has Got to Go'.\nThe procession was accompanied by several police vans, officers on foot and Forward Intelligence Team (FIT) members. Policing of the event was mostly provided by CO11, the Metropolitan Police public order unit. \nThe protest crossed an SOCPA zone without police permission. Because of the illegality of the protest, it was not facilitated by police. Due to this, the police did not assist with traffic flow or close roads, including the road outside the main entrance to New Scotland Yard where the end rally was held.\nThe protest ended at the New Scotland Yard building, where activists gradually tried to surround the building by linking arms and hands, although did not succeed in fully encircling it. The attempted \"kettling\" of the building was followed by speeches from people affected by police violence, including member of the United Friends and Families Campaign, Doreen Bishop, mother of Ricky Bishop who died in police custody in 2001. Also speaking was Sam Rigg-David, representing the Sean Rigg Justice &amp; Change Campaign; Chris Nineham from the Stop The War Coalition; Martin Smith from the Socialist Workers Party and political rap performer/poet Lowkey and many other representatives from campaign groups and those representing affected families and groups.\nAs speeches ended, protesters held an open mic in the road next to the entrance to the scotland yard building. The road had not been closed and police had allowed traffic to attempt to continue along the road. However towards the end of the rally, protesters blocked 2 coaches from attempting to traverse the road by blocking the roadway, some sitting on the ground.\nThree protesters were arrested during the event. \"Wikinews\" learned from an anonymous legal observer from the Legal Defence and Monitoring Group on 28 May that one man arrested was believed to have an outstanding warrant following an animal rights activism related offense. A woman, believed to be his girlfriend, was reported to have been arrested for pushing and swearing at police after the male was arrested, and was arrested under section 5 of the Public Order Act 1986, for causing the police intentional harassment. The third, a man, was believed to have been arrested after allegedly urinating on the wall of the Scotland Yard building, in public view, and was arrested under either section 5 of the Public Order Act 1986, for causing the police intentional harassment or for indecent exposure under Section 66 of the Sexual Offences Act 2003; reports are unclear as to which.\nThe three arrested were taking part in the surrounding of Scotland Yard, and were arrested by police on the side of the building away from the main speeches and people; protesters were not aware of this until towards the end. The three are believed to have been taken to Charing Cross police station.\nAccording to the United Campaign against Police Violence; the protest organizers, they will be continuing to protest on this issue, the next protest being on July 10th 2009 outside the office of the Independent Police Complaints Commission.\nFurthermore, according to information released by the UCAPV; the University and College Union (UCU), representing lecturers, has officially affiliated to the campaign nationally."}

How did you choose that party? Did you explore others?\nIt was between the and the Left Alliance. The Greens I felt concentrated too much on individual life style choices as a method of doing politics, so I chose the Left Alliance. I have always been the sort of person who likes to think of structures and their effects, the big picture in a social sense if you may.\nSo what's it like campaigning for a nationally-elected office? Is it like organizing youth locally or does it feel basically different?\nBasically different. The whole country is one constituency, which means more traveling than most people do in a year. It's also expensive as in our election system candidates have to buy their way into public knowledge. Luckily I have both an extensive election team covering the whole country and also some financial support from the Left Youth movement.\nYou mentioned last night waiting for a bus and seeing three with pictures of you on the side pass by...\nIt's kind of absurd. I have ads in public transport in the 6 biggest cities in Finland. You are definetely more conscious of yourself when you're traveling on a bus or tram that has your face on it.\nNow, Finland's has fundamentally changed in your lifetime: from a neutral state with than many others in democratic Europe, to member and now potentially to member. Do you think your youth makes it easier for you to adapt to the changes going on?\nWell, it makes my relationship with Finland's EU membership definetely easier and less emotional maybe than for many older people. Finland has been in the EU my whole adulthood, so for me membership is not the question. I am more interested in looking at the content. I think the new political generation of around 30 year olds, who are making their breakthrough, are going to change political discourse substantially.\nDo you see green &amp; socialist politics as being the key to this younger generation? In your view can you have environmentalism without socialism?\nWe have an interesting Green party in Finland, who have accepted the necessity of additional nuclear power and support market mechanisms as a part of their climate policy without any questions or caveats. So yes, there is an attempt to create a . The youth as well are divided on this issue. Many people however do see the problems of turning the environment or climate action into products you can buy or sell and speculate with. In that sense I feel environmentalism cannot be separated from socialism, which has a fundamentally different logic.\nThe other end, though, to the importance of the youth vote is voter apathy; how do you deal with the situation of \"celebrity\" candidates, in particular far-right candidates like ?\nIn European elections the problem is apathy in general, not just youth apathy. But maybe you can separate between two types: many older people do not vote in these elections because they don't like the EU and/or because they feel they cannot change anything by voting since the EU is too big and too far way. These are choices, often resulting from considering the options. Many young people do not vote in elections in general, because they do not really even notice them. Their apathy is not a result of a decision, but genuinely a product of being out of the whle political process. This is something Timo Soini cannot change I think. His candidacy is a big risk for him in any case, since is a one man show to a great extent. If he buries himself in it might well be the end of that party.\nYou've been working in Brussels yourself for over a year now; how did you stay in touch with the situation in Finland before the campaign began?\nMostly by visiting Finland often. It's been two years that I have worked in the European parliament now. Working as a parliamentary assistant to a kind of means you need to be aware of what is happening in Finland and what the papers are saying about it.\nNow let's talk policy; on your website you mention numerous issues with the but also say that EU membership isn't an either-or consideration. If you could re-write Lisbon, what would you take out, what would you put in?\nSimply put I would take out all the militarisation stuff, and remove the economic thinking of no rules for the financial markets, and maybe remove some of the new policy areas. I would put in a social progress clause that would ensure rights (especially worker's rights) inside the EU and add a recognition for e.g. cross border strikes.\nOn the subject of militarization, what would be the best alternative to the ? What's the right path, if any, for collective European defense?\nDefense is a word that is understood very differently in different European countries. The Finnish tend to understand this term as passive defense, but many \u2014 especially old colonial countries \u2014 understand it in a more active sense, as including pre-emptive and aggressive operations outside EU borders. I believe the right path to be a firm concentration on non-aggressive . As for a common European defense, I am against the idea because of the abovementioned reasons. The European Defence Agency is basically an arms trading operation, when its role would maybe be better in co-ordination of crisis management and peacekeeping.\nSo in the long run should the other countries in Europe leave NATO as well?\nThat is for them to decide. However any European defence organisation would be based on NATO, and would not respect the status of non-allied countries. I believe the European Union should respect it.\nWith regard to workers' rights, a number of parties on the left have raised objections to the and the European Court of Justice's positions on the rights of workers from one EU country working in another. Finland both receives foreign workers and sends workers elsewhere; how could the Posted Workers Directive be best fixed, in your view?\nThere is no point in fixing the directive. The ECJ's decisions have been based on the Treaties, and override the directive, which itself is actually not too bad. This is why European trade organisations too have been demanding a social progress clause I mentioned earlier to be put in the Lisbon Treaty, which would be the only way to fix the situation. So that the rights of workers could not be overriden by for example the free movement of services, which has happened in most of the ECJ decisions.\nAnd what are the practical chances that such a clause would be put in?\nClose to zero at this point. However the Lisbon Treaty most probably will not be the last Treaty in the EU. And of course the Irish will still vote on it for a second time. Should the result be a no this time too, the chances would increase. What is not widely being talked of is that were are now in a situation where the EU is doing its best to get into effect a Treaty that was negotiated years ago and is founded on an economic logic that has clearly failed. This does not seem to bother most people.\nBut given that this process has taken so long, do you think the will for a new Treaty would be present \u2014 especially with the current Treaty having passed most national parliaments by solid majorities only a year ago?\nSolid majorities...The started its proceedings with it before a translation was available. Then they ratified without any public discussion. I think there would be will, but it is clearly not appropriate to talk about it, since the Lisbon Treaty is presented as the only option. Besides, tax payers pay the politicians to do their job. With that money one would assume they would not say they don't have the energy for a new Treaty.\nWhat place does the organized left have in a post-Lisbon Europe? Would they have to make an uncomfortable alliance with the anti-European right?\nI think such an alliance would be impossible in post-Lisbon EU too. The anti-European right tends to combine their act to anti-immigration as well in many cases, and very aggressively. I think with the current economic crisis there is an increased risk that the political right, even , could gain as people look for some way to express their frustration.\nSo to wrap up, then: what's the best thing the next European Parliament can do, and what's the best thing you could do in the next European Parliament?\nI think the best thing would be to recognise different opinions. The Parliament is very keen to restrict other voices and likes to pretend were are all one happy family. That is not politics at all.\nWhat I could do and want to do is to speak and try to fix problems with rights; they have not been properly dealt with in the EU, whether they are workers' rights or for example net users' rights. The fundamental problem with for example the telecoms package is that its staring point is not users' rights, defining them and then going into other stuff. Instead, the starting point is the interests of industry, and the limiting of users via different methods in order to protect certain copyright interpretations. The result then for the user is a collection of random and often illogical \"rights\". The net is something most politicians seem to be unable to handle as a normal and social part of life for millions and millions of people.\nSo where should net rights come from \u2014 from free speech rights, from privacy rights, from practical considerations of restricting the movement of information?\nFrom all of those. Mostly you tend to be in a situation, where you have to explain it to politicians that you cannot cut someone's connection (to for example bank services and other daily things) without a court order in copyright cases.\nHow do you feel about movements like Sweden's Pirate Party, which is a single-issue group pursuing radical copyright reform?\nVery neutral.\nAnything else you'd like to tell the readers?\nIt's been a pleasure. This is actually my second interview online, sort of. The first was earlier this week when I spent two hours on an anti-immigration forum answering questions. I must say you have been very friendly in your questions compared to that.\nWell, thanks for that. It's been a pleasure and thank you for taking the time out for this.\nThank you, and now I have to run to my next event!"}

On Saturday night, it was reported that attendance was up considerably over last year's event.\nMaker Faire, the self-declared \"World's Largest DIY Festival\", offers a forum where hundreds of makers and crafters alike man booths where they display their work. In the main halls alone, there were hundreds of booths. Outside the expo halls, the surrounding area was also filled with many interesting projects, some of which were mobile. In addition to all of the projects on display, there were a number of on-stage presentations. The biggest presentation of the weekend was given by Adam Savage who spoke on the topic of his \"Colossal Failures\". During his talk, the Fiesta Hall was filled to capacity. \nThe theme for this year's fair was \"Remake: America\" after President Obama's call to \"begin again the work of remaking America\". In addition, \"going green\", alternative fuel vehicles, crafting, steampunk and sciences for the young, were common themes found throughout the fair."}

According to a UN confidential report, people were killed (among them children) and were injured (among them children) between January 20 and May 13. A UN official declared to \"Le Monde\" that his hierarchy tried to suppress these figures to remain in good terms with the government. When these numbers were leaked, Neil Buhne, the UN official coordinator in Sri Lanka, asked to be the only recipient of the figures in the future. Even the secretary general Ban Ki-moon tried to hide the numbers, according to \"Le Monde\".\nDespite the heavy bombings in the last days of the war, the dead people are still given as an official figure which was repeated in \"The New York Times\". According to Vijay K. Nambiar, Ban Ki-moon's chief-of-staff cited by \"Le Monde\", the numbers could be closer to ; these figures are corroborated by \"The Times\". The paper discovered compelling evidence showing that on average 1,000 Sri Lankan civilians perished each day during the first 19 days of May. \"These figures are not even complete yet. It\u2019s going to end up way more\" said a UN source.\n\"The Times\" relied on aerial photographs, confidential UN documents, witnesses and independent defense experts to understand the final days in the 26 year old Sri Lankan civil war. survivors are interned in the Manik Farm refugee camp. The camp was visited twice by \"The Times\" investigators. wounded civilians are still missing from the last known makeshift hospital. A survivor reported hospitals were bombed by the government which claimed the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) rebels were using them as hideouts. \u201cThey didn\u2019t want anyone left to say what had happened,\u201d say UN sources. \n\u201cWe reject all these allegations. Civilians have not been killed by government shelling at all. If civilians have been killed, then that is because of the actions of the LTTE [rebels] who were shooting and killing people when they tried to escape.\u201d said a representative for the Sri Lankan High Commission. Brigadier Udaya Nanayakkara of Sri Lanka added \"We have not used any shelling or mortaring, only small arms. We know how we are fighting\". The aerial images taken by \"The Times\" suggest the contrary.\n\"Le Monde\" also wrote that the United Nations did not help its people on the ground. Text messages sent by local employees in the war zones asked to \"stop the war\" and \"what is the international community doing\". \"Hundreds of people trying to flew where caught by local dictators and beaten, without distinction of age and sex. I hear them crying.\" said another one. In April, Vijay Nambiar asked the locals to keep a \"low profile\" and play an active role in supporting the government.\nThe Sri Lankan government denied any wrongdoing. On Wednesday, the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva, Switzerland cleared Sri Lanka of any alleged war crimes. Sri Lanka gained the support of China, Egypt, India and Cuba."}

State Secretary Rigmor Aasrud said that the activities in question might be prosecuted as fraud or as violations of existing healthcare regulations. A Norwegian Member of Parliament (MP) whose daughter killed herself after taking such a test, supports the idea of prosecuting illegal practices rather than trying to ban the movement as a whole.\nThe statement was made after three journalists from the online edition of the newspaper \"Verdens Gang\" (VG) took the test. The journalists wore hidden recording devices, and did not disclose that they were journalists; VG put the recordings on its website. Scientology staff members told all three that they should buy a course to handle psychological issues. Two of the journalists filled out the 200 questions with honest answers, while the third gave answers consistent with being depressed. The \"depressed\" journalist was told that he should avoid traditional medicine, while one of the \"normal\" journalists was told that the course was her only hope for improvement unless she wanted to start taking \"chemicals\".\nMatthias Fosse, spokesperson for the Church of Scientology in Norway, said that the staff members in question were acting individually. He said that the Church of Scientology does not give medical advice, but that it encourages people to focus on the side effects of medications, and is critical of the \"over-medication\" of psychiatric patients.\nOlav Gunnar Ballo, a Norwegian MP and medical doctor whose daughter Kaja suddenly killed herself after a negative experience with the Scientology test in France in March 2008, released a book about Kaja Ballo's life in April 2009. The book debuted on 2nd place in the Norwegian best seller list. Ballo listened to the recorded test result sessions from VG and said that he found the practice \"horrible and harmful\". He told the newspaper \"Dagbladet\" that Norway could have something to learn from the current French prosecution of Scientology corporations and individuals, by prosecuting specific harmful practices rather than banning Scientology as a whole.\nMatthias Fosse said that France is a far more secular society than Norway, and that France were going too far in their prosecution. He said that France has a list of 165 organizations considered to be \"sects\", which not just included Scientology but also covered Baptists such as former U.S. president Bill Clinton. The list which Fosse referred to is a list from the 1995 Parliamentary Commission on Cults in France. Fosse said that the OSCE, the U.S. State Department and the UN had criticised French \"violations of human rights\"."}

During the last years, Chavez relied on high oil prices to push his social agenda. With the shortening of cash, Chavez cannot use oil revenues anymore to finance his budget.

A man is in custody over the killing.\n67-year-old Tiller had been the target of many previous attacks. In 1986 his clinic was seriously damaged in a bombing and in 1993 he was shot in both arms. In 1991 his clinic saw summer-long protests that resulted in 2,000 arrests and he said that in 1994 he was put under police protection after FBI agents uncovered an anti-abortion 'hit list' naming him as a top target. The clinic was vandalized earlier this month.\nThe controversy stemmed from the fact that his clinic is one of just three in the United States that performed late-term abortions, which are abortions of fetuses which are capable of surviving outside of the womb. This is legal in Kansas so long as two doctors agree the mother is in serious danger if she were to give birth.\nTiller was recently tried on charges of performing nineteen illegal abortions in 2003; he was cleared of any wrongdoing at the end of a trial described by his lawyer as a 'witch-hunt'. It was alleged that there were irregularities and a financial involvement in his relationship with the doctor who gave second opinions in the abortions.\nAnother controversy was sparked by donations Tiller made to support Kathleen Sebelius, then governor of Kansas. The donations, coupled with Sebelius' abortion-rights views, caused anti-abortion groups to oppose her nomination as U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services, but the Senate confirmed her in a 65 to 31 vote in April.\nTiller was killed at 10 a.m. local time in the Reformation Lutheran in Wichita.

Speaking to the public he said that \"The GM that let you down is history,\" and described a \"New GM\" that he expected to result from the bankruptcy process.\nHenderson stated that he envisioned the bankruptcy process would take between 60 and 90 days. He stressed several times his view that the process would be one that is executed quickly, saying that not just a sense of urgency but \"pure unadulterated speed\" was his expectation of the process.

He stated that GM would offer a \"deferred termination\" package to dealers, to allow them to cease dealing in GM vehicles in a managed and gradual way.\nHe stated that the bankruptcy filings did not cover General Motors' businesses in Latin America, Europe and the Middle East, and Asia and the Pacific.

In response to questions of whether the New GM would import cars from China to the U.S., he stated the formative company's core principle that \"We build where we sell\" applied in both directions, with GM building in China to sell in China and building in the U.S. to sell in the U.S., stating that this shortened supply chains.\nHe declined to predict when the New GM would return to profitability, stating that the goal was rather to lower the break-even EBIT point for the company. He also declined to speculate upon when the U.S. government would sell its stake in the company, saying that that was a question \"better addressed to the U.S. Treasury\", and merely saying that he expected it to be \"years, not months\" when the U.S. Treasury felt it would give \"the right return for taxpayers.\""}

In Staffordshire there was a wipeout of Labour, going from 32 council seats to just three. Another telling figure was the result from St Ives in Cambridgeshire: Labour's candidates placed last, behind the Official Monster Raving Loony Party's \"Lord Toby Jug\".\nWhile the results from the 2009 European Elections, which the United Kingdom also voted in on Thursday, will not be counted until Sunday, polling before the election indicated Labour's share of the vote could be only the fourth largest, after the Conservatives, Liberal Democrats and UKIP.\nLabour's troubles have prompted the Prime Minister to re-shuffle his cabinet, with Health Minister Alan Johnson becoming the new Home Secretary.

Other reports suggest the death toll could be as high as 5,000.\nAhead of today's anniversary, authorities placed known dissidents under house arrest and some were even forced to leave Beijing. Even family members of the victims of the massacre were placed under house arrest.\n\"We've been under 24-hour surveillance for a week and aren't able to leave home to mourn. It's totally inhuman,\" said Xu Jue to Associated Press. Xu's son was shot and killed by soldiers on June 4, 1989 at age 22. \nA protest leader, who has lived in Taiwan since 1989, was detained when he tried to enter China through Macau.\nUS Secretary of State Hillary Clinton urged China to \"examine openly the darker events of its past and provide a public accounting of those killed, detained or missing, both to learn and to heal.\"\n\"This painful chapter in history must be faced. Pretending it never happened is not an option,\" the President of Taiwan Ma Ying-jeou said in a statement.\nChinese authorities, nevertheless, made sure the day passed uneventfully in Tiananmen Square. Visitors were asked to present their passports and foreign journalists were barred from visiting the Square. Both uniformed and plain-clothed police officers stood guard.\nThe \"Los Angeles Times\" reported bus loads of men arriving at the Square with umbrellas. The paper called the scene a \"vast ocean of umbrellas\" and speculated that they were not ordinary tourists but sent there by the government to prevent people from taking photographs. A BBC report confirmed this, indicating that the umbrella-wielding crowd were all wearing radio earpieces as they smiled and persistently blocked all filming attempts around the square.\nThe government also blocked access to social networking websites and file-sharing sites. Foreign television news channels were blacked out whenever they carried a segment about the anniversary.\n\"Today is like any other day, stable,\" Qin Gang, spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said at a press briefing. He refused to acknowledge that there were special security measures in place.\n\"We urge the U.S. to put aside its political prejudice and correct its wrongdoing and refrain from disrupting or undermining bilateral relations,\" Qin said, and called Clinton's comments a \"gross interference in China's internal affairs.\"\nMeanwhile, in Hong Kong a large crowd attended a candlelight vigil in Victoria Park. Organizers estimated the crowd at 150,000 people, while police put the number at 62,800. Many carried banners in Chinese demanding justice for the students and other Beijing residents who died during the Tiananmen Square crackdown.\n\"I am very happy that people have not forgotten the massacre in Tiananmen on June 4,\" vigil attendee Yvonne Chow said. \"I am very sad because it destroyed our hopes for democracy.\"\n\"The New York Times\" spoke to former Chinese soldier Chen Guang who was part of the retaking of the Square. Guang is now an artist in the outskirts of Beijing.\n\"We were assured there would be no legal consequences if we opened fire. My only hope was that the students would not put up a fight,\" Guang said. \"I can assure you I didn\u2019t shoot anyone.\"\n\"For 20 years I tried to bury this episode, but the older you get the more these things float to the surface,\" he said of his art which is based on photographs he took in 1989. \"I think it\u2019s time for my experiences, my truth, to be shared with the rest of the world.\"\nDuring the protests, an incident occurred that gained international attention and quickly became an icon for the freedom movement in 1989. A lone man dubbed 'Tank Man', a yet to be identified Chinese man, gained world fame when he was photographed standing in the path of a convoy of military tanks on June 5, 1989, holding what appeared to be groceries, in an attempt to block their entrance into the square. Footage of the incident showed confusion, as the soldiers were unsure on how to proceed. After several attempts to go around the man, several men came out of the crowd and grabbed 'Tank Man' and carried him back into the crowd. To this day no one knows who he was or what happened to him.\nTwitter, a microblogging website, and other social networking sites this morning began spreading the word of the anniversary. As a result, China blocked access to the website along with nearly a dozen other major Western social networking and photo-sharing websites. Among them included Flickr, Livejournal and the Huffington Post. Law forbids that anyone talk about or discuss the events of 1989."}

Voting began on Thursday in the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and parts of Ireland. It continued on Friday across the rest of Ireland and parts of the Czech Republic. On Saturday the countries of Cyprus, France (for part of Outre-mer), Italy (day 1), Latvia, Malta, Slovakia and the Czech Republic all voted. On Sunday, the final day of polling, the remaing countries of Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Germany, Denmark, Spain, Estonia, Finland, France, Greece, Hungary, Italy (day 2), Lithuania, Luxembourg, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovenia and Sweden voted. Votes were released last night and will continue to be released over the course of today with the exception of Netherlands, which has broken rules and partialy released them on Friday.\nThe European Parliament is divided into constituencies, which have a group of representatives (the MEPs). Each constituency elects them proportionaly. The amount of MEPs representing a political party depends on the percentage of votes they gain. For example, if 50% of the electorate of a constituency vote for the x party then 50% of the MEPs in that constituency will be from the x party. In total there are 736 MEPs up for election by approximately 500,000,000 Europeans across 27 member states making it the largest transnational election in history.\nThe elections didn't quite go to plan across the Netherlands, as the European Commission have asked that Dutch officials give an explanation to results they released. As countries across Europe vote on different days, the results of the election can only be released on the last day (Sunday), so that the results in other countries will not influence the decission made by people in countries that are still voting. Despite this, the Netherlands released some of their results on Friday: 92% of the votes have currently been counted. Further controversy arose from the results themselves. Results so far show that far-right Dutch Member of Parliament, Geert Wilders's party the Party for Freedom (PVV), appears to have come second behind the Christian Democratic Appeal. Wilders is facing prosecution in the Netherlands for an anti Islamic statement and was refused entry to the United Kingdom on grounds of the intent to incite hatred. \nIt had initially been foreseen that the Treaty of Lisbon would have entered into force by the time of these elections, making them the first to be held under its provisions. However, primarily because of the failure of the referendum in Ireland, the framework established by the Treaty of Nice will be used again. Amongst other differences, the number of MEPs to be returned depends upon which rules are in effect: while 736 MEPs will be elected under the Nice rules, this number would have increased to 751 if the Lisbon Treaty were in force. A further change that Lisbon would have brought was an increase to the powers of Parliament, including powers over the appointment of the President of the European Commission.\nIn the previous election, German Hans-Gert P\u00f6ttering of the centre-right EPP-ED won with 34% and Martin Schulz of the Socialists came second with 26%. Despite this, during the last term the two leaders shared, each serving approximately two years in office. \nEuropeans have also been voting in local elections of County Councils in the United Kingdom and Ireland."}

The Airbus A330 with 228 on board vanished from radar on June 1st over the Atlantic Ocean.\nThe Brazilian Air Force had previously released a statement on June 2 saying debris from the lost jet had been found. A wooden cargo pallet and two buoys had been recovered, but are now believed to have been from a ship. The flight was carrying no wooden pallets. On June 2, it was reported, and previously confirmed by the Brazilian Air Force, that one seat and a life vest were found floating in the water. \nA fuel slick also thought to be from the plane, has also been confirmed to have come from another source, most likely a ship. The presence of fuel was used as evidence to suggest there had been no fire or explosion on board. Spanish paper \"El Mundo\" has quoted an Air Comet pilot flying over the Atlantic at the time as saying he witnessed \"an intense burst of white light\" falling out of the sky and breaking apart. A bomb threat, which later turned out to be \"false\", was also reported on a separate Air France flight from Buenos Aires, Argentina to Paris on May 27, just days before Fight 447 went missing. \nThe French Bureau of Enquiry and Analysis for Civil Aviation Safety (BEA) is leading the investigation, and has so far established that there were thunderstorms in the area and a series of automated signals from the plane indicated an inconsistent speed and a string of systems failures.\nAt 11:10 p.m. the autopilot disengaged and at least one computer switched to an alternative power source. There was an indication that flight control systems had sustained damage, and this was followed by the failure of speed, heading and altitude indicators as well as flight control systems, while control systems for the central computer system and wing spoilers also failed. Four minutes after the problems began the last message indicated total electrical failure and a loss of cabin pressure.\nFrench armed forces spokesman Christophe Prazuck commented that \"Everyone has doubts about everything at the moment and we do not have the slightest beginnings of an answer yet.\" French paper \"Le Monde\" commented that the aircraft's speed was too low, prompting the BEA to warn against \"hasty interpretation or speculation\" in regards to the cause. Airbus have reminded all A330 operators of correct operating procedures in extreme weather conditions.\nFrance has sent the research ship \"Pourquoi Pas?\" to the scene and the vessel is currently en route with mini-submarines to assist in searching for and recovering debris. The search is still underway for the plane's cockpit voice and flight data recorders, or black boxes. Brazilian officials previously said the boxes could be at the bottom of the ocean, between \"2,000 or 3,000 metres [6,500 to 9,800 feet] in that area of the ocean.\""}

They also said that the plane's auto-pilot was not active, although they say that from the error messages it is impossible to determine the reason for it being inactive. The crash is said to be the world's worst aviation disaster since 2001.\nOfficials have still not determined the reason for the flight's disappearance or located the wreckage of the plane, but have said that it was flying through an area of \"powerful cumulo-nimbus\" clouds. The authorities continued saying, \"these are found frequently in this area and in normal climactic [sic] conditions\". However other meteorologists said the jet was entering a zone with unusual storms and 100mph updrafts which could have formed a vacuum, sucking water up from the ocean.\nFourteen of the error messages sent by the system were done so within a period of one minute, 2:10 a.m. \u2013 2:11 a.m. UTC. It is thought that some of the error messages are related to the flight speed and controls related to auto thrust. Paul-Louis Arslanian, director of the French air accident investigation agency, said that the error messages indicated systems had shut down one after another. He also confirmed that the plane in question had encountered difficulties with measuring its speed and that Airbus was currently completing \"a programme of replacement, of improvement\".\nAirbus and Arslanian insist that planes are still safe, however Airbus have since re-sent information regarding difficulties with calculating speed and confirming their advice in such situations.\nPrevious announcements by the Brazilian air force that they had successfully located part of the wreckage of flight 447 have turned out to be false after ships recovered unrelated debris from the sea. After recovering debris from the sea, including a cargo pallet and two buoys, Brigadier Ramon Cardoso, the director of Brazilian air traffic control said, \"[U]p to now, no material from the plane has been recovered.\"\nHe continued, \"We confirm that the pallet found is not part of the debris of the plane. It's a pallet that was in the area, but considered more to be trash. The pallet was made of wood, and the Air France Airbus A330 did not have any wooden pallets on board. That's how we can confirm that the pallet isn't part of the remains of the aircraft\". It is thought the pallet came from a passing ship which is also being blamed as to the reason for the oil slick spotted in the area.\nDavid Learmount, operations and safety editor of Flight International magazine, said: \"The fact that the autopilot was not working is not the cause of this accident\", continuing by saying it is \"not at all unusual\" for the autopilot to cut out, alerting the pilots with a loud warning, adding \"it's not the cause, it's the symptom\" of the accident.\nHe also said that it was \"designed to cut out at any time that it receives conflicting messages, which we know it was\" and that \"It's designed to cut out rather than controlling the airplane in an unsafe way - it's not an intelligent system, it doesn't know which of the data are correct.\"\nRescuers have long since given up on attempting to find any survivors instead now trying to locate and recover the wreckage of the flight and more importantly the flight data recorders, without which they say they may never know what happened to the flight. The process of recovery is expected to be difficult with the seabed reaching depths of 3,000 to 4,000 meters. Both American and French specialist equipment has been sent to the area with the aim of recovering the recorders, however French officials say that the locator beacons attached to the boxes could possibly have become detached by the force of the impact.\nSpeculation has been rife as to the thought cause of the flights disappearance, ranging from a direct lightning strike to weather in the area, however recently a Spanish pilot has said, via his airline Air Comet, that on a flight in the area he saw an \"intense flash of white light\". The report, initially released by the Spanish newspaper El Mundo and then confirmed by AFP also said a co-pilot and passenger also saw the bright light.\n\"Suddenly, we saw in the distance a strong and intense flash of white light, which followed a descending and vertical trajectory and which broke up in six seconds\" the unidentified captain said."}

This became his sixth win in the season after seven races and became only the fifth driver to do so in history, after Alberto Ascari, Juan Manuel Fangio, Jim Clark and Michael Schumacher (twice). This is Buttons' forth race win in a row.\nPole-sitter Sebastian Vettel (Red Bull-Renault) made a crucial error on the first lap by running wide and lost the lead to Button. This spoiled the three pit-stop race strategy for Vettel who then lost second place to his teammate Mark Webber. Jarno Trulli finished fourth for Toyota.\nButton's teammate, Rubens Barrichello, had a poor start and damaged his car after several unsuccessful overtaking attempts and later retired with a gearbox problem after 47 laps. This was Brawn GP's first retirement in the 2009 season. Giancarlo Fisicella was the only other retirement in the race when his Force India car had brake issues after four laps. \nNico Rosberg finished fifth for WilliamsF1 with Felipe Massa (Ferrari) and Robert Kubica (BMW Sauber) finishing sixth and seventh respectively. Trulli's teammate Timo Glock closed out the top eight.\nJenson Button now has 61 points out of a possible 65 after seven races in the Drivers' Championship with Barrichello on 26 points and Vettel on 29.

Its mission is to bring the key donors of aid and relief together with the Israeli and Palestinian governments to address the current state of affairs between the two countries. The AHLC keeps track on how donor countries interact with the Palestinian authorities and how the support they provide is handled. \nEarly on the first day, Norwegian Foreign Minister Jonas Gahr St\u00f8re and Palestinian Prime minister Salam Fayyad both expressed optimism and hope for the Palestinian situation. Minister St\u00f8re underlined the importance of continuing aid, but stated that he understood that most countries still had problems because of the world economic crisis. As for the unstable political situation in Palestine, Prime Minister Fayyad explained that \"the political instability is also a reason why we need more aid.\"\nDuring the second day, a press conference with Minister St\u00f8re clarified the motives of the donations saying, \"It\u2019s is important to stress that donors are not doing this as a humanitarian project. Our donor aid is a political project aim[ed] at supporting and sustaining the Palestinian Authority, a key institution in what is supposed to become an independent Palestinian state. That was the intention of the Oslo accords.\"\nMinister St\u00f8re continued, stating, \"It\u2019s very important to stress that without a political horizon what we do as donors becomes less meaningful. So the current states of affairs where the political horizon is unclear and where we don\u2019t have political negotiations of the two states as previous commitments indicates and obligate the party\u2019s. Donors start to change their stand and other agendas get the upper hand. So in 2009 at this present stage, donors have only delivered half the amount they had at this time last year. You can leave that up to the financial crisis, but at the big donor conferences in Paris December 2007, and Sharm el-Sheikh February 2009 there were pledges enough to carry this through.\"\nOn the question if the donor countries had offered to give any immediate financial relief, Minister St\u00f8re said \u201cThis has to be stressed, [this] has not been a pledging conference. This has not been a donor conference where governments have been invited to come and make new pledges, as I said if everybody lived by their Paris pledges in December 2007, which were three year pledges, we are exactly half way in that, we would have been more or less fine. But I think we have seen a forthcoming approach by some delegations, I will not name them or put a figure on it but I think it follows from what the prime minister and I have together have expressed here that there is an urgent need.\u201d\nA new meeting has been scheduled for September in New York, New York in conjunction with the United Nations General Assembly.

This is the first time that the BNP has won a parliamentary seat in any European Parliamentary or U.K. General Election.\nAlthough the number of votes cast for the BNP in the North West England region in the 2009 election (132,094) was lower than the number of votes cast for the BNP (134,959) in the previous election in 2004, the percentage of the popular vote achieved by the BNP rose, from 6.4% to 8.0%, because of a lower overall voter turnout. Nick Robinson claimed this was because of the abolition in postal ballots in this years elections. He went on to say that BNP voters are more enthusiastic on voting, so their votes wouldn't decline as much as other parties.\nSimilarly, in the Yorkshire and the Humber region, the number of votes cast for the party fell from 126,538 in the 2004 elections to 120,139 in the 2009 elections, but a lower turnout resulted in the party's percentage share in the popular vote rising from 8.0% to 9.8%.\nThe BNP will now receive EU funding, in the form of MEP expenses and office and staff allowances. What it will receive will be governed by the \"Statute for Members of the European Parliament\", new rules for MEP expenses introduced for the newly elected 2009 parliament. Mr Griffin and Mr Brons will each receive a \u20ac7,000 per month salary (formally, 38.5% of the basic salary of a judge at the European Court of Justice), paid from the EU budget, and a pension when they leave office. They will also be entitled to employ personal staff, whose salaries are also paid from the EU budget.\nThe election of BNP MEPs has caused protests. Mr Griffin was accosted by political protestors when he attended the vote counting on the night of June the 7th, and was forced to enter the building via a rear entrance. When he stepped forward to make his victory speech, after the result had been declared, all other parties' candidates took the unusual step of leaving the stage."}

The stoppage is expected to last 48 hours and could leave millions of travelers without transportation.\nSky News says that there are fears that the strike may affect fan transportation for the England national football team's 2010 FIFA World Cup qualifier match against Andorra at Wembley Stadium tomorrow. Football Association (FA) chief executive Ian Watmore announced that the game would continue as planned at 20:15 BST (19:15 GMT) and encouraged spectators to arrive at the stadium early. The stadium gates will now open at 17:45 BST (16:45 GMT).\nNo extra transport is being put on and overground trains will not stop at Wembley, and car parking and park-and-ride facilities are unavailable at the ground. Fears of lack of transportation raised the possibility that the game would be forced to play behind closed doors without the team's supporters.\nWatmore said that refunds will be available for supporters that do not attend the game. Last week, the FA decided to halt ticket sales at 70,000 in anticipation of a possible strike. Wembley Stadium can accommodate 90,000 fans for football matches.\nIn years past, the RMT has been known to clash with the London Underground and its privatised contractors Metronet and Tubelines.\nOn June 5, London Underground offered staff a four-year pay deal or a two-year deal which they called an \"above inflation pay rise\". However, the RMT is seeking a 5% pay raise and a commitment to no compulsory redundancies.\nThe English national football team currently leads their group in the World Cup qualifying with 18 points and a 6\u20130\u20130 record. Andorra currently has no points and has lost all six of their matches. Although Andorra has been eliminated from competing in the 2010 World Cup, England is still competing for better placement."}

A sitting senator in the Virginia legislature, Deeds' campaign was hampered by restrictions on his ability to fundraise and the amount of time he spent on the Senate floor. A veteran of state politics who ran as a centrist in Virginia, whose northern counties are increasingly dominated by Democratic voters but whose western and southern areas still tend to support Republicans, Deeds benefited from several high-profile endorsements including that of the Washington Post. What may have clinched Deeds' victory, though, was a strategy of saturating online media sources with campaign advertisements, finished with a \"google blast\" of particularly intense advertising on Election Day itself.\nTerry McAuliffe, an early favorite to win the race, was formerly the chair of the Democratic National committee and later chair of Hillary Clinton's 2008 presidential bid, and entered the Virginia race just days after Election Day 2008. A New Yorker by birth with much experience in the Democratic party, McAuliffe's best skill was seen as his ability to raise funds in what analysts say will be an early test of whether Democrats, who won control of the White House and solidified control of both houses of Congress in 2008, can consolidate their gains in light of a contracting economy and an ongoing financial crisis.\nBrian Moran, a former public prosecutor and former member of the Virginia State House, entered the race shortly after Deeds. His brother, Jim Moran, currently represents the part of Virginia closest to Washington, DC in the United States House of Representatives.\nPolling before the vote showed Deeds pulling ahead from a statistical tie in May, but the likelihood of low turnout made the race hard to predict.\nVirginia Attorney General Bob McDonnell ran unopposed for the Republican gubernatorial nomination. McDonnell, who defeated Deeds by a fraction of a percent in the 2005 Virginia Attorney General race, currently holds a strong advantage over him in the fall general election, according to a recent poll conducted by the political blog \"DailyKos\".\nVoters will elect a new governor to replace outgoing governor and rising Democratic star Tim Kaine on November 3."}

Among the dead were two foreign United Nations officials working for the World Food Programme.\nAccording to the BBC, Fidayeen-e-Islam, a relatively obscure Pakistani militant group, claimed responsibility for the blast. The attack follows a threat from the Taliban made on May 27, warning of \"major attacks\" in Pakistan.\nThe bombing occurred despite the property being heavily guarded and secure. The militants gained entrance by overcoming the guards with gunfire, and forcing a bomb-laden truck, containing at least 500 kilograms of explosives, through the gates. Police official Liaqat Ali told the Associated Press that the militants \"drove the vehicle inside the hotel gates and blew it up on reaching close to the hotel building.\"\nThe bomb caused a 15-foot wide crater, and brought down the west wing of the hotel. An injured guest, Jawad Chaudhry, said, \"The floor under my feet shook. I thought the roof was falling on me. I ran out. I saw everybody running in panic. There was blood and pieces of glass everywhere.\"\nThe hotel is regularly used by businessmen and diplomats, and is located in a secure area of the city. Neighbours include the Peshawar High Court, Provincial Assembly and the official home of the Commander of the Frontier Corps. The perceived security of the neighbourhood makes it a candidate for the location of a planned United States consulate."}

A person, possible within the Prime minister\u2019s office has most likely received such a note and has reacted to the fact that the computer traffic had been under surveillance.\nVice admiral Jan Eirik Finseth told \"Verdens Gang\" that the Defense security agency's computer security section, reported that computer communication lines had been put under surveillance by military communications lines. Vice admiral Finseth stated to \"Verdens Gang\" that \"the circumstances is of such a nature that the police [were] asked to investigate if anything of this may be illegal.\"\nWhen \"Wikinews\" contacted State attorney Petter Mandt, who leads the investigation, we received confirmation that a search in J\u00f8rstadmoen took place, but he would not comment on what was confiscated, if anything.

Fueling was halted after the leak was detected near the Ground Umbilical Carrier Plate, or GUCP, which attached to the external tank at its intertank area,\" said NASA in a statement on their website.\nLaunch for mission STS-127 was scheduled for 7:17 a.m. (EDT) on Saturday from Kennedy Space Center in Florida. If NASA fixes the problem in a reasonable period, the next window of opportunity for launch would be at 6:51 a.m Sunday morning. If the problem cannot be solved by then, NASA says the earliest they would be able to re-schedule Endeavor's lift off would be June 17. This would conflict with the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO)/Lunar Crater Observation and Sensing Satellite (LCROSS) launch. Space Shuttle Discovery will be on standby in case of emergencies and STS-128 could be readied to launch by August 6.\nA similar problem in March forced NASA to push back the launch of Space Shuttle Discovery for mission STS-119. The problem was fixed and Discovery was able to take off.\nMission STS-127 is the 32nd flight dedicated to the International Space Station construction, and the final of a series of three flights dedicated to the assembly of the Japanese Kibo laboratory complex. The STS-127 payload is the Kibo Japanese Experiment Module Exposed Facility and Experiment Logistics Module Exposed Section. The mission is scheduled to last sixteen days.\nThis trip marks the first time that thirteen people will be on the ISS at the same time. Canada will see two astronauts in space simultaneously, also a first for the nation. Crew members listed to be part of the mission are Commander Mark Polansky, Pilot Doug Hurley, astronauts Wolf, Christopher Cassidy, Canadian Space Agency's mission specialist Julie Payette, and mission specialists Tom Marshburn and Tim Kopra.

Demonstrations took place late into the night, with waves of police fighting protestors in Tehran, Shiraz, Mashad and Rasht. \nProtesters chanting \"Death to the dictator!\" occupied major streets around Tehran, with roadblocks being set up against police. Tear gas has been deployed against protestors in the upscale Valiasr Street district of Tehran as well as at the University of Tehran.\nThe protestors are supporters of Mir-Hossein Mousavi, a candidate in the Iranian presidential election. Mousavi accuses the Iranian government of \"appalling\" fraud after it reported that the nation's current president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who had been expected to receive less than 50% of the vote and have to face Mousavi in a runoff election, received 62%. Addressing officials in an open letter, Mousavi said, \"this country has been through a grand Islamic revolution and the least message of this revolution is that our nation is alert and will oppose anyone who aims to seize the power against the law.\" The protesters, reports say, do not seek to overthrow the Islamic regime, which has been in place in Iran since 1979, but instead to reform it.\nIn a second letter, Mousavi reported that he has asked Iran's Guardian Council to nullify the electoral result and urged his supporters to wear green, take up the slogan \"Allahu akbar\" (\"God is great\") and peacefully protest the official position.\nIn response, Ahmadinejad celebrated victory in Tehran this afternoon with his supporters, and addressing a largely-sympathetic group of reporters at a press conference, asserted that the election had been free and fair and said\nIt has been reported that the safety of Ahmadinejad's rivals could not be guaranteed. As a result, many prominent reformists and leaders of the Islamic Iran Participation Front have been arrested. Rumors which spread around the nation saying Mousavi himself had been detained are, however, untrue and the candidate plans to address his supporters later today. However, the brother of former Iranian president and reformist Mohammad Khateimi has been detained. Former president Hashemi Rafsanjani has resigned from all his posts in the government in protest.\n125 members of faculty resigned in protest at Sharif University, students and faculty protesting together at the urban Tehran campus, and according to eyewitnesses, police, around 23:00 UTC, raided Teheran University, and arrested over 100 students.\nReporters Without Borders has said that the Iranian government has instituted mass censorship, with foreign journalists being asked to leave the country. It also says an interpreter working with an Italian news crew was beaten by police. Mobile phone services have apparently been cut, and many reformist and social networking websites have been blocked. The Iranian government has also made use of the Internet by circulating a false invitation to a rally outside Mousavi's headquarters; the city square containing the headquarters has been surrounded by police, trapping thousands of Mousavi's supporters inside.\nIranians living abroad as well as supporters of what is being called the \"green revolution\", from the colors of Mousavi's campaign, have staged demonstrations outside Iranian embassies and consulates in Rome, Kuala Lumpur, Paris, Berlin, London, and The Hague, with events planned in the United States in Chicago, Illinois and Los Angeles, California for later in the day.\nMeanwhile, the U.S. does not accept the results of the Iranian election. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said that she hopes \"genuine will and desire\" of the people will reflect the results of the election."}

Trooper Daniel Martin, a member of the Oklahoma Highway Patrol (OHP), was caught on video by his police vehicle's dashboard-camera in a physical struggle with paramedic Maurice White, Jr. after Martin pulled the ambulance over. Martin had previously passed the ambulance while en route to another call, but came back and pulled over the ambulance. The incident occurred on May 24, and footage from the police dash-cam was released following a tort claim filed by paramedic White.\nIt has also been suggested that the previous call had in-fact been to pick up his wife from a police station who was then present in the car during the incident between Martin and the ambulance. \nFootage by the OHP released Friday shows the ambulance personnel repeatedly informing Trooper Martin that they have a patient in the back of the ambulance that they are in the midst of transporting to the hospital. Martin yells at the ambulance driver for making what he claims was an obscene gesture \u2013 the ambulance driver asserts he raised both hands signalling confusion at the police officer's actions. Trooper Martin can be heard telling the ambulance driver \"I'm going to give you a ticket for failure to yield, and when I go by you saying 'What's going on?' you don't need to give me no hand gestures now, I ain't going to put up with that [expletive], do you understand me?\"\nThe video from the police dash-cam is eight minutes long, and paramedic White can be seen twice being pushed up against his ambulance by Trooper Martin. In one instance, Martin shoves White up against the ambulance while gripping his neck tightly with his other hand. In a written statement, paramedic White described the hold placed on him by the Trooper, stating \"he engaged my trachea in a claw-like grip digging his nail into my neck while partially shutting off my air supply.\" \nThe sister of the patient in the ambulance, Clara Harper, was following the ambulance and witnessed the incident. Harper later viewed the footage from the police dash-cam, and she stated to \"Tulsa World\" paramedic White \"never once became aggressive to that trooper.\" She asserted that \"He did nothing wrong.\" After the ambulance was allowed to continue transporting the patient to the hospital, Harper got into the ambulance to be with her sister. \"She was scared, and I was trying to calm her down and telling her everything was going to be all right,\" said Harper.\nParamedic White was interviewed by KOKI-TV, and recounted his thoughts as the incident was taking place. He stated his main concern was for his ambulance patient: \"It was surrealistic because I've never had such an experience. My biggest concern was for the patient. If there's any nightmare from this, it's because of what that mother, that patient, had to go through.\" White's attorney told KOKI-TV that if White deemed the arrest to be unlawful, he had the right to resist it. White is a paramedic for Creek Nation Emergency Medical Services in Oklahoma. He told \"FOX News\" he was surprised at the actions of the police trooper. \"He's taken an oath, just as I have, to protect and serve. I could not believe that this was happening,\" said White.\nThe Oklahoma Department of Public Safety decided to release the police dash-cam video publicly after amateur video of the incident was posted to the video-sharing website YouTube. Captain Chris West, spokesman for the OHP, explained why the video was not released earlier. \"We've been well aware of the fact that this incident has drawn enormous attention, but made the decision to protect the integrity of the investigation, any and all relevant evidence, as well as the rights of the department employees,\" said West. Prior to the release of the dash-cam video, a relative of the patient had posted video of the incident to YouTube. The son of the ambulance patient can be seen in a video stating to the camera \"Highway patrolman pulled over my mom's ambulance because he's mad we didn't pull over, and he tried to arrest ... the EMT from taking my mother to the hospital.\"\nRichard O'Carroll, the lawyer for paramedic White, said that Trooper Martin abused his authority as a police officer. \"Everything on this needs to relate back to why are we here? One man is there protecting a patient and one man is there abusing his authority and throwing his weight around,\" said O'Carroll. White's attorney filed a tort claim on behalf of his client in order to get the video of the police vehicle's dash-cam released. Trooper Martin's lawyer says he did not realize a patient was in the ambulance at the time of the incident.\nO'Carroll explained the decision of paramedic White not to use sirens while transporting his patient to the hospital: \"There was a reason he wasn't running sirens. There was a suggestion of chest pains and a heart condition and sirens aggravate these conditions by increasing the blood pressure.\" However the attorney for Trooper Martin, Gary James, said that the ambulance was not exempt from regulations because it did not have its sirens on. \"If they're not running their sirens or lights, they don't get afforded any emergency vehicle exemptions,\" said James. The OHP chief is handling an internal review into the incident. As of June 1, Trooper Martin has been on paid administrative leave. "}

Under this state of emergency the EPA is increasing clean-up assistance and medical care. According to federal prosecutors, asbestos has taken 200 lives and is the root cause of at least 1,000 illnesses in the surrounding area.\n\"This is a tragic public health situation that has not received the recognition it deserves by the federal government for far too long,\" according to EPA Administrator Lisa P. Jackson.\nIn the 1920's The Zonolite Company began producing vermiculite, a mineral that is often used in insulation. Between 1963 and 1990, W.R. Grace &amp; Company took over the mine operations. Tremolite asbestos was discovered in the vermiculite product. A study conducted by the Agency for Toxic Substance and Disease Registry discovered that the incidence of asbestosis in the population of the mine site area is far higher than the national average. \nAirborne asbestos exposure can lead to mesothelioma, a cancer which develops in the sac surrounding the lungs and chest cavity, the abdominal cavity, or the sac surrounding the heart. Prolonged exposure can lead to lung scarring, asbestosis, and lung cancer. Patients diagnosed with malignant mesothelioma generally are left with six months to a year before death.\nThe tremolite dust from the mine began leaking into the air from the plant in 1919. This resulted in a hazy asbestos dust cloud covering lawns, cars, clothing, and school athletic fields, creating an issue that citizens of Libby had to deal with on an everyday basis. The large amount of dust gave the impression of the aftereffects of a light sandstorm.\nW. R. Grace and Company did not deny that asbestos was found contaminating the vermiculite in the old mine. They said they proceeded in a responsible manner to clean up contamination following the mine closure. Grace will reimburse the EPA for US$250 million of the US$333 million that the EPA and the Department of Health and Human Services has set aside for medical expenses and asbestos clean-up. This money will be invested over the next five years, and does not include the millions in medical costs already footed by the company for residents of Libby and the nearby town of Troy.\n\"Today is the day that after years of work we were able to succeed in getting this [emergency declaration] done,\" Senator from Montana Max Baucus said, speaking at the EPA press conference. \"We will continue to push until Libby has a clean bill of health.\""}

U.S. President Barack Obama, who ordered Walpin's termination last week, has been accused of doing so for dubious reasons. The chief of these is that Walpin had been aggressively pursuing an investigation into Sacramento Mayor Kevin Johnson's purported misuse of federal grants meant for a nonprofit education fund.\nJohnson is one of Obama's good friends and supporters. Some journalists and pundits have speculated that this creates a conflict of interests and that Obama fired Walpin for damaging the reputation of one of his key allies. Making matters worse is that Walpin was reportedly given only one hour's notice prior to his termination. This is in direct violation of a law that Obama voted to enact while a U.S. Senator, in which an inspector general must be notified thirty days before being fired. \nDeclining to comment on the apparent illegality of the termination, Obama insisted that political favoritism played no part in the seventy-seven-year-old Walpin's firing. Whilst he gave no further reason himself, a letter written by White House staff members to Senate congressional leaders intended to allay their concerns over the firing stated that Walpin lost his job because he had acted \"confused\" and \"disoriented\" in a board meeting of the CNCS on May the 20th, 2009.\nThese statements were re-iterated by White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs, who also stated that they were supported by the other members of the board at the meeting. Both Alan Solomont and Stephen Goldsmith, chairman and vice-chairman of the CNCS board respectively, stated that they strongly endorsed Obama's decision to fire Walpin. In an attempt to answer questions regarding the validity of Walpin's termination, the White House proclaimed that it was completely legal, but did not elaborate on why. \nWalpin, however, does not agree with the Obama Administration's assessments of his mental health or job performance and accused Obama of blatantly lying to the public about both. Giving credibility to Walpin's defense is his attentive and alert behavior during numerous appearances on radio and television programs over the past seventy-two hours. During all of these appearances, he sharply refuted the Obama Administration's claims about his mentality. In an exclusive interview with Fox News Channel on Wednesday, Walpin not only accused Obama of lying about him but said that the claims themselves were \"absolutely wild\". He also said that he is now \"the target of the most powerful man in this country\" and that it seems like Obama's primary goals are \"to attack...and get rid of me\". \nOther reasons given by the White House for firing Walpin, which he equally denies, include statements made by Norman Eisen, Special Counsel to the President for Ethics and Government Reform, in a letter to two Senators. In the letter, Eisen says that Walpin had insisted upon working from home, in New York, over the objections of the board and had \"exhibited a lack of candor in providing material information to decision makers,\" engaging in \"troubling and inappropriate conduct.\" \nWalpin states that he worked from home with the agreement of the board, travelling to the office two or three times per week, adding that he had, in fact, intentions of resigning his position before Obama became president because of the difficulties the commute to work had caused between him and his wife.\nHe fully expects new attacks to be made against him by the Obama Administration in the coming days.

Due to nearby thunderstorms the launch was delayed about 20 minutes from the scheduled launch time of 5.12 p.m. EDT (2112 GMT). The mission will be NASA's first unmanned rocket expedition to the moon in a decade.\nThe aim of the LRO mission is to spend at least a year in a low polar orbit above the surface of the moon to gather neccesary data for future missions and longer lunar expeditions. It will be orbiting approximately s above the moon, trying to find safe landing sites, locating potential resources, characterizing the radiation environment and testing new technology.\nThe 2,300 pounds (1,043 kg) spent upper stage Centaur motor of the Atlas V launch vehicle will strike the surface of the moon at 9,000 km/h (5,600 mph) resulting in a 350 ton (317 metric ton) plume of debris rising between 6 to 30 miles (10 to 48 km) above the moon's surface. From this impact, scientists hope to be able to detect any water ice or vapor using the LCROSS satellite which will crash land nearby four minutes later. Astronomers who own amateur-class telescopes with apertures as small as 10 to 12 inches may be able to sight the ejecta cloud as it will have a period of brightness about one minute after impact.\nThe launch was originally planned for yesterday, but delayed for the launch of the Space Shuttle \"Endeavour\", which was itself later delayed again due to another hydrogen fuel leak."}

Total has made an end to the strike a precondition of a resumption of negotiations; meanwhile, the Lindsey workers' demands include a withdrawal of the 51 redundancies, an end to overtime, and sharing out of the remaining work at the construction project without layoffs.\nLindsey was the site of labor strife earlier in the year, with a week long strike in February brought about over employees' protests at foreign labor being brought to the refinery to undercut British workers' wages. IREM, an Italian construction company working at the site, has made heavy use of the Posted Workers Directive, which as interpreted by the European Court of Justice allows companies to make use of foreign labor from within the EU in one country while paying them only the minimum wage and offering only the coverages and benefits applicable in the employees' home countries.\nThe plant, which refines 221,000 barrels of oil each day, will remain at full capacity.\nAccording to its annual report, Total had a 2008 net income of \u20ac13.9 billion. Since the firings were announced, shares of Total have gone up in price 0.94% to \u20ac39.315 in morning trading."}

The study was started at the National Oncology Institute, before trials were conducted worldwide.\nThe new treatment, which serves as a guideline worldwide, involves using the drug gemcitabine as a radiosensibilizing agent to potentiate the effects of a regime of cisplatin chemotherapy and radiotherapy, explained Alfonso Due\u00f1as Gonz\u00e1lez, who led the study. Despite the addition of another drug making the scheme slightly more toxic, the secondary effects are acute and are present only during the 70 to 80 days the treatment lasts, during which the patient can become weak, as with any chemotherapy.\nUnder this treatment, the survival of patients rises to 78 percent. This is 9 percent above conventional methods, as concluded the study in its phase III, which lasted four years and involved 515 patients from different countries.\nDespite cervical cancer being preventable if detected early by the Pap test, it causes more than 250,000 deaths a year worldwide, becoming the second cause of death by carcinoma among women, and the second most diagnosed illness in this group.\nOne of the advantages of this therapy is that both gemcitabine and cisplatin are affordable drugs, which makes it available for the world population and may help reduce the death rate by this disease. According to Due\u00f1as Gonz\u00e1lez, although cervical cancer should be fought by focusing on early detection rather than on treatment, the therapy is expected to start being used in short by health institutions throughout the world."}

The investigation will be overseen by Janet Williams, a former special branch commander and run by the economic and specialist crime command unit.\nSince the \"The Daily Telegraph\" published details of MPs expenses, which ranged from a floating duck house to a pornographic movie for the husband of an MP, there has been public outrage at the claims. Many MPs have been forced to step down at the next general election.\nOn Friday, Parliament published the list of MPs expenses that \"The Telegraph\" had received, but with many claims blacked out and redacted. This in itself has provoked surprise and anger with the British public.\nThe Met was quoted as saying \"After consideration by the joint Metropolitan Police and Crown Prosecution Service assessment panel the Met has decided to launch an investigation into the alleged misuse of expenses by a small number of MPs and Peers.\"\nThe police did not name any of the people who were to be investigated, but the BBC reported that through its own sources it had discovered that they included Labour members of the lower house of Parliament, the House of Commons, David Chaytor and Elliot Morley, and Labour member of the upper house of Parliament, the House of Lords, Baroness Uddin.\nMr. Chaytor confirmed that the police had contacted his solicitor, and that he expected to be talking to the police within the next few days, to (in his words) \"explain my case, explain what happened\", and \"clear my name\".\nAny expenses claims made will be investigated to see whether they constitute offences. Such offences are likely, by their natures, to be offences under the 2006 Fraud Act, in particular \"Fraud by false representation\", as defined in \u00a7 2 of the Act. (This covers claims made over the past year, approximately. Any expenses claimed prior to that Act coming into force would have to constitute offences under the Theft Act 1978.) One consequence of this is that only those members of Parliament whose claims might have been dishonestly made will be subject to investigation. \nThe requirement, that the claim be dishonest for it to be fraud by false representation, means that any MPs' expense claims that correctly and honestly described what expenses were being claimed, or that were incorrect but not known by the MP to be incorrect when they were made, will not qualify as fraud according to law. An expense claim for (for example) a floating duck house is not fraud under the Act if it really \"was\" for a floating duck house, as claimed. Whereas an expense claim for (for example) payments for a mortgage that did not exist would qualify as fraud under the Act, subject to the additional requirement that the person making the expense claim \"knew\" that the mortgage that did not exist and thus was making a knowingly false representation about the thing being claimed for."}

Smith, who was one of New Hampshire's senators for two terms \u2014 which amounts to twelve years \u2014 said he is running for office in his recently adopted home state due to his disapproval of the direction in which America is headed. He is very optimistic about the conservative change he can potentially bring to Congress which is currently controlled by liberal-minded members of the Democratic Party.\nSmith has, however, some major hurdles to overcome in the Republican primary. He is facing two well known politicians who have been elected to statewide office numerous times. The chief of these is current Governor Charlie Crist, a moderate-to-liberal who is currently leading in the polls. The second is former Speaker of the Florida House Marco Rubio, a center-right 38-year-old who has been criticizing Crist for months on the support he has shown for President Barack Obama's controversial economic stimulus package.\nDespite trailing both in recent polls, Smith believes that the polls themselves are irrelevant as the primary is over one year away.

Each round eliminated from subsequent rounds any candidates with less than 5% support, with the winner to be the candidate who, in any round, achieved a simple majority of the vote. This was a new system for electing the Speaker, and the first time that the Speaker has been elected by secret ballot.\nIn the first round of voting, there were 10 candidates: Margaret Beckett, Sir George Young, Ann Widdecombe, Sir Alan Beith, John Bercow, Richard Shepherd, Sir Michael Lord, Sir Patrick Cormack, Sir Alan Haselhurst, and Parmjit Dhanda. All candidates made brief speeches in the chamber at 13:30 UTC (14:30 BST) immediately before the vote.\nFour candidates were eliminated by this round \u2014 Cormack, Dhanda, Lord, and Shepherd \u2014 leaving six candidates to go forward to the second round of voting.\nIn the second round, Widdecombe was eliminated, leaving five candidates to go forward to the third. All candidates apart from Bercow and Young lost ground. Young gained more votes than Bercow, but Bercow remained in the lead.\nIn the third round, all remaining candidates except two, Bercow and Young, withdrew from the contest, after an appeal to do so from the Father of the House, Alan Williams. This appeal was motivated by the length of each round of voting, which required 600 ballot papers to be printed, marked, and counted.\nIn both the first and second rounds of voting, one ballot was spoiled. Although the ballot was secret and the identity of the person whose ballot it was could thus not be confirmed, John Mann, MP for Bassetlaw, claimed it was him. \"None of them have got a strong reforming agenda,\" said Mann. \"Some of the speeches were shocking, after what we have been through recently.\"\nElection.\nAfter confirmation by a unanimous acclamation, with no \"noes\" voiced, John Bercow became the Speaker-elect for the 157th Speaker of the House of Commons. In accordance with tradition, he was physically dragged to the chair. At 19:31 UTC (20:31 BST) he delivered a 5 minute speech, paying tribute to the other candidates, before sitting in the chair itself. In that speech he paid tribute to his mother, pointing out that she had taken a keen interest in proceedings.\nHe also said: \"I want just to say this about the responsibility of the office. The Speaker has the responsibility to immediately and permanently cast aside all his or her previous political views. I said it \u2014\". Here he was interrupted by members anticipating the end of his sentence, and calls to \"come and join the Labour Party\". He resumed \"I said it \"and I meant it\". My promise to this house is to be completely impartial, \"that is what it's about\". I will do my best faithfully, honourably and respectfully to do my best in the months ahead.\"\nHis first three acts as Speaker-elect were to call upon the Prime Minister Gordon Brown, the Leader of the Opposition David Cameron, and the leader of the Liberal Democrats Nick Clegg to speak. Brown and Cameron both commented upon Bercow's hobby of playing tennis, with Brown observing that Bercow had now permanently taken the position of umpire. The Prime Minister said that on the matter of Bercow's casting aside of his past political views, \"some of us thought you had done that some time ago\". Cameron also pointed out that Bercow was the first Jewish Speaker to be elected by the House in its history.\nCameron and Clegg both reminded Bercow of the comments made by Parmjit Dhanda, who had said in his candidacy speech earlier that afternoon: \"All of the 10 (candidates) is capable of doing the job but \u2026 do we all really get it? Do we understand the level of crisis out there. Do we understand the level of public\u2019s anger.\"\nRoyal Approbation.\nBercow's election as Speaker elect remained subject to Royal Approbation. This was not given in person by the Queen.\nAt 20:51 UTC (21:51 BST), the Lords Commissioners assembled on the Woolsack in the House of Lords, and summoned the House of Commons via Black Rod, who in turn summoned the Commons at 20:54 UTC (21:54 BST). The clerk of the House of Lords read the Royal Commission, authorizing the Lords Commissioners to speak in the name of the Queen. At 21:01 UTC (22:01 BST) the Lord Chancellor Jack Straw, spoke for the Lords Commissioners and declared Bercow to be the Speaker of the House of Commons.\nBercow's first act as Speaker, after returning to the Commons and formally notifying it of events in the Lords, at 21:06 UTC (22:06 BST) was to call upon the Leader of the House, Harriet Harman. She proposed a motion, carried by acclamation without dissent, for the Commons to call upon the Queen to elevate the previous Speaker, Michael Martin, to the House of Lords. Bercow's second act was again to call upon Harman, who proposed a motion to adjourn, again carried by acclamation without dissent."}

Both houses met as the Congress of France in the Ch\u00e2teau de Versailles. It was permitted by a revision to the Constitution of France that was enacted in 2008. (Previously, rules based upon the doctrine of the separation of powers had prevented Presidents from addressing the Congress directly except in order to propose revisions to the Constitution.)\nIn the speech, which was boycotted by the Green and Communist parties, Sarkozy said that \"We cannot accept, in our country, women imprisoned behind a mesh, cut off from society, deprived of all identity. That is not the French Republic's idea of women's dignity.\" He stated that the burqa \"is not a sign of religion, it is a sign of subservience.\"\nSarkozy's remarks come in the wake of his government proposing last week a Parliamentary commission to draft legislation barring the wearing of burqas by Muslim women outside of the home, and of calls by French parliamentarians, including GDR member Andr\u00e9 Gerin, and government ministers, such as Fadela Amara, for an inquiry into Muslim dress codes.\nSarkozy himself stated that he was calling for a public debate. \"A debate has to take place and all views must be expressed.\", he said. \"What better place than Parliament for this?\"\nDalil Boubakeur, rector of the Great Mosque of Paris, stated that some Muslims themselves also believed the burqa to be a symbol of submission, and stated that Sarkozy's remarks were \"in keeping with the republican spirit of secularism\". He views the reported increase in the use of the burqa by Muslim women in France as a move towards radicalization of Islam in the country, and calls instead for an \"open and convivial Islam that allows people to live side by side\".\nSarkozy's remarks continue an on-going controversy about Islamic dress in France. Feelings run strong in France over what is called \"la\u00efcit\u00e9\" a concept, enshrined in the Constitution, that embodies components of secularism, separation of churches from the state, division of the private and public spheres, preventing the government endorsement of any single religion, and (according to its critics) anti-clericalism, religious intolerance, and the endorsement by default of erstwhile official religions at the expense of the religions of immigrant communities.\nSarkozy called for the public debate to focus on these issues, and not to become a debate over Islam itself. \"We must not fight the wrong battle,\" he said. \"In the Republic, the Muslim faith must be respected as much as other religions.\"\nFrance is home to Western Europe's largest Islamic community, with some five million Muslims living there."}

It is felt that negligence contributed to the massive fire Friday afternoon, June 5, taking the lives of 47 toddlers and infants and injuring the majority of the 142 children being cared for by six staff who were also hospitalized.\nThe ABC Daycare Centre installed a brightly coloured tarpaulin as a ceiling below the high roof. In 2005 the owners were advised to remove the tarp, and equip emergency exits and the main exit with larger and wider regulation sized doors. The daycare owners did not make the recommended changes, and continued to receive contracts to operate and also passed subsequent safety inspections including one a couple of weeks before the fire.\nOfficials have determined that the fire began in the neighboring warehouse which was used by the northern Sonora state Finance Department and contained license plates, tires, and paperwork. Nobody was working Friday and this warehouse was locked with the air conditioner left running. The air conditioner overheated, short circuited and melted its aluminum housing which began flames in the paperwork below. This neighboring warehouse had no fire alarms, fire extinguishers nor water sprinklers installed. \n\"The fire was caused by the overheating of an air conditioner due to continuous and prolonged use,\" said Eduardo Medina Mora, the Attorney-General.\nThe fire and smoke rose above the wall connecting the daycare and Finance Department warehouse, and was trapped in the daycare between the tarp and the warehouse ceiling. The daycare fire alarms were installed below the tarp, and did not alert the staff to the fire trapped above the tarp until the tarp itself caught fire which instantly dispersed smoke and flames onto sleeping infants below. One of the emergency fire exits was padlocked shut and could not be used the day of the fire by rescue teams.\nSeven finance department officials have been arrested on negligence and charges of negligence are to be laid also against seven others. \"They are employees and officials with the Finance Department who have a direct responsibility for the warehouse where the fire started,\" said Abel Murrieta, the state Attorney General.\nThe fire chief of Hermosillo has been removed from his position.\nThe wives of two high ranking state officials operated the privately run daycare under contract from the Social Security Institute. These two state officials have resigned. The owners will be charged with negligence by the state's Finance Department. The Social Security Institute will also begin a civil lawsuit against the owners. The head of the Social Security Institute has stepped down and others have been suspended.\nSources.\n "}

Four former Scientology executives stated that they witnessed the Church of Scientology's leader David Miscavige physically strike staff members numerous times. \nThe former executives speaking out include Mike Rinder, who served as head of the organization's legal and public relations division the Office of Special Affairs, Mark Rathbun, former Inspector General of the organization's Religious Technology Center, Tom De Vocht, former manager of the organization's operations in Clearwater, Florida, and Amy Scobee, a former Scientology staff member in California who assisted in construction of Scientology's Celebrity Centres. Rathbun supervised the Church of Scientology's response to the Lisa McPherson case, after she died under Scientology care in 1995.\nRinder said the impact was more one of humiliation than physical pain: \"The issue wasn't the physical pain of it (being assaulted by Miscavige). The issue was the humiliation and the domination. ... It's the fact that the domination you're getting \u2014 hit in the face, kicked \u2014 and you can't do anything about it.\" Rathbun asserted Miscavige would assault executives during conferences. \"Regularly David Miscavige would in the middle of a conference physically assault, punch, slap or grab by the neck a number of executives,\" said Rathbun. \nDe Vocht said that Miscavige would \"lose it\" if he did not hear a satisfactory answer from his executives: \"If it wasn't the answer he wanted to hear, he'd lose it. If it was contrary to how he thought, he'd lose it. If he found it to be smart aleck, or it was a better answer than he had, he would lose it.\" Scobee was critical of Miscavige's actions while calling himself a \"religious leader\". \"You cannot call yourself a religious leader as you beat people, as you confine people, as you rip apart families. If I was trying to destroy Scientology, I would leave David Miscavige right where he is because he's doing a fantastic job of it,\" she said.\nIn its preparation for the investigation, \"The St. Petersburg Times\" staff met with attorneys and representatives for the Church of Scientology for 25 hours. According to the paper Miscavige was sought out by reporters for an interview from May 13, but they were informed he would not be available prior to July. Miscavige e-mailed the paper on Saturday, complaining that he was not interviewed. \"I am at a loss to comprehend how the St. Petersburg Times can publish a story about me and the religion I lead without accepting the offer to speak with me,\" wrote Miscavige.\nChurch of Scientology representatives denied the statements made by their former executives, and claimed the individuals left the organization after being demoted. They claimed the former executives were motivated by feelings of revenge and only speaking to the press for financial gain. \nScientology spokesman Tommy Davis acknowledged violence occurred within the ranks of Scientology management, but claimed that it was Rathbun and not Miscavige who carried out the assaults. In comments to the Associated Press, Davis referred to the statements made by former executives about Miscavige as \"absolutely, unquestionably false\". Scientology representative Lyman Spurlock stated \"What they want to do is extort money from the church. ... and right now the St. Pete Times is their extortion vehicle... you're just their lackeys. They're using you.\"\nThe \"St. Petersburg Times\" reported Monday on the attention received by the investigative articles in other media. The Associated Press carried the story, and it was included in over 177 television and news websites including MSNBC, the \"Los Angeles Times\", \"The Guardian\", and the \"Chicago Sun-Times\", as well as blogs and media sites for \"The Huffington Post\", \"Gawker\", \"L.A. Weekly\", and \"The Village Voice\". By Monday the first article in the series had received over 3,600 \"diggs\" at the social news website Digg and generated over 420 comments at the site. A post at the \"On Deadline\" blog of \"USA Today\" called the investigation \"a fascinating three-part series\". \"Juicy stuff from a mainstream newspaper coming out and hitting Scientology hard,\" said biologist and University of Minnesota, Morris associate professor PZ Myers in a post to his blog Pharyngula. \"I'm sure there are meetings going on in Clearwater right now where they're plotting revenge,\" wrote Myers."}

Temporary server outages were reported for Twitter, TMZ.com (the site that originally broke the story), and the web site of the \"Los Angeles Times\".\nOn \"Wikinews\", the report of Jackson's death received 1,150 page hits in its first hour of publication, almost 9 times as much as the number of page hits received by Wikinews' second most popular story that hour. At its peak, the \"Wikinews\" story received 4,466 page hits in one hour. On Wikipedia, an edit war ensued when users repeatedly deleted references while reports of his death remained unverified.

These stories were rapidly revealed to be hoaxes, but some news outlets carried the stories by mistake. The entertainment report on Nine Network's \"Today\" show, for example, mistakenly carried the story of Goldblum's death. Goldblum was in fact alive and well in Los Angeles, California, according to an official statement issued by his publicist.\nThe hoaxes originated on a web site that generates superficially genuine but false news reports from pre-set formulae, into which the celebrity name of one's choice can be entered. One of the options available is for the report to state that the celebrity \"dies in New Zealand\" at Kauri Cliffs near Matauri Bay. Because of this, many people attempted to contact New Zealand police, forcing Inspector Kerry Watson of the NZ police to issue the following statement:\nThis is not the first time that this particular hoax has circulated.

Yesterday morning the top seller in the album chart for Amazon's U.K. division was \"Off the Wall\", followed by \"Bad\" and \"Thriller\" in second and third places, respectively. \nMany stores, including Graywhale CD Exchange in Salt Lake City, several record stores in Danville, Virginia, and many retailers in New Zealand, have all reported selling out of Jackson's CDs and DVDs. The flagship store of Tower Records Japan, in Shinjuku, sold out of several of Jackson's DVDs and ran low on several other items including CDs. The \"Danville Register Bee\" recommended to its readers that if they had record players they should investigate antique and charity shops, after one antique shop reported discovering three Jackson Five vinyl albums in its basement.\nThe effect of the increase in sales had an effect on stock prices. Midday yesterday, Apple shares rose around 2%, Amazon shares rose around 1.3%, and eBay shares rose by 0.64%. Stock market analysts predict that this will be a short-term effect, however. Scott Fullman, an investment strategist at WJB Capital Group in New York, stated \"This is going to be one of these events that will have an immediate impact and then wane out in a week or two.\".\nMemorabilia sales.\nIn Las Vegas, 21 items of Jackson memorabilia, including handwritten lyrics for Jackson's song \"Bad\" and the shirt that Jackson wore on his Victory Tour in 1984, sold at auction yesterday at the Planet Hollywood Resort and Casino for a total of USD$205,000, with the shirt, at USD$52,500 the most expensive individual item.\neBay has reported an increase in individuals auctioning Jackson memorabilia. These range from records to a Fedora hat signed by Jackson. \nAlso for sale on eBay and elsewhere are tickets to the This Is It concerts, at the O2 arena, where Jackson had been scheduled to perform. Ticket sellers such as Ticketmaster, Seatwave, and AEG Live have announced that they will be refunding concert tickets. But under standard contract law such refunds only apply to the original purchasor of the ticket, who dealt with the ticket companies directly. Anyone buying a ticket on eBay only has recourse against the seller on eBay that they bought from, and even then only if it was explicitly stated in the terms and conditions of the particular eBay sale that a refund was available.\nAt the 2009 Glastonbury Festival, stalls have been selling commemorative T-shirts to Festival attendees, with various different slogans including \"Michael Jackson R.I.P 1958\u20132009\" and \"I was at Glasto 09 when Jacko died\". T-shirt vendors also appeared outside of the UCLA Medical Center where paramedics took Jackson, proferring for USD$10 T-shirts with the slogan \"in loving memory of Michael Jackson\" and a silhouette of Jackson, although they had few takers.\nIn Union Square in New York, one street artist was selling hand-made buttons that have pictures of Jackson's album covers on them. In Times Square, another T-shirt vendor was selling T-shirts printed with copies of the front page of \"USA Today\" that reported Jackson's death.\nOne observer, Allison Southwick (a Better Business Bureau spokeswoman), commented \"I'm honestly expecting to see a Web site pop up by the end of the day selling Michael Jackson commemorative plates.\" Whilst such commemorative plates have yet to appear, collectors have been offering commemorative stamps of Jackson for sale on eBay and elsewhere. Several commemorative stamps of Jackson already exist. Saint Vincent and the Grenadines issued $5, $2, $1, and 60\u00a2 Michael Jackson stamps in 1985, as part of its \"Leaders Of The World\" series. Tanzania issued a 350s stamp, part of a \"Famous Black Entertainers\" set, in 1990. Guinea issued a 500f stamp in 1991. St Vincent issued another $2 Jackson stamp in 1991, as part of \"Famous Entertainers\" series. And Grenada issued a 60\u00a2 Jackson stamp, part of its \"Gold Record Winners\" series in 1992.\nComparison to history.\nGore Vidal once remarked of the death of rival Truman Capote that it was a \"good career move\". The death of an artist does serve to increase the popularity of their works. People have speculated whether this will be a temporary or a permanent thing for Jackson.\nJim Lentz, who is the Chief Operating Officer of American Royal Arts (a memorabilia dealership in Boca Raton), asked \"Is he Elvis or Marilyn Monroe, or is he Mike Tyson?\".\nElvis Presley died at 42, officially of heart failure. Stores sold out of his records and souveniers within hours of the news of his death. In the 20 years following his death, RCA Records sold approximately 400 million of his recordings.\nIn the days and weeks immediately following Presley's death, RCA had to sub-contract pressing to other companies, as it was unable by itself to keep up with demand. Sony Corporation announced yesterday that it had received \"unprecedented\" levels of orders for CDs of Jackson's music, and was considering boosting production. It had received 150,000 orders for CDs at its music unit in Tokyo. \"The amount is unprecedented for one day and we think we need to consider increasing the production of CDs that we plan to sell from July.\" said a spokesman for the company. Amazon has been informing customers buying Jackson CDs that they might have to wait between 1 and 3 weeks for their orders to be shipped."}

The accidents included the Adam Air Flight 574 disaster, where an airliner vanished from radar and crashed, Adam Air Flight 172, a nonfatal accident in which a plane cracked in half after landing and Garuda Indonesia Flight 200, a runway overrun that killed 21.\nThe ICAO had issued 600 safety recommendations to Indonesia. According to foreign minister Hassan Wirajuda, there are 69 requirements issued to the airlines by the EU, of which 62 have been met. Indonesia has also made improvements to its safety infrastructure, introducing better inspections. Earlier this year, five airlines had their operating certificates revoked for failing inspections.\nThe EU said the decision was made as a result of \"significant improvements and accomplishments of the Indonesian civil aviation authority\" which \"are recognised in the area of safety.\" Garuda plans to launch services to Europe next year.\nThe EU list now also contains all Zambian airlines and every airline from Kazakhstan except Air Astana. Astana has had restrictions put upon its flights to Europe.\nEuropean Commissioner for Transport Antonio Tajani used these additions as an opportunity to repeat a call for the list to be made global, which he had first suggested after the crash of Yeminia Flight 626 earlier this month.\n\"We cannot afford any compromise in air safety,\" he said. \"Citizens have the right to fly safely anywhere in the world. It is high time that the international community rethinks safety policy. Those airlines which are unsafe should not be allowed to fly anywhere.\"\nThe only other modification to the list was to Angolan flag carrier TAAG. Previously banned completely, they will now be allowed to fly some of their aircraft into Portugal, with operating restrictions. The move comes after the Portuguese and Angolan civil aviation bodies signed a deal to co-operate to improve safety."}

Officials estimate that number could grow as other counties report in. \nAccording to Tim Reimer of the United States Farm Service Agency, cattle nearing slaughter are difficult to keep cool due to their large size, and thus more vulnerable to heat. The animals are provided large quantities of water, but they sometimes stop drinking under the effects of the high temperatures. \nThe deaths worsened the situation for farmers, who were already struggling with high feed costs. \"There were some that took some pretty substantial hits financially\", Reimer said. \nTemperatures in eastern portions of the state soared into the mid 90s. The heat wave was preceded by an unusually cool spring, so the animals didn't have a chance to acclimatise. Terry Mader, a professor at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, reported that \"Cattle, as well as other animals and humans, usually need two to four weeks to adapt to the changes in environmental conditions we observed last week. Sunny days with temperatures above the mid-80s can be stressful, particularly if there is no wind and humidity is above 50%.\" \nSimilar heat waves occurred during the 1990s, when thousands of cattle were lost. Mader noted, \"There's no opportunity for them to get prepared [...] Normally, you'll have one to two days in a heat wave to get prepared.\"\nMature cattle are generally worth US$1,000 apiece. "}

The UN Security Council was criticised by the AU for its refusal to consider suspending al-Beshir's warrant for one year, which Africa said could have helped efforts seeking peace in Darfur."}

The quartet, known as the Phoenix Four, paid a symbolic \u00a310 (approximately \u20ac15) for Rover in 2000.
