While the Colts will be searching for his replacement, Twitter reacted to the news of his retirement.\\nI’ll never forget lining up for a play and Phil pointing to one of our linebackers and telling him he was lined up wrong based off the blitz we were about to run and being 100% correct about it haha. One of the smartest I’ve ever played against and a hell of a competitor. https://t.co/1AZxyvDafu — JJ Watt (@JJWatt) January 20, 2021\\nPhilip Rivers career:\\n* 5th most passing yards ever: 63,440\\n* 5th most passing TD ever: 421\\n* 8X Pro Bowler Perhaps most impressively: 252 straight starts. Never missed a game. Rivers played through a *TORN ACL* in the 2007 AFC Championship. — Field Yates (@FieldYates) January 20, 2021\\n2004 ▶️ 2020 A phenomenal career for Philip Rivers. pic.twitter.com/aDzY02NwP2 — Sunday Night Football on NBC (@SNFonNBC) January 20, 2021\\nA small thing to most but huge to me: Philip Rivers gave this story to one person: Kevin Acee, longtime columnist from the San Diego Union-Tribune. He\\'d covered Rivers for years and they were close. Rivers is loyal, man.
