Not once have I seen a couple that did not have an enormous gap in interests composure speech patterns and emotional engagement. Theres always and awkward disparity between each partner and they seem to be tolerating each other whilst there is little to grasp on why they are interested in each other aside from basic biology. As a result of this homosexual relationships have always seemed purely the logical and socially optimal choice for anyone pursuing a relationship and heterosexual relationships continue only because of a heteronormitive society and the biology of reproduction which I believe is immoral but thats another topic. I may be biased but from my perspective and experience Ive simply never seen a straight couple that was legitimately compatible in most ways.\n",

      "17 j I think that for redistributing wealth to deal with increased automation expanding the welfare system makes way more sense than UBI. I want to begin this by defining UBI and the welfare system as I understand them. UBI to provide all legal residents of a country a standard sum of cash unconnected to work The Welfare System Providing income to societys lowest earning citizens on a sliding scale so that the lower your income the more assistence you get. Expanding this would mean that we redefine where we draw the line on who should deserve assistence. If we want to redistribute wealth to deal with automation we could decide that the income limit for who recieves welfare could be much higher than it is today but it still could be distributed on a sliding scale based on income. The reasons I believe an expanded welfare system is better will be broken into parts.\n",

      "19 j To clarify what I mean by the Title I believe that people with a predominantly subsaharan African heritage are genetically inclined to lower intelligence when compared to Whites and East Asians.This does not mean that all black people are less intelligent than white people. Some black people are much more intelligent than some white people but these are outliers and are accounted for by probability distribution. Why do I think this way? First off studies have consistently shown that Blacks preform lower on IQ tests in the United States than Whites and Asians. This is not denied by any researchers on the subject even the APA acknowledges this to be the case but does not offer a explanation of why.\n",
      "20 j As I see it the problem we have with police brutality in the US is strongly underpinned by the fact that police in general have demonstrated that they cant be trusted to adequately manage their use of typicallylethal methods of force. Thats not even unexpected as far as humans go managing highstress situations like that where youre running on adrenaline is a whole different ballgame than practicing at a shooting range.In addition to that there are plenty of other methods that are designed to incapacitate rather than kill and in highadrenaline situations where splitsecond decisions are king that seems like it can mean the difference between alive and dead.As such I cant see a reason to continue giving the police access to the standard sidearms etc. that they have now especially not the militarygrade weaponry.\n",
      "21 j Just a note I do not believe in Nazism. Now I know this view is controversial and I know its generally frowned upon but my lifelong belief is that eugenics isnt that bad. This started before I can even remember. I felt that people who live off of welfare and do nothing all day but drugs and get fat should lose their reproductive rights. At no time I believed people should die.\n",
      "22 j There is a tasteless trend going on that dismisses complex social issues in most of the world as an allencompassing and canned idea of general failure. We are allowing ourselves to paint a grossly inaccurate picture of life on our planet an illusion where countries neatly fit in a linear scale that goes from Sierra Leone to Denmark. Couple that with priming from media that thrives on negativity and you get social networks saturated with overblown and sometimes nonexistent complaints.Ultimately the point of hosting an international event in the developing world is being completed missed. A country that has always lagged behind the richest nations and is in deep economic recession currently is managing to host a mostly smooth event. Sadly the Rio games seem doomed to be forever tainted by what amounts to unrealistic unadjusted firstworld standards and possibly contaminating the impeccable World Cup the sheer novelty of it happening outside Western EuropeNAJapanAustralia overlooked.\n",

My University sets aside the week of Veterans Day as the week we have Veterans week. However this year that week has to share the week with Transsexual awareness week.Now why does this upset me? My campus is rather liberal as are most college campuses so there are weeks like Black Culture Week LGBT Week Transsexual week etc. Which is fine Im all for gay rights trans right and recognizing the cultures of other ethnicities.\n",

What I dont understand is the suggestion to silence those that spread hateful ideas such as racialreligious bigotry.

      "29 j If they do they should let both students and educators know that for example on a scale of to with being totally incoherent and being their accents dont affect learning at all for the average English speaker this particular educator rated a .I say especially colleges and private schools because unlike high schools and middle schools were actually paying for our educations. No one should have to worry that their money is invested into a professor that can barely be understood.This view sources from personal experiences in which both my science and math professors were from India and China respectively. The science professor spoke in a thick Indian accent and we were put behind schedule because of the time someone had to stop her to repeat what she had said. The math professor was a little worse she didnt know how to say certain mathematical terms and her words were so distorted I wondered if she was even speaking English anymore. In fact if I were to utilize my idea from the previous paragraph the Indian one would be rated a and the Chinese one a .Of course I am speaking of only the United States and yes I understand that we are a nation of immigrants.\n",

My view on money is I see it like water we know theres always water so we always drink it without rationing it hence I use my money without rationing my use because I know Ill get paid again hence getting more water. Im always tempted to spend it on food clothes etc because I know Ill get paid again but I want to break the habit of spending. I want to just view money differently because I just see it as renewable source I tried the process where you act like youre spending your hours instead of money but it didnt work for my spending habit because Ill still work any suggestions will be considered thanks!\n",
      "42 j I recently got married and one thing my wife and I have discussed at great lengths is what we should do with our surnames.I have come to the conclusion that we currently do not have a reliable fair gender equal convention for dealing with family names in marriage.Example case Groom Jones and Bride JohnsonTheir options are Patrilineal Mr amp Mrs Jones. Matrilineal Mr amp Mrs Johnson. ConjugateDoubleBarrel Mr amp Mrs JonesJohnson or vice versa No action Mr Jones amp Mrs JohnsonMatrilineal or Patrilineal naming conventions are inherently unbalanced as they require one partner to lose their name for the others.Double Barrels offer a potential solution to this imbalance but I do not think that this is an adequate compromise. If everyone used this form of naming we would end up with overcomplicated and longwinded surnames within a few generations.If our example couple have children and they marry someone who also has a doublebarrelled name you may end up with something likeMr amp Mrs JonesJohnsonHamptonGoldsmithThe only alternative we have thought of is creating a cadet branch with a new surname however this will still leave our theoretical children in the same position once they are married and if this were the norm surnames would essentially be discarded with each generation.Although I am using a heterosexual couple in my example this issue becomes even better demonstrated when both partners are of the same sex. In this case the traditional weight of Patrilineal marriage does not make sense as either both partners are male or neither are.\n",

      "45 j Many years ago watches served the purpose of being able to tell time. Now with cell phones as well as a plethora of other personal devices that are able to tell time watches are functionally useless. In my opinion the only reason watches still exist are for fashion appeal which I find stupid. Yeah boots cost but they serve a niche purpose that hasnt been filled by another item. I just think its asinine to spend dollars on an item with no functional purpose for the sake of being fashionable.\n",

      "47 j Although some parts of his memo wasnt the most scientifically backed up it does have some merit as men and women are scientifically proven to be slightly different mainly due to hormones. His argument was phrased in a thoughtful and polite way without namecalling or other forms of rudeness. All the response from the new VP of Diversity shows that is that theyre unwilling to show tolerance to anyone who doesnt have the same political beliefs as them and that that as a company they want to shove ideology down their employees throats. If a conservative company did something similar they would certainly not be praised. Furthermore firing an employee for expressing a concern that workplace discrimination is occurring is illegal to the best of my knowledge not exactly sure about different jurisdictions.\n",
      "48 j Ive just read this comment and the ensuing thread Ive seen the sentiment quite a bit lately that rich people acting in their selfinterests directly screws over poor people and that this is wrong.Economic theory dictates that this is not immoral. If nobody could afford the ridiculously high rent prices nobody would have rents that high. Nobody would build luxury housing if nobody could afford it. Poor people have just as much a right to live in a city as rich people but the reciprocate is true as well. It just so happens that the rich can afford to jump in line to get into the city.\n",

Im a strong liberal but I believe the concept of transgender individuals is tied strongly to the concept of gender roles. Why bother changing your gender or identifying as a different one if they are equal? Dysphoria is a real issue but thats purely psychological. If someone truly believed man woman then why would they feel the need to be one or the other. Men can wear make up nail polish dresses suits high heels and be nurturing.\n",

      "54 j The reason so many people have against allowing homosexuals to marry is that they feel marriage is about having and raising kids.It would seem to me that people who feel this way should also be against allowing older people from marrying such as ones whose kids are already grown or who had no kids in the first place.They should also be against allowing infertile people to marry. I will l not accept the argument here that the persons infertility can be cured lets assume it cannot or they are infertile because they had surgery done and dont want kids. I point out as well that just because a person is homosexual doesnt mean they cannot conceive a child through other means. Being homosexual doesnt mean a person doesnt want kids at some point.\n",
      "55 j This popped up on TIL conversation and was always an opinion Ive held.Say that you have a webcam and someone periodically without your knowledge watches you through it. You are completely unaware of the fact and you will never find out for the rest of your life. If you are unaware of your lack of privacy why is it a big deal?Assuming that someone isnt out to harm you or steal from you in any way I feel like being monitored isnt that serious. After all one is probably subjected to it a lot in their lifetime for all we know at this very moment but its inevitable and as long as I dont know about it why should it matter to me? It would not impact my life in any way shape or form.I am totally open to changing my view since I see the other side of the argument but have never been thoroughly convinced.\n",
      "56 j Public schools exist to provide education to poor families that cant afford alternatives. Its a program meant for the lessfortunate which makes perfect sense considering education for children must be provided under penalty of incarceration. Parents that have any problems with whats being taught have every right to educate their children themselves or send them to a private school public education isnt being forced on anyone. School prayer advocates should be sending their children to christian schools and if they cant afford it always have the option to homeschool. The fact that they arent indicates that theyre either trying to unlawfully indoctrinate other peoples children against their parents will or havent figured out that beggars cant be choosey.\n",
      "57 j Stereotypes are often wrong but can contain a kernel of truth. IME inexperienced people are more likely to be clingy or weird about sex. Promiscuous people do tend to make less stable partners. Perhaps not true across cultures and populations but good rules of thumb in many places.It is completely okay to reject someone for their sexual history or habits. Not just for what someones history might indicate about them but also due to aesthetic preferences.\n",
      "58 j So not to get hung up on technicalities but people cite the equal protection clause of the constitution as a basis for the claim of discrimination inherent in samesex marriage bans. Personally I dont think the government should be involved in marriage at all. But semantically if that is the right word to use marriage defined as a legal union between a man and a woman for the purpose of shared property andor procreation is available to people with alternate sexual preferences just they dont want to partake in it. It being still available means they arent being discriminated against by choosing not to marry a person of the opposite gender. Oh woah! Wait a minute! You might say.\n",
      "59 j So to go ahead and clear something before you guys start thinking Im transphobic Im not. I support females having sex changes and males having sex changes if they choose to do so.There are only two genders and sexes. Can there be feminine males and masculine females? Yes absolutelyMales can like the color pink and like other feminine products but they are still a man because of their genitalia. Females can like trucks and like hunting and other masculine things but they are still a female.Now can a female become a male?\n",
      "60 j The reason I say If were going to incorporate maternity leave is so that we can set aside the valid discussion of should we incorporate parental leave at all. That is a valid discussion but its not the subject of my view and not something Im prepped to debate this is predicated on accepting that maternity leave should be implemented. Even if you disagree with that just set that aside so that we can focus on the issue I am willing to view described in next paragraph.If we are going to incorporate maternity leave then it should be exactly equal to paternity leave for however long it is. I can think of two reasons. This will reduce sexism against women by employers.\n",

      "63 j So Ive had this long standing confusion when it comes to wallets. I know a number of people who keep their wallets in their back pocket. Ive never understood this and think its illogical.

We wouldnt want to damage the phone by sitting on it too hard squish the gum drive a key into our butt and the same concept applies to a wallet.\n",

      "65 j As I understand it the argument for guns as a check on government overreach presumes that American gun owners will be able to rise up against a tyrannical government and be able to overthrow the it. This may be valid at present the military is composed of human beings who may or may not be sympathetic to a revolutionary cause. However were the military composed of autonomous robots the sheer firepower differential between the government and any popular revolt will lead to a very short lived revolution.It follows that if government overreach is a serious concern of the NRA they should do something about autonomous military robots.\n",

What it does is causes a bunch of people with no desire for college to go to college for the wrong reasons.\n",
      "67 j One of the biggest gripes I have with animal rights is that they treat animals in anthropomorphic ways. They just assume that an animal feels one way or the other about something.First of all different species have different requirements. What applies to one species doesnt work for another. Animal rights activists often use human values and ideals and impose them on animals even if they are inapplicable. Captive animals are one such issuehumans dont like being in captivity and some other species of animals probably also dont like captivity but you cant say all animals dont like captivity.\n",
      "68 j So lets say you applied for a job. People who hire will often look at your facebook and other social media to get a feel for who you are.The problem with this is prejudgement.People who judge others do so through their own filters and often misjudge people. Meaning that if you applied somewhere and someone searches your social media they are not doing anything but judging you on who you are outside work scenarios and not your ability to perform the job.If for example you are a partier and post pictures from your parting this has nothing to do with your ability to perform your job well or ability to show up on time.Thats just one example but you get the idea.I agree in some cases doing a quick internet search on someone can give you great insight as to who they are but this kind of discrimination when hiring is just as bad in my mind as prejudging someone because of skin color gender or sex. It is just wrong. Especially when you consider that working at a corporation means putting on a fake persona anyway and bending over backwards for the customers and company.Workplaces rarely allow you to be your authentic self.\n",
      "69 j First of all Ill point out that there are government services such as police forces and public libraries which Im glad to pay for. There are also many many uses of taxes of which I disapprove examples war electricity for accent lighting at government buildings negligible but wasteful in principle and the death penalty. Im forced to pay at least partially for all of these things and offered no way to choose where my money goes.Apparently I consented to these conditions by being born. If I refuse to pay taxes Im fined. If I refuse to pay the fine Im eventually sent to prison.\n",
      "70 j Okay so a lot of male authors rightfully so get a lot of flack for writing terrible female characters. However the thing is I think JK Rowling is just as bad at writing male characters as some men are at writing women.Disclaimer I cant really blame JK for this. A lot of people have trouble connecting to the opposite gender. However I believe that JK Rowling IS bad at writing male characters and no one really acknowledges it. Also I truly do adore harry potter but that doesnt mean that i think that theyre perfectSo lets look at the prominent male characters of Harry Potter and think about themHarry Harry is basically a Mary Sue.\n",

As far as I am concerned there is no such thing as separate but equal and separating genders reinforces gender stereotypes and inequality just as racially segregated schooling does.Much of the prestige associated with singlesex schools comes from the fact that many are highly selective private schools. The fact that they are successful owes more to their status as private and screened schools than it does to the fact that they admit only one gender.At its core segregation is wrong.In my school we have twice a week where we have about a half hour with girls only with female teachers and boys only with male teachers with occasional switching of the teachers so sometimes a male teacher has the girls group.

      "78 j For the majority of this post I am referring to my experience watching the Daredevil show on Netflix outside of video games I dont have much more knowledge of the Daredevil universe. Also by conventionally blind I am referring to the fact that Matt Murdoch Daredevils alter ego pretends that he needs a stick to walk around with and that he needs help crossing the road etc when he can actually sense his surroundings incredibly well.Id like my view changed because I quite enjoyed the show but this mechanic of it is annoying me. First and foremost I just dont think its that unreasonable to explain to people that you have learnt to deal with your blindness by sensing your surroundings better. This would at least allow him to not walk with a cane and pretend he cant find every chair in every room. I would assume this is a rather annoying way to live your life and for no additional benefit that I can see.\n",

If you havent seen the graphs take a look Chinese GDP growth over timeChinese vs US manufacturingChina has experienced a rare thing in economics sustained growth over a long period of time. While this growth slows some signs of showing some slowing seems fairly normal as the countrys economy matures.

      "84 j A few months ago usdneidich suggested that I watch Star Trek with my daughter when shes old enough to understand its themes citing the positive message that it lays out for the future of humanity.I hadnt watched Star Trek in years so when my daughter was born I started to do some primary research on the subject I watched episodes from each series except for Deep Space Nine mostly because that series sucked major donkey testicles and I didnt want to have to go through it again.I had mixed feelings regarding whether Star Trek and while Ive enjoyed watching the shows as a mindless timekiller I think that the show isnt worth sharing with future generations.Star Treks proscience positioning counts as a plus in my books because it encourages the viewer to think about the potential that the future could hold. In a time when so many are rejecting basic science its good to see a TV franchise that can romanticize the actual pursuit of science. My only reservation here is that it doesnt portray a balanced view that would promote sustainability in current behavior practices making the future look far rosier than it will actually be.That said some of my reservations are on the cultural side of things. Culturally the Star Trek mantra containing ...to seek out new life and new civilizations is problematic because it suggests a fairly humancentric and ethnocentric view of the universe. The underlying implication is that a civilization is new until humanity meets it.\n",
      "85 j By and large I think people like conspiracy theories because they explain things in an easier to swallow version than the truth. They permeate all parts of the political and belief spectrum but theyre no less comforting. Its so much easier to say Newtown was a false flag than to come to terms with the fact that there are people in the world who can and do shoot kindergarten children because...they just do. is easier to accept as a conspiracy than as an aggressive attack aimed exclusively at civilians. Autism is caused by a faulty gene it can just happen theres nothing you can do to stop it from grabbing your child.

      "87 j First of im far away from being an expert on this topic i guess i understand the basic ideas but im not familiar with depths of this topic. So the problem with gender roles is that we put humans in categories based on their biological sex and connect those categories with certain behaviours and claims but humans are more complex than that and not every male will behave like society expects how a male acts and vice versa. To solve this problems people claim that there should be more than genders but isnt that creating the same problems and make things way more complicated than they should be? Wouldnt it be easier and better just to treat every human as a complete individuel in that aspect instead of having thousand other categories? The whole thing looks completely paradox to me so please change my view\n",

A vegan or vegetarian diet denies demand and thus potential revenue to all meatproducing farms regardless of how humane or environmentally sound their practice are.a Since the majority of farms are large factory farms I concede that this is probably good for animal welfare. However Purchasing meat from farms known to produce their meat in an ethical way not only denies demand to large factory farms but helps improve the market share of ethical meatgrowing which seems as though it would be even better for animal welfare.My general view is that people should probably as a rule eat less meat from better growers and that will make for a bigger shift in growing practices than simply people dropping out of eating meat altogether. Moreover this practice would be much easier to evangelize than a vegetarian or vegan diet.\n",

      "92 j The idea of serving the homeless is such an obviously good thing to do that its become the goto accusation when say people want to call out hypocritical Christians e.g. You say you love Jesus but you avoid homeless people when you see them on the street etc.I have been struggling with this because one part of my brain recognizes that people are not as fortunate as I am dont have the resources or the physicalemotionalsocial support to sustain themselves and whatnot and the other part is deeply mistrustful of what these people have done to end up where they are. Of course theres the punchline Oh hed just spend it on drugs anyway and I know its wrong to make assumptions but sometimes when you see a homeless person who looks obviously cracked out selling terrible s CD compilations on the city streets and asking for a tip for reminding you to turn off the light in your car you cant help but think Youve done this to yourself. If you have any friends or family they probably wont even let you in their houses anymore because you steal their stuff and manipulate them into feeling sorry for you. Or the guys who walk with an exaggerated limp next to a freeway offramp at the time when everyones getting off work.\n",

      "100 j A few weeks ago a woman who was formerly a Baltimore Ravens cheerleader was arrested for rape after allegedly having sexual relations with a yearold boy. This story is not all that unique as there are plenty of instances when older women often teachers have been arrested for having sex with males under the age of consent. And while I dont necessarily think that women in these cases should not be punished at all I think punishing them as much as older men who prey on young girls is also not appropriate.I dont think its a controversial statement to say that males are naturally more sexually aggressive and promiscuous than females. That is seen across cultures and even across species. Simply put men want sex more than women they just do.\n",

You have to spend X dollars on a buscartrain to get to work.\n",

      "103 j Conservatism in its most basic form is just wanting things to stay the way things are. This means that instead of thinking about and analysing a new idea or solution to a problem conservatives prefer to stick with the current way of doing something. This to me seems like they are not very willing to even consider new ideas even if they may be better than the current system tradition which is essentially just narrowmindedness. Traditions are held as sacred and are therefore not compared fairly and rationally to new alternatives. Conversely I dont think its true that progressives want change for changes sake but at least embrace change when they see a problem with the current system.\n",
      "104 j Although many people seem to think that the only value that art possesses is subjectively granted by whoever is experiencing it I tend more towards all art having objective value. Yes different people will not enjoyappreciate a work of art the same but this enjoyment is a quality that has nothing to do with the art itself. If you suddenly removed all people capable of experiencing art it would still have value. This is because the value of art comes from its creation rather than how people interact with it afterwards.There is a certain essence that art possesses that comes from its creation an essence that is composed of what can be most accurately described as the creative genius and skill that goes into making it. Although peoples measurements of this essence will differ it could be measured from an objective point of view one which is devoid of the subjective limitations of humans.\n",

Our children are going to die too one dayWhats the use in spending your time working when in the end what your working for your cause will come to an end?I believe that the pursuit of worldly joys such has falling in love working hard maintaining friendships and taking care of yourself is really not worth the hassle as eventually all these things love friends and your job will come to an end and become meaningless.\n",
      "106 j First things first I dont dislike Daenerys. I think that throughout the course of the series she has grown as a leader and is coming into her own as a potential ruler for Westeros. Does that make her deserving of it per se? Thats a matter of opinion and its not one that I necessarily prescribe to.However I do think that regardless of whether or not anyone else is deserving of the throne be it Jon Asha or Arianne there will be no one else who takes it because of the giant fucking deus ex weve watched grow through the span of the series.Im talking of course about the dragons. At the end of the day if Dany has dragons does it really matter how many men Jon has loyal to House Stark?\n",

My main argument for this is that the same argument vegans have for not being able to eat eggs chicken fetus completely contradicts the prochoice argument for abortions of the fetus not actually being life. How can they believe that it is morally wrong to eat eggs as they will become life but are ok with abortions not caring that that fetus will no longer have a chance at life.The only counter I can think of is that they are against eating eggs because of the way they are mass farmed not because they are potential life. This may be where I am wrong but I think this is a scapegoat to this issue. I dont think this is the only place they are coming from when they are against eggs etc.\n",

Clinton was filmed to say why arent I points ahead? and then Trump and her greeted each other rather cordially for someone who wants the other literally shot.

So is that fact that men who call the police to report domestic violence against them are more likely to be arrested than the ACTUAL PERPETRATOR. Thats disgusting and obviously I could list many other real problems.But the MRM is not the best solution to these problems and often gives mens issues such bad press that its toxic to defend them. In other words its not the MRMs fault that these problems exist but its actively damaging to the cause quite possibly more than it has helped.Distancing itself from feminism breaks the gender equality world into mens activists and womens activists. This causes us to ignore that gender inequality is bad for everyone. No one wins when a man is arrested for being assaulted by a woman.\n",

They have only calories allowing me to supplement the meal in a number of ways without going over my daily limit.\n",

I do not think she is a great candidate for president but I also dont think she has any malicious intent that will harm the US for the long term. I agree that she should not have had an unsecure email server and the deaths in Benghazi could have been prevented. That doesnt mean that they were malicious decisions by Hilary alone instead of just bad decisions by a larger group of people. The Benghazi event was reviewed by multiple bipartisan committees and they concluded that there was an oversight but Hilary herself was not at fault.\n",

Im now a college graduate and living with my girlfriend in our own apartment but I still have no idea how a mortgage works I only have a basic understanding of political systems even my own in the US dont understand half of what my benefits from my job are and when I go to the doctordentist or whoever I either have to hope they can figure out how my health insurance works or I have to call my parents.Not once since college have I had to find an integral or derivative optimize the amount of string or fencing Id need continue reading old English classics or need to figure out how to balance a chemical equation.

      "126 j In Thomas Jefferson came out in opposition to a proposed National Bank for the United States. He didnt come to this conclusion after consulting with economic officials nor did he do any sort of analysis on what would work the best he didnt even consult the people of the US for their opinions. He simply argued that it was against the Constitution. In my opinion this was simply a copout and was devoid of any logical analysis on the pros and cons of whether a system would be for the betterment of the American people.Fast forward to today and you see the same problems. Ted Cruz is against the Supreme Courts gay marriage ruling not for calculated reasons on what works best for everyone but simply because of the Constitution.\n",
      "127 j People today justify abortions by saying Its my body I can do what I want with it. During the s people turned to the Dredd Scott decision which outlined slaves as property to justify their keeping of slaves and treatment of them.

Slavery and abortion each violate the basic moral principle that persons ought never to be treated as things to be used or discarded. When slavery was constitutional slaves were treated as property.\n",

However previous experiments have shown that it just does not work due to the key concept Marx himself proposed that in order for socialism to work the whole world has to be socialist. In this case I would propose countries like Russia Where I am from China and others who attempted at doing this but I failed. The counter argument would be that these states were authoritarian and never really had socialism. However that is the very issue which I have with socialism due to two reasonsFirst people are just not perfect enough to share all their work with others and live in communities where everything belongs to everyone and nothing to them personally.\n",

      "135 j Liberals are defined as those who are willing to respect and accept opinions which differ from their own. Furthermore liberalism as an ideology advocates being free from excessive restrictions within society. I believe gay marriage violates both of these.Marriage is a religious union a sacrament ordained by God. As such matrimony should be placed under the control of the Church as opposed to the State. Therefore the imposition of samesex marriage should be seen as an excessive restriction making it an illiberal viewpoint.\n",

      "141 j Recently I read this article discussing the impacts of Japans sexual apathy. One of the greatest impacts is the deficit of new born children. Japans reproduction rate is well below the necessary replacement rate of children per adult. If such a retrogression continues Japan will face extraordinary challenges in the future.In the midst of this crisis the Japanese are continuing to abort viable fetuses. If all of these unwanted fetuses were born the retrogression will certainly pull back thus possibly saving the country if not at least giving them more time to find a solution.Im most certainly not married to this idea and I would be glad to have my view changed.\n",
      "142 j This is clearly a controversial post so reading the post fully would probably be helpful.The main point I would like to make here is that gender unequal societies are just that gender unequal. Men and women in a gender unequal society have fundamentally different expectations from society and are assigned different tasks in society. In most cases as seen from history men were assigned most of the outside work and women were assigned most of the household work. Men were and still are expected to serve as the forefront of the military while women were exempt or at the backproduction line of the military. And clearly this kind of gender inequality has no place in .\n",

The common argument agaisnt the motion is the the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland UK doesnt own the Republic of Ireland. However that isnt what the motion is Britian is a land mass of the coast of North West Europe and whilist the UK is refered to as Britian that doesnt make Britain the UK.

      "147 j I went to a private christian school throughout high school and after college Ive been married to a wonderful woman who had the misfortune to teach at a private christian school for three years before she finally made the switch to public starting this year! Over that time Ive noticed some egregious problems with the whole idea of private school. Many of these schools are not run professionally. Many of the schools Ive seen and attended were not started as an academic venture but as a religious one. Parents from some of the local churches wanted a place were their children wouldnt be exposed to outside ideologies so they grouped together and started a school. The boards in charge of these institutions are not elected officials and not trained for the position.\n",

Dialogue that consists of terms and concepts such as patriarchy heteronormativity transexclusionary radical feminist TERF cisgendered gender spectrum gentrification respectability politics privilege oppression identity assimilation queer otherkin institutionalization marginalization etc....I could keep going.These are all terms that Ive just pulled directly from SJW Tumblr pagescomments. Some are more easily defined than others but there are still layers to each concept such as privilege or oppression that people may have a difficult time grasping if it was the first time theyve been exposed to these ideas.Honestly I have a masters and the first time this language was thrown my way I felt dumb for not understanding some of it. How might someone who could only afford a high school education feel? I get that they want to use intelligent specific language to explain some concepts that are difficult to put into words but how is someone who doesnt have the privilege of a college education or at least the time to sit down and learn these concepts expected to engage in dialogue that sounds like its spoken by a womens studies textbook?\n",

      "150 j There was recently a ban placed in my old high school of yoga pants due to their being too sexually revealing. I find that the most popular arguments made are based on this notion. It is either that the clothing is too revealing and is distracting to students or that it is too revealing for the age group wearing it. Ill tackle the latter first and I will argue that dress codes should be lifted such that you just need to follow normal public laws cant be naked in public cant reveal private parts in public ect.Firstly I believe what a child wears is both up to the child and the parents and in fact when outside of school this is the case. The school system shouldnt be deciding what is or isnt too revealing for an age group to wear and I would personally argue that a lot of what is considered sexually revealing is up to the interpreter.\n",

      "153 j I wont bore you with my life story but Ill give you a good idea of how I developed this thinking. When I was years old I was a college dropout but highschool grad and had no skills whatsoever so I moved from job to job a lot. I found myself hating my life at with no future or prospects so basically every day Id go to work then Id come home and play video games they are what helped me get away from the reality of life. On the weekends if I wasnt working or staying indoors gaming Id go out with friends. A friend of mine in Seattle was posting some nice pictures of his apt.car on facebook I basically started talking to him and we got to talking about jobs I basically said I wish I could do what you do man to which he said well you can learn and he basically talked to me about how he programmed and that most companies didnt require a degree but skill.\n",
      "154 j Before everything Im Catholic but Im open minded to different opinions and beliefs.Ive noticed that even nowadays where most people is liberal and open minded theres a gap in there. Apparently all those people hate religions and their followers and I start to think about. My only deduction about is that all religions arent perfect and have a dark side as the inquisition with the old Catholicism or the strict laws on Islamic countries like Saudi Arabia Not to mention terrorist attacks.But I think if someone have a belief and that doesnt affect you Why you should attack them like that?. They see religious people like uncivilized creatures its something that I cant understand at all.\n",
      "155 j Washington State Department of Transportation has implemented toll lanes on the existing Interstate road.They are bullshit.Here is a summaryThey have not added any additional lanes but instead painted a double white line splitting a lane highway into lanes. Previously the leftmost lane used to be a HOV lane requiring passengers or more to use with no toll option for single drivers. Now half the highway is or pay LexusBMWMercedes lane.I think this idea is a complete disaster.Notable points Ive gathered from reading about the change As far as I am aware the Interstate is public infrastructure paid for by taxpayer money. Crossing the double white line is a fine of something like dollars on a public road. In reading about the change it sounds like it was implemented to meet a federal requirement for funding of the HOV lane that the HOV lane move at a certain minimum speed.\n",

Whether its filibustering Bushs tax cut extensions standing up against Citizens United or proposing amendments to the Patriotic Act this is a guy whos politics match mine.That being said I find it problematic for a guy whos never sat as a Democrat and doesnt caucus as a Democrat to be running to be their leader. Reddit you can do it.\n",
      "157 j My friends family recently adopted a young girl in China but preceding this they had to take a test and go through some background checks to be sure that they were going to be good parents as one would hope. After he told me about this I started thinking that there are quite a bit of irresponsible and abusive parents who in all likelihood would never be able to pass a test of your responsibility. I feel like anyone who wants to conceive should have to go through background checks and take a test so that they can be approved as responsible enough to have children. If these were implemented I feel like there would be a huge decline in children with childhood trauma or broken households. More importantly its morally unethical to discriminate against samesex or infertile parents by making them follow a set of rules and background checks as they have to take tests to adopt while those with biological children can procreate no matter what.\n",
      "158 j To clarify lets say if youre under hours a week you cant vote. What I think this would do is motivate politicians to increase jobs rather than increase handouts for votes. The whole teaching a man to fish versus giving him a fish. Reasons why I think thisIf you dont contribute you dont deserve a say where the money goesPeople who dont REALLY need the help would try harder to find a job as oppose to being on government programs because it is now less attractiveWith less people burdening the system we would be able to better assist those who truly need itPoliticians gain nothing by increasing the level of government assistance instead of providing people with the means to support themselvesI dare you change my view.

Im arguing how theoretically if we could implement this society would be far better off for it and approach a nearperfect meritocracy.

      "164 j Drone warfare is clearly a hotbutton topic but to me it seems to be the most intelligent method of combat. While it doesnt replace the need for boots on the ground if you dont need to risk the lives of your own troops then dont. Once we accept killing as a fundamental necessity of war then drone strikes make the most common practical ethical sense. If you have a problem with indiscriminate killing or civilian casualties then your recriminations should fall on military intelligence. If you have a problem with military incursions into foreign countries than your recriminations should fall on failed diplomacy.\n",

Throughout the years Ive been living at home working jobs trying to get done with this degree so that I could leave already.Well needless to say most of my classmates are in the same boat as me. And for several years I thought I was the only kid struggling...until I discovered that half the class was in on a cheating ring.The professors are apparently very aware that cheating is quite rampant in our program. With a certain peice of information I could expose us all and have us reap our just desserts. This would kill my shot at grad school and sink everyone else but it would assuage my guilt and finally let me breathe easier.You might argue that what Im contemplating is selfish but what about this isnt?\n",

I want to give a few examples of what Im talking about taken from my time browsing this site People reacting to a female Thor. One user getting really mad at the possibility of a black James Bond. Controversy over the newest spiderman being halfblack halfhispanic.\n",
      "183 j For everyone who hasnt seen it you can watch it here Last Week Tonight with John Oliver Debt Buyers HBO .According to their description Companies that purchase debt cheaply then collect it aggressively are shockingly easy to start. We can prove it! What I watched seemed like a sensationalized piece that only succeed in saying that debt is bad and criminals are bad. There were some good points that they made in the show but I have made a list of all of the things that bothered me. The show talks how it is bad that debt collectors buy debt for a low amount possibly sell it for a lower amount and eventually try to collect it for the full amountWhats wrong with debt being sold for less than its worth and then collecting the entire amount? The reason it is sold for less than it is worth is because someone promised to pay a company for a loan but the didnt.\n",
      "184 j First off I am not homophobic or anything. I just genuinely want some clarification or debate on this topic.If you support gay marriage you must support polygamouspolyamorous marriages as well otherwise it is contradictory. I feel that the exact same arguments that are made for gay marriage could also be made for poly marriages.When many people began to call for gay marriage legalization the conservatives on the issue stated that it would violate the foundation of marriage their belief that marriage is to be between two fully consenting adults of different sexes. This was the general perception of marriage to many people at the time. However gay marriage advocates claimed that the general definition of marriage needed to change in order to respect the rights of a large portion of our society.\n",
      "185 j After a couple philosophy classes and some long winded discussions it seems as though many people find it hard to believe that free will doesnt exist in any real scientific way.Lets start off with premise Everything that is observable in the universe follows laws of nature. All laws of nature follow the universal law of causation which states that everything in the universe has a cause and is thus an effect of that cause. If premise is true then everything in the physical world must be determined. If everything is determined than there is no such thing as free will.If every behaviour is determined by laws of causation it is physically impossible for someone to be free as that freedom would require the nullification of the laws of causation. In other words to believe in free will is also to believe in spontaneous magic its to believe that humans possess powers that could only be explained by the supernatural.For example In most legal traditions it is customary to judge whether someone is guilty of x crime by accumulating evidence in order to prove that x person intentionally did this crime.\n",

      "189 j My position is that the U.S. government is responsible for healthcare being so extraordinarily expensive.The U.S. health care cost crisis didnt start until . The government increased demand with the passage of Medicare and Medicaid while restricting the supply of doctors and hospitals. Health care prices responded at twice the rate of inflation Source Now the U.S. is repeating the same mistakes with the unveiling of Obamacare a.k.a. Medicare and Medicaid for the middle class.Nobel Prizewinning economist Milton Friedman wrote that medical price inflation since has been caused by the rising demand for healthcare coupled with restricted supply. Robert Alford explained the minority view The market reformers wish to preserve the control of the individual physician over his practice over the hospital and over his fees and they simply wish to open up the medical schools in order to meet the demand for doctors to give patients more choice among doctors clinics and hospitals and to make that choice a real one by public subsidies for medical bills.\n",

      "193 j Ive had an argument with a friend of mine who is religious about the whole gay marriage issue I live in Washington where it is legal now and weve yet to fall into a pit of Oblivion. I brought up the separation of church and state and she said she didnt care and that shed vote based on what she believed as thats what she thought was the right thing to do.When I asked her why shes choosing this particular thing to make a stance on when she ignores so many other parts of the bible that include things that are not socially or lawfully acceptable her only answer was that she recognizes shes a sinner but is doing the best she can.That conversation aside which was an obvious copout on her part Im wondering how religious people in general in this country Christians can honestly feel like theyre doing the right thing when they just pick and choose convenient things from the bible to try to enforce while completely ignoring the things that are now seen as ridiculous. Does the bible list different things by priority? Why are religious folks allowed to ignore certain things but do everything they can to enfore others?\n",
      "194 j Many people talk about how they have hope. They hope that their situation improves or the cling to this idea called hope with the idea that their problems will take care of themselves. I like to consider myself a man of action and I cant stand when people use this word in this sense to me it seems as though people have given up actually making progress toward improving their situation and deciding that it is out of their hands. I predict that the story of a kid with a disease will come up and this is a tough one but realistically if I was that parent with the sick child there would be no Hope there would be action I would be doing everything I possibly could to help alleviate the childs symptoms make him more comfortable or raise money for his cause. To me hoping is like resting and assuming that something good will come from inaction.\n",
      "195 j To be clear Im talking about researchdesignprogrammingITcall center jobs where you arent in the public eye or arent representing the company with your physical body. If youre going and making house calls as an IT guy then this doesnt apply.Basically I think that its absurd to have a company tell you that only certain pieces of clothing are acceptable to wear to type on a keyboard or operate a phone. As long as the worker is getting their job done how they dress should be completely irrelevant so long as they arent distracting or offending other people at the office.To head off some arguments I dont believe that wearing a collared shirt and pants that arent jeans are representative that you respect the job any more than I believe that sweatpants and a tshirt are signs that you disrespect the job.What I think would change my view would be any sort of evidence that theres a benefit to having a workplace full of programmers or a call center always wearing slacks or skirts and nice tops.\n",
      "196 j The stalls in the mens room are underutilized as most men only need to use the urinal and theres a taboo against women using them. Stalls are closed anyway it doesnt matter who youre pooping next to. I can understand why men would feel uncomfortable peeing in a urinal with women in the room or women feeling uncomfortable walking past men peeing into a urinal society probably isnt ready for that yet but making separate rooms for urinals and stalls is a good compromise. The bathrooms should share a single sink area to make it more space efficient and make room for more stalls. This would eliminate all of the issues that transgender people encounter when they have to use public bathrooms.\n",

      "199 j I live in the US and come from a Shia Muslim family. We live in a fairly small city with very few Muslims. My family just like many Muslims living in the West is often subject to either dirty looks and suspicion or borderline creepy friendliness from strangers. The reason why Islam is so controversial in the West is because it is usually associated with ISIS and other extremist groups. Heres the thing though the vast majority of Muslims are not from the same sect as ISIS or AlQaeda or Boko Haram or basically any terrorist group Except Hezbollah which isnt a threat outside of Lebanon and Israel.\n",

The officer has no idea what the intent of the person resisting is or how far they are willing to go to avoid being arrested. The person resisting made a choice to resist They should be aware of the potential consequences of that decision.

Here are some reasons why I think they are better. Wired Mice are way cheaper.\n",

Ive been scouring google scholar trying to find studies but theres nothing that shows me in hard fact that most women who work as escorts are forced to go into it.\n",

      "210 j Ive long thought that affordable healthcare isnt really feasible simply because of the medical miracles we can perform today. Im not a mathematician but have done rudimentary calculations with the statistics I could find and at a couple hundred dollars per month per person the goal as I understand it we just arent putting enough money into the system to cover how frequently the same pool requires common things like organ transplants trauma surgeries and all that come with it years of dialysis grafts reconstruction chemo etc. as often as needed.personmonth not even affordable for many families of four etc. is person if paid until age . If you have significant problemshospitalizations over a lifetime a week in the hospital with routine treatment and tests that is spent. Then money is needed on top of that for all of the big stuff required by many... things costing hundreds of thousands or into the millions by the time all is said and done.It seems like money in is always going to be a fraction of money out. If thats the case I cant imagine any healthcare plan affording all of the care Americans will need and have come to expect.My view has changed somewhat or perhaps some of my views have changed and some remain the same.\n",
      "211 j Free will does not exist because we live in a physical world ruled by natural laws that cannot be broken. Chemical reactions proceed in entirely predictable ways physical objects move and react to each other in entirely predictable ways energy is transmitted and affects matter in entirely predictable ways.The last and weakest hope for the existence of free will is the subatomic particle which behaves in ways we are currently unable to predict. However in the past we were unable to predict many things that we now can and I believe the same will eventually be proved for even those things which currently puzzle us the most. Unfortunately for those who believe in free will there is no evidence at the moment that the behavior of those subatomic particles have any affect on the behavior of whole atoms or molecules thus they likely have no effect on the brain.You may feel you are in control of your actions but even you can find a causal link for all of them. For example in order to prove me wrong you decide to demonstrate a random act that has no reason or rhyme to it.\n",

To me calling Valentina Tereshkova the First Woman in space simply emphasizes her difference shes female instead of her accomplishment.If were all supposed to treat everyone equally regardless of race nationality gender orientation religious views etc wouldnt referring someone as the first whatever to do something simply remind everyone that the difference is still there and make it that much more difficult to ignore in the future?\n",

Laws can define where natural rights are legally applicable. But laws cant give or take away inherentnatural rights. Laws can however violate or protect those rights.There still must be a logical derivation of this right from nature if it exists.If Natural law derives from the nature of man and the world just as physical law derives from the nature of space time and matter. my question is how exactly is it that you are proposing the right to firearms derives from nature?It just does is not a sufficient answer.Explain why we have the natural right to self defense and how logically that right extends to include firearm ownership. Or the claim that gun rights derive from natural rights will remain entirely unsubstantiated.I actually think guns are the least of our problems and Im not really a gungrabber because there are a couple dozen things Id rather do first.\n",

Therefore in the absence of an observer there is no truth.The argument is deductively valid so the question is whether the premises are true.Truth as CorrespondencePremise is the correspondence theory of truth which goes back to Plato and Aristotle. To quote Aristotles famous statement To say of what is that it is not or of what is not that it is is false while to say of what is that it is and of what is not that it is not is true.One important point in favor of the correspondence theory of truth is that if someone claims that truth is something other than correspondence to reality then either their theory of truth is true in the correspondence sense or it is not.\n",

      "221 j So the crux of Trumps campaign Besides the whole Muslims thing that currently going off in the news is illegal immigration. Now yes they are breaking the law and I dont support illegal immigration but what would we honestly gain from deporting them?Lets look at the costs involved here clearly were gonna have to pay for the wall I dont care what you say theres no way in hell Mexico is paying for the wall or even chipping in. and thats gonna run us billions from the get go. Then to round up and deport all these people would require not only a beefed up border patrol on top of the wall but a gestapoesque force hunting down and deporting illegal immigrants which Im sure has a lot of potential for abuse and corruption. Theres shades of gray in both immigration and on the side of the force deporting them. But lets continue and assume they do their jobs well and deport most of the illegal immigrants.\n",

Although I accept that the internet has opened up a lot of mysteries and information to people that never would have seen before.Its probably just my incompetence at science and computing and lack of skills for doing really out there travel say climbing K that leads me to these thoughts and I dont know what my point is really but hopefully you get the gist and I hope to be convinced that there is more mystery out there nowadays!\n",

Short people have harder lives than tall people and society has done nothing to help them in fact many people still dont think heightism exists so short people should be exempt from all taxes.\n",

      "229 j In my opinion the size of the U.S.s defense force is a trademark of American society. While Ive seen in other posts that the idea of the uniqueness of American freedom is dead because plenty of other nations share the same levels of freedom America is still unique in the professionalism of her military and defense.I completely understand those who argue that the U.S. military is no longer fighting for the direct freedom of America and American citizens but I feel like what the military is actually doingsecuring the same freedoms that Americans have for citizens of nations around the globeis just as if not more important than defending only American citizens. I for one hope to see the world move more towards globalism and unite under international organizations and I feel like one large force keeping everything in check is necessary to do so.\n",

      "243 j As Castle Rock shows police officers in America are not obligated to protect anyone. They are instead obligated to protect property. Police in America have a long history of violent suppression of nonviolent protests conspiring to protect fellow officers through fabrication of evidence and perjury and being purchased wholesale by the elite as a private military. From Ludlow to Kent State to Seattle to Occupy police brutality is a common tactic used to disrupt protests by the disenfranchised. By legally placing property value over human lives the ruling class in America uses the threat of legitimized extrajudicial violence to maintain power and quell dissent.\n",

If there was a rape or disease then the abortion should take place right away and the punishment for the rapist increased.But lets be honest there arent even close to a majority of rape and birth defect screeners getting abortions. Yes it does happen but the majority are stupid people being careless and swinging by planned parenthood for a Plan B.The lack of responsibility should not result in a life being snuffed out and I believe that should face repercussions.

The center armrest could not be lowered as that would have prevented the person from even being able to sit down.pic It would have to be an objective measurement because simply saying this person looks too fat wouldnt go over well. And I dont think it would be feasible to go by weight a man who is and pounds would fit completely within his seat while a woman who is and the same pounds would be spilling out onto her neighbors. The objective measure could be shoulder width from the outside edge of the upper arm to the outside edge of the opposite arm as well as the same measurement for legsthighs.\n",

      "278 j A given longsleeved mens shirt assuming that the fabric weave color pattern ampc is the same as a shortsleeved mens shirt is a superior piece of clothing to said shortsleeved shirt.To clarify by mens shirt I mean a buttonup collared shirt designed to be worn by men i.e. shirts like this or this but not tee shirts or Polo shirts.My reasoning is as follows longsleeved shirts generally fulfill the same purpose as shortsleeved shirts while also having other uses and applications that shortsleeved shirts do not. Longsleeved shirts can be worn in a professional environment without looking cheesy or evoking a car salesman but can also be dressed down by rolling up the sleeves. The ability to roll up the sleeves also allows one to have variable sleeve length therefore providing a more versatile garment. Finally shortsleeved shirts have the stigma of looking silly or unfashionable that longsleeved shirts do not. For these reasons I feel longsleeved mens shirts are generally superior to shortsleeved mens shirts.\n",

Specifically Im a STEM major who will be going on to get my PhD in my major and have been doing research in my field.My issue is with the idea of providing Extra Time on tests for those with learning disabilities attention disorders and other permanent conditions. My reasoning is that these students are being helped in ways that do not reflect their effectiveness in the field. While there might be a system through which they can get extra time on a test in school the point of education is ostensibly to provide the skills for a career along with providing employers with an idea of an applicants capabilities. If there are two students one who used extra time and one who did not and they are equally qualified for a given position in most situations the applicant who can perform quicker would be preferred.\n",

You could change my view if you are prolife and admit that the term is just a euphamism as well as provide others who think along the same lines.Imagine you are given a choice between pushing a button and saving someones life or not pushing the button and thereby killing them. In this case the death of the individual is the result of your inaction and opposed to action.If you elect to not push the button is that the same as murdering them? You were perfectly able to push the button and save their lives. lets assume that whether you push the button or not there will be no repercussions for you except for any selfimposed guiltshameIn my mind healthcare is that button.\n",

      "283 j I am strongly for the idea that in order to have a prosperous and sustainable government it is absolutely paramount to have specialists holding public office in positions they have devoted their entire life to.

The environment secretary should be held by scientists leading research within the environment. The health secretary should be lead by doctorssurgeons who again are leaders and pioneers in their field.

      "288 j I have always been a climate change skeptic for a variety of reasons but I acknowledge that I have deep seated prejudices that drive a confirmation bias towards this view. Further I am finding it increasingly uncomfortable to find that most of the people I know who are climate change skeptics have other views that I really dont want to be associated with.Thus I would REALLY like to change my view on climate change and am very open to logical persuasion.Here are the reasons behind my skepticism about climate change and the value of government policies to stopreverse it I have strong libertarian views which make me naturally skeptical of any kind of government policies or actions. Thus I will always give a higher weight to news that is suspicious of climate change rather than news that supports it since I am very saddened by the idea of seeing government programs come into place to address climate change which ultimately impinge on individual freedoms to buy what they want use land how they want etc. Also the fact that so much of the research into climate change is funded by governments in one way or another casts a pall of suspicion over the results in my mind. It only makes sense that scientists who rely on taxpayer dollars would want to draw conclusions that would result in yet more funding.\n",

With gender identity I do not mean gender role as in ones behaviour as subjectictively placeableor notwithin the general social expectations of men and women respectively in the relevant culture nor do I obviously mean biological charactaristics. I also do not mean anything related to gender dysphoria insofar a persons high levels of stress are observable from the outside in how it impacts them. Also note that with gender identity I include things as nonbinary genderfluid no gender identity and anything which lies on the same axis as male and female.Essentially by definition is it not gender identity if it is observable through any other means than the subject telling you.

Sure it means that industries get moved into other countries but that job isnt lost its just relocated to a more efficient areaThat being said I dont really have an opinion one way or another about the TPP because I know that theres a lot more in it than just a simple free trade agreement.\n",

      "311 j Personal story here purely for context tldr at the bottomThis is something that is extremely personal and hits close to home. I was chubbyfat for pretty much entire life until university when I met a friend who happened to be your typical gym douche and... turned it all around.He was very much into fat shaming and had no mercy towards people who say I cant lose weight. And I told him on quite a few occasions that its honestly hard for people to lose weight and all sorts of crap about metabolic rate and how some peoples bodies want to be a certain size.Well since hes also an amateur bodybuilder he was bulking at the time. And one day he lamented his abs disappearing and hitting almost kg. I had no abs and I was almost kg I actually had a very similar shape to him at that stage.And of course he went on to talk about how it doesnt matter since after he cut down to kg itll all be worth it.\n",
      "312 j I just had a long debate with my friend about this and I came in with the thought that blacks and whites were genetically similar but all the evidence seems to say otherwise. For example African countries have horrible average IQs and normally I would explain that with the fact that theyre way less developed than the rest of the world. However we can take a look at countries with similar or worse human development and see much better IQs even Afghanistan has which is much higher than the average African IQ. The southeast Asian countries would be another example of this having similar HDI ratings but much higher IQs.The most damning evidence that really changed my mind was that according to a study by Minnesota university black children adopted by white parents STILL have lower IQs than white kids adopted by white parents. Even worse is that children with one black parent but adopted by two white parents have a higher IQ than children with two black parents but less than children with two white parents.wikiMinnesotaTransracialAdoptionStudyIts really hard for me to believe that blacks have inherently lower IQs and I really dont want to accept it. Plus the implications it has for society are huge so I would really appreciate it if you guys could change my view.\n",

But if you think that being converted to Christianity means you are literally saved from an eternity of suffering you should have gratitude not hatred for those who converted you regardless of the other shitty stuff they did. If I thought that someone had saved me an eternity of suffering by doing some of the most vile things possible to my ancestors andor to me I would still be greatful.Explain how Im wrong.\n",

      "331 j These people are definitely victims but in my opinion referring to them as survivors is in many cases overly dramatic. They might be referred to as survivors if their lives legitimately came into jeopardy if they were held at gunpoint if they were severely physically assaulted etc. but most instances of rape unwanted sexual advances isolated to a single instance do not come attached with a serious possibility of death. Rape is definitely one of the worst things that can happen to somebody but I think that survivor suggests that what happened to them was on the same level as living through a genocidal campaign a terminal illness a plane crash or something else of the sort. The former is bad but the latter are almost certainly worse. Rape victims calling themselves survivors takes attention away from more serious issues in which death is on the line.\n",
      "332 j As a father of two I regularly encounter nonparents who have strong opinions regarding how parents should raise their children. This is akin to a patient giving a physician unsolicited medical advice. Sure this patient has experience with both good and bad doctors has been under the care of a physician and been prescribed medicine and they may have even administered firstaid for someone in need. However if an established physician well into hisher career wakes up one day and thinks I really need some advice. Where does this physician go to attain it?\n",
      "333 j I just wanted to get away from all the politics on this sub and do something fun but that I firmly believe in and will NOT back down on.The vast majority of Mexican food is made up of the same basic componentsa tortilla cheese some kind of meat beans sour cream lettuce tomatoes. That is literally just served in different forms. Enchiladas have saucebut whatever spicy sauce they put on an enchilada doesnt have a real distinct flavor! Its just spicy! Tacos and burritos are literally the exact same thing except the burrito is closed up on both ends whereas the taco is more well tacoshaped. Tacos supposedly have special taco seasoning that literally makes whatever in them just taste like a burrito with a little cumin on it. I will concede that quesadillas are prepared differently and have a different texture since theyre flat but in essence have all the same stuff either inside them or on top of them.Go ahead and try to change my mind.\n",

A person is someone who is self conscious and a bunch more things not all people are humansIf we have human farms where no intelligence or reasoning is given to the babies they will be no persons.

      "335 j Dont get me wrong I love going to the movies but putting aside the early release factor I dont feel like there is any incentive for a moviegoer to watch a movie in a theater.When you are in the movie theater you have a lot of distractions going on around you. People talking phones ringing kids crying and the awkward battle for the armrest are some of the most frequent for me. In addition to that the seats my not exactly be comfortable for your body size there may be a tall guy sitting in front of you and worst of all you may have to go to pee but you have to hold it till the end or till intermission. All of these things are not a factor when it comes to watching a movie at home. No more worrying about other peoples phone ringing or kids crying.\n",

Schools and the government are all for decreasing obesity because it is unhealthy.I read that people want plus size obese Barbies and Disney princesses.\n",

      "359 j Lets not forget that Nazi Germany was the enemy of the allies and that the full details of the holocaust were not known when the powers first went to war.Hitler got himself on the cover of Time at one point.There was a lot of positive regard for fascist regimes amongst elite opinion in Europe and the US in the s.As the West in general won the war against the nazis but the west had committed similar atrocities a narrative had to be created that made the nazis seem uniquely and perversely bad which they were in fact in many ways and so the demonisation of Nazi germany served its purpose.But western regimes have enthusiastically supported regimes just as evil and murderous in the past years which shows that the official line is untrue.

      "360 j There have been several stories in the news lately that have provoked outrage over schools expecting students to gasp PAY for their lunches and vilifying schools for feeding students without the money for a hot lunch a different cold lunch instead.I feel this is an unfair assessment of the situation and that it is the parents and not the schools who are at fault. It is the responsibility of the parent to take care of the basic needs of their child and adequate foodnutrition is one of those basic needs. Sending the child to school does not absolve them of that responsibility and does not transfer that responsibility to the school.The most common argument I have heard is that children are required to go to school and therefore the school is acting as a parent for those eight hours and is responsible for providing for the students needs during that time. I dont find that argument reasonable for two reasons. The first is that the school is not responsible for providing any other consumable goods to the students pencil paper clothing etc. and it is unreasonable to arbitrarily assign the responsibility of nutrition to them.\n",

But why would a private business who is allowed to otherwise choose whatever customers they want be forced to accept customers? They should be allowed to turn away whoever they want to for whatever reason theyre a private business and dont need to provide a service to anyone if they dont want to. Right?For background Im an atheist so this is less about religion for me and more about the fact that I dont see why businesses should be forced to do anything regarding customers. If it were a government agency Im on the complete opposite side of the fence but for private businesses they should be allowed to do whatever they want.\n",

      "384 j Sexual assault is any type of sexual contact or behavior that occurs without the explicit consent of the recipient.When engaging in an altercation where one person purposely attacks the sexual organs of another it should be deemed as sexual assault. Including but not limited to the testicles. I dont know how to further explain this point as it seems common sense to me. But here are some points.The testicles are a sexual organKicking them is assaultPurposefully kicking them with intent to injure is sexual assaultIt could also be argued that if a man were to punch a woman in the vagina that hed be tried for sexual assault. As we understand from men and women regardless of reason women are much more sensitive psychologically.\n",

If scholarships or aid of any kind is unavailable then students should do everything possible to limit their debt especially attending instate public universities. Students who do need to take out student loans to pay for their education should at least attempt to work while at university in order to offset the cost.\n",

However they cautioned that it is not yet known if radiation hormesis occurs outside the laboratory or in humans.The U.S. is pushing hard to sway public trust in favor of nuclear power to the extent they are willing to downplay its very real dangers and risks and even lie outright to the American people. In the wake of Fukushima and a renewed pushback pronuclear lobbyists have attempted to convince the public that some small levels of radiation are harmless and may even be good for youbut Im far from convinced. To use the example of radiation in cancer treatment although some patients do recover and therefore benefit from radiation this comes at a tremendous cost to their bodies. You could argue that the person received benefit but not that the radiation did not harm them.\n",

I think those atheists who actively assert that there is no god the hard atheists like Dawkins are making an unjustified jump in logic andor belief. I am a soft atheist meaning I have a very definite lack of belief in a concept called god. But in contrast to an agnostic to me there is no possibility of being convinced that a god can exist. The idea of a god is too incomprehensible in my thinking.\n",
      "406 j This is a very common point I see when there is an atheism vs religion argument. Whenever religious people are asked for the proof of existence of God they counter argue by saying that God cant be disproved either i.e. there is no evidence that God does not exist. However the burden of proof always falls on the person making a claim and until that claim is backed by evidence the default is always considered false.For example if I were to make a claim saying that a flying unicorn exists I need to provide proof for its existence. My evidence cant simply be well you cant really prove it doesnt exist either. Until I provide proof everyone has a right to say that no such thing exists.\n",

This is both unfair and morally wrong. Im just wondering what the counter argument is to this position. As science progresses and we use it to continually benefit the human race I dont see how it is acceptable to bring a human who is nothing but a burden into this world When it is COMPLETELY detectable AND avoidable.Not looking for My brother has downs and I love him SO MUCH!

Even his advisors just respond to any accusations of racismIslamophobia with hes not racist he knows who the bad guys are etc. but still no plan just assurances.The same may be said for Hillary but I havent been following her campaign as closely and it seems likely she would just do what previous presidents have done surgical strikes at terror targets gradually expanding government surveillance powers etc..\n",

And even though I can find things online to support that or the opposite view none of it has changed my view since anything could be propaganda. But all I have known is that Israel has never been the cause of conflict and it is only through their skill ingenuity and destiny as Gods people that they have been able to withstand being annihilated. I understand this sounds dramatic but thats how its been related to me by people I trust no less.I want this view changed because I objectively know that there is very rarely a good side and an evil side.\n",

Often times but not always this comes from people like my parents and grandparents who tend to lean conservative but also sometimes from my friends at university as well. Im not sure what it means when they say its dying or under threat but from my own anecdotal evidence as well as talking to people from around the world and looking at statistics it seems in fact the opposite.Before we begin Im going to define western culture as the following. Media as in movies television series books news networks internet websites etc produced by western cultures.. Products designed and ultimately produced by western nations so even in iPhones are made in china or wherever they were created by a western company..\n",

This means that the form of a medium cell phone vs newspaper embeds itself in the message creating a symbiotic relationship by which the medium influences how the message is perceived.

He said that a medium affects the society in which it plays a role not only by the content delivered over the medium but also by the characteristics of the medium itself.With this concept in mind I ask that you challenge these statements.

      "421 j I believe that in our current society heterosexual men are often shamed for expressing their sexuality. Obviously any specific incident in which a heterosexual male is criticized may or may not be misogynistic based the context of the situation. So this post is mainly inspired by a recent event in the news when a fraternity was suspended for posting banners on their house. You can read about it here or here The basic summary is that a fraternity posted signs with the following messages in response the university president made the following statement equating the posters to condoning sexual assaultIt is my view that the banners posted by the fraternity are merely expressing their desire to have sex with women and never say anything about sexual assault. Equating the two is a fallacy and is unfair to the men who made the posters.\n",

There are however a lot of bad things happening in the world. For example in the ebola countries there are a lot of Christians. I am sure many Christians prayed to god for their beloved ones yet many of them still died. The only one who would be able to stop this is god and most of the time he didnt.\n",
      "423 j Currently in America rape is defined by the FBI as penetration of the mouth vagina or anus without consent and this definition is cited in national statistical surveys and research on rape. I disagree with this definition because it excludes men who are raped by being forced to penetrate someones mouth vagina or anus which is currently categorized as sexual assault. In a NYTimes article by describing societys blind spot towards male rape victims men have been or attempted to be made to penetrate in nonconsensual sex or receive oral sex but are not considered rape victims under the current definition.Legally men who are attacked this way cannot seek justice as a rape victim but rather as a sexual assault victim which may result in lower sentences for the attacker. Men made to penetrate may not be able to access recovery resources restricted to rape victims. Lastly this archaic definition may perpetuate equally archaic views on male rape such as men cannot be raped by women or an erection means consent even though erections can be an involuntary response.\n",

      "425 j My view is that anyone can get amazing at anything through hard work and practice. People who say they arent musical or artistic or clever enough are either making excuses or havent practiced enough. There is also the possibility that they are practicing the wrong way which I left out of the title because I didnt know how to phrase it such as trying to get good at guitar by learning only one very hard song assuming that will make you good at everything else.

I have plastered my town in signs to vote Yes on gay marriage and even defaced antigay displays not that this in any way legitimizes me. The anecdote is provided for understanding of my views.

      "444 j Before people make an important decision especially when they are going through emotional turmoil it is good to have an emotional appeal accompanied by facts to present the case of those who are affected by these cases. A common example is smoking cases. Cigarettes attract customers by portraying an aura of cool or to existing smokers by the emotional turmoil of withdrawal. The government sees fit to show the victims of this situation with graphic images of babies born to people who smoke tarcovered lungs and coughing children to emotionally appeal to the smoker to consider the consequences Another classic example is the image of Phan Thi Kim Phuc in the Vietnam war. War is a very emotionally charged subject and people naturally rally behind their country.\n",

When Superbad came out I immediately knew I loved the comedy and was laughing so hard my side hurt for a week. This isnt a new sensation but I cant recall a movie since then that has been as funny and still remains funny. Most comedies are promoted so heavily that by the time they come out you already have seen the funny parts and everything that cant be shown in previews is just a shock and vulgur play. Which is funny in the moment and maybe the first time you see it but doesnt last and gets overdone in the nd and rd sequels.\n",

Ive not been involved much in LGBT spaces in real life but Ive been planning to at the start of my current school year now that Im presenting female fulltime.My main beliefview is that it is probably harmful to continue adding to the LGBT acronym.

      "452 j When people distinguish between sex and gender they commonly refer to sex as a biological category which gender is a social or personal identification category. However I see why gender actually should be considered a distinct concept from sex. Here is why. gender is not a coherent concept without sex. I.e. if there was NO sex differentiation in human biology the concept of gender would be meaningless. This means that the concept of gender is inherently and essentially based on the concept of sex..\n",
      "453 j Im sure a lot of you have heard the argument often spread by certain historians that the US is a uniquely evil or brutal empire in its treatment of its citizens and the citizens of other countries and you can find plenty of polls and surveys to back that up. While I can be critical of the US to the level of borderline antiAmericanism I believe that the problems with the US are innate to the existence of a superpower and most of them can be found roughly correlating with power level as well as social progress in the histories of other great powers. Rome Victorian Britain Nazi Germany the Soviet Union every major incarnation of China Tsarist Russia the French colonial empire the French absolute monarchy fascist Japan the Tibetan Empire the Mongols the Romans the Persians Hellenistic Greece the Byzantines the Ottomans the Caliphates Aksum the Mali Empire Sokoto the Vikings the Aztecs and every other empire that has been able to project power at a continental or global scale has had many of the same traits that characterize the modern USpoor treatment of the lower classesinternational meddlingdeep divides language religion caste and more recently raceIt appears that these are inherent in being an empire and aside from being the sole superpower the US is no different than its historic peers aside from the magnitude of its influence.\n",

But if you say oh sir I didnt know that alcohol makes you make bad decisions its not rapeworknman brought up something I didnt think to address but I meant if someone says yes and has something in their body that they put in themselves that they knew makes them make bad decision its not rape. A drunk person can give consent if they consentually got drunk.So also if someone attempts to have sex with them and they say no and are too drunk to fight back its still rape because they didnt give consent.Im probably gonna get lynched for asking this but its basic courtesy. Please dont downvote everything I say just because you disagree please. Its very obviously going to happen but please just dont.\n",
      "463 j The cases of manslaughter that I am referring to are specifically those that do not involve intention to kill. According to Wikipedia some cases of voluntary manslaughter involve an intent to kill that is tempered by mitigating circumstances. I am not discussing those cases in this post. The cases I am interested in are those that involve no intent to kill Voluntary manslaughter where the intent was to cause serious harm but not death and the various forms involuntary manslaughter. There is a fundamental difference between manslaughter and most other crimes that I can think of If you can think of any that are like manslaughter then I probably have a problem with them as well manslaughter criminalizes the consequences of an individuals actions rather than the actions themselves.\n",

After they have served their time say they go to school to try to turn their life around only to find out that they cant land a job because of a stupid decision they made years ago. Even though they have served their due punishment the crime will follow them for the rest of their lives likely leaving them in nearpoverty and in many cases leading them right back to the criminal lifestyle for which they were arrested originally.Even in the case of something more extreme like a murder felony the punishment that society sees fit to put upon them has apparently been served why not let them get back on track if were going to let them live a free life anyway?As for raceethnicity I suppose I could see how this could be used for demographic reasons but making them state it in their application implies that it would have some sort of affect on the businesss decision to hire them.\n",

If we have begun to create self driving cars that can drive even in dark or rain then nothing is stopping us in creating drones or robots that sow and harvest fields carry food to our houses and place it in our fridges clean our streets plant trees create clothes and deliver them to our doors build houses etc. We could be living a world that a man from his birth he never once has to work everything he is is provided to him like a king.Without labor or without the fear of survival you could play games travel constantly around the world have the time to be with your loved ones read educate yourself be whoever you want to enjoy a very high standard of living free of malnutrition and disease.One of the factors that drove the immense societal development back in ancient Greece is the fact that free citizens didnt have to work as much because they had slaves to do the work for them so they spend their time philosophizing thinking and discussing something that we could be doing if robots took care for everything.Here is a video that could possibly be our reality in a few decades I am open to listen to your thoughts.\n",

However that doesnt change the fact that the laws exist and are the basis of my argument. For the people who do get uncomfortable around nude breasts a single father with his adolescent daughter or a mother with a teenage son or even some old stick in the mud curmudgeon I dont think its too much to ask to handle such things in private. Whether pumping milk or nursing at home there are ways of handling these things.\n",

      "488 j I am not claiming to be an expert on the subject but I have spent some time near inner city communitiesCincinnati OH and I have spent some time near very wealthy liberal communitiessouthern CA. Inner city communities do not hold similar viewsbeliefs that wealthy liberals hold. to over simplify it Wealthy liberals hold idealized views about social issues while inner city communities have more in common with redneck communities. In fact scholars believe that inner city culture is a derivative of redneck culture from the southgoogle it its fascinating and makes sense. The reason wealthy liberals love the inner city community is because they feel they are victimized and they vote democrat. The problem is they only vote democrat because they believe the democrats are going to increase their benefits but share very very little with them in terms of world view and beliefs. In fact if we could erase skin color and made everyone green then rednecks and inner city folks would probably be good friends because of their similar experiences and world views.Inner city people from my experience are openly homophobic and misogynistic.\n",

In this video at the main narratorinterviewee says that Deaf people as a culture have been marginalized largely. He then proceeds to postulate that perhaps buildings campuses and even cities should be designed with Deaf culture in mind.This statement got me thinking however about the usage of the term marginalized According to google marginalized means treat a person group or concept as insignificant or peripheral. So at what point does a group become peripheral?So I looked up statistics on how many Americans are considered deaf. According to the National Institute on Deafness About percent of adults aged to have disabling hearing loss.\n",

As far as my education has brought me Ive not been able to fulfill my end on the burden of proof.However Id like to know if theres evidence against such a claim for me to peruse some abstracts to read up on. It seems just based on what Ive seen Christian politicians having an edge churches being taxfree acts of terror in the name of religion things of the sort it seems like religion has a rather bad effect on the quality of life. I understand the individual benefits I think a shaky source once told me that faith can increase your lifespan up to years or so but Im really trying to grasp the big picture as best I can.If you have evidence FOR my claim some meta analysis of religion or something that would be absolutely lovely as well. Really anything regarding religions effect on society today would expand my mind.If youd like to know more about why Im leaning towards this point of view so you can change my view on that feel free to ask a bunch of random questions until you learn something.\n",

      "511 j Firstly my view only concerns itself with the God of classical theism which defines God as the absolutely metaphysically ultimate being. In other words this is an omnipotent omnibenevolent and omniscient God. Christianity Judaism and Islam all agree with this definition as a general rule.Secondly Im best described as an agnostic atheist and I only append atheism to my agnosticism due to my belief that the burden of proof is wholly on those who claim God exists and thus atheism is the default position. I am totally open to proofs of the existence of God anyone interested in philosophy should be.In essence I am not aware of a theodicy that is successful at refuting the deductive problem of evil and I can not personally conceive of one that is successful either. The problem of evil in question is best proposed through one of two ways the first being J.\n",

      "516 j Greetings fellow redditors Im conflicted about the morality of attraction. Perhaps due to the inculcation of the seemingly ubiquitous stance that personality traits are far more important than appearance I now feel guilt whenever my desire to date someone is based ostensibly on looks and sexual attraction rather than issues relating to character. To clarify appearance is never sufficient by itself for me to feel that a long term relationship is desirable. I often seetalk to people who are extremely good looking but with whom I feel no chemistry. However its also quite common for me to meet individuals that I find affable interesting and attractive in these situations after disentangling why it is exactly that Im drawn towards them I often find physical appearance sexual attraction also but really the two are pretty much inextricably linked in my view being the most prominent factor.\n",

There are two polarizing views either you believe in a God of some sort or you reject the belief that any deities exist.\n",

The only reason to live is to breed to continue the bloodline but if you cant die theres no need for that and if you cant die theres no need to eat anymore so really the only thing to live for would be to search for entertainment to stave off boredom if you dont feel boredom anymore why wouldnt you just sit contentedly somewhere doing nothing for all eternity?

Women nowadays behave like they all have prostitute or gold digger engraved within their DNA. Even when its just hooking up they always go after the best one or simply that one man that she is gonna get something special in return from.

I think these are both great things but the majority of my peers on FacebookTwitter are aggressively against it gay rights and the fact that the Confederate Flag is now in the spotlight and being frowned upon. A part of me wants to speak my mind about it and tell them how I feel to reason with them a bit but the other part of me thinks its a bad idea. Being vocal about my views could potentially cut off half of all people from even giving me the chance of meeting them and potentially being friends with them just because of my political views. I know a lot of people I consider friends that have political views that I dont agree with at all and I dont know if letting everyone know how I feel about these situations is worth ruining that.I have also heard quotes about how doingsaying nothing is worse than being against it and that during the civil rights movement most people were silent which was definitely a bad thing but Im not sure if its worth speaking up.\n",
      "529 j Firstly I should probably start by saying Im unlikely to inherit a large amount and my prospects of becoming a millionaire are slim to none. I was born and continue to reside in the UK of which I would say social class is very important.I guess my main annoyance is that it keeps the class system in place i.e. the rich inherit a lot of money and largely stay rich whilst poor people who struggle to get onto the property ladder would arguably need this money more. I think the whole idea of Im rich because Ive earned this money youre poor because youre lazy is outdated of which I would say is the main counterargument.In my opinion the majority of todays wealthy elite have had rich parents over generations possibly from the colonial days although I must add I have found no data on this. I believe that only a small fraction of wealthy people have worked their way up and it is a myth that if you try hard enough you can make it.I would love to see the day when this inheritance money is shared to try and make a fairer distribution of money.

But typically speaking people who are intelligent and hardworking can easily manage a household in a few hours a day and use the rest of the time to have fun with the kids like on an extended vacation. Let it be known I have no disrespect for people who take advantage of being a stayathome parent since I would do it in a second if my partner made enough money and was willing to work while lounged around and worked on hobbies all day after the kids were tended to.

When you feel like its time its time.\n",
      "534 j Basically as the title says. I think that parents who choose to have about five children or more are narcissistic and selfish. I would add it may be different if a person has twins or triplets etc. I think it is unfair to the children as they are receiving less resources from the parents such as financial or emotipnal support. I also think it is narcissistic for a person to think it is important to have more of their children roaming the earth than a regular family.\n",

I mention setting because its an important factor when do refs step in rounds etc.I expect Mayweather to keep in mind that he has a lot to lose undefeated title losing to a newcomer and maybe his own health? and to pull his usual stunt of dancing around and racking up points until the time runs out.\n",
      "536 j Just to be clear the word used here is gender as a social construct rather than the biological sex. ampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspampnbspI am in favor of destroying the idea of gender. Each person has their own perception of what gender identity is. When somebody tells me their gender note NOT sex I should not already be having ideas about who they are. Just because somebody is male I should not be assuming they like sports. Likewise I should not be assuming a person who identifies as female likes to sew.\n",
      "537 j Money buy experiences and allows one to follow the things they are passionate about. Want to help starving children in a third world country? Money would make that x easier which would make both the doner and the donee happier if they could see that come to fruition. Money allows you to care for yourself and if you dont have to worry about your everyday you can start helping others out. If you have a large sum of money that would be one less thing you need to worry about.\n",
      "538 j Pretty much the title. Im from the United States and a lot of people were generally angry that I believe this. Their main reasoning was that in many other countries the citizens have no say in who leads them or are forced to vote for one candidate and that my right to vote isnt something to be thrown away. If I dont support either presidential candidate or have a particular interest in voting for either one Id rather not vote for either instead of voting for someone I dont support. But there seams to be a generally unfavorable attitude towards nonvoters especially in older generations.\n",
      "539 j Even if a teleporter has a success rate there is no way to tell that your consciousness transfers. This is assuming that teleportation scans you at point A and recreates you at point B.If we get down to every atom being transferred exactly how can we tell that someones consciousness actually moved with the teleportation? By all outside appearances the person is the same even having the exact same memories. But it is impossible for that person to know if they are just a copy or not. The original consciousness dies upon teleportation and we can not prove that it doesnt.tldr Teleportation is just Ctrlx and CtrlV except your consciousness cant exist in the clipboard.\n",

      "552 j To my mind being rational means objectively examining evidence to reach conclusions and therefore only holding beliefs which can logically deduced from what we can observe. The very nature of religion necessitates its adherents to have faith meaning that they blindly accept a system of beliefs for which there is no real evidence. This means all religious people are irrational. There are people who attempt to reconcile their religion with science in various ways for example saying that the big bang happened but that it must have been caused by God. I argue these people are still thinking irrationally.\n",

      "555 j I havent watched any of the debates so far this year as they seem absolutely useless in picking a candidate. Soundbites and answers that avoid providing any real information dont help to determine who will actually be able to lead the nation.

Debating is a skill but it is not a skill that is needed to be President and the overemphasis on debates is likely to favor bad candidates then good candidates which harms the country.\n",

      "567 j This is not meant as a disrespect to most organized religions merely an observation i have come to.The widespread belief or following of most organized religions Christianity Islam Judaism is a sign of human weakness in a couple of ways. The need for an afterlife in most religions satisfies our general fears of death and the impermanence and futility of our lives. The theory isnt backed by much scientific evidence as far as i know so the reason to believe in an afterlife isnt that it makes more sense but that it makes life easier. A fear of death and impermanence so strong that one must believe in something that i would categorize as fairytale. This is what i would call a weakness.\n",
      "568 j So I have given this a lot of thought and tbh I have not really met anyone that really disagreed with me that wanted to prove me wrong so Im turning to the beautiful people on reddit.First Id like to start by making it clear that though I dont understand it I respect the personal choice the trans people have made. I believe that though I do not have to agree with them its not my place to question their decision and I certainly dont think the they deserve any less respect because of it. The issue often gets compared to gay rights but I dont get the comparison. Gay rights is a movement about removing legal barriers governing the interactions between two consenting individuals. It expands personal freedom by ensuring that no third party can interfere with the consenting choice of two responsible adults.It seems that there is a major issue surrounding the acceptance of transgenders in our society which often boils down to a bullshit argument about bathrooms when I think most people pretend to care about that in particular Thats a whole other discussion hahaThe issue I have found with allowing trans people to legally change their gender is one about removing the objective nature of certain aspects of our identity.\n",

      "581 j I personally think betrayal of trust is one of the worst acts a person can commit and should be treated as such. I believe that society as a whole only functions when we can trust those to whom we give power over others and that misusing that power needs to be protected against by making it clear that there are legal consequences for betraying our trust.However from what Ive seen it is often the opposite. In many cases it seems to me that being in a position of power or trust acts as a mitigating circumstance rather than an aggravating one. An example I see often in the news is a police officer committing a crime that would result in a civilian getting several years in jail but his only punishment being the loss of his job. This seems to apply to many positions of power not just police but not all.\n",

I think that protesting against the federal government should be a federal crime and protesting against state governments should be state crimes and protesting against local governments should violate local ordinance.

Therefor it is important that ones views on major issues all follow the same core thinking.This is why I find the platform of mainstream Republicans to be quite odd.The reasoning behind a belief that abortion is unethical goes as follows Fetuses are alive Fetuses are human All human life should be preservedWhile the reasoning behind the death penalty tends to be Murders deserve to die We can prove without any reasonable doubt that an individual is guiltyHere is where an inconsistency exists Why is it that the lives of fetuses are inherently more valuable than a criminal? How can the killing of fetuses be equal to the killing of a grown human if the killing of a criminal does not equal the killing of a different grown human? Can a respect for life be retained if you are in favor of killing the defenseless in the case of criminals?\n",
      "613 j This is in regards to the US. I cant speak for other countries.Ill have to begin by answering the obvious problem of critiquing the performance of teachers. Alongside this performancebased pay would be the removal of student assessment by teachers. Typical daily assignments would be graded by the teachers but tests would be administered and graded by a third party. This would create an unbiased view of student achievement which teachers would then be reviewed against. The better the grades students get the more the teacher gets paid.The current structure of teachers performance reviews and pay is severely broken.\n",

      "617 j In the wake of this atrocity a myriad of various opinions have been voiced both here on Reddit as well as the rest of the Web and the world. Among the most prevalent viewpoints is that Omar Mateen was motivated by his adherence to Islam. As an exMuslim Ive devoted a lot of time and thought to pondering the values and tenets of my former religion as well as scanning various online forums pertaining to Islam and atheism. The Orlando shooting has actuated the expression of different comments such as Religion of peace? LOL or This is why Islam is evil to the core.\n",
      "618 j Parents who choose not to vaccinate their children because of an antivax agenda assuming the child has no MEDICAL reason to not be vaccinated are in my opinion guilty of child neglect borderline abuse. They are neglecting to protect their child from harm and purposely putting their child in harms way neglecting the childs safety entirely. Going along children SHOULD NOT be allowed to attend public school without being properly vaccinated. Once again assuming their is no medical reason autoimmune disorders to not be vaccinated. Parents who deny facts and put their children and others in harms way because of this political agenda is in my mind similar but worse than a parent that doesnt bring their child to the doctor when the child breaks its leg.I honestly want to know the reasoning behind people who disagree with what Im saying.\n",
      "619 j Shooting should not be sports in Olympics especially when sports like Cricket Bowling and Chess are not in it which are all really popular perhaps even more so than shooting. Shooting requires almost no physical strength its really a matter of having steady hands and good aim. Physical strength should be an important part of any Olympic sport because thats what the Olympic is in my opinion. Its an event where competitors after years of training break the previously known limits of the human body in creative and entertaining ways which Shooting isnt. In fact it seems that shooting ability is hard to quantify and that some amount of randomness might be involved as was the case with Ginny Thrasher who seemed to unexpectedly get the Gold medal.\n",
      "620 j In my view this accomplishes multiple things at once. First of all it is fair. As it stands traffic tickets are a regressive tax that harms poorer people more than it does those that are well off. You should not be punished more or less for the same mistake just because you have more or less money. I am aware that the rest of our legal system functions in this way in that richer people can afford better lawyers and legal teams to come to their defense but this does not mean that in this section of law it is acceptable.\n",
      "621 j These companies are here to get us by when things dont go to plan financially in our lives. They are short term fixes here to help us yes they are a business but like many they are here to provide a service to those in need.The newstragic stories you here about people committing suicide and going into severe depression when behind on payments is no fault of the companies lending money. They clearly set guidelines and warn customers of the consequences of not repaying and it is only down to the incompetence of those suffering who dont bother to read understand the consequences of not paying on time or at all before binding themselves to a contract.Also I dont see why legal loan sharkspayday loan companies are frowned upon and chastised as immoral and repugnat when in reality they give similar punishments as banks do when their customers dont pay their mortgages. I dont see how repossession of ones home is more moral than extortionate interest rates. If we look to ban loan companieslegal loan sharks on the basis of immorality we should ban mortgages too on the same basis.Pay on time and everything is fine and both you and the company have fulfilled your contractual obligations.Dont pay on timestalldont pay at all then Im afraid you deserve everything that comes to you.\n",
      "622 j This is something Ive been thinking of as we just got through elections in my country. I had a discussion with another politicallyactive person and something I said bothered me later that I respect a particular party because they wont compromise their views by being a junior partner in a coalition this specific act isnt what Im arguing its just for background. A politician doesnt exist to push their views its to represent everyone in their constituency. It shouldnt matter if for example a prolife candidate was elected to a constituency that was mainly prochoice or viceversa they dont get to put their opinions above the ones that elected them. Theyre meant to judge for themselves the solution that best fits everyone not one particular demographic and no matter how horrible or impractical the compromises required are.\n",

      "631 j At an individual scale due to the bonds we form by living within the society we created we develop compassion which appears to be the reason why the weak in terms of values but also physical constitution are not left behind. Leaving morality aside from a utilitarian perspective it appears the hindrance on progress outweighs the happiness of the few who cannot keep up. In nature this process is wildly spread trough natural selection. To change my view argue that universally speaking solidarity and compassion are more beneficial to progress than Nietzsches philanthropy.\n",

It should be answered once and for all not on a case by case basis.\n",

By doing this eBay are trying to force sellers to satisfy of buyers. Because there is some irreducible percentage of buyers who are unreasonable this is never going to actually work. Getting an unreasonable buyer is random and accordingly there will be sellers who get pushed out due to nothing more than the bad luck of getting several unreasonable buyers in a row.

I think it shows that there is something wrong with our cultural values and our priorities that we are willing to throw millions of dollars at sports persons Second Im not saying that we should stop fun and entertainment nor am I suggesting that we should enforce rules to make private citizens not pay money to sportsmen.

      "649 j COP is upon us and with it comes much consternation about how we as a species will tackle climate change. To be clear I believe in climate change and that it is largely caused by human activity. However I also believe that with globalization and the rise of the rest that it is unrealistic to believe we will cut global consumption to a level that reduces or reverses climate change. I wont go into the arguments of developed vs developing countries right to pollute although I believe that this plays a role as well.With so many factors working against meaningful action to stop climate change I believe our best bet is to address our growing energy concerns and develop infrastructure that will allow us to adapt to a changing environment seawalls and the like.I really want someone to .One thing I learned from this thread is that the reasonable arguments for how we realistically deal with climate change tend to get drowned out by people screaming the sky is falling and we are all going to die.

Theyre both things I wouldnt do myself. And I dont think the state should be in the business of marriage in any form.WhyI was thinking about polygamy and gay marriage and realized I couldnt think of a single argument Ive heard for gay marriage that doesnt apply to polygamy. The most notable among them being the base case that just because you think something is wrong doesnt mean that you can enforce your worldview on others.\n",

Now then lets take a look here and analyze who at the moment makes up the majority of Nintendos market share. If you analyze the list of bestselling games on the Wii including Wii Sports Mario Kart Wii Wii Sports Resort New Super Mario Bros. Wii and of course Wiifit youll see a trend These are all games that were either created FOR casual players or very casual entries in an existing series. For instance Mario Kart Wii is easily less difficult than Double Dash and certainly less than Mario Kart DS. Yet when you compare the units sold with DS hitting . million versus the Wii version which sold . million its clear who the winner here is.\n",

That said a democracy cannot function when the average voter is so illinformed. This is being bore out in our national politics more and more every year with voters sending representatives that mislead and flat out lie about basic facts.I see nothing that will correct this naturally in the coming decades and it will eventually lead to a complete collapse of our government. Eventually the areas being held back by this ignorance are going to say enough is enough and succeed or a enough competent fascists will be elected to change the system towards their goals.A republic is a form of democracy.\n",
      "689 j I think in the popular sphere of internet discussion gender body image and LGBT issues cultural issues are overdiscussed relative to far more important issues of economic equality and to a certain extent environmental issues which will have much more lasting impacts on our society. This is important because economic conditions largely underpin the overdiscussed issues.First and foremost I am not saying these issues are not real nor problematic. They certainly exist and affect people everyday and honestly I am happy to see them being discussed at all. However in recent years Ive noticed the amount of discussion around things like womens body image transgender rights and mens rights increase exponentially while issues like poverty inequality and climate change only emerge on my facebook feed occasionally. While my FB is a terrible sample I think a similar conclusion can be drawn from looking at debates on Tumblr Reddit etc.This concerns me because things like rapid car growth and urbanization in China are going to have far more consequences on our lives than issues like whether or not thin privilege is a thing.\n",

Someone who so desperately wanted to be seen as the opposite sex that they went to extreme measures months of hormone therapy surgery and recovery. Now theyre finally happy in their own skin. Itd be miserable to dig up a past better left forgotten every time they become intimate with someone. I can absolutely empathize with this perspective so Im looking forward to your arguments.\n",

Of course we are all individuals with our own views prejudices and biases but shouldnt people who profess to live by Jesus example want to help the poor in the form of welfare as well as charity?I know the main argument is that charity can help the poor more effectively but I dont know all the figures and whether this is actually true I doubt charity would raise as much as welfare budgets. It also seems that there is an element of control in charity by throwing around charity money weight the church can gain influence and set up religious indoctrination as a sidemenu to whatever charity project is being done.Is it just that most of us are drawn like magnets down the liberalconservative line or is there some defined reason some christians oppose welfare?\n",

      "721 j TLDR Whether your outsider candidate loses or not you should support both in at least the hope that they can beat back the corruption in our political system before it swallows our democracy whole and we never get a true peoples candidate ever again. Once our system is restored then the next election we can vote truly on policy. but for now this is strictly just to survive.Regardless of how you feel toward either Donald Trump or Bernie Sanders I believe they stand for something greater than either one of their most radical policies. Both are two candidates that at least as far as anyone can tell are willing to spit in the face of the elitist corporations puppeting of the government and clean their hands of dirty political money. They will carry out their own interpretations of government policies but more importantly will take measures to wrangle our political systems out of the influence of the corrupt and the obscenely wealthy.Now whether or not they truly hold this position as something they will fight for once elected or whether it is just a big show to get them through the front doors I dont think we can truly know. But judging by the violent reactions from both ends of the spectrum in suppressing them I am willing to believe their threats carry some weight.I also realize that the policies campaigned by both candidates are yin and yang respectively.\n",

First of all if this person really wants to die they can just jump off a bridge shoot themselves or cut their wrists. They arent going to care if its illegal when theyre dead but its a huge mess and the person doesnt get to die peacefully.Secondly under current law you can just go to a different country or state and get this life ending medication why not skip the bullshit?Lastly the person is seriously suffering their family is suffering and youre purposely making their life much harder.\n",

We all do.

      "746 j Equality is one of a number of concepts referenced regularly in Western political discourse others being freedom fairness and so on but Im increasingly troubled by the pursuit of it in politics.Usually people dismiss this objection as a confusion between equality of outcome and equality of opportunity. The former is something I rarely hear supported but is at least unambiguous in its meaning everyone has the same life quality in terms of health wealth education etc. Only people with a view of the world heavily slanted towards nurture believe this is possible and most accept it is beyond the remit of government to achieve it so far as I can tell.But equality of opportunity despite appearing to be meaningful at first glance is actually nonsense or at least as ambiguous as equality. Does this mean starting everyone from a same footing which would involve compensating for background and genetic discrepancies or simply applying the same provision to everyone? I dont view it as within the power of the state to arrange human affairs so that every child can have an equal chance of prospering at school and even if it was possible I think the destruction of freedom and family life it would entail would be deeply wounding.\n",

      "750 j This is a view Ive had since I was a youngin appropriately so as it does sound childish but hear me out.Im imagining a world where soldiers do not exist first however it would be helpful to define exactly what I mean by soldierA soldier by my perspective is an individual who willingly or unwillingly is assigned to serve in a nationally provided army.So they cease to exist. Please try to imagine this hypothetically not practically. I am fully aware that millions of people losing their job at once would be outrageous.Lets start so what would be the most noticeable differences? Well I believe that Countries would become powerless against one another and thus way more peaceful Citizens of countries that are generally pleased with their lives would not be warmongering further pushing the above point High ranking politicians would be unable to cause the death of innocents because of a dispute with another country If a dispute arises between countries at least it would be brought on by the citizens and the blame would fall upon themselvesI understand that some or even most people become soldiers to defend their country but if a country so wishes those same people could become tools of war fighting a war they would not agree with if the veil of inevitable propaganda was lifted.Ultimately I am aware that something like this is not feasible but it does make me question if i should respect soldiers in the first place. Theres such a strong push for respect towards people serving the country yet really those people could easily become killing machines for the sake of a stupid argument on a politicians telephone.\n",

      "754 j Where I went to school Australia we are taught that there are continents which are as follows North America South America Europe Asia Africa Australia and Antarctica. I believe a bit of common sense will tell you that there is in fact which would come about by combining Europe and Asia as there is an acute lack of an ocean dividing them and should therefore be considered one and the same Eurasia.Most people will tell you that they are divided because of such a huge cultural divide but I think that that argument is flawed in that many completely different cultures exist on the same continent e.g. China and the Middle East. So if we were to choose the number of continents based on culture there would be an endless amount of completely subjective possibilities which means that this method is irrelevant.One might argue that if we were to ignore culture and combine Europe and Asia we would also have to include Africa to create a supercontinent and we would have to combine North and South America to make the Americas for arguments sake lets forget about the Suez and Panama canals. However I would argue that this is different as the land bridges between them are vastly smaller.So change my view it makes much more sense to have continents rather than .\n",
      "755 j When a large organization lays off workers because their jobs are obsolete labor unions and politicians always get really angry. They make pleas like This hurts the middle class! and How are these people going to feed their families?It feels insensitive to say this but these are emotional arguments rather than rational ones. Theyre arguments with which I sympathize as someone whos seen friends and family struggle with longterm unemployment after getting laid off. But theyre arguments that serve only to make people feel better they make no difference in the overall trend toward automation.Jobs exist because work needs to get done not because employers want to feed peoples families. If the work can be done cheaper by a machine than by a human then its foolish and ultimately futile for an organization to keep using human labor.Im a liberal.\n",

However a child who goes to a private school and benefits from this education has not done a great deal to earn or deserve it although they may have passed the entrance exam their parents also need to be able to afford the fees.

And since its related to the topic I have never had sex never kissed a girl but I have gotten physically close to some of them. If pressured on it I would admit that Ive been in love as well.Im here to answer any qualifying questions.\n",
      "771 j I know this isnt the typical post but I need to get this out. This is my first submission here so hopefully it fits within this community.As many others can relate Im sure my grandparents have been a HUGE influence on me since my early days between sitting teaching me things that my parents hadnt such as how to hold utensils properly and being there for me in general. Even in my late twentysomethings I get money from them at Christmas. goes a long way when pretty much living paycheck to paycheck.I was close with them as a young boy but over the years have drifted apart in part because we havent always got along during these times mainly due to our differences of faith and politics. I wont go too much into detail but while the various disagreements and exchanges over the years have affected my opinion of them they have come a long ways by being openminded about our differences. That part doesnt seem to be much part of the equation because in the end I love them and they love me and we are family.\n",

A fine should be well enough. with the laws preventing people from feeding the homeless or really anyone in public iirc.\n",

      "804 j This viewpoint has most likely hurt me a lot more than it has helped me so Im hoping someone can change my view here.I feel that being confident or behaving in a confident way shows that you are sure of your beliefs and actions. I also believe that this is reprehensible. Your ability to learn and be edified I feel is directly hindered by selfconfidence.In my experience I have learned so much more by questioning what I already thought or did as opposed to being certain of myself. I often find that the most effective means of approaching a situation is to consider as much about it as I can and tentatively operate on what conclusions I do draw but constantly questioning those conclusions until either they work for me or no longer hold water. I think that there is no such thing as overthinking and that any situation can only ever be improved by careful consideration.Consequently I see people that display confidence in themselves and their beliefs as almost intentionally maintaining a blissful ignorance.\n",

      "809 j So yeah. Kind of an unpopular opinion right there.Basically I fail to see the difference between pedophilia and homosexuality or heterosexuality for that matter besides the subject matter. A pedophile is simply someone who is attracted to children.The common view seems to be that pedophilia is a disorder in fact its classified as a psychiatric disorder rather than an orientation or a paraphilia. I think this seems unfair there are likely thousands if not millions of good citizens of the world who are struggling to get by as closet pedophiles deemed to have a disorder by the doctors of the world.Surely a pedophile who has no inclination or possibility of molesting or abusing a child is just as functional in society as a homosexual if not a heterosexual? Why then is pedophilia the paraphilia itself touted as a disorder and pedophiles thought of as needing theraphy or treatment for their condition?\n",

If a kobold has a drop rate of an item but a troll has an drop rate and I can only pick enemies total to hit looking for the drop logically Im going to mostly go after the trolls.It really doesnt matter that the trolls have a higher drop rate because they cant afford fancy backpacks that keep the loot from falling out or that because of their religion they wear the item on their head so its easier to find.... the fact is you have a higher chance of getting the item from them than you do the other enemies.It sucks for the vast majority of people who are innocent and meet that criteria but its not like were permanently impacting them theyre facing a minor inconvenience at the airport or during a traffic stop. I think people get offended by it because they feel it somehow means theyre a lower class of person because they get picked on... it doesnt.... it just means the team you play for has higher bad statistics and you should work to help change that if you dont like being picked on. Life is not fair but looking at it black and white and ignoring feelings I believe this would reduce crime.Maybe if one group got sick of being picked on and worked together to reduce their stats the runner up group would start getting targeted as they would replace first place for most likely to do X.Now do I think they actually should profile?

      "827 j Recently my World Empires class was discussing th century enlightenment philosophy specifically John Locke and the French philosophes like Voltaire and Rousseau that advocated for inalienable rights given to each man at birth. Now this is very important because in his time John Locke was considered a radical liberal to suggest the concept of tabula rasa equality and the rights of the people. The French began to adopt this idea and this resulted in many political conflicts to loyalist types who could never really put down the rebellion. My professor said this was because Once the toothpaste is out of the tube you cant put it back in. What he means by this is that once a right exists and is widely accepted it cannot realistically be removed from the people who want it.\n",

The reason I think they should seek psychiatric help is because it seems to be a reversion to a younger age type thing in my book. Ive only taken an intro level psychology course in high school but one thing I learned was that trying to revert back to a more immature age is a sign of frustration or anger at themselves. TLDR Its a kids show and I think that the people who watch it have actual mental issues including frustration towards their own lives.\n",

What I am willing to argue is that benefits of being a Jack of All Trades far outweighs the benefits of being a master of one or few trades.For starters the possibility of finding the thing that truly makes you happy and satisfied in life is lessened quite significantly if your endeavors are honed into a certain subject at an early age. The amount of time you spend on a certain skill hobby or whatever it may be is inversely related on the amount of time you spend on other aspects of your life. It is my opinion that when you decide on your calling and devote yourself almost entirely to it you miss out on other precious and interesting opportunities that your life could include otherwise.\n",

I have tried to read a spread of posts on the topic on rphilosophy raskphilosophy and here as well as looking at some arguments more directly from philosophers but I havent been convinced by anything and more and more I am thinking that philosophers are being dishonest with themselves and society by claiming that moral facts do in fact exist.Let me start with an example of an argument that I dont find convincing branch off into what I think moral claims really are and then address a few points that I think will come up.One argument possibly from ShaferLandau is that there is a clear distinction between someone choosing a restaurant to eat at and raping and murdering a child. We dont care about the first nearly as much as we care about the second which suggests that the first is a matter of opinion while the second is grounded in reality. But I dont find this convincing because I believe that all moral claims are simply stated preferences about how we want people to act with some preferences having more weight than others.\n",
      "871 j Seeing as how all my friends cant shut up about Breaking Bad after the finale and everyone tells me I HAVE to watch it I thought Id give this a try. I am a high school psychology teacher and definitely enjoy my fair share of TV and movies and I love a good story but one of my pet peeves is ridiculously unrealistic portrayals of science and education. Poppsychology is everywhere thats a whole other topic but I think education has a special place in my heart. It is often underappreciated and not often portrayed in film. The few times that it is however are extremely far from reality.\n",
      "872 j To start it off Im not an Apple hater. Im typing this on my MacBook Pro right now. I am shopping for a new phone and I am open to getting an iPhone if I can be convinced. But it just seems like its a Sega Genesis and Super Nintendo debate where there are two big flagship competitors but really one has been edging out the other.Screen Size Samsung has always been ahead in this department and it took apple until their th of phones to catch up. I dont think bigger is better but having for most of the past several years was too small and it took them a while to present an alternative to the Note or even the Galaxy S series.\n",
      "873 j The notion that bad ideas wont survive is simply false. Communism is a bad idea and yet large numbers of young Americans support it. Racism is a bad idea and it still lives. Social Justice TM is a bad idea and its becoming more and more prevalent. Censorship is a bad idea.\n",
      "874 j I like dogs a lot currently own one and have owned dogs before. Im pretty good at training them with positive reinforcement. That said I roll my eyes when people think of dogs as naturally sweet little angels superior to nasty humans. My view is that the common saying Theres no such thing as bad dogs only bad owners should be turned on its head. I think all dogs are bad by nature especially in a utilitarian sense to avoid the argument about animals not having morals.\n",
      "875 j Could someone help a cisgendered white male understand why critics and people alike are raving about the new Wonder Woman movie? Having seen the movie myself I really just dont understand what all the hype is about and when I think about this movie I seem to think about three main points that I just cant get around the movie felt formulaic the music was subpar and predictable and finally the movies role in relation to my current ideas of gender.Wonder Woman felt formulaic This is one of my main criticisms of the movie and I think it has come from the movie market being oversaturated with superhero movies as of late. Other than the first two batman movies and maybe the third I laugh at the relative quality of DCs liveaction movies compared to their Animated Universe counterpart. Wonder Woman does what every other superhero movie has already done the only difference was that it was a female lead which Ill get more into later my complaint was the result to me felt uninspired and the execution of the scenes was unoriginal When viewing many of the fight scenes in this movie I was reminded of The Music Felt BlandAs a musician myself I feel the music also played a large role in my lack of interest. Id like to start off this point but suggesting readers watch this video here to get a better understanding of where Im coming from on this point.\n",

Would you really take away the rights of some people? The same rights that homosexuals have fought so hard to get even interracial marriage some time ago.Im definitely open to changing my mind but right now I see nothing wrong with it.PS.

      "883 j Following Frances election of Macron over Le Pen it was viewed by many pundits as a rejection of farright xenophobia. But my view is that leaders like Le Pen are the only ones who are willing to go far enough in addressing what is a massive problem for Europe. There are huge communities of recent migrants that are not integrating into society and the second and third generations dont appear to be any more integrated than the first. I worry that importing millions of people every year into Europe who have fundamnetally different worldviews on issues like sexism antiSemitism free speech and liberal democracy is a threat to European values. Im scared of what Europe will look like in another few decades if immigration remains loose and I feel like we need strong leaders to stem the tide.\n",
      "884 j I really dont like this aspect of my personality and would love people to give me some examples of why this prejudice is massively flawed. Im not talking about people who are a little overweight people like food. Im talking about scooters in the supermarket and walking sticks for getting to the car. People who blame hormones or metabolic rates are trying to find external justifications for their predicament. I knew a girl in school with a genuine hormonal problem which caused a puffy face and water retention.\n",
      "885 j I dont agree with people who choose to discriminate against gays or any other group really and Im certainly not against various individuals or private groups boycotting businesses that have these practices but Im also unconvinced that government intervention is necessarysolves the problem. For one the vast majority of business wont know they are serving gays. Things like wedding plannersetc. are one of the few exceptions and I have a hard time believing that so many wedding planners are homophobic that gays wont be able to get that service. Not to mention that fact that unlike with black segregation failing to get a wedding planner is not such a serious issue as being unable to buy your groceries at any store in the town.Basically while I think the individuals who choose to discrimnate are despicable the issue seems like it isnt serious enough to warrant large scale government intervention and in this case let the bigots be bigots. The tide of social acceptance is changing in the country and they will go away on their own without us forcing our views on them.\n",
      "886 j I am referring to household income whether its two minimum wage parents making k combined or one parent earning k alone. Basically I am referring to the jobs you can get without an education or trade school.A single parent cannot afford to raise a child on a blue collar wage.A married couple cannot afford to raise a child on a single persons blue collar wage in many but not all cases.Compared to to years ago it is much more expensive to live by first world standards than it used to be. to years ago you really just needed food shelter and clothing and of course an education.As living things we still really only need the same things but to survive in the first world above what people consider poverty here you need the followingTransportation your own if you live in a rural areaA cell phone. Good luck getting a job without one.A computer and internet connection.Health insurance.and Im sure you guys can add many others.Its comforting to think about how we live like kings today compared to or years. All the technology we have that makes our lives better and more enriched.It comes at a price though.

      "894 j If you find yourself uninformed about representatives or issues you should not nor should you be encouraged to vote. This to me seems common sense yet in many or most elections people are attempting to get people to actively vote who otherwise would not such as teachers giving extra credit for voting or businesses offering incentives to employees who vote. I understand people should be encouraged to understand the issue at hand and to research representatives however people who do not should not be encouraged to vote. The reasoning behind this is simply that these choices should not be made at a spur of the moment or without conviction as then we get representatives voted in who hold no qualifications but who the voter may have heard of once or twice.

      "896 j The Republican party seems determined to and may indeed repeal the ACA aka Obamacare.

For years there has been no viable alternative plan that addresses actually covering the population. The philosophy necessarily means that if youre poor youre fucked or at least youve got tough luck.As a wealthy liberal I believe in equal opportunity and building a fair and healthy country with healthy citizens.

It also ensures yhe demure students are disproportionately concentrated with other demure students so that none of them are likely to lose that social drawback.\n",

It gives new ideas online businesses and upandcoming siteslike Reddit was twelve years agothe opportunity to find an audience and grow on a level playing field. He also references big cable as directly opposed to this idea and implies that they are only opposed to it for the money. What he fails to mention is that if net neutrality does come into law sites like reddit will likely have to pay large amounts of money due to the amount of bandwidth they use directly impacting their bottom line.\n",

This is pretty much my entire argument but Ill clarify my position Whenever a post on reddit discusses this issue some posters often go for the appeal to emotion saying its not part of a civilized society. I dont think this really holds because it does not say what about it makes it uncivil. Other posts that sometimes come up are when a child molester is killed by another inmate.

People talk almost exclusively about the material at hand. All the talk Ive seen about gender in STEM comes from outside the field people complaining that there arent enough women for example.

      "946 j A potential President Pence would largely be free from the Russia investigation and could work with the Republican legislative majorities to repeal the ACA enact tax reform etc. as opposed to the standstill President Trump has created by going on Twitter rants making bombastic claims and insulting anyone who dares to contradict him in the slightest. However several Democrats and many pundits have called for Trump to be impeached including a Representative from California who filed articles of impeachment against the President.I believe that it is better strategically for Trump to make the US look ridiculous until he is voted out of office in but still not have many major Republican legislative victories than for Trump to be removed and let Pence be able to govern the country with Republican control of the legislative branch. Democrats seem to lean towards the possibility of the latter especially since a Republican Senate would likely acquit him should he even be impeached by the House so it really seems like a waste of time to go through with any sort of impeachment proceedings.\n",

He has held first place almost continuously barring a brief peak by Ben Carson since midJuly.People often say that the Republican party is split into a minority albeit a large one who favour Trump and a majority who are waiting for another candidate to rally behind. But at this point its far too late for a new candidate to enter the race and even if he did of the Republican electorate is already gone.More importantly looking at this survey shows that Trump beats every single other candidate by a significant margin in a head to head. He beats Rubio the establishment favourite to and Ted Cruz the compromise candidate by the same margin.He has ridiculed women the disabled Mexicans and Muslims going so far as to suggest banning the latter from entering the country.\n",

Although admittedly it is far from a consensus many seem to believe that the hunting of these exotic animals is objectively wrong and therefore should be prohibited. It is likely that many of those vocal with their distaste of hunting for sport like the gt signatories of the Justice for Cecil petition however are also consumers of meat. I believe this can be inferred by the sheer amount of negative press Walter Palmer is receiving contrasted with the fact that a minority of people are vegetarians. This perspective seems hypocritical.\n",

The jedi is basically trying to rob the guy.Is there some way hes not being a huge jerk here?What would change my view an argument that Watto wouldnt have been getting ripped off if QuiGon had been successful argument that QuiGon had no choice but to rip Watto off hard to do since he ends up getting the part through other means also he didnt even check if he had any other options than mindcontrol to get what he wanted before attempting it. His default plan was to just mindcontrol the person to get what he wanted at the other guys expense. argument that Watto is worthy of getting ripped off best bet I mean he owns slaves I guess?

Once they realized I was off the table of sorts and was serious about my now boyfriend the relationship just dwindled despite my continuing to talk to them just as much as before.

Ultimately I have to conclude that while both Fascism and Communism are evil Communism is the more so.My takeaways from this discussion are.

Some Communist countries experienced times of relative peace or less killing which some believe make it superior to Fascism..\n",

Many of them also talk openly about how to enforce these attitudes in the population.For examples look at the environmental lobby which frequently complains that its worst problem is lack of compliance or governors of congested areas who introduce road charges in order to force people to behave in away which is more conducive to their agenda.Im not saying rightwing politics is not guilty of this too but at least it does talk more about personal liberties and freedoms of the individual rather than serving the state even if it often is just talk.I was just reading the clime change thread on this sub and what struck me was that a lot of people on there were berating the OP for his unwillingness to give up on his conveniences and standards of living one or two people spoke to him like a teacher to an obnoxious child. For examplesource...erm no he doesnt want to but the desires of people who dont follow the agenda are not relevant are they? Ill admit I chose this example because it resonated with me I like driving I dont want to give it up and I dont like being slowly forced to whether by public transport or self driving cars that eventually lose their manual option or just increasing expense.\n",
      "970 j Baseball is never short of ways to measure a players ability. Statistics and numbers are a core of the game. In the past few decades weve also gotten some pretty decent ways to measure performance that account for not just the player but also the environment around him. ERA does no such thing can be incredibly inaccurate and is arguably the most prominent stat used for pitchers.Stats that work very well are things like WHIP Walks and Hits per Innings Pitched. This still isnt perfect since a hit depends on your defense but then again theres very few any? perfect stats.\n",
      "971 j My old thought was that money made people happier only to a point but once people are living comfortable lives money doesnt matter much.Ive since become aware of some information that both explains why this looks right and also why its wrong.Graphs showing the relationship between money and happiness show sharp increases as people increase from poverty to comfortable living and then they show a drastic leveling off almost to flatness as they measure the differences between the comfortable the rich the very rich etc.But if you extend that graph far enough you find that it keeps going up little by little. If you compress the graph and look at it logarithmically see youll find that the relationship between money and happiness hold steady.In other words you have to keep doubling your money just to get the same increase in happiness. So theres a huge difference between yr and yr but to see an equally big difference you cant go up just another you have to go all the way to yr at which point youll see that these rich people are significantly happier than the yr people just as the rs people are happier than the yr people.\n",
      "972 j Clear liquors are designed to be mixed with other fluids. They either have no taste or an awful taste that would put off a dog eating its own shit. You absolutely have to mix these with juice or tonic something to take away from the disgusting flalvors. Brown liquors on the other hand have distinct flavors notes that even the untrained pallet can make out. Brown liquors have their taste taken away when you mix them.\n",
      "973 j I think that it is ok to teach other theories about life forming on Earth other than just evolution. In my opinion when we only teach evolution and shove it down peoples throats they might find some other thing such as Intelligent Design and believe that because they never heard of it anywhere else. When kids learn about creationism in schools they have the oppurtunity to debate it with their peers and discuss it with their teachers. If they learn it from their local religous proselitizer then they might believe whatever they say even if they have heard about evolution in class. Obviously it should be made clear that CreationismIntelligent Design has little or no basis in science and science strongly suggests that evolution is real.\n",
      "974 j Whenever I read something in perfect columns I always hate coming across a word broken up by a hyphen just for the sake of having the column of words look nice and be all even. Sometimes you can read the word easily because its made of components like because or always which isnt so bad. But sometimes the words are made of phonemes that your brain only comprehends when it sees all the letters together like trough or anachronistic or morphology. It gives me needless pause when reading a text and I just encountered a problem that put the nail in the coffin for me.I was reading a journal article on PDF and I was trying to CtrlF a word I distinctly remember reading but it wouldnt work. Was I mistaken about the word being in the text?\n",
      "975 j Because western written languages are read horizontally from lefttoright writing tends to be taught horizontally from lefttoright. This makes sense for a righthanded person because their writing hand never covers the written words. This is not the case for lefthanded folks.Lefties tend to have horrible penmanship and often have difficulty writing in notebooks especially small wirebound notebooks. Even on flat paper on a desk lefties tend to skooch there knuckles across the paper and smear ink or pencil.In an equivalent mirror image world lefties would read and write horizontally from righttoleft and make their characters backwards. Leonardo da Vinci use to write this way But this is generally not practical.My view is that lefthand children should be taught the same alphabet characters as righthanded children but they should be taught to write in a different style so that their hands never cover the written text.\n",
      "976 j This one is a tricky one amongst Democrats in my family. Is it better for Democrats to wait out Trumps first term without attempting to do the nearly impossible task of impeaching him essentially expecting Trump to turn the swing voters against him in all by himself or try to impeach him?I fall to the side of Rep. Brad Sherman and think that fighting for impeachment is a smarter bet for democrats. I think many voters will see waiting Trump out as putting politics before country. What do you think?\n",

      "979 j Ok so watch the world burn might be a little harsh. Its probably closer to simply hating the status quo so much that eliminating it is more important than anything else.As the candidates put out more and more details regarding their policy plans theres no doubt Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders have almost nothing in common besides their hair issues and a general support for Planned Parenthood. But on the big issues that could have serious impact on the lives of people living in the US immigration taxes foreign policy gun rights free speech health care higher education and the overall size and scope of the federal government they are close to polar opposites. Theres no way that a person who supports Bernie but who will vote for Trump is thinking you know Id like to have free health care and a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants but Ill settle for continuing with the current health care system and deporting all illegals. But last week The Guardian asked Bernie Sanders supporters who they would vote for if Hillary wins the nomination and of them said theyd seriously consider Trump while only said theyd vote Hillary.\n",
      "980 j I recently got in somewhat of an argument in real life and then was down voted after commenting on a reddit post both were based on noise complaints maybe Im missing something. I understand owning chickens I have a bakers dozen in my backyard now. Whether or not its feasible in an urban setting would depend on a case by case basis. But why have a rooster? The topics were both based on a neighbor having some hens and one rooster so Im pretty sure it isnt some cockfighting ring.\n",
      "981 j I see very little difference between killing a pig for its meat and killing a dog for fun. To change my view you will need to either convince me that there is a significant fundamental difference between the two or that its ok to kill dogs for fun. As someone who really enjoys eating meat I would really like for my view to be changed. I have spoken with a few people about this in the hopes that they would convince me that its ok to continue eating meat but so far the arguments have been entirely unconvincing.Id like to preemptively address some arguments that I do not find compelling.. People need to eat to survive therefore eating meat is morally acceptable.I do not find this answer compelling because we do not have to eat meat to survive.\n",

      "983 j Except Austin. My perception is that Texas is full of ignorant bible abusing homophobes that take leviticus more seriously than the general theme of love everybody. Texans would rather drive trucks running on coal power than save money with a hybrid. Texans tend to be racist and eat more meat than they should to a point where there are proportionately more fat people than the US average. Texans hate hispanic people and want to send them all away because they think these people do more harm than good Texans would often sooner teach the bible than evolution sports are more important than learning and knowledge to Texans Texans condemn porn almost as much as they watch it Texas is generally terribleI want not to hate it but I see very little reason not to.\n",
      "984 j This is largely in response to a new distracted driving law that went into effect yesterday in Washington state. My view is simple most of the law seems fine to me but there should be an exception for cars that are stationary at a red light. I do not believe that using your phone while motionless at a red light is unsafe. Therefore I believe that this portion of the law is excessive and could even lead to dangerous situations. When stopped at a red light the only thing really necessary is to keep your foot on the brake.\n",
      "985 j Over the last few months I find myself constantly debating with people that nuclear power should be the future. Most people seem to think that solar and wind for example are better solutions but I firmly believe in nuclear. The efficiency is there. The new tech for reactors like Flouride and Thorium Salt reactors have huge upsides fusion may not be that far away with increased funding as seen here The arguments against nuclear mostly cite disasters like Fukushima and Chernobyl. Though Nuclear seems to have a great safety record all things considered disasters is years or so.\n",

      "987 j For the sake of argument I am referring to GamerGate as the group as it is now and as it was months ago before it had a name and the movement lurked on chanWizardchanRedditI believe GamerGate is an online hate group. The rhetorical techniques and structure of the group reminds me strongly of other hate groups that have existed for decades before. I also recognize that GamerGate is in a huge state of change right now and a large number of their members deny or fight the hate group elements of it. I believe the contingent that are actively fighting against the hateful elements are too naive to recognize the process and therefore will not be able to control it. The majoritynot all of GamerGate are straight white males.\n",
      "988 j I think bicycle lanes on streets are the way to go. That said my state just doesnt have the infrastructure put in place yet. Cyclists riding in the street are forced to hold up traffic causing an undue burden on drivers. Cyclists cant ride as fast as cars. They slow traffic and create opportunity for danger when drivers have to pass on roads not meant for passing.\n",

      "990 j I see many Redditors saying how the relations between both superpowers would be a bad thing without providing good explanations besides what I describe as something similar to propaganda Putin is a dictator The country is corrupt He will manipulate Trump and the US for the good of RU etc.I think allying would be a great thing as having more allies is better than less as long as rules are followed. Sure Crimea was taken by RU and as a descendant from Ukrainian I disagree with that. There are bad things with RU but many countries have the same problem with different scenarios. Basically no country is perfect and countries follow their culture and the past.As seen in the space war we allied with RU and did wondrous things related to such. Our economy could strengthen RU and visa versa.We could tell RU not to do a certain thing and they might listen to us.\n",
      "991 j They are always portrayed as being right along side people that have actually done relevant things to contribute to society today. I think that both culturally and musically they were not that big of a deal. There are loads of better musicians and many more interesting people. After all they did start out as an equivalent to todays boy bands they were a figure head something for girls to oogle at. There are so many conspiracies about The Beatles and I dont think there have been the same amount of cover bands for any other band in history besides maybe The Dead but they were great musicians.\n",

      "993 j Leaving a tip feels so customary in certain places that its become an incentive to do your job properly. I understand that its the service that they provide and not just the food but isnt that exactly what theyre paid for? To give a paying customer a good service? Although I sympathize with their outrageously low wages but why should I have to fork out more of my money that Im already spending at a restaurant to subsidize young Jenny here to get her up to normal living wage? Isnt that a governmental issue of povertylow wages?\n",
      "994 j For almost the entire duration of the IsraelPalestine conflict Israel has been in a position of power. Theyve had stronger allies a better military and international support. Throughout most of the conflict theyve been willing to negotiate for Palestinian independence in exchange for longterm peace. By that Israel wants defensible borders i.e. Golan Heights and Jordan Valley as they recognize that the Middle East is inherently unstable.\n",
      "995 j In America debtors imprisonment was made illegal some time ago US courts decided that being sent to prison because one is unable to reimburse a loan to a private company is unlawful. Now a days Bail Bonds originate from the government as courts but pass though private companies that specialize on the repayment of those bonds. Even though there is no loan that needs to be paid off wouldnt holding someone in a cell for any amount of time because they cant pay off a bail be illegal under the logic of debtors imprisonment?\n",
      "996 j After the attacks against not just France but also Lebanon and Russia it is clear that ISIS is shifting strategies. Previously they focused on securing land and setting up a new caliphate. Foreign air power which has broken the momentum of their offensives has made this mission impossible. Given a few years these air strikes will inevitably push ISIS back and eventually cause its collapse. The last weeks of attacks show that ISIS is not only willing but able to carry out attacks on soft targets with the goal of killing large numbers of civilian.\n",
      "997 j I was only able to find one other thread about this topic and it was kind of a train wreck.Common arguments Its not Jraphics Interchange Format by that logic NASA would be pronounced Naysa and SCUBA would be pronounced Scuhbuh. Acronyms that are not initialisms are pronounced like they are words of their own which brings me to point Its pronounced like gift because thats the only other word with gif! by that logic due to the existence of the word girth giraffe would be pronounced with a hard g. Gift is the exception not the rule. See here To base the pronunciation of a word on an exception is highly illogical. The dictionary says both pronunciations are fine! The dictionary also says that literally means both literally and not literally.\n",
      "998 j I believe that prostitution should not be legalized. Whether I morally agree with prostitution or not is not what matters here. The laws in the United States are set in order to protect the freedom safety and quality of life of the citizens not willing to argue about this. Yes the US has Freedom of Choice Act for all. And many try to use this to argue that prostitution should be legalized.\n",
      "999 j People who say God has a plan for us all and things of this sort and who also believe that God has our best interests at heart should not complain about unfair circumstances or a negative event in their life. I think they are perfectly within their rights to grieve and feel bad.If someone believes that there is a set path that everyone follows in life that they can not change then whatever event occurs is undoubtedly a part of this predetermined fate. Whatever happens is all part of gods plan and that plan is for the greatest good. It would be incredibly selfish to feel that their feelings and comfort are more important than what god has planned. When something detrimental happens in life they should look at it as a challenge to overcome instead of as god punishing them or being given an unfair hand.\n"
