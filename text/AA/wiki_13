Species of particular interest are the brant, tundra swan, mute swan, mallard, and snow goose.\nVDGIF staff are in the field checking popular hunting spots, waterway boat ramps, and wildlife management areas where returning hunters may be asked to allow them to perform a swab test on bagged birds. The VDGIF press release says the procedure only takes seconds to perform, and those who bagged 3 birds of the targeted species can call the department to have someone come check the birds.\nAvian Flu first surfaced in Asia in 2003. It is uncertain what factors contribute to the spread of the disease, but newer strains of H5N1 are more communicable than earlier recognized strains. \"Although the spread of H5N1 in Asia has been primarily due to movement of domestic birds, the movement of this virus into wild birds raised the possibility that these species may also spread the virus,\" the U.S.Department of the Interior found in its March 2006 interagency strategic plan for early detection of the disease. It was found that Avian flu moved into wild birds and caused mortality among species of barheaded geese, brown-headed gulls, black-headed gulls, ruddy shelducks, and great cormorants in China in 2005.\nThe migratory flyways considered most at risk of disease transmission are on the Pacific side of the Americas in Alaska and the Pacific NorthWest, closest to Asia. The Atlantic flyway shares migratory influence from Europe and Africa where the Avian Flu has also been found.\nA low pathogenic strain of H5N1 that currently exists in North America is common among waterfowl. Testing for the more virulent strains involves swabbing the bird's throat or rectum. "}

Dr Brash had announced last week today that he was stepping down from leader of the National Party.\nDr. Brash was to stay on in politics as long as the new leader, John Key, gave him a senior portfolio and front bench position, where it was thought there would be no room for Dr Brash. However Dr Brash did not comment on whether he had sought that kind of position. The front bench positions and a possible portfolio reorganising will not be announced until tomorrow, Friday.\nOver the past few days Dr Brash had been pondering his political career and he said that it is clear that he should leave politics after consulting with friends, colleagues and family including his wife, Je Lan. Dr Brash said: \"I've come to the conclusion that now is the right time for me to leave Parliament and I informed John Key of that earlier today.\"\nAt the press conference where he announced his intention to leave, few journalists were there compared to his resignation from leader conference.\nDr Brash will stay in Parliament until next year when he will not return. He said that he wanted to tie up loose knots.\nMr Key, last Thursday, said that he had only a few talks with Dr Brash, one on Tuesday and one this morning, but would not comment on Brash's future. Dr Brash described those meetings as \"constructive.\"\nWhen Dr Brash first entered politics in 2002 from being head of the Reserve Bank, he had wanted to make a difference and he said that he leaves with the belief that he had accomplished that. He also believes that National could take out the next election to be held in 2008 as it is in great shape. Dr Brash said: \"I entered Parliament in 2002 with the intention of making a difference and I leave believing that I've done that. The National Party is in great shape to win the next election and I believe that debate about economic policy and about the Treaty is more mature and more realistic than it was five years ago.\"\nDr Brash still claims that the book based around his leaked political emails by Nicky Hager, titled \"The Hollow Men: A Study in the Politics of Deception\", played no part in his decision to leave.\nNext year Katrina Shanks, accountant, will enter politics again to fill in the empty seat made by Dr Brash, she is currently at number 46 on the list. She had been in politics last year but was forced out after the special votes were counted. Ms Shanks said that she feels positive about changing her career but she said that she would have preferred entering politics on election night and not because Dr Brash had left.\nDr Brash announced that he will look into becoming a director at a company but would not be a director at a state owned enterprise, \"not with this Government.\" He told TV3's Campbell Live programme that he will now look after his kiwifruit orchard.\nDr Brash said his colleagues reaction was mixed, Dr Brash said some said: \"you've done a fantastic job for the National Party. Your work on that has finished.\""}

The AHLC is representing Jerry Rabinowitz and the action is against Arthur Anderson in his capacity as supervisor of elections for Palm Beach County. But the organization indicates that more lawsuits in other states are expected to follow\u2014all being part of an effort to show that churches are improper polling places because they cannot be religiously and politically neutral and because their use is subject to widespread abuse. \n\u201cChurches are currently the most common polling location in America\u201d according to James Hurley, the lead attorney handling the case. Speaking at yesterday\u2019s press conference, Hurley noted that while some churches cover or remove religious symbols in those parts of their facilities used as polling places, not all do so, nor is the practice required everywhere. \u201cWhen asked, the Palm Beach County Supervisor of Elections Office said there was no rule requiring removal of such religious icons,\u201d Hurley added. \nRabinowitz\u2019s complaint is that, because he was assigned to vote at Emmanuel Catholic Church in Delray Beach, Florida, he found it necessary when entering the polling place to \u201cwalk past a church-sponsored \u2018pro-life\u2019 banner framed by multiple giant crosses before even entering the church\u201d to vote. This caused him to be \u201cextremely upset\u201d regarding the religious setting of the polls. According to Hurley, \u201cRabinowitz observed many religious symbols in plain view\u201d in the voting area. They were \u201csurrounding the election judges and in direct line above the voting machines. These objects included a sign declaring that \u2018Each of Us Matters to God,\u2019 multiple crucifixes, a sign that says \u2018God, I Make a Difference,\u2019 a large copy of the Lord\u2019s Prayer and a Hail Mary, and a large poster of the Ten Commandments.\u201d When Rabinowitz objected and \u201casked election officials to remove or cover them for the remainder of the voting\u201d officials allegedly refused to do so. \n\u201cThis is clearly a violation of the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution,\u201d Hurley concluded, because it \u201chas the primary effect of advancing religion.\u201d \nAlso speaking at the press conference were the president and executive director of the American Humanist Association, the organization behind the new legal center, and Heidi Bruggink, the center\u2019s legal coordinator. Speaking of the AHLC in general, Bruggink reported, \u201cOur attorney roster includes many accomplished and prominent nontheistic attorneys, including Jim McCollum, Wendy Kaminer, and Michael Newdow.\u201d These three are the most famous members of a legal team that \u201cnow consists of twenty-seven committed lawyers supported by several law students\u201d and others. \nThe litigation challenging churches as polling places is a result of volunteer action nationwide by members of the American Humanist Association. \u201cWe put out a call to our members whose polling places were churches, asking them to report what they saw,\u201d said the organization\u2019s president, Mel Lipman. And this is what led to the Florida case and others that are expected to follow. "}

The decision is being hailed by conservation groups who claim the sharks would become extinct if hunting continued.\nIt will be illegal for a great white sharks, also known by the less common name white pointer sharks, to be hunted, possessed, killed or traded within 200 nautical miles of New Zealand according to The Wildlife Act. However if the shark was accidentally caught or killed then no prosecution will occur if they register the incident with authorities. And swimmers in Dunedin, New Zealand will also be protected by the use of shark nets.\nThe decision mainly comes because New Zealand signed the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals.\nMr Carter said: \"These majestic animals occur naturally in low numbers and, without protection, could be pushed to the brink of extinction. The Wildlife Act provides a strong deterrent against targeting great whites with a $250,000 fine and up to six months imprisonment as a maximum penalty.\" \nKirstie Knowles, spokeswoman for Forest and Bird, said: \"The sharks had been landed with an undeserved bad rap.\"\nVaughan Hill wants Mr Carter to reconsider as he is the latest man in New Zealand who has survived a shark attack. Mr Hill wants the reconsideration because of fear of his children being attacked and not because he was once attacked. Mr Hill now only 35% control of one arm with the other been amputated and has scars on his back and front. Mr Hill was 23-years-old when the attack occurred 10 years ago while he was diving for p\u0101ua, or Abalone, commercially 100 meters away from Pitt Island, \"It was pretty murky water and I felt a big smack ... I was looking into the eye and the jaw of the shark.\"\n\"The last thing I thought was that I had to get another mouthful of air to fight it off, but blood overtook me.\"\nMr Hill said that sharks should only be protected if they are in a \"ring-fenced marine reserve.\" He desribed the great white shark as \"the ultimate killing machines [which] should be controlled. I want the beaches protected, and the workplace, which for divers is the sea.\"\nDr Malcolm Francis, principal scientist of NIWA (National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research), said: \"Despite the sharks' fierce reputation they were mysterious to biologists. Great whites were known to travel huge distances but their breeding and life cycles were not as well documented.\"\n\"They are incredible predators, but they are more vulnerable than us,\" Dr Francis said, \"Human attacks are more likely a case of mistaken identity. They let go when they realise we're not their normal prey (fish and seals), but often the initial bite is devastating.\"\nJim Anderton, minister of fisheries, said: \"The white pointer shark was not known to be targeted by commercial fishing but was occasionally taken, unintentionally, as by-catch. They were sometimes targeted by recreational fishers and there was some demand for jaws and teeth as fishing trophies. Others were unintentionally caught in set nets.\"\n\"No one wants to see an animal hunted to extinction for the sake of a jaw or a few teeth or to be placed under pressure by accidental catch. Under these new regulations no fisher will be able to profit from taking a white pointer, and any fisher inadvertently catching one will have to return it to the sea, intact, and alive, if possible.\"\nIn New Zealand there have only been nine reported cases of shark attacks for 16-years."}

This is the first step in the long expected military coup.\nFiji's president dissolved parliament on Tuesday and sanctioned the military to remove embattled Prime Minister Laisenia Qarase, said New Zealand Prime Minister Helen Clark\nQarase, who is in his residence in Suva, said the military was staging a coup and he would not resign but would have to be forcibly removed from office.\n\"I am not going anywhere,\" Qarase told Reuters.\n\"I am the democratically elected prime minister of the people of Fiji. They will have to move me by force.\"\n\"I have been advised this morning that the president of Fiji has acted outside his constitutional powers and supported the removal of the democratic prime minister by the military,\" Clark said in a statement to the New Zealand parliament.\nActing Police Commissioner Moses Driver denied that any take over had occurred. He said soldiers arrived to inspect police weapons, and were waiting for approval for that inspection. Troops later surrounding the Nasova Police Academy in Suva demanding the handover of weapons, and occupied the main police station in Suva. No shots were fired when the police were locked out.\nAt a news conference inside the main Suva barracks, Commander Frank Bainimarama said that police weapons were confiscated so that \"dissidents\" did not use them against the military.\nThere are also reports that military checkpoints are been set up around the capital. There are approximately four roadblocks with 20 soliders at each.\nTroops tried to arrest the Prime Minister of Fiji, Laisenia Qarase, in the afternoon by setting up a roadblock between Suva and the province where Mr Qarase was attending a meeting, but he escaped in a helicopter, and has since been in hiding. The Prime Minister and his cabinet are understood to be in safe, secure places, and some of them separated for extra security. \nThe army kept up the pressure on Mr Qarase when he was later summoned to President Ratu Josefa Iloilo's residence.\nMr Qarase drove to the estate, but was told by soldiers at a roadblock outside that he would have to walk the rest of the way. A witness inside the grounds said the prime minister, whose bodyguards were also disarmed by the military, refused and returned to his office.\nMr Qarase will make another attempt to meet President Iloilo on Tuesday morning.\nMilitary chief Commander Frank Bainimarama had repeatedly threatened to remove Prime Minister Laisenia Qarase's government unless it drops several pieces of legislation, including a bill that would grant amnesty to those involved in a coup in 2000. Commander Bainimarama has laid allegations on PM Qarase of stalling his pledge of ditching of the controversial legislation. \nHowever Bainimarama is denying a coup is under way. \"This is not a coup,\" Bainimarama said today. \"Everything is normal. Nothing is going on.\" \nHe had earlier imposed a deadline of noon (0000GMT) on Friday, December 1 but that deadline was extended to today as there was the annual rugby game between the police and the military. Commander Bainimarama is both an avid rugby fan and active church goer. The police won the rugby game. \"I maintain my demands and the deadline still stands and I will make a commitment to my stand after the rugby match,\" he said.\nMr Qarase told Fiji radio on Monday morning that he remained in control and has called an emergency cabinet meeting for Tuesday.\nFiji's Great Council of Chiefs called for calm on Monday and for the military to return to negotiations with the government.\nLocal radio reported seven government vehicles used by ministers and parliament's Speaker had been confiscated by the military since Monday night.\nWorld leaders have commended Commander Bainimarama actions. Including New Zealand which has banned Commander Bainimarama from entering New Zealand except if he is attending political crises talks. Helen Clark described the situation as \"...it's a very disturbing situation.\" Some of Commander Bainimarama's close family live in New Zealand.\nConditions on the street of Fiji are said to be mixed, with some apprehension.\nThe United Nations might discontinue use of Fijian soldiers in peacekeeping operations of which is a large source of Fiji's income. Also the British army might not use Fijian soldiers. The International Community have said they will discontinue aid to Fiji which is worth millions annually. \nPast Fijian coups.\nFiji has suffered three coups since 1987. \nOn the morning of May 14, 1987, 10 masked, armed soldiers entered the House of Representatives.\nColonel Sitiveni Rabuka, dressed in civilian clothes and motivated by claims of racial discrimination against ethnic Fijians, approached Prime Minister Timoci Bavadra from the public gallery and ordered MPs to leave.\nThe bloodless coup was a success but subsequent talks proposed a government of national unity under the leadership of the governor-general, involving both the deposed government and the indigenous-supported Alliance Party.\nFearing the gains of the first coup would be lost, Mr Rabuka staged a second coup on September 25 that year.\nThis time he severed ties with the British monarchy, who held the title Queen of Fiji (Ilisapeci-Na Radi ni Viti kei Peritania, or interpreted Elizabeth- Queen of Fiji and Great Britain) and proclaimed a republic.\nA new constitution ratified in 1990 guaranteed indigenous Fijians the offices of President and Prime Minister, along with two-thirds of the Senate and a substantial majority of the House of Representatives.\nBut these provisions were overturned by a constitutional review in 1997.\nHardline Fijian nationalists led by bankrupt businessman George Speight led a further coup in May, 2000, when they overthrew the nation's first Indo-Fijian prime minister Mahendra Chaudry, holding him hostage inside parliament for eight weeks along with most of his cabinet and many MPs and their staff.\nMr Speight declared himself Prime Minister, and ordered the President, Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara to step aside as president. Mr Mara refused to negotiate with the plotters, and decided instead to dismiss the kidnapped government and assume emergency powers himself. His move backfired, however. In what politicians called \"a coup within a coup,\" Ratu Mara was whisked away on the naval ship Kiro on 28 May, where he was allegedly approached by a group of present and former military and police officers and ordered to suspend the Constitution. When he refused, (\"If the Constitution goes, I go,\" he defiantly declared) the group, are alleged to have asked for, and possibly forced, Mara's resignation. \nFrank Bainimarama then declared martial law, abrogated the constitution and set up an interim government.\nCommander Bainimarama was almost killed in a failed, bloody mutiny linked to the 2000 coup on the 2 November that year, when rebel soldiers mutinied at Suva's Queen Elizabeth Barracks. The mutiny resulted in the death of four loyal soldiers, and blames Mr Qarase for being soft on those behind it.\nHe appointed Laisenia Qarase as prime minister before handing power to an interim administration headed by Ratu Josefa Iloilo as President.\nMr Speight was arrested on July 27 along with 369 supporters.\nThe government reneged on an agreement granting Speight immunity from prosecution, Commander Bainimarama saying the military had signed it \"under duress\".\nMr Speight remains in prison on an island off Suva."}

Allende's rule had seen a growing polarization of Chilean society, economic crisis, and terrorist activity from far-left groups. Pinochet set about exterminating his opposition, mainly socalists and communists, and suspended the constiution. His neoliberal economic policies, carried out by the \"Chicago Boys\", a group of Chilean economists influenced by Milton Friedman, were able to reduce the rampant hyperinflation and stabilize the economy. In 1981, a plebiscite approved a new constitution drafted by Pinochet's government. As the new constitution decreed, another plebiscite took place in 1988 to determine whether Pinochet should remain in power. The \"No\" option won and Pinochet stepped down. He remained as head of the army and senator until 1998, when he relinquished these positions. He was arrested that year in London for human rights violations, but was able to return to Chile. He is currently under investigation by Chilean officials over tax evasion and human rights violatons.

In one of the worst hit provinces, Albay, two villages were buried by volcanic mudslides and volunteers were working to recover bodies from the wreckage.\nAccording to the Red Cross, rescue boats were used to survey the damage and take people to the 305 evacuation centers. The Red Cross estimated about 66,616 people were now homeless based upon the number of homes destroyed in the wake of Durian.\nEarlier, the National Disaster Coordinating Council said 38,473 displaced people were in evacuation shelters.\nOften hit by storms.\nThe Philippines' location in the northwestern Pacific puts it right in the pathway of the world's top typhoon generator, according to meteorologists. Durian is the fourth devastating typhoon to strike the Philippines in the past four months, covering the Mayon volcano with so much wind and rain that ash and boulders cascaded down its slopes in walls of black mud that swamped entire villages Thursday.\nHemmed in by geography and poverty, the Philippines has tried to minimize the damage caused by the 20 or so typhoons that hit the sprawling archipelago every year. Nationwide in 2001-05, 2,892 people were killed and 909 others went missing in typhoons and other storms, which caused damage totaling US$521 million, says the National Disaster Coordinating Council.\nAnthony Golez, the council's deputy chief, notes that the estimate doesn't include losses to employment and other economic opportunities, and that Filipinos should be \"bombarded\" with disaster information, including stories of the Indian Ocean tsunami two years ago and the February 2006 landslide in the central Philippine village of Guinsaugon that killed more than 1,000.\nSenator Richard Gordon, who heads the Philippine National Red Cross, said better planning is needed. \"The big problem here in our country is we don't plan our communities. It's every man for himself.\""}

A brief announcement by the hospital said Pinochet's condition had worsened suddenly following a heart attack on December 3. Earlier in the week he was reported to be recovering from the heart failure. \nIn 1973 Augusto Pinochet took power in a US-assisted coup against Chile's democratically elected president, Salvador Allende Gossens, who died in the first hours of the military takeover. His rule of terror, which he maintained by silencing all opposition, lasted 17 years and produced a national trauma that has still not fully healed.\nA few hours after the dictator's death, the Chilean government spokesman, Ricardo Lagos Weber, announced there would be no state funeral or national mourning. But the government authorized the flying of flags at half-mast on military buildings, and Pinochet's funeral will be performed with military honors. Chile's president, Michelle Bachelet, will not attend.\nWithin hours of the news yesterday, thousands of people gathered at Plaza Italia to celebrate the ex-dictator's death. There was a jubilant carnival atmosphere in the streets as people merrily waved flags, sang songs or drank champagne. Later on, there were reports of clashes with police firing water cannon and tear gas at the crowd. \nA smaller group of right-wingers mourned Pinochet's passing outside the Military Hospital, clutching pictures of the dead dictator. \"It is very sad, because it is as if we were left orphans,\" one Pinochet supporter told the press.\nBut many of Pinochet's opponents are angry because of his impunity during his lifetime. \"What saddens me is that this criminal has died without having been sentenced\", said Hugo Gutierrez, a human rights lawyer.\nDuring Pinochet's dictatorship, established in 1973 by means of a coup de \u00e9tat, and later maintained through the use of police and military forces, curfews and state terrorism, thousands were killed or disappeared, and in later years his image was further marred by reports that he had stolen large amounts of money held in foreign bank accounts and that he had been engaged in cocaine smuggling.\nAccused of dozens of human rights abuses, the ex-dictator was never tried for these crimes on the pretext of his frail health, despite repeated international attempts to take him to court.\nThere are a number of ceremonies to be held at Santiago, Chile, on December 12th. And there have been a number of clashes between the \"momios\" (right-wing pro-dictator sectors of the nation) and anti-pinochet manifestants, however, violence has not escalated to a concerning degree"}

It shows Labor is obsessed about leadership rather than policy and strategy,\" Mr Pyne said. \nIn a poll released by Newspoll today, a Rudd-Gillard leadership team had 48 percent support of the public, compared to the outgoing Beazley-Macklin team's 27 percent."}

The speech is called : \"Statement: Trident - The Future of the UK Nuclear Deterrent.\"\nThe Trident defence system was developed as Britain\u2019s response to the Cold War which ended with the collapse of the USSR in December 1991. The first Trident submarine went on patrol in December 1994. \nThe present system consists of Trident ballistic missiles with nuclear warheads carried by four Vanguard class nuclear powered submarines. The main issue is about the replacement of the submarine fleet.\nThere is to be debate about the proposals. Supporters who include the majority of the main opposition party, argue that because of the proliferation of nuclear weapons and threats from countries such as Iran and North Korea, Britain must have a nuclear defence capability. Opponents including at least one Cabinet Minister and several Labour back benchers, say that the system is an inappropriate response to the present threats to national security, terrorism, energy shortage and climate change and that there are better ways of spending the money. The Liberals advocate delay in making the decision. Fifteen Anglican bishops have denounced the possession of such a weapon as \u2018evil\u2019.\nAlex Salmond, leader of the Scottish National Party (SNP), said that although Scotland had no power to stop the replacment of the Trident weapons system, it had a host of powers to protect the environment. He promised that if the UK government went ahead with the Trident project, the SNP would propose to use those powers to stop it proceeding in Scotland. There are two establishments in Scotland, at Faslane and Rosyth, providing services to the nuclear submarine fleet. "}

After losing a couple of early wickets, they recovered to amass 6-551 dec. spanning the opening two days. Paul Collingwood scored a patient 206, whilst teammate Kevin Pietersen built an innings of 158 in a much more brief fashion.\nIn response, Australia began their first innings poorly, losing Matthew Hayden before the close of play on day 2. On the morning of day 3, Justin Langer and Damien Martyn also fell cheaply. However, a captain's effort by Ricky Ponting (142) and support by Michael Clarke (124), as well as cameos by Adam Gilchrist and Shane Warne, helped the Aussies to just shy of England's massive total. Matthew Hoggard was the shining light for the visitors, taking 7-109.\nEngland resumed the fifth day at 1-59, and the match looked headed for a draw. However, with some magic from Shane Warne, Australia managed to roll England for just 129 in the last over before tea, setting up a thrilling final session run chase. Warne took 4-49, and was backed up well by Glenn McGrath, who took 2-15.\nRequiring 168 to win off 35 overs, Australia came out firing, scoring quickly before losing both Hayden and Justin Langer early. Ricky Ponting was joined by Michael Hussey, who was promoted to number four, and built a steady partnership before Ponting was dismissed for 49. Damien Martyn then fell cheaply, and Hussey was joined by Michael Clarke to complete the chase. The pair batted through to the total was reached, with Hussey scoring 61 not out. Australia reached the target with 19 balls to spare, at 6:45pm local time.\nNo team had lost after declaring on as high a total batting first as England did in more than 125 years of Tests. As a Nine Network commentator described it, \"Australia has just won the most extraordinary Test match; however, it was [a Test] that England should never have lost\". Prior to the start of play, bookmakers had a draw paying $1.02.\nAustralia now go into the third test at the WACA ground in Perth, Western Australia knowing one more win will reclaim the Ashes urn which they lost for the first time in over a decade in England during 2005."}

Initial infrastructure would be brought to the Moon from Earth; as work progressed, the settlement would provide hydrogen and oxygen mined from the lunar surface to make water and rocket fuel.\nWhile NASA plans to use American astronauts in the construction and maintenance of the base, plans are underway for a multinational effort. Canada has been asked to provide astronauts for assistance, and NASA has since entered talks with the European Space Agency, Australia, China, France, Germany, England, India, Italy, Russia, South Korea, and Ukraine to see how those nations and space agencies may be able to contribute to costs, logistics and other efforts. NASA did not release figures on how much the settlement will cost to build and maintain, but have been searching for both public and private funding from around the globe. \nNASA says that the base will serve as part of a mission to learn about the Moon and places beyond. It is also seen as part of a long-range plan to send astronauts to Mars.\nThis will be the first manned mission to the moon since 1972. "}

They also launched the online Apple Store New Zealand which provides Apple products, such as iPods, Mac minis, etc. New Zealand is number 22 on the number of countries who have the iTunes store and the tenth music download store in New Zealand.\nThe launch means that New Zealanders can now download music to transfer to their iPods, legally. However the music is only available to iPod's as converting the music to the MP3 standard for other MP3 players is illegal in New Zealand. Some music download sites in New Zealand support MP3 formats, like Digirama which sell their music tracks for $1.75.\nThe New Zealand iTunes store provides the most digital music tracks in New Zealand at around two million and each song costs NZ$1.79 or a music video costs $3.59 of which there around thousands, an album will usually cost about $17.99 and a game will cost $7.99. The music tracks also include New Zealand artists such as Brooke Fraser, Tim Finn, Fat Freddy's Drop, etc and also includes international exclusive albums such as Red Hot Chili Peppers, Ben Harper, etc.\nEddy Cue, vice president of Apple, said: \"We're thrilled to bring the iTunes Store and the online Apple Store to our customers in New Zealand just in time for the holidays.\"\nThere were rumours surrounding the launch of a New Zealand iTunes store this week.\nThe podcast section on iTunes also covers a wide range of podcasts, equalling over 65,000. The New Zealand podcasts include such companies as TVNZ (Television New Zealand), Radio New Zealand and The Voice Booth.\nIt is commonly believed that the reason the store was halted until now was because Apple has to make separate contracts with each recording company in each country.\niTunes is likely to become the dominant music download store in New Zealand, following the trend of other countries.\nThe special edition iPod nano has also been released in New Zealand. The special edition is red in colour instead of the normal white and black colours. The special iPod is available only on the online store at the same price as the normal iPod nanos but some of the profit goes to help fight HIV/AIDS in Africa.\nRenaissance is New Zealand's distributor of Apple goods and will still keep its contract despite Renaissance not being directly involved in both of the new online stores.

The suggestion follows an investigation into harmonising the countries' legal systems.\nThe two countries are separated by 1900 km (1200 miles) of sea. Australia has a population of 20 million, while New Zealand has a population of 4 million.\nPrior to 1901, New Zealand was considered one of the seven British colonies of Australasia, six of which united to form Australia in 1901.\nThe committee, which had representatives from both sides of Australian politics found that there were close ties between the two countries. People are free to move between the two countries without visas and there is a high-degree of co-operation between governments. The committee's report said \"While New Zealand ultimately chose not to join the federation, it is still included in the definition of the states in the Australian constitution.\n\"This historical context forms a backdrop to the closeness and breadth of the relationship between Australia and New Zealand today.\n\"While Australia and New Zealand are, of course, two sovereign nations, it seems to the committee that the strong ties between the two countries - the economic, cultural, migration, defence, governmental, and people to people linkages - suggest that an even closer relationship, including the possibility of union, is both desirable and realistic.\"\nChairman of the committee, Peter Slipper said Australia now wished for another committee to be established to look at integration between the two nations in the future. Such a committee would be poised to look at monetary and national union.\nThe committee acknowledged that despite legal harmonisation being relatively easy, the merger of the two countries could be difficult. \"The committee is also mindful that the harmonisation of laws is very much the art of the possible. Thus the merger of Australia and New Zealand or the progression to a unitary system of government in Australia, however desirable, might not be easy to achieve,\" the committee's report said.\nThe suggestion has received a cold reception in New Zealand. New Zealand's citizens have regularly rejected suggestions that their country be part of Australia, a sentiment echoed by Prime Minister Helen Clark. Mrs Clark said she had no intention of placing the proposal on the government's agenda.\n\"It won't be on our agenda 105 years later\", she said.\nNew Zealand's Foreign Minister, Winston Peters dismissed the proposal calling it a case of \"parliamentary adventurism\". He said despite the two countries close relationship, the two countries were too geographically separated. \"New Zealand is 1200 miles (1900 km) away from Australia and that's 1200 reasons why I don't go along with that committee, nor will New Zealanders,\" Mr Peters said."}

This was not a \u201cfruit salad\" from which one could pick and choose. Despite this, President Bush is giving indications that he is going to do just that. While agreeing that the Report had some good points to make, he said that he had also asked the Pentagon, the State Department and other government agencies to reflect on the Iraq situation and report their conclusions to him. \nThe report proposes progressive changes to the role of the troops deployed in Iraq, from combat to the training of Iraqi forces and the withdrawal of all combat troops by early 2008, depending on local conditions. The President made it clear that matters concerning the deployment of troops were for the military to determine. A change of strategy is expected to be announced within the next few weeks. \nBush has said that he will not talk with Syria or Iran unless they meet certain conditions. Syria would have to \"stop destabilizing\" the government of the Lebanon. Iran must \u201cverifiably suspend their nuclear enrichment program.\" In declaring these conditions, Bush and Tony Blair, prime movers in the invasion of Iraq, are in agreement. \nTony Blair reflected that the report\u2019s recommendations that settling the Arab/Israeli disputes in the area should be given priority. He has said that the key to solving the problems in Iraq, Lebanon, and elsewhere lay in settling the two-state disputes in Palestine. He announced that he would be visiting the region shortly. He would bring his experience in Northern Ireland to bear on the problem, indicating that persistence was needed to achieve reconciliation. President Bush said he supported this initiative.\nMeanwhile, Israel\u2019s Prime Minister, Ehud Olmert, flatly rejected the notion that there was any connection between the problems in Palestine and the situation in Iraq. He stated that the time may not be right for Israel to be negotiating with Syria and he reiterated Israel\u2019s absolute opposition to Iran\u2019s development of nuclear weapons. Robert Gates, the new candidate US Secretary of Defense, asserted that Iran is surrounded by nuclear powers, including Israel. Shimon Peres, Israel\u2019s deputy prime minister, refused to affirm or deny whether Israel had a nuclear weapons capability, saying that such uncertainty was a defense in itself."}

In the report it was stated that Anderson had \"solved a very important problem\" that was 1200 years old, the problem of division by zero. According to the BBC, Anderson had created a new number, that he had named \"nullity\", that lay outside of the real number line. Anderson terms this number a \"transreal number\", and denotes it with the Greek letter formula_1. He had taught this number to pupils at Highdown School, in Emmer Green, Reading. \nDr James A.D.W. Anderson is a member of the British Computer Society and a teacher in the Computer Science department (School of Systems Engineering) at the University of Reading. He was\na psychology graduate who worked in the Electrical and Electronic Engineering departments at the University of Sussex and Plymouth Polytechnic (now the University of Plymouth). His doctorate is from the University of Reading for (in Anderson's words) \"developing a canonical description of the perspective transformations in whole numbered dimensions\".\nReactions.\nThe BBC report provoked many reactions from mathematicians and others.\nIn reaction to the story, Mark C. Chu-Carroll, a computer scientist and researcher, posted a web log entry describing Anderson as an \"idiot math teacher\", and describing the BBC's story as \"absolutely infuriating\" and a story that \"does an excellent job of demonstrating what total innumerate idiots reporters are\". Chu-Carroll stated that there was, in fact, no actual problem to be solved in the first place. \"There is no number that meaningfully expresses the concept of what it means to divide by zero.\", he wrote, stating that all that Anderson had done was \"assign a name to the concept of 'not a number'\", something which was \"not new\" in that the IEEE floating-point standard, which describes how computers represent floating-point numbers, had included a concept of \"not a number\", termed \"NaN\", since 1985. Chu-Carroll further continued:\nThere have been a wide range of other reactions from other people to the BBC news story. Comments range from the humorous and the ironic, such as the B1FF-style observation that \"DIVIDION BY ZERO IS IMPOSSIBLE BECAUSE MY CALCULATOR SAYS SO AND IT IS THE TRUTH\" and the Chuck Norris Fact that \"Only Chuck Norris can divide by zero.\" (to which another reader replied \"Chuck Norris just \"looks\" at zero, and it divides itself.\"); through vigourous defences of Dr Anderson, with several people quoting the lyrics to Ira Gershwin's song \"They All Laughed (At Christopher Columbus)\"; to detailed mathematical discussions of Anderson's proposed axioms of transfinite numbers.\nThe reputation of the University of Reading.\nSeveral readers have commented that they consider this to have damaged the reputation of the Computer Science department, and even the reputation of the University of Reading as a whole. \"By publishing his childish nonsense the BBC actively harms the reputation of Reading University.\" wrote one reader. \"Looking forward to seeing Reading University maths application plummit.\" wrote another. \"Ignore all research papers from the University of Reading.\" wrote a third. \"I'm not sure why you refer to Reading as a 'university'. This is a place the BBC reports as closing down its physics department because it's too hard. Lecturers at Reading should stick to folk dancing and knitting, leaving academic subjects to grown ups.\" wrote a fourth. Steve Kramarsky lamented that Dr Anderson is not from the \"University of 'Rithmetic\".\nBBC journalism.\nThe proof that Anderson presented to the BBC, which BBC journalist Ollie Williams presented as Anderson's proof that one can divide by zero (\"written [...] on the back of an envelope for added authenticity\"), is the following:\nIn fact, this does not prove that one can divide by zero. Read from the top it is a syllogism that proves that, in Anderson's system of transreal numbers, since formula_5 (an axiom in Anderson's system) and formula_6 (a theorem in Anderson's system that Anderson proves as a lemma), therefore formula_7 (in Anderson's system). This is not a proof that one can divide by zero. That is assumed axiomatically right at the start. It is a proof that if one can divide by zero to yield a single defined value, then zero raised to the zeroth power will have the same value. \nSeveral readers criticised the journalists at the BBC who ran the story for not apparently contacting any mathematicians about Dr Anderson's idea. \"Journalists are meant to check facts, not just accept whatever they are told by a self-interested third party and publish it without question.\" wrote one reader on the BBC's web site. However, on Slashdot another reader countered \"The report is from Berkshire local news. Berkshire! Do you really expect a local news team to have a maths specialist? Finding a newsworthy story in Berkshire probably isn't that easy, so local journalists have to cover any piece of fluff that comes up. Your attitude to the journalist should be sympathy, not scorn.\"\nBen Goldacre, author of the \"Bad Science\" column in \"The Guardian\", wrote on his web log that \"what is odd is a reporter, editor, producer, newsroom, team, cameraman, soundman, TV channel, web editor, web copy writer, and so on, all thinking it\u2019s a good idea to cover a brilliant new scientific breakthrough whilst clearly knowing nothing about the context. Maths isn\u2019t that hard, you could even make a call to a mathematician about it.\", continuing that \"it\u2019s all very well for the BBC to think they\u2019re being balanced and clever getting Dr Anderson back in to answer queries about his theory on Tuesday, but that rather skips the issue, and shines the spotlight quite unfairly on him (he looks like a very alright bloke to me).\". \nFrom reading comments on his own web log as well as elsewhere, Goldacre concluded that he thought that \"a lot of people might feel it\u2019s reporter Ben Moore, and the rest of his doubtless extensive team, the people who drove the story, who we\u2019d want to see answering the questions from the mathematicians.\".\nAndrej Bauer, a professional mathematician from Slovenia writing on the \"Bad Science\" web log, stated that \"whoever reported on this failed to call a university professor to check whether it was really new. Any university professor would have told this reporter that there are many ways of dealing with division by zero, and that Mr. Anderson\u2019s was just one of known ones.\"\nOllie Williams, one of the BBC Radio Berkshire reporters who wrote the BBC story, initially stated that \"It seems odd to me that his theory would get as far as television if it's so easily blown out of the water by visitors to our site, so there must be something more to it.\" and directly responded to criticisms of BBC journalism on several points on his web log.\nHe pointed out that people should remember that his target audience was local people in Berkshire with no mathematical knowledge, and that he was \"not writing for a global audience of mathematicians\". \"Some people have had a go at Dr Anderson for using simplified terminology too,\" he continued, \"but he knows we're playing to a mainstream audience, and at the time we filmed him, he was showing his theory to a class of schoolchildren. Those circumstances were never going to breed an in-depth half-hour scientific discussion, and none of our regular readers would want that.\".\nOn the matter of fact checking, he replied that \"if you only want us to report scientific news once it's appeared, peer-reviewed, in a recognised journal, it's going to be very dry, and it probably won't be news.\", adding that \"It's not for the BBC to become a journal of mathematics \u2014 that's the job of journals of mathematics. It's for the BBC to provide lively science reporting that engages and involves people. And if you look at the original page, you'll find a list as long as your arm of engaged and involved people.\".\nWilliams pointed out that \"We did not present Dr Anderson's theory as gospel, although with hindsight it could have been made clearer that this is very much a theory and by no means universally accepted. But we certainly weren't shouting a mathematical revolution from the rooftops. Dr Anderson has, in one or two places, been chastised for coming to the media with his theory instead of his peers \u2014 a sure sign of a quack, boffin and/or crank according to one blogger. Actually, one of our reporters happened to meet him during a demonstration against the closure of the university's physics department a couple of weeks ago, got chatting, and discovered Dr Anderson reckoned he was onto something. He certainly didn't break the door down looking for media coverage.\".\nMathematical analysis.\nMuch of the debate has been muddied by people confusing Anderson's \"transreal numbers\" with the real numbers, and applying theorems from the latter to the former. \nMathematically, Anderson's \"transreal numbers\" are an entirely separate system from the real numbers, and the theorems that hold in the real numbers (many of which people take for granted) do not necessarily hold in the transreal numbers (and vice versa), because they cannot be deduced from the different set of initial axioms.\nOne example of this is the following:\nIn the real number system, one would then proceed to cancel the left-hand side, yielding the contradictory result that formula_10, and many commentators' arguments have proceeded along just such lines. Anderson's axioms, however, \"explicitly disallow\" the cancellation of something and its reciprocal when the something happens to be formula_1. By definition formula_12 does \"not\" equal formula_13 when formula_14.\nAnderson's axioms contain several such differences from those of the real numbers. Mark C. Chu-Carroll notes that, for example, the transreal numbers do not contain a single, unique, additive identity. In the transreal numbers, formula_15 only holds when formula_16. For formula_1, formula_18. Chu-Carroll explains that there is thus no single unique additive identity in the transreal numbers, with formula_1 being its own additive identity, and thus the requirements for a mathematical field are not met by Anderson's transreal numbers.\nSome commentators, at the BBC web page and at Slashdot, have attempted serious mathematical descriptions of what Anderson has done, and subjected it to analysis. One description was that Anderson has taken the field of real numbers and given it complete closure so that all six of the common arithmetic operators were surjective functions, resulting in \"an object which is barely a commutative ring (with operators with tons of funky corner cases)\" and no actual gain \"in terms of new theorems or strong relation statements from the extra axioms he has to tack on\".\nJamie Sawyer, a mathematics undergraduate at the University of Warwick writing in the Warwick Maths Society discussion forum, describes what Anderson has done as deciding that formula_20, the so-called extended real number line, is \"not good enough [...] because of the wonderful issue of what formula_21 is equal to\" and therefore creating a number system formula_22. \nAndrej Bauer stated that Anderson's axioms of transreal arithmetic \"are far from being original. First, you can adjoin formula_23 and formula_24 to obtain something called the extended real line. Then you can adjoin a bottom element to represent an undefined value. This is all standard and quite old. In fact, it is well known in domain theory, which deals with how to represent things we compute with, that adjoining just bottom to the reals is not a good idea. It is better to adjoin many so-called partial elements, which denote approximations to reals. Bottom is then just the trivial approximation which means something like 'any real' or 'undefined real'.\"\nCommentators have pointed out that in the field of mathematical analysis, formula_21 (which Anderson has defined axiomatically to be formula_1) is the limit of several functions, each of which tends to a different value at its limit:\nCommentators have also noted l'H\u00f4pital's rule.\nIt has been pointed out that Anderson's set of transreal numbers is not, unlike the set of real numbers, a mathematical field. Simon Tatham, author of PuTTY, stated that Anderson's system \"doesn't even \"think\" about the field axioms: addition is no longer invertible, multiplication isn't invertible on nullity or infinity (or zero, but that's expected!). So if you're working in the transreals or transrationals, you can't do simple algebraic transformations such as cancelling formula_28 and formula_42 when both occur in the same expression, because that transformation becomes invalid if formula_28 is nullity or infinity. So even the simplest exercises of ordinary algebra spew off a constant stream of 'unless x is nullity' special cases which you have to deal with separately \u2014 in much the same way that the occasional division spews off an 'unless x is zero' special case, only much more often.\" \nTatham stated that \"It's telling that this monstrosity has been dreamed up by a computer scientist: persistent error indicators and universal absorbing states can often be good computer science, but he's stepped way outside his field of competence if he thinks that that also makes them good maths.\", continuing that Anderson has \"also totally missed the point when he tries to compute things like formula_44 using his arithmetic. The reason why things like that are generally considered to be ill-defined is not because of a \"lack\" of facile 'proofs' showing them to have one value or another; it's because of a \"surfeit\" of such 'proofs' all of which disagree! Adding another one does not (as he appears to believe) solve any problem at all.\" (In other words: formula_44 is what is known in mathematical analysis as an indeterminate form.)\nNot a Not a Number.\nTo many observers, it appears that Anderson has done nothing more than re-invent the idea of \"NaN\", a special value that computers have been using in floating-point calculations to represent undefined results for over two decades. In the various international standards for computing, including the IEEE floating-point standard and IBM's standard for decimal arithmetic, a division of any non-zero number by zero results in one of two special infinity values, \"+Inf\" or \"-Inf\", the sign of the infinity determined by the signs of the two operands (Negative zero exists in floating-point representations.); and a division of zero by zero results in NaN.\nAnderson himself denies that he has re-invented NaN, and in fact claims that there are problems with NaN that are not shared by nullity. According to Anderson, \"mathematical arithmetic is sociologically invalid\" and IEEE floating-point arithmetic, with NaN, is also faulty. In one of his papers on a \"perspex machine\" dealing with \"The Axioms of Transreal Arithmetic\" (Jamie Sawyer writes that he has \"worries about something which appears to be named after a plastic\" \u2014 \"Perspex\" being a trade name for polymethyl methacrylate in the U.K..) Anderson writes:\nIn fact, the standard convention for distinguishing the two types of NaNs when writing them down can be seen in ISO/IEC 10967, another international standard for how computers deal with numbers, which uses \"qNaN\" for non-signalling (\"quiet\") NaNs and \"sNaN\" for signalling NaNs. Anderson continues:\n\"In other words,\" writes Scott Lamb, a BSc. in Computer Science from the University of Idaho, \"they are defined, but he doesn't like the definition.\".\nThe main difference between nullity and NaN, according to both Anderson and commentators, is that nullity compares equal to nullity, whereas NaN does not compare equal to NaN. Commentators have pointed out that in very short order this difference leads to contradictory results. They stated that it requires only a few lines of proof, for example, to demonstrate that in Anderson's system of \"transreal arithmetic\" both formula_46 and formula_47, after which, in one commentator's words, one can \"prove anything that you like\". In aiming to provide a complete system of arithmetic, by adding extra axioms defining the results of the division of zero by zero and of the consequent operations on that result, half as many again as the number of axioms of real-number arithmetic, Anderson has produced a self-contradictory system of arithmetic, in accordance with G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorems.\n\"Step 3: Profit!\".\nWhen one thinks of supercomputers made of Perspex, one might think of Orac. However, the \"Perspex\" in Dr Anderson's proposed \"Perspex machine\" is a contraction of \"perspective simplex\". Dr Anderson states that it is a hypercomputer capable of solving the halting problem.\nAccording to Anderson's company presentation to investors, his proposed Perspex machine will have:\nPerspex machines, according to Anderson, implement computer programs as geometrical structures, rather than as a series of instructions. A \"perspex\" is, in Anderson's words, \"a new geometrical computer instruction that looks like an artificial neuron. Any existing computer program can be compiled into a network of these neurons.\".\nCommentators have noted that any machine that disproved the Church\u2013Turing thesis would be a significant development in computer science. Anderson does not claim to have done this, and has not yet created a perspex machine. He states that he has demonstrated, in computer simulations, all of the \"Turing computable subsets of all the properties [of a perspex machine]\".\nStudents at the University of Reading have been working on projects involving Anderson's perspex machines over the past few years. In 2005, student Matthew Spanner, as his fourth year project towards an MEng in Computer Science &amp; Cybernetics from Reading, created a \"compiler, written and implemented in the AI language Pop11, which is capable of compiling C programs into perspex programs that can be executed on the computer, either in Pop11 or using the perspex machine GUI\". \nOne reader-submitted comment appended to the BBC news article read \"Step 1. Create solution 2. Create problem 3. PROFIT!\", an allusion to the business plan employed by the underpants gnomes of the comedy television series \"South Park\". In fact, Anderson does plan to profit from nullity, having registered on the 27th of July, 2006 a private limited company named Transreal Computing Ltd, whose mission statement is \"to develop hardware and software to bring you fast and safe computation that does not fail on division by zero\" and to \"promote education and training in transreal computing\". The company is currently \"in the research and development phase prior to trading in hardware and software\".\nIn a presentation given to potential investors in his company at the ANGLE plc showcase on the 28th of November, 2006, held at the University of Reading, Anderson stated his aims for the company as being:\nTo investors, Anderson makes the following promises:\nHe asks potential investors:\nThe current models of computer arithmetic are, in fact, \"already\" designed to allow programmers to write programs that will continue in the event of a division by zero. The IEEE's Frequently Asked Questions document for the floating-point standard gives this reply to the question \"Why doesn't division by zero (or overflow, or underflow) stop the program or trigger an error?\":\nSimon Tatham stated that there is a basic problem with Anderson's ideas, and thus with the idea of building a transreal supercomputer: \"It's a category error. The Anderson transrationals and transreals are theoretical algebraic structures, capable of representing arbitrarily big and arbitrarily precise numbers. So the question of their error-propagation semantics is totally meaningless: you don't use them for down-and-dirty error-prone real computation, you use them for proving theorems. If you want to use this sort of thing in a computer, you have to think up some concrete representation of Anderson transfoos in bits and bytes, which will (if only by the limits of available memory) be unable to encompass the entire range of the structure. And the point at which you make this transition from theoretical abstract algebra to concrete bits and bytes is precisely where you should also be putting in error handling, because it's where errors start to become possible. We define our theoretical algebraic structures to obey lots of axioms (like the field axioms, and total ordering) which make it possible to reason about them efficiently in the proving of theorems. We define our practical number representations in a computer to make it easy to detect errors. The Anderson transfoos are a consequence of fundamentally confusing the one with the other, and that by itself ought to be sufficient reason to hurl them aside with great force.\"\nGeomerics, a start-up company specializing in simulation software for physics and lighting and funded by ANGLE plc, had been asked to look into Anderson's work by an unnamed client. Rich Wareham, a Senior Research and Development Engineer at Geomerics and a MEng. from the University of Cambridge, stated that Anderson's system \"might be a more interesting set of axioms for dealing with arithmetic exceptions but it isn't the first attempt at just defining away the problem. Indeed it doesn't fundamentally change anything. The reason computer programs crash when they divide by zero is not that the hardware can produce no result, merely that the programmer has not dealt with NaNs as they propagate through. Not dealing with nullities will similarly lead to program crashes.\"\n\"Do the Anderson transrational semantics give any advantage over the IEEE ones?\", Wareham asked, answering \"Well one assumes they have been thought out to be useful in themselves rather than to just propagate errors but I'm not sure that seeing a nullity pop out of your code would lead you to do anything other than what would happen if a NaN or Inf popped out, namely signal an error.\"."}

U.S.-led coalition forces said they were looking through several buildings near Lake Tharthar, in the province of Salahuddin, when Al Qaeda linked militants launched an attack. The U.S. military then said coalition troops returned fire, killing two of the insurgents. As the firefight continued, troops called in the contentious air strikes. The U.S. military said 20 al-Qaeda insurgents, including two women, were killed in the raid.\nLocal officials in Jalameda claimed there were actually 17 victims and that they included five men, six women, and five children. Locals of the area claiming to be relatives showed the children's bodies to journalists and Al Jazeera claimed to have exclusive footage that confirms children were among the victims of the US air raid.\nIraqi reaction included mourners firing into the air overnight as they buried the victims of the raid. Hundreds of chanting residents of Jalameda marched through Ishaqi overnight firing shots and carrying banners that read: \"The people of Ishaqi condemn the mass killing by the occupation forces\".

Litvinenko was a strong critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin and shortly before he died in London from radiation poisoning in late November, Litvinenko accused Putin of ordering his assassination. Putin and other Russian officials strongly denied any prior knowledge of a plot to kill Litvinenko. \nAccording to a report posted late Friday on the Russia Today TV web site, the Federal Agency for Press and Mass Media is gathering publications worldwide to be studied for libelous and offensive comments against Russia in their coverage of the Litvinenko's case. Russia Today TV reported that the Russian government intends to file law suits for libel against international media if there is evidence of journalistic misconduct.\nIn a Voice of America interview shortly before he was poisoned by a radioactive substance polonium-210, former Russian spy Litvinenko had accused Putin of ordering the murder of Russian journalist Anna Politkovskaya to silence her and intimidate other independent journalists. She had been killed by an unknown assailant in Moscow in early October. \nSeveral senior Russian politicians have said that the deaths of Politkovskaya and Litvinenko were playing into the hands of Russia\u2019s enemies and, therefore, could not have been authorized by Moscow. \nThe Russian government's warnings aimed at international journalists follow Putin's largely successful efforts to bring major media outlets in Russia under government control and to limit media criticism of his policies. Reporters Without Borders, a Paris-based nongovernmental organization, has called Putin one of the world's top \"Predators of Press Freedom.\"\nFreeMediaOnline.org, a California-based nonprofit organization which monitors media and supports press freedom worldwide, said that the latest warnings issued by the Federal Agency for Press and Mass Media would prove a major embarrassment for Putin and for Russia if they were carried out. An article on the FreeMediaOnline.org web site claims that even if there is no direct link between the two assassinations and the Kremlin, Putin is ultimately responsible for the climate of lawlessness and suppression of free media that may have contributed to these murders. \nFreeMediaOnline.org also noted that uncovering the truth about the murders of Politkovskaya and Litvinenko would be difficult because independent journalists in Russia have been either silenced or intimidated by President Putin's media advisors, government regulators, and security services. \nPutin insists he is a strong supporter of democracy and press freedom. In a speech to Russian television broadcasters in late November 2006, Putin said that the development of Russian state and society would be unthinkable without independent media, without the possibility of listening to different points of view, and without television. \nPutin's critics point out that he has successfully placed under the Kremlin's control all major nationwide television channels. According to FreeMediaOnline.org, journalists working for these channels no longer dare to offer any significant criticism of Mr. Putin's policies. The organization warned that restrictions on media freedom in Russia have emboldened criminal elements to engage in illegal activities."}

If I were a benign dictator, it would be gone by lunchtime.\" Mr Duynhoven believes that a campaign to educate the public is needed to combat the number of people who die while using their mobile phones while driving. One of the new ways to combat this is suspected to be new road safety measure. The new initiatives will be announced on Wednesday.\n\"I hope that sufficient parliamentarians who read the reports of another young person who obviously wasn't concentrating on her driving will say it's about time something was done,\" Mr Duynhoven said, \"However such a ban would be very difficult to police.\"\nA report, prepared by the Ministry of Transport, will be shown to the government on the dangers of using a mobile phone while driving. Peter Burke, spokesman for the Ministry of Transport, said: \"There's no law against using a cellphone at the moment. There's the whole issue of driver distraction of which cellphone use is a part. But there's been no decision on it yet. Anyone who texts while you're driving is pushing the limits. I don't think anyone would condone texting while driving, it's a recipe for disaster.\"\nEvery year around four fatal crashes occur because the drivers are using their mobile phones while driving. Around 50 non fatal crashes occur each year for the same reason. However the police expect that the actual number is higher.\n\"A lot of drivers are unfortunately their own worst enemy - they're busy talking and texting on the phone and fail to pay attention to what's going on around them. The results can be, and often are, crashes which cause injury and death,\" Rob Lee, spokesman for the police, said.\nSharleen Lloyd, 16-years-old, was killed when she drove her car into a parked trailer after it left the road because she was allegedly texting (SMS) on her mobile phone. Her passenger and boyfriend, Matthew Smit, had non fatal injuries. Andrew Hicks died when he crashed into a powerpole as a result from using his cellphone while driving.\nMany countries already have a ban in place of using a mobile phone while driving, including the United Kingdom and the United States of America. Mr Duynhoven said: \"But in countries where they have bans, they still have people using cellphones while driving. The issue is changing behaviour.\"\nHowever New Zealand does currently have a law which enables police to prosecute someone who doesn't give attention or care to driving."}

This is the highest Liberal support in the 40 percent mark since former Prime Minister Jean Chr\u00e9tien stepped down as prime minister and party leader three years ago.\nThe Tories dropped down two points. The Conservative party, led by Prime Minister Stephen Harper, received 36.3 per cent of the vote and 124 seats in the House of Commons when they were elected in January.

The Green party were the most trusted with 35% and the Liberals in third with 31%.\n\"There is a shock result here for the NDP,\" Graves said. \"Nationally, the Greens are within sight of the NDP...These are the first clear indications we have that the New Democrats could find themselves squeezed into irrelevance in a painful grind between the Liberals and the Greens.\"\nWhen asked which leader who makes the best PM the poll found people preferred Harper over newly elected Liberal leader St\u00e9phane Dion. When asked \"Who best understands the concerns of people like you?\" residents in the Conservative Western Canada preferred Harper. Dion rated higher in Ontario, Quebec, and Atlantic Canada. Outside Quebec and Atlantic Canada, Harper is seen by Canadians as the leader with the \"best vision for the future of the country.\"\nIn Ontario, the Liberals lead stands at a strong 46.9%.

It will also try to decrease the amount of advertising unhealthy food companies are given.\nMr Hodgson said: \"This agreement forms only a small part of what will be necessary to address this challenge, but shows that the government and the food industry are serious about playing our part.\"\nMr Hodgson has confirmed that regulation will now not happen and has said that regulation would have been too costly and too slow to implement.\nFrucor Beverages Ltd and Coca-Cola Amatil are the only companies that provide drinks to schools."}

Authorities located a suicide letter in Halligan's pocket, but have not released its contents\nThe school does not have metal detectors, but according to Roseanne Nyiri, the superintendent of the high school, security at the school will \"now be reviewed.\" Security cameras are on school grounds and police say they have video of the boy firing the gun into the hallway ceiling.\n\"We're all very much aware that even metal detectors have not deterred students from bringing guns into schools in the past,\" added Hummel.\nAccording to Michael Delaurentis, 18 a witness and senior attending the school, the student was a \"nice kid\" and Delaurentis's father, also named Michael, described the student's family as \"wonderful.\" \n\"It just makes you a little in fear of the future, and not just at this school, any school, because I don't think any school is 100 percent secure,\" said Delaurentis's father.\n\"I was walking to my class. I just hear 'Get down.' I heard shots fired into the ceiling and I saw smoke,\" said Delaurentis.\nAccording to police reports, Halligan committed suicide because of his parents threatening to cut back on his after school activities due to poor performance in school. According to Montgomery County District Attorney Bruce L. Castor Jr., \"The picture that's emerging is he was despondent over (the fact) that his grades were down, his parents were taking appropriate steps to limit extracurricular activities to get the grades up, and he saw the things that he felt were important in his life being taken from him.\" but this is not the first time a weapon was brought onto school grounds.\nBack in September, at the same school, a student brought a gun to show-off to other fellow students causing the entire school to be locked down."}

The bill was passed under urgency on the last sitting day of the year. \nThe bill was opposed by two members of parliament from the ACT party and supported by 119 votes. The ACT party voted against the bill to prevent a split of the company into three divisions: retail, business and network.\nUnbundling the local loop means that Telecom, New Zealand's telecommunications monopoly company, will open its lines to competitors and provide \"naked DSL\", which some say will lead to equal and fair competition in the Internet sector. The decision to unbundle the local loop occurred earlier this year when a mole leaked the proposal and the government had to make the announcement earlier than planned.\nThe bill will also enable minister of communications Cunliffe and the Commerce Commission the powers to split Telecom into the three divisions, after public consultation. The Telecommunications Commissioner will also have more power to implement the changes and monitor the implementation.\nThe bill will ensure that consumers do not have to purchase a phone account when signing up for an Internet account; before the bill was passed, a NZ$10 fee was added to the bill if the phone account was not with the Internet service provider.\nThe Honourable David Cunliffe, minister of communications, said that \"We now have a clear, firm mandate from the people of New Zealand. Kiwis are demanding fast, 'all you can eat' broadband, which this legislation is designed to deliver.\"\nHon Cunliffe said that history has been made with the new bill as it will bring New Zealanders faster and better broadband. \"What some people said couldn't be done is being done. What some people said wouldn't work is being given the opportunity to work with an overwhelming majority. The bill equips New Zealand for the new digital age\u2014 an age where the smart use of technology will determine our continued prosperity as a country and make economic transformation a reality.\""}

However, subsequent tests revealed that the senator did not suffer a stroke or a heart attack. He was transported to George Washington University Hospital by ambulance, where he was diagnosed with a congenital arteriovenous malformation and underwent brain surgery. He is currently \"recovering without complications\" and \"appropriately responsive to both word and touch\" but it still in critical condition and being monitored. Additional surgery may be required.\nCurrently, the US Senate is controlled by the Republican Party; however, when the Senate reconvenes after the recent midterm elections the Democrats will have a one senator majority. Under the 17th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, state legislatures can give their governor the power to appoint someone else to take over, but this power can only be used in cases where the senator vacates his seat. Historically, this applies to death or resignation, but serious illness does not count.\nShould Johnson die or resign, the Republican governor, Mike Rounds, will likely appoint a Republican in Johnson's place. This would bring the Senate to a 50-50 tie for organizational purposes and give Vice President Dick Cheney the tie-breaking vote, thus letting the Republicans control the Senate. This appointment would last until the end of Johnson's term, in 2008.\nIf he does not recover the senate has the power to force him out, but historically the senate has not done so. On Nov. 23, 1969, GOP Sen. Karl Mundt of South Dakota, who previously held Johnson's seat, had a debilitating stroke. He later endured months of speech and physical therapy at his Washington home. Mundt's wife, Mary, refused to vacate the seat despite pressure from the state's Republicans. Mund remained formally in his seat until his term expired in 1973. In the past multiple other senators have become incapacitated for months or even years and kept their seat, but party control of the senate was not involved."}

However, during the broadcast it became clear that the report was actually a documentary meant to stir up the debate on the position of the states and regions in the federal country Belgium. Walloon Minister of Media Fadila Laanan said that the message \"this is fiction\" appeared only at her request, after she had received several \"panic\" calls and text messages.\nDuring the report, King Albert II of Belgium was alleged to have left the country to show his disagreement with the unilateral Flemish decision. Several politicians (Jean-Marie Dedecker, Jean-Marie Happart, Herman De Croo etc.) contributed in the making of the program, giving their reaction to the news and explaining some of their views on Flemish independence. There were images of thousands celebrating in Antwerp and flag-waving independence supporters in front of the Royal Palace in Laken, but also trams stuck at the \"new border\", and traffic jams in the direction of Brussels Airport. After a while more comedy entered the report; two Flemish policemen where shown to be called into action to patrol the border, and Guy Vanhengel (VLD) was interviewed inside the Atomium, the monument symbolic of Belgium, where he spoke of a \"monumental\" mistake. The report was followed by a debate on the subject of the Flemish independence movement.\nThe head of news at RTBF reacted: \"We obviously scared many people - maybe more than we expected,\" and this was indeed the case. A spokesman of Belgian Prime Minister Verhofstadt stated late last night that the newspaper \"Le Monde\" had already called them, and that CNBC already thought it was not fictional. Several embassies reported the news to their countries, and a Belgian representative in the European Parliament reported \"consternation\". A survey by the RTBF shows that 89% of spectators admit being fooled by the report, with even 6% continuing to believe it after the fiction notice appeared.\nLeaders on both sides of the country spelled out their appall: Elio Di Rupo said it is \"...unacceptable to play with the institutions and the stability of the country.\", while Yves Leterme, Minister-President of the Flemish government, regretted that some of the Flemish demands were caricatured. Pro-independence politicians such as Filip Dewinter and Bart De Wever didn't hide their approval of the fake news report. Several politicians have criticized the method used by the RTBF, and expect that this will reflect badly on the credibility and reputation of the channel. The usual RTBF news studio and anchorman were used to make the fictional report.\nThe incident is headline news in Belgium. The report comes at a time of a growing discussion on the topic of granting Flanders more independence from Belgium, one year before the elections in Belgium. Only last week, the pro-Flemish political parties CD&amp;V and NVA announced that they would demand a major constitutional change during the next federal negotiations."}

A number of large trees have been downed and heavy rains have caused minor flooding in many areas of the city. According to first-hand reports as many as 1 million people and several large organizations such as Microsoft are without power this morning.\nFlood, storm, and strong wind watches were in effect last night as a rare thunderstorm system moved into the Pacific Northwest region, hitting areas from Seattle to Portland with high winds and heavy rains. Interstate 5 through Seattle was closed at its intersection with Mercer Street due to standing water. The State Route 520 floating bridge, a major conduit across Lake Washington to the technology-rich Eastside was closed and its drawspan opened to protect it from storm damage well into Friday. Local roads throughout the region were strewn with debris, especially evergreen branches and leaves. Authorities advised people to stay off the roads.\nFour deaths were reported in connection with the storm as of Friday. A Seattle woman died in the basement of her home after floodwaters caused the basement door to close and jam shut. Two others died in outlying areas after tall Northwest evergreens fell on their vehicles, and a man in Grays Harbor, near the Pacific coast, died in his sleep after a tree fell on his mobile home. KOMO news reported a caller saying a 100-foot evergreen had fallen into his house. \nDowned trees and high winds also brought down powerlines throughout Western Washington. Seattle City Light, the municipal electric utility for the city, reported a peak of 175,000 customers without power, most in the north and south ends of the city, as well as the east edge of town and the Green Lake area. \nPuget Sound Energy, the electric utility for much of the Seattle metro area, reported 700,000 customers (over 66%) without power, with the area around Seattle the worst hit. PSE, which had already enlisted additional powerline workers from neighboring states, did not send crews out until mid Friday morning due to continued high winds. Estimates for power restoration were anywhere from a few days to over a week. Island County, at the mouth of Puget Sound, was completely without power.\nSchools in Seattle and throughout its suburbs were closed Friday, many due to power outages. The city of Mercer Island, connected to the mainland only by Interstate 90, is reportedly inaccessible.\nThe \"Seattle Post-Intelligencer\" failed to print due to power failures at the printing facility, which had redundant power feeds from both the Seattle utility as well as PSE. It is the first time in 70 years that the paper has not been printed. The \"Seattle Times\", a competing paper under a joint operating agreement, managed to print only 13,000 copies of its regular circulation of over 200,000. The papers located alternate facilities to print a reduced version of their Saturday editions, and their joint Sunday issue was also expected to be reduced.\nAt Sea-Tac Airport, three terminals were shut down overnight due to the storm. Concourse A and the South Satellite terminal lost power, and a blown-out window caused Concourse C to also close. All terminals were back in working order by midday Friday. Many flights were delayed or cancelled. Likewise, in Oregon, Portland International Airport reported at least 40 flights cancelled. At Seattle's Boeing Field, winds flipped a private plane over, colliding with another plane.\nThe Seattle Seahawks vs. San Francisco 49ers football game was delayed 15 minutes. A pre-game power surge temporarily took the Qwest Field's video displays offline. The gridiron was plagued by standing water, as the stadium's loudspeakers played \"Who'll Stop The Rain?\" shortly before kickoff.\nThursday night's storm comes after a previous regional storm in the Seattle area earlier in the week, in which trees in a few Seattle suburbs fell onto roads, powerlines, and two school buses. In those incidents no one was hurt, and there were a few spotty power outages.\nThis is the second serious storm to hit the Northwest since Thanksgiving, In late November, record-setting snowfall had a similar disabling effect on the region."}

However, when they removed the nerve cells, the mice did not develop the disorder.\nAccording to Dr. Hans Michael Dosch, a senior scientist at Toronto's Hospital for Sick Children and the study's lead investigator, this indicates the diabetes may be a disease of the nervous system, not just an autoimmune disease.\nTraditionally, research has primarily been concentrated on the immune system and the reasons why it attacks and destroys the insulin-producing cells of the pancreas, which are grouped in islets.\nBut Dosch, working alongside colleagues at Sick Kids, the University of Calgary in Alberta and Maine's Jackson Laboratory, identified a control circuit between islet cells and their associated sensory nerves.\nDisruption of this circuit led to inflammation around the islets and eventually to their destruction. Without these cells, the mice were unable to produce insulin.\n\"This control circuit is the real cause of diabetes,\" Dosch said.\nExperts agree the findings, reported yesterday in the journal \"Cell\", will dramatically change the foundations of diabetes research.\n\"It really is a breakthrough for the diabetes community,\" said Pam Ohashi, a professor of immunology at the University of Toronto and a senior scientist at the Campbell Family Institute for Breast Cancer Research.\nDosch plans to move quickly in transferring his tests on lab mice to human subjects. He plans to launch a clinical trial in January to figure out if human patients who have a high risk of Type 1 diabetes have the same sensory nerve abnormalities displayed by the mice.\n\"If they do, then we have fantastic new therapeutic strategies,\" said Dosch, who is also a professor of pediatrics and immunology at U of T (University of Toronto).\nMichelle Wing knows the toll diabetes takes on a family. Her 8-year-old daughter Marielle has the disorder, and her two young sons, ages 4 and 18 months, are considered high risk for developing it. Diabetes runs every aspect of their lives, she said, explaining how the family is bound by an extensive and relentless routine of blood tests, insulin injections and strict meal times. Dosch plans to invite the family to participate in the clinical trial.\nWing said she was moved to tears when she learned that researchers may have found a way to one day prevent Type 1 diabetes.\n\"Seeing what Marielle goes through every day of her life, to prevent other children from going through that,\" Wing said. \"To prevent other parents in the middle of the night worrying their child will go into a diabetic coma,\" she mused. \"It's fantastic that there could be a prevention of this for other children.\"\nMore than 200,000 Canadians suffer from Type 1 diabetes, which mostly develops in childhood or in the teen years. It is not to be confused with the more common Type 2 diabetes, where the body doesn't make enough insulin or use the existing insulin efficiently.\nInsulin is a hormone produced by the islet cells that stabilizes blood sugar levels in the body. Sufferers of Type 1 diabetes have to take regimented daily insulin injections and continuously monitor their blood sugars. The injections are not a cure, and many patients still develop side-effects of the disease like stroke, blindness, heart attack, and kidney failure.\nMore research will be put in motion quickly to see if the same treatment applied to the lab mice will be effective in humans for preventing Type 1 diabetes, or better still, if it will shed new light on treatment methods for Type 2 sufferers, according to Dosch.\nAlso, in a surprising twist, the researchers also found that injecting substance P, a chemical secreted by nerve cells, into the mice who had damaged or inflamed islet cells, not only eliminated the inflammation process, but reversed it.\n\"The blood glucose normalizes overnight and it stays low for weeks to months \u2014 this is with a single shot,\" Dosch said.\n\"We now have 4-month-old mice that are non-diabetic that used to be diabetic,\" he added.\nDr. Ehud Ur, professor of medicine at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia and chair of the clinical and scientific division of the Canadian Diabetes Association cautioned that the research is still in its early days. Like some other experts, he is skeptical about whether diabetes can be cured, noting that these findings have no relevance to people who already have Type 1 diabetes.\n\"We have a whole new target for therapy,\" he said. \"It's always been the pancreas or the immune system. Now we have a new player.\"\nStill, he knows that the discovery of nerves controlling pancreatic functions is a major step towards developing more efficient treatment for the millions affected worldwide."}

One was Gary McHale, a Richmond Hill, Ontario man who entered the occupied land in Caledonia, Ontario to organize a rally against the ongoing aboriginal occupation. Mark Vandermaas of London, Ontario was also arrested. Vandermaas was forced to the ground by police officers, who ripped the flag out of his hand when he crossed the police line. There were approximately 100 protesters rallying with McHale.\nAccording to news reports, McHale intended to put the Canadian flag across the street from DCE (Douglas Creek Estates) where the aboriginal occupation has been ongoing for 10 months. Back in late October the aboriginals had already put up their flags across from the DCE property and the OPP made no attempt to stop them. However, on Dec. 2 residents of Caledonia attempted to put up Canadian flags with Yellow ribbons in various areas in Caledonia. When they tried to put up a Canadian Flag across from DCE property the OPP sent in 100 officers to stop them.\nMr. McHale called for people to gather on Dec. 16 to try to put up Canadian Flags across from DCE property on the same hydro poles that Natives already had put up their flags. Mr. McHale stated, \"I have asked 2 dozen OPP officers why it is legal to have a Native Flag up along the highway but illegal for a Canadian Flag to be up and I have never received an answer.\"\n\"The OPP set up a line just about a hundred yards away from that site and several people were able to cross that line. They got through a farmer's field on far left side of where I'm standing here,\" said CTV reporter Joel Bowey. \"We're hearing that Mr. McHale got in the middle of the street and put a flag down there, and that's when he and the other man from London, Ont. were arrested. So far all we know is that those two men have been arrested and there are no other arrests at this point.\"\nThe OPP said the men were arrested for \"breaking the peace\" and noted that it is not a criminal offence. Police had warned them about crossing into the disputed land before.\n\"I've now said that Mr. McHale's plans were counterproductive and potentially dangerous to what we've been trying to do there, and that is to reach a peaceful settlement,\" said David Ramsay, Ontario's minister of aboriginal affairs. \"I've twice now offered Mr. McHale the opportunity to protest at Queen's Park [the site of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario building]. In fact, I said I would sponsor his rally and set up a platform and a microphone, a PA system for him.\"\nMayor Marie Trainer of Haldimand County, were Caledonia is located, said: \"The next meeting or two will be wasted on frivolous stuff again instead of getting down to business.\" Trainer also says that he should not be entering the town and did not specify what side she is on or if she is not taking any side.\nThis was not the first time Gary McHale entered the disputed land. On October 15, 2006, McHale with approximately 2000 (as reported by local newspapers) participants rallied in Caledonia, but the OPP blocked the entrance to the occupied site.\n\"Our fight is not with the natives, we're just trying to be equal in a democratic Canada,\" said Christine McHale, wife of Gary McHale.\n\"When a native commits a serious crime or any crime, they stand by and watch the crime take place and will not do anything to stop the crime. When a resident does the simplest thing, even putting up a Canadian flag or drinking a coffee in a lawn chair across some magic line, they will send in scores of officers to arrest the person,\" said Gary McHale. \"We have to take a stand and say to police forces that there is one set of laws for all citizens.\" \n\"Police have one set of policies for natives and another set of policies for non-natives,\" he said before the rally. \"It's against our Charter of Rights, that clearly says there's not to be any discriminations based on their religion, beliefs, race or their skin colour.\"\nMcHale has been long critical of the Ontario Provincial Police over the land claim saying that they treat aboriginals differently. McHale and his wife operate a website called Caledonia Wake Up Call.com, were they detail what they describe as police bias."}

When Jimbo nominated me chair, my thoughts were mostly oriented toward the desire that the change happens smoothly, with no wrong perception of the community or in the press. The fact I became chair is first the sign the organisation is maturing.\nThis said, it is *difficult* to become the chair after Jimbo. Not internally, as all board members were in agreement and happy with the switch. Jimbo is also very helpful.

I was probably an average editor on the French and English wikipedia. My achievement is probably rather in my involvement in community building. When I joined Wikipedia, the project was essentially monolingual, and it took a lot of dedication to really make it multilingual, with recognition of the importance of cultural diversity. As an admin on several projects, steward for over 3 years now, meta-oriented person, I was hopefully one of these \"glue people\" who helped to develop the global side of our projects.\nWN: When did you first join the Wikimedia projects?\nFD: February 2002 as an anonymous on the English wikipedia. I later created my pseudonyme, Anthere, and joined the embryo of French community (less than 10 people) in may 2002. \nWN: What is your view on the annual 'pranking' of Wikipedia on April 1st?\nFD: I... never participated to the annual pranking of the English Wikipedia on April 1st?

What is your impression of this?\nFD: Fabulous job ! I receive more and more phone calls of people willing to use an image from the Commons, which is for me a good measure of this site success. On another note, this project is specifically dear to my heart, because it is one where all languages mix. It is the true Babel Tower (which Wikipedia is not), where people work together, sometimes not sharing even one language. The current state is fabulous. And there is much left to do.\nWN: If you could describe yourself in one word, what would it be, and why?\nFD: I often sign \"ant\", mostly because of a wiki I participated to several\nyears ago, where providing a real name was mandatory; I cheated, and called myself AntHere. The ant is a social insect. The ant is very industrious. The ant is never alone, it dies if alone. The ant lives with others in an anthill. And the head of the anthill is a Queen :-) (the Queen essentially being a mother actually).\nSo, Anthere or AntHere is just THE word.\nWN: Considering past donations, and the rate we are going at now, do you think we will meet our goal by the deadiline of our current fundraiser?\nFD: That is a very good question. I do not know. I can only hope, because the more money we'll make, the more we'll be able to make the suitable investments for the future of the projects. According to our Executive Director, Brad Patrick, our basic operations right now, cost around 75 000 dollars per month. This does not count the investments in hardware, which should be around $1,670,000 before June, nor the additional costs in terms of hosting, and bandwidth, due to the ever growing traffic. Add to this the much delayed need to hire more staff and project specific expenses. An insufficient fundraiser at this point would mean we'll have to organise a new one in the next few months; However, we are currently exploring other ways to collect money, now possible thanks to the completed audit. So let's be optimistic.\nWN: Wikinews gives people credentials (excuse my spelling) which allow us to report in the field. I, myself am not accredited, but what's your view on this? \nFD: I understood this was extremely helpful to approach candidates for interviews and participate to special events. I trust the Wikinews community to be careful in giving these credentials.\nWN: If you were explaining Wikipedia to someone who has never heard of Wikipedia (I know, impossible), what would you say?\nFD: In the shortest way, an encyclopedia, which aims to bring knowledge to the largest number of people on Earth. Which means 1) lower the financial barrier to access (it's free of charge), 2) lower the linguistic barrier (we work in over 200 languages), 3) lower the barrier of use (it is under a free licence which allow anyone to reuse the content). On top, an oddity, it is a collective work, with open access and multiauthoring."}

The English bowling dominated, dismissing Australia for 244 off 71 overs. Michael Hussey was the only Australian to build an innings, scoring an unbeaten 74. Recalled left-arm orthodox spinner Monty Panesar claimed 5-92, and teammate Stephen Harmison took four wickets. \nEngland went in to bat late on day one, and lost two wickets for 51 runs before the close of play. On the resumption of play on day two, the wickets continued to fall, and they were eventually bowled out for 215. Kevin Pietersen made 70 for the visitors, whilst Stuart Clark took 3-49 for the home team.\nThe second innings of Australia was a vast improvement. They lost one wicket before stumps on day two, and resumed at 1-119 on day three. They proceeded to dominate England in 40oC+ temperatures, with three Australians - Michael Clarke, Michael Hussey and Adam Gilchrist - scoring centuries. Gilchrist's century was the second-fastest in history, reaching 100 in 57 deliveries. Australia declared their innings closed late on day three at 5-527.\nEngland required 557 to win in their second innings, or needed to bat for two-and-a-bit days to salvage a draw and keep the 2006-07 series alive. They were 1-18 by the close of play on day three. On day four, English batsman Alastair Cook scored his first Ashes test century, stalling Australia's roll towards victory. He was assisted by teammate Ian Bell, who made 87.\nCook was dismissed by paceman Glenn McGrath on 116 in the third last over of day four, sparking an English batting collapse; the visitors were 5-265 at stumps on day four, after losing three quick wickets. Day five saw England bat well for an hour, before collapsing after losing captain Andrew Flintoff to be all out for 350 two balls after lunch. Shane Warne finished with 4-123 in the second innings, whilst Pietersen was unbeaten on 59.\nMichael Hussey was named Man of the Match for his two innings of 74 not out and 103.\nThe fourth test will begin on Boxing Day (December 26) at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. Warne requires just one wicket to be the first bowler in history to reach 700 Test wickets."}

Youth workers and youth workers being trained aged 16-years and 17-years will see an increase of $0.80 to $9.00, remaining at 80% of the adult minimum wage.\nMs Dyson said: \"The boost in the minimum wage will ensure that lower paid workers share the benefits of economic growth, encourage people to join the workforce and provide protection for some of New Zealand\u2019s most vulnerable workers.\"\nThe Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand has welcomed the announcement. Sue Bradford, spokesperson for the Greens' Industrial Relations, said: \"There is no better time than during a strong economy for New Zealand to boost the current poverty level minimum wages.\"\nMs Bradford said: \"The rise announced today is not overly generous. When cost of living adjustments are taken into account, the $12 an hour minimum wage level called for by the Greens during the 2005 election campaign, has now moved to just over $13 per hour. If one applied the European Union social standard - which sets the minimum wage at two thirds of the average wage - we would be setting New Zealand's minimum wage at $13.66.\"\nHowever HealthCare Providers New Zealand is criticising the wage increases as currently the difference in minimum wage and the average caregiver wage rate is 10% ($10.25 and $11.33 respectively). Martin Taylor, chief executive officer, said: \"If more funding is not made available then the government is agreeing to caregiving becoming a minimum wage occupation.\"\nMr Taylor said: \"We believe caregiving is an important job that deserves better wages, but you cannot pay out more than you are funded for. This sector is depended on government funding and we have already been waiting 9 months for DHBs to agree to our funding claim for the last minimum wage increase.\"\nThe government believes that the change will benefit 110,000 adults of which the majority are woman, and 9,200 youth workers.\n\"With four months till the changes come into effect, businesses will have time to prepare.

The state National Guard has been deployed to aid in distributing supplies.\nThousands were still without power in the coastal and Puget Sound regions, though most urban areas were back with power as late as Sunday afternoon, and outages were mostly contained to rural and unincorporated areas. Puget Sound Energy reported that roughly 500,000 energy customers out of the 700,000 who lost power were back in service by Sunday evening. Seattle City Light, the city's independent municipal utility, reported only 18,000 customers still without power as of Monday morning, down from a peak of 175,000.\nFour additional deaths related to the post-storm power outage had been reported as of Monday, bringing the total number of casualties to eight. A man in Gig Harbor was electrocuted by a downed power line while walking his dog. Another man in Spanaway died when an unattended candle caused a house fire.\nTwo died from carbon monoxide poisoning in separate incidents related to use of combustion devices indoors. Roughly a hundred additional cases of non-fatal carbon monoxide poisoning were reported from people using generators or grills indoors. News radio stations and authorities warned the public to stay away from downed power lines and not to use grills indoors. Dr. Neil Hampson at Virginia Mason's hyperbaric unit, where a number of victims were being treated, warned it could be \"the worse case of carbon monoxide poisioning in the country\".\nOn Monday, four new carbon-monoxide deaths were reported in a family of five in Burien due to an indoor generator. In Canada, which had some damage from the week's storms, two southern British Columbia carbon monoxide deaths were also reported. Despite continued warnings, hospitals are still seeing cases of carbon monoxide poisoning, including a family in w:Shoreline, Washington which was taken to the hospital after they reported symptoms due to their indoor grill. Neighbors of the Burien family suggested that noise concerns are leading people to place noisy generators indoors.\nThe massive power outage left many stores and gas stations unable to operate. Some businesses opened with the help of backup generators, conserving power by foregoing heat and refrigeration, exterior lighting, and half the interior lighting. Most stores had run out of \"D\" size batteries, the most common size for flashlights, as well as firelogs and other essentials. Gasoline shortages were reported throughout the area, with one man selling excess fuel for as high as $15 per gallon, over 5 times the average retail price. \nThe Red Cross set up shelters throughout King and other affected counties for those without power or food. Hotels reported no vacancies as whole families took shelter in powered hotels, especially in Seattle. Restaurants also reported brisk business as people sought out a hot cooked meal. Tons of perishable food were expected to have become unsafe after the prolonged outage disabled refrigerators and freezers both in homes and stores.\nMany of those without power visited nearby friends and family living where power had been continued or restored, while others traveled out of the area to places that had not been affected. The widespread outage made long-distance traveling treacherous on some major routes, with roadway lighting, cellular towers, and services disabled by the outage.\nMost major roadways which were closed during the storm were reopened on Friday. The 520 Floating Bridge over Lake Washington, a major conduit to the technology-rich Eastside, sustained minor damage. Amtrak, which had halted its Cascades service, resumed Saturday evening. Sea-Tac Airport resumed operations with a reduced flight load, after a transient power outage on Friday disabled the airport radar and caused all planes to be grounded until it was repaired."}

The first report was received by emergency services at 19.17 CET. 26 people were involved in the incident, when the road collapsed under them in a landslide. About 500 metres of the road slid down a slope into a small stream alongside, leaving a crater 200 metres wide and two to three metres deep. Both sides of the road (which in this area is single carriageway) have collapsed and the road has now been closed by the emergency services between Saltk\u00e4llan and Torp.\nPolice spokesperson Thomas Fuxborg said to SVT that \"it is a very large accident\". So far no fatalities have been reported, and SVT news programme Aktuellt reports that all the people involved in the accident have been rescued and have only suffered minor injuries (video of news broadcast; video showing the scene of the accident). On the morning of 21 December SVT reported that all 26 people involved in the incident had been rescued. Though none of them had major injuries 13 people were taken to hospital, of which all but one had been discharged by the morning of 21 December. The injuries consisted of \"some broken arms and legs and back pains, and many shocked of course,\" according to Lars-G\u00f6ran Eskilsson, deputy head of rescue services in Uddevalla.\nThe site of the landslide is the most recently opened section of the E6, which has been undergoing rebuilding work. The cause of the landslide is not known, but there is speculation that the unusually heavy rain that has recently hit the area could have undermined the road. Geologists have warned that there may be further landslides, so the safety cordons are being moved back. \"Work is currently underway to move the cordons back to secure the area,\" said Leif Larsson, head of rescue services in Uddevalla, on the night of 20 December. Two properties nearby have been evacuated because of the risk for further landslides.\nAccording to G\u00f6teborgs-Posten, the Bohusbanan railway line (which runs parallel with the E6 road) has also been affected. The landslide reportedly cut an electricity line leaving the railway without power. A passenger train on its way from Munkedal was stopped only 600-700 metres from the scene of the landslide. SVT reports that 300 metres of the railway embankment has collapsed.\nThe E6 is the main road between Oslo, the capital city of Norway, and Gothenburg, so the landslide is expected to cause major disruption to traffic. The 15,000 vehicles that pass the collapsed section of road every day will be rerouted on minor roads via Dals-Ed. Vehicles coming from the south will have to leave the E6 before the Uddevalla bridge and follow roads 174, 166 and 164 before returning to the motorway at Skee. \"There will be very big diversions, about 50-60 kilometres. We will have long queues because it involves many vehicles and much smaller roads,\" said Tomas Andersson, crisis manager at the Swedish National Road Administration.

More specifically, Polidoras blamed indirectly the Synaspismos leftist party for covering rallies by anarchists and called Synaspismos' leadership to make clear whether or not approves violence from the side of leftist and anarchist groups which take part in big anti-governmental rallies. Moreover, the Greek Public Order Minister blamed PASOK, today's leading opposition party, for being fully responsible for not doing something in order to break down the teams of anarchist groups during its 20 years of governance.\nThe answers from the side of PASOK and Synaspismos were immediate and blamed Mr.Polidoras for being exposed and for trying to manipulate citizens, making references to the past of Greek politics. Furthermore, in a short debate between Polidoras and PASOK's parliamentary representative, Petros Efthemiou on ALPHA TV, the second called Minister to apply those policies that would eliminate violence in demonstrations instead of blaming political parties and former governments. Addressing to the Greek Parliament later, Byron Polidoras clarified his statement saying that he fully respects all parties and that he didn't mean to blame the opposition as supporters of anarchist groups.\nAccording to recent official data, criminal cases and more specifically juvenile violence has been increased during the last year in Greece. The issue came back on focus, after a 10-year old boy was arrested during violent clashes between police and anarchists, outside Aristotle University in Thessaloniki."}

The head of the earthquake monitoring agency in the Philippines disputed the Japanese agency's warnings, however.\nConflicting reports have placed the magnitude of the quake between 6.7 and 7.2 on the Richter Scale, with the Taiwan Central Weather Bureau marking it at 6.7, the United States Geological Survey estimating it at 7.1, and the Japan Meteorological Agency putting the magnitude at 7.2.\nDespite the Japanese Meteorological Agency's warning of a tsunami threat to the Philippines, Renato Solidum, the director of the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology, denied that a tsunami is headed towards the Philippines, saying that the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center in Hawaii had not released any tsunami advisory. Nevertheless, Solidum said that residents in low-lying areas in the Philippines should, as a precaution, move to higher ground.\nIn the aftermath of the quake, news agencies have aired reports of collapsed houses, hotel guests being trapped in elevators, and telephone outages due to severed lines across Taiwan. Two people were reported killed and 42 injured.\nThe earthquake has damaged six submarine fiber-optic communications cables, restricting internet access to millions of users in Asia and Australia.\nHome users are experiencing severe connection issues, with timeouts becoming very common. The Internet Storm Center is reporting a 100% packet loss on certain routers. A sample ping test from Singapore to Wikinews came up with a 380 millisecond average round trip at 50% packet loss.\nThe financial markets are facing an even more alarming situation, with financial news and stock quotes from the U.S. and Europe not being able to reach Asian markets.\nRepairing the lines \"is not a matter of days,\" says Hong Seoung-Yong, a ministry official from South Korea handling the problem. \nTaiwan's internet capacity has dropped to 40%, and consequently the networks there are jammed. Service providers may choose to bypass those lines in favour of European ones, say a spokesman for Japanese telecoms firm KDDI Corp, Satoru Ito.\nThe quake took place exactly two years from the day that the 2004 Indian Ocean Earthquake struck, devastating Southeast Asia. That 2004 earthquake registered as a magnitude 9.1, and caused a tsunami with waves reaching as high as 33 feet."}

This was stated by a representative of one of the companies on Thursday, December 28.\nMuslix64 is the name of the hacker that announced the details of the process he performed in order to unlock the encryption. The purpose of the Advanced Access Content System (AACS) is to prevent pirate copying. It is supposed to restrict the devices that are able to play the DVDs. \nSuch companies like Walt Disney Co., Intel Corp., Microsoft Corp., Toshiba Corp. and Sony Corp. were the ones to create the encryption so to defend the high-definition formats. The latter encompass \"HD-DVD\" format developed by Toshiba, with a series of other corporations, and \"Blu-ray\" format developed by Sony and its partners in this enterprise.\nThe hacker launched on a famous hacker website his decryption codes and posted a short film on a video site. The film displayed the process of copying several films, like \"Full Metal Jacket\" by Warner Bros and \"Van Helsing\" brought by Universal Studios. \nMuslix64 also mentioned that he is going to post some more source codes on the second day of the New Year. According to his words the codes will allow copying a wider variety of titles.\nThe inability of companies to protect their production could find themselves in a difficult situation. This concerns especially those that have the goal of boosting their revenues. They are aware of the fact that the standard DVD format is not as popular as it was. The sales of DVD movies in 2005 gained around 24 billion dollars for the industry of movie making.\nThe technology expert Adrian Kingsley-Hughes wrote on the ZDNet.com (tech-site) that the decryption code developed by Muslix64 looks quite genuine. He also mentioned that the decryption code for HD-DVD might give some advantages for those that look forward to backup discs. However in general none of the rival formats will be in advantage of this possible hack."}

Two people were killed and dozens injured.\nFour explosions went off almost simultaneously in different parts of Thailand's capital city, at around 6:00 p.m. local time (1100 GMT).\nThe first blast was in a bus-stop shelter at Victory Monument, which is a busy hub for public transportation. Another blast occurred nearby. Five people were injured, and one of them died later at a hospital.\nAnother fatal attack was in the Khlong Toei port district near the Na Ranong intersection, where a bomb hidden in a trash can near a Chinese spirit shrine exploded and injured seven people, one of them a 10-year-old girl. Another was a 61-year-old man who later died at a hospital. The blast caused a secondary explosion to some nearby cooking-gas cylinders.\nSeventeen people were wounded in a blast at a police box near a Big C supermarket at the Saphan Kwai intersection. A witness there said a man dropped a grenade from a pedestrian bridge.\nAnother blast was at a police box on Sukhumvit Soi 62. There were no injuries.\nA blast was reported at a police box in Nonthaburi Province on the northern outskirts of Bangkok. There was another explosion at a Tesco Lotus store in Prachachuen, while another was planted in a trash bin at Seacon Square, a shopping mall in suburban Bangkok's Prawet district. A bomb squad was able to defuse the device without mishap. \nOther suspicious packages are being investigated by police at locations throughout the capital, the iTV network in Thailand has reported. The New Year's countdown at CentralWorld was held at around 9:00 p.m. with police and Bangkok Governor Apirak Kosayothin then urging the thousands of gathered revelers to \"go home and stay in peace.\"\nThe attacks are unprecedented in Bangkok. However, Thailand has had a turbulent year, with a coup d'\u00e9tat on September 19 in which the military ousted prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra. Since then, there have been a number of schools burnt by suspected Thaksin sympathizers in various parts of the country.\nThere is also the ongoing violence by Muslim separatists in the , which has left 1,900 people dead since 2004.\nIt was not immediately clear if the bombings had anything to do with the coup or the southern insurgency."}

George W. Bush said it was a \"milestone\" on the way to a democratic Iraq. Also, many Iranian politicians think that the execution was a \"victory for the Iraqi people\". The Polish foreign minister said he was an opponent of death penalty, but would make an exception in this case. Australian foreign minister Alexander Downer referred to the death of Saddam Hussein as an \"important step\" on the way towards a historical judgement of Hussein's \"tyrannous regime\". He thinks that it will lead to an opportunity to strengthen the process of reconciliation.\nOther European countries were at odds with this response. These include the U.K., Finland, France, Switzerland, the Vatican and Germany, which stand for the worldwide abolition of the death penalty. The main reason given by them was that even incredibly heinous crimes do not justify execution. The Vatican's spokesperson, Federico Lombardi, said that there was \"the risk that it would incite people to seek revenge and produce more violence\". Germany's minister of state in the Office for Foreign Affairs, Erler, said that Saddam Hussein's crimes could not be doubted, but the German government would stay with its general attitude of rejecting death penalty.\nRussia also expressed regret for the execution. An official of the Russian Office for Foreign Affairs, Michail Kamynin, warned against an intensification of the military and political situation in Iraq and against a rise of ethnical-confessional tensions. Libya ordered a three-day national mourning. Head of state Ghadhafi stopped all celebrations and ceremonies for the Eid al-Adha half-masting all flags on governmental buildings. The Palestinian foreign minister criticised the execution, too. There had often been disagreements, but nevertheless, the execution had been wrong, he said.\nThe organisation \"Human Rights Watch\" criticised the proceedings against Hussein as having \"shown severe deficiencies\". The World Council of Churches expressed its critical attitude towards the execution of Saddam Hussein: \"Every time a person's life is taken it is part of a big tragedy.\" Amnesty international very much criticised the proceedings: the execution was apparently a foregone conclusion. The appeal court had only created the impression of legitimacy in flawed proceedings, they said.\nThe Council of Europe condemned the execution and called on Iraq to abolish the death penalty.\nMeanwhile, at 4:00 a.m. this morning local time (1:00 a.m. (GMT)), the former leader's remains were buried in Awja, close to Tikrit, the home town of Hussein, as reported by CNN."}

It probably came as a surprise to the entire Alamo Bowl record crowd of 65,875 as Iowa ran out to a 14-0 lead in the first quarter. Iowa almost extended their lead to 21-3 just before the half, but for a touchdown pass called back for an illegal receiver who lined up on the Iowa line of scrimmage. \nTexas quarterback Colt McCoy, who began the season as a red-shirt freshman, capped the Texas comeback in the 3rd quarter with a 72-yard pass to tailback Jamaal Charles to take the lead at 20-14.\nTate connected again with Brodell to put Iowa back in the lead, 21-20. Brodell led the Hawks in offence with 6 receptions for 159 yards. \nIn the fourth quarter, Selvin Young capped a Texas drive by rushing 2 yards to make it 26-21, as the Longhorns failed to make the 2-point conversion. Iowa then marched downfield and Kyle Schlicher kicked a 38-yard field goal to pull Iowa within two points at 26-24 with 11 minutes left in the game. \nWith just a field goal needed and nearly five minutes to go, Iowa was given a gift when a short 19-yard punt put Iowa in possession near midfield. Iowa coach Kirk Fernetz then tried a bit of trickery which doomed Iowa's hopes. Texas safety Marcus Griffin tackled Dominique Douglas for a 9-yard loss on a reverse wide-receiver pass on first down. Iowa could not convert and had to punt three plays later, and Texas successfully ran out the clock to win the game.\nCoach Ferentz immediately claimed the blame for the risky play call. \"It's totally my fault.

It nudged the president toward a policy of negotiations with countries like Iran and Syria, previously seen as enemies, and eventual withdrawal.\nBush met with advisers during December to decide how to proceed in Iraq. Before taking a vacation in , Tex., his spokesman said the announcement of a new strategy would come sometime after the New Year. Some have speculated that meant he would include in his State of the Union address to Congress expected later this month.\nHowever, the timing of a speech this week may be pointed toward Capitol Hill anyway, as Democrats said they plan to largely sideline Bush's Republican party from the first 100 hours of lawmaking as the new legislature convenes."}

In 2005 the number of organs donated equalled 29, a previous record low in New Zealand.\nBefore 2005 the number of organ donations averaged 40, an already low number by international standards.\nAndy Tookey, campaigner for GiveLife New Zealand, said: \"It is important not to lose donors through families overriding donors' wishes or the doctors not asking families in the first place.\" In the Intensive Care Units an audit showed that there was a possibility of 104 donors and only 69 of those families were asked if the organs could be donated. And 31 families refused to donate the organs.\nGiveLife suggested that the main reason for the lack of donors could be the low road toll and the better healthcare.\nDoctor Jackie Blue, National member of Parliament, and Mr Tookey have together proposed a change to the current law, in opposition to the latest change in the law proposed by the government, which he claims will give more power to help reverse the decline in organ donations. Mr Tookey said that the government's proposal bestows power upon others to \"veto your wish to be a donor.\"\nMr Tookey said: \"With doctors not asking families and other families saying no, we need to give the power back to the individual. What is the point of someone specifying they want to be a donor if it means nothing and can be overridden by everyone else? Why are doctors asking for a second consent when they have a perfectly legal one already from the person concerned, who made the decision whilst in sound and calm mind and then they are replacing it with a decision made by others made at a fraught and distressing time?\"\nIn world league tables of organ donations, New Zealand currently stands between Iceland and Mexico for the numbers of organs donated.

The disabled girl was operated upon at the request of her parents, to prevent her from growing, menstruating and developing breasts. The parents, who wish to remain anonymous, explain their situation on a blog entitled The \"Ashley Treatment\". There have been over 1000 reactions on the blog so far.\nAshley suffers a condition termed \"static encephalopathy with marked global developmental deficits of unknown etiology\", which means brain damage of unknown cause leading to a kind of static condition. She can make sounds, move her arms and kick her legs, but she cannot change her position, eat, walk, talk etc. Many of these children are in poor health and die young, but Ashley is in good health. For all of these functions she depends on her caregivers. Most of the day she passes watching her surrounding, lying on a pillow. Her parents call her their \"Pillow Angel\", \"since she is so sweet and stays right where we place her\u2014usually on a pillow.\"\nAshley's parents want to keep her at home and care for her themselves, and they want to guarantee their daughter's quality of life. To this end, they say, Ashley underwent several surgical procedures and medical treatments during a period of three years. To attenuate her growth, Ashley was given high doses of the hormone estrogen. Ashley now measures 4ft 5 (1m 35cm) and weighs around 75 lbs (34 kg), which is below her expected length and weight. Her low body weight and size would improve her comfort, and at the same time facilitate the work of her caregivers.\nSurgery to remove her uterus (a procedure called a hysterectomy) and breast buds were performed, so Ashley does not menstruate and will not develop breasts, both of which parents think only would cause her discomfort. Since high estrogen levels can cause menstrual bleeding and breast development, the surgery was also meant to limit these effects. She also underwent surgery to remove her appendix, because it would be difficult to diagnose appendicitis given Ashley's low communication possibilities.\nThe case report.\nDr. Gunther, an endocrinologist, and Dr. Diekema, a pediatrician ethicist, from the Department of Pediatrics, Children's Hospital and Regional Medical Center in Seattle published a case report on her treatment in the October 2006 issue of the medical journal Archives of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine. They suggest that \"after proper screening and informed consent, growth-attenuation therapy should be a therapeutic option available to these children should their parents request it\". In the paper, they refer to the American Academy of Pediatrics, which holds the belief that \"most parents desire to raise their children with special health care needs at home\", and \"that all children, regardless of the presence of a disability, belong in families.\" Ashley's parents were quoted to fear that without an intervention, their daughter would be \"put in the hands of strangers.\"\nAshley has two siblings, and the medical report notes that \"Despite her severe disability, she clearly is an integral, and much loved, member of the family.\" The treatment was approved by a local multidisciplinary ethical committee consisting of 40 members. The committee noted that \"although justified in this patient, growth attenuation should be considered in future patients only after careful evaluation of the risks and benefits on a case-by-case basis.\" \nIn the case report discussion, the physicians recognize that surgical removal of the uterus in disabled girls \"is controversial and invariably associated with the negative connotations and history of forced 'sterilization.'\" Indeed, some reactions on the internet accused the parents of practices bordering eugenics and \"perversity\". The hysterectomy eliminates the need for contraceptive hormone treatment in a population with \"no realistic reproductive aspirations\". Estrogens carry a theoretical risk for thrombosis, but the clinical importance in this setting remains unknown. There seems to be a risk of seizures in a population with a predilection for epilepsy.\nIn their paper, the authors also discuss the fact that Ashley's small stature could cause caregivers to continue treating her like a nine-year-old, even if she becomes older. But they do not believe that such \"infantilization\" will harm the child, because they believe her intellectual capacities are at about the same level, so such an approach may be in fact appropriate.\nIn an editorial by Dr. Brosco, Department of Pediatrics, University of Miami, he discusses the fact that there is no evidence to support the hypothesis that keeping a disabled person small allows them to be cared for at home for a longer period. He rejects the argument of interfering with nature too much, since it is not uncommon practice to treat girls who grow taller than what is normally accepted with estrogens. He argues that a small gesture alone might induce some intuitive ethical concern, but that shouldn't stop us \"if we truly believe that the worth of a person goes deeper than his or her physical appearance.\"\nDr. Brosco also draws attention to a broader social context, indicating that the burden for the family is higher in a society that fails to provide adequate support. He notes that when the child enters the adult medical and social system, parents tend to get less access to often expensive care aids and devices. \"As a society, we do a pretty rotten job of helping caregivers provide what's necessary for these patients,\" was the comment of another medical ethicist, Dr. Joel Frader of Chicago's Children's Memorial Hospital.\nIn bioethical issues, where benefits and risks are weighed, \"do no harm\" is one of the governing principle for doctors, who swear it in the Hippocratic oath. Arthur Caplan, a biomedical ethicist at the University of Pennsylvania told Reuters that \"Puberty, growth (and) aging happen to all of us and there are plenty of people out there who will require help from family or society... The solution isn't to take every person who is schizophrenic or autistic or behaviorally disoriented and keep them in a child-like state.\" He further warns of the slippery slope implications this kind of thinking might have."}

With the decreased levels of oxygen, the eelpouts are literally gasping for air and causing the number of eelpouts to decrease.\n\"When you say I get less oxygen in, then I have less oxygen available for aerobic energy and I have less energy for the diverse tasks that a species needs to fulfill in an ecosystem, such as being ready to prey, grow, move and reproduce.

He founded Nissin in the year 1948 from a humble family operation. Japan faced food shortages during the post-World War II period and Ando thought a quality, convenient noodle product would help feed the masses. He brought out the Chicken Ramen, the first noodle product in the year 1958. The chicken-flavored dried noodle cake could be served in minutes by pouring hot water over it in a bowl. He started exporting it to the US during 1970.\nThe Cup Noodle concept was born in 1971. Ando said, he was inspired when he saw people lining up to buy bowls of hot ramen soup at a black market stall during this period. Its taste and ease of preparation made it one of the most favorite food in the world. The Chicken Ramen product had been a hit, and the despite a hefty tag of 35 Yen, he unleashed the product \u2013 Cup Noodles, on the market. \nNissin has been the undisputed leader of the noodle industry since then, selling a 85.7 billion servings every year, according to Agence France Presse.\n\"The Momofuku Ando Instant Ramen Museum\" opened in 1999 in Ikeda City in western Japan housing his various inventions. \nHis firm also developed a version of Cup Noodles for Japanese astronauts to eat on Space Shuttle Discovery. \"It is like a dream that people from rivaling countries can eat Ramen together in space,\" were Ando's words to the reporters at that time.

It shows little before or after the punch, a total of only four seconds. \nJean Erik Redrupp, General Manager of Park Operations, stated to Local 6 that \"I just wanted to follow up with you and let you know that we have spoken to the cast member in question and have reacted very strongly toward him.\"\nMonaco Sr. told the station that \"The general manager apologized to me. Everybody will come up and apologize to me but Tigger. He won't be a man about it and get out of the costume and come out and apologize to my son. I didn't want VIP treatment. I didn't want an extra day at Disney. I didn't want any of that. I wanted him to apologize and that is the one thing that they won't do.\" In the statement, he did not clarify whom \"everybody\" was.\nBoth Disney and the Orange County Sheriff's Office launched investigations on Saturday. Fedelem has been suspended by the company until the investigation is complete. Disney commented in a statement to CBS News that: \"We received the complaint alleging that a character struck a guest; guest and character altercation is not tolerated. The Orange County sheriff is launching an investigation and we are conducting our own investigation and we have suspended the cast member pending the outcome.\"\nMonaco Sr. took his son to the hospital the night after the altercation. Monaco Jr. claimed that he had neck pains. \"I'm a little sore and most of the pain is gone because I have medicine,\" he told the CBS Early Show today.\nIn footage, Monaco has no visible bruising.\nThe videotape was in regular rotation on news stations on Sunday and Monday. As of 4:00 pm ET 8 January 2007, Google News listed over five hundred news outlets filing stories on the incident.\nPooh once subject of similar attention.\nA 1981 case tried Winnie the Pooh, a character from the same series of cartoons as Tigger, was viciously slapped. The incident, which happened three years prior, was alleged to have resulted in bruising, recurring headaches, and possible brain damage.\nCostumed character actor Robert Hill was the first witness in the case. He testified that the costume severely restricted his vision and movement. He recalled that the girl was tugging at his costume from behind. Turning to see who it was, he accidentally struck her ear.\nThe Disney attorney reentered the courtroom in costume, with Hill in costume. Hill responded to questions while on the witness stand. Pooh was asked \"What do you do at Disneyland?\" Hill danced down the courtroom aisle, causing the audience to burst into laughter. The judge stated, \"Have the record show that he's doing a two-step.\" The comical procedure demonstrated the arms on the elaborate costume were too low to the ground to slap the girl at her then height.\nAfter 21 minutes, defendant Robert Hill was acquitted on all charges.\nSimilarly in 1976, a women filed a lawsuit claiming one of the Three Little Pigs ran up to her at the \"It's a Small World\" attraction, grabbing at and fondling her, it supposedly exclaimed \"Mommy! Mommy!\" As a result, she claimed to have gained 50 pounds, seeking $150,000 in damages for assault and battery, false imprisonment, and humiliation.\nThe plaintiff dropped charges after Disney's laywers presented her with a photo of the costume, which had only stubs, not operable arms.\nPrevious Tigger accused, acquitted.\nAnother Tigger performer, Michael C. Chartrand, was prosecuted on criminal charges. A 13-year-old girl and her mother both claimed he fondled their breast while posing for a photo, while visiting the Magic Kingdom on 21 February 2004. Arrested in April, Chartrand was charged with lewd and lascivious molestation of a child and simple battery. Twenty-four more complaints were logged with authorities in the following week, however each lacked sufficient evidence to press charges.\nA plea bargain found him not guilty after Mr. Chartrand's attorney, Jeffrey Kaufman, donned a Tigger costume to demonstrate its limited visibility and maneuverability to the jurors. He was allowed to return to his job by August.\nThe same actor was later suspended after \"shoving\" a male and a female Kodak photographer in the chest as Goofy. His lawyer from the previous case felt this was just part of the act, and not unnormal. He also stated to his client that as a tall character actor at a Disney Park immediately following the court case, \"he would be a walking bull's-eye\" for such accusations."}

The breaches includes all levels: level one, level two, level three and scholarships.\nDuring the external exams, the supervisors have to report all breaches of the rules. Those breaches are then given a punishment, which includes a written warning, exam results from a subject being withheld, all exam results being withheld for a year or banning the student from sitting any external exams the next year which has only ever happened once. The student was banned for constant breaches of the rules and constant disruptions in numerous exams. If a student causes disruption to other students during the exam, that student can expect harsh penalties as New Zealand Qualifications Authority say they consider a disruption very seriously.\nIn the first year of NCEA, 2004, a total of 129,853 students took part in external exams and of those, 186 breaches were filed by supervisors. 89 of those students had some subject results withheld. And, bringing the total to 90, one student had all results withheld and was prevented from sitting exams the next year.\nIn 2004 \"Accessing Information or Materials\" rules included, bringing in own paper which happened 13 times; using an electronic translator, 17 times; using a mobile phone, 18 times; bringing in notes, 41 times; using book(s), once. Rules relating to \"Influencing/Assisting or Hindering\" are, disturbing or communicating with other students, which happened 11 times and 26 times respectively. \"Not following Instructions\" rules are, drawing or writing rude notes on the answer paper, happened 20 times; continuing to write after exam has finished, eight times; listening to a music player, four times; prematurely starting the exam, four times; refusing to stay under supervision, two times; cheating (includes attempts to), 12 times; altering an answer booklet then getting it reconsidered, once. An Information Management external exam had to be held over several sessions due to low resources. All students were required to remain in a secure environment for 30 minutes after the exam following theirs had started, two did not which was considered a breach of the rules. And seven peoples' submitted portfolios had authenticity issues.\n\"Forms of Misconduct\" was changed in 2005, so the definitions have slightly changed.\nOut of 132,241 students sitting exams, 208 of them broke the external exam rules.\n95 of those students had some of their results withheld and only one person had all of his exam results withheld, for a year. The other students, 112, received written warnings.\n89 students were investigated for \"Accessing Information or Materials\"; 13 for having a cellphone with them; 40 for having notes in the exam; 13 for copying, or attempting to copy, other students work and four were investigated for altering their answer booklet and then having it reconsidered. 70 students were investigated for \"Not following Instructions\"; 47 for writing rude messages on the answer booklet and/or drawing rude pictures. 14 students were investigated for \"Influencing/Assisting or Hindering\". 29 students were investigated for \"Performance Based Authenticity\", which is where a group of students work looks very similar to the other.\nOnly one student was investigated for \"Impersonating another candidate\"."}

{"id": "58151", "revid": "4460", "url": "https://en.wikinews.org/wiki?curid=58151", "title": "Prince Laurent of Belgium testifies in marine fraud case", "text": "Prince Laurent of Belgium, the youngest son of King Albert II of Belgium, has been questioned last night by the federal police and is attending today's court session in Hasselt in a marine fraud case that has gripped Belgian media since last December. He arrived in a Smart car and was accompanied by his lawyer and former politician Fred Erdman. The case turns around funds of the Belgian Navy that have been used to beautify the Prince's villa in Tervuren. The Prince is expected to testify this afternoon.\nIn total, \u20ac 2.2 million was supposedly diverted from the marine's purchasing services using false invoices. Roughly \u20ac 185 000 was allegedly used to paint the Prince's villa, install lights in the garden, for the purchase of carpet and furniture, and for his secretariat and for animal clinics the Prince supports via his Foundation. Twelve marine officers and contractors are being accused of document fraud, collusion, bribery, embezzlement of government money \"etc\". and could face 10 years in prison. The money was part of the budget that wasn't spent at the end of the year, and which would flow back to the government if the army didn't spend it.\nThe Prince, who is also an officer in the navy, is being treated only as a witness in this case, there have been no charges against him. The Attorney General in Hasselt Marc Rubens has said that there are no elements in the investigation that point to the fact that Laurent was aware of the affair, however several accused have contested this in the press. Technically, the villa is not the property of the Prince himself, but of the Royal Gift, which manages the real property of the Royal Family.\nDuring his interview by the police last night, Prince Laurent stated that he needed funds to renovate his villa, and that No\u00ebl Vaessen, his adviser, told him the Navy could help him. The Prince stated that he thought it was legal, and that he had no reason to doubt his adviser.\nEx-Colonel No\u00ebl Vaessen was an adviser of the Prince between 1993 and 1999. Vaessen has declared in the media during the last month that the Prince actively participated in the fraud, and that he fears a cover-up. He said that the Prince was a demanding party in the operation, and that \"he knew that we were arranging things to make his life and his work as comfortable as possible.\" According to Vaessen, the Prince was in need of money to support a royal lifestyle, and \"didn't even have enough money to buy food.\"\nIn 2001, Vaessen was discharged with honour from the army \"for medical reasons\", but Defence Minister Andr\u00e9 Flahaut is investigating if there was no agreement to give him his pension in exchange for the fact that he wouldn't incriminate the Prince. Vaessen also accused the Prince of other things, such as racing against the high-speed train TGV on a French highway. He has also incriminated Admiral Herteleer. Captain Johan Claeys, one of the accused, studied with the Prince and worked at the facturation services of the Navy in 1998 and 1999. One of the accused contractors, Marc Luypaerts, has told the press that the judge responsible for the investigation in Hasselt had forbidden him to speak about Prince Laurent.\nLaurent's status as a Prince has several judicial consequences for the trial. In Belgium, it's against the law to incriminate the Royal Family during a trial. Also, the Prince is protected from judicial pursuit because he is also a Senator by law. Justice Minister Laurette Onkelinx has issued a Royal Decrete, which the King has signed while on holiday in Napels, which would make it possible for Princes to testify in a trial.\nHowever, Public Prosecutor Erwin Steyls has chosen to have Laurent interrogated by the police last night in Hasselt. This was the first time during the last six years of the inquiry that the Prince was questioned. Today in the court, the Prosecutor defended the act of having him questioned outside the trial, saying that there were several procedural issues. First, the subpoena for the Prince wasn't issued in time to be legal. Second, the details of the protocol to hear the Prince in court were not explained in the recent Royal Decrete, making it worthless -something Minister Onkelickx denied. Thirdly, nobody can be forced to testify against himself, and if the Prince were to make false statements under oath, he could only be sued for perjury. However, the court has decided to let him testify anyway this afternoon.\nDuring the last month, the case has caused a several spin-off discussions in Belgium. One of the surprises during this period was the King's Christmas Message, in which he referred to the case. The regional governments are now investigating and discussing their donations to the IRGT/KINT, an environmental organisation supported by Prince Laurent. But there is also an ongoing debate over the position of the Monarchy in Belgium. Some politicians are suggesting to limit the role of the Monarchy, and other think that only the King and Queen, the Crown Prince or Princess and the widow(er) of the King or Queen should receive state funding.

Fedelem as Tigger, hitting teen Jerry Monaco Jr. in the head. The New Hampshire tourist and his father both claim the hit was unprovoked. They claimed Jerry Jr. needed medical attention and prescription medicine that night. In contrast, most Internet pundits critical of the video have suggested that the hit was relatively weak. Fedelem himself claims the swat was indeed provoked, after the Monaco Jr was pulling on his costume, trying to suffocate him.\nThe Teamsters Union Local 385 website appears to suggest that not all character cast members are unionized. Fedelem is known to be unionized, as he is mentioned on the website regarding a separate matter.\nHit becomes punchline.\nTim MacDonald of The News and Tribune joked that, \"in addition to her Majority Whip\", new US Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi \"might want to consider hiring the DisneyWorld employee in the Tigger costume to keep her Democrats in line.\"\nMeanwhile, a British columnist riffed on how Tigger let the boy off lightly. Brian Reade commented \"most Brits feel that, simply on the grounds he's called Junior, it's a shame the guy in the Tigger costume wasn't called Charles Manson.\"\nA columnist suggested that \"Tigger does more parenting before 9 a.m. than some parents do their entire lives\", in an article advocating discipline.

Premature babies are usually encouraged to get them, especially the sextuplets born on Sunday, which weigh 700 to 800 grams.\nThe parents are Jehovah's Witnesses, a faith that has a doctrine against blood transfusions. (Officially, the church holds that blood transfusions consisting of blood products, rather than whole blood, may be accepted by Witnesses in some circumstances as a matter of individual conscience; however, de facto all blood transfusions are forbidden to Witnesses. Many people who are a part of the faith create an Advance Medical Directive card ordering that no blood transfusions be given under any circumstances.)\n\"Non-blood treatment is way superior in every situation and many doctors in hospitals worldwide are calling it the gold standard,\" said Mark Ruge, director of public information at the Canadian headquarters for Jehovah's Witnesses, from his office in Georgetown, Ontario. \"Even for young children and babies, there are alternatives \u2013 no (blood) transfusion doesn't mean you're going to die.\"\n\"To have blood is not the superior way, even though the little jingles on TV say blood gives life...Parents want the best for their children and so do we; we consider life very precious,\" said Ruge. \"We love our children dearly; we're very family oriented... but there can be a public misperception.\"\nPeter Cech, a spokesperson for B.C.

Travelling from , into northern Alberta and Edmonton, Alberta region, through and to , a severe started the night of Tuesday January 9, 2007. By Wednesday January 10, 2007, the storm tracked from Alberta and hit Saskatchewan. According to weather announcements on the Weather Network the blizzard is expected to abate in Saskatchewan by 9:00 pm Central Standard Time. At the height of the storm, gusting winds approached upwards of 80 miles per hour. The temperature began in the morning around -10 Celsius, dropping to -21 Celsius by the evening. \nBlowing snow conditions reduced visabliity to less than a car length at times. Some drivers who dared venture out on the highway told of needing to leave their car to kick away snow on the ground in order to determine if they were still driving on pavement. Heroic citizens donned ski pants and parkas, and thus bundled against the elements, assisted drivers who were unable to navigate the black ice covered by the fresh snow at the top of the . In this way their efforts relieved an already bad condition of the piled up congestion on this bridge. Early in the afternoon, the new was closed, and traffic was ill advised to use Circle Drive, which was battered by drifting snow drifts and gusting winds coming in from the open countryside. Around noon, it was said that taxi companies ceased to operate. A typical 15 minute venture driving across the City of Saskatoon mounted into line ups of 1 to two hours as traffic slowed to a snail's pace, due to stuck vehicles, accidents, tow trucks, emergency vehicles, and vehicles unable to navigate steep hills and the underlying black ice from previous winter conditions. Highways, public schools and school bus routes were among the first to be closed. Shopping malls, universities, colleges and high schools soon followed. Any children who arrived at school in early morning were kept at the school until parents could pick them up. Pedestrians were virtually impossible for vehicular traffic to see, and drifting snow made sidewalks hard to navigate. According to media sources, some children may be stranded overnight at schools in cases where roads are totally impassable due to white out conditions. By 6:00 pm City transit buses were not running, Saskatchewan transit buses would not take on highway travel and the airport closed down. Any travellers were strongly urged to book into hotel rooms by 3:00 pm as many hotels were near capacity by mid afternoon. Attempts to use cell phones were often greeted with a busy signal, as the network was loaded with calls during the emergency period. At 3:00 pm any calls for ambulances were encouraged to be of necessity only, and even then a 20 minute wait for the arrival of an ambulance was foreseeable according to radio announcements. As of 7:00 pm, police were only responding to crimes in progress and emergency situations. Tow trucks and were having a difficult time responding to situations. Residents were strongly urged to stay at home.\nSGEU Snowplow operators strike overview.\nTo make matters more complicated highway workers supported the Saskatchewan Government Employees Union, (SGEU) which had been on strike since December 20, 2006. Correctional workers, and environmental employees who were on strike were joined by snowplow operators and supervisors Sunday, January 7, 2007. By the end of Sunday approximately 1,200 highway workers were on a rotating strike, and had walked off the job. \nOn Tuesday, January 9, 2007, in the face of weather predictions, SGEU advised highway workers to return to work. By Wednesday, January 10, 2007, the brunt of the storm was faced by a full contingent of snowplow workers.\nEnvironment Canada Blizzard Warning.\nA Blizzard warning from environment Canada reported zero to almost zero visibility in Saskatchewan. The area around announced closures first. Many highways closed between north western centrally located , and as far south and east as , and everywhere in between. Highways out of the cities were barricaded. Police and media were advising any and all travel be delayed till the conditions abate. Snow is drifting and the strong winds have made total snowfall hard to calculate.\nWeather shuts down Saskatchewan.\nAt 7:30 p.m. CST Martensville - Warman - Rosthern - Delisle - Wakaw-\nCity of Saskatoon. Blizzard warning in effect. Wind northeast 60 km/h gusting to 80 diminishing to 40 gusting to 60 then becoming north 20 near midnight. Low minus 27. Wind chill minus 38.\nWinter storm warning in effect for Southern Saskatchewan.\nPhotographs of the Storm.\nPictures of the January 10 Saskatchewan storm are online which were taken by CP Press photographer Geoff Howe. Sun Young walking to work, College Drive pedestrian, and three young samaritans who helped vehicles navigate the weather. \nAftermath.\nThe full effects of the blizzard have yet to be witnessed in news reports of Thursday January 11, 2007. Wednesday's announcements of leaving the home only if absolutely necessary, and blizzard warnings to eliminate highway travel hopefully have averted many disasters. As of Friday, January 12, three people in Saskatchewan had succumbed to the storm.\nIn Saskatchewan it has been reported on January 11, 2007 that three persons have lost their lives due to the blizzard. All had left their vehicles and fell short by meters of shelter from the elements. \nDue to traffic snarls and tie ups emergency rescue personnel used snowmobiles to search out stranded vehicles and investigate for persons within. Several weary travellers were indeed found in this way. Due to drastic cold weather, vehicles failing to start, and homes being snowed in, school was cancelled the day following the blizzard, as wind chill dropped to -47 Celsius. Tow trucks were busy all day Thursday, and a special phone number was available for city residents who had abandoned their vehicles in the storm. To clear the streets, tow trucks would take vehicles to empty parking lots till claimed. \nIn Saskatchewan to attain \"blizzard\" status, a storm must last at least 4 hours. Wednesday's storm delivered approximately 7 hours of zero visibility. This storm severe as it was pales in comparison to the February 1947 blizzard which raged for 10 days burying trains, and the 4 day long blizzard of February 1978 which deposited snow up to the eavestrough of homes. The storm has been dubbed an Alberta Clipper storm as it had its origins in the Rocky Mountains in western Canada racing south and westerly across Alberta and the prairies towards the Appalachains and north eastern USA as well as Eastern Canada. Frigidly cold weather follows the low pressure front of the Alberta Clipper storm. "}

Pentagon spokesman Bryan Whitman told Agence France-Presse that the building raided was \"not a consulate or a government building\", which appears to be confirmed by the Iraqi foreign minister, Hoshyar Zebari, who said the Iranians were working at an office that had government approval and was in the process of being approved as a consulate, but was not a Consulate nor the Iranian Consulate General. The US is strategically insisting that they raided a \"liaison office\" instead of a Consulate to avoid being found in violation of Article 36 of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations.\nRussian Ministry of Foreign Affairs Mikhail Kamynin said that the raid was absolutely unacceptable and was a violation of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations. The Kurdistan Regional Government also expressed their shock and disapproval of the raid.\nOn Thursday's hearing on Iraq, Senator Joseph Biden (D-Delware), chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, told Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice that the Bush Administration did not have the authority to send U.S. troops on cross-border raids. Biden said, \"I believe the present authorization granted the president to use force in Iraq does not cover that, and he does need congressional authority to do that. I just want to set that marker.\" After the meeting, Biden sent a follow-up letter to the White House asking for an explanation from the Bush Administration on the matter.\nOn Thursday morning, Iran's foreign ministry official sent a letter to Iraq's foreign ministry asking Iraq to stop the Bush Administration from interfering with Iraq-Iran relations, and has protested the raid on its liaison office. The official said, \"We expect the Iraqi government to take immediate measures to set the aforesaid individuals free and to condemn the U.S. troopers for the measure. Following up on the case and releasing the arrestees is a responsibility of primarily the Iraqi government and then the local government and officials of the Iraqi Kurdistan.\""}

The hearing was a planned follow-up by the administration to answer concerns raised by President Bush's address to the nation on Wednesday where he announced the commitment to send more troops to Iraq. Biden asked several questions about whether the president had plans to send troops across the borders of Iran and Syria.\n\"Does that mean the president has plans to cross the Syrian and/or Iranian border to pursue those persons or individuals or governments providing that help?\" Biden asked.\nIn an extensive answer, the secretary did not seem to explicitly deny it: \"...What we're really trying to do here which is to protect our forces and that we are doing that by seeking out these networks that we know are operating in Iraq. We are doing it through intelligence. We are then able, as we did on the 21st of December, to go after these groups where we find them. In that case, we then asked the Iraqi government to declare them \"persona non grata\" and expel them from the country because they were holding diplomatic passports.\"\nShe soon added: \"...We do need to work with our allies to make certain that they have the defense capacity that they need against growing Iranian military build-up, that they feel that we are going to be a presence in the Persian Gulf region as we have been, and that we establish confidence with the states with which we have long alliances, that we will help defend their interests. And that's what the president had in mind.\"\n\"The Plank\" was quick to note that the \"secret war\" was, at this point, just a rumor. Later that day, \"The New York Times\" published a report on an interview conducted in Condoleezza Rice's office Friday afternoon, before she left for a trip to the Middle East. \"There has been a decision to go after these networks,\" she said, referring to President Bush. The U.S. military was authorized by the president to take action against Iranian operatives in Iraq months ago.\nIn the same report, the \"New York Times\" quoted the new secretary of defense Robert M. Gates as saying, \"We believe that we can interrupt these networks that are providing support, through actions inside the territory of Iraq, that there is no need to attack targets in Iran itself.\"\nThough he is Commander in Chief of the U.S. armed forces, the president does not have the constitutional authority to declare war (only the Congress does). The president, however, can order military strikes without declaring war.\nThe U.S. has long explored possible attacks on Iran, according to Seymour Hersh, who has written three articles on deteriorating US-Iran relations for the New Yorker magazine.\nThe US, acting through Turkey, has supported Israeli intelligence collection and propaganda broadcasts supporting the ethnic Azeri nationalist movement in the north of Iran, according to Scott Ritter, former UNSCOM weapons inspector in Iraq, since at least 1996.\nAnticipation of possible US military action against Iran has only intensified since Bush's midweek speech in which he announced 21,500 more soldiers would be sent to Iraq. In the same speech, he warned Iran and Syria against involvement in the Iraq conflict.\nHours after the speech, U.S. forces raided the Iranian Consulate in the town of Arbil, in the Kurdish area of Iraq, detaining several Iranian officials."}

The apparent influence of \"Saudi Arabian Islam\", sometimes known as Wahabism or Salafism, is also scrutinised in the film.\nProgramme makers claim the documentary, filmed and written by journalist Bobby Pathak, reveals \"a number of mosques run by high profile national organisations that claim to be dedicated to moderation and dialogue with other faiths\" but are in fact spreading \"a message of religious bigotry and extremism\". One of the Islamic organisations allegedly secretly filmed is Markazi Jamiat Ahl-e-Hadith, a registered British charity which runs more than 40 mosques and branches in the UK with its headquarters at Green Lane Mosque in the Small Heath area of the city.\nThe documentary largely focused on the views of Abu Usama at-Thahabi, an African-American preacher based at the Green Lane Mosque. The documentary purported to show evidence of speeches made by the imam in which he allegedly condemns women, homosexuals and non-Muslims. In one clip, he is heard to say: \"Allah has created the woman - even if she gets a PhD - deficient. Her intellect is incomplete, deficient. She may be suffering from hormones that will make her emotional. It takes two witnesses of a woman to equal the one witness of the man.\"\nHowever, the Medinah University educated convert to Islam claimed his words had been misconstrued, later releasing a Google internet video defending his words.\nHowever, the Anglo-Muslim group, founded in the 1970s, has rebuked the allegations, describing the documentary as \"grossly distorted\". Shaykh Shouaib Ahmed, the Secretary General of Markazi Jamiat Ahl-e-Hadith voiced his concerns.\n\"We reject all forms of extremism. It is deeply alarming that a few sentences have been taken out of context in order to create the impression that our institution is a hotbed of fanaticism they could have approached us directly - we operate an open door policy in our mosques. We have nothing to hide. The religion of Islam is very clear.\"\nThe mosque explained, \"We would like to make it clear that Markazi Jamiat Ahl-e-Hadith cannot be regarded as endorsing every word uttered by every speaker we invite to our various mosques. Islam commands us to respond in kind to those who desire peaceful co-existence. If anyone contradicts this teaching then we would repudiate their views without hesitation.\"\nA similar opinion was echoed in a statement from the Saltley Gate Peace Group. The community action project, based at the Saltley Methodist Church, feared the community around the mosque would be ostracized as a result of the investigation. \"We cannot speak for the views of specific individuals featured in the film but are completely in support of the good nature of the mosque's diverse, multiracial and peaceful worshippers and administration.\"\nThe group has in the past successfully campaigned against propaganda campaigns in the area led by the disbanded radical group, Al-Muhajiroun.\n\"It is our hope that more resources will be spent on preventing true radical groups from brainwashing young Muslims and less time spent on demonising the general Muslim population for the actions of a select few\", they added.\nThe Markazi Jamiat Ahl-e-Hadith and Green Lane Masjid felt the forthcoming edition of \"Dispatches\" would \"play into the hands of those who wish to exacerbate tensions within society\". The religious authority has sent a letter to producer of the programme, Andrew Smith, highlighting their concerns.\nAn Ahl-e-Hadith mosque in Derby was also put under the spotlight in the programme, along with a Birmingham mosque run by the UK Islamic Mission (UKIM)."}

Autopsies by toxicologists from the WA Department of Agriculture will test for organochlorins, organophosphates and heavy metals. \nEsperance residents first noticed large numbers of dead birds littering their streets and gardens on December 7 last year. Populations of honeyeaters, wattle birds and miners have reportedly been effected. \nThe birds were being found vomiting and convulsing in bushland and suburban backyards over an extensive area. Department of Environment and Conservation's (DEC) nature conservation coordinator Mike Fitzgerald says toxic wetlands near Esperance are the most likely reason for the mass bird deaths. \nThe DEC says it has failed to figure out the cause of death despite interviewing industry groups, farmers, grain handlers and timber companies about pesticide and chemical use.\nBirds Australia, the peak group dedicated to the conservation, study and enjoyment of Australia's native birds and their habitats, said it had not heard of a similar occurrence. \"Not on that scale, and all at the same time, and also the fact that it's several different species,\" chief executive Graeme Hamilton told the Sunday Times. \"You'd have to call that a most unusual event and one that we'd all have to be concerned about.\"\nMike Fitzgerald said the DEC were looking at something \"pretty potent.\" \"This is not a normal situation. The common thing that we have seen and heard is that the affected birds have an insatiable thirst... If it turns out to be a toxin that is responsible, that will raise more questions because there is no obvious source of exposure.\"\nThe deaths could be a result of a drier than normal winter, causing algal and bacterial blooms in the Esperance Lakes Nature Reserves. Esperance recorded 457mm rainfall in 2006; the average is 620mm.\nInitially, health authorities feared a virus, such as the deadly avian bird flu, was responsible. That was quickly ruled out, along with poisoning from bacteria or eating poisoned insects.\nThe first deaths were reported by Esperance resident Michelle Crisp - who lives close to the worst-affected area. Dozens of native birds began dying in her back yard a week before Christmas. She says she contacted neighbours to discover if they were experiencing the same thing. Mrs Crisp found four dead birds, then 16, then 30 and finally up to 80.\nMike Fitzgerald said that any one of hundreds of toxins could be causing the deaths but so far all leads had not produced any answers."}

The competitions are shown during advertisements on New Zealand television stations, and include possible prizes of televisions, game consoles, exercise equipment, and more.\nThe Commerce Commission said that they have received around 180 complaints regarding the text competitions and the charges they incur on their mobile phones. The charges are when a person texts the correct answer to 8555 they are agreeing to sign up to their subscription based services which charges them NZ$3 for each text message received. A maximum of $15 is charged a month unless the special keyword to stop receiving text messages: STOP is texted. The Commerce Commission said that the complaints reflect that the entrants do not know about the subscription, even though the advertisements briefly state in fine print that the competition is a subscription competition, how much a received text costs, etc at the bottom of the ad. \nAn employee of TMG Asia Pacific Pty Limited questioned about the subscription charges claimed that the majority of the charge for each text message sent to competition entrants goes to Telecom New Zealand, and a fraction is paid to them.\nThe director of Fair Trading for the Commerce Commission, Deborah Battell, said: \"[180 complaints] is an exceptionally high number of complaints for a single issue.\"\n\"The Commerce Commission is investigating whether the disclosure of the terms and conditions of these promotions was adequate,\" Ms Battell said.\nIn November of 2006 the Commerce Commission had contacted TMG Asia Pacific to discuss their concerns over their promotions.

A group of people has launched a campaign to collect money via the Internet to acquire a former British sea platform situated in the North Sea, six miles (9.6 kilometers) off the British coast.\nThe Pirate Bay states that the platform, named \"Sealand\", will give users an easy way of sharing files protected by copyright in other nations. According to the statement made on the website, those who invest in purchasing Sealand will receive citizenship in it. \nThe platform was occupied in 1967 by the associates and family members of Paddy Roy Bates, a former radio broadcaster and former British Army Major, who now form its royal family. Prince Roy and Princess Joan Bates and their son Prince Regent Michael are willing to sell the platform for \u00a365m. The royal family claims that it is independent and outside of any country's jurisdiction. \nThe sovereign status of the platform is disputed. The Government of the United Kingdom extended the territorial waters from 3 to 12 nautical miles after 1987, placing Sealand in its jurisdiction. However, Prince Roy simultaneously expanded the territory of Sealand and claimed continued independence. (See Sealand on Wikipedia.)\nHired estate agents from Spain estimate the price of the floating island to be about 504 million pounds. The Swedish website mentioned that it was looking for alternatives to acquire Sealand. It also mentioned that if the \"Internet-pirate\" community is not able to buy Sealand, it will look for another small place to claim as its own.\nThe Pirate Bay website was closed for some time in May 2006 due to Swedish police raids. The site was later re-opened from the Netherlands before moving back to Sweden."}

His accent surprised a girl who recognized his North Korean identity and the saleswoman rejected his buying due to \"resulting UN security council penalty.\" The agent left the store and a white-coated fat man (a black market wine seller) and a black-coated man followed.\nThe agent checked in at a hotel and received 3 phone calls; one from his commander urging him forward on the mission, one from a whore offering \"special service\" (to whom the agent replied with \"Yes, I need, I need a bottle of XO!\"), and one from the fat man asking him to go to a disco bar for XO trading. He went to the bar and watched the fat man dancing to \"We Were Forced to Be Gangs\" (the music is Michael Jackson's \"Beat It\"). The fat man found the agent's money was fake (which the agent explained was because North Korea wanted to \"ease the pressure that the hostile West put on China for currency appreciation\") and a fight ensued. The fat man was defeated and said \"Your country is not based on honesty\" while the agent said in his mind, \"No honesty for your revisionist country.\"\nThe agent is about to cross the China-North Korea border and the black-coated man caught up and defeated him by breaking his \"Kim Jong Il medal\" (which is a devastating psychological strike to North Koreans). The black-coated man revealed himself to be George W. Bush and some Chinese bystanders questioned him on why he hung Saddam (\"One Saddam is down but a million Saddams will be up!\") and drove him away. The curious Chinese bystanders accidentally broke the agent's XO which resulted in another devastating episode. The white-coated fat man reappeared and said he saw the whole event and was impressed by the agent and gave away another bottle of XO to him.\nThe agent returned to North Korea and presented the XO to Kim Jong Il (on their way to Kim's residence their eyes were covered in order not to \"give the Americans a chance to pinpoint Kim's precise location\").

Gregory Clayman, the owner of the live-action company Video Secrets expressed confidence that in the nearest future sex industry would be selling images of couples making love live over the hotel's entertainment systems. \nAt the same time Anne Taulane, managing editor of Lodging magazine, said she doubted whether major hotel chains would be enthusiastic about this idea as she was convinced that on-demand sex video was more available to the mainstream than viewing live sex performers over hotel's entertainment system. \nThe panelists praised Mastercard and Visa programs which helped to reduce chargebacks or refusals to pay for ordered sex video and debated whether requiring a credit card would prevent minors from viewing sexually explicit materials in the Internet. As the result they came to the conclusion that the government must intervene to cope with these problems."}

She is identified as Rochom P'ngieng, who disappeared in 1988, when tending buffalos in a remote part of the jungles of north-eastern Cambodia.\nHer parents had given up all hope of finding her since it was so long ago that she disappeared. The father of the girl is convinced that the woman is his daughter based on a distinct scar on her back and facial features. Authorities have asked for a DNA test to confirm the girl's identity. Rochom P'ngieng would be 27 years old.\nThe woman speaks no comprehensible language and thus it is difficult to confirm what has happened to her. She was discovered when a villager noticed that food had disappeared from a lunchbox he had left nearby his home, so he decided to watch the area, discovering the naked woman when she came again for some rice, according to the chief of police, Mao San in Oyado. \"It is as if she's part human and part animal\", said Mao San. A group of villagers were called together to catch the woman. The woman has had a hard time adjusting to normal life.\n\"She is strange. She sleeps in the day and wakes in the night,\" said Mao San."}

The Perfume Shop has announced they will withdraw the perfume \"Shh...\" of Jade Goody, one of the contestants accused of bullying with a racist undertone. Motorcycle insurance company Bennetts unilaterally terminated its deal with former Miss England Danielle Lloyd to front an advertisement campaign.\nThe accusations centre around recent comments made by Jade Goody, Danielle Lloyd and Jo O'Meara (a former member of pop act S Club 7) about Bollywood actress Shilpa Shetty. The racism row was sparked by Jade's mother, who referred to Shilpa as \"the Indian\", instead of calling her by her name. She also asked Shilpa: \"Do you live in a house or a shack?\" There have been remarks over her accent, her alleged lack of hygiene when cooking, and reactions because she touched the food of housemates with her hands. Danielle Lloyd said: \"You don't know where those hands have been.\" Lloyd also commented to Goody about the Indian actress: \"She wants to be white\".\nWhen asked about the incident in the Diary Room, Shetty said \"...I don't feel there was any racial discrimination happening from Jade's end. I think there are a lot of insecurities from her end but it's definitely not racial.\"\nHertfordshire Police, the constabulary within which the Big Brother House falls, have received numerous formal complaints they will be investigating. Politicians, other celebrities, and fans spoke of their disgust as the UK media regulator Ofcom received a record number of complaints that rose tonight to 33,000. The Commission for Racial Equality is investigating if the footage was manipulated to deliberately imply racism.\nLabour Party MP Keith Vaz even proposed a motion in the House of Commons condemning the abuse. He said \"If this racist behaviour goes on, they [Jo O'Meara, Danielle Lloyd and Jade Goody] should be asked to leave\". Chancellor Gordon Brown, currently on tour in India, told reporters in Bangalore: \"I want to reassure people that what British people are proud of is our reputation for tolerance and fairness.\" Others believe this reflects a racist tendency in British our Western society in general. The newspaper Times of India ran the headline \"Big(ot) Brother bullies Shilpa\". \"What is happening in Big Brother is just holding the mirror to the western society. This is the real, discriminating face of the West.\", was the reaction of Bollywood film director Mahesh Bhatt. Ken Livingstone, the Mayor of London, accused Channel 4 of damaging the country's reputation.\nThe show was recently losing viewers, but as a result of the controversy, viewing rates are up for the program."}

The company gained the record-breaking $ 1 billion. The overall annual revenue of the company made up $ 7.1 billion in 2006, having boosted from $5.8 billion in 2005. The company's revenue growth is partially explained by the fact that the laptops produced by Apple are also found among the bestsellers. \nEven the Wall Street experts have not broadcasted such remarkable results for the Apple computer company. Apple's results were way ahead of market expectations. Its net profit has made up $1.14 per share, while Wall Street expected just 77 cents. \nDuring the first quarter of the financial year Apple Inc. sold more than 21 million iPod players and about 1.6 million computers - it implies the respective growth of 28% and 50% again compared to the previous year. As soon as the results were announced at the New York Stock Exchange, the shares of the American computer company increased by 5 percent. \nIt should be mentioned that the stock capital of Apple Inc tripled in 2004, doubled in 2005 and increased by 16 percent in 2006.

If you enter \"Chicago\" for example, it shows no Wikipedia articles at all, and clicking \"Chicago, Illinois\" leads to an article on West Chicago, Illinois and other related articles to the subject. Similarly, entering \"Christmas\", \"United States\" or \"PlayStation 3\" only provides links to related articles on Wikipedia, although they are in the top 10 of most viewed articles in the English Wikipedia.

He pointed out that they welcome feedback more than the average search engine, which can be posted on their company wiki.\nSearchme put a button on their main page, encouraging beta testers to instantly promote the site on Digg. In August 2006, Digg had half a million registered users.\nSome media outlets have reported that Wikiseek was created by either the Wikimedia Foundation which runs Wikipedia, or private corporation Wikia, which hosts a collection of wiki communities.

Among the speakers present were those closely related to the publishing business - authors, publishers and analysts, including Cory Doctorow, a science fiction writer and co-editor of Boing Boing, as well as agents of the leading publishing stores such as Harper Collins and Cambridge University Press. \nHaving organized the event, Google pursued their aim of improving the perception of its Book Search project. The company tried to establish links with publishers and libraries by extending an offer whereby portions of copyrighted published content would be availabe for public view through the Google search database. Still, Google stumbled upon skeptical attitudes by publishers. \nHowever, some of the publishers supported the initiative. Cory Doctorow expressed his belief, grounded upon his personal experiences, that book snippets available free on the Internet implied the possibility of commercial benefit. One of the major advantages of the on-line library is the guaranteed attention and interest it can attract to the publishers' products.\nAlthough the issue aroused a lot of controversial opinions, the speakers came to the conclusion that as the digital world has been experiencing rapid growth, the publishing industry has to keep to the modern pace and broaden its horizons. As it was mentioned by Tim O'Reilly, the founder of O'Reilly Media, a technical manual publishing company, that in the time of revolutionary changes, brought by the development of digital technologies, it was important for their industry segment not to ignore but embrace the forthcoming changes. He also mentioned that the Library Project and Book Search tool carried out by Google represented an opportunity to become part of the newly-born media culture."}

Sri Lankan troops met little resistance as they moved into the town at around noon local time, as the Tamil Tigers were believed to have fled further North.\nA Sri Lankan defense ministry statement on its website said the LTTE had fled the town area \"unable to withstand the intrusive thrust of the armed forces\". A statement from the Media Center for National Security said \"triumphant troops are presently consolidating their positions and clearing the terrain to resettle displace civilians.\"\nThe Tigers have so far failed to comment on the fighting. \nLeading up to the capture of the town, around 12,000 civilians, whom the government claimed the LTTE were using as Human Shields, were reported to have fled to the safety of government controlled areas. This added to the 20,000 who had already fled to government controlled areas since heavy fighting began in December 2006.\nBasic necessities for them were provided by the security forces. The government stated that it would make all efforts to resettle the civilians as soon as normalcy is restored in the town.\nThe fall of Vakarai is expected to badly disrupt Tamil Tiger activities in the East, an also seriously dent their supplies to the North. \nLong-running conflict.\nThe LTTE has been fighting since 1983 to establish an independent state in the North and East of Sri Lanka. Its methods including the recruiting of child soldiers and suicide bombings have been widely criticized, and it is banned as a terrorist organization in a number of countries including the United States, the United Kingdom, India, Canada and the 27-member European Union. A ceasefire agreement was signed with intentional mediation in 2001, but broke down following a series of rebel attacks on government troops following the election of President Mahinda Rajapakse in November 2005.\nIn December, Sri Lankan Army commander Lt. Gen. Sarath Fonseka made clear that the objective of the military was to clear the East of the country of the rebels and then concentrate all efforts towards defeating them in the North."}

On January 19, 2007 Hovind was given ten years in federal prison, ordered to pay $640,000 in owed funds to the Internal Revenue Service, pay prosecution's court costs of $7,078, and serve three years parole once released. Originally in November, Hovind was ordered to forfeit $430,400 and faced a maximum of 288 years in prison.\nTrial.\nHovind, self-styled as \"Dr. Dino\" (whose Ph.D, from a non-accredited correspondence university, is in \"Christian education\") believes in Biblical literalism claimed that he is not liable for taxes and his \"ministry\" does not have to \"render unto Caesar\" because, as he claimed, his workers are \"missionaries\" not \"employees\". \nHovind's tax troubles date back to at least 1996, when a judge at Hovind's bankruptcy trial wrote, Hovind \"failed to acknowledge his obligations as a citizen and taxpayer of the United States, seeks to utilize this taxpayer supported court in order to thwart the lawful collection efforts of the Internal Revenue Service.\" The judge concluded, Hovind filed for bankruptcy in \"bad faith,\" and lied about his possessions and income.\nIn the April 2004 raid on his \"ministry\" business records were taken, and according to an IRS agent \"since 1997, Hovind has engaged in financial transactions indicating sources of income and has made deposits to bank accounts well in excess of $1 million per year during some of these years.\"\nDuring a IRS raid in Spring 2006, the government confiscated records, $42,000 in cash was seized, and that day Kent Hovind withdrew $70,000 from the Creation Science Evangelism account, half in a check; the other in cash.\nAt the November trial, the young Earth creationist chose not to present a defense case. While the prosecution noted Hovind never filed income taxes with the government, others testified Hovind claimed he had \"beat\" the tax system, and employees said Hovind's evangelism was a business not a ministry.\nHovind was found guilty in November 2006 by twelve jurors at the United States District Court for the Northern District of Florida in Pensacola. The charges included twelve counts of willful failure to collect, account for, and pay over Federal income taxes and under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7202, forty-five counts of knowingly structuring transactions in Federally-insured financial institutions to evade the reporting requirements of 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 5313(a), in violation of 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 5324, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2 and 31 C.F.R. sec. 103.11, and one count of corruptly endeavoring to obstruct and impede the administration of the internal revenue laws under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7212.\nSentencing.\nThe sentencing on Friday January 19, 2007 was a lengthy exchange that lasted 5 1/2 hours, and included statements from Hovind and his family members.\nDuring the sentencing a recording of telephone conversations Hovind made from jail was played in court. In those conversations Hovind said the Internal Revenue Service, presiding judge and prosecutor broke the law by going after him, and there were things he could do \"to make their lives miserable.\" In other recordings played Hovind was trying to hide assets from the government. One conversation with Eric Hovind, Kent Hovind's son, showed the two conspire to put assets in other peoples names and \"loan\" a motorhome with intent to have it returned. This was in violation of a court order, which allows property to be seized in restitution of owed money. In court, however, \"My father is not a man who is in love with money. He's in love with God,\" Eric told the judge.\nIn another jailhouse phone conversation Hovind spoke with an unidentified man, and he agreed with Hovind on hiding 10% of Hovind's merchandise and master DVDs from the government. Hovind then proposed a new shipping location out of the reach of the government to continue to sell merchandise despite a court order to pay debt or surrender his assets.\nMark O'Brien reported, \"Although phones include warnings that conversations are recorded, he didn't mince words as he ran up eight hours of calls per week.\" \nOn January 20, 2007 thirty minutes of phone calls prosecutors introduced \"as evidence Hovind was attempting to conceal assets and had not accepted responsibility for his actions\" were released online by the Pensacola News Journal.\nDuring the sentencing Hovind proclaimed to the judge, \"I am not a tax protester and never have been.\" He added, \"The laws are just fine. It is just that some are enforcing laws that are not there.\"\nReporter O'Brien commented, \"Hovind's talk sounds good to the courtroom full of sympathetic spectators,\" but it \"isn't factual.\" Furthermore, O'Brien wrote \"Today being Sunday, ask your minister or priest if he or she pays income taxes, just as the government requires,\" and \"You would think that Hovind, who claims a doctorate, would have figured this out.\"\nHovind even had the audacity to compare his situation to Job and Jesus. Despite Christians comprising the majority of the American population, he said he was being persecuted. \"If it\u2019s just money the IRS wants, there are thousands of people out there who will help pay the money they want so I can go back out there and preach,\" Hovind said.\nThe judge informed Hovind that the trial \"is not and has never been about religion.\" The judge further noted Hovind had miserably failed his fellow citizens and the men and women of the military -- who fight to defend his freedoms -- by refusing to pay taxes.\nShe recommended Kent Hovind be sent to the Saufley Field prison in Pensacola so he will be close to his family, but the final decision is up to the Bureau of Prisons. \nAfter the judge sentenced Hovind to ten years, O'Brien reported, \"even then he resisted reality\" and told the judge 'I sure would like to go home'.\""}

The finishing place in the sprint race determines the starting place in the 50-lap feature race the same day.\nDuring the standing start feature race Germany managed to get a strong lead, leaving France and New Zealand to battle it out for second place. New Zealand tried to take second place a few times but always not having enough speed to complete the takeover. New Zealand's best chance for a takeover was at lap nine at the pit stop, but France had a one second better pit stop than New Zealand did, keeping their lead.\nA few drivers crashed during the feature race and sprint race. A very impressive crash happened during the sprint race between Great Britain and Malaysia, which resulted in Great Britain's front being smashed.\nGermany, the overall leader with 65 points, easily managed to get first place, around 19.5 seconds ahead of second place France and third place went to New Zealand. It was Germany's first time that they had managed to get a double win on the same day.\nGermany and Nico Hulkenberg, were presented their gold medal by the minister of recreation and sport, Honourable Trevor Mallard, the same person who gave the announcement to the drivers, \"Gentlemen, for the pride of your nation, start your engine.\"\nFirst place, second place and third place got, as well as their respective medals, a unique piece of New Zealand, a M\u0101ori carving, which got progressively bigger for each placer."}

Mayor Nick Ebbeck said the investigations actually include having sex with prostitutes in order to satisfy courts.\n\"We, like many other councils, have made a decision to pro-actively rid our community of these illegal brothels,\" said Mr Ebbeck. \n\"We have to employ private investigators to actually go through with the act and come up with reports that will suffice in a court process. \n\"On numerous occasions over numerous days and times they had to fulfill the act.\"\nEvidence gathered by investigators has been used to close down two brothels this month. The council is set to look at five more premises at a cost of around $3,500 per case. For the fee, the council is provided with a statement and a detailed account of the encounter. On occasion a video recording is provided.\nUnder New South Wales law, local councils have to bear the onus of proof when dealing with illegal brothels in the state's land and environment court.\nWilloughby Council has also admitted engaging in the practice. According to \"The Sunday Telegraph\", investigators were paid $1,500 for two visits to prostitutes earlier in the month. Willoughby's Director of Environmental Services said the council solicitor managed brothel investigations. \nSpeaking of the programme's success, Mr Woodhams said over the last \"couple of weeks\" they were successful in closing a premises on Willoughby Road. He said the difficulty was making a case before the court.\n\"The difficulty is gaining evidence to make a case to the Land and Environment Court,\" he said.\n\"In each year, it could be potentially tens of thousands of dollars in private investigators and legal costs that councils have to bear.\"\nOther councils said to have engaged in the practice are North Sydney and Sutherland Shire.\nThere are a fair number of legally licensed brothels operating in Sydney which adhere to strict guidelines, however there are a number of unlicensed premises which also operate. \nThe New South Wales opposition has introduced legislation twice in recent years to move the onus of proof from councils and onto brothel operators. Peta Seaton, Liberal MP for the Southern Highlands attacked the Labor government for voting against the legislation.\n\"I have put all the evidence that people will be looking at today on the record in Parliament in respect of these and other councils, but in the face of private detective's reports and all the information that's in the media, Labor still voted this down on two occasions,\" she said.\nThe legislation was voted down in 2002 and 2003 by the Carr-led government.\nPremier of New South Wales since August 2005, Morris Iemma said he would encourage councils to seek changes from the government but stopped short of announcing his own proposition. \n\"The enforcement of this area of the law is with councils,\" Mr Iemma said.\n\"If the Local Government Association or the councils have got a proposition they wish to put to the government that would ease their burden on cracking down on the illegal activity then I'm happy to consider that,\" Mr Iemma said."}

However, the delay in arrival of the major new products resulted in spoiled financial results.\nThe quarter that finished in December marked the increase by 6 percent in the Microsoft sales, having reached the revenue of $12.5 billion. The delayed products - the latest versions of Windows Vista and Office 2007 - are to be launched next week. \nMicrosoft's video game business grew considerably in the quarter - its revenue increased by 75 percent, to the mark of $2.96 billion. The success of the business is explained by steady sales of its Xbox 360 console and highly demanded games like the critically acclaimed Gears of War at the end of 2006. \nThe noteworthy results have been gained by Microsoft in selling its server software applied in corporate data centers. It brought the revenue up 17 percent, to $2.85 billion. As for the operating profit, it increased by 35 percent, to over $1 billion. Following the most profitable Windows and Office, the server group, including databases, operating systems, and back-end programs used for e-mail systems, presently represents the third major product line of the Corporation. \nNet income witnessed 28 percent decrease, to $2.63 billion to be compared to $3.65 billion dollars during the same period of time the previous year.\nTo solve the problem of the product delay and support the personal computer industry, Microsoft provided free or discount coupons for upgraded versions of Windows Vista and Office 2007. Consequently, PC makers sold new computers during the last period of 2006 promising their customers that they would be able to acquire the new Microsoft products, thus preventing PC sales from standing at still point. \nThe coupon program was initiated by Microsoft in October with expectations of approximately 1.5 billion dollars in revenue to be deferred. However, with better PC sales Microsoft received the $1.64 billion.\nMicrosoft pays attention towards development of the consumer electronics business. In the end of 2006 the company launched a digital media player called Zune, a product to compete with iPod produced by Apple. However, Microsoft's section of consumer entertainment and devices is not profitable yet.\nAs for Microsoft\u2019s on-line business, it also leaves much to be desired, especially considering Internet searches. In the latest quarter there was a decline in the Microsoft's market share in searching. Still, the company continues to invest into this business segment. \nThe revenue brought by on-line services, including web advertising and search-linked ads, increased by 5 percent in the quarter, to $624 million.

Chora \"et. al.\" are reporting in the Journal of Clinical Investigation this week that carbon monoxide (CO) and the heme oxygenase-1 protein protect against the symptoms of multiple sclerosis (MS) in the related mouse model of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE).\nMultiple sclerosis is a chronic, inflammatory disease that affects the central nervous system (CNS). Although many patients are largely unaffected by their disease, MS can cause impaired mobility and disability in more severe cases.\nThe research group from the Gulbenkian Institute in Portugal used the EAE mouse model of MS to study the effects of the Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) protein encoded by the HMOX1 gene.\nHO-1 knockout mice, lacking both copies of the gene (not producing the protein), showed a more severe progression of the disease compared to wild-type mice, having normal levels of the protein. The symptoms of the disease were reversed when the HO-1 protein expression was induced using cobalt protoporphyrin IX.\nDuring MS attacks the body's own immune system destroys the myelin sheath surrounding nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord. Pathogenic T helper cells are triggered by Antigen-presenting cell (APCs) within the brain stem. The disease can cycle between attacks (relapses) followed by remission, suggesting that there is an underlying regulatory system. The HO-1 protein had been identified previously as a possible candidate for a protective gene.\nHO-1 degrades excess heme within the body acting as the rate controlling step when under inflammatory conditions. The HO-1 heme degradation pathway produces as products equal amounts of free heme, carbon monoxide and biliverdin.\nCarbon monoxide was also shown to limit the effects of the disease. Mice were exposed to a high concentration of CO for 20 days within a chamber. Mice exposed to CO had limp tails, but were more mobile than the mice in the control experiment which displayed hind limb paralysis.\nIt is still unknown exactly how carbon monoxide slows down the symptoms of EAE, possibly through the mopping up of free radicals, or through promoting the binding of iron to heme (decreasing radical production).\nThe experiments found that HO-1 did not affect the development or function of regulatory T cells. For a beneficial effect HO-1 needed to be expressed in dendritic cells, causing inhibition of MHC-II proteins, involved in presenting antigens, and inflammatory cytokines (IFN-\u03b3).\nThese experiments open up new possibilities for MS therapies, involving the expression of HO-1 in suppressing the development of MS.\nThe article went online on the 25th January 2007 and will be printed in the Journal of Clinical Investigation in February."}

Such technique could make fake drugs detection a lot easier and faster than it is currently practiced, according to the article.\nA group of scientists at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory have tested a method called spatially offset Raman spectroscopy (SORS) on a range of over-the-counter drugs, like ibuprofen and paracetamol, to show how to test whether they are fake or not without destroying the packaging.\nCurrent practice, using conventional Raman spectroscopy, in spotting fake drugs are not applicable when they are encapsulated or enclosed in bottles or blister packs. This difficulty makes analysis of suspect drug tedious as drug testers have to open the package and bring out the chemicals.\nCharlotte Eliasson and Pavel Matousek tested the drugs without removing them from their packages. They then compared the result with the known characteristics of the drugs and with the result obtained using conventional method. They reported that, unlike conventional method, SORS could identify the drugs.\nEliasson and Matousek's recent paper concluded that \"the new approach is particularly beneficial in situations where the conventional... method is hampered or fails because of [interfering signals] emanating from the packaging that contaminates the much weaker signals of the drug chemicals held in the product.\"\n\"These interfering signals can be effectively suppressed by SORS,\" the paper ended.\nSORS technology is currently under development for commercial release. A company is being set up in Didcot to develop SORS for use in the anti-counterfeit industry. \nThe technology is also envisioned to be used to monitor drugs as they go through the manufacturing process. The technique could save the industry substantial amounts of money both from counterfeit drugs and in drug production."}

Sinn F\u00e9in president Gerry Adams called the decision was truly historic, saying, \"Today you have created the potential to change the political landscape on this island forever.\"\nThe vote is historic due to the fact that Irish republicans viewed the police and the legal system in Northern Ireland as a unit of British rule since the partition of Ireland in 1921. In fact, from the start of the troubles to the ceasefire in the late 1990s, the Provisional IRA had fought the PSNI's predecessor, the Royal Ulster Constabulary.\nLast Monday, a report released by Nuala O'Loan, the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland confirmed collusion between the RUC and the loyalist paramilitary Ulster Volunteer Force.\nHe also he was also willing to meet with dissident Irish republicans such as the Continuity IRA and it's political wing, Republican Sinn F\u00e9in; and also the Real IRA, who was responsible for the 1998 Omagh bombing, saying \" However, Adams also claimed at a rally on Friday, he felt, \"In my opinion, there is only one IRA, and that's the one which fought the British for a very long time.\" \nHowever, the Continuity IRA and Republican Sinn F\u00e9in rejected Adams' offer. Ruair\u00ed \u00d3 Br\u00e1daigh, the Republican Sinn F\u00e9in president said, \"Ultimately, it is the British government which will recruit, it is the British government which will train, motivate, and above all who will pay and give the orders to such a police force.\"\nA statement from Downing Street said that British Prime Minister Tony Blair welcomed the \"historic decision and recognised the leadership it has taken to get to this point\". Irish Taoiseach Bertie Ahern called the vote a \"landmark decision,\" and that it \"has opened the way to Northern Ireland power-sharing.\"\nBlair and Ahern will meet at Downing Street tomorrow.\nSinn F\u00e9in's support of policing was one of the obstacles to the devolution process, the other is Ian Paisley's Democratic Unionist Party commitment to power-sharing. The acceptance of the police is what Blair and Ahern believe is crucial to persuade the DUP into setting up a new government.\nIan Paisley said his stand \"forced Sinn F\u00e9in to recognize support for the police and the rule of law as an issue of paramount importance for which there can be no other way\" and that \"Sinn F\u00e9in must now walk this road, the time for true, visible and open support for the police and law enforcement has arrived.\"\nSome Democratic Unionists believe that Sinn F\u00e9in had only made a commitment in words only and that people in Sinn F\u00e9in power bases would not report crimes. \nPeter Hain, Northern Ireland secretary said the vote was a breakthrough. PSNI Chief Constable Sir Hugh Orde welcomed the decision also. Professor Sir Desmond Rea, the chairman of the Northern Ireland Policing Board hoped to see Sinn F\u00e9in join the board. \nSir Reg Empey, the leader of the Ulster Unionist Party said it was \"a massive step change in the republican psyche.\"\nSocial Democratic and Labour Party leader, Mark Durkan said \"They now need to sign with no ifs or buts. As Gerry Adams now accepts, nationalist areas need policing.\"\nThe transitional assembly at Stormont is due to be dissolved tomorrow in preparation for elections on March 7. However, if the process goes astray and no election occurs, the assembly will be dissolved and remain dissolved indefinitely.\nFinally, the Indepdent Monitoring commission is due to release a report on the IRA's commitment to the peace process according to the British and Irish governments."}

At present day YouTube represents the most popular site sharing on-line video. In 2006 it was acquired by Google Inc. As it was mentioned by Chad Hurley, YouTube's co-founder, at the World Economic Forum, held in , Switzerland, the idea of paying amateur videographers was suggested by the desire to motivate and reward creativity. \nThe revenue-sharing naturally implies the site's administrators will have to prescreen the video clips before presenting them at the site to guarantee their authenticity. The task is a complicated one, as about 100 million videos are submitted by 70 million users to YouTube every day. It also implies the clips taken by the users from movies, music videos and TV shows will not be accepted as they used to be up to the current time.\nIt is quite a turn for the company as its initial success was built upon placing all the clips without prescreening them. However, it enables YouTube to avoid confrontation with videos' copyright holders. To fulfill the task of video prescreening, YouTube will have to apply the image-identifying technology elaborated by Google's best specialists. \nIt is difficult to forecast whether the overall plan will bring further success to YouTube. Consider the competing site Revver that still has considerably less users is found among the first who shared its ads revenue, and GUBA, the site provided with image-recognition screening technology, also does not reach the popularity enjoyed by YouTube."}

Three bones in the leg were broken - the cannon bone, the sesamoid bone, and the pastern bone. Laminitis took hold in the left hind leg as a result of the extra weight borne on the leg by the horse. It appeared for a while that Barbaro would recover; however, earlier this month, the horse suffered two significant setbacks that greatly reduced his ultimate chances for survival.\nThe three-year-old colt underwent emergency surgery on May 20 to fuse two joints in the damaged right leg. Further surgery was required on January 27 to insert two steel pins into one of the healed bones. The latest procedure was especially risky because it because it transferred more weight on to the leg, with the foot resting on the ground not bearing any weight.

The restoration will probably take place in mid-February. The camera shut down over the weekend, probably due to a failure of its backup power supply. It was the third such shutdown of the camera in the past calendar year. The camera had been operating on its backup power since June 30, 2006, when engineers switched from the primary power supply (\"Side A\") to the backup (\"Side B\") due to a malfunction. A review board was convened on January 29 to assess all options and to decide on a course of action. Their findings will be reported to NASA on March 2, 2007.\nThe ACS, developed jointly by four American agencies, was installed in March of 2002. It is a system of three cameras, filters, and dispersers which act to detect wavelengths of light ranging from near-infrared to ultraviolet. It is a system that was designed to last five years, according to Preston Burch, associate director and program manager for the Hubble Space Telescope. NASA also indicated that the other four main systems on the telescope remain unaffected and functioning normally. Research work will resume this week using those systems.\nA scheduled mission to the space telescope in 2008 is expected to deliver instruments to further upgrade the capabilities of the telescope. It is not known what the effect of the ACS failure will have on the scheduled mission. Burch said in a press release posted on the NASA main website, \"It is important that the review board conduct a thorough investigation that will allow us to determine if there are any changes needed in the new instruments that will be installed on the upcoming servicing mission so that we can be sure of maximizing the telescope's scientific output. We are continuing to make excellent progress in our preparations for the servicing mission, which is presently targeted to fly in September 2008.\""}

Leftist groups had labeled Palparan \u201cberdugo\u201d (butcher) for the spate of killings during his tenure as commander in Mindoro, Samar, and Nueva Ecija provinces.\n\"He has said he inspired them. You can hook the fish through the mouth,\u201d Melo said, referring to a media interview given by Palparan where he admitted he had \"inspired\" some people to \"punish\" suspected communist New People\u2019s Army rebels who had committed crimes in their communities.\nPalparan was one of four military officials who testified before the commission. They were the only witnesses who responded to the commission\u2019s summonses.\nLeftist groups and families of victims had boycotted the hearings of the commission, saying it lacked credibility and independence.\nFor his part, Jovito Palparan admitted on Monday that some soldiers could be involved in extrajudicial killings of left-wing activists.\n\"It's possible,\" Palparan was heard saying in a radio interview, noting that \"some [soldiers] are victims so it's not surprising that some get angry because it's their lives on the line.\"\nMeanwhile, human rights group Karapatan called on the Melo Commission on Monday to recommend punishment for the masterminds and perpetrators of extrajudicial killings, which, it said, mostly came from the military.\nDorris Cuario, secretary general of regional chapter of Karapatan in Southern Tagalog, said the initial report of the commission was not enough to solve the unabated political killings in the country. Southern Tagalog covers the province of Mindoro where Palparan's assignment as military commander coincided with escalation of human rights violations reportedly perpetrated by military elements.\n\"We hope [the report] is not just a facade of the commission to make people believe it was doing something,\" she said.\nCuario challenged the Melo Commission \"to serve justice\" by demanding for the punishment not only of the low-ranking policemen and soldiers but also of AFP generals and even Ms. Arroyo, whom Cuario and other militant groups point to as the masterminds of the killings.\nAside from Melo and Bishop de Dios Pueblos, the other commission members were National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) Director Nestor Mantaring, Chief State Prosecutor Jovencito Zu\u00f1o, and University of the Philippines Regent Nelia Gonzales."}

The database is comprised of about 50 U.S. state registries on convicted sex offenders. NCMEC hopes that its use of the national database as well as the support of authorities, MySpace and other on-line communities will contribute to the efficient work of the center.\nAt present time the data contained in the MySpace database is gathered by a number of state authorities. The site, in conjunction with Sentinel Tech Holdings Corp., a company involved into background verification, has amplified a technology that united all the registries. It is claimed that the technology will assist police in keeping track of about 600,000 convicted sex offenders.\nMySpace and Sentinel Tech Holdings Corp. has been involved in developing the database since December, 2006. The database has been used for identifying, blocking or deleting the accounts of convicted sex offenders on the MySpace service. The database contains special software tools to match photos and allows authorities to cross-reference photos or characteristics of sex predators against registered offenders.\nMySpace's provision of its database, however, has not proven sufficient for some critics of MySpace who allege that the network fails to protect minors from adult predators. A member of a coalition of prosecutors from 39 U.S. states, which is demanding MySpace verify the ages of all of its members, has stated that the provision of the database is not sufficient protection for minors using the website. The member threatened unspecified legal action if MySpace continues to refuse to verify its members' ages."}

H5N1 was confirmed in blood samples tested in Rome and London from the three recent deaths.\nThe Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations stated that while the threat from avian flu has decreased from last year, there still remains flare-ups around the world, urging countries to \"remain vigilant and fully cooperate with international organizations\".\nAvian influenza.\nBird flu is spread by wild birds for whom the virus is a stomach disease and, generally, not fatal.\nAlthough the disease has killed 164 people, it has only been out of 269 cases, this gives the disease around a 60% fatality rate compared to the 1918 'Spanish flu' pandemic which had a mortality rate of around 5%.\nStructure.\nThe outer coat of the virus particle is characterised by two types of glyco-proteins, neurominidase and haemagglutinin, both of which interact with sialic acid.\nHaemagglutinin has sixteen forms, H1 to H16, and binds to sialic acid on the target cell, facilitating the entry of the virus.\nNeurominidase is found in nine forms, N1 to N9, this protein allows the progeny viri to escape the infected cell by cleaving sialic acid.\nAnti-viral drugs.\nThe two main drugs against bird flu currently on the market, Tamiflu\u00ae and Relenza\u00ae, both target the sialic acid binding pocket of neurominidase. Neither of these drugs will cure the disease, but will stop its spread through the body. As such they have to be administered within 48 hours of symptoms appearing. In all 9 sub types of neurominidase, the structure of the target area for the drugs is the same. There is also a flu vaccine but the current flu vaccine does not protect against H5N1.\nCatching the disease.\nHuman to human transmission is very rare, at the moment bird flu can only be caught from prolonged exposure to infected birds, specifically their droppings from which the bird flu virus has been crystallized and parts of the structure solved. \nUnlike diseases such as smallpox and measles, for which their are effectively protecting vaccines, the flu virus constantly mutates. Each year the virus is slightly different from the last, this is the genetic drift of the virus - small point mutations on the surface, causing an evasion of our immune system. Many of the problems arise when there is a major shift of the surface proteins, for instance when a different subtype appears, such as H5. \nThere are three strains of human influenza circulating around the globe; H1N1 first isolated in 1933, H2N2 first isolated in 1957 and H3N2 first isolated in 1968. Other than humans; pigs, seals and horses have various strains of influenza, however only wild birds have all the known subtypes of haemagglutinin and neurominidase.

It cannot be left to fate.\"\nOn January 24th, Og\u00fcn Samast was transferred to the Bayrampa\u015fa prison, Istanbul's largest prison. Before the transfer, inmates from a section of the prison were temporarily moved to another section, which, as a result, housed more than 100 inmates, 80 more than its maximum capacity. Then, the now-vacant section, often subject to inmates' complaints regarding bedbugs, was cleaned and disinfected. Finally, the walls were painted, a brand new cotton bed was put in, and red carpet was laid out on the floors of the section. \nWhen Samast was brought to the Bayrampa\u015fa Prison, inmates witnessed that he was welcomed with cheers and applause by the jail management, soldiers, and the guards. Witnesses also report that Samast was given two guards to serve him. He ate kebab, a luxury food compared to the food given to other inmates. \nAfter four days, Samast was transferred to the Kand\u0131ra F-type Prison. \nUltra-nationalist elements of the Turkish society seem to have penetrated into the Turkish security forces. These events resulted major Turkish newspapers such as Sabah, Radikal, and Vatan to accuse the Turkish security forces and the Turkish state of supporting, endorsing, and cooperating with the killers of the journalist. \nA 52 year old Turkish-Armenian journalist, Hrant Dink was assassinated in front of the Agos newspaper office, at the Istanbul district of Osmanbey, where he worked as the editor and a journalist. Dink, a brave journalist who was not afraid to discuss one of Turkey's most controversial issues, clearly called what happened to Armenians in 1915 when the land was being governed by the Ottoman Empire the Armenian Genocide.\nFollowing her father's assassination, Dink's daughter, referring to the fascist obsession with pure blood, said: \nLarge numbers of people marched protesting the killing of Hrant Dink on the day of his funeral, carrying placards that read \"We are all Armenian\" and \"We are all Hrant Dink\".

After Chicago won the coin toss, Devin Hester returned the opening Indianapolis kickoff for a 92 yards for a touchdown, giving Chicago the fastest lead in Super Bowl history. \nOn the Indianapolis first drive of the game, Peyton Manning threw an interception to Bears defensive back Chris Harris. However, Chicago could not capitalize on the turnover and punted back to Indianapolis. \nManning seemed to get comfortable on the next possession, and burned the Bears defense with a 53-yard touchdown pass to Reggie Wayne. Indianapolis did not convert the touchdown, after punter/holder Hunter Smith fumbled the snap on the extra point attempt.\nThis was the first of many weather-induced errors for both teams. Indianapolis's Robert Mathis forced a turnover after Chicago tight end Gabe Reid fumbled Adam Vinatieri's bouncing kickoff. But on the next play, Indianapolis gave it back when running back Joseph Addai fumbled a handoff and defensive end Mark Anderson recovered it.\nChicago scored the next touchdown when Rex Grossman threw a 4-yard touchdown pass to receiver Muhsin Muhammad, giving his team a 14-6 lead. After forcing a punt, Chicago lost another turnover when Cedric Benson's fumble was recovered by Colts lineman Dwight Freeney on the Bears 43-yard line. Indianapolis subsequently advanced to the 36-yard line, but decided to punt rather than risk a 53-yard field goal attempt.\nFollowing a Chicago punt, Indianapolis drove 47 yards and scored with Vinateiri's 29-yard field goal to make the score 14-9. Chicago was forced to punt again on their next drive. On the next Indianapolis drive, Dominic Rhodes took the ball to the end zone with three consecutive carries, the last, a 1-yard touchdown run to give his team a 16-14 lead with 6:09 left in the second quarter. \nAfter another Chicago punt, the Colts advanced to the Bears 36-yard line before defensive back Charles Tillman ended the drive by forcing and recovering a fumble from receiver Bryan Fletcher. But on the next play, Grossman fumble a snap and defensive back Raheem Brock recovered the ball. Manning then led the Colts to Chicago's 17-yard line. With 2 seconds left, Vinateiri attempted a 36-yard field goal, but his kick sailed wide left and the score remained 16-14 at halftime.\nVinatieri redeemed himself in the second half, kicking two field goals in the third quarter to make the score 22-14. Chicago kicker Robbie Gould made a 44-yard field goal to cut the score to 22-17, but they were the last points Chicago would score in the game. On Chicago's next drive, Colts defensive back Kelvin Hayden intercepted a pass intended for Muhsin Muhammad and returned it 56 yards for a touchdown, to make the score 29-17.\nThe Colts managed to tame the Bears offense for the remainder of the game. Colts defensive back Bob Sanders intercepted Grossman's pass on the next Chicago drive. After trading possessions, Chicago got the ball back one last time with 1:42 in regulation, but it was not enough for Grossman.\nRhodes finished with 113 rushing yards and a touchdown, while Addai rushed for 77 yards and caught 10 passes for 66 yards.

Several hooligans have been arrested but no suspect has been arrested for the death of Raciti yet.\nClashes erupted after the Serie A Sicilian derby between Catania and Palermo. The match, which started earlier because of public safety concerns, had already been interrupted once, after 58 minutes. After a controversial goal from Caracciolo (which may or may not have been offside), fans started rioting and tear gas drifted onto the field. \"We had to go back to the changing rooms because we couldn't breathe. If we cannot get into our heads that football is a sport we cannot live in the world of football.\" said Palermo coach Francesco Guidolin reacted.\nAfter 40 minutes the players were able to resume the match, which Palermo won 2-1. Di Michele used his hand to score the winning goal, which the referee didn't notice. After the game was over, aggression continued outside the football stadium, with dozens of injured taken to the hospital.\nIn response to the ongoing football violence in Italy and after this particular incident, Italian Football Federation commissioner Luca Pancalli suspended all professional, amateur and national team matches. He had warned about such a measure earlier last Sunday after riots in several cities. Catania chairman and owner Antonino Pulvirenti stated his intention to leave the football world. In a reaction to the events, Maurizio Zamparini, chairman of the Palerma football team, called for stricter football laws, such as in the United Kingdom. Italian prime minister Romano Prodi stated: \"...we need a strong and clear signal to avoid the degeneration of this sport which we are seeing more dramatically and more often.\"\nThe day after the events, graffiti appeared in the headquarters of local newspaper Il Tirreno in Livorno and in the city of Piacenza, hailing the events as revenge for the death in 2001 of anti-globalization activist Carlo Giuliani.

The alert comes after seismologists began monitoring a grouping of small tremors moving north along the cascadia subduction zone from nearby Washington State. \nThe phenomenon is called Epesodic Tremor and Slip (ETS), and it occurs on average every 14 months. ETS is causing the fault to begin moving in the opposite direction, in this case, Vancouver Island is actually shifting to the west, instead of to the east. This causes an added pressure on the strained fault line, and leads to the higher probability that a major earthquake could occur.\nThe Cascadia subduction zone, running from Vancouver Island to northern California is one of the most volatile geologic fault lines in the world. Unlike the well known San Andreas fault, which has the potential of generating earthquakes in the 7\u20138 range, the Cascadia fault line has the potential of releasing mega quakes in the magnitude 9 range - the size of the Sumatra quake that killed over 250,000 people, mostly from the tsunamis it triggered. \nA quake of that magnitude could devastate a wide area, including Vancouver, British Columbia, Victoria, British Columbia, and Seattle, Washington, a denselypopulated area with close to 6 million residents.\nThe Canadian geological survey points out, however, that this is only a higher probability, and the chances of a cataclysmic earthquake in the next week is still relatively low.\nVancouverites often are unaware of the potential risk right below their feet. \n\"Living in Los Angeles, we always got those little reminders every time the ground rumbled. We are indeed living in Earthquake Country. Up here, though, we don't get them as often, so I think people really forget that we live in an earthquake zone. And because we don't get those little shocks from time to time, that stress is just building and building, and who knows, these little tremors we're getting now, might be the straw that breaks the camel's back.\""}

Soon cheers drown out the song as the multicoloured performers appear on stage. A somewhat unusual introduction; but this is no ordinary show, and these are no ordinary attendees. This is Further Confusion, the second largest furry convention in the world.\nThe volunteer organizers have something to cheer about, too; have gathered from far and wide at the DoubleTree Hotel to indulge their love of anthropomorphics, and Further Confusion's 9th year is its largest, with a paid attendance of 2061. Their gains mirror those of , a similar convention held in Schaumburg, Illinois which grew 35% last November.\nBoth events feature art shows and auctions, live puppetry performance, masquerades, variety shows, games and parades, as well as panels that range from science and technology to society, sex and spirituality. Filling out the schedule, the hotel walls are lined with announcements of public and private room parties for separate groups. At night, the disco floor fills with dancing cats, dogs, and dragons.\nFor some, dressing up plays a large part of the convention - almost 300 brought a full costume. There are few professional mascots here, though, and only one or two of the costumes would be recognized by even the most avid cartoon-watcher. Instead, each act is planned and performed by other attendees, wearing \"fursuits\" of their own design. Many play off the year's secret-agent theme \u2014 \"Fur Your Eyes Only\".\nOther fans seem content to restrict themselves to small accessories \u2014 perhaps some combination of paws, ears, or tail. Each fur bears a 3\"x2\" badge detailing their personal character, or \"\". Often these characters are better-known than the people who play them.\nIt may seem lighthearted, even frivolous, but these conventions are becoming big business. Furry fans spent over $180,000 for lodging during the five days (Jan 18-22) of Further Confusion, and another $50,000 at the art auction. Attendees also purchase all manner of merchandise from attending dealers and artists, from on-the-spot art commissions and comic books of all ratings to prints, sculptures, and plush toys - even their very own fluffy tail.\nOf course, any business has risk, and conventions can drain wallets when the sums just don't add up. The first furry con, ConFurence in Southern California, ran successfully for over a decade, but cost its new organizer an estimated $60,000 in its last four years due to falling attendance before folding in 2003.\nAnthropomorphic Arts and Education board member says that won't happen to Further Confusion. Indeed, the convention ran a healthy surplus of almost $30,000 on $125,000 revenue last year, allowing it to pay off the last of its old debts and save for the future. As Torkelson explains: \"The idea is if for some reason, say an earthquake happens, and it cripples the revenue stream, the convention will be able to survive into the next year. It does help our staff to know that we have [a reserve].\"\nThe reserve also gives AAE the financial flexibility to fund charities throughout the year, a big part of its 501(c)(3) mandate. Over the nine years of the convention, attendees have raised over $60,000 for a variety of animal sanctuaries, wildlife refuges, and the Comic Book Legal Defense Fund.\nFurther Confusion's hopes for the future are high. Chairwoman Laura Cherry noted that, unlike previous years, the board has \"gone all out\" for next year's tenth anniversary, booking as many rooms as the hotel could offer. The host for 2009 has yet to be decided, but for many fans the question was not whether the current hotel will reach a limit, but when - and where - the convention will find a new home."}

If the owners fail to demolish their own houses the authorities have warned they will do so themselves and charge them for the cost.\nThirteen homes owned by members of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness were bulldozed last November, although other homes in the village owned by non-Hare Krishna residents were not touched. Gauhar Beyeseyeva of the Kazakh Foreign Ministry is quoted as saying (to the members of the Hare Krishna commune) \"We were denied the OSCE chairmanship specifically because of you people.\" \nAmanbek Muhashov, the chair of the committee for religion under the justice ministry told the Kazakh daily \"Kazakhstanskaya Pravda\" that some of the group members acquired land for the settlements by giving misleading information and thus the property did not conform to local regulations.

These books are no longer under copyright. \nPrinceton's 250 years old library has a collection of more that 6 million printed works, as well as about 5 million manuscripts and around 2 million nonprint items.\nTogether with Princeton's library system Google is to determine specific parts of the collection that will afterwards be digitized. \nGoogle's Library Project is rather young, being introduced in late 2004. It started with a group of several major library systems. Among them there were: New York Public Library, and several academic libraries of Harvard, Oxford, Stanford and the University of Michigan.\nThe second flow encompassed library systems from the University of California, which was later followed by the University Compultense of Madrid and Catalonia's National Library. Among others to join the second round were the universities of Wisconsin, Madison, Virginia and Texas University at Austin.\nThe works that remain covered by the copyright law were digitized only at the libraries of Michigan and Texas. Google was sued in October 2005 by several major U.S. publishers. While the case is yet to come to trial, the publishers' goal is to block Google's plans to make a storage of copyrighted works that is free-to-use."}

The loss extends the franchise-record losing streak of the Celtics to 15 games.\nThe Celtics could not keep up with the Pistons during the game, falling behind 16 points at halftime and 22 points after three periods. A rally by the Celtics in the fourth period gave Boston a glimmer of hope but Detroit's starters returned to hold off the Celtics.\nPistons coach Flip Saunders was not pleased by the effort his team gave in the fourth quarter. \"Your main guys should have the opportunity to sit down and ice in the fourth quarter of a game like that,\" he said. \"We had to bring those guys back with five minutes left to make sure we won the thing.\" A 16-2 run by the Celtics midway through the final quarter brought the team back to within 10 points of the Pistons, but the Detroit starters returned after a timeout to quash the burgeoning Celtics rally.\nDoc Rivers, Celtics coach, was less enthused by his team's late run.\n\"I'm not going to put a lot of stock in that. I'm not sure how much the other team was still competing at that point.\" Adding to the team's woes was the news that star Paul Pierce was sent home by team doctors with an infection in his left elbow. This latest development will push Pierce's return to the lineup beyond the All-Star break. Pierce has missed the last 23 games with a foot injury.\nWhile the Celtics trailed by only 5 points after one quarter, the Pistons shot 72% from the field in the second quarter, led by Antonio McDyess with 10 points. Rivers attributed the problem to the team's bench play. \"The bench really put us in a hole in the second quarter - it was a five-point game when they went in there.\"\nThe Pistons are next at home against the Los Angeles Lakers on Thursday, while the Celtics return home to face the Miami Heat this evening."}

Their families have sued the company, claiming the suit was the only way to disclose the events surrounding the deaths.\nLocating the contract awarded to Blackwater has proved difficult -- the Pentagon has denied repeatedly that such a contract exists. The contract was extremely deeply nested beneath other contracts, obscuring its existence: KBR, a Halliburton subsidiary, has subcontracted to ESS Support Services Worldwide, which provides dining services. ESS hired Blackwater, but only indirectly, through a third company.\nThis was confirmed yesterday by Army secretary Francis Harvey, in a letter to Representatives Henry Waxman and Chris Val Hollen. This reverses earlier statements by Harvey, for example, in July he stated that KBR \"has queried ESS and they are unaware of any services under the ... contract that were provided by Blackwater USA.\"\nVan Hollen said, \"This ongoing episode demonstrates the Pentagon's complete failure to safeguard taxpayer dollars.\"\nThe House Oversight and Government Reform Committee has scheduled a hearing on the Blackwater contract, to take place next Wednesday.

She thanked him for his support, describing him as \"very sweet.\"\nThe visit took place following an invitation by Labour MP for Leicester South, Keith Vaz, who led calls for action against the treatment of Ms Shetty during her stint on the reality TV show. Celebrity Big Brother was criticised by public and politicians alike last month after Ms Shetty's treatment by other contestants erupted in an international race row.\nToday, she told reporters she had thanked the PM for his support \"to me and my country\".\nHer visit drew widespread media attention and she was greeted at Parliament by a media scuffle, including over 20 reporters from her native India.\n\"To see how so much respect has been bestowed upon me has truly been an honour,\" she added.\nAccording to organisers, the Commons chef had even prepared a special dessert in her honour \"Shilpa's delight\" and she was also introduced to Culture Secretary Tessa Jowell. \nThe actress was crowned winner of Celebrity Big Brother, following confrontations with fellow housemates Jade Goody, Jo O'Meara and Danielle Lloyd who were accused of bullying and racism. Despite denying the claims, all three lost most of their major endorsements and Jade and Danielle's partners are said to have left them.\nPoliticians became embroiled in the proceedings when media regulator Ofcom received more than 40,000 complaints from viewers.This resulted in the row reached both the House of Commons and India, where chancellor Gordon Brown's bridge-building visit was overshadowed by controversy caused by the programme.\nIn the evening, Ms Shetty travelled to the city of Leicester to meet with members of Keith Vaz' constituency. Reena Combo, editor of British Asian entertainment magazine Ikonz, was one of the guests. Ms Combo felt the visit would boost a sense of belonging amongst Leicester-South's largely Asian population.\n\"I think it's wonderful to see Shilpa Shetty taking the time to visit the people of Leicester. There has been a great deal of national interest in Shilpa since her appearance on Big Brother but many of the people here, especially the Asian community, have been fans of the Bollywood star for much longer so it\u2019s nice to see her rewarding her loyal supporters.\"\n\"She has over the last few weeks become an inspiration to many and become very much a part of British life.\"\nAs yet, the Bollywood actress continues her tour of the country as an unofficial ambassador for the Indian film industry and has been invited to attend a Commonwealth reception at London's Marlborough House on March 12, where she will be meeting with the Queen."}

This discovery could affect the flags of New Zealand, Australia, Papua New Guinea, Samoa and Brazil, although the new star is located very close to the westernmost star and invisible to the naked eye.\nThe American scientists found the new stars in the Southern Cross by using the Chandra X-ray Observatory, a space satellite run by NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration) which uses x-rays.\nWhen the scientist team, led by David Cohen of Swarthmore College in Pennsylvania, were using the Chandra telescope, they, to their surprise, saw two x-ray glows, each representing stars, where they expected to see one. The new star appears to be orbiting Beta Crucis, the westernmost star in the Southern Cross, once every 2,000 years. Doctor Nick Lomb, an astronomer at the Powerhouse Museum, Sydney, Australia, said that the reason the star had not been found before was because the glare from Beta Crucis is too great and \"It would be like looking for a glow worm next to a floodlight.\" Before the recent discovery, it was already known that Beta Crucis had a partner, which is invisible to the human-eye.\nMr Cohen said that they found it by accident, as they were really trying to get information about the x-rays emitted by Beta Crucis. \"We were interested in how the highly supersonic stellar winds of hot, luminous stars produce X-rays.\"\nThe star found at the bottom of the Southern Cross, Alpha Crucis \"Acrux\", also has a partner star, which is also invisible to the human-eye. This invisible partner is not featured on any flags.\nDr Lomb said the apparent separation between each star is like looking at two headlights from 100 kilometres away, even though the two stars are actually 60 billion kilometres away from each other.\nDr Lomb said that if Australia was to put all eight stars in the Southern Cross onto the Australia flag then \"the flag would have to be huge, probably the size of Sydney.\" Astronomer Alan Gilmore from University of Canterbury's Mount John observatory, also agreed that flags should not be altered because it is not about how many stars there are in the Southern Cross, but the magnitude of the stars. Mr Gilmore said: \"What you see by eye is what you see on the flag. If you wanted to add more stars, there's no end of stars you can put on if you go down in order of brightness. It would get very confusing.\"\nMr Gilmore has said that in 20,000 years that Southern Cross will be different anyway, because the top star, Gamma Crucis is 90 light years away from Earth, while Alpha Crucis, Beta Crucis and Delta Crucis are all around 350 light years away and they are all moving in different directions. And Dr Lomb said that Alpha, Beta and Delta Crucis will die in a few million years.\nThese findings were presented to the American Astronomical Society, Seattle, Washington, by an undergraduate of Mr Cohen's team, Michael Kuhn."}
