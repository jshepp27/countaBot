I have a solid understanding of some undergrad level machine learning algorithms and Ive worked withgot an overview of some more sophisticated stuff through my job. Im very impressed that e.g. Siri can act like shes talking to me but I have a pretty good idea of what the man behind the curtain looks like and I know theres no deep magic going on. I think machine learning is basically the process of throwing a bunch of statistics at the wall and seeing what happens to stick.']),\n ('planet inhabitants',\n  ['Im of the opinion that when we are born we are born with a citizenship to planet earth. I think that the idea that that anyone can own such a large part of the planet is inane and I believe that we should be freely able to explore the world. When people complain about immigrants or refugees overcrowding and ruining the culture of their country I actually cringe. The most human and compassionate thing to do should be to always care for and welcome others and not care about superficialities like nationality. Whenever theres talk of refugees and the conditions that they were previously living in people are quick to say that its not their problem but ultimately any problem facing humans is humanities problem.']),\n ('Cold War',\n  ['Fairly simple premise.

This is entirely serious and I only suggest this in the best interest of the dogs. First off I currently volunteer at an animal shelter and have for about years. In that time I have noticed that two basic groups come to the shelter to find a pet. The groups are either a family or a person who wants a dog but doesnt knowcare about specific breeds and doesnt want to spend a lot of money on the dog.']),\n ('Anarchism',\n  ['Ive got to be honest I know nothing about the anarchist movement and everything ive seen on Reddit has made me think less of them.I went over to rAnarchism and ranarchy and didnt find anything more thought provoking.First of all what is so wrong with the state that is needs to be abolished. I dont like it the way it is either but I think it just needs tweaking.Secondly I dont see how you cant have anyone in charge. Either you have the system we have now of representative leadership you have direct democracy or you have a power vacuum. If you have a power vacuum how do you stop the person with the most guns taking over?I have other issues but those two are the biggest. What are the advantages of anarchism over our current system and how will you anarchism stop itself being run by war lords.']),\n ('stds',\n  ['I do not believe that there is any reason to worry about STDs anymore as a heterosexual male to the point of avoiding unprotected vaginal sex with strangers. Pretty much all of them are only minor inconveniences. HIV is reliably treatable now so as long as you treat it when you get it it wont be an issue. Most are treatable so as long as you get periodically tested you should be fine and there are no untreatable ones that are severe. I think this also applies to women and gay men but to a lesser extent as they still have greater risk and HPV vaccination of women only doesnt help gay men.']),\n ('Solitary confinement',\n  ['First of all I am largely opposed to the prisonindustrial complex. I feel that many of the laws behind it are arbitrary re the drug war and victimless crimes and that even many of the violent criminals who are jailed dont need to be locked up for as long to prevent them from being an immediate or persistent threat. In fact I believe that long term incarceration under harsh conditions is something which actually causes further social harm directly to the person incarcerated and to the society which the prisoner will be released into after an extended period of incarceration. Also if the person has dependents they too might suffer more if their material needs are not adequately provided for.Subsequently if some sort of punishment is required for violating some sort of socially accepted institution then I feel that some form of shaming shunning and exile are possibly effective alternatives to prevent crime before we decide to incarcerate someone for an extended period of time or issue fines which they may not be able to pay.One advantage to this approach is that the punishment is more directly democratic. Its not a punishment which is wholly issued by a sitting judge who is appointed to represent the public and who arbitrarily decides a perpetrators fate.']),\n ('Elite',\n  ['This is astounding. For decades people have been lamenting the power that the elite have in every country. Things have always gone according to the elites plans the candidate that is backed by the banks and the corporations always wins and they always get their way. The few movements against this like occupy wallstreet Bernie Ron Paul they have all been pretty much mocked and put down without any influence at all on the way the system works. The elite never even broke a sweat against any of these movements and dropped a few million here or there for some campaign to take down the annoyance.']),\n ('iraq government and citizens',\n  ['ISIS isnt about the US it isnt about Bush or Obama. ISIS was created because of internal forces within the gigantic Islamic world. It isnt about us and to think it is is just arrogent and self centered lazy thinking.I hear lots of people arguing that it is the actions of X or Y president that caused ISIS to exist but I think the internal ideologies and economic cultural an political forces within the middle east are much more significant than anything the US did even the US invasion or whatever the US did or didnt do afterward may have only slowed or hastened such an explosion in the middle east for a few years.']),\n ('Race (human classification)',\n  ['Points to consider Race is almost exclusively based off of skin color which is a spectrum void of definitive boundaries. Racial categories are arbitrary segments of the skin color spectrum. There is the same or more genetic variation within racial categories than between racial categories. in other words similar skin color doesnt necessarily mean similar genetics. If a persons race cannot be determined by their skin color alone it is determined by their ancestry. However all humans share a common ancestry that leads back to Africa thus eliminating biological ancestry as a basis for separation into arbitrary racial categories.']),\n ('universal healthcare',\n  ['This type of post has probably already been made a handful of times but I wanted to include some of my own thoughts. I live in the UK so I have grown up in a country that does provide universal healthcare. I firmly believe in this model from an ethical and social standpoint.Ive recently started reading the book Freakonomics. I wanted to see some discussions of the book on reddit and I came across an AmA of the author Steven Levitt. Somebody asked him his views on universal healthcare to which he repliedIm not so sure about universal healthcare.what i think we really need is for people to pay a big chunk of their own health care costs so the whole system starts to act more like a market and less like an entitlement. when health care is of GDP we cant treat it like an all you can eat buffet.Now Im not ranting or saying I flat out disagree with his statement factually because I do not know enough about financial economics to do so but as somebody who believes universal healthcare should be a human right or entitlement as Steven Levitt has put it I struggle to understand how humanity as a whole would benefit from persisting with privatised health care.']),\n ('Subsidy',\n  ['As I see the idea of a Universal Basic Income on the rise among countries in Europe and even some congressmen I started to become startled. As I consider myself a fiscal conservative I wonder how the cost would be determined and where that money would be obtained. Obviously the first word that comes to mind is taxes. The second idea that comes to mind is abuse. I have seen and known many people who have taken advantage of the current installments of Government Welfare and different programs.']),\n ('Star Wars: The Last Jedi',\n  ['As background I have been a big fan of Star Wars for a long time. I saw the original trilogy as a child and have rewatched it many times since I consider those movies to be film classics and among the best and most iconic scifi movies ever made. The prequels which I enjoyed as a child I now find to be weak and uncompelling. I dont really have a desire to rewatch them but I still accept them as part of the Star Wars universe. The Force Awakens was the first Star Wars movie I was old enough to see in theaters and although I dont think its quite as strong as Episode IV or V its my personal favorite.']),\n ('advocates of abstinence',\n  ['I keep reading posts one is at the top of r now insisting men should be able to decline child support for a child they would prefer be aborted that is to say if a woman doesnt have an abortion child support could be optional. Aside from the havoc this would cause fiscally I dont see why men cant be expected not to fuck women they wouldnt have a kid with or deal with the consequences. Women have been told in politics all along that abstinence is the only way to avoid pregnancy for sure and access to abortion and birth control is continually restricted because of this idea.ETA My POV is largely hinged on whether or not the child is wanted it exists and has needs. These needs trump its wantedness. !']),\n ('Genocide denial',\n  ['Let me be perfectly clear here Im not attempting to trivialize genocide or ethnic cleansing or any sort of largescale act of injustice. Every such act is abhorrent and needs to be prevented if possible and remedied if not.I have found myself unable to have meaningful conversations with many of my JewishIsraeli or Armenian friends if we touch on either the Holocaust or the Armenian genocide. I dont think the emotional hypersensitivity they express is in any way justified considering how long ago these atrocities occurred and that they have not and will not affect them personally in any way.My issue here really is temporally focused which is why Im not talking about the Rwandan genocide. Most adult Rwandans today lived through the genocide and have lost loved ones that they had met and spent time with.Ive taken to referring to a victimhood complex where basically a significant portion of ones cultural or ethnic identity is based on being a victim and I think its petty and tremendously counterproductive. For example I tried having a conversation with a Jewish friend about the draw the holocaust contest that was setup by some IranCartoon and my argument was basically that you cant defend the rights of publications like Charlie Hebdo to poke fun at Islam without also having to defend IranCartoons rights to mock the Holocaust.']),\n ('forests',\n  ['It really just seems to come down to supply and demand. Just about all of our paper comes from privately owned forests called managed timberlands where trees are grown specifically to be pulped for paper production. No need for paper? No need for the trees.

It must be so extremely stressful I cant even imagine. Every single minute of his days must be planned out. I imagine the president gets briefed on the most recent shit that happened in the world minutes after he wakes up. I wonder how often he gets woken up in the middle of the night when some sort of crisis happens.']),\n ('Monarchy',\n  ['Side note I live in Canada but I believe the same argument can essentially be made by anyone whose head of state is an unelected monarch.The Queen of England is currently the head of state of Canada despite the fact that Canadians did not choose her or her family. When she dies she will be replaced by someone similarly chosen for their bloodline age and gender I.e. eldest males first.The job of Head of State is not ceremonial. The Governor General represents the Queen in Parliament and technically bills require royal assent and the Queen could decide who forms the next government or when elections are called. We live in an era where we take for granted that officials with this kind of power should be elected wherever possible or chosen by elected officials for their qualifications I.e. top unelected officials Canadian senators generals etc..I believe it is absolutely offensive on a fundamental level that our heads of state are chosen based on a medieval bloodline and that this family has an ingrained right to wealth and power beyond the scope of anything a normal citizen could ever achieve. My position goes further than to simply get rid of the monarchy I see it as no more respectable than a dictator that has set up a government to do all of the actual governing while she profits from the countrys in this case the Commonwealths hard work and wealth.']),\n ('Patent troll',\n  ['Patents currently give firms a way to attack each other over abstruse rules wasting resources on lawyers that could be better spent on RampD. Patents now apply to DNA and software instead of just cogs and wheel machines like in the day when the rules were set in place and the bureaucrats that issue them do not have the expertise to do it optimally. As a result the court system is unnecessarily burdened also due to other factors and patent trolls thrive. Giving inventors the benefit of exclusive advertising would not solve all these problems but it would reduce the stakes so there would probably be less court battles and they would be less acrimonious and costly.']),\n ('colonists',\n  ['Colonies are extremely hard to start and survive in. Have you read about Jamestown ? They succumbed to starvation and cannibalism. What about the Donner Party heading to California? They also had the same fate.']),\n ('Personal care',\n  ['The purpose of health care is to prevent disease or restore normal function using the least cost effective method available.Pregnancy can be prevented using contraception or avoiding sex. While pregnancy is a medical condition the low cost and safest treatment option is an abortion Just as insurers will authorize generic medicine in preference to name brand medicine when it is available to save cost. If the patient wants the more expensive option name brand drugs or maternity care they can pay using their funds.']),\n ('the community', ['']),\n ('reduce muslim resentment',\n  ['Hi !Im brown british born as are my parents and whilst I was raised in a muslim environment Im agnostic due to the existence of suffering but still like the tenants of fastinggiving to charity which I still follow. copied from my rukpolitics postI have been using reddit for a long time now and the more I use it the more I become jaded as a person.

I believe that the desire for organic food production is a symptom of rich and saturated societies and is what we here know as a first world problem. This desire has the potential to compromise the global food output if it becomes more widespread and increase the number of people living in hunger and dying from starvation.I dont contest that chemically produced fertilizers and pesticides and GMO crops must be used carefully and in measured amounts to get the riskbenefit balance right and yes there are risks hazards and dangers associated with them. I dont contest either that early pesticides were rather poisonous and at times did more harm than good especially when used naively.However science and engineering progress all the time pesticides become better more specific fertilizers become better to handle cheaper and less energyintensive to produce GMO crops continue what breeding programs have done in the past that is improve a plant species for more and potentially healthier output with equal production cost.And thus I believe that organic food production is a dangerous fad and that to increase food output and eradicate hunger and malnutriton we must use and improve industrial farming methods using and improving all means available to us intelligently and wisely and without the prejudice of labelling something that came out of a chemical plant as bad while labelling something that came out of a cows arse as somehow magically good and instead have a sane costbenefit analysis that takes into account all that is availabe to us.Quite simply we must not throw away much of the food production techniques what served us well the last couple of hundred years because that could kill a large portion of humans alive today.Change my view.']),\n ('Dam', ['']),\n ('people who want to excel',\n  ['I take a pragmatic and pessimistic view when regarding how other people who only know me as a statistic perceive me.

Additionally since states were worried about the power of a significant federal government the constitutional protection that the government could not remove the states rights to arm their people in militias would have been a significant and important guarantee.Interpreting it as the right of the individual to bear arms also looks wrong as the only way to read it like that would be to ignore the entire first sectionThis part of the sentence cant be separated from the first part of the sentence. While the Second Amendment isnt grammatically correct that doesnt mean we get to pick and choose which sections we want that form a complete sentence the entire amendment must be considered as a whole.I have no clue how people are reading this amendment to mean the individuals right to bear arms is protected.

I believe that the desire for organic food production is a symptom of rich and saturated societies and is what we here know as a first world problem. This desire has the potential to compromise the global food output if it becomes more widespread and increase the number of people living in hunger and dying from starvation.I dont contest that chemically produced fertilizers and pesticides and GMO crops must be used carefully and in measured amounts to get the riskbenefit balance right and yes there are risks hazards and dangers associated with them.

These increases in food production were made possible by a string of innovations and increases in productivity through technological and methodological advances in farming like crop rotation better plowing tools use of animal labour use of manure as fertilizer breeding of crops and livestock chemically produced fertilizers and pesticides and as of late genetic modification of crops.Today is the first time in recorded history that we deliberately use farming methods that decrease output under the moniker of organic food production. I believe that the desire for organic food production is a symptom of rich and saturated societies and is what we here know as a first world problem. This desire has the potential to compromise the global food output if it becomes more widespread and increase the number of people living in hunger and dying from starvation.I dont contest that chemically produced fertilizers and pesticides and GMO crops must be used carefully and in measured amounts to get the riskbenefit balance right and yes there are risks hazards and dangers associated with them. I dont contest either that early pesticides were rather poisonous and at times did more harm than good especially when used naively.However science and engineering progress all the time pesticides become better more specific fertilizers become better to handle cheaper and less energyintensive to produce GMO crops continue what breeding programs have done in the past that is improve a plant species for more and potentially healthier output with equal production cost.And thus I believe that organic food production is a dangerous fad and that to increase food output and eradicate hunger and malnutriton we must use and improve industrial farming methods using and improving all means available to us intelligently and wisely and without the prejudice of labelling something that came out of a chemical plant as bad while labelling something that came out of a cows arse as somehow magically good and instead have a sane costbenefit analysis that takes into account all that is availabe to us.Quite simply we must not throw away much of the food production techniques what served us well the last couple of hundred years because that could kill a large portion of humans alive today.Change my view.']),\n ('\"alien invasive species\"',\n  ['Its no secret that the human race has destroying habitats ecosystems and species across the planet.

I would much prefer that she were still alive and living a healthy happy peaceful life of course.I would like to understand the point of view that sees her as a martyr and the circumstances of her death as further evidence of racism and police brutality.

A world without hereditary sickness a fully functional individual that would be a sort of Apex sapiens if i may use that word. I feel striving to make sure our children and our childrens children free from whatever sickness or physical issue could happen is a great thing.But i also understand the consequences of it. Like if a designer baby with peak physical strength and height essentially designed to be a worker bee feels that heshe would want to be in another caste instead of just a worker bee and not allowed too due to hishers caste. Granted this is FAR into the future where we might have classes of designer babies some better than others at certain things.Though my fundamental belief still stands altering human DNA and creating a spiecies that would function better than regular humans is a good step in a right direction and a needed one if space exploration would become a thing Think low atmospheric pressure Air thats contaminated space radiation or things like thatSo CMW Why would doing this be a bad idea?']),\n ('\"improve body alignment\"',\n  ['I just got to a hotel after spending hours on a flight next to a person who was literally on top of me for the entire flight.

The center armrest could not be lowered as that would have prevented the person from even being able to sit down.pic It would have to be an objective measurement because simply saying this person looks too fat wouldnt go over well. And I dont think it would be feasible to go by weight a man who is and pounds would fit completely within his seat while a woman who is and the same pounds would be spilling out onto her neighbors.

They fall victim to the representativeness heuristic when they could make far better choices by actually looking at the large scale data. No arguments there.

You legitimize them by making them a victim in their own eyes.Furthermore I think its immoral to shame someone or make them feel bad for that purpose alone. In some contrived circumstances making someone feel bad might work to get them to realize theyre doing or thinking wrong but I think those are few enough as to be insignificant.I am starting to wonder if Im correct in my view mainly because I see it as one of those things I simply grew up believing and that is a poor reason to hold a position.']),\n ...]"
