The United States swiftly denied the allegations. Clive Stafford Smith, founder and director of Reprieve, said, \"the U.S. administration chooses ships to try to keep their misconduct as far as possible from the prying eyes of the media and lawyers.\" \nAccording to Reprieve, prisoners such as the Australian David Hicks, and the American John Walker Lindh were imprisoned on naval ships stationed off the coasts of both Somalia and Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean. Reprieve also noted that \"prisoners have been interrogated under torturous conditions before being rendered to other, often undisclosed locations.\"\nAccording to the United States Navy, some ships have been used for short term prisoner housing, but denied they were prisons. \"We do not operate detention facilities on board Navy ships. Department of Defense detention facilities are in Iraq, Afghanistan and Guantanamo Bay.\" said Navy Commander Jeffrey D. Gordon from the Pentagon. Gordon did acknowledge that it was a matter of public record that some individuals had been put onto the ships in question \"for a few days\", in what he labelled the 'initial days of detention'.\nAmong the United States ships named by Reprieve as having served as prison ships were the USS Peleliu and the USS Bataan, both of which are amphibious assault ships. Also named was the USS Ashland, a dock landing ship. Reprieve stated that its assessment was based on evidence from sources in the U.S. military, the Council of Europe and from testimony received from former detainees at the U.S. prison camps in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.\nOn Monday, Reprieve said it would publish details of its research later this year, in a full report on the alleged activities of the U.S. military. The organization went on to claim that the United States was imprisoning as many as 26,000 foreign detainees in secret prison facilities, including land-based prisons. Gordon was quoted as calling Reprieve's comments \"inaccurate and misleading.\""}

Approximately 50 years after federal authorities first labeled Colacurcio Sr. as an organized crime figure, they allege the 90-year-old strip club magnate and convicted racketeer is still active in violating the law. Local police with federal authorities enacted their raids in three separate counties along Puget Sound. Local police have described it as the most significant probe into organized crime in Seattle, Washington's history. The Colacurcios face allegations that include evidence of prostitution, money laundering and mail fraud. \nAccording to Robbie Burroughs of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), court documents have named the clubs \"Rick's\" in Seattle, \"Sugar's\" in Shoreline, \"Fox's\" in Parkland, and \"Honey's\" in Everett, as well as the businesses \"Talents West\" talent agency and \"Accurate Bookkeeping\" in Seattle. The Colacurcios themselves were named as subjects of the investigation and raids. The Federal government additionally enacted a restraining order, unusually, as evidence in similar investigations is normally not made public prior to any indictments being issued. The restraining order, which can only be contested for ten days, bars the Colacurcios or their agents from selling, reducing the value of, or transferring three strip clubs, Rick's, Sugar's, and Honey's, or the related hiring and bookkeeping offices.\nSeattle U.S. Attorney Jeff Sullivan has stated he plans to pursue the forfeiture of all the properties and businesses under the federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO). \"For far too long, the Colacurcios' organization has made big money operating their clubs as fronts for prostitution,\" he said. \"The Colacurcios have designed the clubs, the payment methods and the policies that encourage prostitution and to ensure they are the ones getting rich off these illegal sex acts.\"\nAs of June 3, neither the Colacurcios nor their attorneys had spoken with the media or in public about the raids and investigation.\nThe Colacurcios have a long history involving law enforcement. Frank Sr. was convicted in the 1940s for having sexual relations with a 16-year old girl. In 1957, a United States Senate hearing on organized crime identified him as a racketeer. In 1971 he was convicted on the federal level of running a bingo racket, and received a three year sentence. In the mid-70s, he served two years in custody for a tax evasion that was overturned in an appeal. In 1981, he received a conviction for tax fraud from skimming profits on a night club, and in 1991 he and his son, Frank Jr., were convicted of a similar crime for clubs they ran in Alaska.\nIn January 2008, they both plead guilty for their role in Seattle's \"Strippergate\" campaign-financing scandal which erupted in 2003. The scandal involved funnelling illegal campaign finances through various associates to the re-election campaigns of various Seattle City Council members, before a zoning election for a club they owned. The event is what led to the current raids and investigations."}

According to Robin Cahill, general manager of the Darwin Private Hospital, ovarian pregnancies occur in only 1 in every 40,000 fertilisations.\nAn ectopic pregnancy occurs when a fertilised egg implants in a woman's body in a location other than the uterus. The most common place for an ectopic pregnancy to occur is the Fallopian tubes, accounting for roughly 95% of all ectopic pregnancies. Ectopic pregnancies are generally discovered early, especially as they tend to cause bleeding in the mother, and tend to miscarry or be terminated due to the health risks they pose.\nThe mother, Meera Thangarajah, however, suffered no complications during her pregnancy, and an ultrasound performed mid-way through the pregnancy did not discover the complication. The hospital's obstetrician Andrew Miller says that having an ovarian pregnancy survive to full-term is \"unheard of\". The British Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists agrees, with a representative saying the odds of a successful ovarian pregnancy are \"no more than one in a million\", taking into account both the difficulty of bringing such a pregnancy to term and the tendency for the pregnancy to be terminated when it is discovered early.\nThe baby, a girl, was named Durga, a Hindu name meaning \"goddess\", and weighed 6 pounds 3 ounces (2.8 kg). The father, Ravi Thangarajah, says that doctors told him he was \"one of the luckiest men in the world\"."}

Swami Amritachaitanya, whose real name is Santosh Madhavan, was arrested by Interpol in March on criminal charges in a police raid at his 16-suite ashram in Kochi, India following multiple police complaints against him. Indians living in Bahrain have recently come forward and filed a case against Madhavan in India on allegations of fraudulent practices related to his supposed charity activities.\nTwenty Indians living in Bahrain filed a case against 35-year old Madhavan on Tuesday. They claim they were victims of a scam after Madhavan convinced them to invest in a charitable organization and tourist resort, but allegedly kept the money for himself. Madhavan arrived in Bahrain in 2005.\n\"Twenty of us have e-mailed a complaint to the Inspector General and Commissioner of Ernakulam police as well as Kerala Home Minister,\" said complainant Jaya Kumar in a statement to the \"Gulf Daily News\". Ernakulam is a district in the state of Kerala in India. \"He was very convincing about his charity activities as well as the resort,\" said Kumar, a purchasing officer at a company in Bahrain.\nPolice began an investigation into Madhavan in April after a woman filed a complaint alleging he had promised to start a business with her after a meeting in Dubai, but she said he disappeared after she gave him the money. Serafin Edwin traveled to the capital of Kerala, Thiruvananthapuram, last week from her residence in Dubai, in order to give testimony against Madhavan. She was greeted at the international airport by police, and is under police protection due to concerns for her safety. Her family members told \"Khaleej Times\" that she feared physical harm from Madhavan or his henchmen. Interpol has been investigating Madhavan in allegations related to his business dealings with Serafin Edwin since 2004. \"I am happy that the police finally caught up with him and he is in prison. He is a big fraud and everything that comes out of his mouth is a lie,\" said Serafin Edwin in a statement to the United Arab Emirates paper \"The National\".\nMadhavan was arrested by Interpol police after multiple underage girls went to law enforcement with allegations of rape and sexual abuse. According to Press Trust of India, police in India received complaints from three underage girls alleging he had raped them. \"The Times\" reported that Madhavan is accused of making pornographic movies with underage girls, sexual assault, rape, fraud and possession of narcotics. A police raid of Madhavan's four-story mansion in India uncovered drugs, a police uniform, a pelt from an endangered tiger and pornographic DVDs. \"Gulf Daily News\" reported that Madhavan was arrested in Kerala in conjunction with an Interpol \"red alert\", which was issued after consultation with Dubai police in 2004.\nSelf styled \"godmen\" and \"gurus\" are under increased observation by police in India following the arrest of Madhavan, and police are specifically investigating their sources of wealth and possible fraud. \"We are not against genuine spiritual leaders. But we won\u2019t allow illegal activities under the guise of spirituality,\" said Kerala home minister Kodiyeri Balakrishnan in a statement to Howrah News Service. \nG. Sudhakaran, Kerala's minister for temples, presented a different viewpoint in a statement to \"The Times\". \"They\u2019re conducting all kinds of criminal and material activities behind their spiritual exteriors. Ninety per cent of them are fake and criminals. There are so many swamis who have enlightened the hearts and minds of people, but these people are fakes with no idea about spirituality. They are only interested in women and money and muscle power,\" said Sudhakaran. Many Hindus were upset by Sudhakaran's words, as some devout Hindus consider swamis to be above the law and should not be criticized."}

Comcast and Time Warner Cable, two of the largest ISPs in North America, both made separate announcements of their plans. The actions come in the wake of an investigation by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), over whether Comcast had restricted some customers from sharing videos, music, and similar files. The FCC investigation led to a US Congress debate over whether and how much control ISPs should have over the flow of customer data.\nPublic interest groups complained in November 2007 to the FCC that Comcast had specifically targeted customers using applications that made use of the BitTorrent system, a popular form of file sharing. Free Press, an advocacy group that pushes for better oversight of cable operators such as Comcast, stated that Comcast practices were discriminatory towards users of the legal technology. \"The cable companies see a hammer hovering above their heads and are scrambling to find ways to reduce the appearance of wrongdoing,\" said Ben Scott, head of the group.\nAccording to Roger Entner, a senior vice president from Nielsen IAG, as little as 5 percent of all Internet users may consume as much as 50 percent of all the bandwidth on the Internet. \"This is the politically correct version of doing what Comcast had been doing before, though it takes the occasional [peer-to-peer] user off the hook,\" Entner said. Sena Fitzmaurice, a Comcast spokesperson, said, \"This says we won't be looking at what type of traffic that there is, even though we still need to manage the network.\"\nComcast's tests are expected to begin in Chambersburg, Pennsylvania and Warrenton, Virginia.\nWhile Comcast will attempt to throttle the speed of all its high-volume users, Time Warner Cable intends to use a different method. They will meter and bill clients, charging more money for faster speeds and larger amounts of transmitted data, functioning more like a traditional public utility, such as an electric company or cell phone service. Their metered billing test will begin on June 5 in Beaumont, Texas for newly enrolled customers. \"Instead of raising prices across the board, consumers who are excessive users would pay,\" said Alex Dudley, a Time Warner Cable spokesman. \"It is clearly the fairest way to fund the investment that is going to be required to support that use.\"\nAn Associated Press report that Time Warner Cable will bill customers between $29.95 to $54.90USD per month has been confirmed by the cable operator, with clients charged an extra $1 for each gigabyte (GB) by which they exceed their purchased plan. Art Brodsky, communications director of Public Knowledge, a consumer advocacy group in Washington D.C., has expressed concerns about the Time Warner Cable plan. Time Warner Cable's most expensive offering, $54.90, comes with 15 megabits-per-second of data transfer speed and a 40 gigabyte limit on total data transfer.\n\"An HD (high-definition) movie is 8GB or so, three movies is more than half your allowance for a month, and heaven knows what else you might want to watch,\" Brodsky says. \"This is not a relieving congestion scheme as much as it is a rationing scheme.

Four U.S. naval ships were ordered to depart from the area on Thursday. After 15 failed attempts to convince the ruling military junta to allow U.S. helicopters to deliver much needed supplies to areas such as the , Admiral , the head of the , indicated that they were left with no choice but to leave.\n\"I am both saddened and frustrated to know that we have been in a position to help ease the suffering of hundreds of thousands of people ... but have been unable to do so because of the unrelenting positions of the Burma military junta,\" Keating said via his headquarters. He said that the U.S. would still be willing to offer help if the junta simply allowed them in.\nThe and navies have also been forced to withdraw due to the junta's unwillingness to allow them to provide assistance to cyclone victims. (UN) Secretary-General had been previously assured by the ruling Burmese generals that relief workers would be allowed to help, but reports indicate this has still not happened on the ground. The UN, in its latest report on the situation, noted that Burma was faced with a \"serious lack of sustained humanitarian assistance for the affected populations.\"\nForeign aid agencies already in place and trying to help victims have reported that they continue to face problems in delivering large volumes of relief supplies in the affected regions. The U.S. naval ships had 22 heavy-lift helicopters that would have been ideally suited to the task. \"Important heavy-lifting capability in the delta would have been a standard operating procedure for relief agencies in the response,\" said Paul Risley of the . The UN group has been trying to get ten civilian helicopters to fill the role in the interim, but the Burmese authorities have still not allowed nine of the civilian aircraft to be used in the relief efforts.\nTo date, the Burmese military has allowed 106 airlifts of foreign supplies to occur, but only into , the largest city in the nation. Those delivered supplies are slated to be forwarded to the areas devastated by the cyclone. However, the ruling junta has refused to allow inland flights of foreign military helicopters to deliver relief aid. The junta believes they have sufficient abilities to deliver the resources but foreign analysts believe that the group does not wish to demonstrate to the Burmese people that it needs outside help. Doctors Without Borders has said that the relief efforts to date are not enough, and that many remote areas have received no assistance.\nThe UN determined that Burma may need relief efforts for a year. The has found that 495,000 acres of rice production areas have been damaged out of a total of 2.5 million acres. The areas are either still under too much water to sustain crops, or have been contaminated by seawater during Cyclone Nargis. According to Risley, the year-long importing of rice would be required as the damage was done just before the normal planting season. \"This year's crop will not meet requirements,\" Risley said. \"The losses to the production of rice are very deep. It would be typical for the WFP to provide food rations through the next harvest, which could be a year away.\"\nAccess by foreigners to Burma has been generally restricted since the cyclone. Visas and travel permission to affected areas have been limited by the government. The reported that \"the small number of visas and the short duration of travel permits for access\" into the areas in need of aid \"continue to impose serious constraints on the effectiveness of overall operations.\" The has said that, as of yet, there appears to be no \"second wave\" of deaths in the wake of the blocked relief efforts, which may be a sign of hope.\n78,000 people were killed by the cyclone. To date, another 56,000 remain unaccounted for, according to Burma's government."}

However, the CDC found that Hispanic students were less likely to have reduced risky behavior when compared to Black and White students in several key areas.\nThe National Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) is run by the CDC every two years, and is an anonymous, self-administered survey of students in grades 9 to 12. In the 2007 YRBS, over 14,000 students were surveyed from across 44 U.S. states, 5 territories, and several individual school districts. The combined statistics used results from 39 states and 22 large urban school districts.\nThe survey showed that males were more likely than females to engage in most behaviors involving violence or risk of unintentional injury, including driving while drinking alcohol, carrying a weapon, and being involved in a physical fight, although females were more likely to have contemplated or attempted suicide. Males were also more likely to have smoked tobacco or marijuana, engaged in heavy drinking, or engaged in sexual intercourse, while females were more likely to have fasted for 24 hours or more, vomited or taken laxatives in order to lose weight.\nWhile the proportions of White and Black students who had ever had sexual intercourse, and who had had sex with four or more partners in their lifetimes, all dropped over the period 1991-2007, there was no change in either of these statistics for the Hispanic population. Compared to their counterparts in the 1990s however, Hispanic students in 2007 were found to be more likely to have used a condom during their most recent sexual intercourse, and less likely to have consumed drugs such as cigarettes, alcohol and marijuana.\nHispanic students were more likely than White or Black students to go without food for 24 hours to lose weight, to take drugs such as heroin or cocaine, to drink alcohol on school property, and to have avoided school on occasion because of safety concerns.\nIn comparison with previous YRBS results, the survey found that the percentage of students who had ever had sexual intercourse decreased from 54.1% in 1991 to 47.8% in 2007, with a comparable decrease in the percentage who had had four or more sexual partners, from 18.7% to 14.9%. Decreases were also found in the percentage of students who had attempted suicide, who rode in a car with a driver who had been drinking alcohol, and who had smoked marijuana in the past month, but an increase in the percentage who had avoided school on occasion because of safety concerns (from 4.4% in 1993 to 5.5% in 2007).\n\"We are pleased that more high school students today are doing things that will help them stay healthy and avoiding things that put their health in danger. Unfortunately we are not seeing that same progress among Hispanic teens for certain risk factors,\" said Howell Wechsler, Ed.D., MPH, director of CDC\u2019s Division of Adolescent and School Health."}

Each of the ten plaintiffs is a child who was born to a Filipino mother and later acknowledged by a Japanese father. They filed claims for Japanese nationality between 2003 and 2005, but the government turned down because the parents were not legally married in each case. \nAccording to Japan's Act on nationality, a non-Japanese child (under 20) who was after its birth legitimated by marriage and acknowledgment can acquire Japanese nationality by filing notification, with some requirements which the plaintiffs had already fulfilled. \nThe Supreme Court ruled on Wednesday that the condition 'legitimated by marriage' results in unreasonable distinctions to violate Article 14 of the Constitution of Japan, which guarantees equality under the law. The Supreme Court left effective the rest of this provision and accepted the plaintiffs' claims for Japanese nationality. The judgment pointed out recent changes in people's notions in Japan as to family life or parent-child relationship, and also referred to two conventions which Japan has ratified. \nThere are estimated to be tens of thousands of children in similar situations in Japan and a considerable number overseas. \nChief Cabinet Secretary Nobutaka Machimura on Wednesday made a comment about the judgment at a press conference. Machimura said, \"This judgment, saying violation of Constitution, weighs so much. As a government, we should take it gravely, and we want to examine its content in detail and consider how to react.\" He added, \"I have an impression, just hearing of it, that it's a reasonable judgment. Equality under the law is an important point of view.\" \nThe ten plaintiffs filed their appeals through lawyers after Tokyo High Court dismissed their claims in February, 2007. \nWednesday's judgment was a major opinion of ten among fifteen judges. The five dissenting thought more highly of the legislative power of the Diet. (See the table below.) \nThe judgment is to say: \nOne judge in the majority, who supported the conclusion, shared a view with the five dissenting: the distinction as to legitimacy is caused by non-existence of due legislation. This judge concluded that the Judiciary can remedy the lack, because it doesn't betray the will of the Legislation of the Diet as to this Act. \nTwo dissenting judges of the five concluded that these distinctions are unconstitutional, but correction of it depends, in principle, on legislative measures by the Diet. \nThe other opinion of three dissenting judges is contrary to the major opinion.

Key actions cited include doubling the world's food production by 2030, providing resources for farmers in poor countries and increasing humanitarian aid in times of crisis.\nProtests and violent riots have resulted in parts of the world in recent months due to increasing unaffordability, and sometimes unavailability, of food. It is estimated that 862 million people, or just over one eighth of the world's population, are malnourished.\nAccording to UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, up to US$20 billion will be required annually to avert crises in the most hard-hit areas. The UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) has put the figure closer to US$30 billion. Pledges made just at the summit amounted to more than US$5 billion, according to the UN.\nDespite the largely positively-received outcome of the summit, held in Rome, Italy, there were some who felt that the proceedings could have gone better. Several non-governmental organisations (NGOs) pointed to the fact that they were not invited to partake in the discussions. Food and hunger policy adviser Magda Kropiwnicka of ActionAid commented on the strength of the final pledge: \"There were no quantifiable financial commitments. Apart from the existing UN Food and Agriculture Organisation funds, no money has been given to address the key problem of boosting capacity.\"\nWhile most delegates agreed that biofuels have been one of the causes of the food crisis, no actions were agreed upon to address this hot topic. Biofuels have been increasingly in demand in recent years, meaning that many crops that would have previously been used for food are now being used as fuel.\nThe impact that biofuels has goes further than simply increasing the demand of food crops. As fuel prices increase, so do the costs of fertilisers, farm vehicle use and the transport of foods. All of this adds up to a large increase in the cost of food.\nSome UN officials say that biofuel use has caused up to 30% of the global food price inflation of late. The United States estimates that figure to be closer to just 3%. \"The Globe and Mail\" newspaper indicates that some estimates go as high as 60%. The only consensus that could be reached on biofuels is that they provide both \"challenges and opportunities\", and need to be looked into further for a conclusive analysis on their impact on food production.\nOther factors increasing food prices are increased consumption of meat and dairy products in developing nations like China and India. Argentina noted that subsidies granted to farmers from the US, the European Union and other Western countries have also been a major player in the increase."}

It was the first loss of a B-2, which costs US$1.4 billion.\nThe aircraft, belonging to USAF's 509th Air Wing and carrying the name \"Spirit of Kansas\", was attempting takeoff from Andersen Air Force Base on February 23 this year when the crash occurred. Moisture in three of the 24 air pressure sensors caused the sensors, all on the port side, to feed back inaccurate data to the flight computer.\nThe aircraft crew believed the bomber had reached the takeoff speed of 140 knots when in reality it was traveling ten knots slower and rotated for takeoff. The malfunction also meant that the sensors showed the plane to be in a nose down position, causing it to command a high level of pitch, around 30 degrees. This, combined with the low takeoff speed, caused the aircraft to stall and veer to the left.\nMajor Ryan Link and Captain Justin Grieve, who were piloting, ejected as the left wingtip struck the ground. They were injured, with Grieve suffering compression fractures to his spine, but survived. The wreckage came to rest to the runway's left.\nThe report also noted that more effective communications could have prevented the crash. The vulnerability of the sensors to moisture was first detected by aircrews and maintenance staff in 2006, at which time it was discovered that turning on the 500 degree pitot heat prior to sensor calibration would evaporate the water and cause a return to normal readings. However, this was never formally noted and so the pilots of the aircraft were unaware of the potential problem or its solution.\nThey were also unaware that, at an earlier time at the same base, another B-2's takeoff roll was aborted at 70 knots due to abnormal indications. After inspection by maintenance personnel, it was determined that moisture in the sensor system was to blame. After turning on the pitot heat the aircraft took off without incident.\nSources.\n "}

While there are variations of the rules spread across Internet just as The Game itself has spread, Haywood plays by these rules:\nOne variation of the rules is including a grace period where a player has a certain amount of time in which to forget about The Game ranging from mere minutes to half an hour. However, Haywood says that a grace period is unnecessary.\nHaywood says many people are playing The Game which takes advantage of the White Bear Phenomenon. The Cornwall, United Kingdom-resident has experienced people playing The Game on his worldwide travels, he has even experienced an American announcing loss at a cinema in Bangkok, Thailand.\n\"When I first went to university in Cambridge, a year after hearing about The Game in Cornwall, many people already knew about The Game, especially people from London.\"\n\"The number of active players is certainly in the millions, if not tens of millions,\" Haywood says, based on the fact that he has had 500,000 unique hits to his website, \"50,000 members of the biggest Game Facebook group.\" Newspaper articles, radio mentions and webcomics featuring The Game are more reasons for the assertions of its popularity Haywood says.\n\"In my experience The Game spreads among a group of friends, eventually reaching the Internet and makes it to a new group of friends, etc.\n\"In addition, many people play actively by trying to make lots of other people lose The Game, often by initiating new players.\"\nEven though many people play The Game, its history cannot be accurately retold. Haywood first heard of the game in 2001 and while there are some Internet posts relating to The Game that date back to 2002, one person from London with claims to being the maker of The Game says he made it in 1996 with the \"aim of annoying as many people as possible.\" Haywood says this London-origin story is the only claim that has \"any kind of evidence\". But he does say that he prefers to think that someone \"discovered\" The Game, and not invented it. \"It\u2019s always been there, just waiting for someone to realise that they are playing, and hence lose.\"\nDespite running a popular site about The Game - which has something \"big\" coming up and will be announced in the next few weeks - Haywood himself gets annoyed and irritated at The Game \"all the time\" and his losses range anywhere from days at a time to mere hours in between losses depending on the social situation. The Game is still fun to play however, he says, because of the distress you can cause on other people. \"Although you can\u2019t be aware that you are winning The Game, it is still fun when your friends lose before you, or more than you. Even more fun is when they lose because of something you previously set-up, or an association you tried to make them make.\n\"I think it\u2019s a much more interesting game than it may first appear. It\u2019s also very abstract and a little thought-provoking, and it\u2019s good to see lots of young people enjoying it.\"\nAnd for those who wish to lose less often, Haywood has some \"strategies\". \"One involves trying to feel very annoyed after losing, with the hope that you will subconsciously learn not to lose like this. The other is to hit yourself when you lose, with a similar purpose,\" he says. \"Unfortunately, almost every strategy we have tried so far has backfired spectacularly.\""}

It was a two-seater based on an Alvis Firebird chassis for his own use. He then formed TVR Engineering, the name derived from his own - TreVoR. The first TVR was unveiled in 1949. It was a two-seater with an alloy body and a multi-tubular steel chassis.\nThe first production TVR was initially called simply the 'Mark I', but became known as the Grantura. This M-type glass fibre bodied car was to remain in production, in a modified form, until 1980, when it was replaced by the Tasmin, which had an angular wedge design.\nWilkinson himself left TVR in 1962 to form another engineering business, which specialised in glass fibre construction. He moved to Minorca after retiring.\nThe TVR Car Club website announced yesterday that he had died in Spain. The news was confirmed by a spokeswoman for Minorca's Mateu Orfila Hospital.

According to NASA, the soil appears to be too clodded to pass through screens on the way to Phoenix's Thermal and Evolved-Gas Analyzer (TEGA).\nImages taken by the lander's camera shows that the robotic arm has dumped a large portion of soil over the TEGA, but it failed to register any soil which might have passed through the screens leading into the analyzer. The screen is designed to let through particles up to one-millimeter (0.04 inch) across while keeping out larger particles, in order to prevent clogging a funnel pathway to a tiny oven inside. An infrared beam crossing the pathway checks whether particles are entering the instrument and breaking the beam. It is now believed that the particles are either too large to pass through the screen, or the soil is too clumpy.\n\"I think it's the cloddiness of the soil and not having enough fine granular material. In the future, we may prepare the soil by pushing down on the surface with the arm before scooping up the material to break it up, then sprinkle a smaller amount over the door,\" said Ray Arvidson of Washington University located in St. Louis, Missouri. Arvidson is the Phoenix team's science lead researcher for Saturday and digging czar for Phoenix's mission.\nNASA also plans to use a shaker inside the TEGA to shake any material or samples longer than previously planned in an attempt to break up the larger particles and clumps. Phoenix already utilized this method on Friday June 6, shaking the soil for five minutes before dumping it onto the screen. NASA plans to tell Phoenix to shake the material a little longer in order for the soil to be tested.\nWhile scientists ponder ways to fix the issue, TEGA will not be analyzing any samples. Instead Phoenix is expected to have completed tasks today such as horizontally extending a trench where the lander dug two practice scoops earlier this week, and taking additional images of a small pile of soil that was scooped up and dropped onto the surface during the second of those practice digs."}

A young man attacked a crowd with a rented truck, and then stabbed people with a dagger, around 12:35 JST (3:35 UTC) on Sunday in the Akihabara district of Chiyoda Ward, Tokyo. The suspect, identified as Tomohiro Kat\u014d, aged 25, was arrested on suspicion of attempted murder. Seven people were killed, and ten injured. \nThe injured people include pedestrians, a 53-year-old policeman, and a taxi driver, 54, who is believed to have left his taxi in order to help a pedestrian hit by the truck. About 17 ambulances came to the scene. NHK reports that medical teams trained for disasters joined the rescue. \nThe dead are six men aged between 19 and 74 and a 21-year-old woman; each was identified by police. \nThe truck, traveling on Kanda My\u014djin-d\u014dri (Kanda My\u014djin Avenue), ran into the crowd at a crossing on Ch\u016b\u014d-d\u014dri (Ch\u016b\u014d Avenue), which is a vehicle-free road every Sunday. After entering the crowd, the truck continued moving for about 30 meters. The suspect then exited the truck and began stabbing people. According to a witness, the suspect, upon being pursued by police, ran south on Ch\u016b\u014d-d\u014dri and was cornered in a narrow alley. The suspect dropped his knife after the police officer drew his gun, and was overpowered by the officer and several bystanders. \nThe suspect has been quoted as confessing to police, \"I came to Akihabara to kill people. I'm tired of the world. Anyone was OK. Today I came alone.\" The suspect, a native of Aomori City, lived and worked as a dispatched temporary employee in Shizuoka Prefecture. After being held at the Manseibashi Police Station, he was sent on Tuesday to the Tokyo District Public Prosecutors Office. \nAt the scene, a table covered with a white cloth was set for memorial flowers and other offerings on the morning of Monday, June 9. As acquaintances of the dead and passersby visited, the table soon filled\u2014almost flooded\u2014with flowers, drink bottles, pictures, and folded paper cranes. \nThe incident occurred on the same date with the 2001 Osaka school massacre, in which eight elementary school students were killed. \nNHK reported the incident as confirmed within 45 minutes, interrupting a news channel program for one minute. Some newspapers created special issues to report the incident as June 8 was a Sunday and also a press holiday, many newspapers in Japan were not scheduled for delivery on that evening or the following morning. \nThe Akihabara district is famous for its Electric Town with wholesalers and retailers of video games or electric gadgets such as PC parts, televisions and kitchen appliances. It has also become famous for distinctive trends in cultures created or supported by the youth.\nLocal residents, business owners, and government officials from Chiyoda Ward assembled for an emergency meeting on Monday to discuss whether the practice of maintaining the vehicle-free area on Sundays ought to be continued. The Tokyo Metropolitan Public Safety Commission is also expected to discuss the issue. \nSources.\nAs to the suspect's confession: \nAs to the suspect's profile: \nAs to the emergency meeting: \nAs to the memorial table: \nAs to the taxi driver: "}

Chinasat-9, also known as Zhongxing-9 and ZX-9, is a communications satellite, which will initially be used to relay coverage of the 2008 Olympic Games. The launch was conducted by the China Great Wall Industrial Corporation.\nAround twenty minutes after the rocket lifted off, the satellite separated from the third stage, into a geosynchronous transfer orbit. It will raise itself into a geosynchronous orbit, around 35,000 kilometres above the equator, by means of its onboard S-400 apogee motor. Chinasat-9 was constructed by Thales Alenia Space of France, based on the Spacebus-4000C2 satellite bus. It is equipped with 22 J-band (IEEE Ku-band) transponders, and will be operated by the China Telecommunications Broadcast Satellite Corporation on behalf of the China Ministry of Post and Telecommunications.\nChinasat-9 is the last of a number of communications satellites which have been launched by China over the last few years to boost capacity for the Olympic Games, including the Sinosat-2 spacecraft, which was lost after it failed to deploy its solar panels subsequent to its launch in late 2006. One more satellite, Echostar-CBM was scheduled to be launched, however this was cancelled due to performance issues. The Olympic Games will take place in August.\nThis is the 3rd orbital launch that China has conducted so far this year, and the 28th orbital launch of the year in total. The next Chinese launch is believed to be scheduled for August, when a Long March 2C will launch a pair of remote sensing satellites."}

The move comes as an indication that the trial of pilot-in-command Captain Marwoto Komar is set to commence within weeks.\nThe March 7, 2007 crash of a Boeing 737-400 at Yogyakarta International Airport killed 21 people. 119 others were able to escape the burning wreckage after the plane overshot the runway, going through the perimeter fence and crossing a road and an embankment to come to rest in a paddy field. Most of the deceased were Indonesians, with five from neighbouring Australia also killed.\nA final report was later issued after an investigation by Indonesia's National Transportation Safety Committee (NTSC) in October 2007. The report blamed pilot error for the crash, finding that the airliner had touched down at roughly twice the accepted safe landing speed, and that Komar was \"fixated\" on landing and \"probably emotionally aroused\". The Cockpit Voice Recorder indicated that he ignored fifteen activations of the Ground Proximity Warning System and a call from his co-pilot for a 'go-around' as the plane touched down. A number of other criticisms were also leveled at the airport, the airline and transport politicians for contributing factors.\nKomar is to be prosecuted over the crash for negligence. His earlier arrest - which he was subsequently released from pending full charges - sparked protests from Indonesian aviation groups and criticism from international groups, including IFALPA, a powerful international airline pilots' association.\nEvidence in his trial is set to include documentational evidence and aircraft wreckage, but it is unclear whether it will include the NTSC report. Much controversy was caused by the suggestion it may be used, since international regulations limit the use of materials intended for safety investigations as evidence to prove liability in criminal or civil cases.\nKamal Firdaus, council for the pilot, explained what this means for his client: \"Today the documentation has been officially accepted by the prosecutor,\" adding, \"I suspect from this it will be two to three weeks until it is handed over to the court - that's the usual practice. Usually the first hearing is two weeks after that.\" Firdaus commented that it would be \"difficult\" for liability to be established and that, \"we are ready and it will be a very interesting legal case, so let's see what will happen in the court.\"\nKomar, 45, is believed to be the first pilot prosecuted over an air accident in Indonesia despite the country's poor aviation safety record. He is being charged with three counts of negligence, but the potential sentence is unclear, as \"Aero-News\" reports that he could face life imprisonment while \"The Age\" says he can face up to seven years' imprisonment. His case is considered a landmark, with aviation groups believing his trial may set the precedent for pilots involved in future accidents."}

For reasons unknown to scientists, and after several seemingly unsuccessful attempts to break up the soil, a large amount was discovered to have passed through a screen leading to an on board oven.\n\"We have an oven full. It took 10 seconds to fill the oven. The ground moved,\" said Phoenix co-investigator Bill Boynton, a researcher at the University of Arizona located in Tucson, Arizona.\nThe lander's Robotic Arm delivered a partial scoopful of clumpy soil from a trench informally called \"Baby Bear\" to the number 4 oven on its TEGA (Thermal and Evolved Gas Analyzer) last Friday, June 6. NASA observed the method and reported that no soil had passed through the screens over the TEGA. The screen is to prevent larger bits of soil from clogging the narrow port to each oven so that fine particles fill the oven cavity, which is no wider than a pencil lead. The oven's goal is to vaporize any ice or water that may be present in the soil. Minerals may also burn off and scientists say that vapors from anything that evaporates or vaporizes will be tested and analyzed.\nAfter some debate, NASA decided to 'shake' the soil in hopes that it would break up the larger particles. To much disappointment after six tries using this method, only a few particles got through the screen. Scientists then ordered one last shake of the soil \"in the off chance we might get lucky,\" stated Boynton.\nAfter a few days of troubleshooting, NASA looked back at the soil and discovered that, for an unknown reason, a large amount of soil had fallen through the screen and was ready for inspection by the TEGA. Boynton states that it is possible that the oven might have filled because of the cumulative effects of all the shaking, or because of changes in the soil's cohesiveness as it sat for days on the top of the screen.\n\"There's something very unusual about this soil, from a place on Mars we've never been before. We're interested in learning what sort of chemical and mineral activity has caused the particles to clump and stick together,\" Boynton commented.\nPhoenix was originally ordered to put off using its TEGA until scientists came up with a solution to the clodded soil. It had been rescheduled to take readings of the Martian climate such as temperature and wind speed, and also to analyze a soil sample using the optical microscope, or MECA (Microscopy, Electrochemistry, and Conductivity Analyzer) on June 12. Scientists say that those tasks are still scheduled to take place. Pictures and results from that sample are expected to arrive on Thursday June 12, while the oven samples will take a few days to analyze.\n\"The dirt finally did start to flow and we actually got a full oven, so that problem is now behind us.

Roughly ninety-five Scouts aged thirteen to eighteen and twenty-five adult staff members were believed to be camping at the time the alarm was raised. Most of the scouts were from Omaha-Metro Area, including Omaha and Bellevue, Nebraska and Council Bluffs, Iowa. It is believed that the scouts had as little as twelve minutes to seek shelter from the time the alarm began to the time the storm hit. Early reports stated that thirty to forty scouts had been injured, that number was later reduced to twenty. \nA spokesman for the Boy Scouts of America's Mid American Council, the region in which the camp was situated, has stated that the storm activated sirens but she couldn't confirm whether the scouts were staying in tents or buildings.\nThe Scouts were participating in a training exercise at the 1,800 acre ranch roughly 40 miles northeast of Omaha. Julie Tack, a spokesperson for Iowa Homeland Security, stated that the camp was littered with debris and downed tree branches after being struck by a tornado at or around 7:00 PM Central Daylight Time. Tack went on to say that a search and rescue team had been deployed to the area. \nCamp counselors have stated that they were aware of the possibilities that storm was coming and they had heard the tornado sirens going off. There was no underground shelter for the scouts, however they had shelters designated and emergency plans had been discussed the first day of camp. Officials said most of the boys were on a hike when storms moved in.\nA camp staff member said that many scouts were injured when a fireplace in one of the shelters collapsed. Most of the injured scouts were treated at hospitals in Sioux City and Missouri Valley, Iowa. Six scouts were brought to the Missouri Valley hospital, most treated for minor injuries and broken bones. One scout suffered a broken hip and was transferred to Creighton University Medical Center in Omaha. \nMercy Medical Center, in Sioux City, have reported two patients arriving by helicopter at 8:13 PM with a third arriving by ambulance.

Today, we recognize that this policy of assimilation was wrong, has caused great harm, and has no place in our country.\" This apology was seen at more than 30 event around the country, and broadcast live on CBC Newsworld and CTV Newsnet.\nThe residential school system was created based on the Gradual Civilization Act (1857) and the Gradual Enfranchisement Act (1869), which assumed the superiority of British Ways, prompting the need for Aboriginals to become \"civilized\" by becoming English-speakers, Christians, and farmers. The funding of the schools was provided by the Indian Act (1876) and by the federal government department, Indian and Northern Affairs Canada, and operated with the support of churches, generally the Roman Catholic Church and the United Church of Canada.\nIn the 1920s, attendance became compulsory for all children aged 6 to 15, and families who refused to cooperate were at risk of having the children removed by the government, and the parents sent to prison. The school systematically tried to destroy the aboriginal language and way of life, raising the idea of \"cultural genocide\". Students were forbidden to speak their native languages, even outside the classroom, as to install the English or French language (and as result, to \"forget\" their native language), punishable by unreasonably severe corporal punishment. Practicing non-Christian faiths was also punishable by corporal punishment.\nIn the late 1990s, allegations of sexual abuse, as well as several physical and psychological abuse, arose, leading to large monetary payments from the federal government and churches to former students. The government also established the Aboriginal Healing Foundation, providing $350 million to fund community-based healing projects, and provided another $40 million in 2005.\nOn February 13, 2008, Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd made a similar apology in the Australian House of Parliament.\nOn June 21, 2008, Indian Residential School Museum of Canada is scheduled to open on Long Plain First Nation, near Portage La Prairie, Manitoba."}

The satellites launched were Skynet 5C, which will be used to relay secure communications for the British armed forces, and Turksat 3A, which will be used for commercial communications. Paradigm Secure Communications will operate Skynet 5C on behalf of Britain's Ministry of Defence, whilst Turksat 3A will be operated by Turksat, an organisation based in Turkey.\nThe launch was conducted by French company Arianespace. It was originally scheduled to occur in May, but was delayed when an incorrect guidance programme was found to have been installed on the rocket. It is believed that several commands intended for use by the Ariane 5ES, a variant of the Ariane 5 used to launch spacecraft such as the Automated Transfer Vehicle, had been installed by mistake. \nSkynet 5C and Turksat 3A separated from the carrier rocket 26 and 31 minutes after launch respectively, into a Geosynchronous transfer orbit. They will perform burns of onboard engines to raise the perigees of their orbits, and inject into Geosynchronous orbits, approximately 35,000 kilometres above the equator. Turksat 3A, which was constructed by Thales Alenia Space, will be positioned at a longitude of 42\u00b0E, where it will replace the older Turksat 1C satellite. Skynet 5C, which was originally constructed as a backup spacecraft, will be placed at 17.8\u00b0W. It was built by EADS Astrium.\nThis is the 30th orbital launch of 2008, and the third to be conducted by an Ariane 5 rocket. Overall, it is the 39th flight of an Ariane 5, and the 14th flight of the ECA variant. It is also the 25th successful launch of an Ariane rocket. The flight designation for the launch was V184, and the serial number of the rocket used was 540. The next Ariane 5 launch will occur in early July, with the Badr 6 and ProtoStar-1 satellites.\nSpeaking before launch, Arianespace Chairman Jean-Yves Le Gall described the mission as a \"very important launch for us\". Following launch, he said that he was \"very happy to share this success with you\", and that Arianespace could make a \"guarantee to Europe's governments of their assured access to space\".

The following month, a working group was set-up to look specifically into the security of the Subordinate Courts lock-up facilities.\nThe Criminal Investigation Department (CID) is now investigating the circumstances of the attempted escape to see if any officers were negligent.\nDue to the escape attempt, security at the facility has been tightened to prevent a similar incident from happening. New security measures include an extra lock fixed onto the lock-up exit gates so that another officer will need to check who is leaving the area when it is unlocked. The elevator has also been secured and can only be activated with a key.\nJamaluddian and Salman are now likely to face a barrage of charges including vandalism, police battery and escaping from legal custody."}

After a navigational system failed due to a mistake entering the jet's position the plane struggled to return to London Heathrow under Air Traffic Control's guidance as the Polish pilots struggled to understand English.\nLOT Flight 282, a Boeing 737, was carrying 89 passengers bound for Warsaw, but ran into trouble immediately after takeoff because the co-pilot entered an Easterly longitude instead of a Westerly one. The error occurred because Heathrow is just to the West of the nearby Prime Meridian Line.\nThe navigational equipment was unable to function properly and shut down as a result, forcing the pilots to rely on ATC instructions. The pilot-in-command handled radio communications while the co-pilot flew the aircraft. However, the aircraft wandered lost around the surrounding airspace for the next 27 minutes because the pilots had such a poor grasp of English.\nThe pilots, who still had some standby instruments functioning, were unable to follow the instructions and several times the aircraft was turned in the exact opposite direction to that commanded by ATC. A full transcript of communications between the plane and the controllers shows at one point ATC was forced to ask \"At what heading do you think you are flying at the moment?\"\nThe jet also forced another aircraft to take evasive action after triggering a Short Term Conflict Alert. At the end of the emergency, the crew finally made visual contact with the runway at Heathrow and landed safely.\nThe pilots had no idea what caused the instrument failure and suggested it may be mobile phone interference but testing revealed no anomalies with the aircraft systems. The report found that \"A fairly simple error...went undetected and led to a serious incident.\"\nIt went on to say that \"An incident like this demonstrates how reliant pilots have become on the Flight Management System.\" The FMS is a central semi-automated control system that handles navigation and positioning, amongst other duties.\nThe report also says that the close proximity of all London's airports to the Meridian Line \"can lead crews to make such co-ordinate entry errors of this nature,\" and that as LOT rarely uses airports to the West of the line they will usually only deal with Easterly co-ordinates. \nCriticism is also levelled at ATC, who the report says should have been quicker to realise the serious nature of the problems on board the aircraft. The entity running the control tower says they intend to use this incident for training purposes."}

Residents are not happy, and despite the short notice of the demolition, nearly 30 people showed up to protest it. Demolition was not supposed to begin until Monday June 16.\nAt about 2:30 p.m. (eastern time) on June 13, demolition crew arrived at the stable located at 428 Jersey Avenue and began to unload heavy equipment which will be used to demolish the building. This came as a surprise to residents, as demolition was not supposed to start until Monday June 16.\nDuring the early afternoon hours on June 11, the Buffalo Fire Department was called to scene after residents called 9-1-1 stating that part of the building had collapsed. Material from the building fell into the yards of at least three neighboring houses. Some of the bricks landed inside the building, while some fell into the yards of some houses behind homes on Richmond Avenue, leaving a 'V' shape.\nAt about 3:30 p.m. crews began to demolish a small portion of the stable located behind Joe Murray's home, a resident who lives behind a portion of the building on Jersey and Richmond avenues. While demolition was taking place, the section collapsed into Murray's backyard, prompting a call to police. Some residents who own home surrounding the building were inside Murray's house holding a neighborhood meeting when demolition began. No one was injured when the section collapsed.\n\"[The building] can come down any minute,\" stated Donna Berry of the Buffalo Police Department who also added that when police arrived on scene, they immediately put a stop to demolition, fearing the safety of surrounding residents and pedestrians.\n\"So many [of the] people [living around the building] are at risk, it makes me want to cry,\" added Berry.\nPolice, local politicians and area residents are concerned that demolition crews and the city are not taking the proper precautions to ensure the safety of residents during demolition.\n\"[There is] no protection for neighbors. [This is] appalling and beyond negligence,\" stated Tim Tielman, Executive Director of the Campaign for Buffalo who was referring to the negligence of the demolition crew.\n\"[In order to stop demolition] citizens must demonstrate direct harm to themselves,\" added Tielman.\nThe city's preservation board held an emergency meeting on Thursday to discuss the issue. Wikinews has learned that the owner of the building, Bob Freudenheim, gave the city permission to demolish the building because he would not be \"rehabilitating the building anytime soon.\" Freudenheim was part-owner of the Hotel Lenox at 140 North Street in Buffalo and was also an advocate to stop the Elmwood Village Hotel from being built on the corners of Forest and Elmwood Avenues in 2006 and 2007, which Wikinews extensively covered. He also financially supported a lawsuit in an attempt to stop the hotel from being built. Though it is not known exactly how long Freudenheim has owned the stable, Wikinews has learned that he was the owner while fighting to stop the hotel from being built.\nTielman states that he was in contact with Freudenheim this morning. Tielman states that Freudenheim \"is not spending a dime\" to have the building renovated. Tielman states that Freudenheim has offered to sell the building to any interested party for only one US dollar, but that he \"flip flops [his decision] constantly,\" sometimes wanting hundreds of thousands of dollars for the building. \"Wikinews\" has attempted to contact Freudenheim, but so far has been unsuccessful.\nCity building inspectors were also on scene evaluating the building and ensuring the safety of residents. Donald Grezebielucina states that \"some people are on notice to vacate their properties\", but also stated that no other precautions were being taken other than placing \"tires and scaffolding\" onto the side of 430 Jersey, which sits less than eight feet from the buildings East side.\n\"The gas has been shut off in case we lost the building, so there would be no explosions or anything like that. It's so unstable, the structural integrity is gone. The chemical composite of the trusses has changed dramatically and dry rotted. There are three vehicles in the basement which totally disappeared,\" stated Grezebielucina to the press while protesters yelled \"save our building, save our neighborhood.\"\n\"Wikinews\" has also learned that local residents have consulted a lawyer regarding the issue, and hope to petition the New York State Supreme court to issue an injunction to stop demolition. They states that Freudenheim should be \"100% responsible\" for his actions, and many are afraid that once the building is demolished, Freudenheim's charges of neglect will be abolished. Freudenheim is facing housing violations for neglecting the building. Though residents are fighting, Tielman states that \"an injunction is unlikely.\"\n\"We had a letter of violation against him. He was supposed to have started work to stabilize the brick this Monday. We all hope this building could be saved. But we've got five houses evacuated and we cannot tolerate any further delay. We've got to get people back into their homes in a safe condition,\" said Richard Tobe, Commissioner of the city's Permit and Inspection Services.\nDemolition is set to resume at 8:00 a.m.in the morning of Saturday June 14.\nMike Lombardo, the Commissioner for the Buffalo Fire Department, believes that the building was built in 1812 or 1814, making it nearly 200 years old. It is one of only three stables still standing in the city."}

The government had announced that the historic statement was to take place on Wednesday, June 11, but prior to the actual apology, Poilievre spoke on a noon-hour radio program and made remarks that were 'hurtful' to natives, as the MP later admitted.\nThe apology, which took place as planned, involved Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper offering his regrets, on behalf of the government, for decades of racial discrimination towards natives in residential schools. These schools were operated during the 19th and 20th centuries by churches and funded by a branch of the federal government. The First Nations native children in the residential school system were forced to assimilate into non-native culture, were at times victims of physical and/or sexual abuse, and were exposed to poor sanitation and a lack of medical care.\nUnfortunately, Poilievre's remarks caused more media attention than did the apology itself. In the radio show, the MP expressed his doubts about the value of compensating natives for what happened in residential schools. Natives are being given a cash settlement as part of the government's recognition of the schools' wrongdoings.\n\"Now, along with this apology, comes another $4 billion in compensation for those who partook in the residential schools over those years,\" Poilievre remarked. Many have pointed to his casual use of the word \"partook\" in his statement, which was not the case for many students, who were forced into the system.\nThe Conservative MP has now apologised for his comments. Yesterday, in the Canadian House of Commons, he spoke: \"Yesterday on a day when the House and all Canadians were celebrating a new beginning, I made remarks that were hurtful and wrong.\" He added, \"I accept responsibility for them and I apologize.\"\nWhile Harper has tried to mitigate the situation by explaining that Poilievre has apologised to national aboriginal groups, the Liberal opposition party is calling the MP a \"national embarrassment\".\nThere have been repeated calls for the MP to step down from his position. Liberal leader St\u00e9phane Dion suspects that other Conservatives think similarly, asking, \"who of the others think like him?\""}

The collapse caused at least 15 homes surrounding the property to be evacuated\nDuring the early afternoon hours on June 11, the Buffalo Fire Department was called to scene at 428 Jersey Avenue after residents called 9-1-1 stating that part of a building had collapsed. A large portion of a former livery and stable had collapsed into the yards of at least four houses that surround the stable. Some of the bricks landed inside the building, while some fell into the yards of some houses behind homes on Richmond Avenue, leaving a 'V' shape.\nAccording to \"savethelivery.com\", a website set up and dedicated to \"saving part of this historic structure\", the restraining order was granted on Saturday, forcing demolition crews to halt their work. The site also states that court papers will be filed on Monday in an attempt to hold the owner Bob Freudenheim responsible for the damage done to the building, and surrounding properties. The site states that Freudenheim has neglected the building for \"the last twenty years.\"\n\"We are an outraged and responsibly concerned group of neighbors and citizens who have rallied to oppose the impending demolition of the historic White Brothers Livery and Boarding Stable at 428 Jersey Street, just west of Richmond Avenue,\" says the site's mission statement. They seek to evaluate all options to saving the building before demolishing it, find immediate support to stop any further collapse, hold Freudenheim personally responsible for \"endangering the public safety, and compensation of the city and neighbors for expenses incurred by being displaced from their homes.\" They also want the city to personally inspect any and all properties he owns and for him to surrender the stable to an interested party who would restore it.\nFreudenheim gave the city permission to demolish the building on Thursday June 12 during an emergency Preservation Board meeting, because he would not be \"rehabilitating the building anytime soon.\" Freudenheim, along with his wife Nina, were part-owners of the Hotel Lenox at 140 North Street in Buffalo and were advocates to stop the Elmwood Village Hotel from being built on the corners of Forest and Elmwood Avenues in 2006 and 2007, which Wikinews extensively covered. They also financially supported a lawsuit in an attempt to stop the hotel from being built. Though it is not known exactly how long Freudenheim has owned the stable, \"Wikinews\" has learned that he was the owner while fighting to stop the hotel from being built.\nAccording to city officials, Freudenheim is facing housing violations for neglecting the building. Residents state that Freudenheim should be \"100% responsible\" for his actions, and many are afraid that once the building is demolished, Freudenheim's charges of neglect will be abolished.\nAlthough a restraining order is in place, residents still fear that demolition crews will attempt to continue demolition. As a result, police have a permanent detail on location to make sure everyone including both protesters and residents, follow the law.\nA rally is planned to take place today at 1:00 p.m. for anyone interested in saving the building."}

Proclaiming the museum as belonging to the people, Koirala said, \"Today the son of a common people has hoisted the country's flag in this palace. Now Nepal has entered a new era.\"\nNepal's deposed king Gyanendra vacated the palace on Wednesday, after the newly elected Constituent Assembly voted to abolish the 239-year-old monarchy on May 28. He then moved to Nagarjuna Palace, a summer home on the outskirts of the capital Kathmandu, where he is now living as a civilian. However, this home is only a temporary one, and he will soon be asked by the government to leave it as well.\nPrime Minister Koirala said he was glad the transition occurred peacefully. \"The world's eyes are on Nepal for the unique example it created of proclaiming a republic without any bloodshed,\" he said. He also thanked the former king for \"understanding the desire and expectation of the people by voluntarily moving out to live an exile-like life.\" Koirala also addressed the need to focus on more pressing issues, such as drafting a new constitution and choosing a new federal structure.\nThe process began around two years ago, when a national uprising forced the king to relinquish the absolute power he had installed and to reinstate the parliament. In late 2007, the parliament agreed to declare Nepal a republic, which was to be implemented after the April 2008 elections. The Maoists, who had been fighting against the monarchy for over 10 years, won the majority of seats, and the monarchy was officially ended in an overwhelming vote.\nDespite the ceremony, Narayanhity National Museum is not yet open to the public. Nepali home minister Krishna Prasad Sitaula said, \"After proper preparation, the palace will be opened to the public in two to three months.\" There are some differing opinions of what to do with the museum; Nepal's national library wants the museum to include a national archives of important documents, while others want to develop the museum into a major tourist attraction.\nOfficials say the museum will likely include the king's crown, sceptre, and royal throne, as well as a 1939 Mercedes-Benz given to Gyanendra's grandfather by Adolf Hitler. \"The car will be a major attraction there,\", said Govinda Kusum, a senior Home Ministry official. King Tribhuvan used to ride the Mercedes when there were no other cars in the country, and it currently lies on the palace grounds, after an engineering college in Kathmandu said they didn't have enough money to restore it."}

During that time at least four fuel storage tanks were installed on the property. Two are listed as 550 square feet while the other two are 2,000 square feet. All of the tanks are designated as a TK4, which New York State says is used for \"below ground horizontal bulk fuel storage.\" The cost of installing a tank of that nature according to the state, at that time, included the tank itself, \"excavation and backfill,\" but did not include \"the piping, ballast, or hold-down slab orring.\"\nProperty reports give the tanks a 'construction code' of a \"C - Average\", meaning the tanks were not designed to last for a significant period of time. That rating has residents concerned that the tanks could pose an environmental hazard if they are not properly taken care of.\n\"Wikinews\" has not been able to determine if the tanks have been removed or if they were emptied when the gas station closed sometime in the 1980's. \"Wikinews\" has also contacted the city of Buffalo for a comment regarding the tanks, but has yet to receive a response.\nThe building was scheduled for emergency demolition on Thursday June 12, but was stopped by police after residents raised concerns for the safety of those living around the building. According to New York law, since the city ordered the demolition, they are required to perform an 'Environmental Impact Assessment' or SEQR when a project or demolition has the possibility of posing an environmental hazard.\nAccording to New York law, a SEQR should be performed \"to incorporate the consideration of environmental factors into the existing planning, review and decision-making processes of state, regional and local government agencies at the earliest possible time. To accomplish this goal, SEQR requires that all agencies determine whether the actions they directly undertake, fund or approve may have a significant impact on the environment, and, if it is determined that the action may have a significant adverse impact, prepare or request an environmental impact statement.\"\nThe law states, \"SEQR requires the sponsoring or approving governmental body to identify and mitigate the significant environmental impacts of the activity it is proposing or permitting.\" It also states that it is the duty of the governmental body in charge of a project to enforce the laws of the SEQR. It also states that agencies must give \"appropriate weight with social and economic considerations\" when undergoing major projects.\nThe law also allows citizens to enforce the regulation stating, \"citizens or groups who can demonstrate that they may be harmed by this failure [SEQR], may take legal action against the agency\" or governmental body behind such a project. The court system in New York has been known to \"consistently\" rule in favor of plaintiffs who file lawsuits against agencies who do not perform a SEQR.\nResidents won a restraining order to stop demolition after State Supreme Court Justice Judge John. F. O\u2019Donnell signed a temporary injunction. Residents are concerned demolition crews moved too fast, and are not doing enough to protect them and their surrounding properties. They are also concerned that the city did not consider all the options or risks before ordering the building to be demolished.\nOn June 15, Judge Jerome C. Gorski ruled that the city can resume demolition, but \"on a limited basis\" only to remove fallen rubble that landed on properties, and to remove any loose bricks or material from the building, but not below its truss line. Because of the risk of further collapse, the workers are ordered \"to use only hand tools.\" to remove the loose material and debris. Residents are attempting to save portions of the building's side walls and its facade. The demolition crew began to remove some materials, as ordered by the court on Tuesday, June 17.\nJudge Gorski also ordered that the plaintiffs present their case in front the State's Supreme Court in Rochester. The hearing took place on Monday morning on June 16 at 10:00 a.m. (eastern time), and the case is currently \"being discussed,\" said an anonymous source close to the lawsuit to \"Wikinews\".\nBob Freudenheim is the building's owner who has housing violations against him for neglecting the building. Residents state that Freudenheim should be \"100% responsible\" for his actions, and many are afraid that once the building is demolished, Freudenheim's charges of neglect will be abolished. According to \"WGRZ Channel 2 News,\" in the past three months, Freudenheim has received at least five housing code violations from the city. \"WGRZ\" states that the orders, which they obtained, were to fix the building \"to a safe condition.\"\nFreudenheim gave the city permission to demolish the building on Thursday June 12 during an emergency Preservation Board meeting, because he would not be \"rehabilitating the building anytime soon.\" Freudenheim, along with his wife Nina, were part-owners of the Hotel Lenox at 140 North Street in Buffalo and were advocates to stop the Elmwood Village Hotel from being built on the corners of Forest and Elmwood Avenues in 2006 and 2007, which Wikinews extensively covered.

These chemicals, responsible for the characteristic smell of new vinyl, may cause damage to kidneys, the liver and the central nervous systems, respiratory problems, nausea, headaches and loss off coordination, according to the report.\nThese vinyl curtains are also said to contain traces of metals like lead, cadmium and mercury.\nJennifer Foulds of Environmental Defence advises consumers to seek alternatives to new vinyl products such as shower curtains and table cloths. Older products are thought to be safe, as they have already released most of the allegedly dangerous chemicals.\nCritics of the study have called it \"fear-mongering\", and some health professionals agree that the risk is being overblown. Warren Foster, a professor in the obstetrics and gynecology department at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario points out that, \"the difference between hazard and risk is great, and without knowing the actual human exposure, it's premature to make any judgement.\"\nFoster further commented that the study was not performed in a rigorous manner by not having controls or random sampling.\nFive brands of shower curtain were examined in the study; they were purchased from American stores including Bed Bath &amp; Beyond, Kmart, Sears, Target and Wal-Mart.

The flooding in Iowa has resulted in damage to buildings, infrastructure and farms, and governor Chet Culver's office has estimated that 36,000 people have been made homeless.\nResidents of Cedar Rapids, Iowa, who had begun returning to their homes to inspect damage and salvage belongings, wade through ankle-deep water that has picked up refuse from farms, sewage, and other noxious chemicals. LeRoy Rippert, chairman of emergency management and homeland security in Des Moines County, was concerned for residents, saying \"It is very, very wise to stay out of it. It's as dangerous as anything\". Experts in biology and medicine also raised concerns over the floodwater contaminating rural wells and providing breeding grounds for mosquitos. \"For rural folks, it's going to be hard to know if their water's safe or not,\" said G.

In a paper published in \"Earth and Planetary Science Letters\" on June 15, the team documents an examination of molecules found in the Murchison meteorite, fragments of which landed near the village of Murchison, Victoria in Australia in 1969.\nPrevious studies had identified amino acids and sugars in the meteorite that were believed to have formed in space. The samples the current study examined included molecules of uracil and xanthine, which belong to the class of nucleobases - chemicals which, when combined with sugars, form a crucial part of DNA and RNA. These molecules contained a form of carbon, known as carbon 13, in much higher concentrations than would be expected if they had come from contamination through exposure from Earth sources. The study, using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) imaging, had not been undertaken before due to its laborious and time-consuming nature - the low concentration of nucleobases in the meteorite meant that 15 grams of space rock had to be processed to get a large enough sample, compared to the milligrams required for previous studies.\nCo-author Dr Zita Martins, a chemist and astrobiologist from Imperial College London, believes their findings suggest that some of the chemicals that generated life on Earth came from meteorite bombardments. \"We are not saying that only meteorites contributed to the building blocks of life,\" she said, \"but it's a very great contribution.\" Other scientists, however, do not believe that meteoritic chemicals played such a significant role. According to Emeritus Professor Robert Shapiro of New York University, \"They're a subunit of a subunit of DNA. My opinion is that their amounts were utterly unimportant and insignificant.\"\n\"Wikinews\" contacted Professor Paul Davies, a physicist and astrobiologist presently at Arizona State University, about the recent findings. While he agreed with the findings, he said that he thinks such discoveries are \"a red herring in the origin of life story - a hangover from the Miller-Urey experiment. Life is all about information - its replication and processing.\""}

The takedown notices were received by email on June 10, he said. This, in and of itself, constitutes an improper filing. The letter of the law requires that a DMCA notice be sent to the appropriate party by recorded postal delivery.\nCadenhead remains unaware of any other bloggers who have been similarly notified, and says receiving seven takedown notices left him \"dumbfounded\". Previous Drudge Retort interaction with AP's legal team had seen AP complain about people posting entire reports in the comments section of the site. These were quickly removed and users warned that this was inappropriate and indisputably a copyright violation, says Cadenhead.\nCadenhead goes on to discuss how blogs, and other social networking sites, are of benefit to mainstream media such as AP. He describes how the posting of excerpts and quotes helps drive visitors to the sites where the full article text can be found, \"MSNBC publishes its news videos with an \"embed\" button that makes it possible to share them on blogs. If NBC sees the value of that, print-based media should recognize the benefits of encouraging the link-and-excerpt culture of bloggers. I heard on NPR yesterday that 20 percent of the New York Times web traffic is referred by blogs.\"\nThere may be a longer-term strategy behind these actions from the Associated Press. A report on ChannelWeb indicates that AP wants to charge for excerpts of their online content. The pricing schedule reported on this site starts at US$12.50 for quoting five to twenty-five words and goes up to US$100.00 for over 251 words. This, a challenge to the very existence of fair use, is to be managed by the company operating as a copyright protection service. goes into this in some depth on the site, commenting that those who inform on violators may receive up to one million dollar rewards. In addition, the \"no disparagement\" clause is highlighted, whereby AP reserves the right to revoke the license where they are unhappy with the usage.\n\"Welcome to a world in which you won\u2019t be able to effectively criticize the press, because you\u2019ll be required to pay to quote as few as five words from what they publish,\" Doctorow wrote.\nThe controversy provoked by these moves from AP, apparently, prompted them to schedule a meeting with the Media Bloggers Association to hammer out a set of guidelines.\nThe Associated Press case seems to rely on the 1918 U.S. Supreme Court case, where, following INS being prevented from using allied telegraph lines following unfavourable reporting, they used AP reports as a source to rewrite in their own words. With one vigorously dissenting justice, the case was closed in AP's favour, with the INS usage described as \"misappropriation\". Today sees a similar battle played out where bloggers and other citizen journalists simply do not have the resources to place their own reporters at the scene and must excerpt or rewrite from sources such as AP.\nAccording to Michael Kwun, a senior staff attorney with the EFF, one of their blog entries describes the action as biting the hand that feeds them. Kwun questioned whether the 1918 ruling could still be considered \"good law\", that changes in Federal law likely rendered it inapplicable, and that there was only a small chance that at state level this could still be applied.\nDespite several attempts to get input from the Associated Press, they had not responded to \"Wikinews\" at time of publication. Attempts to contact Reuters and the BBC for input also went unanswered.\nOn June 20, Cadenhead released a statement saying that after receiving additional information from AP, he is \"glad\" the dispute is over. AP said it had a \"constructive exchange\" with a \"number of interested parties in the blogging community\" and will seek to continue dialogue.\n\"I think it would be helpful for bloggers and users of social news sites to know what the AP believes to be fair use of their copyrighted work,\" said Wade Duchene, attorney for Cadenhead. \"I hope that any guidelines that are issued are not interpreted as an agreed definition of fair use.\""}

Pelosi has often been criticized for her absence from the district she represents. Sheehan provided an understanding of local issues, including the recent Hunter's Point controversy, reiterating her commitment to \"affordable housing, better mass transit, alleviating traffic, dependence on fossil fuels, [and] rent control.\"\nOn the 9/11 World Trade Center attacks, Sheehan said, \"I've never said it's been an inside job, I'm not convinced of that,\" but asserted that there are questions about the attacks that still need to be answered that only an independent, thorough investigation could provide. \nSheehan is receiving support from independent presidential candidate Ralph Nader and expected Green Party candidate Cynthia McKinney. When asked whom she would endorse for president, Sheehan replied, \"It's a tossup between Ralph and Cynthia.\"\nCindy Sheehan is still collecting the signatures needed to get on the ballot by the July filing date, but is expected to gain a substantial amount at the Gay Pride celebrations in the upcoming weeks. Sheehan is not running as a Green Party candidate, and has the endorsement of the local Peace and Freedom Party. \nAlso present was Barry Hermason, Green Party candidate for California's 12th district, which includes most of the south-west quarter of San Francisco."}

At least two homes remain evacuated.\nBurns orders that both the city and the group \"Save The Livery\" (www.savethelivery.com) have to come to an agreement on what to do with the building, and try to work out ways of saving at least some portions if it including the facade, side walls and a lift tower. \"Save The Livery\" is comprised of concerned area residents who have grown to love the building's historic and unique character. On June 14, they won a temporary restraining order to stop demolition. The court ruled that the city was only allowed to remove material in immediate danger to residents and pedestrians, but stated that the demolition could only be performed with \"hand tools.\" The court also ordered that any rubble which had fallen into neighboring yards when the building collapsed, to be removed.\n\"It is in the interest of the city to have a safe environment--but also important to maintain a sense of historical preservation,\" stated Burns in his ruling. Burns has given the sides until tomorrow (Friday June 20) to come to an agreement and has ordered both parties to return to court at 9:30 a.m. (eastern time) \"sharp.\" Activists of \"Save The Livery\" urge supporters of the stable to \"fill the courtroom\" to show \"continued and ongoing support.\" The hearing is scheduled to take place at 25 Delaware Avenue in the Supreme Court building, 3rd Floor, trial part 19.\nCurrently the building is owned by Bob Freudenheim who has several building violations against him because of the buildings poor condition. He has received at least five violations in three months and residents who live near the building state that Freudenheim should be \"100% responsible\" for his actions. Many are afraid that if the building is demolished, Freudenheim's charges of neglect will be abolished.\nOn June 17, developer and CEO of Savarino Companies, Sam Savarino was at the site of the stable, discussing the building with residents and preservationists. In 2006, Savarino proposed and planned \"The Elmwood Village Hotel\", a 'botique' hotel on the Southeast corner of Elmwood and Forest Avenues. The project was later withdrawn after residents filed a lawsuit against Savarino and the city. \"Wikinews\" extensively covered the story, and contacted Savarino for his professional opinion on the building.\n\"[I would] love to see it preserved. I was there to see if there was anything we could do to help, to see if anything can be salvaged. I just want to see the right thing happen, and so does the city,\" stated Savarino to \"Wikinews\" who added that he was allowed inside the building for a brief period.\n\"The side walls are beyond repair. The roof has rotted and it could come down at any time,\" added Savarino who also said that the building \"below the second floor appears to be stable.\" He also states that the back wall of the building, which borders several homes, appears to be intact.\n\"Eliminating the back wall could be a problem for the neighbors. It is not unreasonable to leave at least 12 feet\" of the back wall standing, added Savarino.\nSavarino did not say if he was interested in buying the property, but did state, \"I am sure there are a couple of people interested\" in buying the property. On Thursday, \"Buffalo News\" reported that a \"businessman\" might be interested in purchasing the property, though \"Wikinews\" is not able to independently confirm the report. Savarino says that with the property still slated for emergency demolition, a potential buyer could face tax fees of nearly US$300,000.\nFreudenheim gave the city permission to demolish the building on Thursday June 12 during an emergency Preservation Board meeting, because he would not be \"rehabilitating the building anytime soon.\" Freudenheim, along with his wife Nina, were part-owners of the Hotel Lenox at 140 North Street in Buffalo and were advocates to stop the Elmwood Village Hotel. They also financially supported a lawsuit in an attempt to stop the hotel from being built. Though it is not known exactly how long Freudenheim has owned the stable, \"Wikinews\" has learned that he was the owner while fighting to stop the hotel from being built. Residents say that he has been the owner for at least 22 years.\nThe building was first owned by a company called \"White Bros.\" and was used as a stable for a farm which once covered the land around the building for several blocks. The Buffalo Fire Department believes the building was built around 1814, while the city property database states it was built in 1870. Servants and workers of the farm were housed inside resident quarters situated at the rear of the building on what is now Summer Street, but are now cottages where area residents currently reside. Some date as far back as 1829.\nAt about 1950, the stable was converted into an automobile body shop and gasoline station.A property record search showed that in 1950 at least four fuel storage tanks were installed on the property. Two are listed as 550 square feet while the other two are 2,000 square feet. All of the tanks are designated as a TK4, which New York State says is used for \"below ground horizontal bulk fuel storage.\" The cost of installing a tank of that nature according to the state, at that time, included the tank itself, \"excavation and backfill,\" but did not include \"the piping, ballast, or hold-down slab orring.\" It is not known if the tanks are still on the property, but residents are concerned the city was not taking the precautions to find out.

In his address to the court, Mann named several others involved in the plot including Mark Thatcher, son of former UK Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, and Chelsea-based Lebanese billionaire Ely Calil, whom Mann alleges was one of the major players.\nThe planned coup was allegedly plotted and bankrolled by a group of influential figures, including Calil, in an attempt to put self-declared opposition leader Severo Moto \u2014 currently living in exile in Madrid, Spain \u2014 in power and claim the profits from de facto ownership of the country's oil reserves. Mann, who had run mercenaries in civil conflicts in other African countries, claims Calil convinced him to run the operation through financial and moral incentives. \"They knew I would be sympathetic to the story they told about the oil money not getting to the people,\" he told the court. Mann claimed that he was told the coup was supported by South Africa, Spain and the United States, as well as several unnamed oil companies, and that the conspirators included several members of Nguema's own parliament who kept watch of his movements.\nMann was arrested in Zimbabwe at Harare airport in 2004 on the way to Equatorial Guinea along with 61 alleged accomplices. He was found guilty of attempting to buy arms for the alleged coup plot, and sentenced to seven years' prison in Zimbabwe. In May 2007 a Zimbabwe judge court ruled for him to be extradited to Equatorial Guinea.

Mayor Carolyn Kirk called it a \"blip\" in the pregnancy rate and noted many factors playing into it, such glamorization of teen pregnancy including the announcement around the same time that Britney Spear's sister, Jamie Lynn Spears had given birth to a baby, and last year's critically acclaimed movie, \"Juno\", a comedy about a 16-year-old girl who gets pregnant and other movies, such as \"Knocked Up\".\nThere is some concern over what might be statutory rape, as it has been reported that most of the men who are the fathers are older, including one report that one of the fathers is a 24-year-old homeless man. In Massachusetts, the age of consent is 16, therefore it is illegal for anyone to have sexual intercourse with anyone under 16.\nOther teen mothers however have criticized the new mothers. Two such girls are Alivia Fidler and Meaghan Orlando, childhood friends and sophomore students at the high school, the girls were 16 years old when they became pregnant unexpectedly.\nOrlando noted, \"If I could go back in time I would want to wait and have the same baby later.

You have to take care of your baby. It's frustrating. I don't have a lot of support.\" Fidler is no longer with the father of the baby, 5 month-old Xavier Fidler-Aguiar and recently lost her job at McDonalds.\nOne other teen mother, Amanda Ireland, who recently graduated from the school, also gave a warning to the mothers, \"Don't try to get pregnant. People say they know what it's like because they have younger siblings, but they really have no idea.\"\nIreland also noted, \"They're so excited to finally have someone to love them unconditionally. I try to explain it's hard to feel loved when an infant is screaming to be fed at 3 a.m.\" \n46 year-old Gloucester resident Lori Mitchell, whose daughter dropped out of high school at 16 to raise a child said there are worse things than being a teenage mother, \"They could be junkies or prostitutes. You try to protect them as much as you can, but it's up to them to do the right thing.\"\nGreg Verga, the chairman of the Gloucester School Committee called the pact, \"disturbing\", as he himself was once a teen father.\n\"They are going to have a rude awakening. It was no picnic. People don\u2019t realize there\u2019s 3 a.m. feedings ... it\u2019s a lifestyle change. It\u2019s not a possession you can play with and stick on the shelf.

However, its leader, Lyn Allison, has confirmed talks with other small political parties such as the Climate Change Coalition with the aim of forming a new political entity.\nThe Democrats have held seats in the Senate for 31 years, and operated under the mission statement \"to keep the bastards honest\" as coined by former leader Don Chipp in 1980. Its loss of three Senate seats in 2004 was instrumental in giving the Liberal/National Coalition an absolute Senate majority in addition to their existing majority in the House of Representatives, which allowed them to pass legislation without the need of minority or Independent Senate votes. In the 2007 election, two of the four remaining Democrat senators chose not to stand for re-election, and the other two lost their seat. However, a swing against the Coalition gives the balance of power to minorities - the Greens, Family First, and Independent senator Nick Xenaphon.\nSenator Allison predicted that tensions between the Labor Party - who won a majority in the House of Representatives in the election - and the Greens would result in a double dissolution election. Under Section 57 of the Australian Constitution, if the Senate rejects the same legislation passed up from the House of Representatives twice under certain conditions, the Govenor-General may dissolve both Houses, resulting in elections for all seats. There have been six double dissolutions in Australian parliament, with the most recent in 1987.\nSenator Allison said \"any Bill which the opposition opposes will require the votes of all five Greens, plus the new senator Xenophon and [Family First] Senator Fielding. Now that's quite a disparate bunch.\" Of the possibility of forming a new minority party, she said that she thinks \"there is a place for the Australian Democrats or a party just like it and we want to still be part of that.\" A double dissolution \"would of course be an ideal election to contest as a new entity,\" she said, but noted that it would probably not retain the Democrats name, since it \"has not attracted any votes.\"\nThe new party would not include the Greens, but its leader, Bob Brown, was supportive of plans for a new political entity in Federal politics, as more voices in the Senate would be better for democracy. \"I think it's a great idea\", he said."}

Flight Safety has now announced that they have found Yogyakarta International had been granted a five year license but this would be withdrawn after twelve months if several conditions were not met. Since these conditions remained unchanged, the license effectively voided six months before the disaster, claim Flight Safety. One of the conditions was extension of the runway and provision of an adequate Runway End Safety Area (RESA). \nThe group adds that it also conducted checks on Solo International Airport and Semarang International Airport, and that these airports also had invalid Airport Operating Certificates. The final report was not released at the time as the client in question felt it 'too sensitive', and Flight Safety says that it was rapidly covered up three months later when it leaked in Indonesia.\nThe group says it notified the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), and that they in turn said the Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) - who assisted in the crash investigation - was in control of the situation. However, Flight Safety claim that when approached, the ATSB denied knowing about it. Allegedly, the ATSB had missed the licensing discrepancy because they only checked the front page of the airport's license and did not conduct a detailed analysis of the small print.\nFlight Safety claim that the Indonesian Director of Aviation Safety told them that the situation had been rectified. However, the group have now conducted a re-audit and say Solo and Yogyakarta airports both remain illegal. They go on to accuse the ICAO, ATSB and Indonesian Director of Aviation Safety of \"keeping quiet\" and described them as 'compromised'.\nFlight Safety go on to claim that the survivors of the crash and relatives of the deceased have not been informed either, and say that this will have a serious effect on the compensation process and on any insurance claims. \"Crikey\", an Australian news service, also suggested that AU$12 million of aid promised by Australia to help Indonesia improve air safety is also being misused. All Indonesia's air carriers are currently on the list of air carriers banned in the EU.\nAn official statement by Flight Safety head Chris Weir concluded \"It [the group's findings] should now be exposed as the safety issues remain unresolved.\"\nMardjono Siswo Suwarno of the National Transport Safety Committee, the body responsible for investigating the disaster, denied that Yogyakarta Airport was illegal, saying \"At that time [the license] was still valid, but the RESA was not long enough... But still in the [Garuda] case, even if the RESA length was adequate, the plane would have still overrun because the speed was 1.8 times normal speed.\"\nThe final report found that the pilot-in-command, who has been arrested and charged over the crash, attempted to land after fifteen Ground Proximity Warning System activations to tell him he was landing too fast, and says that although a longer runway and full-sized RESA wouldn't have stopped an airliner traveling at such excessive speed it could have reduced the toll of deaths and injuries.\nThe directors of Yogyakarta and Solo airports claim that since the re-audit they have taken steps to improve safety and rectify any problems, but have not actually admitted their airports were illegal. Indonesian director general of air transportation Budi Mulyawan Suyitno said that although local budget limitations have prevented some airports from being improved there are no problems currently at Yogyakarta, with improvements including declaration of a RESA for 140 metres of the 2,250 metre runway and stationing Aircraft Rescue and Firefighting trucks at the airport.\nSources.\n "}

Despite the frustration from residents, the city is planning on suing the building's owner. A rally was held at the stable's site where residents are hoping to bring more awareness to the situation and gain more support to save the building.\nOn June 11, a significant portion of the stable's right side wall collapsed into the yard of a resident's home. Authorities, including the Buffalo Fire Department were called to the scene to evaluate the collapse and evacuate 15 homes of residents surrounding the stable as a precautionary measure. The following day, the city ordered an emergency demolition on the building, which was stopped by a restraining order residents with \"Save The Livery\" (www.savethelivery.com) won on June 14. Two weeks later, five homes are still evacuated and residents don't know when they will be able to return.\nOn June 19, Judge Justice Christopher Burns of the New York State Supreme Court ordered a halt to the emergency demolition and ordered the city and residents to come to an agreement to save the building, or at least a significant portion of it. Despite a court date today, no agreement has yet been reached between the two parties.\n\"It is in the interest of the city to have a safe environment--but also important to maintain a sense of historical preservation,\" stated Burns in his June 19th ruling. The court ruled that a limited demolition could take place and that the city was only allowed to remove material in immediate danger to residents and pedestrians, but stated that the demolition could only be performed with \"hand tools.\" The court also ordered that any rubble which had fallen into neighboring yards when the building collapsed, to be removed. Since then, most of not all the significantly damaged portions of the building or portions in immediate danger of falling have been demolished. The roof has also been removed to put less stress on the stable's walls.\n\"Its been over three years since we have been having problems with part of the livery falling down. There was an implosion two weeks ago and suddenly the city wanted to have an emergency demolition,\" said Catherine Herrick who lives on Summer Street immediately behind the stable and is the main plaintiff in the lawsuit against the city. Many homes on Summer are small cottages which were used as servants quarters when the stable was in operation, many of which were built in the 1820's. At least seven homes on Summer border the stable's back walls. Residents in those homes have significant gardens which have been planted against the building and growing for decades.\n\"Both parties are to continue to work together to see how we can meet everybody's needs. This is the third time we have been in that courtroom, and that is what we were basically told to do,\" added Herrick who said the rally was held today because this \"is Buffalo's history. Buffalo is a wonderful place to live because of its history and this is a historical, beautiful building and we need to keep those beautiful buildings.\"\nHerrick states that the city is working with residents, but also believes that its \"slow moving\" and they are allowing the owner to get away with neglect on the property.\n\"I believe right now that they are letting the owner get off. The owner was negligent for 20 years, and hasn't done anything to it despite what he has claimed to say. Now that this is an emergency situation, the city has a lot to say about it,\" added Herrick.\nCurrently the building is owned by Bob Freudenheim who has several building violations against him because its poor condition. He has received at least five violations in three months and residents who live near the building state that Freudenheim should be \"100% responsible\" for his actions. \nFreudenheim gave the city permission to demolish the building on June 12 during an emergency Preservation Board meeting, because he would not be \"rehabilitating the building anytime soon.\" Freudenheim, along with his wife Nina, were part-owners of the Hotel Lenox at 140 North Street in Buffalo and were advocates to stop the Elmwood Village Hotel from being built on the Southeast corner of Forest and Elmwood Avenues. They also financially supported a lawsuit in an attempt to stop the hotel from being built. Though it is not known exactly how long Freudenheim has owned the stable, \"Wikinews\" has learned that he was the owner while fighting to stop the hotel from being built. Residents say that he has been the owner for at least 22 years. Attorneys for Freudenheim confirm that the city is starting proceedings against him for his violations beginning as early as Wednesday June 25. Freudenheim has not released a statement and could not be reached for comment.\nMany residents want the building preserved and Herrick states that their engineer can have it stable in \"four days\" as opposed to the 14-30 days it would take to demolish the building and \"at a lesser cost than what it costs to demolish it.\"\nIt will cost the city nearly US$300,000 to demolish the building which is paid for with tax money collected from residents in the city. The \"Buffalo News\" reports that fees are approaching $700,000. Though reports say there is a potential buyer of the stable, \"Wikinews\" cannot independently confirm those reports.\nResidents say the stable was designed by Richard A. Waite, a 19th century architect, and was first owned by a company called \"White Bros.\", used as a stable and housed at least 30 horses at any given time. It also stored \"coaches, coupes, broughams, Victorias and everything in the line of light livery,\" stated an article from the \"West Side Topics\" dated 1906. According to the article, The company first opened in 1881 on Thirteenth Street, now Normal Avenue, and later moved into the Jersey building in 1892. The Buffalo Fire Department believes the building was built around 1814, while the city property database states it was built in 1870. It is believed to be only one of three stables of this kind still standing in the country.\nAt about 1950, the stable was converted into an automobile body shop and gasoline station.A property record search showed that in 1950 at least four fuel storage tanks were installed on the property. Two are listed as 550 square feet while the other two are 2,000 square feet. All of the tanks are designated as a TK4, which New York State says is used for \"below ground horizontal bulk fuel storage.\" The cost of installing a tank of that nature according to the state, at that time, included the tank itself, \"excavation and backfill,\" but did not include \"the piping, ballast, or hold-down slab orring.\" It is not known if the tanks are still on the property, but residents are concerned the city was not taking the precautions to find out.\n\"Wikinews\" has called the city along with the Mayor's office several times, but both have yet to return our calls. There are conflicting reports as to the date of the next hearing. According to Herrick, the next hearing is July 1, 2008 though the Buffalo News states the next hearing is July 8. The News also states that Burns will make a final ruling on the stable at this time."}

Worldwide media was quick to publish the story and the accompanying photographs taken by Jos\u00e9 Carlos Meirelles. The photos showed people in full body paint aiming bows at the overhead aircraft from which the pictures were taken. \"Wikinews\" covered the story as well.\nIn its Sunday edition, British newspaper \"The Observer\" had a story called \"Secret of the 'lost' tribe that wasn't\" which was about this \"discovery\" and revealed that the tribe had in fact been known to scientists, including Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Nacional do \u00cdndio (FUNAI), the Brazilian protection agency for Indian interests.\nAfter this revelation, media newswires branded the original story a hoax. These hoax claims spread nearly as quickly as the original story. Rapidly, news sites even claimed that the photos were fake. The true story, however, is more complicated than that.\n\"The Observer\"'s article featured an interview with Jos\u00e9 Carlos Meirelles, one of a handful so-called \"sertanistas\" that work for the FUNAI. These are field agents that map the areas of uncontacted indigenous peoples, so that their habitat can be protected. He admitted that his desire to protect these tribes had caused him to overstep his mission.\nWhen given the use of an aircraft to seek out new tribes, Meirelles instead flew over an area where he knew a tribe had been observed decades ago. Ultimately, he was hoping to prove that FUNAI's policy of not contacting the tribes they observe is better for the tribes. With this flight he hoped to find evidence that the tribe, discovered long ago, was better off for not being contacted.\n\"When I saw them painted red, I was satisfied, I was happy,\" he said. \"Because painted red means they are ready for war, which to me says they are happy and healthy defending their territory.\"\nThe photos are of a real tribe, long known to Meirelles and other scientists within FUNAI, but protected under Brazilian law.\nMeirelles says he has no regrets, because he just wanted to prove these kind of tribes exist and deserve protection. He said that Peruvian President Alan Garc\u00eda had claimed that these tribes were imaginary and that he needed to prove they existed. In doing so, he violated FUNAI policies by flying over their area and taking pictures. Both are prohibited. Meirelles claims he will protect the exact location of the tribe's territory, even if tortured.\nFormer president of FUNAI, Sydney Possuelo, agreed that the publication of the photos was necessary to quell the doubt about the very existence such uncontacted indigenous peoples.\nSurvival International, a human rights organisation formed in 1969 that campaigns for the rights of indigenous tribal and uncontacted peoples, admits complicity in the distribution of the original story. Survival International was instrumental in getting the original story international attention.\nNevertheless, Survival International said it did not mislead media because it never described the tribe as \"lost\".\n\"These Indians are in a reserve expressly set aside for the protection of uncontacted tribes: they were hardly 'unknown',\" said Stephen Corry, director of Survival International in a statement. \"What is, and remains, true, is that so far as is known these Indians have no peaceful contact with outsiders.\"\n\"Some of the media got very carried away and started talking about undiscovered tribes,\" explains Fiona Watson of Survival International. \"There was this interpretation that this was a completely new tribe, completely undiscovered, without bothering to check with sources ... Neither the Brazilian government nor Survival has ever used that word, and 'uncontacted' means they don't have any contact with outsiders.\""}

Terms of the agreement stated that the purchase would be completed within 75 days, but that U.S. Sugar would be able to operate for another six years. After that, the state of Florida will retain ownership of U.S. Sugar's manufacturing facilities in Clewiston, Florida, and 187,000 acres of fields that have grown sugarcane since the 1960s will be allowed to return to their natural state.\nU.S. Sugar and the state of Florida have been in legal disputes since the Everglades Forever Act was passed in 1994. The act was an attempt to clean up water tainted with phosphorus, a component of fertilizer, which runs off the sugarcane fields and into the Everglades.\nPhosphorus alters Everglades ecosystems, allowing invasive and exotic cattails to replace sawgrass when levels rise above 50 parts per billion (ppb). Tests in the 1980s in the Loxahatchee National Wildlife Refuge directly south of sugarcane fields indicated that the water had 500 ppb of phosphorus."}

While average life expectancy is 81.4 years, second only to Japan's 82.2, and rates of cancer, heart disease and stroke are dropping, incidence of obesity, alcohol-related diseases, and sexually transmitted infections are on the increase.\nThe AIHW report highlighted the increasing gap between Australia's Indigenous population and the rest of the nation. Australian Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders have a life expectancy around 17 years lower than the general populace, and in at least four states 71% of Aboriginals who died were under 65-years old, compared with 21% for the rest of the population. Indigenous Australians are reported to have higher rates of obesity, diabetes, respiratory illness, teenage pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections. People living in rural and regional areas were also found to have lower life expectancies and higher illness rates than their suburban and metropolitan counterparts.\nWhile obesity is a growing concern in Australia, AIHW director Penny Allbon expressed skepticism over a recent report from the Baker IDI Heart and Diabetes Institute that claimed that Australia had overtaken the United States as the \"fattest\" nation in the world, with \"over four million adult Australians [...] currently obese\". Allben commented that the institute's sample from 100 locations across the country may not be representative of the whole population. \"At the moment the ABS [Australian Bureau of Statistics] is out there measuring height and weight in a population-based survey, so we don't know the results,\" Dr Allbon said. \"We were just a bit concerned that the statistics that came out about us being the fattest in the world is not based on a population survey.\" AIHW reported the number of Australians being obese as closer to 2.5 million, with 7.4 million being overweight.\nBetween 1997 and 2005, the number of general practitioners in Australia has dropped 9%, although in regional areas there has been an increase of 15%.\nBased on the report, the AIHW has recommended that Australians consider lifestyle change, such as healthier eating and more exercise, to alleviate the pressure on Australia's public health system. \"In rank order, the greatest improvements can be achieved through reductions in tobacco smoking, high blood pressure, overweight/obesity, physical inactivity, high blood cholesterol and excessive alcohol consumption,\" according to Dr. Allbon."}

Louisiana\", Patrick Kennedy of New Orleans, Louisiana was convicted of raping his eight-year old stepdaughter, and was sentenced to death for the crime. A Louisiana law adopted in 1995 allowed the death penalty for those who had raped a child under 12 years old (later amended to 13). Five other states have similar laws, while the remaining states ban the death penalty for rape. The last execution for rape in America occurred in 1964.\nThe Louisiana Supreme Court defended Kennedy's sentence, saying that \"short of first-degree murder, we can think of no other non-homicide crime more deserving\" of the death penalty. Kennedy, who was one of two criminals on death row in America who did not commit murder, challenged the court's decision, and the case was brought to the U.S. Supreme Court.\nWriting for the majority, Justice Anthony Kennedy said the Constitution did not allow the death penalty where the crime did not result, and was not intended to result, in a person's death. He noted exceptions in cases of crimes against the state, such as treason and espionage. Despite \"the years of long anguish that must be endured by the victim of child rape,\" Justice Kennedy wrote, \"the death penalty should not be expanded to instances where the victim's life was not taken.\" He added, \"When the law punishes by death, it risks its own sudden descent into brutality, transgressing the constitutional commitment to decency and restraint.\"\nThe four liberal-leaning justices (Stevens, Souter, Ginsburg and Breyer) joined Kennedy, a moderate who often casts the deciding vote in close cases. The four conservative-leaning justices (Roberts, Scalia, Thomas and Alito) dissented. \nSamuel Alito wrote in his dissent, \"The harm that is caused to the victims and to society at large by the worst child rapists is grave... It is the judgment of the Louisiana lawmakers and those in an increasing number of other states that these harms justify the death penalty.\" Alito said the decision would bar the death penalty \"no matter how young the child, no matter how many times the child is raped, no matter how many children the perpetrator rapes, no matter how sadistic the crime, no matter how much physical or psychological trauma is inflicted, and no matter how heinous the perpetrator's prior criminal record may be.\"\nLouisiana governor Bobby Jindal also criticized the court's decision. \"One thing is clear: The five members of the court who issued the opinion do not share the same 'standards of decency' as the people of Louisiana,\" Jindal said."}

They noted that while the defence had presented a \"no harm-no foul argument\", in which it was argued that the accused were owed the money appropriated, \"such arguments usually fare badly in criminal cases\". They also dismissed claims that instructions given to the jury by the judge had been incomplete, or unclear, stating that \"the defendants proposed a misleading statement as an alternative\", and that in such situations the judge is allowed to stay with the original instruction, and in particular is not required \"that a submitted charge be technically perfect to alert the court to the need for a particular charge\".\nThe appeals judges also discounted arguments from the defence regarding the defendants being unaware of the illegality of the transactions, making reference to an \"ostrich argument\", based on the urban legend that sensing danger stick their heads in the sand.

The February industrial disaster killed 13 people when the Imperial Sugar refinery at Port Wentworth, United States exploded.\nThe initial investigation concluded the disaster to have been a dust explosion that ignited under the silos, but investigators from the U.S. Chemical Safety Board (CSB) and the Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA) have been hampered as OSHA declared them to be unsafe after the accident.\nA 7,000lb wrecking ball has now been brought in and demolished the structures, which were 18 inches thick. This will allow access for investigators, and make way for replacement silos and a new sugar packaging building, which are scheduled to be in place by Summer 2009. The refinery hopes to restart sugar processing by the end of the year.\nImperial vice president Brian Harrison, who is overseeing reconstruction at the site, said of the move \"Several people have indicated to me it's a passage from the old to the new and a significant sign of the progress we're making to rebuild.\"\n2.8 million pounds of fire-hardened sugar were still present in one silo, and 500,000 pounds in another. Imperial brought in a crane with a bucket to retrive this and intends to recycle it for ethanol production.\nFour workers are still hospitalised after the explosion, three in critical condition.

Details of the failed privatisation were released by the BBC following a freedom of information request, and prior to publication of its annual report on July 8.\nFourteen months after advisers were appointed to try to sell BBC Resources Ltd., only one of the three main business units has been sold \u2014 its Outside Broadcast division to Satellite Information Services Limited (SIS), for an estimated \u00a320m. On March 7, 2008 it was also announced that the studios operation would remain in BBC ownership and in early June, the fate of the third business was put on hold with the BBC stating that \"like Studios, Post Production will remain within BBC Resources, which will continue to operate as a wholly-owned commercial subsidiary of the BBC.\"\nBBC Resources Ltd. made an operating profit of \u00a36.1m for 2005-06, down from \u00a37.4m the year before, with the BBC accounting for 83.3% of its turnover, down from 87.4% for 2004-05.

It does not own any studios or premises, its assets being staff and equipment. \nBBC Resources was the first of the BBC's commercial divisions to be set up as a limited company and the last to be sold, the BBC having previously divested itself of BBC Technology and BBC Broadcast, although BBC Enterprises \u2014 now known as BBC Worldwide \u2014 remained in-house.\nIt had been intended to float Resources back in 2005, but this was postponed for two years following strike action and ACAS talks in June 2005 \u2014 the BBC giving an undertaking that there would be no preparations made to sell the company until January 2007, and no sale allowed before July 2007.\nAdvertised for sale on August 16, 2007 in the \"Financial Times\", \"The Times\" and \"Broadcast\", the disposal \u2014 led by Ernst &amp; Young \u2014 invited expressions of interest for the whole division or for each of its three operations separately.\nOn October 18, 2007, Director General Mark Thompson confirmed that Television Centre, the home of BBC Studios and Post Production, would be sold \"by the end the financial year 2012/13\" with a BBC spokeswoman adding that \"this is a full scale disposal of BBC Television Centre and we won't be leasing it back\".\nOn April 1, 2008, BBC Outside Broadcasts was transferred into SIS ownership.\nBBC Costume and Wigs.\nThis was the second largest collection of its kind in the UK, after the leading suppliers Angels The Costumiers. It was not included in the privatisation, and in early October 2007 it was announced that the business was to close within six months and the entire stock sold as a complete collection.\nBBC Costume and Wigs (part of BBC Studios) ceased trading on February 14, 2008 after failed attempts to sell this business unit as a going concern with a BBC spokeswoman saying that \"the arrangements [the corporation] was pursuing have not worked out and BBC Resources is currently inviting interested parties to consider making an offer to purchase.\"\nOn March 30 the costume collection \u2014 consisting of over 1 million items \u2014 was sold to Angels and the collection of wigs and hairpieces was sold separately to The Wig Store (a management buy-out put together by Philippa Devon and Alan Godleman)."}

He said, \"the North Pole is just another point in the globe, but it does have this symbolic meaning. There's supposed to be ice at the North Pole. The fact that we may not have any by the end of this summer could be quite a symbolic change.\"\nThe scenario of an ice-less Arctic has been seen as far back as five years ago but the rate of melting was not expected to happen in a matter of five years.\nSerreze also corrected those saying that the melting of Arctic ice is just part of a \"historic cycle.\"\nHe adds that as far back as 30 years ago, their earliest climate models have suggested that the very first sign of an impact from global warming would have been the melting of Arctic ice.\nTheir studies also reveal that the ice could return given conditions wherein the planet will cool down."}

The initiative which comes under his \"Laureus Sport for Good Foundation\" and involves physicists, mathematicians and electronic engineers from the University of Manchester and Lancaster University. In addition the Mines Advisory Group, a mine clearance charity, and the security systems company Rapiscan are involved.\nCharlton first became interested in the problem of clearing anti-personnel landmines while visiting Bosnia on a Laureus funded Spirit of Soccer camp. He was appalled by the injuries he saw, especially to children, caused by abandoned anti-personnel mines. Later his visited Cambodia where there are estimated to be four to six million mines. Charlton was told it would take 100 years to clear the mines.\nOn the way back to Manchester, passing through airport metal detectors, he thought that surely there must be a better way to detect landmines than the laborious method he had seen using only a metal detector and a bayonet. As the mines are made mainly of plastic and have only a small amount of metal every piece of metal including shrapnel must be investigated to see if it is a mine.\nHe contacted Rapiscan and through them the University of Manchester to see if there was anyone who could help. The University has a number of scientists and engineers with relevant experience, including a project EMBody to develop the next generation walk through metal detector, in collaboration with Rapiscan and Manchester Airport, and work on a scanning metal detector used to image steel reinforcing bars in concrete.\nOn June 12th a demonstration was arranged at a disused quarry where Sir Bobby and the Professors of Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Physics were shown the power of explosives. This included a demonstration where an explosive charge of about 50g of high explosive, about the same amount as a medium sized landmine, was placed under a sand-filled Wellington boot. The charge was detonated with a resounding bang that echoed around the quarry. The boot was projected tens of metres in the air. And when examined the toe had been cut off and the rubber shredded. The shock wave from the explosives thumped the chests of the scientists even at a safe distance. One commented that there was no chance of using delicate instrumentation anywhere near a possible explosion and they had to seek simple solutions.\n\"Last time I saw a boot fly through the air like that it was against Bolton\" said Charlton, but there was a sombre but excited mood as the scientists headed back to the University, buzzing with ideas."}

Bush today signed a bill providing $162 billion for the war efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan, which intends to fund the wars for the rest of Bush's term and well into the first year of the new President's term. \nIn addition to war funds, the bill includes educational benefits for young troops and veterans, a 13-week extension of unemployment benefits, $2.7 billion in emergency relief for victims of the Midwest floods, and billions of dollars for items such as international food aid, anti-drug enforcement, and repairs of Louisiana levees.\nAt a ceremony in the White House's Oval Office, Bush praised the legislation as a necessary product of bipartisanship. \"I appreciate that Republicans and Democrats in Congress agreed to provide these vital funds without tying the hands of our commanders, and without an artificial timetable of withdrawal from Iraq.\" Bush said. \"This bill shows the American people that even in an election year, Republicans and Democrats can come together to stand behind our troops and their families.\"\nAlthough not mentioned by Bush in his statement, the bill also waives an older law that restricted America's capacity to finance the removal of nuclear weapons in North Korea. \"The absence of the waiver could have led to an embarrassing situation where progress on dismantling North Korea's nuclear program would have been delayed because of a technicality,\" said Leonor Tomero of the Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation. North Korea was recently removed from a U.S. list of countries that sponsor terrorism, as a reward for turning over all documents relating to the country's nuclear program.\nFor months, the Democrats and Republicans in Congress had argued over the bill, forcing several compromises to be made in the form of amendments. One of these amendments, the Post-9/11 Veterans Educational Assistance Act of 2008, can be described as a modern version of the World War II-era G.I. Bill. It provides lower college tuition costs for war veterans, which was originally opposed by Bush and Senate Republicans, including Presidential candidate John McCain. The Republicans conceded after Democrats agreed to add \"transferability\" to the bill, which allows veterans to transfer the benefits to family members.\nSenate Democratic majority leader Harry Reid commented on the bill, saying, \"At a time when 2 million men and women have fought in Iraq and Afghanistan and when our troops have had to endure multiple deployments ... and an unclear strategy, giving them the opportunity to fuel our future economy is the least we can do.\"\nWith the passing of this bill, Congress has provided $650 billion for the Iraq War effort, and nearly $200 billion for war operations in Afghanistan."}

He even offered introductions to his friends living in Perth.\nUsher made the decision to sell his life after his five-year marriage suddenly ended. On his website, alife4sale.com, he explains that \"despite my life being busy and fulfilled, I still miss my wife so much. Everything in my home is a reminder of the wonderful past we shared. So, after a year in this house I decided that it is time to sell it and move on.\"\nDuring the 7 day auction, which ended on Sunday, there were several bogus bids which brought the sale price as high as A$2.2 million, but the final price ended up at A$399,300, which was around A$100,000 less than Usher had hoped for. \"I'm a little bit disappointed, but I'm still excited. It's still enough to move forward and do what I said I was going to do, which is move on to the next part of my life,\" Usher said. \"It was as much about moving on as it was about selling it for as much as I could get.\"\nAccording to Reuters, the winning bidder, whose username is \"mslmcc\", also lives in Australia, and has a 100 percent feedback rating. Usher says he hasn't yet been able to figure out who the buyer is, because of the TV crews lined up in front of his home. \"I'm trying to find some time to get on the computer and check it out ... I haven't looked (up) anything about them yet,\" he said.\nUsher now plans to go off in search of a new life. His initial plan, as he describes on his website, was to just walk out his front door with just his wallet and a passport and board a train, with no idea of where to go. He has since launched 100goals100weeks.com, which will document his attempt to complete 100 of his life goals in a span of 100 weeks. Some of these goals include getting a pilot's license, climbing the Eiffel Tower, learning to play the didgeridoo, and shaking hands with billionaire Richard Branson.\n\"I was pretty aimless when I started this, and I had a vague notion of adventure, but I've come up with a much more solid plan, which is still very adventurous,\" Usher says. He invites anyone who is interested to join him on his adventures."}

The probe was launched aboard Space Shuttle \"Discovery\", in October 1990. Following separation from \"Discovery\", Ulysses was boosted into a Heliocentric orbit by an Inertial Upper Stage, and a Payload Assist Module.\nUlysses was a joint venture between the European Space Agency (ESA), and the United States National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). Its primary mission was to study the Sun. It made several significant discoveries, including that the density of dust particles in the solar wind was over 30 times what scientists had expected, and that the solar magnetic field was weaker, and more complex, than expected.\nOver the last few years, the spacecraft has started to show its age, and several major systems have failed. When one of the high-band communications antenna was shut down to conserve power, technicians were unable to restart it, and from January onwards, the low-band antenna had to be used to relay all data to and from the probe. When the main power system started to fail, the decision was taken to retire the spacecraft before its propellant froze, making it completely inoperable.\nUlysses operated for over three times its design life. It was originally planned to survive for five years, and make a single orbit of the Sun. Its seventeen year mission duration made it one of the oldest spacecraft in service at the time of its retirment, along with the Hubble Space Telescope, which was launched just six months earlier, the Voyager probes, and the much older Pioneer Solar probes. It was also one of a handful of spacecraft to use a nuclear radioisotope thermoelectric generator to generate power."}

As a result of the associated conflict, edits pertaining to Bauer on Wikipedia were deleted and, following the commencement of legal proceedings, \"Wikinews\" exclusively obtained the offending texts and edits.\nJudge Jamie S. Perri dismissed the case citing the 1996 , promoting free speech over the Internet. The act protects the provider of interactive computer services from liability for publishing content provided by another.\nAt the start of the court action, Wikimedia asked the court to dismiss the case. \"Wikimedia asks the Court to dismiss the claims against it, with prejudice. The claims against Wikimedia are frivolous because they are barred as a matter of law by the , \"Section 230\" or the \"CDA\"), by the First Amendment, and by New Jersey law. Wikipedia is an online encyclopedia written by its users, the content of which can be created, edited, or removed by anyone.\nThe claims arise from statements made on numerous Internet websites, which Plaintiffs assert describe them as being among the \"20 Worst Literary Agents\" and having \"no...significant track record of sales to commercial (advance paying) published\" states the motion filed in Superior Court of New Jersey, Monmouth County,\" said the organization. \nBefore the case started, the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) issued a press release that defends against a suit Bauer filed against Wikimedia which states that contributors on Wikipedia posted \"libel statements\" against Bauer that labeled her as number three on a list of twenty people grouped as the \"worst\" publishing agents, and included allegations that she had \"no documented sales\" through her firm. Complaints filed against her and her firm state that Bauer had a bad record when dealing with \"commercial publishers,\", and questioning her practice of, \"charge[ing] in advance of making a sale, against the generally-accepted industry practice.\"\nIn March of 2007, Wikimedia was named in a lawsuit filed in Superior Court of , New Jersey, along with 20 other defendants which included operators of the \"Absolute Write\" web site and the \"Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America\" who authored the list.\n\"Wikinews\" has learned that Bauer's Wikipedia article was deleted some time during the course of the proceedings, along with the edit history of her article and its talk page as a \"courtesy.\" During the investigation, \"Wikinews\" found that all edits to her article, and edits to pages requesting it to be deleted were deleted by Wikipedia administrator MaxSem.\n\"Wikinews\" has also exclusively obtained all the edits affiliated with Bauer's article, which was sourced accurately, the deletion requests along with the edit history of all pages related to the discussion about Bauer's article. Fearing retribution on Wikipedia by other administrators and users, the source who provided \"Wikinews\" with the edit information wishes to remain anonymous.\nThe deleted Wikipedia article on Bauer stated that she claims \"to have placed books with a number of well-known commercial publishers, but does not provide specific details of the books in question. In 2006, due to the number of complaints they receive, Writer Beware (part of the writers' organization) listed Bauer's agency as one of the twenty worst literary agencies.\"\nBauer's article was started on May 25, 2006 but was not deleted until March 21, 2008 by Wikipedia administrator and Wikimedia office employee Cary Bass, who was not able to comment on the incident. It underwent two requests to be deleted, with the second one passing, and it was subsequently deleted. It had first been deleted on March 25, 2007 by \"Doc Glasgow\", an administrator, amid allegations that the information presented in the article was \"a bloody disgrace, full of 'allegations of who said what on message boards. No mainstream media interest.\" It was later restored on March 26 to undergo a \"deletion review.\" It was then deleted just under one year later after an extensive discussion.\nBarbara Bauer was shown to have threatened a number of website hosts who reproduced the \"Top 20 Worst Agents\" list, or referred to her inclusion in the list; her complaints apparently prompted a brief takedown of the AbsoluteWrite.com site.\nOne blog even states that Bauer attempted to get people fired from their jobs, after allegedly posting information online that was in any way connected to the \"Top 20 worst agents\".\n\"Barbara Bauer has been running around the Internet lately threatening people who've posted information about her fee-charging, non-manuscript-selling ways, including people who've linked to the Twenty Worst list. She has threatened legal action; she has even attempted to get people fired,\" states Victoria Strauss on accrispin.blogspot.com.\nThe EFF, along with attorneys at Sheppard Mullin Richter &amp; Hampton, are defending Wikimedia submitting a motion to dismiss the suit against the Foundation. The Foundation says that the of the United States and New Jersey law protect the contributors from any legal action.\nSpecifically, Section 230 of the act states, \"no provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider. No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be held liable on account of any action voluntarily taken in good faith to restrict access to or availability of material that the provider or user considers to be obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, excessively violent, harassing, or otherwise objectionable, whether or not such material is constitutionally protected.\"\nBauer claims that her agency informed Wikimedia of the false allegations, and requested that they be removed. She also claimed that Wikimedia refused to remove the information when requested. Bauer further states that the contributors involved with her Wikipedia article \"conspired to defame Plaintiffs and interfere with their prospective economic advantage.\"\nMike Godwin, attorney for the Foundation states that the point of Wikipedia is to return the knowledge it provides, to a worldwide culture.\n\"We provide a platform through Wikipedia for smart citizens to give their knowledge back to a larger culture. Our ability to offer citizens that platform is what's at stake in this case,\" said attorney representing the Foundation, Mike Godwin in a EFF press release on May 2, 2008.\nDespite the claim of freedom of speech, \"Wikinews\" has learned that on the same day, Godwin requested that the edits and the article on Wikipedia relating to Bauer, be deleted by a community action. Godwin also stated that the Foundation has \"filed court papers in which we stated that the article is no longer available.\"\n\"I've been trying to keep 'Office actions' to a minimum (partly in reaction to some fairly heavy-handed WP:OFFICE stuff in the past), and it would be helpful to be able to say that any given action was taken by the community, not by the Foundation,\" said Godwin on Wikipedia's Administrators' noticeboard on May 2, the same day of the EFF's press release. 'Office actions' are changes directly authorized by the Foundation which are made to content on any of the Wikimedia projects. The edits are made by staff members working for the Foundation's head office located in San Francisco, California. Edits of this nature are generally \"removals of questionable or illegal Wikimedia content following complaints,\" according to Wikipedia's policy on 'Office Actions.'\nA few minutes after, MaxSem, a Wikipedia administrator, deleted the edits related to the deletion request of Bauer's article as a \"courtesy\" stating that there would be \"legal problems\" if the edits were not deleted. \n\"Wikinews\" originally intended to publish an article at the start of the court case, although it was deleted from the article by \"Wikinews\" administrator , who said that it was deleted \"per consultation with Mike Godwin\" as the posting of any material relating to Bauer, on Wikimedia sites, could be considered contempt of court. The deleted copy of this article was then leaked to Wikileaks, who released a press release saying that the Wikimedia Foundation censored \"Wikinews\". At the time of this \"\" reported that \"Wikinews - like its sister site, Wikipedia - bills itself as a place without bias. Ostensibly, it's a democratic news source that never answers to a higher power. But that's just a setup for the latest act in the world's greatest online farce.\" \"The Register\" has a long history of denigrating Wikimedia projects."}

The FBI launched the manhunt on Tuesday after four victims were discovered on June 30, 2008.\nSheley was arrested without incident after being recognized in a bar in Granite City, Illinois. Two regular customers, Gary Range and Samantha Butler, and bartender Jennifer Lloyd recognized Sheley who had entered and ordered a glass of water. Range told the Associated Press that he then found a police officer parked nearby.\n\"I told [the police officer] the description and the officer said, 'That's him.' He got on the radio and eventually there were police all over the place,\" Range said.\nAccording to Sgt. Thomas J. Burek, Illinois State Police, the FBI, and the St. Louis Major Crimes Task Force, Sheley was apprehended without a struggle. He was arrested when he stepped out of the bar to have a cigarette and found himself surrounded.\n\"He was desperate and he gave up without a fight,\" said Tim Lewis, police chief in Festus, Missouri. \"He looks rough. He's had a rough two days.\"\nSheley is being held at Madison County Jail in Edwardsville. He appeared before County Judge Edward Ferguson and was charged with first-degree murder, aggravated battery and vehicular hijacking in the case of Ronald Randall. The 65-year old victim was beaten to death in Galesburg, Illinois on Saturday and found on Monday. Sheley is being held on US$1 million bail, which he indicated he would be unable to post.\nSheley's cousin, Eric Smith, is being held on obstruction of justice charges, while Sheley's brother, Josh Sheley, is being charged with concealing a homicidal death and obstructing justice.\nSheley's wife and uncle have both told reporters that Sheley, 28, is addicted to drugs and alcohol and prone to violence when under the influence of these substances.\nNicholas Sheley will also be charged with the murder of 93-year old Russell Reed in Sterling, Illinois, said the Whiteside County prosecutor. Medical examiners estimate that Reed was killed on June 23.\nOn Monday, the bodies of Brock Branson, 29, and Kenneth Ulve Jr., 25, of Rock Falls, Illinois along with Kilynna Blake, 20, and Dayan Blake, 2, of Cedar City, Utah were found. Police say that Sheley knew both Branson and Ulwe. The two were found in an apartment in Rock Falls and are believed to have died late Saturday or early Sunday.\nTom and Jill Estes of Sherwood, Arkansas were found in Festus, Missouri at a Comfort Inn, also on Monday. They were found after another guest at the hotel reported two dogs covered in blood in the parking lot. The couple had been visiting the area for a graduation and family reunion. Although 250 miles (400 km) away, this case was linked after Sheley's fingerprints were found in Randall's truck which was abandoned in Festus.\nAll eight victims succumbed to blunt force trauma."}

Reports state that 5 people have been killed, and over 300 injured. The injured were police and protesters alike, suffering from smoke poisoning, rubber bullets, and stoning. Among the injured was a Japanese citizen, who was reportedly flown to Japan in the morning.\nPeaceful protests began on Monday evening, however, they were dispersed in the night. The protests on Tuesday began peacefully on Sukhbaatar Square, however as they moved toward the headquarters of ruling party Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party, they were joined by many more people, who began attacking the building with stones, knocking out the windows. \nRiot police were deployed, and as the protests escalated with protesters setting the building on fire with alcoholic beverages and petrol, they reacted with tear gas and rubber bullets. As the Party Headquarters was almost completely set ablaze, the protesters began looting the vicinity, with reports of bank robberies. A wooden extension to the nearby Culture Palace, also known as the Art Gallery, also caught fire, with many priceless artifacts either looted or damaged by fire and water. As the police and army were deployed, about 700 protesters were detained.\nIn the aftermath, a four-day state of emergency was declared in Ulaanbaatar by President Nambaryn Enkhbayar. Measures include:\nPreliminary election results indicated that the MPRP had a clear majority in parliament.\nPolice chief said on the state TV that the situation is now under control, but it should be necessary to leave armored vehicles and the troops on their current positions in the capital. An emergency session of parliament also began at around 18:00 Local Time (July 2), however the session was closed to the media by vote, with the basis of high levels of tension erupting in case of disagreements during the session.\nAll TV channels have been cut off except for the Mongolian National Broadcaster. However some, like Eagle TV, and other internet-based news sites have been reporting on the Internet. A video on their site shows interviews with citizens claiming that their relatives have been detained while coming home from work, although having no part in the protests. The interviewees also allege that the investigators are brutally detaining them. The Government has made no reports about this.\nThe four days of emergency rule will be the first in the history of Mongolia."}

Police state that there are at least eight who were stabbed, all of them are in their 20s, and one of the injured was also shot.\nViolence began at about 3:00 pm MDT (21:00 ), when fifty inmates went out to a fenced yard for a recreational period at Edmonton Institution. Fighting quickly broke out between gangs when inmates attacked a group. Prison officers fired warning shots but they did not deter the fighting and an inmate was shot. Security eventually was able to remove the eight injured and have paramedics transport them to and by ground and air ambulance. Six are in stable condition, but two are in critical condition. Kevin Grabowsky, region president of the prison officer's union said, \"The incident, I think, was very much a surprise to one of the gangs involved in this fight.\"\nWhen the fighting ceased after the wounded were transported to the hospital, about 40 of the other remaining inmates stayed in the yard and refused to return to their cells. Negotiators tried to rectify the situation, but the prisoners' demands are not clear. Between 10:00-11:00 pm MDT, a fire was started by the inmates in the yard. Soon, officers equipped with riot gear entered the yard and cornered the inmates with tear gas. Fire rescue crews eventually doused the fire by 11:35 pm.\nEdmonton Institute is a maximum security correctional facility located in Edmonton, Alberta and houses over 200 inmates. There is high tension between gangs in the prison, which was locked down during the situation.\nAuthorities have recovered some of the weapons, and are investigating the incident."}

Tsvangirai has often criticized Mbeki for failing to publicly condemn Robert Mugabe, and has repeatedly called for him to step down.\nTsvangirai says that \"no meaningful progress can be made toward resolving the Zimbabwe crisis\" if the SADC or the African Union does not appoint at least one other mediator. \"If this does not happen,\" he says, \"then the MDC will not be part of the mediation process.\" \nHe added, \"If dialogue is to be initiated, it is essential that ZANU-PF stops the violence, halts the persecution of MDC leaders and supporters.\" The MDC says that 9 of its supporters have been killed by the state since the run-off, bringing the death toll up to at least 95.\nEarlier on Tuesday, leaders at an African Union summit voiced their support for dialogue aimed at the creation of a unity government in Zimbabwe. \"We encourage President Mugabe and opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai to honour their commitment to initiate dialogue with a view to promote peace, stability, democracy and reconciliation in Zimbabwe,\" the AU said in a statement.\nWhile the opposition rejected the idea of discussion, the Zimbabwe government called it a \"welcome resolution\", as stated by Information Minister Sikhanyiso Ndlovu. \"Government is ready for dialogue with anyone,\" he said, \"so long as it isn't dialogue concocted by the West.\" In his inauguration speech, Mugabe had said he was open to negotiations.\nTsvangirai believes that if a unified government were to be created, it should be based on the results of the original March 29 election, in which he received more votes but not enough to avoid a run-off. \"We remain committed to negotiations or talks, call them what you will, but they should be based on the fact that we won the last credible election on March 29,\" Tsvangirai said. \"Then we can move towards some transitional arrangement.\"\nThe European Union agrees with Tsvangirai on this point. Taking into account the March 29 vote, EU spokesman John Clancy says, \"it's clear that [Tsvangirai] should be a leading member of that government as its potential prime minister or the head of government to ensure that certain reforms can take place.\" The EU had been placing pressure on the African Union to take strong measures against Mugabe's government."}

The building partially collapsed on June 11, which originally caused 15 homes to be evacuated.\nSavarino bought the building from owner Bob Freudenheim for US$1.00 and states that he hopes to save as much of the building as possible, including the facade, at least 20 feet of the side walls, all of the back walls including the elevator tower and if possible all three floors. There is one major downside to the purchase; he inherits the over $400,000 tax lien against the property.\n\"It was a \"NYS Lotto\" purchase ('a dollar and a dream'). I do inherit the City\u2019s lien of $400,000 though,\" stated Savarino to \"Wikinews\". The fee is what the city has been billed for the limited demolition it paid for before Savarino bought the building. Currently the city is suing Freudenheim to force him to pay for those fees.\nThe building is currently undergoing minor demolition in preparations to make the rest of it stable. Once complete, Savarino plans to evaluate the extent of the damage and begin his plans to make the building into residential living spaces.\n\"Only unstable parts are being demolished. We will see what we have to deal with as the demolition proceeds but tentative plans are for living units on two floors with parking on the ground floor,\" stated Savarino. Construction is expected to begin as early as this year, but \"more than likely next year,\" he added.\nOriginally the city ordered an emergency demolition on the building after Freudenheim gave them permission to demolish it on June 12 during an emergency Preservation Board meeting. His reason was because he would not be \"rehabilitating the building anytime soon.\" \nFreudenheim, along with his wife Nina, were part-owners of the Hotel Lenox at 140 North Street in Buffalo and were advocates to stop the Elmwood Village Hotel from being built on the Southeast corner of Forest and Elmwood Avenues. They also financially supported a lawsuit in an attempt to stop the hotel from being built. Though it is not known exactly how long Freudenheim has owned the stable, Wikinews has learned that he was the owner while fighting to stop the hotel from being built. Residents say that he has been the owner for at least 22 years. Residents successfully halted demolition after winning a restraining order in New York State Supreme Court, which will continue to monitor developments in the case. The next hearing is scheduled for September 2.\nSavarino states his project could cost at least $3,500,000 and before construction can begin, all plans must be approved by the city's planning board."}

Cannons were also fired into the air just like they were when governor Clinton celebrated building of the Canal.\n\"I am very proud to support the redevelopment of the Erie Canal Harbor. The progress we are celebrating today, will continue. I am as convinced as can be, that as we see progress here at the inner harbor and the outer harbor, we are going to see the revival of Buffalo continue,\" said Clinton.\nThe project cost almost US$55 million to build, and its not over yet. A stretch of lakeside parks, trails and mixed use commercial and residential development is also planned for Buffalo's waterfront. City mayor Byron Brown says the redevelopment will attract hundreds of millions of dollars in new projects.\nSeveral other politicians were also present such as Senior N.Y Senator Charles Schumer, former Buffalo mayor Anthony Masiello and congressman Brian Higgins.\n\"By reclaiming our past, we are forging our future.

Ernesto Unabia was one of seventy confirmed fatalities in the disaster, which left eighty more missing.\nUnabia was a 37-year-old seaman who worked on international vessels, and earned a \u20b1120,000 salary. According to widow Verna Unabia, who filed the case with her three children, he was going to work on for thirteen more years and then retire. Unabia's case is the first to be concluded, although most victims settled with Sulpicio without claims being filed.\nAlthough Sulpicio lost their appeal several weeks ago, reporters have only today received access to documentation concerning the case.\nUnder Philippines law, employers are responsible for their employees actions. However, in Pesta\u00f1o vs. Sumayang the Supreme court ruled that if it could be proved an employer had taken appropriate diligence when selecting employers then they could not be held responsible.\nIt was viewed that Sulpicio was responsible as they failed to remove captain Esrum Mahilum from the vessel despite a number of incidents involving the ferry while he was in command of it. \"Princess of the Orient\" had struck the bottom of Manila's North Harbour, sideswiped a container ship and suffered a crippling engine fire while berthed at North Harbour, being towed first to Cebu and ultimately Singapore for repairs.\nDespite these serious incidents while the ship was under Mahilum's care, however, he was not removed from captaincy or even disciplined. A Board of Marine Inquiry (BMI) investigation into the ultimate sinking of the \"Princess of the Orient\" would later say that Sulpicio did not have enough initiative to take action against him. The court ruled this made them responsible for his actions.\nOn September 18, 1998, the day of the sinking, Captain Mahilum was warned before starting out that severe weather was approaching. He wrongly calculated that the storm was safely distanced and left port regardless, running into the storm two hours later. \"Princess of the Orient\" began listing to the left and a distress call was sent, but she sank before help arrived. The BMI's report blamed the disaster on the captain making \"erroneous maneuvers of the vessel before it sank.\" He remains missing to this day.\nAfter the court ruled that this made Sulpicio liable to pay civil damages an appeal was filed, in which Sulpicio said that the captain \"valiantly tried to save his ship up to the bitter end. He heroically went down with his ship.\" Although he failed to properly supervise the abandon ship order he gave, he was last seen helping passengers to board life rafts. Sulpicio further alleged that careful analysis of the BMI report showed he did not directly cause the disaster.\nThe court rejected the appeal, with judge Estella Alma Singco saying that while the failure to remove the captain wasn't the direct cause, \"such failure doubtless contributed materially to the loss of life.\" Sulpicio were ordered to pay P6.240 million in lost earnings, P100,000 moral damages, P50,000 indemnity - which Sulpicio had already offered to all the families of the deceased - and P50,000 in pursuer's litigation costs."}

On Thursday 16-year-old Shakilus Townsend was the victim of one of such crimes, being stabbed near his home in Thornton Heath in the south of the city. This is allegedly what persuaded the Met to create the taskforce, which aims to prevent these attacks by patrolling the streets of London's toughest areas.\nKit Malthouse, deputy for policing to London mayor Boris Johnson, has welcomed the move, stating that \"I'm extremely pleased the Met are ramping up their already significant efforts on Operation Blunt 2.\" Cindy Butts, deputy chairwoman of the Metropolitan Police Authority, added: \"It would be wholly wrong if the Met had not responded to the further dreadful murders that have happened this week.\"\nThe taskforce is to be composed of specialists, members of the Territorial Support Group, traffic officers and dog handlers who seek to target known gangsters and their contacts, as well as conducting random searches. Stop and search powers have already been enacted in Operation Blunt 2, using Section 60 of the Public Order Act. There have so far been 26,777 of such searches, yielding over 1,200 arrests and 528 knife confiscations.\nSir Paul appealed yesterday for help from London's communities. \"Sadly, in recent days, more young people have lost their lives to knife crime. This is not tolerable and clearly the message is not getting through,\" he said, adding that \"we all have to work together to get the message across that carrying knives has got to stop... we need to broadcast the message quite simply: if you carry a knife, you are likely to be caught, you will be charged and you will be likely to go to prison.\""}

The co-pilot was hospitalised in a critical condition with second and third degree burns, but is expected to recover. The plane had picked up four tons of car parts in Hamilton, Ontario and after making a stop at Shreveport, Louisiana was headed toward Plan de Guadalupe International Airport, which serves Mexico's Saltillo city.\nThe crash occurred around twelve kilometres from the runway. An investigation has been launched and the Public Ministry and the Civil Aeronautic Authority say an engine failure seems to have left the plane uncontrollable. The deceased has been identified as 46-year-old Lon McIntosh, and the co-pilot Chris James, was listed in critical condition after undergoing surgery at a Saltillo hospital.\nThe jet was registered N199US. Because the plane was registered and manufactured in the United States, and the engines were built there, a team from the US has been sent to assist Mexico in the investigation. The US National Transportation Safety Board has sent a senior investigator as the US representative, and he brings with him experts in weather and aircraft systems.

There are currently 7 candidates in the running to be elected for the Westminster seat. The deadline for nominations is on Wednesday, July 9.\nAt the last general election in 2005, Labour won with 60.7% of the vote, holding a 13,507-vote majority over runners up the Scottish National Party (SNP), who gained 17%. However there were delays in their candidate selection process when the frontrunner, George Ryan, dropped out for family reasons. Their nomination consequently went to Margaret Curran, MSP for the Scottish Parliament seat of Glasgow Baillieston and health and wellbeing spokeswoman for the Labour Party's Scottish arm. Set to start campaigning on Tuesday, she said she is determined to fight poverty and expressed her confidence in the party, claiming that \"Labour's fightback starts right here, right now.\"\nUK newspaper \"The Independent\" has claimed that it has information from MPs and a senior member of the Labour government, which states that they will seek to replace prime minister Gordon Brown if the party do not win the by-election. Labour MP Ian Gibson, who held a majority of over 5,000 votes in his constituency of Norwich North told the paper that \"the by-election in Glasgow is crucial. If he cannot win in his own backyard, things are desperate. I think he might go voluntarily.\"\nScottish first minister and SNP party leader Alex Salmond began the party's campaign today alongside candidate John Mason, who is a councillor in the city. \"There's a political earthquake on the way in Glasgow East,\" Mr. Salmond told reporters at a community centre in the constituency earlier, claiming that the area's below-average statistics were a \"condemnation of 50 years of Labour Party representation and Labour Party failure\". Mr. Mason also attacked Labour, saying that \"Labour MPs are so out of touch they voted to increase tax by another 10p.\" He is basing the SNP campaign around acting on rising energy costs.\nScottish newspaper \"The Herald\" reported that the by-election is \"expected to be a two-horse race between the Nationalists and Labour,\" but other parties have also been out campaigning:\nThe Liberal Democrat Party, third-place in 2005, have selected mathematics teacher Ian Robertson as their candidate. He will begin campaigning on Tuesday. Meanwhile the Conservatives, who came fourth at the general election with 6.7%, are aiming high, party leader David Cameron visiting the constituency today to launch his campaign which is themed on \"social decay\", and trying to \"repair the damage\" of Britain's \"broken society\". He said the party would solve problems like knife crime and poverty by \"treating not just the symptoms, but the causes too.\"\nAlso vying for the seat are Solidarity, who selected council worker Tricia McLeish, the Scottish Socialist Party, with former MSP Frances Curran, whose campaign begins on Tuesday, and the Scottish Green Party whose Eileen Duke, a retired GP, will fight the election."}

The European carrier rocket lifted off from ELA-3 (Launch Area 3) at the Guiana Space Centre in French Guiana, South America, at 21:47 GMT this evening, carrying the ProtoStar-1 and Badr-6 spacecraft.\nProtoStar-1 is the first satellite to be operated by ProtoStar Corporation, a Bermuda-based US/Asian communications company. It will be positioned at 98.5\u00b0 East longitude, in a geosynchronous orbit, around 36,000 kilometres above the Equator. It was built by Space Systems Loral, based on the LS-1300 bus. It will provide direct-to-home high definition broadcasting and internet services to South-East Asia. The satellite was originally named ChinaSat-8, and intended for launch on a Long March 3B carrier rocket by the Chinese satellite operator ChinaSat; this was cancelled due to US ITAR export regulations, with the uncompleted satellite being transferred to ProtoStar.\nBadr-6 will be operated by Arabsat, a Saudi Arabian company. It will be positioned at 26\u00b0 East, from where it will be used to provide direct-to-home television broadcasting services to the Persian Gulf. It was built by EADS Astrium and Thales Alenia Space, based on the Eurostar 2000+ bus. Badr is Arabic for \"full moon\". Badr-6, which is also designated Arabsat-4C, was built to replace the Arabsat-4A satellite which was lost in a Proton launch failure during early 2006.\nA 17-metre long payload fairing was used to encapsulate the two satellites, and a Sylda dual-payload adapter, used to allow the rocket to carry two satellites. There are several different types of adapter; the Sylda-5 configuration was used on this launch. ProtoStar-1 was launched in the upper position, mated to the Sylda adapter, whilst Badr-6 was in lower position, directly integrated onto the second stage of the carrier rocket. ProtoStar-1 separated from the carrier rocket just over 27 minutes after launch, followed by the Sylda adapter about 90 seconds later, and Badr-6 just under 36 minutes into the flight.\nFollowing confirmation of successful deployment of the satellites, Jean Yves Le Gall, the Chairman and Chief Executive of Arianespace, thanked the launch team for the successful launch. He also thanked the European Space Agency, who \"by their continuous support of space policy guarantee [Arianepace's] success\". Phillip Father, the President of ProtoStar, thanked Arianespace for the launch, and also thanked the \"many people who have touched us and helped us out\". He also said that he \"would like to take this opportunity to thank the families, spouses, and significant others who have supported us\". The Badr-6 programme manager stated that \"this is a moment of sheer joy and excitement\". He also referred to an unofficial Arianespace slogan, \"launches speak louder than words\", saying that \"we heard you loud and clear\".\nThe launch had previously been scheduled for late June, however delays with the previous Ariane launch caused it to be rescheduled for last Friday evening, from where it was delayed in order to replace part of an electrical connection between the rocket and mobile launch platform. This was the 34th launch of 2008, and the fourth to be conducted by an Ariane 5. This marked the 40th launch of an Ariane 5, and the 15th of the ECA configuration. The next Ariane launch is scheduled for early August, with the Superbird 7 and AMC-21 spacecraft."}

The prize is awarded for original and extremely innovative work in any branch of mathematics. According to the regulations, the prize is awarded \"to a mathematician who has fewer than 25 years (full time equivalent) of involvement in mathematics at post-doctoral level, allowing for breaks in continuity, or who in the opinion of the Fr\u00f6hlich Prize Committee is at an equivalent stage in their career.\"\nFrom early in his career in 1980 Higham became well-known in the numerical linear algebra community for his work on computing square roots of matrices and estimating matrix condition numbers. According to the citation for the award, his pattern of research is characterized by \"identifying a fundamental computational problem; analysing the algorithms that have been proposed already for it; finding a key improvement that leads to a better algorithm, often surprising experts who thought the problem was already solved; proving theoretically that the new algorithm works; implementing it in software; and publishing a definitive paper on the subject that is a model of scholarship and clarity.\"\nHigham has also made major contributions to other areas of numerical linear algebra, including component-wise perturbation theory, computation of the polar decomposition and the matrix sign decomposition, the practical aspects of fast matrix multiplication, the solution of matrix nearness problems, the stability of Cholesky factorization, theory and algorithms for generalized and polynomial eigenvalue problems, and the solution of Vandermonde systems. He has also contributed to of the theory and computation of functions of matrices, on which he has recently published a book entitled \"Functions of Matrices: Theory and Computation\".\nHigham was born in Salford, UK and grew up in Eccles, a suburb of Manchester. He is a graduate of the University of Manchester, having received his BA in 1982, MSc in 1983 and PhD in 1985. His PhD thesis was entitled \"Nearness Problems in Numerical Linear Algebra\"; his supervisor was George Hall.\nHigham is Director of Research within the School of Mathematics, Director of the Manchester Institute for Mathematical Sciences (MIMS) and Head of the Numerical Analysis Group.

One of the missiles launched was an upgraded version of the Shahab-3, capable of reaching Eastern European countries like Bulgaria and Greece as well and Middle Eastern countries such as Israel, Egypt and the Arabian Peninsula. Eight shorter range Zelzal and Fateh missiles were also launched.\nThe Iranians have been under international pressure to withraw from their plans of achieving nuclear proficiency, but have rejected putting a hold on their programme and have also been moving forward with their rocketry programme.\nThe test is believed to have been a reaction to Israeli and American military exercises, which the Iranian government believed to be training for an attack on facilities related to the Iranian nuclear development programme. In addition to these tests, Iran's first indigenous satellite launch attempt, which will place the Omid spacecraft into low Earth orbit, is expected immanently. A successful satellite launch would demonstrate that Iran's missiles have global reach.\nThe tests have been widely criticised by the international community.

The French ministry of defence suggested that \"these missile tests can only reinforce the concerns of the international community\", and the German government described the exercise as \"regrettable\".

It is unclear how many further tests have occurred today, but they are reported to have included at least one more long-range Shahab-3, and an anti-submarine Hoot torpedo. Some of the missiles are believed to have been launched from ships, as part of a series of naval manoeuvres.\nThe Iranians have been under international pressure to withdraw from their plans of achieving nuclear proficiency, but have rejected putting a hold on their programme and have also been moving forward with their rocketry programme.\nThe 'war games' have been seen by many other countries as a show of force against the possibility of an Israeli or American attack on facilities related to Iran's nuclear energy programme, seen as a risk for the development and proliferation of weapons of mass destruction within the unstable Middle East. Some of the naval manoeuvres have also been seen as a response to a statement by the US government that any attempt to close the Strait of Hormuz would be considered an act of war.\nMeanwhile, China and Japan have joined the list of countries criticising the military exercises. China's foreign ministry issued a statement expressing \"concern about these developments\", whilst Japan's cabinet secretary claimed that the exercise \"puts regional peace and stability at a disadvantage\".\nAccording to Alex Siu, of Taifook Securities in Hong Kong, crude oil and gold prices rose in response to the tests. \"Iran's missile test has raised worries on the safety of Israel,\" he said to the Xinhua News Agency.

It has caused at least one death, and it may have been a contributing factor in another. The pathogen responsible is the rare Saintpaul strain of \"Salmonella enterica\".\nNearly half of the reported illnesses were in Texas and New Mexico. According to unnamed sources close to the investigation, most illness clusters in the outbreak involve Mexican restaurants. Illness clusters in the hard hit state of Illinois were publicly identified by local health departments as involving three Mexican restaurants. \nThe CDC is in the process of investigating the outbreak and trying to identify the contamination's point of origin. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) currently suspects that the contaminated food product is an ingredient in fresh salsa, such as fresh jalape\u00f1o pepper, fresh serrano pepper, fresh cilantro, or certain types of raw tomato. \nSome produce industry insiders doubt that fresh produce is to blame for the outbreak. They point to the absence of \"Salmonella\" on all of the tested produce samples to date, as well as divergent results from produce tracebacks. They also say that the extended time frame of new sicknesses makes it unlikely that either raw tomatoes or fresh jalape\u00f1os, the government's two main suspects, could be responsible. Will Steele, President and CEO of Frontera Produce, said that \"the outbreak is probably related to processed goods and they\u2019re looking in the wrong closets.\"\nSteele's Texas based company has been forced to hold shipments of fresh jalape\u00f1o peppers after loads of produce were repeatedly flagged by the FDA for testing. Although independent testing of both loads showed no sign of \"Salmonella\", the peppers are still on hold until the FDA finishes its own testing of the second load flagged on July 1st. \"There are still no results,\" Steele says. \"The salability of that produce in two to three days is gone. We ceased harvesting. There is no sense in bringing in more product and having it rot.\"\nSteele, like others in the produce industry, believes that the FDA should be focusing on processed produce instead of fresh produce. \"Methodology is backward,\" he says. \"FDA is reaching for answers. You can\u2019t tie jalape\u00f1o pepper shipped on June 30 back to April 10.\"\nStill, the FDA and the CDC consider testing of fresh jalape\u00f1os and other fresh produce a high priority. The CDC writes that \"the accumulated data from all investigations indicate that jalape\u00f1o peppers caused some illnesses.\"\nThe FDA is cautioning that people who would be in the most danger if infected with \"Salmonella\" (infants, the elderly, and those with compromised immune systems) should avoid eating the suspected types of produce listed on their website."}

Bush before resigning last year, failed to appear in front of the House Judiciary Committee today, refusing to testify about allegations of misusing his political power.\nThe congressional panel is trying to determine if Rove had a connection with the prosecution of Don Siegelman, former Democratic governor of Alabama. The committee is also investigating allegations that the former White House adviser dismissed nine federal prosecutors seen as political opponents. Rove has denied ever influencing the decisions of the Department of Justice.\nIn May, the panel subpoenaed Rove in an attempt to force him to offer testimony. He was scheduled to appear at a committee hearing today, but his lawyer Robert D. Luskin made it clear that he would not attend. Luskin argued that his client was \"immune\" to the subpoena because of executive privilege, which gives executive officials the right to resist a search from the other two branches of government.\nIn a letter written to the committee on Wednesday, Luskin said that Rove is \"constitutionally immune from compelled congressional testimony\", adding that \"threatening Mr. Rove with sanctions will not in any way expedite the resolution of the issue.\" He said Rove would be willing to talk about the Siegelman case as part of an \"informal interview\", without a transcript and without taking an oath.\nMembers of the Judiciary Committee argued that executive privilege is not a valid reason to ignore a subpoena. California Rep. Linda Sanchez, who chairs the Subcommittee on Commercial and Administrative Law, said at the hearing, \"We are unaware of any proper legal basis for Mr. Rove's refusal to even appear today as required by the subpoena.\" She cited United States v. Nixon and Clinton v. Jones as legal precedents. \nSanchez, along with the Judiciary Committee chairman, Michigan Rep. John Conyers, said that Rove's refusal to testify could result in prosecution for being in contempt of Congress. \"A refusal to appear in violation of the subpoena could subject Mr. Rove to contempt proceedings, including statutory contempt under federal law and proceedings under the inherent contempt authority of the House of Representatives,\" Conyers and Sanchez wrote.\nIf the Judiciary Committee votes to pursue these contempt charges against Rove, they would go to the floor of the House, where Speaker Nancy Pelosi would decide whether to proceed with a final vote. The House has already held two of Bush's advisers in contempt for defying a subpoena: White House Chief of Staff Josh Bolten and former White House Counsel Harriet Miers. Their case is currently in federal court.\nRepublicans have accused Democrats of using these cases as political weapons against George W. Bush. Rep. Chris Cannon, a Republican from Utah, said that \"if the majority was serious about getting to the bottom of this issue\", they would have accepted Rove's offers to discuss the issue on his terms, informally and without a transcript. \"The fact that it hasn't is proof that their efforts amount to a partisan stunt,\" said Cannon."}

The announcement came seven weeks after the Doha Agreement, which ended an 18-month-long political crisis in Lebanon.\nA decree announcing the cabinet was signed by Prime Minister Fouad Siniora and President Michel Suleiman. Of the 30 member cabinet, 11 seats were given to the pro-Syria, Hezbollah-led opposition, fulfilling a promise of at least one third of the cabinet and giving them the power to veto legislation. The ruling coalition appointed 16 cabinet members, and President Suleiman chose the remaining three.\nOnly one of the 11 opposition ministers, Labor Minister Mohammad Fneish, is from Hezbollah. The rest are from the organization's Shi'a, Druze and Christian allies. The opposition also secured the coveted posts of Foreign Minister, Telecommunications Minister, and Deputy Premier. \nElias Murr kept his post as Defense Minister, and the position of Finance Minister was given to Mohammed Shatah, who served as Siniori's senior adviser in the previous cabinet. Education Minister Bahia Hariri, sister of slain Prime Minister Rafik Hariri, is the only woman in the new cabinet.\n\"Our differences will not be resolved overnight,\" Prime Minister Siniori said, \"but we have decided to resolve them through institutions and dialogue rather than in the streets.\" He says the two main tasks of the new government will be \"regaining confidence in the Lebanese political system\" and \"securing the holding of a transparent parliamentary election\". \nUnder the Doha Agreement signed on May 21, Michel Suleiman became president, and the opposition and the parliamentary majority agreed to form a unity government. However, the formation of the new government was hampered by political squabbles. Parliamentary majority leader Saad Hariri said the final breakthrough came when Siniora conceded to the opposition by accepting into the cabinet Ali Kanso, former head of the Syrian Social Nationalist Party.\nThe two factions arrived at the Doha Agreement after a long series of Hezbollah-led protests against Siniora's government led to fears of a new civil war. In May, 65 people were killed in sectarian clashes initiated by Hezbollah following a government attempt to outlaw their telecommunications systems. The forces of Syrian-backed Hezbollah were largely unopposed by the Lebanese military while taking over Sunni neighborhoods in Beirut but encountered heavy losses attacking Druze controlled areas. \nOne of the issues expected to be discussed among the new government is the fate of Hezbollah's weapons, which the group claims it needs for defense against a possible Israeli attack. Hezbollah has yet to disarm and even boasted on enhancing it's weaponry status despite it's signing of U.N. resolution 1701, calling for it's disarmament."}

Rogers has exclusive rights to the iPhone in Canada since it is the only national wireless carrier that supports the iPhone's transmission standards. Earlier complaints about high iPhone rates did not deter hundreds of would-be Canadian iPhone buyers who lined up hours before store opening times. They soon learned, however, that the new phones were in short supply, and like other countries experienced delays in activating the phones.\nA CBC News survey found that the most expensive basic iPhone service was in Italy for Vodafone customers at an equivalent US$2554 for a two-year contract. Canada's Rogers was the second most expensive at US$2176 for a three-year term. Swisscom customers in Switzerland will enjoy the lowest monthly service fees (US$34)."}

Mousa and nine other Iraqis were arrested by a patrol of the Queen's Lancashire Regiment and suffered ill-treatment for over 36 hours.\nAt a British court-martial last year, it was learned that Mousa and the other men were tied and hooded and repeatedly kicked and assaulted by troops.\nA witness in the case, Ahmad Taha Musa Al-Matairi, told the court that the seven soldiers involved \"celebrated beating him and a group of other Iraqis like it was Christmas.\"\nDuring the court-martial, Donald Payne plead guilty to a war crime and served a year in prison.

The bulk of the settlement is expected to go to the family of Mousa.\nA statement released by the MoD reads: \"The settlement is with an admission of liability by the Ministry of Defence ... for substantive breaches of Article 2 (right to life) and 3 (prohibition of torture) of the European Convention on Human Rights.\"\nAccording to the lawyers, Adjutant General Lieutenant General Freddie Viggers told the surviving victims and families: \"The British Army apologized for the appalling treatment that you suffered at the hands of the British Army. The appalling behavior of British soldiers made us feel disgusted.\" \n\"I hope this independent inquiry will reassure the public that no stone has been left unturned.

She said it was because \"It got too much for me to handle.\"\nDuring this case the defense brought forward a 30-year-old woman as a witness, who testified that the young girl was lying.

The FDIC has also placed a special advance, guaranteeing any funds over $100,000 for 50 cents to the dollar.\nThis move by the FDIC is expected to cost the organization at least four billion USD per year.\nIn the days leading up to the conservatorship, market analysts have predicted the failure of IndyMac due to the fact that it was shedding jobs and closing many of its branch offices."}

Of a total of sixty-eight on the bus, around forty are injured, although exact figures are unclear. All the victims are passengers, as the owner of the vehicle's operator Moana, Josef Rzepka, said both of the drivers on board escaped unhurt.\nA \"Reuters\" photograph shows the bus lying on its right side next to what appears to be a straight stretch of road. There is a slight slope under the bus and its rear end appears to have reached the bottom of the drop, crushing the roof at the back of the bus. It is not yet clear what caused the bus to swerve off the road, but as the crash occurred at 6:30 a.m. local time the driver may have fallen asleep at the wheel.\nThere are also allegations that the double-decker bus may have been in a poor state of repair. The father of one victim said that the vehicle's windscreen wipers were taped together and the paintwork had been done by a brush instead of sprayed on. He also said that his daughter had reported rain leaking through the bus roof. Polish media also says some parents were concerned by the bus before they sent their children on the journey, although others say the bus appeared mechanically safe. Regardless, the bus has been removed with a crane and subjected to a technical examination by police.\nPoland supplied a military aircraft to transport relatives into Serbia. \nThe crash is the worst in the area since a disaster in April 2004 that saw a Bulgarian coach returning from a journey to Croatia crashed into the Lim river, leaving twelve students dead. Road accidents are common in Serbia as regulations are commonly ignored. New legislation has been proposed to fine violators more heavily, but has yet to be implemented.\nAn investigation is ongoing.\nSources.\n "}

This procedure involved patching the slit in the artery from an endarterectomy with a Dacron or vein graft. The patch widened the artery so that when it closed the channel of the artery returned to normal size. The DeBakey artificial graft is now used around the world to replace or repair blood vessels."}

The newspaper's Internet news service informs that both cars were driving with the speed of 90-100 km/h (56-62 mph).

Kaczy\u0144ski is also reported to have asked Sarkozy for one minute's silence in memory of Geremek at a European political summit that took place on Friday. \nThe French president has commented Bronis\u0142aw Geremek's death, too. \"The President of the Republic has taken with emotion and sadness the note of the tragic death of Mr. Bronis\u0142aw Geremek.

He has been using his knowledge, experience and a huge international authority in Europe and in the world always for the good of Fatherland. I had the honour of working with professor Bronis\u0142aw Geremek for many years; I will always remember these years. He was a man of agreement and dialogue, and his idea was to connect people, not to part them. Polish sciences and politics have lost a great man, and many of us a great Friend\".\n\"I can't get out of shock, it is a great loss. Died a man of great talents, merits and knowledge, one of the fathers of the Polish democracy. He was a great man and patriot with a great life-sketch. A talk with him was always an adventure, intellectual and political. I have always respected his opinions and uncommon knowledge\", said Aleksander Kwa\u015bniewski, a former Polish president. \nJos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso, the President of the European Commission, has also issued a statement memorising Bronis\u0142aw Geremek. \"He was a European of exceptional stature, a Pole of unwavering convictions. All his life he demonstrated political courage without compromise.

Europe also loses one of its most ardent proponents who by the power of his conviction helped enlargement become a political success. Europe mourns a symbol of its reunification. I am proud to have had such a man among the ranks of Liberals and Democrats in the European Parliament and among my friends\". \nMany Czech politicians, including a former Czech president V\u00e1clav Havel, have commented the news of the Geremek's death, too. \"The report on Bronislaw Geremek's sudden death has touched me very much. I appreciated him as a remarkably reasonable and good man, very gentle as understanding. His death is not only a loss for Poland, but for all of us who are striving for the free and decent world\", said Havel.

A few days ago the UFO investigative organization Mutual UFO Network (MUFON) released a 77-page report on the sighting. MUFON is a UFO investigative organization in the United States. Founded in 1969, it now has 3,000 members and is headquartered in Fort Collins, Colorado.\nThe MUFON report, entitled \"Special Research Report Stephenville, Texas\" was written by Glen Schulze and Ropert Powell. Shulze has radar experience from working at the White Sands Missile Range. Powell has a chemistry degree and has extensive experience with semiconductors from working for Advanced Micro Devices.\nThe report is an analysis of radar records from the Federal Aviation Administration and the National Weather Service, obtained through several Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests, and comparing them to witness accounts.\nShulze/Powell concluded that the radar data confirms the witness observations of an object, as well as the Air Force's statement that said ten aircraft were operating in the area. They say that it is too difficult to say what the witnesses saw, but that there was something there. Twice, they say, radar picked up an object travelling at nearly 2,000 mph, and at other times it showed a slow moving object.\nMuch media attention has been focused on the report's observation that radar records show one of two objects moving directly toward the Prairie Chapel Ranch in Crawford. This is the home of United States President George W. Bush, which has been nicknamed the Western White House. They did not draw any conclusion as to why such movement was observed.\nThe authors also concluded that military air activity was heavy at the time, but that the radar records show no overt action toward the unknown object. They express concern about the possibilty that this could have been a terrorist aircraft with no transponder.\nShulze/Powell stated that they felt that they had been stonewalled in some of their FOIA requests by some government agencies. They encouraged the government to more readily provide more information about the incident.\nThe Stephenville incident on January 8, saw dozens of witnesses reporting a large object in the evening sky that hovered above the community before it took off at high speed. Steve Allen, a pilot, observed the object from the ground and described it as being a half-mile with flashing strobe lights. He also said that it was pursued by two fighter jets, when it disappeared at a speed he estimated to be 3,000 mph.\n\"I don't know if it was a biblical experience or somebody from a different universe or whatever but it was definitely not from around these parts,\" Allen said. \nAnother witness was local law enforcement officer Leroy Gateman who reported it as a red glowing object suspended 3,000 feet in the air. \"It was so fast I couldn't track it with my binoculars,\" said Gateman.\nRick Sorrells says he saw the object while deer hunting in the woods. \"You look at the trees, and it was right here,\" he told ABC News. He estimated it to be the length of \"three or four football fields,\" though he could not be entirely sure due to his vantage point.\nSorrells has later claimed that military helicopters have since overflown his property at low altitude and that he has been getting strange phone calls. He also claims that an unknown man came to his door, even once told him that,\"Son we have the \"same\" caliber weapons you have, but we have more of them.\", after Sorrells grabbed his rifle, and, \"You need to shut your mouth about \"what\" you saw.\"\n\"I'm trying to decide whether or not to open the door,\" Sorrells said to the \"Empire-Tribune\". \"We're just standing there face to face looking at each other. I'm thinking he's dressed for the elements and the dogs are raising such a ruckus he must know he's in danger of being caught. That's when I realized he wanted me to see him.\" The man then turned away and walked into the woods.\nThe United States Air Force initially said witnesses must have seen reflections coming from commercial airliners. However, they later clarified that ten F-16 Fighting Falcons had been on a night-time training mission in the area on January 8.\n\"In the interest of public awareness, Air Force Reserve Command Public Affairs realized an error was made regarding the reported training activity of military aircraft,\" said the statement.\nAccording to Air Force spokesperson Karl Lewis, the aircraft were from the 457th Fighter Squadron and the error in the initial report was due to an internal communications problem between offices at the base."}

I think it looks as if they made a brief breach into the base and were repelled.\"\nA Taliban force estimated to number in the hundreds then tried to overrun the outpost, which had only been occupied for several days prior to the attack, according to NATO's International Security Assistance Force (ISAF).\nThe outpost, which contained troops from ISAF and the Afghan army, was able to organize and call in air support and drive back the assault, which had been able to penetrate the base perimeters. An estimated 40 militants were killed in the battle, and 15 US troops have been reported wounded. The fighting continued until mid-afternoon.\n\"Instead of looking at it necessarily from the perspective of the Taliban or terrorists being more aggressive in coming after NATO or U.S. forces or Afghan forces, in this particular case it was an example of NATO, U.S. and Afghan forces being aggressive in combatting cross-border infiltration,\" said Sean McCormack of the United States Department of State.\n\"The attack on Sunday was a carefully planned one, with upward of 200 insurgents, to give it weight of force,\" said Captain Michael Finney, acting spokesperson for ISAF.\nAnalyst Haroun Mir, deputy director of Afghanistan's Center for Research and Policy Studies, said the attack showed superior planning. It was clear evidence of Al-Qaeda in the area, he claimed. He pointed to recent incidents, such as a major jailbreak in Kandahar in June as evidence of increased capability of the insurgents. "}

Another important aspect is the separate recovery of chemicals on board, primarily the fuel and a 10-tonne shipment of the dangerous pesticide endosulfan by Del Monte.\nThe ship had also been carrying a number of other chemicals in smaller quantities, including metamedopus, carbofuran, niclosemide, and proptineb. All of the chemicals must be removed by order of the DOTC before the vessel is recovered. The chemical recovery is to be performed by Titan Salvage, an international firm owned by Florida's Crowley Maritime Corporation and specialising in sunken and capsized ship recovery. Titan will co-operate with both Sulpicio and the DOTC, and expect the project to be completed within 60 days of the contract being signed.\nOnce the chemicals on board are removed then the ship itself can be recovered. Sulpicio has also named its contractor for this: Malayan Towage and Salvage Corporation (Salvtug). Salvtug has accepted the contract, but warned that its estimated operation cost is PHP2.25 billion to P4.5 billion, which is roughly equivalent to US$50 million to $100 million. Sulpicio had previously estimated that this exercise would cost P600 million.\nThe high cost is a potential problem as it is unclear who will pay. Sulpicio's insurance does not cover salvage. Had Sulpicio been covered with protection and indemnity (P&amp;I) insurance this would have been covered, but this is not required in the Philippines and so Sulpicio's insurance agreement with Oriental Assurance Corporation only covered the hull, machinery and third-party injuries and damage.\nIt is likely that Sulpicio will pay for the recovery of the ferry, which has a gross weight of 23,824 tons, but as the ship poses a potential environmental hazard it has been suggested that the government should pay the costs initially to ensure work is done quickly, with Sulpicio to be charged later for this. However, for now it is unclear who will pay for the vessel's recovery."}

A judge handed down jail terms between five months' and five years' imprisonment. The charges include abuse, fraud, criminal coercion and inhuman and degrading treatment. Another thirty defendants were cleared of charges, including assault. \nIn June last year former deputy police chief of Genoa, Michelangelo Fournier, belatedly admitted in court that police had \"butchered\" protesters. In a graphic description of the violence he said he had kept quiet until then \"out of shame and a spirit of comradeship\". \nThe heaviest sentence was five years for Biagio Gugliotta in the penitentiary police department, the commander on duty at the camp at Bolzaneto. Twelve other police officers, eight men and four women, received jail terms of five to 28 months. Doctors Giacomo Toccafondi and Aldo Amenta were given 14 months and 10 months respectively. Dr. Toccafondi was accused of insulting detainees and failing to inform authorities after they were sprayed with asphyxiating gas in cells. The judges issued their verdicts after 11 hours of closed-doors deliberations. \nAll those convicted are expected to appeal and none will go to prison until the appeals process is complete, which normally takes years. The sentences totalled less than a third of 76 years what had been demanded by the prosecution. The BBC's David Willey in Rome says it is unlikely that any of those sentenced will actually serve time in prison because their offences will have expired under Italy's statute of limitations before the appeal process is completed. It is expected the Italian government will be forced to pay out millions of pounds to those who were victims of police brutality during their detention. \nPolice were accused of organised and premeditated brutality at the Diaz High School which protesters were using as a dormitory during the summit. In another ongoing trial, 28 defendants, including some of Italy's most senior police officers, face charges related to the raid on the school. The raid left seventy-three protesters injured with three in comas. A judge ruled that there was no evidence to show any of those demonstrators had been involved in the violence in Genoa.\nMore than 250 of those arrested were taken to a holding camp that had been created at Bolzaneto, six miles from Genoa. The detainees at Bolzaneto included about 40 who were arrested in a raid on the Diaz school. During the trial the court heard how the holding centre had been the scene for \"episodes of torture that violated human dignity.\" One of the prosecutors in the case, Patrizia Petruziello, said that 40 protesters who were arrested suffered \"four out of five\" of the European Court's criteria for \"inhuman and degrading treatment\". \nOf the 252 demonstrators who claimed abuse, strong evidence emerged in at least 209 cases considered during the trial. Demonstrators said they were strip-searched, spat at, insulted, verbally and physically humiliated, beaten and sprayed with asphyxiating gas. Some were threatened with rape and sodomy. They were denied food, phone calls or access to consulates while detained. While being held they were forced to sing songs in praise of Italy's late fascist dictator, Benito Mussolini and other antisemitic songs about Chile's Augusto Pinochet, which which included the line \"Death to the Jews.\" The prosecution claimed that this was torture. \nThe 2001 summit in the northern Italian city was one of the most violent in the history of the G8. Between 100,000 and 200,000 demonstrators took part in anti-globalisation protests. A 23-year-old Italian demonstrator Carlo Giuliani was shot dead by a conscript Carabiniere and hundreds more injured as two days of riots erupted at the summit in the city of Genoa that was hosted by Italian premier Silvio Berlusconi. In December 2007, 24 demonstrators were found guilty of damage to property and looting. They were given sentences ranging from five months to 11 years.\nThe trial has lasted nearly three years. "}

He also remarked on his predecessor, Rob Peckham, thanking him for his \"unparallelled commitment and dedication\". Rohan Zaven, the Vice President of space programmes at DISH Network thanked Sea Launch for the launch, telling viewers that \"what you saw tonight was another flawless mission from these guys\". Zia Oboodryat, of Space Systems Loral thanked Sea Launch, and told DISH Network that he was \"sure that we'll deliver the rest of the fifteen years [expected lifetime] to you\".\nThis is the thirty-fifth orbital launch of 2008. It is also the fourth Sea Launch mission of the year, and the fifth Zenit launch. It is the 67th overall Zenit launch. The next is scheduled for mid-late August, with the Measat 3A satellite, from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan."}

The Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) apologized on Tuesday for erroneously issuing an \"earthquake early warning for advanced users\", with regards to an earthquake which occurred on the Monday night at sea off Ibaraki Prefecture, eastern Japan. There was, in fact, no possibility of huge tremors. The root cause was a simple human mistake that happened while setting a single seismograph with a criterion. The accidental release of the warning also revealed that some receiver devices could not handle warnings properly under certain conditions.\nJMA operates a system called \"Earthquake Early Warning\" (EEW). It is designed to analyze seismic waves as soon as possible after an earthquake is detected, and issue a warning if large tremors are expected to happen. Its purpose is to minimize the damage caused by seismic tremors. Two EEW schemes were put into practical use in 2006 and 2007.\nThe warning was released by the EEW scheme for advanced users such as railway operators, workers in factories, managers at some offices and schools, and some local cable TV broadcasters. Another EEW scheme for the general public, which is utilized by nationwide broadcasting networks such as NHK, was not involved in this incident. \nAll four subway lines operated by the Tokyo Metropolitan Bureau were suspended in response to the first false warning, even though it was corrected within 11 seconds. At a private railway company, an EEW receiving system crashed, apparently because of the wrong data. East Japan Railway Company, which has its own earthquake observation network, judged the warning to be an error and didn't take a real reaction in its railway operation. \nIn addition to troubling railway companies, the warning also caused confusion among people. Some commercially-sold receiver devices failed to handle the warning appropriately. Some of them, adapted by an information distributor company for its service, displayed an incredible magnitude of 12.7, while the warning didn't include a datum of the JMA magnitude. One device at a junior high school boarding house in Aichi Prefecture called an alert as if the seismic intensity could have reached to the Scale 6 Lower (the third highest of 10 JMA scales), causing some girl students to cry. The device didn't say that the students were far away from the focus.\nSuch failures show that recipients of an \"EEW for advanced users\" are not always trained well enough to react appropriately. Ironically, in the JMA building a similar case was also confirmed. A receiver device displayed a Scale 7 alert, the highest of JMA scales.\nAccording to JMA's announcement on the same night and news conference on the following morning, one seismograph was incorrectly set with the criterion of acceleration at 10 gals. (Correctly the criterion is at 100 gals.) This mistake resulted in the first (false) warning, which was soon corrected by the second warning. The JMA confessed that the seismograph has not undergone a check since it was installed in December, 2003. \nThe EEW scheme for advanced users is designed to put priority on calling alerts, so it releases a warning even if data from only one observation point is known. The same simple human mistakes were not committed at other points, according to JMA. In the parallel EEW scheme for the general public, the same mistake would not cause the same error, because it releases a warning based on data from multiple observation points, not depending on the criterion of acceleration."}

The student began receiving death threats and response, Myers said it was just a \"cracker\" and if any of his readers could acquire some consecrated Eucharistic hosts he would treat the wafers \"with profound disrespect and heinous cracker abuse, all photographed and presented here on the web.\" The criticism was fed in part by a press release by the Catholic League and its President Bill Donohue.\n\"It is hard to think of anything more vile than to intentionally desecrate the Body of Christ.

While fans await Craig's second outing in \"Quantum of Solace\", due later this year, they have been able to watch \"Shamelady\", a fan film made by the French film production company Constellation Studios.\n\"Shamelady\" is a tribute to Ian Fleming, the author of the James Bond novels on which many of the films are based, and EON Productions, the makers of the official 007 films. The film was first released in 2007 and runs just under an hour long. It can be downloaded from Constellation's website or viewed on YouTube.\nLegally, the filmmakers cannot profit from \"Shamelady\", but they didn't make it for the money, rather the thrill of creating an original Bond film. The plot is fairly simple, and reminiscent of \"Casino Royale\". Bond is sent to a casino to nab a vicious crime lord, but gets betrayed by a fellow agent in the process. Viewer reaction to the film was positive for the most part, and Constellation Studios has now planned a sequel to \"Shamelady\", which director Eric Saussine speaks of in the interview below.\nInterview.\nAlthough having made several other movies, Constellation Studios is best known for the acclaimed James Bond fan film \"Shamelady\".

The move, in conjunction with the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT), is in response to a recommendation made by the country's National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) as part of its investigation into a 1996 air disaster. \nTWA Flight 800 was a Boeing 747 that exploded in mid-air twelve years ago today, on July 17, 1996, above the Atlantic Ocean. All 230 people on board the New York to Paris flight were killed as the aircraft disintegrated shortly after takeoff from John F. Kennedy International Airport. It was ultimately determined that center wing fuel tank had exploded after sparking faulty wiring ignited a volatile fuel-air mix in the tank.\nAfter the investigation was completed the NTSB requested that the FAA enforce the requirement of inerting systems to prevent dangerous fuel-air mixes from being ignited. One of the most feasible ways of doing this is with nitrogen pumped into the tank, reducing the amount of oxygen available and making ignition difficult or impossible. The NTSB has a 'Most Wanted List of Transportation Safety Improvements' and inerting systems for airliners have been on the list since 2002.\nSince TWA 800 there have also been similar explosions in Thailand and India, but both occurred on the ground and resulted in no fatalities.\nThe FAA's new directive requires all new aircraft from August 20 to have the equipment fitted. It also requires all carriers to retrofit their fleets, with half of their airliners to be compliant within six years and every jetliner in the US to have the technology fitted in nine years.\nThe FAA's announcement was made at the Virginia hangar where the remains of Flight 800 are stored.\nAir carriers, who until now have fought against the changes, say that there will be a cost running into millions of dollars. If the nitrogen system is installed, the cost of retrofitting an airliner is at US$92,000 for mid-range jets such as the Boeing 737 and Airbus A320, and costs $311,000 for a Boeing 777 or other similar long-range widebodied airliner. The 747, which has a large center wing fuel tank, is especially vulnerable to such explosions.\nSources.\n "}

The group at Harvard Medical School and Children's Hospital Boston stated that the human cells, referred to as \"progenitor cells\", connected to the circulatory system of the mice. The team, lead by Harvard associate professor of medicine Joyce Bischoff, reported their findings in the journal \"Circulation Research\", published by the American Heart Association.\nJuan M. Melero-Martin, a co-author of the paper in \"Circulation Research\", said that one of the project's goals is to be able to replace some types of heart surgery with an injection of cells grown in a lab that could develop into functioning blood vessels. \n\"For clinical use, the way we envision it, if a patient has need to vascularize ischemic tissue, we can get cells from the patient ahead of time, grow them and inject them back into the patient,\" said Melero-Martin. \nIschemic tissue refers to tissue that has been damaged due to a lack of blood flow from blocked arteries or other causes. Researchers hope to be able to speed up the process of repairing damaged tissue and vessels in the heart to a period of one or two days. The procedure could potentially be used to treat organs damaged by heart attacks, or other ailments which impede circulation.\nDue to their controversial nature the research team did not use stem cells in their study, but rather relied on progenitor cells taken from bone marrow or blood. \"Our next goal down the line is to use them in humans. We need to do a lot more animal studies to test how these cells behave in different tissues,\" said Joyce Bischoff. \nDr. Nick Rhodes of the UK Centre for Tissue Engineering at the University of Liverpool described the results of the study as \"interesting and promising\", and commented: \"Although this approach is not yet suitable for clinical use, it is interesting that they have demonstrated you have all the elements you need to create a functional network of capillaries from a small amount of blood.\""}

The area in question has also yielded a field of floating debris and oil. According to Lt. Elizabeth Buendia, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Coast Guard in Guam, the search is likely to continue throughout the night.\nSince the bomber's crash at 9:45 a.m. local time, both local and military teams have mobilised six vessels, three helicopters, two F-15 fighter jets and another B-52. 70 square miles of sea have been searched, starting roughly 30 miles northwest of Guam's Apra Harbour.\nThe aircraft was posted to Guam's Andersen Air Force Base as part of a four-month rotation scheme and was based in Barksdale Air Force Base in Louisiana. It is believed that the bomber was scheduled to be used in a flyover of Liberation Day crowds celebrating the 1944 capture of Guam from Japan by the US, with the island remaining a US territory. However, some confusion exists over whether it was in fact another aircraft that was scheduled for the flyover.\nThe B-52 is a 160-foot (50-metre) long-range heavy bomber manufactured by Boeing suitable for mid-air refuelling. The first having entered service in 1955, it is one of the oldest types still operated by USAF, who have used the aircraft for both attacks and surveillance.\nThis is the second aircraft that the USAF has lost at Guam this year.

After 26 years at Barclays\u2014the last two of which were as vice chairman\u2014Gary Hoffman will replace Andy Kuipers. Kuipers, who has been with Northern Rock for 20 years, will be replaced at the beginning of October.\nLast September, Northern Rock suffered the first run on a British bank in over 100 years, and was forced to become nationalised. Today, Hoffman stated he would return the bank to private ownership \"as a thriving, stable business\". Some of his past roles include chairman of banking and chairman of Barclaycard. In his new role, he is expected to cut 2,000 of the 6,000 jobs provided by the company in an attempt to be able to pay back money owed to the Bank of England. He is to earn \u00a3700,000 per year, plus \u00a3400,000 in compensation from losses due to his moving. Including a bonus, he is expected to earn \u00a31.5 million in his first year, making him Britain's highest paid public servant. Among other tasks, he will be working to pay back the \u00a325bn loan Northern Rock got from the Bank of England by 2010, and reducing its mortgage lending from \u00a3100bn to \u00a350bn.\nNorthern Rock hit problems in September 2007. Issues in the mortgage market and public concern over the stability of the bank saw queues form with people keen to withdraw their funds following emergency support being provided by the Bank of England. With share prices plummeting as a result of issues in the United States sub-prime mortgage market, an unprecedented crisis struck one of the UK's largest banks. By February 2008, the decision was taken to move the bank into public ownership and it was nationalised. Today's appointment is the first step on a road to returning the bank to private ownership with significant measures required to cut the bank's costs, repay loans from the Bank of England, and transform the institution into one which is attractive to the stock market."}

Already last week, Environment Minister Jean-Louis Borloo said the ground water near all reactors should be tested and the state of waste storage sites assessed.\nIn the latest incident, a hundred workers were exposed to radiation. They all work for \u00c9lectricit\u00e9 de France (EDF), which runs the Tricastin facilities with Areva. This marks the largest number of workers to be collectively contaminated in French nuclear history.\nThe leak was at reactor number four, which was shut for refuelling. Workers were exposed to Cobalt 58 dust which escaped while maintenance work was being carried out. Sensors noticed a rise in the level of radiation and the workers were then evacuated.\n\"Seventy of them show low traces of radioelements, below one fortieth of the authorized limit,\" EDF said. A spokesperson later raised the number to 97 people. Criirad warned, however, that the limit was \"not the level from which risk begins but the maximum acceptable level.\"\n\"We have an alarm system which is meant to protect the staff from contamination via the atmosphere,\u201d said Tricastin director Alain Peckre. \"If a problem is detected, the alarms go off, our security procedures swing into place and everyone is evacuated from the building.\"\nA union representative from Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration g\u00e9n\u00e9rale du travail (CGT) alleged that EDF was reducing maintenance and increasingly using sub-contractors, putting workers at risk in exchange for profitability.\n\"We spend 1.5 billion euros a year on ensuring our plants are in optimum condition,\" countered an EDF spokesperson. \"Safety is our top priority over and above providing electricity to the network. Since our power stations were set up, 80 per cent of maintenance operations on reactors that have been temporarily turned off are carried out by external contractors. They are the most competent to maintain and repair specific parts of the reactor, some of which they have taken part in building.\"\nThe previous incident, on July 8, involved a 74kg spill of liquid containing unenriched uranium. Thirty cubic metres of water overflowed while a tank was being emptied. Subsequent test showed that contamination may have occurred for years.\nLocal wine growers Coteaux du Tricastin AOC have already become concerned about the negative association with \"Tricastin\" and have begun considering changing the name of their Appellation d'origine contr\u00f4l\u00e9e (AOC).\n\"It's only a question of image as nuclear and food don't mix very well in consumers' minds,\" said the AOC's president, Henri Bour, to \"The Daily Telegraph\". Nuclear authorities \"didn't understand our move, doubtless not wanting to admit that the nuclear industry's image is perhaps not perfect,\" he added.\n\"Nuclear was progress and we wanted that. We thought people were competent. Now we ask, were there previous incidents we weren't told about?\" said local resident Roger Eymard to \"The Guardian\".\nAutorit\u00e9 de s\u00fbret\u00e9 nucl\u00e9aire (ASN), a nuclear safety authority, has already criticised Areva for its handling of the first incident. ASN complained of poor communication with authorities and unsatisfactory security measures and operational procedures.\nThe leaks have occurred just as President Nicolas Sarkozy has been promoting the European Pressurized Reactor (EPR) as a solution to rising energy costs and global warming.\nFrance has the second largest nuclear power network in the world and generates over 80% of its electricity through nuclear power."}

The genetic variation is found in two-thirds of sub-Saharan Africans.\nThis particular variation on the gene, in which a single genetic letter is flipped, is thought to be a defense mechanism against malaria. It stops the growth of the malaria-causing parasite Plasmodium vivax. Concurrently, it also causes chemokines (proteins secreted by cells) to avoid red blood cells, an opposite behavior of the typical Duffy gene. \nAn on-going study of African American Airmen has found that the group infected with HIV was more likely to lack red blood cells that host the Duffy gene. The study, published in \"Cell Host &amp; Microbe\", does not identify why the absence of the chemokine receptor in red blood cells increases susceptibility to HIV, but the occurrence of the virus in such people is beyond the levels of chance.\nThe study also found that those carrying the DARC variant lived longer with HIV/AIDS. While this comes as good news to those already infected, it also means that the window for the unwitting spread of HIV is now known to be wider, since infected individuals with the gene mutation can take an average of two years longer to show symptoms. In terms of numbers, the two years of unknowingly being a source for infection translates into as much as 11% of AIDS cases in Africa."}

The defeat is one of several in recent months, including fifth place in the Henley and the loss to the Conservatives of Crewe and Nantwich by-elections in England, and the loss of the London Mayoralty.

A orthodox seminary student took the note and gave it to Israeli newspaper, \"Maariv\". Obama is on an international tour to strengthen his foreign affairs credentials ahead of the November election.\nJewish clergy and others have expressed dismay at this personal violation of privacy. Rabbi Shmuel Rabinowitz, who is the supervisor of the Western Wall, told Israel Army Radio that it was a \"outrage\", and that \"The notes placed between the stones of the Western Wall are between a person and his maker. It is forbidden to read them or make any use of them.\"\nAnalyst and director of the Orthodox Am Ehad think tank, Jonathan Rosenblum said, \"It's inappropriate that the prayers of a person at the Western Wall should become a subject of public knowledge at all.\"\n\"There is a rabbinic prohibition against reading other people's private communications, and certainly anyone who goes to the wall expects that those communication will be protected,\" Rosenblum added.\n\"Maariv\" has drawn significant criticism for the publication of the prayer. Other Israeli media have chosen to not publish the letter to respect Obama's privacy while many media sources outside Israel have printed the note or excerpts of it.\nIn the note, Obama did not pray for success in his election but rather prayed for protection for his family and forgiveness. The note ended with Obama asking for God to \"help me guard against pride and despair. Give me the wisdom to do what is right and just. And make me an instrument of your will.\"\nThe Western Wall, often referred to as the Wailing Wall, is the lone remaining outer retaining wall of the second Jewish temple and is considered to be Judaism's holiest site. The temple, which was destroyed by the Romans in A.D. 70 was constructed on the same mountain ridge where King Solomon built the first Jewish Temple in the 10th century BC, which was destroyed by the Babylonians in 586 B.C. According to classical Jewish belief, the Temple (or the Temple Mount) acts as the figurative \"footstool\" of God's presence in the physical world."}

Cross-dressers, gays, lesbians, transgender and gender inspecific individuals were in attendance. The group claimed a unified purpose: to express feeling betrayed by the HRC's action, a move the protesters argued is opposed by over 350 local, statewide and national LGBT advocacy organizations.\nThe event quickly developed into more than ordinary civil disobedience. The \"Left OUT Party: A Genderfal Gay-la\" elicited a festive mode among individuals who oscillated between roles of protester and entertainer.

The Indonesian foreign ministry, which had earlier believed its plan to \"fast-track\" safety improvements for three airlines would see them back in the EU by July's end, suggested that the ban may have political overtones.\nIndonesia had implemented a program to bring state-owned flag carrier Garuda Indonesia up to EU standards, as well as private rivals Mandala Airlines and Airfast. This received a boost in May when Garuda passed a safety audit by the International Air Transport Association.\n\"Indonesian authorities have still not developed and implemented an efficient oversight program on any of the carriers under their regulatory control,\" said the EU's Air Safety Committee upon rejection of the three airlines' request for permission to return to the EU. It was added that Indonesia had no effective oversight program and that the International Civil Aviation Organisation had been unable to assess recent changes. \nThe committee also noted that inspectors did not have the power to ground substandard aircraft and urged Indonesia to increase inspections themselves. A report from the Indonesian director-general of civil aviation said that, between January and April, Garuda performed just nine of 56 mandatory surveys, while Mandala conducted only two out of 27.\nThe committee acknowledged some improvement by the three airlines, but was unanimous in rejecting their request to have the ban lifted.\nTeuku Faizasyah, spokesman for the Indonesian foreign ministry, expressed disappointment at the result and questioned the reasoning behind it. \"We are disappointed with the prolonging of the ban. We've done some improvements so we do hope that those actions taken could be considered,\" he told reporters. \"The way we see it, the EU always puts their actions (in terms of) technicality issues. But we question if there are political motivations behind the decision.\"\nThe ban was implemented in 2007 following deregulation in the 1990s that triggered a string of aviation accidents. On New Year's Day 2007, 102 people were killed when an Adam Air Boeing 737 crashed into the ocean near Sulawesi. This was followed in March by a Garuda 737 overshooting the runway at Yogyakarta Internataional Airport with 21 fatalities.\nAdam Air has since been grounded, while on Thursday Captain Marwoto Komar, pilot of the Garuda jet, went on trial charged with a range of possible offences, the most serious of which could see him imprisoned for life."}

Monthly ridership was 22 percent higher last month than a year ago.\n\"They have crushed loads on their rail lines, already where people are standing, and there's not enough seats,\" said Rich Bickel, the director of the Delaware Valley Regional Planning Commission.\n\"At peak times some railcars are standing room only and commuter parking lots are nearly full. All Regional Rail lines are running near full capacity and the train station parking lots are at about 90 percent capacity or more,\" SEPTA spokesperson Felipe Suarez said.\nWhile SEPTA awaits new Silverliner V trains from Hyundai Rotem, which begin arriving in 2009, it had hoped to lease eight rail cars from New Jersey Transit, at an agreed-upon rate of US$10,000 per month. However, due to problems with insurance and liability indemnification, the deal fell through, according to Casey.\nSEPTA has entered a new agreement to purchase the eight rail cars from NJ Transit. The transit authority will pay US$670,000 for the cars and assorted supplies plus one additional inoperative car which will be used for spare parts. The rail cars will be operated using a SEPTA provided locomotive as they are not self-propelled.\nThe cars are being disposed of by NJ Transit because it has switched from single-floor cars to double-decker cars.\nSEPTA is expecting to raise US$3.1 million by selling rail that has been out of service since 1981 at auction."}

Firefighters said they believe the fire started in an area containing deep fat fryers. Smoke could be seen as far away as ten miles.\n\"Indications are that there were some deep fat fryers in the area where we believe the fire first started,\" said chief fire officer Kevin Pearson. \"We're fairly clear about where we think the fire first started and obviously our investigations will concentrate on that area.\" \nA local hotel operator described the fire as an \"inferno\" and said of the pier: \"It is part of our identity and would really affect trade if we were to lose it.\"\nThe owner of the pier bought it in February of this year, but was in Spain on holiday at the time of the fire. \"He is absolutely devastated,\" said spokeperson Nigel Heath. \"He had a huge personal involvement in the project and was totally committed to it.\"\nThe loss of the pier could affect the resort town of Weston-super-Mare.

The February 3 fire and subsequent sinking killed 1,034 of around 1,400 passengers.\nMamdouh Ismail, owner of the al-Salam company, his son and three company executives were all cleared of manslaughter. Ismail is a member of parliament directly appointed by the president, and both he, his son and another of the executives were tried \"in absentia\" as they have left the country. They had all been charged with manslaughter stemming from safety violations on the ship.\nConvicted was Salaheddin Gomaa, captain of nearby ferry \"Saint Catherine\". He was jailed for six months after the court found he did not come to the stricken \"al-Salam 98\"'s aid. It found he \"did not do his duty by failing to go to the rescue of victims,\" and that he failed to show any compassion.\nThe ship went down in the Red Sea near Egyptian port Safaga, where the trial was held, having departed earlier from Saudi Arabia's Dhaba port. A parliamentary report balmed the disaster's scale on the owners, as well as the government and Panama, the state where the ship was registered. The report said al-Salam had kept operating the ship \"despite serious defects\" with her, and that the government had \"failed to manage the crisis adequately\" in the following days.\nIt was found that the 36-year-old \"al-Salam 98\"'s safety documents were forged, that the ship's extuinguishers and life rafts were not fit for purpose and that there were an inadequate number of winches to lower the rafts into the sea. However, the elder Ismail had put the blame on his ferry's captain, who he claimed wrongly believed the crew could deal with the fire when it broke out. The captain was amongst the dead.\nIsmail's assets were frozen and a travel ban was imposed on him following the disaster, but both were lifted later that year after he paid E\u00a3300,000,000 (US$57,000,000) into a victim's compensation fund. Many victims were poor Egyptian migrant workers, and some were bringing home savings accumulated over months or years.\nThe Misdemeanor Court's acquittal of all except Gomaa \u2014 who was fined E\u00a310,000 (US$1,887) \u2014 met with anger from relatives, who turned out \"en masse\" to hear the verdicts. One man told \"al-Jazeera\" \"The day of the accident everybody saw that the ship was in bad shape and two years later they say the boat was in good shape. It doesn't make sense. This is awful. My wife and children died and after two years everyone responsible is found to be innocent.\"\nPublic prosecutor Abdel Meguid Mahmud was also unhappy with the result. In a statement he said he intends to appeal the verdict and demand a retrial. He alleges serious \"violations in documented records, corruption in investigation, shortcomings in validatings and arbitrary conclusions,\" and cites these as his reasons for a retrial."}

The ice was confirmed by the use of an instrument that can identify vapours; a small sample of ice within Martian soil was heated until it melted at 0\u00b0C (32\u00b0F), the melting point for water.\nThe original mission was planned to be funded for a 3 months, with the cutoff in late August. However, as a result of the probe's good condition, NASA has stated that its mission will be extended by 5 weeks, till September 30.\n\"Phoenix is healthy and the projections for solar power look good, so we want to take full advantage of having this resource in one of the most interesting locations on Mars,\" said the Head of NASA's Mars Exploration Program, Michael Meyers. An additional expense of US$2 million will be incurred because of the extension, on top of the US$420 million that has already been spent. This will allow for two more trenches to be dug, which will be dubbed as \"Cupboard\" and \"Neverland\".\nThe Phoenix probe landed on Mars on May 25 of this year near the north pole of Mars, where the ice was discovered. The ice was found in a trench approximately 5cm deep referred to as \"Snow White\". \"It's been very successful and Mars had proven itself to be very interesting, mechanically the spacecraft is operating great, and there's plenty of power margin to carry us beyond the waning summer,\" said Meyers.\nThe original goal of the mission was to determine if the red planet was capable of supporting life. Phoenix is in the process of performing experiments to determine if ice ever melted in Mars' history. In addition it is searching for the organic-based compounds that are necessary for life forms to exist.\nPhoenix's principal investigator Peter Smith told the press conference that \"we hope to be able to answer the question of whether this was a habitable zone on Mars. It will be for future missions to find if anyone is home on this environment.\"\nUnlike the twin which has now been operating on Mars for several years, the Phoenix Lander itself is expected to cease operations entirely by the exit of 2008 when the harsh Martian polar winter takes over and the low temperatures most likely will leave the Lander's instruments irreparably damaged."}

This change to mix advertising directly into the content has led many Wikia hosted sites to begin discussions regarding leaving Wikia hosting for their own. As Wikia's business model hinges entirely upon user-generated content, large numbers of sites leaving could leave Wikia in financial trouble. Wikia has lost editors and volunteer \"janitors\" as a result of this.\nSome changes were made to make sure Wikia doesn't lose its community; one of them being the ability for logged-in users to turn off advertisements in their personal preferences, which would eliminate the ads from all other pages except the main pages of different Wikia wikis. However, this didn't help much and several wikis, most notably the Transformers Wiki advised their users to switch to Firefox browser and install the AdBlock plugin to remove advertisements. The problem was the excessive advertisements on every content pages which most of the Wikia communities didn't agree with. \nSince the new \"Monaco\" skin version 3.1. was rolled out across all Wikia-hosted wikis, Wikia introduced a set of \"main page column tags\" meant to aid in main page designing while minding Wikia's new advertisements. Most, if not all Wikia's English-language wikis, such as Wookieepedia, the Star Wars Wiki, Wiki 24 and WoWWiki have converted their main pages to use these new main page column tags. Wikia's \"helpers\", people working as interns for Wikia, have helped to convert wikis to the new main page layout. However, some wikis, such as the Transformers Wiki opposed the change to their main pages and thus refused to convert their main page to use the main page column tags. Newly-created Wikia wikis will have a main page that has the main page column tags by default.\nCertain Wikia-hosted communities have criticized their host for trying to make Wikia look like one big website to please the advertisers when the communities would prefer to stay independent from other Wikia's wikis.\nDuring the rollout of the new Monaco skin, the phrase \"Wikia will never host pop-up adverts.\" was removed from Wikia's terms of use and later reinstated into the terms.

In addition, the S1600 and S3200 standards will continue supporting the S400 and S800 previous standards through backward compatibility.\n\"The new standard includes all of the amendments, enhancements and more than 100 errata which have been added to the base standard over the last 12 years,\" Les Baxter, chair of the working group which developed the standard, said in a press release cited in several sources. \"This update provides developers with a single document they can rely upon for all of their application needs.\" \nThe standard should be ready for deployment in October.

His lawyer has called the death a suicide.\nBruce Edwards Ivins, 62, was taken to Frederick Memorial Hospital in Frederick, Maryland, where he died of an overdose of Tylenol and codeine, the \"Los Angeles Times\" reported Friday.\nIvins, who worked at the biodefense laboratories in Fort Detrick, Maryland for 18 years, was about to be charged by the Justice Department in connection with the 2001 anthrax attacks, which killed five people and infected 17 others.\nIvin's lawyer, Paul Kemp, insisted that his client had no role in the attacks, which targeted politicians in Washington DC, and members of the media in New York City and Florida.\n\"For six years, Dr. Ivins fully cooperated with that investigation, assisting the government in every way that was asked of him,\" Mr. Kemp told the \"New York Times\". \"The relentless pressure of accusation and innuendo takes its toll in different ways on different people, as has already been seen in this investigation. In Dr. Ivins\u2019 case, it led to his untimely death.\"\nBoth the \"New York Times\" and the \"Los Angeles Times\" report that Ivins assisted the FBI and other agencies in the investigation after the 2001 attacks.\nThe \"Los Angeles Times\" reports that Ivins was reinvestigated beginning in 2006 after FBI Director Robert Mueller changed the case's leadership. Before then, the only labeled \"person of interest\" was Steven J. Hatfill. He has since been cleared and paid between $4.6 and $5.82 million by the U.S. Government as part of a settlement stemming for 2003 law suits filed against the Justice Department and government officials, including former Attorney General John Ashcroft.\nThe \"New York Times\" also reported that a spokesman for Hatfill said that rushing to judgment in the case is a mistake.\n\u201cEverybody is jumping to the conclusion that because this guy committed suicide, he must be the anthrax killer,\u201d Mr. Clawson told the \"New York Times\". \u201cThat is a lousy premise. The pressure of these F.B.I. investigations on individuals is phenomenal, and it is quite likely that this guy cracked under that pressure but had nothing to do with the killings.\u201d\nThe \"New York Times\" reports that Ivins had been undergoing psychiatric treatment within the last month and had a restraining order placed on him by a woman he was allegedly stalking and threatening.\nAccording to National Public Radio (NPR), mental health professional Jean C. Duley requested that Frederick County court issue a \"peace order\", a type of restraining order, against Ivins in July. Duley submitted documents to the court which show a history of \"homicidal actions, threats and plans.\"\nThe \"New York Times\" also reports that Ivins was a religious man. Members of his congregation gathered early Friday to pray for him at St. John the Evangelist Roman Catholic Church in Frederick.\nThe Associated Press cites one of Ivins' colleagues who said he had been removed from his work area as he was thought to be a potential threat to others. According to NPR, one colleague said he was \"emotionally fractured by the federal scrutiny.\""}

The patient, whose name has not been released, underwent the operation at the Klinikum rechts der Isar, part of the Technical University of Munich (Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen), last week; he is said to be recovering well.\nThe operation lasted 15 hours and was performed by a team of 40 specialists in Plastic Surgery, Hand Surgery, Orthopedics and Anesthesiology, under the direction of the head of the Plastics and Hand Surgery department, Prof. Hans-G\u00fcnther Machens, Dr. Christoph H\u00f6hnke (Head of Transplants, Senior Physician; Plastics and Hand Surgery) and Prof. Edgar Biemer, the former Chief of Plastic Surgery at the Clinic.\nIn a press statement released by the clinic, it was revealed that the patient had been thoroughly physically checked and had psychological counselling prior to the surgery to ensure he was mentally stable enough to cope with the procedure. Since completion of the surgery, the patient has been on immuno-suppressant drugs to prevent rejection of the new limbs.\nFollowing the surgery, the press release from the clinic's press manager, Dr. Tanja Schmidhofer, included the following statement:\nWithout the immuno-suppressant drugs given to the patient, the risk of there being a Graft-versus-Host Reaction or GvHR, would have been significant due to the upper arm containing a large amount of bone marrow, consisting of ICC's or Immuno-Competent Cells, which would have triggered a near total rejection of the new limbs. A GvHR is a condition which results in the cells from the transplant attacking the immune system of the body.\nIndications from the clinic suggest that the double attachment went well, although it could be up to 2 full years before the patient is able to move the arms.\nThe donor arms came from an unnamed teenager, who is believed to have died in a car accident."}

According to a statement issued by SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, the first and second stages of the rocket failed to separate, making this the third consecutive unsuccessful launch for the Falcon 1, which is yet to conduct a successful mission. Musk described the failure as a \"big disappointment\".\nThe primary payload for this flight was the Trailblazer satellite, which was to have been operated by the United States Air Force, and MDA. Two CubeSats, Pharmasat Risk Evaluation Satellite (PREsat) and Nanosail-D, were also to have been deployed. The CubeSats would have been operated by NASA and Santa Clara University. The space burial capsules, named \"Explorers\" and operated by Celestis, were to have intentionally remained bolted to the second stage of the rocket. The remains of several famous individuals were flown, most notably Project Mercury astronaut Gordon Cooper and actor James Doohan, best known for his role as Montgomery Scott in the science fiction television series Star Trek. Director John Meredyth Lucas, who also worked on Star Trek, had some of his ashes on the flight as well, as did Mareta West an astrogeologist who was responsible for choosing the landing sites for the Apollo missions to the Moon. This is the second consecutive failure of a major orbital space burial mission, following a failed Taurus launch in September 2001. The last successful major orbital space burial was conducted in December 1999, although a single burial capsule was launched aboard the New Horizons spacecraft in 2006.\nThis launch was originally planned to occur in early 2004, with the TacSat-1 satellite and the \"Explorers\" payload. It would have been the maiden flight of the Falcon 1. A number of procurement delays pushed it to 2005, and subsequent issues with the availability of Space Launch Complex 3 at Vandenberg AFB, from where it was originally scheduled to launch, led to the first attempts to launch being made in late 2005. During the second attempted countdown, a faulty valve caused the first stage fuel tank to be deformed, leading to a delay.\nIn March 2006, a flight which was originally scheduled to be conducted after this one, with the FalconSat-2 spacecraft, was launched as the maiden flight, and ended in failure less than a minute after lift-off due to a fuel leak. This caused delays for all other Falcon launches, and a test flight without a functional payload was added to the schedule in order to ensure that the problems with the rocket had been resolved. This was launched in March 2007, and also failed - this time due to a sequence of events started by human error in setting the fuel ratio for the first stage. Despite the failure to reach orbit, most critical systems were tested, so the third flight was cleared to launch an operational payload. \nIn the meantime, the satellite that was to replace TacSat-1, TacSat-2, was launched, and TacSat-1 was subsequently cancelled as obsolete. During early 2008, the US Air Force announced that they would replace it with a satellite for a programme called Jumpstart, which would be selected a few weeks before launch. Trailblazer was chosen in late May, over two other options, PnPSat, or a pair of CubeSats. The launch was at that time scheduled for late June, but it was subsequently delayed due to small cracks in one of the rocket's engines.\nToday's launch followed an eventful countdown, lasting almost to the end of the five hour launch window, with the loading of helium onto the rocket taking longer than expected, and requiring several long holds. Following this, an attempt to launch was made at 03:00 GMT, which resulted in a last-second abort at T-0, just after ignition of the main engine, due to a marginal performance issue with the turbopump. The launch was recycled, and the rocket lifted off 34 minutes later.\nThis was the first flight of an uprated version of the Merlin engine, which powers the first stage. The new version, named Merlin-1C, features regenerative cooling as opposed to ablative cooling used on the earlier launches. It is believed that the failure of the launch was unrelated to the presence of the new engine, the performance of which was described as \"picture-perfect\" by Elon Musk, the CEO of SpaceX.\nThe next Falcon 1 launch was scheduled to have been launched in September with the Razaksat spacecraft for ATSB of Malaysia, and up to three CubeSats. This will almost certainly be delayed whilst the failure is investigated. It is unclear whether this failure will affect the maiden flight of the larger Falcon 9, currently scheduled for 2009, on a demonstration mission for NASA's Commercial Orbital Transportation Services programme. Today's launch is the 38th orbital launch of 2008, and following the resale and recovery of the AMC-14 satellite, the first outright failure of the year."}

It turned out to be fine spray from a hydraulic fluid leak, and the aircraft brought its 200 passengers back down safely at around 3:00 p.m., with ARFF trucks on standby.\nDespite the aircraft being forced to turn around, the pilot did not request a priority landing and so Qantas refused to describe the event as an emergency landing.\nQantas has a largely good safety record, having never lost a jet aircraft or had a fatality on board one. Their last fatal accident was in 1951. However, recently two other events have led to some questioning of Qantas from within the aviation industry.\nLast Monday, a Qantas Boeing 737-800 returned to Adelaide after experiencing pressurization problems caused by the failure of an undercarriage door to retract properly. This followed the July 25 accident on board Flight 30, a Boeing 747 headed from London to Melbourne that had just made a stopover in Hong Kong, in which an exploding oxygen cylinder caused an explosive decompression. An emergency landing was performed in Manila, with a hole blown in the aircraft's side.\nAccording to Qantas staff, the problems are not a new thing. Qantas flight attendants have asked senior management for an emergency meeting over these latest events. The Flight Attendants' Association of Australia's president Steven Reed said \"We want some assurances from the company that these are isolated incidents. Or are they something we should be concerned about? We need to meet with the company at a senior level to have these assurances.\" Such a meeting is said to be likely within a week.\nQantas engineers have been complaining for some time about maintenance issues, saying that cost-cutting and outsourcing are compromising the quality of maintenance. Much work is now being done in countries such as Hong Kong, Malaysia and the Philippines. According to one engineering union official, recent incidents linked to outsourced maintenance include a failure of emergency lighting and flight attendants in the galley being electrocuted by faulty wiring.\nAccording to the Australian Licensed Aircraft Engineers' Association's assistant federal secretary, Wayne Vasta, there has been a recent \"change in culture\" at Qantas, although he did say it would be inappropriate to blame only outsourcing. He said that while previously Qantas engineers had simply attempted to do the best they could, \"Now it appears we have got to do the best job we can possibly do, within a budget.\" He also expressed a welcoming of the CASA probe.\nQantas' engineers are currently lobbying for a pay rise, and say the airline is risking safety with cost cuts.\nPeter Gibson, spokesperson for CASA, said no trouble had been spotted in recent safety audits of Qantas, but they felt it 'prudent' to investigate given the recent string of incidents. He acknowledged that the review is unprecedented in CASA's history, and announced the probe would be headed by senior official Mick Quinn.\n\"We want to look at their safety systems to make sure that the systems are operating the way they should. All these things are stated in manuals. We want to make sure that what is in the manuals is being done,\" Gibson told reporters. He said the investigation should take around two weeks.\nSources.\n "}

This comes just after NASA stated on July 31, that Phoenix confirmed the presence of water-ice on Mars.\nRumors began to spread on the internet Saturday after an unnamed scientist working on the Phoenix Mission stated to \"Aviation Week &amp; Space Technology\", the White House had been briefed on \"provocative and complex\" information that NASA has yet to disclose to the public regarding the \"potential for life on Mars.\" The scientist said that the announcement will be regarding the habitability of Mars rather than finding actual life. The scientist also said that the information had been excluded from the July 31 press conference.\nNASA immediately denied those claims sending out a message on \"Twitter\", a social networking and micro-blogging website which is used by NASA to communicate to the public in a style pretending that the Lander itself is talking to its readers, stating, \"Heard about the recent news reports implying I may have found Martian life. Those reports are incorrect. Reports claiming there was a White House briefing are also untrue and incorrect.\" The Phoenix Lander, according to NASA, does not have the ability to detect life, past or present, but the Lander's MECA microscopy station could potentially 'see' bacteria in the soil, which NASA states have not been discovered.\n\"[The report of a White House briefing is] not true [and is] bogus\". MECA results have not been discussed at the White House. There is no one who knows either on the [Phoenix] project in Tucson or at [NASA] HQ who knows where this information came from,\" said Peter Smith, the top investigator for the Phoenix Mission. Smith also added that MECA has \"nothing new to report.\" \nThe MECA or Microscopy, Electrochemistry and Conductivity Analyzer, is designed to analyze soil samples as small as 16 \u03bcm to determine the chemical composition of the sample. While the lander were unable to image any bacteria, Phoenix's MECA did detect potassium, magnesium and chloride, minerals that are necessary to create or sustain life. MECA also determined that the soil was acidic, which means it could support the growing of some plants from Earth like asparagus.\n\"We are attempting to assess the chemicals and minerals that make up the soil composition. We are now about half way through the process and there are several conflicting points of view. This is not a good time to go public with half the story,\" added Smith who also stated that \"we are committed to following a rigorous scientific process. While we have not completed our process on these soil samples, we have very interesting intermediate results. Initial MECA analyses suggested Earth-like soil. Further analysis has revealed un-Earthlike aspects of the soil chemistry.\"\nDespite the denials by NASA, some Internet observers maintain that NASA is still preparing for a major announcement.\n\"The reason that all this seems so hush-hush is due to a future paper and press release that appears likely to pop out of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) and its Science magazine. Whatever the poop is from the scoop that\u2019s been studied by Phoenix, that information is purportedly going through peer-review\", said David Leonard for \"LifeScience.com\".\nNASA will hold a media teleconference today August 5, at 2:00 p.m. EDT, to discuss these recent science activities."}

This equates to roughly half of the instant messaging traffic during that month.\n\"To me, it was pretty shocking,\" Horvitz told \"The Washington Post\". \"What we're seeing suggests there may be a social connectivity constant for humanity. People have had this suspicion that we are really close. But we are showing on a very large scale that this idea goes beyond folklore.\"\nAccording to the BBC, the concept of \"six degrees of separation\" or \"Small world phenomenon\" was the product of research done by American Stanley Milgram in 1967 when he mailed letters from himself to a Boston stock broker. Instead of mailing them direct, he instead sent 160 people in Kansas the letters, asking them to send them to someone who might know the person in Boston. It took an average of six mailings, thus six degrees of separation. Research done in 2006 reported a 95% failure rate in these tests.\nThe theory was popularized in the 1990s when college students would play a trivia game trying to link actor Kevin Bacon with any one other answer. The person to do so in the shortest number of links won.\nIn 2003 another similar experiment was undertaken, this time via e-mail. 24,163 volunteers tried to send a message to one of 18 people all over the world. The \"Post\" reports that only 384 of the 24,163 chains were connected. That equates to about 98.5% failure rate. An estimate was made at 5 to 7 degrees of separation.\n\"To our knowledge, this is the first time a planetary-scale social network has been available to validate the well-known 'six degrees of separation' finding by Travers and Milgram,\" the researchers said according to \"The Washington Post\".\nThe research found that 78% per connected by 7 steps or less, but some were connected by as many as 29 degrees of separation, the \"Post\" said.

There was a recent study that showed I voted with the President over 90 percent of the time.\" The ad then criticizes McCain's policies on tax cuts, money for oil companies, and \"tax breaks for companies that ship jobs overseas.\"\n\"USA Today\" does note that \"[w]hile the ad shows McCain touting the fact that he had voted \"with\" President Bush more than 90% of the time, the Arizona senator did criticize the administration's conduct of the war in Iraq \u2014 calling early on for more troops to be sent there. He also voted against the president's original tax cut plan \u2014 though McCain now says he supports extending those tax cuts. And, he proposes cuts in all kinds of corporate taxes, not just those on oil companies.\"\nMcCain is set to appear at an Ohio furniture plant Wednesday to reinforce the messages in his latest advertisement.\n\"America has the second highest business tax rate in the entire world,\" he plans to say, according to prepared remarks issued by his campaign, and released by \"The Boston Globe\". \"Is it any wonder that jobs are moving overseas when we are taxing them out of the country? Unfortunately Senator Obama's plans would raise taxes on businesses even more. He has promised tax increases on income, tax increases on investment, tax increases on small businesses. This is exactly the wrong strategy. Raising taxes in a bad economy is about the worst thing you could do because it will kill even more jobs when what we need are policies that create jobs.\"\nObama spokesman Bill Burton responded:\n\"Is the biggest proponent of George Bush\u2019s tired, failed policies ready to bring about change? Another day brings another dishonest attack from John McCain. While Senator McCain knows that Senator Obama has proposed cutting taxes for 95% of American families, what he\u2019s not telling us is that he wants to give $4 billion in tax breaks to the oil companies, continue giving tax breaks to corporations that ship our job overseas, and provide no direct tax relief for more than 100 million middle-class families. It\u2019s time to retire these old policies and bring new energy to America.\""}

The execution was carried out despite being at the center of an international legal dispute with objections from the International Court of Justice (ICJ) and UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon.\nJos\u00e9 Ernesto Medell\u00edn, 33, was born in Mexico but moved to the U.S. as a child. He was sentenced to death for the 1993 rape and murder of two girls aged 14 and 16 in Houston, Texas. On Tuesday at 9:57 p.m. CDT, he was given a lethal injection at the Huntsville Unit in Huntsville, according to the Texas Department of Criminal Justice.\nIn 2004, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in The Hague told US authorities that Medell\u00edn's case and other cases of Mexicans facing execution in the U.S. may have constituted a violation of the 1963 Vienna Convention on Consular Relations. Medell\u00edn's attorneys had argued that Medell\u00edn was not informed of his right to seek legal assistance from the Mexican consulate after his arrest. The United States withdrew from compulsory ICJ jurisdiction in 1986, and therefore accepts the court's jurisdiction only on a case-to-case discretionary basis.\nThe ICJ ordered a delay in the execution, as well as new hearings for Medell\u00edn and 50 other Mexican inmates, to determine if the Vienna Convention was violated in their arrests. President George W. Bush then ordered Texas to comply with the ICJ's ruling. However, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in March that the Bush administration did not have the authority to intervene in the case.\nUN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon called on the United States to \"take every step\" to stop the execution. \"All decisions and orders of the International Court of Justice must be respected by states,\" he said in Mexico City on Tuesday, less than 12 hours before the execution took place.\nTexas governor Rick Perry denied requests from both Mexican and American officials to delay the execution, citing the manner in which the victims were raped and strangled as justification for the death penalty. \"After reviewing all of the facts in what is the most gruesome death penalty case I have reviewed since being in office, I have decided not to grant Jos\u00e9 Medell\u00edn a 30-day reprieve,\" Perry said.\nMedell\u00edn's attorneys appealed to the Supreme Court to delay the execution until Congress had an opportunity to pass legislation that would require new hearings for Medell\u00edn and other inmates. Shortly before Medell\u00edn's execution Tuesday night, the Supreme Court denied the final request for a reprieve with a 5-4 vote.\nThe Mexican government, which opposes the death penalty, has sent a letter of protest to the U.S. State Department, expressing concern for \"the precedent that [the execution] may create for the rights of Mexican nationals who may be detained\" in the United States."}

At that time he will still be considered an enemy combatant, but he will be eligible for review by an Administrative Review Board.\" \nAfter hearing the sentence Hamdan said to the jurors, \"I would like to apologise one more time to all the members and I would like to thank you for what you have done for me.\" He smiled and thanked those in the courtroom as he left.\nThe ten-day trial was the first to test the Bush Administration's military-tribunal system for people suspected of terrorism. The trial allowed evidence which would not be allowed in either a civilian or a military court, including hearsay as evidence for the conviction of Hamdan.\nThe original charges to Hamdan included five counts of supporting terrorism, but the judge, Navy Capt. Keith Allred, ordered only one count factor into the sentencing. Allred summarized the charge as \"driving Mr. bin Laden around Afghanistan\".\nHamdan will have at least two appeals \u2014 one to the person appointed to oversee the tribunals, and one to a military appeals court \u2014 and possibly more at a later date.\nPentagon spokesman Bryan Whitman told Reuters that the military plans to move forward with trials for 20 other suspected terrorists at Guantanamo, including five facing execution if convicted in connection with planning the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks in New York City and Washington, D.C..\nThe United States has tried Hamdan before, once being appealed to the United States Supreme Court.

Johnson, 38, of Kingsford, Michigan was charged on Wednesday with killing three teenagers in a shooting on the Menominee River near Niagara, Wisconsin. The charges consist of three counts of first-degree intentional homicide. Authorities say that Johnson went to the popular bathing spot near the East Kingsford Railroad Bridge on July 31 and opened fire with a military-style rifle, killing three and injuring one.\nThe Associated Press reports that he faces life in prison without parole if convicted; Wisconsin does not have the death penalty. However, as one of the bodies was found on the Michigan side of the border, he could potentially face charges there, or perhaps even in federal court. He is being represented by a public defender, Len Kachinsky.\nLocal teens said Johnson was often seen at the site, but mostly kept to himself. On July 31, he emerged from the woods wearing camouflage clothing and opened fire without saying a word. Johnson fled and surrendered the next day after a multi-agency manhunt. Johnson had been accused of a sexual assault, and his mother speculated he may have panicked after hearing police wanted to speak with him.\nIn a confession to police, Johnson said the shooting was set in motion when he lured a woman to the bridge the day before and sexually assaulted her. Worried that he would be arrested, Johnson returned to the woods, planning to ambush law enforcement officers coming to find him. After he spent a night in the woods and no officers came, he returned home at 10 a.m. local time on July 31, asked his mother if police had been looking for him, then left at 3:00 p.m.\nHe reportedly said that he then got his weapons and returned to the woods. He planned to wait for the teens to reach the Michigan side of the river so he could kill them all and use them as \"bait\" to lure police into his ambush. However, Spigarelli and Pohlson unexpectedly approached his position, and he said he felt trapped and so opened fire. Spigarelli and Pohlson were both shot in the head and died instantly. Johnson then reloaded and fired across the river, killing Bryan Mort. \nHis mother has said that Johnson's wife left with their kids, and he had been living with his mother since 2001. She said he was honorably discharged from the military in 1994 and had been unemployed. The Detroit Free Press reported that he had been planning the ambush for years."}

Without any electrical power, the pilot was unable to use his radio to contact air traffic control. He was briefly able to re-establish contact with the tower using his cell phone, but that was also disrupted. \nThe report into the incident published on August 6 revealed how a quick-thinking air traffic controller in Cork started sending directions to the pilot by text message. With this assistance, the plane, with five people on board, landed safely after the undercarriage was lowered manually and air traffic control visually confirmed that it was down. Prior to lowering the undercarriage, the first officer noticed that the nose wheel had failed to retract fully and was actually at half its travel.\n\"In this incident the positive and proactive initiative of the ATC controller, who, on realising that mobile audio communication from the pilot was intermittent, quickly switched to texting his instructions instead\", said John Hughes, an air accident investigator who reported on the incident. \"This contributed to the safe resolution of the incident and, for such, the controller should be commended for his actions.\"\nThe pilot, aged 39 and with 1,900 hours of flying experience, succeeded in climbing to an altitude of 6,500 feet without any problems, but needed to communicate to ensure a safe landing. He originally attempted to contact Kerry airport, and after that failed he made attempts to contact Cork. \nThe report found that the loss of electrical power was due to the aircraft's alternators failing to maintain the required voltage, probably due to the battery voltage being insufficient to excite the alternator's windings. The relay may have been in poor condition after having been subjected to a heavy load following take-off, possibly contributing to the incident."}
