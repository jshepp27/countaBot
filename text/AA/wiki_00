Titled \"Choosing Health\", the paper details government plans to restrict smoking in public places, limit 'junk food' advertisements to children, make available \"lifestyle trainers\", campaign against sexually transmitted diseases and tobacco, and improve food labelling.\nThe white paper comes after extensive public comment that involved 150,000 people.\nSmoking would be restricted in enclosed public spaces, restaurants, workplaces, and some pubs. The ban would be enacted gradually, affecting government and NHS buildings in 2006, enclosed public places in 2007, and private property in 2008. Permanent exemption would be granted to pubs that do not serve prepared food -- though not at the bar -- as well as private clubs, a decision that has provoked some to call the measure incomplete. Up to 90% of pubs are expected to be affected. The Scottish executive proposed a complete ban on smoking in enclosed public places last week, and Ireland has already banned smoking in pubs and restaurants.\nFood advertisements targeted to children would be banned until 9pm, under the White Paper's proposals. The restriction is a measure to tackle rising rates of childhood obesity. The government also intends to develop voluntary standards on food and drink advertisements to children with industry, only threatening legislation if an acceptable standard is not reached by 2007. Additionally, low income families would receive vouchers for fresh fruit, vegetables, milk, and infant formula. School lunches would also be held to stricter nutritional standards. Reid has warned that unless childhood obesity is tackled, \"we face the prospect of children having shorter life expectancy than their parents\".\nFood labelling would also be improved, with a \"traffic light\" system implemented. Packaged food would be evaluated based on its fat, sugar, and salt content.\nThe paper is unusual for suggesting a more holistic approach to health care, offering for the first time \"lifestyle trainers.\" The National Health Service would be funding with an additional \u00a31bn to make people's overall lives healthier, which is expected to save \u00a330bn in preventable illness.\nThe paper additionally makes mention of reducing accidents, which affected 2.7m people last year and is a leading cause of child death, curb binge drinking, and reduce substance abuse among youths.\nThe paper has been criticized by many parties. The Tory Shadow Health Secretary has criticized the Labour government's comprehensiveness and creation of a \"new nanny state approach\". He has additionally described it as \"gimmicks\". The Liberal Democrats have accused the government of not being comprehensive enough. It has also been criticized by the British Medical Association as being implemented too slowly, saying \"When lives need saving, doctors act immediately\".\nMr. Reid has argued against the nanny state label, saying \"In a free society, men and women ultimately have the right within the law to choose their own lifestyle, even when it may damage their own health. But people do not have the right to damage the health of others, or to impose an intolerable degree of inconvenience or nuisance on others ... This is a sensible solution which balances the protection of the majority with the personal freedom of the minority in England\".\nThe full white paper \"Choosing Health\" can be read here."}

China has also been criticized by Japanese Foreign Minister Nobutaka Machimura for not being sufficiently cooperative with regards to environmental issues, which necessarily affect its eastern neighbor Japan. \nThe People's Republic of China's Communist leaders have also been criticized for violating w:human rights and effecting a military build-up. Some argue that economic aid should be tied to compliance on relevant standards.\nThrough the ODA, Japan enjoys the support of many developing nations in UN votes. When China did not react favorably to Japan's intention to seek permanent UN Security Council membership, \"The Japan Times\" criticized the aid as a \"complete waste\".\n\"Asia Times Online\" predicts \"it is inevitable that funds flowing to China are set for further downsizing.\"\nTotal Japanese expenditures on ODA have reached $221bn distributed to 185 nations. Currently, the biggest recipient of Japan's ODA aid is India. Japan may soon be outspent in aid to China by France, Germany and Italy."}

Military advisors pressured for a preemptive strike, which was felt necessary to offset Israeli numerical inferiority. Then-Prime Minister Levi Eshkol was under intense pressure from his cabinet and military on the decision to pursue diplomacy or war. Many pro-war officials considered war inevitable and a delay only harmful to Israel.\nAriel Sharon was a Major General in the Israeli military during the war. On May 28th, he advised the Chief of Staff Yitzhak Rabin that the cabinet could be detained and a coup declared. Sharon and others felt that the civilian government was unable to reach a necessary decision. The military would make the decision the government would not, and begin war in the government's best interests.\nHe explains: \"We often asked whether in the State of Israel there could arise a situation in which the army takes control. And I always said it was impossible, that this couldn't happen in the State of Israel.\"\n\"And then, after the meeting on May 28, I said to the chief of staff and others who were present, that there had arisen a situation in which this could happen, and that it would also be well accepted - that is to say, to seize control not in the framework of wanting to govern, but in the framework of making a decision, the fundamental decision, and that [the] army can make it without the government.\"\n\"I don't remember if he agreed or not, but I think he also viewed it in this way.\"\nSharon stressed that no definite plan existed. However, he defended giving it serious consideration, saying: \"They [the civilian government] would have accepted it with a sense of relief. That was my feeling.\"\nPrime Minister Eshkol later decided in favor of war on June 5th. Ariel Sharon served as a commander of the Southern Division.

The submarine was quickly spotted by Japan's Self-Defence Forces and was tracked by helicopter as it wandered in Japanese waters for two hours before moving north-west. International law requires a tracked submarine to surface and identify its nationality in times of peace; the submarine did not do so.\nMany Japanese officials in the Defence Agency considered the intrusion an act of provocation and \"showing off,\" as the submarine in question was a particularly noisy model. It continued traveling very slowly after being spotted, and remained in shallow waters. The intrustion caused Japanese Self-Defense Forces to go on alert for the second time since the Second World War.\nThe submarine in question is believed to be a Type 09-1 Han Class attack submarine. It is a nuclear-powered submarine designed in the 1950s and first built in the 1974. This class of submarine is thought to suffer numerous defects, including radiation leakage, noise, and an inability to fire missiles while submerged. Only two of five submarines are thought to be operational. China has recently begun an active modernization of its navy.\nOn 17 November, Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Wu Daiwei met with the Japanese ambassador to China Anami Koreshige in Beijing and offered an apology for the incident, stating that the submarine was on a training mission and the intrusion was due to a \"technical error\" and was \"regrettable.\" Japan's Defence Agency is studying whether \"technical errors\" is a feasible explanation for the incident.\nJapanese Prime Minister Koizumi Junichiro has publicly stated he wishes to speak with Chinese President Hu Jintao about this and other matters of Sino-Japanese contention at the upcoming annual Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Chile later this month.\nDespite the increasingly close economic ties between the two nations, distrust has long exisited between Japan and China. Many Chinese people still resent the Japanese invasion and occupation of China during World War II and Japan's refusal to formally apologise. Japan, on the other hand, sees China as a potential competitor and an increasing threat to its national security.\nJapan's Constitution forbids the nation from exercising military strength in matters other than that of self-defence, but Japan's ruling party, the Liberal Democratic Party or LDP, has recently proposed constitutional amendments to give the military more offensive capabilities, among other things."}

Indymedia reports 20 people were arrested in acts of nonviolent civil disobedience. \nAmong the crowd were celebrity-actors Martin Sheen and Susan Sarandon; Sarandon narrated the 1997 documentary \"School of Assassins\" about the school's history. Indymedia web site quotes Elizabeth Nadeau, a 27-year-old student, as saying \"Prison will not deter us. We will be here until we close the school and change the foreign policy that it represents.\"\nIn 1946 the military Latin American Training Center U.S. Ground Forces was established in Panama; in 1949 it became the U.S. Army Caribbean Training Center and during 1963 the training center expanded and became the U.S. Army School of the Americas (USARSA or SOA). The SOA mission was to counter the influence of Communism in the region, and to assist Latin-American nations in fighting armed Communist movements. In 1984 the school was moved to Fort Benning, near Columbus. At the end of 2000, the SOA was closed as its reason of existence as an anti-Communist school was rendered unnecessary. In 2001, the Western Hemisphere Institute for Security Cooperation was opened in the same location. WHINSEC offers training to Latin American military and civilian forces in combat, counter-narcotics, and counter-insurgency techniques, with training completed mainly in the Spanish language.\nActivists claim that both SOA (in the past, during 80's) and WHINSEC (at present day) trained militias in tactics of violence that are/were used against political dissidents in their native countries. They accuse SOA graduates of been responsible of death squads, drug deals, murders, rape and torture. They say the school is responsible by these acts and that many techniques of torture its graduated students have used in their countries had been learned at the military American school. A list of allegeds SOA graduated students's crimes can be seen at the Virtual Truth Commission, an anti-SOA webpage.\nPro-SOA say the school was important in the maintenance of the security in the Latin America and United States during Cold War. A list of death victims by communist groups between 1935-1972 only in Brazil can be seen at the Ternuma (Terrorism never), a Brazilian alleged anti-terrorism webpage. Also, the US Department of Defense maintains a list of significant terrorist incidents between 1961-2003, among them are several crimes committed by communist groups. The UK version of IndyMedia distributes a copy in English of the Manual of the Urban Guerrilla which details techniques of urban terrorism for communism, written by Carlos Marighella, a communism fighter. The Cuban dictator Fidel Castro advocated armed revolutionary struggle in Latin America. The USSR or Soviet Union gave trainning, military and economic help through Cuba to various communists groups in American continent. \nThe protest at Fort Benning which involved a mock funeral procession is an annual event organized by the School of Americas Watch (SOAW) to commemorate the first assassination attributed to school's graduates, the November 16 1989, killing of six Salvadoran Jesuit priests, their housekeeper, and her teenage daughter, at the University of Central America (UCA). Of the 27 soldiers cited for that killing by a 1993 UN Truth Commission, 19 were SOA graduates. SOAW lists 11 former Latin American dictators as graduates of the School. USA deny they supported dictators and they protest against Fidel Castro, the long-time dictator of Cuba, who has received support, military and economic help from USSR for a long time.\nSOA officials say thousands of soldiers have been trained and about 300 of them have been accused of human rights violations. \"The connections that critics make between the school and the crimes allegedly committed by its graduates are tenuous at best\", says Joe Leuer - who worked at SOA.\nPro-military activists planned a concurrent gathering called \"God Bless Fort Benning Celebration,\" to honor the soldiers and history of the military base where WHINSEC is located. \"If they have 10,000, then we have 10,001,\" organizer Miriam Tidwell told Associated Press. Unverified reports of this counter-demonstration put attendance figures between 10,000 and 15,000.\nWHINSEC operates with an annual budget of approximately $8 million, the school curriculum now includes a mandated 8 hours of training in human rights which includes \"human rights, rule of law, due process, civilian control of the military, and the role of the military in a democratic society.\""}

Because the PSD+PUR coalition did not gather the majority of the votes (50%+1), it will have to form a governing coalition with the minor parties, a process which is expected to be tedious given the fact that both of the major parties have ruled out entering into a coalition with ultra-nationalist The Greater Romania Party, which obtained around 12% of the vote."}

It uses very high-temperature electrolysis to separate hydrogen from water, so that hydrogen may be used for energy production.\nElectrolysis is one method by which laboratories and factories produce hydrogen. An electrical current is passed through water, breaking it down into hydrogen and oxygen gas, which are then collected above the water reservoir.\nResearchers in Salt Lake City, Utah, at \"Ceramtech Incorporated\", in collaboration with workers at \"The Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory\" report that when water is superheated to 800 degrees Celsius, far less electricity is required to produce the same volume of hydrogen. The researchers envision that future nuclear fission plants could be used both to heat the water as part of their cooling system, and generate the needed electricity.\nConcerns have been raised regarding the safety of such arrangements, however. Jeremy Desterhoft, an independent consultant on nuclear energy safety, warns the \"elevated levels of radiation required to sufficiently lower the atomic separation point is beyond the current capabilities of any recent cooler.\" He does not believe that economically viable cooling technology will be available for at least four to six more years."}

The last entry, which has since been removed from public view, was posted on November 18, 2004 and read:\nJust to let everyone know, my mother was murdered.\n\"I won't have computer acess \"[sic] \"until the weekend or so because the police took my computer to go through the hard drive. I thank everyone for their thoughts and e-mails, I hope to talk to you when I get my computer back.\"\nA diverse group of users, both friends and strangers, have posted over 5,000 comments on the journal, positive and negative, transforming the case into an Internet phenomenon. Every entry since March 2004 has apparently now been deleted or hidden, but a ZIP archive of the entire weblog, from before the entries were deleted, is available on Deadly Blogging.\nWaterman was a tenth-grade honor (A-average) student in her second year at Craig High School. She was also a member of the Academic Decathlon team (ACDC) and sang in the choir, a profile that has left many people questioning her involvement in the killing and asking what motive there might be. At the time police say the killing occurred, Rachelle Waterman was apparently playing in a volleyball tournament in Anchorage, Alaska.\nApart from the online diary Rachelle kept, the case is also unusual because matricide committed by female minors is extremely rare.\nFamily background.\nThe Waterman family is a locally prominent, middle-upper class family. Born on August 26, 1988, Rachelle showed an interest in acting, computers, movies and music, and was an honor roll student, involved in many extra-curricular activities, including choir, volleyball, and the decathlon team - advancing to upper levels and winning prizes in almost every endeavor. Her mother, Lauri, was a teachers' aide and served on the board of the Little League and the town library. Rachelle Waterman's 60-year-old father, Carl \"Doc\" Waterman, is a real estate agent and serves as president of the Craig School Board. Rachelle's older brother, Geoffrey, lives out of town and is a student at Tacoma College.\nThe case.\nWaterman and her alleged accomplices, Jason Arrant and Brian Radel, both 24 years old, are accused of murdering and conspiring to murder Waterman's 48-year-old mother, Lauri Waterman.\nReportedly, Arrant dropped Radel off near the Waterman home shortly after 12:00 a.m. Sunday, November 13, 2004 (local time) where Radel proceeded to kidnap Lauri Waterman, force her into a minivan owned by the Waterman family, and kill her with a blunt object.\nArrant and Radel then allegedly met at Forest Service Road 3012 at about 2:30 a.m., and Arrant followed Radel to its dead end, where Radel had driven the Waterman's van.\nArrant then allegedly watched as Radel doused the body and van with gasoline and then used a roll of paper towels to set it on fire, in an attempt to destroy the evidence.\nPolice investigation.\nAlaska State Police Lt. Rodney Dial has stated that a hunter discovered Lauri Waterman's body and her burnt-out van, while driving on Forest Service Road 3012, a remote logging road, early in the afternoon of Sunday November 142004.\nOn Saturday, November 202004, Alaska State Police Trooper Robert Claus stated:\nDuring ... interviews all three made admissions as to their involvement in the murder. Physical evidence recovered at the various crime scenes corroborated many of the defendants' statements ... Radel, Arrant and Waterman have been charged with murder in the first degree. Due to the severity of the charges, Waterman has been waived into adult court. Additional charges of solicitation, conspiracy, tampering with physical evidence and other charges are pending. Arrant and Waterman will be arraigned in the District Court in Craig this morning.\nArraignment.\nOn Saturday, November 20, 2004, Rachelle appeared in Craig District Court, dressed in an orange CCJF jumpsuit, for arraignment on the charges. Waterman and her alleged co-conspirators, Jason Arrant, and Brian Radel, faced a 10-count indictment, listing 26 felonies.\nThe Fairbanks Daily News-Miner reported that, \"the complaint against Rachelle Waterman relied on statements by all three co-defendants. The complaint says the girl told one of the suspects when she and her father would be out of town.\"\nA report in The Ketchikan Daily News stated that, \"The first seven counts of the indictment allege that all three defendants committed the crimes of conspiracy to commit first-degree murder; first-degree murder; second-degree murder; kidnapping; first-degree burglary; first-degree vehicle theft and tampering with physical evidence.\" Other charges were made against Arrant and Radel. The same report went on to state, \"Trooper Robert Claus, Klawock resident Jan Bush and Deputy State Medical Examiner Susan Klingler testified before the grand jury.\"\nMagistrate Kay Clark presided over the arraignment and set bail at $150,000. Clark also appointed a public defender to represent Rachelle, who was sent to the Juneau Department of Corrections facility.\nThe trial.\nJudge Patricia Collins, of the Juneau Superior Court, has been assigned to run the trial for the case. Judge Collins originally set a date of February 3, 2005 for the trial, but, at an arraignment that week, the trial was rescheduled for August 22. According to court officials, another postponement is likely.\nRachelle Waterman's court-appointed attorney for the trial is Assistant Public Advocate Steven Wells. Assistant District Attorney Daniel Schally is assigned to prosecute the case.\nAlleged motive.\nNo motive for the crime has been suggested. Readers are closely scrutinizing Rachelle's online journal for clues.\nAs early as February 24th of 2004, she posted the following:\nNumerous readers have pointed to Rachelle's negative comments concerning her mother's wishes to send her to a \"fat farm\" to lose weight.\nIn another incident, her mother grounded her (restricted her to home) for receiving an 89% score on a test. Rachelle posted these comments to her journal in response to this situation (verbatim spelling):\nOther readers have pointed to the title of Rachelle's journal, \"My Crappy Life (The Inside Look of an Insane Person)\", and her negative description of her hometown as \"Hell, Alaska, United States\":\nRachelle posted the following poem to her journal on August 24, 2004, with an indication that she was depressed:\nShe also had a strong desire not to be at home:\nand even posted an \"Ode to Suicide\" under the following post:\nFinally, the weekend before Rachelle left on a trip, during which time her mother was allegedly killed, she noted in her second-to-last entry, \"I had a migraine from about 9am-6pm\".\nIncarceration.\nRachelle Waterman is currently incarcerated at the Lemon Creek correctional facility, in Alaska. She signed an agreement to be placed into the general population. Corrections Deputy Commissioner Portia Parker indicated that Waterman \"is an adult in the eyes of the law.\"\nAlaska law places persons charged with first-degree murder at the age of 16 or older in the adult court system, and most of the records concerning this case are open to the public for inspection.\nAftermath.\nOne of the last entries in Rachelle's journal wonders whether anyone is reading her comments (verbatim spelling):\nAlthough Waterman has not yet been convicted, sociologists and forensic psychologists are beginning to study her journal and the circumstances of her writing it. (The police have seized her computer and are examining the contents of its hard drive for evidence.)\nLiveJournal has subsequently restricted the viewing of her journal.\nWhen interviewed by Alaskan television station KTUU about the nature of online journals, (in late November, 2004) forensic psychologist Susan LaGrande commented that \"[i]t's such an anonymous vehicle that you can be whoever or say whatever you want. You don't have all the responsibilities that are inherent in a face-to-face real, legitimate relationship.\nThis same report pointed out that Rachelle Waterman had mentioned suicide in her online journal.\nJuvenile crime.\nCriminologist Susan Magestro was interviewed by KTUU on the subject of juvenile crime, in late November, 2004, after Waterman became the second teenager within two months to be accused of murdering her own parent. She stated that \"I think that we're starting to see more violence with kids who are younger, and the behaviors that they're exhibiting are more aggressive and more violent.\" Magestro also opined that \"we've got a lot more fetal alcohol and drug children who are growing up, and they don't understand the consequences of some of their actions.\" (There is no indication that Waterman was a so-called \"fetal alcohol\" or \"drug\" child.)\nKTUU reported that Magestro \"...blames violent movies, TV shows and videogames for desensitizing young people, making them unable to understand the consequences -- or even the reality -- of their actions.\" \nAlthough Waterman has been waived into the adult justice system due to the nature of the crime, the Governor of Alaska, Frank Murkowski, has proposed increasing the number of personnel assigned to the juvenile justice system."}

Such a tactic would increase the bandwidth costs for these websites. However, it also faces legal questions.\nSpamming, the mass sending of unsolicited emails, is lucrative in part because each email can be sent for nearly insignificant costs. With such low costs, a commercial spammer needs only to have a very small number of recipients buy their product to make a profit. The goal of many anti-spam proposals has been to increase the cost of spammers sending messages. Lycos' approach is to make it more expensive to maintain servers that send spam.\nVolunteers may download the screensaver from the Lycos website for it. The program would run on a user's computer in the background and request about three megabytes (3MBs) of data every day. The screensaver shows which spam server is being targeted by the user, where the server is located, and how many others are attacking it at that moment. Target email servers are selected from blacklists from anti-spam organizations, with Lycos' own verification.\nLegal issues arise over whether this can be interpreted as a denial of service attack. In such an attack, computers overwhelm a webserver with requests for data to the point where it does not have the resources to fulfill its normal function. Lycos, in explanatory material on the screensaver's dedicated website ( http://makelovenotspam.com ), claims that its technology closely monitors the screensavers' effects on targeted websites and prevents any of them from being completely shut down by information requests. \nLycos Europe operates in Germany where, according to Joerg Heidrich of Heise Zeitschriften Verlag, less than completely shutting down a server is not clearly illegal under the penal code. It may, however, be actionable under the civil code. But Lycos may be betting that no one will file a suit, as that would require those participating in illegal spamming to reveal their identity.\nThe website no longer allows downloads of the screensaver, and users of the screensaver cannot connect to spam sites, but are instead given the message 'Stay Tuned'"}

ASEAN members include Myanmar, Laos, Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam, Philippines, Malaysia, Brunei Darussalam, Singapore and Indonesia.\nIn the last four years China has become a major importer of oil and commodities, and a major exporter of finished goods. China has also strengthened relationships with oil suppliers in the Middle East and Africa. This pact lifts trade restrictions and removes tariffs from many imports and exports. It also allows China to continue manipulating the value of its currency in its own interests. The yuan is currently undervalued, making Chinese-made goods artificially cheap for foreign importers. \nStated in the agreement is ASEAN's intention to create a unified economy--and by implication polity--similar to the EU. This agreement will cement China's role as the center of the South Asian regional economy, and at the same time strengthening bonds between China and other countries in the region and ease their suspicions over a growing superpower.\nJapanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi and South Korean President Roh Moo-Hyun separately adopted accords with the 10-nation Association of Southeast Asian Nations, agreeing to launch the talks early next year.

Previous efforts to achieve a compromise failed because Unionists claimed insufficiently large amounts of IRA weaponry had been decommissioned, and that there was insufficient evidence that the weapons had in fact been destroyed.\nSome Unionists are insisting on photographic evidence of the destruction of IRA weapons, a request that is bound to be resisted by more militant Republicans.

The report details communication failures with the Muslim\nworld, and notes that current efforts may have achieved the opposite\nof their intended effect.\nThe report released without publicity the Wednesday before Thanksgiving by Defense Science Board, focuses on a failure of communication, which the Defense Science Board considers vital to the war on terror. It asserts this failure of \"strategic communication\" contributes to a perceived \"negative image in world opinion and diminished ability to persuade\" of the United States, and that a resulting atmosphere of hostility can manifest in numerous ways.\nThe list of harmful effects includes \"terrorism, thin coalitions, harmful effects on business, restrictions\non travel, declines in cross border tourism and education flows, and\ndamaging consequences for other elements of U.S. soft power\".\nAccording to the report, \"The information campaign ... is an essential objective, because the larger goals of U.S. strategy depend on separating the vast majority of non-violent Muslims from the radical-militant Islamist-Jihadists. But American efforts have not only failed in this respect: they may also have achieved the opposite of what they intended.\"\nBy way of example, the report quotes figures from a June 2004 Zogby poll, claiming to show a significant drop in Arab support for the U.S. in the past couple years. Statistical results are reproduced below.\nThe report further claims, \"American direct intervention in the Muslim World has paradoxically elevated the stature of and support for radical Islamists.\" As summarised in a \"Christian Science Monitor\" headline, 'They hate our policies, not our freedom'.\nSo why has support for the U.S. dropped? -- to single digits in some Arab nations. President Bush and others have famously claimed that America is hated for its freedom. But the Defense Science Board concluded that most Arabs \"do not hate us for our values, but because of our policies.\" From the same Zogby study:\nThis study explains that while support for American values may not be overwhelming, it is practically non-existent for America's policies in the Middle East.\n\"The overwhelming majority voice their objections to what they see as one-sided support in favor of Israel and against Palestinian rights, and the longstanding, even increasing support for what Muslims collectively see as tyrannies, most notably Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Pakistan, and the Gulf states. Thus when American public diplomacy talks about bringing democracy to Islamic societies, this is seen as no more than self-serving hypocrisy.\"\nIn the eyes of Muslims, according to this report, America is really only looking out for its own interests.\nIt concludes from this that the fundamental problem with relations with the Muslim world is not a simple matter of crafting the right message. \"Rather, it is a fundamental problem of credibility.

The explosions claimed no casualties, but two police officers were lightly wounded.\nAn anonymous caller contacted the Basque newspaper Gara at 5.30pm local time, describing the location of the devices and naming ETA as responsible for the attacks. The bombings caused city-wide traffic jams, as police and rescue forces raced to secure the targets. The attacks ended a relatively peaceful phase of several months in the conflict between the Spanish central government and Basque extremists.\nWhile leaders of ETA's political arm Batasuna have recently hinted at the possibility of a ceasefire, the assault makes any form of dialogue with ETA unlikely in the near future. ETA is considered a terrorist organization by the United States and the European Union."}

The Boeing Delta IV Heavy has missed launch opportunities three days in a row (starting Friday, December 12) due to minor technical difficulties. It is now scheduled to launch Dec. 20 or 21 from pad SLC-37B.\nThe Delta 4 was developed as part of the U.S Air Force's \"Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle\" program to reduce costs and improve reliability. The basic design is a two stage, cryogenic LOx/LH2 rocket. Strap-on boosters may be added to increase lift capacity. \nTwo major obstacles have plagued the project in recent years; a bidding scandal which cost Boeing a large portion of the military satellite launch business for which it was competing, and a downturn in commercial satellite launches in 2001.\nThe \"Heavy\" variant of the Delta 4 rocket can place 13,100 kg (28,950 Lb) into geostationary transfer orbit, greater than any other current rocket. Two additional first stage cores are used as strap-on boosters for this configuration. Their rated thrust is 2,900,000 N (656,000 lb) each. \nDelta 4's main engine, the RS68, is the most powerful hydrogen/liquid oxygen engine in the world, approximately three times as powerful as the Ariane 5 Vulcain HM60. Its design sacrifices efficiency for increased reliability and lower cost: rated specific impulse is 365s at sea level and 410s in a vacuum. The second stage engine, Pratt and Whitney's RL-10B-2, has a specific impulse of 462s.\nThe primary market for this launcher will be classified spy satellites for the US intelligence community. Most of these satellites were previously launched on the Titan 4, which has since been retired. The Delta 4 Heavy's published launch cost is $170 million, compared to the Titan 4's $400 million (1999 dollars).\nDelta 4 Heavy's maiden launch is a demonstration and will carry a dummy load and two nano-satellites. The main payload, dubbed \"DemoSat\" is a 6020 kg (13271 lb) mass designed to simulate the dynamic and initial properties of a real satellite. Its design consists of large brass rods, intended to fully burn up on reentry.\nThe two nano-satellites are part of the US Department of Defense \"Nanosat-2 Program\", and built by students from New Mexico State University, Arizona State University, and the University of Colorado at Boulder."}

They have concluded that human influence makes extremely warm summers (i.e. summers as warm as the 2003 heatwave) more than twice as likely.\nCommentators have suggested that in the future this may open the way for lawsuits against heavy polluters by persons whose livelihoods have been affected by adverse climate change. However, the report stesses that though it is in fact impossible to pin any specific extreme climate event on either global warming or natural climate variation, human activities increase the frequency of such events.\nThe study is based upon climate activity during the last 50 years, which can only be replicated with computer models which include human forcing (CO2 and other greenhouse gases (GHGs)). However, even within a warmer world the summer of 2003 was anomalously warm in Europe. Most simulations of 2003 climate produce cooler weather in Europe than what actually happened. It is not yet known if flaws in the models cause this difference, if the warmth of 2003 was part of a trend, or 2003 was merely unusually hot. If there will be a warming trend, a model predicts that such summers could become an event of 1-in-2 probability only by 2050.\nIn the Americas, a series of sudden weather changes has been more frequent in the last 15 years since the discovery of the phenomenon knows as \"El Ni\u00f1o\", in which vast regions of North and South America suffered weather extremes ranging from high tides to extreme hail, rain and snowstorms during summer and winter seasons following extremely hot summers. There's still no scientific evidence that \"El Ni\u00f1o\" is directly influenced by human factors."}

The farm was considered at risk of invasion due to its proximity to a MST encampment. \nNunes and another employee of Noroeste Farm known as \"Coco\" were on a motorcycle when they were allegedly attacked. MST members allegedly extended barbed wire across the road to down the two men, who were then pummelled with axes and sticks. Coco escaped to a Cabixi police station but Nunes was rendered unconscious and did not survive the assault.\nMST is a large Marxist-Maoist inspired movement of agricultural workers in Brazil, officially founded in 1984. The movement claims to pursue equitable redistribution of Brazilian farmland. In 2003 there were 632 MST camps in Brazil, containing 116,382 families. According to a recent report on labor standards in Brazil, conditions for laborers are poor. Currently, MST receives financial help from the Brazilian government and donations from international organizations. The movement also receives funds by selling videos of their invasions and other products like books, flags and caps. \nMST's most visible tactic has been their armed occupation of mostly privately-held plantations and landholdings. However, some Brazilians have protested MST's use of violence. Many farms hire gunfighters to protect their properties from invasions as MST is known to permanently evict farmholders. MST claims they use arms only to defend themselves from the gunfighters. "}

The move has been called a \"goodwill gesture\" towards Muslims.\nUp to 120 million such paper sculptures were dropped on Thailand's three southern-most provinces, Narathiwat, Pattani and Yala. Tensions in this area have increased recently, peaking with the recent death of 85 demonstrators arrested during a protest. The government blamed their deaths on physical weakness due to fasting in the month of Ramadan as the cause, as most if not all the deaths occurred during transport of up to 500 arrested protestors. Critics of the Thai government have called for the resignation of Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, blaming the \"over-eagerness\" of Thai security forces as the cause of the deaths.\nThe dispersal was timed to coincide with the birthday of Thailand's King Bhumibol Adulyadej, and has generated much interest from the rest of the country's predominantly Buddhist population. \nThe cranes were built by citizens throughout Thailand and had peace messages written on them. The southern, Muslim provinces are often considered neglected by a north that is larger and of the majority ethnic group. Some have welcomed the goodwill gesture, but critics in both the north and south have said that the resources would have been better spent solving the problems in the south. Some Islamic leaders in the south have also expressed concerns that the gesture may not be properly understood by Muslims, as the crane carries no cultural significance with them."}

The report, \"Drugs and Democracy in Latin America: The Impact of U.S. Policy\" (Summary, PDF), investigated \"the impact of drug control policies on human rights and democracy\" and declared that present policies in the War on Drugs have failed to achieve any meaningful success.\nThe United States government's primary aim in the War on Drugs is to reduce the volume of illegal narcotics imported into the United States. By reducing imports, prices of the drugs will rise and, so the government reasons, drug use will decline. The government's efforts are primarily directed towards eradication of crops used to produce finished drugs, and towards strengthening the governments of regions in which drugs are produced by offering military and financial aid, the most notable of which is Colombia.\nThe 400-page WOLA report documents evidence that U.S. efforts to combat illegal drugs in the Americas have served to weaken democratic instutions in Latin America, and have placed the burden of the drug war upon the poorest of their citizens. Co-editor of the report, Coletta A. Youngers maintains that the U.S. policy of crop eradication generates \"social unrest, instability and violence\" as poor farmers are having their source of income destroyed. Youngers further states that U.S. policies \"have contributed to confusing military and law-enforcement functions, militarizing local police forces, and bringing the military into a domestic law enforcement role. They have thus strengthened military forces at the expense of civilian authorities \u2013 in a region with a tragic history of military rule\" .\nAs a measure of their success in the War on Drugs, the Office of National Drug Control Policy points to statistics from 2001, which are the most recent published on the ONDCP website, that show a decline in the worldwide level of coca cultivation . The ONDCP also claims success in interdiction efforts and highlights statistics on drug arrests within the United States as measurable achievements in the War on Drugs . \nHowever, the Drug Enforcement Agency's latest statistics (from 2003) show street prices of drugs to be near an all-time low . The same DEA report also concedes that most drugs \"are readily available\". \nWhile a senior ONDCP official has stated that the WOLA report \"is filled with errors, irrelevancies, and misinterpretations\" , WOLA has called for a renewed debate on drug war policies, supported by their findings and the latest government statistics that show illegal narcotics to be cheaper and more plentiful than ever before.\nWOLA was founded in 1974 by Joseph Eldridge, Joyce Hill of the National Council of Churches and Thomas Quigley of the U.S. Catholic Conference. Quigley led the Religious Task Force on El Salvador, part of a coalition called Committee In Solidarity With the People of El Salvador (CIPES). Papers captured in El Salvador belonging to FMLN guerrilla leader, Farid Handal, \"documented CIPES' connections with member groups of the Latin network and the international communist movement( Richard P.

Mr. Bao approached Mr. Vohor at the time to complain that the flag of Taiwan was still flying in the capital city, even after the council of ministers has already made the decision to take it down.\n\"I then approached him just outside of parliament where I waited for him again at the main entrance. He then shook his fist right in my face and punched me on my right shoulder.\" said Mr. Bao, \"I was shocked at what happened, but his bodyguards stepped in and the prime minister then rushed to his car. This has deeply offended me and my country.\"\nHowever Mr. Bao decided today not to file a formal protest or make a police report. The incident has been publicised on Vanuatu's local newspapers, one of which called it \"another indiscretion for which Vohor should resign\". Mr. Vohor had already faced a no-confidence vote by the opposition members of parliament before the incident for his decision to establish a diplomatic relationship with Taiwan.\nThe opposition MPs are confident that the no-confidence vote would pass in the parliament, as 16 more MPs have recently deserted Mr. Vohor and sided with the opposition, which now holds a 36 to 14 majority in the 52-member parliament, including the prime minister himself and the speaker.\nMr. Vohor has been in office for only four months and his position now seems precarious, after his secret visit to Taiwan last month. In this trip he signed a communique recognising the Republic of China (the official name of Taiwan) as a sovereign state. But the country's council of ministers, which is Vanuatu's ruling body, revoked the deal and reiterated to Beijing its commitment to the one-China policy, which is a pre-requesite for maintaining formal diplomatic ties with the People's Republic of China, which sees Taiwan as its 23rd province and the Republic of China as a defunct entity. Currently the Republic of China maintains formal diplomatic relationships with 27 countries, including Vanuatu."}

Rumsfeld, after a speech to U.S. soldiers at an American military base in Kuwait, was confronted by Iraq-bound soldiers raising their concerns over a variety of issues.\nDuring a question-and-answer session of unscreened questions following his speech at Camp Buehring, Rumsfeld replied to soldier's concerns over aging equipment and a lack of armor for military vehicles. One soldier, Spc. Thomas Wilson, received applause from the gathered troops after asking the defense secretary, \"Why do we soldiers have to dig through local landfills for pieces of scrap metal and compromised ballistic glass to up-armor our vehicles?\" Rumsfeld hesitated, then replied, \"You go to war with the Army you have, not the Army you might want or wish to have.\" Rumsfeld further clarified that the Pentagon was making all possible effort to provide the materials required as quickly as possible, but that it has been difficult to keep up with demand.\nHowever, a recent claim by a company producing such armor for the Pentagon has contradicted this assertion. \"We've been telling the Pentagon for months that we have the capacity to double our production,\" said Matt Salmon, a consultant for ArmorWorks of Tempe, AZ. ArmorWorks, which has a $30 million contract with the Pentagon to supply armor kits to be fitted on Humvee vehicles, claims to be operating at only half-capacity, with little to no interest shown by the Pentagon in increasing their output.\nRumsfeld also addressed an expressed concern regarding aging equipment by asserting that, although all units have equipment of various vintage, troops headed into a combat situation in Iraq are equipped with the newest and best equipment the military can provide .\nMaj. Gen. Gary Speer, the deputy commanding general of U.S. forces in Kuwait, stated that every vehicle deploying to Iraq from Kuwait has at least \"Level 3\" armor protection. According to Speer, this means the vehicle has locally fabricated armor for its side panels, but not bulletproof windows or reinforced floorboards. He was not aware of soldiers retrieving used bulletproof glass or scrap metal from landfills.\nIt is difficult to estimate the seriousness of the problems cited by the soldiers, and the Army claims to be unaware of widespread shortages in necessary equipment. However, enough soldiers have expressed concern () since the start of combat in Iraq to have provoked a reevalution within the military on the amount and type of protection U.S. forces require in Iraq .\nRumsfeld also faced questions from the soldiers regarding the army's 'stop-loss' policy and dismissed concerns over the allegation that Army troops receive better equipment than National Guard troops. \"No way I can prove it, but I'm told that the army is breaking its neck to see that there is not a differentiation\" in the quality of equipment.\nShortly after the speech, Rumsfeld continued on his way to Kabul to watch President Karzai be sworn in."}

David wrote Whitewashing torture?, which is an account of Sergeant Frank \"Greg\" Ford's report on Iraqi prisoner abuse at his base in Samarra, Iraq. DeBatto, a former counterintelligence officer in Iraq, is currently authoring a four-part fiction series, as well as working as a journalist.\nIn Whitewashing torture?, DeBatto explains that Sergeant Ford witnessed the torture and abuse of Iraqi detainees over a two to three week period in the spring of 2003 by his fellow intelligence operatives. Ford attempted to confront his team leader several times without success, and eventually went to his commanding officer Captain Victor Artiga in order to file a formal complaint. According to Ford, instead of an investigation being conducted, he was given thirty seconds by Captain Artiga to retract his complaint. When Ford didn't comply, he was immediately stripped of his weapon and assigned a 24-hour escort. Shortly after he was told to report to an army psychiatrist for a \"combat stress evaluation\". The psychiatrist deemed Ford to be \"completely normal\" and filed her report with Captain Artiga. \nAccording to a witness, Sergeant First Class Michael Marciello, when Artiga saw the psychiatrist's report, Artiga was, \"livid\". He \"stormed\" back to the psychiatrist and \"browbeat\" her to change her report to read that Ford was mentally unstable, and ordered her to have Ford shipped out of the country. Ford was later strapped to a medical gurney and medvac'd out of Iraq. He was initially sent to Kuwait and eventually to Landstuhl, Germany. Ford then underwent psychological evaluation in Germany and also two bases in the United States for approximately 8 months.\nDavid DeBatto indicated he reviewed hundreds of documents regarding Ford's case and couldn't find any of the required documents that should be filed when a soldier is medvac'd from one area to another. David also stated that every doctor that evaluated Ford found him to be completely normal, with absolutely no psychological or mental health issues.\nDeBatto reported that Ford was not the only soldier to have this happen to him. According to Col. C. Tsai, a military psychiatrist who examined Ford at the Army Regional Medical Center in Landstuhl, Germany, there had been three or four other soldiers who had been sent there under very similar circumstances. Specifically, the soldiers had made allegations of abuse or mistreatment of Iraqi prisoners. DeBatto indicated he had even came across a decorated veteran from the first Gulf War who made allegations and has committed to a mental ward in Kentucky. According to DeBatto, that officer is still fighting his committal. Tsai had found nothing at all unstable about Ford.\nDeBatto reported that Ford was eventually given an honorable discharge in February, 2004. He is currently looking into filing civil and criminal charges against the officers involved. He has contacted the FBI, the Department of the Army's Office of the Inspector General, as well as the Army's Criminal Investigation Division.

The reasons why it ended the campaign was variously reported and speculated in media. The operation, while fairly popular, suffered unexpected troubles and drew criticism from security experts and others from the start. \nThe company started distributing a screensaver on November 29, 2004 on makelovenotspam.com. Once installed, the computer would send HTTP requests to spammers' servers when not in use. The intent was to raise the running costs of those servers. Lycos coordinated these requests by choosing targets from lists generated by organizations such as Spamcop.com. The servers were monitored so as to keep them under heavy load, but alive. \nSecurity experts roundly criticized the program. Steve Linford, director of a non-profit anti-spam organization SpamHaus, and Graham Cluley, a senior technology consultant of Sophos, pointed out that lowering moral standards to fight spammers was not a good idea. The legality of attacking the servers was also debated since it resembles \"Distributed Denial of Service\" attacks (DDoS), except that Lycos did not completely shut down the target servers. \nOther troubles arose. The day after the campaign was launched, there was an alleged takeover of the web site's top page by a cracker. The page was replaced with a warning against the use of the screensaver, according to a screenshot sent via email to the Finnish security firm F-Secure. A Lycos spokesperson said that the screenshot was a hoax: there was no trace of intrusion in the server log and the site was simply unavailable due to a high demand. \nSome Internet service providers blocked either the traffic to Lycos-Europe, or the requests generated by the screensaver. \nNext, one of the targeted sites redirected all traffic to the Lycos' server, making Lycos itself a target. The company had maintained that its server was immune from the attack. Lycos stopped distributing the program on December 3, 2004 and asked clients to \"stay tuned.\" The company later ended the program. \nOn December 6, F-Secure reported a virus email disguised as the anti-spam screensaver. When its attachment (a zip file) is opened, it self-extracts and installs a \"Trojan horse\" --harmful program disguised as legitimate software.

Named the South American Community of Nations, the organization is a step toward greater coordination among South American states.\nTwo existing South American trade blocs, the Andean Community (Comunidad Andina) and the Southern Common Market (Mercado Com\u00fan del Sur, or Mercosur), have been combined and three previously uninvolved states included to create the community. \nThe summit, held between 7-9 December at Cusco and Ayacucho in Peru, was attended by heads of state from Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Guyana, Peru, Suriname, and Venezuela. Foreign ministers attended for Argentina, Ecuador, Paraguay, and Uruguay. The summit was convened principally to sign the two-page Preamble to the Foundation Act of the South American Union on the second day of the summit. Although the Bolivian and Colombian presidents attended the summit, they did not attend the signing ceremony, this instead being done by representatives. Central American states Mexico and Panama attended the ceremony as observers.\nThe locations for the summit were chosen for their historical significance and their association with events that reflect well on South America. Cusco was the ancient capital of the advanced civilization of the Incas. Ayachucho was the site of an 1824 decisive victory against Spanish troops by the South American independence movement headed by Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar. The First and Second South American Summits were held at Bras\u00edlia, Brazil in September 2000 and Guayaquil, Ecuador in July 2002.\nThe community will include every state in South America with the exception of French Guiana, itself a territory of France. Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and Venezuela join SACN from the Andean Community, a trade bloc established in 1969. From the more recent (1991) Mercosur comes Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay. Guyana, Suriname, two small northeastern countries which had previously not participated in a South American trade bloc, will not immediately join the community. Chile will additionally join; it has, however, been cautious.\nSACN is a more ambitious union than the previous Andean Community and Mercosur. It has been established to be more than a trade union. The \"ultimate goal, which can hopefully be reached, in time, is the United States of South America,\" explains Secretary General of the Andean Community Wagner. A common currency, tariff-free common market, and regional parliament are all proposed in the Cusco declaration.\nMany disputes exist between South American nations that may be issues in advancing SACN.\nThe principal force behind SACN has been Brazil. The First South American Summit was held in Brazil through the efforts of Brazilian President Fernando Henrique Cardoso.\nChile has been an associate member of Mercosur since 1996. It was a member of the Andean Community from its inception in 1969, but withdrew six years later when ruled by General Augusto Pinochet. With 70% of its GDP attributed to foreign trade, Chile has traditionally favored relations with the United States or the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum over South American agreements. \nSACN's short-term political and economic effects may be limited. The elimination of all trade tariffs has long been a goal of both the Andean Community and Mercosur, but has had little success.\nHowever, 32 construction projects were approved at the summit. Worth US$4.3bn over five years, the projects focus on improving regional infrastructure. The largest is a US$700m road highway that will link Brazil and Peru across the Andes mountains. \"These are anchor projects that will be carried out over five years,\" said Wagner. \"They were chosen because they do not serve merely as corridors between countries and zones, but also as a means of promoting development in border regions, which have traditionally been the poorest and most marginalised in our countries.\" Wagner identifies 350 potential infrastructure projects of a combined cost of US$200bn.\nDetails of the South American Community of Nations are expected to be planned further at the first First SACN Summit in March or April of 2005 in Brazil. Work on a constitution is expected to begin in 2005. A Second SACN Summit of unspecified date is to be held in Bolivia."}

The Nobel committee cited \"her contribution to sustainable development, democracy and peace\" as the reasons for awarding the prize. It is the first Peace prize awarded to an environmentalist.\nDr Maathai is a member of parliament in Kenya, the country's deputy environmental minister, and holds a in from the University of Nairobi.

Since its founding in 1997, the organization claims to have planted over 30 million trees, in the process employing thousands of women \u2014 offering them empowerment, education and even family planning.\nThe GBM organises rural women in Kenya to participate in environmentally friendly activities such as reforestation; economically-conducive activities like eco-tourism and training in forestry and food processing; as well as community development. \nOn her Green Belt Movement project, Dr Maathai told the Courier in 1999, \"If you want to save the environment, you should protect the people first, because human beings are part of biological diversity. And if we can't protect our own species, what's the point of protecting tree species?\"\nIn accepting the prize, Dr Maathai said that she was humbled by the recognition and uplifted by the honor of receiving the award, and discussed social and environmental problems that still challenge Africa and the rest of the world. The award includes a cash component of 10 million Swedish Kronor (approximately US$1.4 million). \nDr Maathai's project was opposed by the Kenyan government during 's rule, and Dr Maathai's demonstrations to protect the forests often met with violent resistance; eventually, she was jailed. \n\"The government thinks that by threatening me and bashing me they can silence me,\" Dr Maathai said. \"But I have an elephant's skin and somebody must raise their voice.\"\nIn 1997 Dr Maathai ran for president on the Liberal Party of Kenya ticket. In 2002 \u2014 after Moi's party lost the presidential race \u2014 she was elected to Parliament, and was appointed deputy minister of environment for the new government the next year, a position she holds today.

The result means President Chen Shui-bian may have trouble pursuing his agenda of distancing Taiwan from mainland China.\nElection officials say the Kuomintang-led opposition coalition will end up with 114 seats in Taiwan's 225-member Legislative Yuan - one more than it had going into Saturday's vote. The coalition favors stronger ties with mainland and leaving unchanged Taiwan's political status. The pro-independence coalition led by President Chen Shui-bian's Democratic Progressive Party, failed again to secure control of the legislature. It captured 101 seats.\nThe election was seen as a referendum on the president's efforts to distance Taiwan from mainland China and move toward greater separation. Taiwan and mainland China split in 1949 after a civil war divided the country. While the People's Republic of China was established on the mainland, the Nationalists fled to Taiwan and continued to cling onto the Republic of China. While Taipei moved away from its claim of being the sole legitimate government of China in the 1990s, Beijing continues to consider the island its territory and says Taiwanese independence moves would be considered grounds for war.\nPresident Chen may find it difficult to push forward his key platform issues. They include legislative approval of an $18 billion arms purchase from the United States; renaming state enterprises and foreign offices that bear the name \"China\" or \"Chinese\" to bear the name \"Taiwan,\" and a referendum on a new constitution.\nHsiao Bi-Khim, a member of the president's Democratic Progressive's Party, says those issues are important for his country. \"These issues, they're actually reflecting the popular sentiment here and are a pragmatic step forward,\" said Hsiao Bi-Khim. \"It's a process of natural evolution here in Taiwan.\"\nBeijing says the proposals could provoke Chinese intervention but Ms. Hsiao says the president will not push Taiwan toward formal independence. \"President Chen has laid out what we will not touch upon, and mainly issues related to sovereignty, independence and national name change, these issues will not be dealt with in the constitutional reform process,\" she said.\nWashington \"does not support\" independence for Taiwan. Neither does it categorically oppose it. It does oppose any unilateral changes in the present situation. Saturday, it appeared that by leaving control of the legislature in the hands of the president's opposition, Taiwan's voters did just that."}

Sites in France, Netherlands, Finland and Slovenia have been affected. \nOn December 14, FIOD-ECD, the Dutch economic crimes police, raided the premises of the hosting provider Mindlab. Servers hosting sites Releases4u.com and Shareconnector.com were seized by the police. The reported number of systems seized differs, from 4 (tweakers.net) to 11 (the register). The raids were initiated by , a Dutch non-government \"copyright oversight organization\".\nBitTorrent link sites distribute torrents, which are computer files with information about a larger, shared file co-ordinated by small servers known as trackers. Unlike predecessors of P2P applications like Napster, this sharing is not centralised on the servers of link site operators, and no illegal files exist on the servers of link site operators. Although such a system has been previously thought to be a legal loophole for file sharers, the recent spate of raids by copyright enforcement authorities apparently proves otherwise.\nPrior to raids Mindlab clients Releases4u and ShareConnector were the largest link sites for the ed2k network in the Netherlands. Mindlab had previously refused to remove the servers for Releases4u and ShareConnector, arguing that such link sites were legal in the Netherlands. \nThe servers were taken down after a discussion that went nowhere according to Tim Kuik, head of BREIN. \"We simply ran of patience,\" he says.\nAt the same time, FinReactor, one of the largest link sites in Finland was raided by the Finnish \"National Bureau of Investigation\" (Keskusrikospoliisi, KRP) at the request of Finnish copyright organisations.\nOn December 19 two large sites, and TorrentBits.org closed without providing an explanation, although these have apparently been voluntary decisions by the operators of the sites. \nPrior to its closure SuprNova.org, based in Slovenia, was generally considered to be the largest BitTorrent link site on the Internet that hosted links to both authorised (e.g. Linux software) and unauthorised files (e.g. Hollywood films). This closure is surprising as it has been generally thought that its location in Slovenia would make it invulnerable to the actions of American-based copyright enforcement groups. \nAccording to a statement made later on the site by its site's 18 year-old owner, who goes by the nickname Sloncek, and an interview for Slyck, he decided to voluntarily close the links section of the site after the news about arrests of admins of several prominent P2P sites and after receiving legal warnings. \nAlthough the forums and the IRC network will remain online, SuprNova.org claims that it will no longer hold links to BitTorrent files again. \nAt the end of 2004, \"eXeem\", a project to decentralize the BitTorrent link network developed by SuprNova.org, reached a beta stage. \nIn a bid to avoid the pitfall of Napster, most other major filesharing networks are decentralized, including Gnutella, Gnutella 2, KaZaA and eDonkey2000. \nThe goal of Exceem was to eliminate the need for torrent link sites and trackers by allowing every user to easily publish new files on the network without having to post a torrent file on a centralized server and distribute them without dedicated trackers. The closed beta testing with more than 5,000 users was underway by December. The status of eXeem after the closure of SuprNova.org remains unclear.\nTorrentBits.org, another link site was closed at about the same time, the reason of which is still unknown at this time. The site's founder and owner, known by the nickname \"Redbeard\", remains unavailable for comment. \nOther torrent sites that have reportedly closed are Delirium Vault, Youceff Torrents (closed by French police), Phoenix Torrents (closed voluntarily).\nActivities of P2P link sites have not been proved to be illegal and so far no link site was successfully sued by copyright owners. However, police in many countries are often willing to close the sites when they are accused of copyright violations. Confiscating the servers is usually enough to destroy the site, as most of the sites are run by volunteers on a non-profit basis, who are unable and unwilling to fight a prolonged legal battle.\nThe first large link site to be closed, , was taken down by Swiss police on March 10th, 2004.\nRaids have apparently followed a trend of a higher probability of raids when site owners have received donations from file sharers; some believe that this allows authorities to charge operators of such link sites for copyright crime instead of copyright infringement. ShareReactor and ShareConnector were both closed soon after purchasing new server equipment using money donated by their users.\nMany people have suspected that the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA), a trade association representing the interests of major movie studios based in the United States, are linked to police actions, although the extent of their involvement is unknown at this stage. The MPAA has taken credit for the closure of FinReactor, although the KRP has officially denied that MPAA had any contacts with Finnish authorities .\nBitTorrent is a (P2P) file distribution tool written by programmer which was debuted at 2002. BitTorrent allows many people to download one file at fast speeds. It does this by having downloaders swap portions of a file with one another, instead of downloading from a single centralised server or individual. It is particularly suited to quickly distributing new files to a large number of users.\n is a peer-to-peer application developed by MetaMachine, using the . eDonkey network encourages permanent sharing of files, ensuring good long-term availability, but is not as effective as BitTorrent in quickly spreading new releases."}

Erdogan has said that recognition is entirely dempendent upon the Greek-Cypriots accepting a United Nations peace plan to re-unify the island, which previously they rejected.\nThe other main stumbling block is possible restrictions on Turkish citizens travelling to and working in other EU nations.

On that date, Peru became the 40th country to ratify an international treaty to reduce smoking, thus triggering activation of the treaty in 90 days.\nAccording to the World Health Organization's World Health Report 2003, tobacco consumption is the single leading preventable cause of death. It prematurely ends the lives of 5 million people a year, a figure which will double by 2020 if current trends are not reversed. Tobacco is the only legal product that causes the death of one half of its regular users, more than many illegal drugs. This means that of the current 1.3 billion smokers, 650 million people will die prematurely due to tobacco. Another way to look at the effect of smoking is to measure the average reduction in life expectancy among smokers. A study published in the British Medical Journal in June 2004 followed 34,439 male doctors since 1951 and showed that smokers died on average 10 years earlier than non-smokers.\nAlthough the number of smokers has stabilized or fallen in developed areas, it is rising in developing or transitional regions, which contain more of the world's population and already 84% of the world's smokers. To fight this increasing health threat, the World Health Organization Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (WHO FCTC) was unanimously adopted by the 56th World Health Assembly in May 2003 following almost three years of negotiations. The treaty aims to reduce both the demand for and the supply of tobacco by setting standards on tobacco price and tax increases, tobacco advertising and sponsorship, labelling, illicit trade and second-hand smoke.\nStudies show that increasing prices through taxes on tobacco products is the most cost-effective way to reduce smoking. The World Bank estimated that a 10% increase in tobacco prices would, on average, result in a reduction of 4% of the demand in high-income countries and 8% in lower-income countries. Thus the treaty suggests tobacco taxes or price controls, although it neither suggests specific levels nor requires any taxes or price controls.\nThe treaty requires all countries adopting it to ban, to the extent allowed by their constitutions, all tobacco advertising, promotion and sponsorship within five years. Health warnings must occupy at least half of the principal display areas of a pack, but they must not be less than 30%. These health warnings must be changed regularly and may include pictures. Cigarette packages must contain information on ingredients and emissions.\nhttp://www.ideaexplore.net/news/041217/smoking2.jpg\nAn anti-smoking ad (source: CDC Media Campaign Resource Center). View more here.\nThe treaty aims to reduce smuggling by requiring adopting nations to mark all tobacco packages for tracing purposes and to indicate their country of destination, as well as to cooperate with each other in monitoring and controlling the movement of tobacco products and investigating their diversion. The treaty bans tobacco sales to and by minors.\nThe idea for an international instrument for tobacco control was initiated in May 1995 at the 48th World Health Assembly. But it wasn\u2019t until 1999, a year after the then WHO Director-General, Dr Gro Harlem Brundtland, made global tobacco control a priority, that work on the present treaty began. During the year after the FCTC was written, 167 countries signed and 23 countries ratified it, making it one of the most rapidly embraced UN treaties of all time. \"The momentum growing around the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control seems unstoppable. It demonstrates the importance placed by the international community on saving many of the millions of lives now lost to tobacco,\" said Dr Lee Jong-wook, WHO Director-General. \"I look forward to more countries joining the 40 states that are making it possible for this Treaty to become law.\"\nOf the countries ratifying the treaty, the largest are (in order of decreasing population) India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Japan, Mexico, Thailand, France, and Burma. Nations that have signed but not yet ratified include China, USA, Brazil, Nigeria, Philippines, Viet Nam, Germany, and Egypt. The largest non-signers are Indonesia, Russia, Colombia, Tanzania, and Uzbekistan. The Himalayan kingdom of Bhutan went beyond the treaty requirements when on December 17 it became the first country in the world to completely ban the sale of tobacco.\nReferences.\n "}

In young, healthy adults, many infections pass unnoticed. But sometimes the influenza virus evolves into a strain that decimates its victims. The worst known strain swept the world in the Fall of 1918, infecting 500-1000 million and killing 40-100 million, about 2-5% of people.\nThere are several theories about where the pandemic began, but the likeliest origin was in Haskell County, Kansas, in the United States. People in the sparsely populated county, where farmers raised pigs, poultry, cattle, and grain, began suffering from influenza in late January 1918. Unusually for flu, it was young, healthy adults who were hardest hit. Victims fell ill suddenly, many progressing to pneumonia and dying, often within days. Within weeks, however, the epidemic ended. The natural geographic isolation of this community normally might have contained the fatal flu in a sort of unintentional quarantine, but the First World War intervened. Men were uprooted from their home towns and congregated in huge numbers in army camps for training and then shipping out to other camps or to fight in Europe. The destination for men from Haskell County was Camp Funston, part of Fort Riley, Kansas, where the first influenza case was reported in early March. As soldiers moved among camps, the virus spread. Within two months, the epidemic spread to most of the army camps and most of the largest cities in the United States. As American soldiers went to France, so did the virus, spreading first from the port of Brest.\nThe flu then spread worldwide. The pandemic reached its height in the Fall of 1918. Spain was affected early, and because Spain was not fighting in the World War, there was no wartime censorship, and news of the outbreak became widely known, leading to the flu being called the Spanish Flu in many countries. In Spain, however, it was called French Flu or the Naples Soldier. In India, about 12 million people died of flu. In some US cities, people died so quickly that morticians couldn't cope with the bodies. According to Jessie Lee Brown Foveaux, who worked in the Fort Riley laundry during the epidemic: \"They were piling them up in a warehouse until they could get coffins for them.\"\nThe disease started with cough, then headache. Temperature, breathing and heart rate increased rapidly. In the worst cases, pneumonia came next, the lungs filling with liquid, drowning the patients and turning them blue from lack of air. Patients bled from every orifice: mouths, noses, ears, eyes. Those who survived often suffered temporary or permanent brain damage. Several million developed encephalitis lethargica, in which victims were trapped in a permanent sleeplike and rigid state, as portrayed in the 1990 movie \"Awakenings.\" In others, normal thought processes were impaired. During negotiations to end World War I, US President Woodrow Wilson was struck with flu, and people around him noted that his mental abilities never fully recovered. The French leader George Clemenceau had wanted harsher punishment of Germany than Wilson had desired. Clemenceau may have convinced Wilson in his weakened state to accept such harsh terms, which may have been one of the factors causing World War II.\nSince flu is highly contagious early in the illness, even before symptoms appear, strict quarantine may be necessary to stop its spread during an epidemic. Australia kept its 1918 flu death rate relatively low by enforcing quarantines. However, in many parts of the world, public health officials hesitated to impose such measures, giving the disease time to gain a foothold. In the US city of Philadelphia, a rally of half a million people was planned in September 1918 to sell bonds to fund the war, at just the time when the flu started to infect residents. Although doctors warned the public health director to cancel the rally, he wanted to meet the city's quota to raise money for the war and refused to cancel the event. Within days after the rally, half a million city residents caught the flu.\nWhy was the 1918 flu so deadly? The influenza virus wasn't preserved at the time of the outbreak, at least on purpose. But in the late 1990s researchers Ann Reid, Jeffery K. Taubenberger, and their colleagues extracted and sequenced the genetic material of the virus, RNA, from tissue of victims who died in the pandemic. They used bits of lung that were preserved in formalin from victims on army bases or from victims buried in permafrost in the Alaskan village of Brevig Mission, where flu killed 85% of adults. Comparisons with known flu viruses in humans, pigs, and birds suggest that some genes of the 1918 virus came from birds or an unknown animal source. Other scientists then were able to show that the amino acid sequence of hemagglutinin protein from the 1918 virus had several changes from other flu viruses that may have helped it to easily bind and invade human cells, and that made the virus look different enough from earlier flu virus strains that people had no immunity.\nThe possibility exists that another flu pandemic will sweep the world like the one in 1918. In 2004, an H5N1 influenza virus has killed millions of birds and at least 30 people in southeast Asia. So far this virus strain has not evolved the ability to pass directly from human to human, but that possibility becomes more likely as the bird flu pandemic continues and humans remain in contact with chickens, ducks, and other birds. The virus has killed two-thirds of people reported to be infected. Dr. Tim Uyeki, an epidemiologist for the US Centers for Disease Control, says, \"you have the ingredients in Asia right now for a public health disaster.\"\nBut since sequences of this bird flu virus are known, it may be possible to develop a vaccine or set of vaccines to protect against it. At a special meeting of influenza experts on November 11th and 12th, World Health Organization influenza program chief Klaus Stohr said, \"It is not only possible, but also important, that influenza pandemic vaccines be made available... and there's a shared responsibility needed to make that happen\u2026. We have a huge window of opportunity now.\"\nReferences.\n "}

The Council vote generated a lot of controversy. Later, the Dutch parliament failed to convince its EU representatives to reverse their vote. \nAccording to the new voting weights which took effect on November 1, the majority needed to formally adopt the Common Position (after translations were done) is questionable.

The Polish Minister of Science and Information Technology, Wlodzimierz Marcinski, travelled to Brussels to tell the Council.\nThe decision has been welcomed by the opponents of software patents, and condemned by the pro-software-patent lobbies.\nWith a slim majority, the council voted for the \"Common Position\" on the May 18th directive.\nSince then, most of the countries have received considerable pressure from their citizens and parliaments to reverse the vote.

David DeBatto, who wrote the original article about Frank Ford states that every doctor that evaluated Ford found him to be completely normal, with absolutely no psychological or mental health issues. However according to VeriSEAL, which claims to provide independent and no-cost verification of Special Operations Forces personnel backgrounds, the cover-up accusations are being made by a fake SEAL member.\nFord has already made several unsubstantiated claims including being a member of President Nixon's security detail, a medical doctor, a nobleman with a castle in Europe, a Navy SEAL and knowing the exact location of Saddam Hussein and Ali Hassan al-Majid known as \"Chemical Ali\".

This is beyond question as far as I am concerned. However, although that trait may make him unpopular with some, it does not make him a liar. Some people seem to have a hard time separating the two.\"\nAccording to Ford he attended a discontinued BUD/S program for Navy corpsmen during 1980's as a doctor assigned to a Navy SEAL team. However Navy records do not list Ford among the program graduates. About this DeBatto said: \"he called himself \"Doc\" when I met him too at Fort Bragg in February 2003. However, I asked him right away if he was an MD or PhD. and he told me no, he was just a medic, but he has always been referred to as \"Doc\" since becoming a Navy medic over 30 years ago. It just kind of stuck he said. He also said he was in some kind of medical school or internship, which, upon later research, turned out to be true. It ain't Harvard, but it is a legitimate medical school\". Actually Frank Ford is a \"Doctor of Naturopathy\" by the Clayton School of Natural Healing in Alabama.\nAccording to Col. C. Tsai, a military psychiatrist who examined Ford at the Army Regional Medical Center in Landstuhl, Germany, Tsai had found nothing at all unstable about Ford.\" Tsai was also interviewed by Speigel Television in Germany on this issue. According to Capitain Vic Artiga, Ford's company commander, who Ford implicates, he was evacuated for \"combat stress\" behavioal problems.\nIn a interview to Los Angeles Times reporter, Lt. Col. Timothy J. Ryan, Ford's commander, said: \"all allegations of prisoner abuse in Samarra were investigated immediately and no wrongdoing was ever found\". Lt. Col. Timothy J. Ryan is also implicated by Ford's testimony.\nFord said that Artiga accused him of being \"delusional\" and gave him \"30 seconds to retract or face psychiatric referral\". Artiga, who is a police officer in Redwood City as civilian, denied Ford claims:\"That's just laughable. In my years as a policeman, I've done hundreds of investigations. I can tell yoou that the investigation we did was as thorough as they come\".\nAccording to Sergeant First Class Michael Marciello, an alleged witness, when Captain Vic Artiga saw an initial psychiatrist's report, Artiga was, \"livid\". He \"stormed\" back to the psychiatrist and \"browbeat\" her to change her report to read that Ford was mentally unstable, and ordered her to have Ford shipped out of the country. Ford was later strapped to a medical gurney and medvac'd out of Iraq. He was initially sent to Kuwait and eventually to Landstuhl, Germany. Ford then underwent psychological evaluation in Germany and also two bases in the United States for approximately 8 months.\nThe Ford accusation was reported by David DeBatto and the article can be seen at Salon News. The case is under investigation."}

More than 140,000 deaths were caused by resulting tsunami, which in Thailand were up to 10 meters (33 feet) tall, and struck within three hours of the initial event.\nMultiple tsunamis struck and ravaged coastal regions all over the Indian Ocean, devastating regions including the Indonesian province of Aceh, the coast of Sri Lanka, coastal areas of the Indian state of Tamil Nadu, the resort island of Phuket, Thailand, and even as far away as Somalia, 4,100\u00a0km (2,500\u00a0mi) west of the epicenter.\n\"While the earthquake and the tsunamis are no longer ongoing (other than aftershocks), the humanitarian and economic crisis generated by the disaster is still ongoing. This report will attempt to cover the crisis as it continues to develop.\"\nDamage and casualties.\nThe great earthquake triggered massive tsunamis (popularly known as \"tidal waves\"), which struck the coasts of the Indian Ocean. However Pacific Ocean coasts were not affected.\nThe Aceh province of Indonesia is the most affected. Officials in Sri Lanka estimate the death toll to be over 40,000. Much of the capital Colombo is flooded and high number of casualties are feared in the North East of the country around the town of Trincomalee. The New York Times estimated that at least 2 hours passed from the time of the earthquake before the island was affected. The tragedy has caused at least some Sri Lankans to ask what precautions could have allowed more people to avoid harm.\nIn India, the islands of Andaman and Nicobar and the southern states of Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh are the most affected. The police have said that there are 100 dead in Chennai city alone. Mild tremors were experienced in Chennai, Bangalore and Cochin cities. The Prime Minister of India, Dr. Manmohan Singh has expressed concern over the disaster and said that all directions were given to the different agencies including the Navy for quick relief work. The meteorological department has warned people in coastal areas in southern India to stay away as there are possibilities of more waves due to after-shocks for the next 3 to 4 days.\nIn addition to the large number of local residents, numerous tourists vacationing during the busy Christmas holiday travel season were among the victims. In a press conference on December 31, Swedish prime minister G\u00f6ran Persson reported that the number of Swedes that are confirmed dead is 59 and the number of missing Swedes is 3 559. Most of these were on vacation in Thailand, primarily in Khao Lak and Phi Phi Island.\nAs of December 31, 2004, the death toll is estimated by the United Nations to be up to 150,000. However, water-borne diseases are expected to kill nearly twice as many people.\nQuake characteristics.\nThe quake was initially reported at magnitude 6.8 but soon upgraded to 8.5, and then 8.9 and finally 9.0. The largest recorded earthquake was the Great Chilean Earthquake of 1960, at magnitude 9.5.\nThe hypocenter was measured at 3.298\u00b0N, 95.779\u00b0E, some 160 kilometres west of Sumatra, at a depth of 10 km underwater, within the \"Ring of Fire\" zone of frequent earthquakes.\nThe quake was felt as far away as Bangladesh, India, Myanmar, Malaysia, Maledives Singapore and Thailand.\nThe earthquake was unusually large in geographical extent. 1,125\u00a0km (700\u00a0mi) of faultline slipped 15\u00a0m (50\u00a0ft) along the subduction zone where the India Plate dives under the Burma Plate. This formed a shock wave in the Indian Ocean, creating tsunamis that traveled at up to 800\u00a0km/h (500\u00a0mi/h). \nNumerous aftershocks of between magnitude 5.7 and 6.1 were reported off the Andaman Islands in the following hours. Aftershocks off the Nicobar Islands were also reported, including ones of magnitude 7.3 , and 6.5 . (See USGS current earthquake information.)\nBased on one seismic model, some of the smaller islands southwest of Sumatra have moved southwest up to 20 m (66 ft). The northern tip of Sumatra, which is on the Burma Plate as opposed to the southern regions on the Sunda Plate, may also have moved southwest up to 36 m (120 ft). Other models suggest that most of the movement would have been vertical rather than lateral. Further measurement is needed to determine the nature of the actual movement. The massive release of energy and shift in mass also caused the earth to wobble slightly on its axis.\nOne year ago to this day, over 30,000 Iranians were killed by an earthquake with a 6.6 magnitude. The Indian Ocean Earthquake came just three days after a magnitude 8.1 earthquake in a completely uninhabited region off Macquarie Island near Antarctica.\nEarthquakes above magnitude 9 occur, on average, only about once every twenty years.\nPost-tsunami humanitarian situation.\nLarge amounts of humanitarian aid are needed due to widespread damage to infrastructure, food and water shortages and economic damage to the fishing and tourism industries. Epidemics are of special concern, as they are highly likely due to the high population density and tropical climate of the affected areas. The United Nations has stated that the largest relief operation in history is underway.\nThe overwhelming concern of humanitarian and government agencies is to quickly identify and bury the dead before they become a health issue and contribute to the spread of diseases such as cholera, diphtheria, dysentery and typhoid (according to widespread but misguided belief The Times). Other high priorities are delivery of medical supplies and personnel to overwhelmed hospitals and clinics, tent shelters and clothing to people who have lost their houses and belongings, and potable water. Many usual sources of water were spoiled either by salt water, broken by the force of the tsunami, or contaminated with bodies of dead people or livestock, requiring water purification equipment or trucking potable water into the affected region.\nHumanitarian assistance.\nGovernments and humanitarian organisations around the world are scrambling to offer aid and technical help after the quake and tsunamis that killed thousands of people in southern Asia and northwest Africa and caused wide-spread devastation. The World Bank estimates the amount of aid needed at USD 5 billion. \nNumerous organizations are also asking businesses and individuals to contribute towards relief efforts:\nWARNING: Due the nature of Wikinews, it cannot guarantee the veracity of outside links and scams involving charities are a danger. Beware of organizations that have names similar to that of well-known aid agencies.\nThe following countries and organization are contributing towards the relief efforts (listed alphabetically):"}

Meanwhile, the Iranian men are understood to be receiving medical treatment, some having broken their fast after more than two weeks of starvation.\nTwo Melburnians, Juliana Qian and Emily Smith, held a 24-hour fast, including a 12-hour public vigil at the city's central Flinders Street Station on Christmas Day. Seventeen-year-old Ms Qian said, \"I want to show my support to the detainees, and to draw attention to their situation. Many Iranians have been detained in Australia for four or five years. There is much evidence to suggest these detainees would be persecuted if deported to Iran.\"\nSenator Andrew Bartlett, of the Australian Democrats Party, fasted for five days earlier in the week, hoping to draw attention to the plight of asylum seekers in the nation's controversial immigration system, which is highly intolerant of what it calls \"unauthorised\" arrivals. Artist and convenor of Spare Rooms for Refugees, Kate Durham, comedian Corrine Grant, actor and vice-president of Actors for Refugees, Diana Greentree, writer Arnold Zable, and musician Kavisha Mazzella have also fasted. Other Australians continue fasting in a rolling programme of three days each, with the last of these planned to end on New Year's Eve with a vigil outside St Stephen's Cathedral in Brisbane.\nMost of the hunger striking detainees have been in high security detention for over four years, with no assigned date for release or repatriation. As many as 27 were starving themselves during this particular episode, and some had sewed their lips. Three others had staged a rooftop protest.\nA letter from the hunger striking detainees explains their reasons for fasting, and for some having broken fast. \"We ... listened to their plea for us to end the hunger strike and have therefore decided to start eating again on Christmas Day as a sign of our good will and friendship.\n\"It saddens us that you have chosen to ignore until now all the information about us Arab-Iranians which we and our friends have provided to you, your Minister and her Department. We have demonstrated that our Arab minority suffers disadvantages and persecution in Iran and that, no matter what our individual situation, we all had to flee home because we were striving for more freedom and justice for our people. We are real and genuine refugees.\n\"It is unconscionable that we are not allowed to submit this information or that DIMIA and the Australian courts should not be permitted to consider it, contrary to other civilized countries. How can we prove our case when the authorities will not acknowledge the independent information we have provided?\"\nAustralia's Department of Immigration Multiculturalism and Indigenous Affairs is notorious for ignoring information provided in support of detainees, while upholding that similarly sourced information proves the detainees claims of asylum are ungrounded. One such case is the Bakhtyari family, being deported over Christmas. Verified documents indicating an Afghan origin for the family are disputed by the Department, while apparently forged documents are held by the department as sufficient to show that the family are natives of Pakistan, hence their current, and ongoing 'repatriation' to that country.\nThe Department has for a number of years ignored recommendations by the Australian Government's own Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission to improve processing conditions for asylum seekers, particularly with respect to the issue of children in detention. Independent organisations such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch also have repeatedly condemned the Australian system.\nPoliticians in the Australian Federal Government express confidence in this system, such as Alexander Downer, Foreign Minister, on the Bakhtiyaris: \"If you're found not to be a refugee and you've been falsely claiming to be a refugee you should go back home and they should go back to Pakistan where they came from.\""}

This policy is controversial due to areas of poverty within the country, and the smuggling of genetically modified grains into the country earlier this month.\nThe Zambian government has previously been criticised by some for its annual ban on fishing during December.

Ohio Republican Secretary of State J. Kenneth Blackwell, President George W. Bush, Vice-President Dick Cheney and White House Political Advisor Karl Rove were subpoenaed for depositions December 28th and 29th in a challenge supported by the Reverend Jesse Jackson. Blackwell has refused to appear, claiming in a court filing that he is not required to be interviewed since he is a high-ranking public official. The lawyer for the other three officials claims that his clients were not properly served the subpoenas. \nThe deposition was part of a lawsuit filed at the Ohio Supreme Court challenging the results of the U.S. presidential election in that state. A multi-party recount effort completed on December 28 showed a 300 vote difference between the initial and final tallies, but failed to answer questions about irregularities in the voting process such as shortages of voting machines in minority precincts, problems with electronic voting machines, and statistical improbabilities in reported vote tallies.\nIn his court filing, Blackwell further called those asking questions about the vote engaging in 'frivolous conduct' and making too many requests of election officials around the state. Republican Blackwell, as Secretary of State, assigns all members, directors and deputy directors of the precinct boards of elections that run the elections in the state. Challengers to the voting process have questioned whether these boards were adequately run as bipartisan operations, suggesting that since the boards owe Blackwell their jobs, this could have established a pattern of problems that favored Bush at Kerry's expense."}

Its risk was first calculated as 2 out of 10 on the Torino scale. \nThis rank was upgraded to Level 4 Dec. 24, giving it the highest score ever for a near-Earth asteroid. It was considered to have a 1 in 37 chance of striking the Earth. \nUpon discovery of previously recorded sightings of the same asteroid, its estimated flight path was corrected and found to miss the Earth entirely, outside of the margin of error.

Currently, the House expects a high level of ethical conduct, beyond the minimum required by law. The proposal, backed by House Speaker Dennis Hastert (R-IL), would reduce the expectation to only require the lowest level of conduct. With the new rules, representatives would only be admonished if they actually violate the law.\nThe current rules were used for the admonishment of Majority Leader Tom DeLay (R-TX). The committee found issue with the appearance that he had provided legislative favors with the Federal Aviation Administration for political donors in a Texas political dispute, and with improperly offering support for another Republican representative's son in exchange for the lawmaker's vote in a Medicare issue.\nDemocrats and watchdog groups point out that the loss of ethical rules would be a serious blow to the government. Fred Wertheimer, president of Democracy 21, added, \"If House Republican leaders are allowed to prevail, they will have gutted the single most important ethics standard in the House and turned House Majority Leader Tom DeLay's multiple ethics transgressions into acceptable conduct for all House members.\"\nThe GOP has previously attempted to legislate rules to protect DeLay. In November 2004 the House Republicans proposed a rule change that would allow members indicted by state grand juries to retain their leadership posts, in reaction to a concern that DeLay would be indicted by a Texas grand jury. The jury had indicted three of DeLay's political associates. A number of House Republicans benefitted from an aggressive redistricting in Texas led by DeLay that led to the defeat of 5 democrat incumbents. The indictment rule had been adopted by the House Republicans in 1993 when they were trying to end four decades of Democrat control of the House."}

Egeland later recanted his statement, adding that America's contributions to Asia's tsunami relief was \"one of the most generous pledges so far.\"\nThe Bush administration has pledged $350 million in aid for the relief effort. Critics have been quick to compare this to the $177 million spent every day in Iraq to conduct war in that country. In comparison, there was a $500 million pledge made recently by the government of Japan.\nIndependently of the government, individual Americans have been directly contributing money to aid organizations. Amazon.com placed a link for the American Red Cross, collecting more than $8 million from 100,000 people as of Friday, December 31st. 12,000 donors have donated over $1.2 million to the Red Cross through Yahoo.com.\nScores of International aid organizations are accepting donations for helping victims of the earthquake and tsunami.

The channel's remaining 8 million subscribers may not give it enough audience to ensure its survival, according to some experts.\nThe network received critical acclaim for a quirky lineup that includes the series, \"Brilliant But Cancelled,\" which took American broadcast networks, including parent NBC, to task for cancelling quality programs.\nCanadian roots.\nTrio originally got its start in the 1980s as a Canadian cable channel owned by the CBC. Its original slate was described as \"a general entertainment channel that features the most successful contemporary dramas, documentaries and films from Canada, the UK and Australia. For the last six years, TRIO has been the largest exporter of Canadian TV programs to the US with over 3,000 hours of content,\" according to CBC press releases.\nThe channel's Canadian roots were cut in 2000 when media mogul Barry Diller snapped up Trio and sister channel News World International from the CBC and partner Power Corp. for $155 million in cash. Diller saw the channel as a cheap consolation prize after he was outbid by NBC for the Bravo cable network earlier that year. Within months, Diller rebranded Trio, dumped the Canadian dramas and geared it more toward edgier pop culture programming.\nCorporate shuffle.\nOver the next couple of years, Trio changed hands twice. First to Vivendi Universal, then to NBC in a package deal that landed the American TV network a movie studio and the USA and SCI FI cable networks. Trio was seen as more of an afterthought at the time.\nIn a hint of what may be the fate of the channel, NBC Universal moved most of Trio's executive and programming staff over to Bravo, a now-sibling network, which is seen in 80 million U.S. homes. Some experts predict that Trio will eventually be folded with its more successful programming ported over to Bravo.\n\"Trio was a refreshing oasis on the dial, with a quirky pop-culture attitude that showed in its programming. Trio leaving is kind of like having a witty friend move out of town,\" Gael Fashingbauer Cooper, MSNBC television critic said in her weekly column. \"It'll be missed.\"\nNBC Universal has not commented publicly on the long-term future or specific plans for Trio channel besides to say it was committed to programming the network for current subscribers as the conglomerate re-evaluates its digital cable strategy."}

Orbach was a staple of American cinema, stage and television, with his most recent role being in the NBC police drama \"Law and Order.\" \nOrbach is survived by his wife of 25 years, Elaine Cancilla, and his two sons Anthony and Christopher. \nBiography.\nOrbach was born in the tough Bronx borough of New York City in 1935 to a family of entertainers. His father Leon Orbach was an vaudeville actor and his mother Emily Orbach was a radio singer and greeting card writer. \nThe family moved often to keep up with travelling Vaudeville acts, but eventually settled in Waukegan Illinois where Orbach played football at the local high school. After graduation, Orbach got a summer job at the Chevy Chase Country Club in Wheeling doing odd jobs ranging from stagecraft to small acting parts in plays. \nHe then studied drama at the University of Illinois before transferring to Northwestern where he studied the Stanislavsky Method of drama acting. In 1955, Orbach dropped out of college and moved to New York City where he got a job as an understudy in The Threepenny Opera. \nOrbach continued to work in theater, eventually earning roles in broadway musicals, but by 1961 had grown dissatisfied with being typecast as a musical actor. He tried briefly to break into film without success, and eventually returned to broadway where he earned numerous accolades for his roles in such musicals as \"Guys and Dolls\" and \"Chicago\". \nOrbach finally broke into television in the 1980s as a recurring character in shows such as the mystery-drama \"Murder She Wrote\" and the hit sitcom \"Golden Girls\". \nHe earned the lead role as the title character in his own short-lived series \"The Law and Harry McGraw\", a spinoff of \"Murder She Wrote\". Orbach also scored key roles in a few Hollywood films, including the action thriller \"F/X\", and the dance-musical hit \"Dirty Dancing\", but continued to find his mainstay in television crime dramas. \nIn 1990, he picked up a role in the new NBC crime drama \"Law and Order\" as the acerbic-witted Lennie Briscoe, a role which soon become a regular job. Orbach continued in this role in addition to movie roles and occasional musical appearances until his death this last week. \nBattle with Cancer.\nOrbach was diagnosed with Prostate cancer in Spring of 2004, a fact he kept private until November when he checked into New York's Memorial Sloan-Ketting Cancer Center for treatment. In spite of the aggressive nature of the treatment, he died on the evening of December 28."}

It is the most recent in a string of websites formed by his followers, including ones against Canada, United States, and their original website, godhatesfags.com, campaigning against homosexuals.\nThe anti-Swede website \u2014 godhatessweden.com \u2014 proclaims \"thank God for 5,000 dead Swedes\" and indicates that the church members \"pray for all 20,000 Swedes missing in the Tsunami's wake to be declared dead.\" The website also links to a recording of a recent sermon by Reverend Phelps and a flyer containing the church's official position. The flyer is a caricature of a devil with small signs declaring that Sweden is a \"Homo-fascist state\" and a \"damned land of ... Sodomites\".\nThe WBC's outcries against Sweden seem to stem from the arrest of Pastor Ake Green by Swedish authorities for describing homosexuals as \"a horrible cancerous tumour in the body of society\". \nThe Westboro Baptist Church, founded in 1955 by Fred Phelps, is known for its continuous series of protests and for picketing the funerals of homosexuals, w:AIDS victims, and gay rights activists. Other than the Asian Tsunami disaster, the group has, in the past, declared the September 11th attacks on the United States and the Columbia Space Shuttle disaster are messages from God warning of His wrath to come against homosexuals, whom he refers to as 'fags' on account of the fact that, like a faggot of wood, they \"fuel God's wrath\".\nIn the FAQ of their main website, GodHatesFags.com, Rev. Phelps expresses his followers' opinions of the Tsunami disaster:\n\"The tsunami was an adumbration of the wrath of God, a harbinger of things to come: that Great Day of Judgment... those Asian countries weren\u2019t the only ones affected by the tsunami. Do you realize that among the dead and missing are 3,500 Swedes and over 3,000 Americans? Sweden, who recently jailed a Gospel preacher for a month because he preached Bible verses and sentiments about the abomination that is the homosexual lifestyle from his own pulpit to his own congregation. America, who is awash in diseased fag feces &amp; semen, and is an apostate land of the sodomite damned. And you wonder if this is the wrath of God?\""}

The full impact of the change will be felt in the middle of the century.\nThe Bush Administration proposal, which will be offered to Congress in February or March 2005, is part of an overall Social Security reform package that also would create \u201cpersonal investment accounts\u201d into which individual taxpayers could divert part of their payroll taxes. The White House believes that the shortfall in benefits created by the adoption of price indexing would be made up by capital gains from the stocks and bonds held by individual taxpayers in their personal investment accounts. \nThe move is akin to the private sector's migration from defined benefit retirement plans to defined contribution benefit plans such as 401(k)s as almost half of a worker\u2019s benefits will not be guaranteed by the year 2075. President Bush will support the move to price indexing for calculating initial benefits by pointing out that it was the approach recommended by his 2001 Commission to Strengthen Social Security.\nBenefits currently are calculated by averaging a worker\u2019s earnings in their 35 highest-paid years and adjusting earnings to factor in cost of living standards at the worker\u2019s retirement age. Under the Bush proposal, rather than adjusting benefits on the basis of earnings growth, the calculation would be based on the increase in the consumer price index over those years.\nThe implementation of \"price indexing\" would cut future Social Security costs by trillions of dollars. However, the cuts in guaranteed benefits for middle-class and some high-income workers would be substantial: 9.9% for workers retiring in 2022, over 25% for workers retiring in 2042, and 46% for workers retiring in 2075.\nOpponents of the price-indexing proposal point out that inflation-based calculations of benefits, by linking benefits to prices but not wage levels, would cut retirees out from future increases in living standards since it is wages and not prices that determine standards of living. While American Association of Retired Persons (AARP) Policy Director John Rother concedes that many of the arguments of opponents are valid, price indexing is inevitable and must be viewed in the context of President Bush\u2019s total reform package. \nRother points out that Social Security benefits, which currently equal 42 percent of the earnings of an average worker retiring at age 65, would be reduced to 20% of pre-retirement earnings for future retirees, thus potentially freezing retirees into today\u2019s standard of living. However, Rother says that price indexing has to be linked to Bush\u2019s private investment accounts as income from the accounts give retirees the chance to make up the shortfalls."}

These observations were noted by former Indonesian central parliament member Firman Jaya Daeli, activists from Howu-howu (a Dutch NGO), and Surf Aid International.\nMost international aid in Indonesia has been focused on the province of Naggroe Aceh Darussalam (Aceh), as it is where the biggest number of dead has been reported.\nThere has also been other reports from local media that the island of Simeulue is suffering similar fate.\nAlthough the number of dead in these two islands is relatively small compared to other areas, the number of people left homeless is far from insignificant. In Simeulue of the 15 000 households 7 500 have permanently lost their homes. The number of destroyed houses in Nias is estimated at 4 500. Infrastructure damage, leading to slow distribution of food aid, has lead to the very real possibility of widespread starvation.\nEarly reports of the situation in Nais suggested the islands were \"submerged\" and \"obliterated\" , however these stories were later suggested to have been greatly exaggerated , fortunately most of the islands estimated 600,000 inhabitants were spared loss of life. The estimated death toll is over 100. Eleven members of a Taiwanese medical team arrived on Nias on December 31 most of whom relocated to Aceh due to more pressing need.\nThe island is popular with surfers who have mounted a considerable grassroots campaign to provide aid to the island (see links below).\nCommunication to and from the isolated island proves to be difficult."}

In early July the probe, named Deep Impact, will approach Comet Tempel 1 to take a number of measurements and photographs. The probe will then split in two, with one part \u2014 containing an 820-pound copper weight \u2014 propelling itself towards the path of the comet. Twenty-four hours after separation the comet will crash into the slower-moving impactor, creating a crater 100 meters wide.\nAstronomers know little of the nuclei of comets, and this mission was designed to determine the make-up of comets' cores. The event will be watched by many instruments: there are two cameras on the part of the probe that is not getting destroyed, a camera on the impactor will broadcast almost until the crash, and telescopes around Earth will also be aimed at the point of the impact. Scientists hope that by studying the depth of the crater and the material ejected from the comet in the crash they will get a better idea of the core's composition.\nThe probe is named Deep Impact after a Hollywood movie of the same title. In the movie a comet is bombarded with warheads in order to steer it off a collision course with Earth. Unlike the movie, however, the goal of this mission is not to destroy the comet. Indeed, probe's size makes it very unlikely that the comet will suffer more than a crater: the comet is 3.7 miles wide while the probe is about the size of a washing machine.\nThe probe will be launched aboard a Delta II rocket from Cape Canaveral in Florida."}

The wire services such as Reuters immediately wrote articles about the rumour. Barclays refused to comment on market speculation (it is standard for all corporations to consistently refuse to comment on all merger speculation). \nNo reporters have so far been able to reach Wells Fargo for comment. It is claimed that talks have been ongoing since October, although they are said to have stalled and then resumed.\nThere is however the possibility that Wells Fargo and Barclays could be contemplating a business line sale, instead of a full on merger. One possibility is Barclays selling its \"Barclays Global Investor\" division back to Wells Fargo. \nWells Fargo (under old management prior to the 1998 merger of Wells Fargo and Norwest Bank) previously sold its Asset Management (mutual fund) business to Barclays in 1995. Renamed Barclays Global Investors, this business remains headquartered in San Francisco, and still has some connections to Wells Fargo's new mutual fund business. \nWells Fargo has a long term goal of deriving around 25% of its revenue from investments and insurance; currently it derives around 15 percent of its revenue from this. The purchase of Barclays Global Investor would significantly move Wells Fargo toward achieving this goal.\nAnother possibility is Barclays buying the private label (or store branded) credit cards of Wells Fargo Financial. In November, Barclays acquired Juniper, a fast growing player in the US private label credit card business. "}

The Venezuelan government said Granda was arrested inside Venezuela's borders, so the arrest was illegal and Granda was actually kidnapped. The Colombian government said that Venezuelans detained Granda inside Venezuela borders because of a reward offered for his capture by the Colombian government. They said he was moved to the region near the border of Venezuela, but inside Colombian territory, where officers finally arrested him. \nThe FARC is considered a terrorist group by the government of Colombia and by the United States , a Colombian ally in the fight against FARC.\nThe FARC is a Marxist revolutionary group with about 12,000 members. The group originated from the Colombian Communist Party of the 1960s. The FARC's main stated objective is the creation of a Communist government in Colombia. Colombian authorities routinely search their members.\nDuring the Cold War, the movement received some help from the former Soviet Union. In recent years, the majority of its funding has come from kidnapping, extortion, hijacking, and illegal trade in cocaine. The FARC attacks Colombian political and military installations and what the group considers to be strategic targets.\nThe National Memorial Institute for the Prevention of Terrorism, or MIPT, an organization based in Oklahoma, US, has associated FARC with 446 incidents resulting in 955 injuries and 429 fatalities since 1968. On September 19, 2004, the FARC killed Luis Eduardo Duque Varon, Antonio Jose Duque Varon, and Alfonso Lopez Nivia, a move supposedly motivated by the victims' involvement with the Self-Defense Forces of Colombia (AUC).\nThere are evidences that the FARC has liaisons with Latin-American criminals, as for example the Brazilian drug-dealer Fernandinho Beira-Mar arrested by Colombian army in Colombia near the border of Venezuela, Brazil and Colombia. Beira-Mar confessed his liaisons with the guerrilla to authorities. According to the COBRA (alias for Colombia-Brazil) operation report of Brazilian police the FARC maintains drug factories in the Amazon, near the board of Colombia. The manufactered drugs would be dispatched to Colombia, United States and Brazil. \nThe FARC has advocates among some people and organizations in Latin America. Some of the group's principal sympathizers are located in Venezuela and Brazil. According to them the FARC is victim of a calumny campaign organized by their enemies, mainly the US.\nFARC Commander Manuel Marulanda V\u00e9lez and others are part of the Marxist and revolutionary magazine America Libre. The Brazilian Carlos Alberto Lib\u00e2nio Christo, known as Frei Betto, a celebrity in Brazil PT and a personal friend of Lula, was former director of the magazine. Raul Reyes, a FARC commander, described the liaisons with President Lula in an interview to Folha de S\u00e3o Paulo newspaper in August 24 2003 and said he met Lula for the first time in San Salvador during the Foro de S\u00e3o Paulo. Olivio Dutra, Minister of Cities of Lula, received FARC leaders in 2001 when he was the Rio Grande do Sul governor. In March 20, 2002, in Ribeir\u00e3o Preto was open a pro-FARC comitee by the Sports Secretary Leopoldo Paulino (PSB) in the government of the mayor Ant\u00f4nio Palocci Filho (PT). Presently Palocci is the Economy Minister of Lula government. Also the FARC is a member of the Foro de S\u00e3o Paulo since 1990, organization guided by PT and Lula. Brazilian president Luis Inacio Lula da Silva don't recognize the FARC as a terrorist movement and say they don't have any illegal relationship with the organization. \nVenezuelan President Hugo Chavez already admitted he encontered FARC leaders between 1998-2002. According to him the meetings were a request of Colombian President Andr\u00e9s Pastrana who wanted to negotiate with the rebels.\nVenezuelan president has been repeatedly accused covering FARC. The Colombian Senator Enrique G\u00f3mez, member of the outer subjects commission of the Congress said in a interview to the Colombian Caracol Radio: \"a conspiracy between the FARC and President Ch\u00e1vez has always existed\" (audio). Colombian Senador Jimmy Chamorro has the same opinion:\"there is no doubt about the narrow relation of Ch\u00e1vez and the FARC, and thus it is demonstrated with the case of the guerrilla Rodrigo Granda\" (audio).\nThe US newspaper Washington Post also accused Chavez of giving protection and suport to the FARC rebels.\nThe Venezuelan union leader of CTV (Confederaci\u00f3n de Trabajadores de Venezuela - Confederations of Workers of Venezuela) who lives in Costa Rica(he requested political asylum) Carlos Ortega said about Chavez in 2004:\"In Venezuela Chavez doesn't rule, who rules is Fidel Castro, the narc-guerilla mainly the FARC; in Venezuela who governs is the international terrorism.\" \nThe Venezuelan deputy for the opposition Julio Montoya said that more than 500 members of FARC have become Venezuelan citizens irregularly and that they have Venezuelan identities. Chavez denies the allegations about his government covering the FARC guerrilla.\nSince the arrest of Granda, Chavez is protesting and accusing Colombian authorities of entering illegally in Venezuela and kidnap. Chavez said in a interview to the journalist Eleazar Diaz Rangel (newspaper \"\u00daltimas Noticias\") that he has proofs that Rodrigo Granda, FARC counselor, was captured illegally in Caracas and moved to C\u00facuta, where the Colombian authorities said the arrestment was done (audio). \nAccording to him the Colombian authorities are lying when they said they arrested Granda inside Colombia (audio). The Vice-President of Venezuela protested against the Granda arrestment and said that if Colombia authorities wanted Granda, they should have requested his extradition by legall ways (audio). \nAccording to the Colombian Minister of Defense, Jorge Alberto Uribe, the Colombian government paid a reward for the capture of Roberto Granda. Venezuelans detained Granda inside Venezuela borders because of a reward offered for his capture and they moved Granda to the region near the border of Venezuela, inside Colombian territory, where Colombian officers finally arrested him. Venezuelan deputy Luis Tasc\u00f3n said that the reward was of US $1.5 million. The Colombian government did not reveal the amount of the reward. \nBecause of the Granda case the President Hugo Chavez said that the Venezuelan ambassador should leave Bogot\u00e1 in Colombia and that the trade agreements between Venezuela and Colombia should be paralised. Chavez demmands that the Colombian President Alvaro Uribe do a public international retraction excusing for the invasion of the Venezuelan territory and the kidnapping of Granda.\nUribe proposed the creation of a special comissition, so the severe crisis can be resolved. He emphasize Colombia did not invaded the Venezuelan territory. The US governemnt supports Colombia in this crisis and demmands Chavez to give a clear declaration about his position related to the FARC. "}

The project would cost about US$242 billion and take about 25 years to complete, according to CNN News. A certain portion of the plans, however, drew scoffs from both the Taiwanese government and the international press\u2014plans including the construction of a freeway to the island of Taiwan, over 100 miles away from the Chinese mainland. \nThe freeway would have to overcome great odds. The length of the freeway, whether a bridge or a tunnel, would have to be much longer than any other in existence. The longest bridge in the world is the Lake Pontchartrain Causeway in Louisiana, USA, which is 23 miles long. Interestingly enough, the second longest bridge will be the Hangzhou Bay Bridge in China; it will span 22.3 miles when completed in 2008. The longest tunnel in the world is the Seikan Tunnel, connecting the Japanese islands of Honshu and Hokkaido at 33.4 miles.\nBesides distance, the bridge would also have to withstand the frequent typhoons and earthquakes that plague the Taiwan Strait. And, according to the Central News Agency (CNA), Taiwan's government funded news service, building a freeway across the strait would cause problems with the area's \"Black Tides\" and \"marine trench\". \nThe biggest obstacles to building the bridge, however, may not be with nature, but rather with politics. The Beijing and Taipei governments do not maintain any official ties. Beijing claims Taiwan as part of its territory and breaks off political ties with any country that maintains political ties with Taipei. The PRC has even threatened to attack Taiwan if the island declares formal independence.\nCurrently it is not possible to travel directly from Taiwan to mainland China or vice versa; Taiwanese flights to and from mainland China are detoured through a third-party airport, usually Hong Kong, before continuing on. In spite of this, the announcement came at a time when representatives from Taiwan and mainland China are discussing possible direct flights\u2014at least for the Chinese New Year.\nTaiwanese leaders dismissed the announcement as propaganda. It was undoubtably seen by a few Taiwanese as an attempt on the People's Republic of China's part to annex the island."}

China has also increased its marine surveillance of the area in recent months.\nThe release of such detailed plans by the Japan Defense Agency sends a strong message to China\u2014that Japan plans to protect its claimed administrative rights over the area at all costs. Many Japanese believe \"that their government should take an even tougher stance toward China\", according to Ho Szu-shen, an associate professor in the Department of Japanese at Fu-jen Catholic University. \nThe Chinese government has not yet commented publicly about the release of the Japanese defense plans for the islands. However, in December, the state-run People's Daily newspaper editorialized that Japan's multi-year Defense Forces Reorganization Plan attempts to \"play up Chinese military threats.\" China is also unhappy with Japan's plans to build a missile defense system in cooperation with the United States.\nSovereignty of the island is disputed between Japan and China. Both the People's Republic of China and the Republic of China claims soveregnty on the island.\nDespite Japan's claims of sovereignty over the islands, China has begun to claim some of the region's valuable oil and natural gas deposits to help alleviate the shortages for China's growing economy. China recently allowed leased oil drilling to commence within the area that Japan has declared as an \"Economic Exclusion Zone\". Japan has lodged diplomatic protests to ask China to discontinue these projects, but China does not recognize Japan's claims, arguing that Chinese territorial rights end at the edge of the Asian continental shelf underneath the East China Sea.\nOn March 24, 2004, seven Chinese activists were arrested by Japanese authorities when they landed on the islands with the intent to stay for three days. At the time, the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs lodged a protest with the PRC. The activists were deported by Japan after the PRC demanded their return.\nThe name of the island chain is disputed. The Japanese refer to the islands as \"Sento Shosho\" or \"Senkaku Retto,\" the People's Republic of China (PRC) and the Republic of China (Taiwan) call the island the same name. In PRC's pinyin system, the names spells \"Diaoyu Dao\" and in ROC's system \"Tiao Yu Tai.\""}

He was 85.\nZhao was a reformer within the communist party who acted against corruption, and created programs of economic and agricultural reform that allowed parts of China to recover from the failure and famine of the Great Leap Forward. He disbanded communes and allowed farmers to tend their own land; he also introduced the plan to create special economic hubs in coastal areas \u2014 a system that is the current model for China.\nIn the 1980s, Zhao's success gained him a variety of top posts within the Poliburo of the Communist Party, including in 1987 the post of General Secretary \u2014 highest rank within the party. He was seen by outsiders as a potential successor to the de facto Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping, though on one occasion Zhao had denied that he would be fit for the role.\nZhao's rule came to an end in 1989, as he sided with the student protesters advocating democracy in the Tiananmen Square in Beijing. Zhao's position was not held by others within the core of the Politburo, and he was stripped of his post. \nOn May 19, 1989, Zhao arrived at Tiananmen Square and spoke to the protesters. In tears, he apologized for \"coming too late\" and asked them to abandon their protest.\nShortly afterward, Zhao was placed under house arrest despite never being charged. Two weeks later on June 4, the army was sent into the square to disband the protestors, leading to hundreds of deaths.\nHe never again made a public appearance and was confined to a courtyard house not far from Tiananmen Square. From there, Mr. Zhao ventured outside only rarely and under heavy escort to play golf at nearby courses.\nEven in death, the government continues to fear that his name might ignite discontent among impoverished farmers, intellectuals, the unemployed and others who want to see sweeping political reforms.\nSecurity at Tiananmen Square was visibly tightened in the days leading to Zhao Ziyang's death, as reports emerged that he had slipped into a coma. \nOfficial announcement of his passing Monday came via a short dispatch by the state news agency, which briefly said that he had died at a Beijing hospital after suffering longtime lung and heart ailments. The report referred to the deceased leader as \"Comrade Zhao\" and made no mention of his former titles.\nHe had been in a coma since Friday after suffering multiple strokes, a source close to his family said.\nHe is survived by his second wife, Liang Boqi, four sons, and a daughter."}

The basis for the court's decision was the section of the Swedish constitution relating to freedom of the press. Since the university was a public body, it was obliged to turn over any documents to any citizen upon request unless the document was protected by a specific paragraph in the \"Secrecy Law\".\nThe university argued that the material should be protected by a paragraph referring to the confidentiality of information about patients. The courts decided, however, that they could hand over the data (about 70 shelf feet of documents) if they specified a proviso that would preserve confidentiality. The university was thus ordered to first write a proviso (set of conditions) for K\u00e4rfve and Elinder and then hand over the data. \nGillberg and the other members of the research group refused to comply. They referred to the promise they had given to the participants in their studies that all the data would be kept completely confidential. They also argued that the data was particularly sensitive since the research concerned psychological and psychiatric disorders among children, and that it was impossible to anonymize the data beyond possible identification. When they had pursued all legal avenues without success, someone apparently destroyed the documents in May 2004.\nThe Gillberg group received considerable support from other medical researchers and from their university. They felt that important clinical research could be jeopardized unless complete confidentiality could be promised to the patients.\nEva K\u00e4rfve stated that she was happy with the prosecution and that it would \"strengthen the protection of research in Sweden.\""}

Their members are regularly searched by Colombian authorities. Worldwide, police agencies have an interest in FARC members because of their involvement in international drug trafficking.\nThe arrest of Granda has caused disagreement. The FARC accuses Colombian authorities of capturing Granda inside Venezuelan territory. Venezuelan President Chavez claims Colombia invaded Venezuelan territory and possibly bribed Venezuelan officers. Colombia says the arrest occurred inside Colombian territory and that Granda was moved to Colombia by Venezuelans.

This growth is surprising, seeing as most analysts predicted that GDP would grow by only 5-6% in 2004. Growth was driven mainly by domestic consumption, as well as by increased foreign investment and a good agricultural yield. The growth of 8.3% was also one of the highest in Europe, exceeding by far that of Romania's neighbours Bulgaria, Hungary and Poland.\nDespite the introduction of a new 16% flat tax for personal income and company profit, which will boost foreign investment, economic growth is expected to ease in 2005 to around 5.5%. However, on the back of projected economic reforms, growth is expected to break the 8% barrier again in 2006.\nRomania, for a long time lagging behind its neighbours in terms of economic growth and per-capita GDP, has posted strong growth since 2001. However, while having one of the highest standards of living in southeastern Europe, Romania continued to lag behind Central Europe in terms of per-capita GDP, which is now about half that of Romania's neighbour Hungary and around one-third of the European Union average.\nWhile some analysts predict that the current high rate of growth is due to a long time of GDP decline in the 1990s, others say that Romania is entering a cycle of boom which will continue for many years to come. Many of the new EU member states, as well as candidate countries such as Romania, have recorded solid growth in the last few years and are aspiring to emulate Ireland, whose Celtic Tiger era of growth resulted in it transforming itself from one of the poorest countries in Western Europe to one of the wealthiest. The new 16% flat tax rate, as well as Romania's relatively low wages, are expected to boost foreign investment, which drove Ireland's economic boom and is also expected to play a major part in Romania's economic transformation.\nThe HVB Group mentioned in its recent report about the transition economies of Central and Eastern Europe that, by 2010, Romania will be a highly attractive destination for foreign investors and will continue growing economically at a solid rate. Romania's 2007 entry into the European Union is expected to further improve its reputation in the business world. However, although having a liberal fiscal policy, Romania must work in cutting red tape and discouraging corruption, which remain obstacles to further growth.\nInflation.\nRomania's inflationary statistics also suggested a positive trend, with prices growing by 9.8% between year-end 2003 and year-end 2004. While this is still one of the highest rates of inflation in the region, it compared favourably to the 22.5% inflation recorded in 2002 and the 14.5% recorded in 2003. \nThe T\u0103riceanu government's inflationary target in 2005 is 7%, even though many international analysts, including the HVB Group, suspect this will be hard to reach due to the predicted widening of the budget deficit in 2005. The budget deficit is expected to increase because of the new tax system, which will lead to lower revenues for the government. Romania has long been criticised for its high rate of inflation and has been pressured by the International Monetary Fund to reduce its budget deficit."}

On Sunday, January 16, the Romanian public raised the equivalent of 395,000 euro in a telethon, while the Romanian Government pledged 150,000 euro for the relief effort.\nThe artistic event is also part of a campaign by the Bucharest City Hall that seeks to relaunch the image of the Romanian capital as a creative and colourful metropolis. The city will be the first in southeastern Europe to host CowParade, the world's largest public art event, between June and August this year."}

They discussed the crisis between Colombia and Venezuela. \nThe crisis began after the arrest of the FARC leader Rodrigo Granda, also known as Ricardo Gonzalez. Venezuela argued that Granda's arrest is illegal and that Colombia invaded Venezuelan territory in the course of the arrest. Colombia, in turn, claimed the arrest occurred inside Colombian territory and accused Venezuela of harboring terrorists.\nLula and Uribe did not say very much publicly, opting instead to have a reserved conversation to discuss the matter. Lula proposed a bilateral solution between Colombia and Venezuela, suggesting himself as a peacemaker between the two countries.\nLater, Lula talked by phone with Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez. The Brazilian Minister of Foreign Relations Celso Amorim will coordinate the eventual Brazilian efforts to help solve the crisis.\nYesterday, after a meeting with Peruvian Minister of Foreign Relations Manuel Rodr\u00edguez, the Colombian Minister of Foreign Relations, Carolina Barco, said in a interview with Radio Caracol that Colombian chancellery is engaging in a dialogue in the best terms with the Venezuelan chancellery and that there exists the best spirit to solve the problems.\nLula's role.\nBrazil has a seemingly good relationship with Colombia. In March 2003, Lula met Uribe and they discussed the concerns of both countries. They also discussed the FARC. Brazil did not want to name the FARC as a terrorist group. Amorim explained that it is not part of Brazilian policy to classify political groups as terrorists. Brazil, however voted for a \nOrganization of American States motion condemning an alleged terrorist FARC attack in Colombia , .\nChavez and Lula have a close relationship. President Lula repeatedly defended Chavez. Both men have been said to manifest support and empathy for the Cuban President Fidel Castro, though Lula has distanced himself publicly from the Cuban leader. \nIn an interview with the Washington Post not long after his election, Lula said, \"In relation to Cuba, let's not confuse the passion that my generation has for the Cuban revolution and what it represented then with any approval of the Cuban regime today. I defend religious freedom, cultural freedom, freedom for trade unions and political freedom.\" However, Lula tried to expel the New York Times journalist Larry Rohter because of writings deemed libelous , . Also Lula tried to create a council formed by sympathizers and members of his party to control the press , . \nThe FARC is a member of the Foro de S\u00e3o Paulo organization led by Lula.\nLula and others members of his party already have received FARC leaders many times , , , . Lula supports the FARC position against the influence of the United States in Latin America. According to the Folha de S\u00e3o Paulo newspaper, in a interview on the Brazilian television channel \"Record\", Lula said FARC should become like the Workers' Party and should participate in Colombian elections. He denied the supposed Workers' Party relationship with the FARC and said the term \"axis of evil\" used to describe the relationship between Brazil, Venezuela and Cuba was a bad joke . \nAccording to Lula, Brazil wants to establish good relationships with all countries, including the United States. However, he leads the Foro de S\u00e3o Paulo, an organization whose members the US government sees as enemies. These members include: National Liberation Army, the FARC, Farabundo Mart\u00ed National Liberation Front, Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity, Sandinista National Liberation Front, Tupamaros, and the Communist Party of Cuba."}

He was taken prisoner of war by the Germans in Volhynia but managed to escape and returned to Warsaw. He quickly joined the Polish resistance and in 1940 became the main organiser of the Akcja N, a secret organisation preparing German-language newspapers and other propaganda material pretending to be official German publications, in order to wage psychological warfare against German troops.\nHe also served as an envoy between the commanders of the Home Army and the Polish government in exile and other allied governments. During one of such missions in July 1944, he arrived in Warsaw only a few days before the Warsaw Uprising broke out. During the Uprising he took an active part in the fights against the Germans and also organised the Polish radio that maintained contact with the Allied countries through daily broadcasts in Polish and English. Shortly before the capitulation of the Polish capital, he was ordered by the Polish commander-in-chief Tadeusz B\u00f3r-Komorowski to leave the city and find his way to London. He managed to evade being captured and reached Great Britain, bringing with him large quantities of documents and photos. For his bravery and his travels through the German-occupied Europe he was awarded with the Virtuti Militari, the highest Polish military medal. He also gained a nick-name \"Courier from Warsaw\" (\"Kurier z Warszawy\"), which he later used as a title of his memoirs.\nAfter the war, Jan Nowak-Jeziora\u0144ski stayed in the West, initially in London and then in Munich and Washington. Between 1948 and 1976 he was one of the most notable personalities of the Polish division of the BBC radio agency. In 1952 he also became the head of the Polish section of the Munich-based Radio Free Europe. Through his daily radio broadcasts he remained one of the most popular radio personalities, both in communist-held Poland and among the Polish diaspora in the West. After giving up his posts in 1976, he became one of the most prominent members of the Polish American Congress and headed the organisation between 1979 and 1996.

It is not expected to cause any major change on Taipei's policy toward Mainland China.\n\"The cabinet has tendered its resignation,\" Chen Chi-mai, spokesman for the cabinet, told a news conference on Monday. \nThe entire 20-member cabinet, including Premier Yu Shyi-Kun, tendered its resignation to give President Chen Shui-bian a free hand in choosing a new set of ministers.\nThe move follows the parliamentary election last December, in which President Chen's Democratic Progressive Party and its allies failed to win a majority over the rival opposition coalition, led by the Nationalist Party of China \u2014 also known as Kuomintang (KMT).\nIn Taiwan's political system, the president is the head of state and appoints the premier, who heads the cabinet and runs the day-to-day affairs of government. The premier liaises with parliament (the Legislative Yuan), which has the final say over lawmaking. \nPresident Chen is expected to name the new premier on Tuesday. Whomever is appointed will form a new cabinet in consultation with Mr. Chen. Mr. Chen is widely expected to name Frank Hsieh, the mayor of Kaohsiung City and close ally, to this post. The choice of premier may signal Mr. Chen's desired successor for 2008 when his two-term limit ends. Several key members of the outgoing cabinet are expected to retain their jobs.\nPhilip Yang, political professor at the National Taiwan University, doesn't expect Taiwan's policy towards the People's Republic of China to change much with a new cabinet.\n\"It is expected that those cabinet members who are in charge of cross-strait relations will remain unchanged. So I believe in terms of policy, there will be no major changes,\" he said.\nBeijing sees Taiwan as a breakaway province and has threatened to attack if independence is declared. Pro-independence supporters, such as Mr. Chen, maintain there are two countries. The two sides split amid civil war when the Communists established the People's Republic of China on the mainland while the Nationalists moved their government to Taiwan and maintained the seat of the Republic of China, which the Communists regard as defunct and illegitimate. \nMr. Chen won re-election in last year's presidential election by a narrow margin, but his pro-independence party then failed to gain a majority in the December parliamentary elections as had previously been predicted. \nAnalysts suggest the military threat and the growing economic relationships between the two sides swayed Taiwan's voters to not provoke Beijing. Professor Yang thinks if there are going to be changes in Taiwan's new cabinet policy towards mainland China, it will result from public pressure to reduce tensions.\n\"In terms of policy there will be no major changes, but definitely some pressure from the people and from the parliament,\" he said. \"[They] would ask the government to be more active to improve cross-strait relations.\"\nThe new cabinet will take office on February 1, along with the new parliament.

The sentences come as the government struggles to deal with a rising tide of sometimes violent protests by farmers angry over what they allege are illegal land seizures by government-backed developers. \nFor months, a group of farmers camped outside the local headquarters of the Communist Party in Sanchawan village, in China's Shaanxi province. The farmers were protesting plans by developers to seize their land and pay only $60 each in compensation.\nThe farmers said the compensation from the government-backed developers was too small, and the seizure was illegal.\nFive months into the sit-in, paramilitary police descended on the village and arrested the group for charges including obstructing traffic and attacking government agencies. The detainees' sentencing came last week. Relatives of those arrested say some received sentences of two to six years, while a man accused of leading the demonstration was ordered to spend 15 years in prison. \nThe sentencing has drawn protests from overseas human rights advocates like Nicholas Becquelin of the New York-based Human Rights in China group, who says the government has recently tried to stop the protests from spreading by imposing a general ban on news coverage of land seizures. \nHe said the authorities are hoping the stiff sentences will discourage others from protesting.\n\"The government is sending a message to petitioners and protesters, saying that if they resort to this kind of demonstrations that the Communist party does not allow, they will be seriously punished,\" said Mr. Becquelin.\nChina's economy is booming and cases like the one in Shaanxi province are becoming more common, with more peasants losing their farmland to make way for development projects backed by local governments.\nOfficials estimate 70 million people have lost their land to the construction of roads, dams, housing projects and factories. Analysts predict that number will continue rising as the economy continues to expand.\nAs the economy grows, so do the disparities between rich and poor. The central government says the latest figures, from the year 2003, show farmers' per capita disposable income totaled about a third of that of urban dwellers. \nDespite the government's assertion last year that rural incomes are growing, many of China's 800 million farmers live in deep poverty. Under China's socialist system, farmers cannot own the land they till, but rather lease it from the state. Plots are small and yield barely enough for families to eat. \nLocal officials have the power to make decisions on the land, leaving peasants little recourse should the officials choose to seize their plots. \nAnger at the seizures has fueled desperation among peasants who complain they have not benefited from China's economic growth in the same way as people along the industrialized East Coast. \nSome demonstrations have turned deadly. Last November, government troops opened fire and killed a number of protesters in a remote part of Sichuan province, where thousands of residents were protesting the seizure of their land for construction of a hydroelectric dam project.

The military in the field are using these units to improve their intelligence gathering capabilities. \nThe news of the existence of these units has sparked controversy over the manner in which they were created as well as the manner in which they are used. According to the original report in the Washington Post, these units have been in operation for two years. They deploy small teams of caseworkers, linguists, interrogators and technical specialists to work alongside Special Operations forces. This is readily acknowledged by the Pentagon. \nHowever, there is some dispute as to the accuracy of other items mentioned in the Washington Post report. According to the Post, the units were designed to report directly to Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfield, and use \"reprogrammed\" funds, or funds not appropriated with Congressional authority or oversight.\nThe Pentagon, however, denies these accusations. In a statement made by Pentagon spokesman Lawrence DiRita, \"There is no unit that is directly reportable to the Secretary of Defense for clandestine operations as is described in The Washington Post\". Mr. DiRita went on to say, \"Further, the Department is not attempting to 'bend' statutes to fit desired activities, as is suggested in this article.\"\nPentagon officials told reporters that the funding and other arrangements for these new units had been worked out in close coordination with the CIA and that appropriate congressional committees had been fully informed. One defense department official explained that part of the reason for the controversy might be that lawmakers contacted by the Post or other news organizations for information may not have recognized the new name given to the units, \"Strategic Support Teams\". According to this official, when these lawmakers were originally briefed on these new intelligence units they were referred to as \"Humint Augmentation Teams\" (Humint is short for Human Intelligence, referring to information gathered by human operatives). The Pentagon later changed the official name of the units to Strategic Support Teams. The official spoke on the condition that he not be identified.\nMany Democrats, such as Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif) and Rep. Ellen Tauscher (D-Calif) are calling for congressional hearings to investigate the matter. \n\"While I fully support improving the ability of our men and women in the field to get accurate real time intelligence, the creation of this unit raises a number of questions that this committee has a duty to examine,\" Tauscher said. \nMany Republican lawmakers have stated their opposition to such hearings, such as the Chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, Rep. Duncan Hunter (R-Calif).\n\"The notion by some that various steps taken by the Department of Defense to enhance such intelligence is somehow sinister and illegitimate is nonsense,\" Hunter said. \nThe Undersecretary of Defense, Stephen A. Cambone, met with the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, John Warner (R-Va) and the panel's top Democrat, Carl Levin (D-Mi) for more than an hour on Monday. Warner said he was satisfied by the briefing and would ensure that other committee members were briefed fully as well. \n\"In my opinion,\" he said, \"these intelligence programs are vital to our national security interests, and I am satisfied that they are being coordinated with the appropriate agencies of the federal government.\""}

Robbins is currently filming War of the Worlds and will be seen next in The Secret Life of Words.\nMeanwhile, Documentary category rules for the 78th Annual Academy Awards\u00ae have been changed by the Board of Governors of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to exempt documentaries \"with a true theatrical rollout\" from the rules' television blackout provision. \nThe change will apply to documentaries released during the 2005 Academy Awards year. \nDocumentary branch executive committee chair Freida Lee Mock said the theatrical exhibition requirements of the rules for the documentary awards were instituted in 2003 at the branch's request to encourage commercial theatrical runs for documentary films. \n\"Our new rules had a positive impact,\" Mock said. \"Since 2003 there have been a growing number of documentary theatrical releases, and that growth exploded this summer.\" \nBut some of the films bumped up against the television blackout provisions of the rule and were thereby prevented from having a television exhibition until a nine-month time period had expired. \nThe Academy isn't trying to prevent television exhibition for documentaries that have had a successful theatrical run, Mock said, \"but we want documentaries to be able to exploit their theatrical release as fully as possible, so we've modified the rules to exempt those documentaries from the blackout provisions.\" Even for documentaries with more modest theatrical runs, the 2005 rules reduce the blackout window to six months. \nTo qualify for exemption a film must have had a minimum of 25 commercial exhibitions for paid admission in motion picture theaters in 15 states, each exhibition to be at least two consecutive days. (Exhibitions held at festivals, benefits, special events and the like do not qualify under this provision.) \nThe 2005 rules also contain a provision requiring that short documentaries \"must be contractually available for theatrical release for six months after receiving a nomination\" unless they have met the test for the new blackout exemption."}

Mr. Yu and the entire 20-member cabinet resigned Monday to allow President Chen Shui-bian to reshuffle the cabinet, after his party's coalition lost parliamentary elections last month.\nMr. Hsieh, the 59-year-old mayor of Taiwan's second largest city, Kaohsiung, is a close ally of Mr. Chen and will be expected to closely carry out the president's agenda. Mr. Hsieh served as Chairman of the Democratic Progressive Party from 2000 to 2002.\nPresident Chen praised Mr. Hsieh as \"the best person\" to help open a new era of negotiations with both the opposition and with Mainland China. \nAnalysts suggest that Mr. Chen's appointment may signal President Chen's preference for a successor. Mr. Chen's second term ends in 2008 and Mr. Hsieh has had previous experience as a vice presidential candidate in 1996.\nIn ways, the two men are alike. Both grew up in poor families, graduated from Taiwan's most prestigious National Taiwan University, and passed the bar with the highest score in their junior years in college. Like President Chen, Mr. Hsieh rose to prominence defending the dissidents of the Kaohsiung Incident and went on to serve as a Taipei city councilor and a legislator.\nMr. Hsieh is expected to announce a new cabinet in two days. The cabinet must be endorsed by the new parliament, which convenes February 1. \nAnalysts believe that many key ministers, including those responsible for foreign affairs, defense, and mainland affairs, are likely to retain their posts.\nMr. Hsieh on Tuesday promised to seek co-existence and \"cross-strait peace\" through dialogue with the People's Republic of China. He said the new cabinet must maintain cross-strait stability. He will also need to smooth the economic recovery.\nHe will have to face a parliament in which the opposition holds 114 of the 225 seats. Mr. Chen has complained that passage of his key bills have been slowed by the parliament.\nThe pro-independence policies of President Chen and his Democratic Progressive Party have angered Beijing, which considers Taiwan a breakaway province. Beijing has threatened a military attack if the Taiwan independence is declared. The two sides split amid civil war in 1949 when the Communists established the People's Republic and the Nationalist Party, or Kuomintang, moved the original government to Taiwan where they maintained the Republic of China, which Beijing regards as defunct. President Chen maintains there are two countries.\nThe Kuomintang favors maintaining the status quo. Party leaders say the question of whether Taiwan should be independent or reunited with mainland China should be decided by future generations. The Kuomintang, citing its parliamentary victory, had sought to name its own premier and government.\nPhilip Yang, an associate professor of political science at National Taiwan University, says the recent election's message was that the president and his new premier will have to pay serious attention to relations with Beijing.\n\"A new message from the people [is] demanding the government to pay more attention to enhance cross-straits interaction,\" he said."}

The mission lasted 5 hours, 28 minutes, ending at 1311 UTC.\nThe two astronauts, working in Russian space suits, performed a variety of tasks. Chiao and Sharipov installed a work platform, called the Universal Work Platform, along with its base and associated wiring. They also installed a commercial robotics experiment and a biological experiment on the exterior of the Zvezda Service Module. In addition, they checked vents on systems that help control the Station's atmosphere and relocated a Japanese physical science experiment.\nResidue accumulation around the vents of the Elektron oxygen generator was noted and photographed by Sharipov. Technicians on the ground will analyze the information to determine if this residue has been contributing to the problematic operation of the Elektron.\nDuring this spacewalk, the station again encountered the mysterious forces that have been saturating the Control Moment Gyros during previous spacewalks. Russian thrusters were activated to counter this force.\nThe walk marks Chiao's fifth for 31 hours, 34 minutes, accumulated time and Shapirov's first.\nThis was the 57th space walk conducted at the Station and the 32nd to be based out of the orbital outpost.

Following along with the system source code are 1,670 patents Sun will make available for use by open-source developers.

Open source developers had been becoming concerned that bureaucracy and legal issues associated with software patents could be damaging to their livelihoods and to innovation. The moves by Sun and IBM seem intended to placate this growing fear.\nDynamic Trace, or DTrace is the first OpenSolaris component to be released. DTrace is a performance-analysis tool that tells developers how to optimize their applications for maximum performance. \nThe code is to be released under Sun's own licensing scheme, the Common Development and Distribution License (CDDL) Version 1.0.

SMART-1 caps a streak of major planetary missions by the ESA in the past year.\nTwo features of SMART-1 have brought particular attention to the project: the ion drive and a sophisticated navigational software.\nThe probe features a low-thrust, long-duration ion drive, where ionised particles are accelerated by electromagnets and ejected from the motor of the probe to provide propulsion. The energy for this is supplied by solar panels, potentially allowing months of thrusting.\nThe probe arrived in lunar orbit on November 15, 2004. The ion drive has been firing for much of the time since, leading the probe to orbit ever closer to the lunar surface.\nThe coupling of the camera and the navigational system will allow more precise mapping of the moon's features than ever before. Using very precise positioning, the system will be able to measure the angles of shadows to such a degree that researchers will be able to build a very accurate topographical map of the moon's surface features.\nThe series of images were taken at an altitude of 5,000 to 1,000 km above the Moon to test the onboard camera. On February 9, the ion drive will be turned on once more to drop the probe to a height of 3,000 to 300 km above the surface. From then on, it will begin the bulk of its scientific investigations."}

However, the government of Venezuela has also received criticism for what some feel to be intimidation of journalists and other anti-democratic acts.\nThis year the event has been tarnished by the Brazilian journalist Pol\u00edbio Braga, who alleges illicit negotiations between the World Social Forum and GP Equipamentos El\u00e9tricos Ltd, a Brazilian company contracted to work on the infrastructure for the forum. He also accuses the Brazilian government of trying to stop the police investigation into the matter.\nIn 2006 the forum is scheduled to be held in Venezuela and/or simultaneously in different cities around the world."}

He was sentenced to death, but the sentence was then postponed for two years. \nUpon the expiration of his suspended sentence late last year, Chinese officials suggested they might go ahead with the execution. It was to have taken place last month.\nBut Higher People's Court of Sichuan decided to commute the sentence, saying the monk had obeyed certain conditions that were not disclosed. Officials say he confessed to the bombing, a claim human rights advocates say they do not believe. \nTenzin Deleg, who is widely respected among Tibetan Buddhists, has said he was wrongly accused. \nAnne Callahan, manager of the Free Tibet campaign in Britain, says Communist officials targeted the spiritual leader because they viewed his vast following as a threat to their authority among the large community of ethnic Tibetans in Sichuan province. \nShe says her group believes the real reason for the reprieve of the death sentence was the international pressure brought on Beijing by governments and private organizations. \n\"The reality is that his case generated a whole international campaign on his behalf and has actually highlighted the degree of religious repression in Sichuan now,\" she said. \nThe reprieve came exactly two years after the execution of another man, Lobsang Dhondup, who was tried and convicted along with Tenzin Delek for the 2002 bombings. \nThe Dalai Lama and his Tibetan government in exile, along with several human rights groups, had called for the sentence to be reversed.\nThe United States expressed serious concern about the monk's closed-door trial, saying Chinese authorities failed to provide clear and convincing evidence of guilt. The issue came up during visits to Beijing by Secretary of State Powell and other high-ranking Bush Administration officials. \nOfficials at the U.S. Embassy in Beijing had no immediate comment following the news of the court's decision. \nMeanwhile, Tashi Phuntsog, described as Tenzin Deleg Rinpoche's \"right-hand man,\" walks free.

Zhao's family disagrees with the government over the correctness of Zhao's actions regarding Tiananmen Square. \nState-controlled newspapers and broadcasts have been devoid of news on Zhao's death and on what his eulogy will say. \nCheng Li, a professor of government at Hamilton College in New York, says the Communist leaders have been trying to ensure that Mr. Zhao's funeral and eulogy do not ignite what might be an explosive new debate.\n\"They don't want to see it widely publicized,\" he said. \"Certainly, they don't want to repeat what happened 16 years ago because of the emotions and other things could lead to a very sustained, prolonged event.\" \nAnalysts say the government sees a parallel with the death of another reformer, party leader Hu Yaobang, which sparked the demonstrations in May and June of 1989.\nMr. Zhao, then the Communist party chief, went to the square two weeks before the crackdown and tearfully urged the students to abandon their protest. \nShortly after, the leadership accused him of sympathizing with the demonstrators and trying to split the party.

She had had a tempestuous relationship with her husband, and had previously twice left him to live with a lover. Park reported that she was missing from their home when he returned with his children from a day trip to the seaside resort of Blackpool. Because of her earlier disappearances, he did not report her missing to the police for six weeks, shortly before she would have been expected to start a new school year as a teacher.\nA jury at Manchester Crown Court however heard evidence that the keen climber and sailor had bludgeoned her to death with an ice axe, tied her body up in a foetal position, and wrapped it in plastic and a weighted carpet and dumped the body in Coniston Water, the third largest lake in England. The body was discovered by an amateur diving team in 1997. The jury heard that if the body had been dumped only a few feet further from the shore, it is likely that it would have sunk to the deepest part of the lake beyond the reach of divers, and would never have been found.\nPark was arrested and charged with the murder in 1997, but his trial then collapsed through lack of evidence. Further evidence came to light, including geological evidence that the rocks which were used to weigh down the body were of a rare type which happened to be found in the rockery of the Parks' house, and the meticulous knots used to tie up the body were described as \"unusual\", of the type used by climbers or sailors, and Park was re-arrested in 2004.\nThe prosecution admitted that most of the evidence against Park was circumstantial, and there were some exclamations of surprise in the public gallery when the jury returned its verdict. In a plea of mitigation, defending lawyer Mr Andrew Edis QC said that Park, who had subsequently remarried twice, had lead an otherwise blameless life. Trial judge Mr Justice McCombe said that he was not sure if there was a significant degree of planning in the murder, but he did take into account the degree of violence employed in the killing, and the degree of suffering endured by many people, not least the Park children, because of the concealment of the crime for so long, in passing a sentence of life imprisonment with a recommendation that Park not be considered for parole for 15 years."}

The ceremony marked the first of 48 charter flights allowed to operate between Taiwan and the mainland over the three-week Chinese New Year holiday season. \nLater, a China Southern Airlines plane, which took off from the Guangzhou, landed at Taipei's Chiang Kai-shek International Airport amid similar fanfare. This marked the first successful direct flight across the two sides, still technically at war.\nThe Republic of China government banned direct flights after the Kuomintang defeat in the Chinese Civil War to the Communists caused the government to retreat to Taiwan. Although there is consensus on all sides to resume the three links \u2014 direct postal, telephone, and airline links \u2014 between mainland China and Taiwan, Taiwan's President Chen Shui-bian has been reluctant to move ahead, citing the possibility that the People's Republic of China could disguise troop carriers as commercial airliners to invade Taiwan.\nAll normal airline flights between the two sides have to be routed through a third party \u2014 usually Hong Kong \u2014 making a three hour flight between Taipei and Shanghai last eight hours. \nTaiwanese and mainland airlines are forbidden to travel into their respective airspaces, forcing passengers to change airlines too. These restrictions were first lifted for Chinese New Years in 2003, but those flights still stopped briefly in Hong Kong. \nTaiwanese legislator John Chang, the grandson of former President Chiang Kai-shek, spoke of the flights' significance at the ceremony. \nMr. Chang said that despite differences, the flights symbolize \"the hopes of the two sides for peace, stability, dialogue and mutual development.\"\nMr. Chang had been part of the group of opposition lawmakers that helped arrange the flights.\nThis year's flights were planned after diplomatic negotiations in Macau, ending on January 15. They are aimed to allow the easy reuniting of families which are split between the island and the mainland for the celebrations.\nThe ROC government hopes the flights can form the basis for further negotiations and better relations with the People's Republic of China. However, the PRC, which is refusing to deal with the independence-leaning government of President Chen, is less optimistic.\nMost of the passengers taking advantage of the nonstop flights, running until February 20, are Taiwanese businesspeople who work on the mainland. \nMany Taiwanese have lobbied their government to ease its ban on direct air links, especially as trade continues to grow between the island and the mainland, despite the political tensions. Mainland Chinese officials this month said cross-strait trade had reached a record $70 billion in 2004."}

Due to their inaction and empowerment of the American government, he compares American citizens to \"Good Germans.\" He also charges that the inhabitants of the targets of attack, namely the Pentagon and World Trade Center, have a dubious claim to the title \"Innocent Civilians,\" as the Pentagon was a military target and the WTC was home to many who he alleges profited from the Iraqi Genocide.\nAdministrators defended Professor Churchill's appearance despite the fact that some considered his views repugnant and disparaging.\nAccording to Hamilton College spokesman Michael DeBraggio: \"Hamilton, like any institution committed to the free exchange of ideas, invites to its campus people of diverse opinions, often controversial.\"\nThe University of Colorado's Interim Chancellor Phil Distefano said in a statement:\"I wish to make it clear that Professor Ward Churchill's views of the events of 9/11 are his own and do not represent the views of University of Colorado faculty, staff, students, administration or Regents. While I may personally find his views offensive, I also must support his right as an American citizen to hold and express his views, no matter how repugnant, as guaranteed by the First Amendment of the Constitution.\"\nThe professor's opinions divided New York's Hamilton College, where Churchill is scheduled to speak. Jessica Miraglia, a student at Hamilton, created a poster defending the professor reading \"You don't have to agree with them in order to learn from them.\". Sophomore Matt Coppo, who lost his father in the World Trade Center attacks was angered over the invitation to Churchill. \"Knowing that I'm paying for a person to disrespect my father, it doesn't go over too well in my mind.\" \nTwo congressmen from Colorado asked professor Churchill to apologize for comparing victims of the 9/11 World Trade Center attack to Nazis. Professor Churchill has said that he will not back off his statement."}

First the Property and Casualty business of Travelers was spun off, and now the life insurance division has been sold off. This is primarily because insurance underwriters get a lower price to earnings multiple from the stock market because of the cycles and uncertainty associated with the insurance business. Also, having an insurance underwriter and a bank together does not usually create \"cross-sell\" opportunities, because consumers and businesses almost always buy life insurance and annuities through brokers who have a duty to give them other options.

The diplomatic relationship with the EU had been limited for more than 18 months.\nThe EU relationship with Cuba was injured on March-June 2003 after the arrest and conviction of 75 \"dissidents\" by the Cuban government. In a separate case, three Cubans were executed on foot of a sentence handed down by a civil court, and confirmed on appeal by the Cuban Supreme Court, which found them guilty of hijacking a ferry and endangering the lives of its occupants. Cuba accused the dissidents of collaboration with the US and sabotage against the Cuban communist system. All 75 \"dissadents\" appear to have pleaded guilty of receiving illegal payments from US agents in court when confronted with the evidence. 14 of the 75 convicted mercenaries, who the US continues to insist were \"dissadents\", have since been released on licience. \nCuba and the EU began to come close again after the efforts of the President of the government of Spain, Jos\u00e9 Luis Rodr\u00edguez Zapatero. At that time, the German Chancellor Gerhard Schr\u00f6der didn't agree with Zapatero about unfreezing the relationships between Cuba and the EU. Schr\u00f6der believed Cuba should first show real commitment to improving the human rights conditions on the island. However, on November 25, 2004, the Cuban Chancellor Felipe P\u00e9rez Roque announced the re-establishment of official contacts with the government of Spain.\nOn November 30, 2004, Cuba released four political dissidents: Marcelo L\u00f3pez, Margarito Broche, \u00d3scar Espinosa Chepe and Ra\u00fal Rivero. The Dutch Presidency of the European Union praised the Cuban decision. Cuba said that the decision was not influenced by the Spanish government.\nOn December 15, 2004 the Council of the European Union for Latin America committee recommended the suspension of the diplomatic sanctions against Cuba, according to alleged Spanish diplomatic sources.\nFinally, on January 10, 2005, the Cuban Foreign Minister Felipe Perez Roque told journalists:\"We can say that from this moment onward Cuba has re-established government-level official contacts with all European Union countries.\" On January 31, 2005, the EU council of foreign ministers agreed to a suspension of EU sanctions against Cuba. The international non-governmental organization Reporters Without Borders protested and sent a open letter to the president of the European Commission on February 1, 2005."}

The Act makes no provision for cases such as this, where the detainee is no longer competent to make such a request. Mental ill health is a reported by-product of the DIMIA system of indefinite detention .\nRefugee concern prompted search for identity.\nFellow detainees became concerned for Ms Rau's welfare when immigration authorities failed to remedy her mental ill health, and were unable to identify her. Refugee advocates in contact with detainees then led a campaign to identify the woman, resulting in her family recognising her description.\nThirty-nine year old Qantas flight attendant Cornelia Rau had in fact been listed as a missing person with New South Wales (NSW) police since August of last year, after disappearing in March. A NSW police effort to find her in November failed to identify that she was being held by Australia's Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, meanwhile DIMIA was stumped as to the identity of their German-speaking prisoner.\nThe Immigration Department said it had gone to great lengths to identify of Ms Rau, contacting the police missing persons registry in Queensland, and several foreign governments, but not NSW police missing persons. \"All the information provided by the woman led the department to believe she was an unlawful non-citizen. At no time did she state she was a permanent (Australian) citizen.\"\nPapers, please.\nAborigines at Coen in Far North Queensland had found Cornelia in a disturbed state on March 31 last year, and become concerned, taking her to police for her own safety. The Queensland Police failed to identify her and assumed she was an illegal immigrant since she spoke German. Instead of hospitalising Ms Rau, they handed her over to immigration officials, on April 5.\nAccording to Ms Curr, when she spoke to Ms Rau at Baxter last month, \"Her English was fine. She told me then she really wasn't in touch with reality, but there was a moment of clarity when she just wanted to get out of Baxter. I spoke to a detainee two days ago and he said her English was so good he thought she was an Aussie girl.\" \nMs Rau had arrived in Australia at the age of 18 months from Germany. Cornelia's sister Chris says, \"The two groups who were kind to Cornelia in all this time were the two most downtrodden groups in society -- the Aboriginal people in Cairns and the refugees in Baxter. There's an irony in that\".\nMental health in indefinite, high security detention.\nThe Australian Federal Government Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission (HREOC)'s Immigration Detention Centre Guidelines state that, \"Immigration detainees who are found to be severely mentally ill should be transferred to an appropriate facility as soon as possible.\"\nThe Immigration Department said she had been under mental supervision at all times. \"A number of medical assessments were conducted by healthcare professionals, including doctors, psychiatrists and psychologists,\" a departmental spokesperson said. \nFindings by a number of independent inquiries have shown that long term, indefinite detention, which is the norm within the Australian immigration system, has the unfortunate side effect of inducing mental health problems in individuals who were otherwise healthy on entering the system, and refugee advocates have pointed to this issue previously in cases involving non-citizens.\nCountless human rights violations have been documented within DIMIA's system by the Federal Government's own policing body, HREOC, which has complained repeatedly for years that its recommendations are not being met. Principally, that the system of mandatory detention itself is an infringement of human rights and should be abolished, and that children (of whom there are currently 87 in detention ) should not be held in custody.\nHREOC criticises the general lack of adequate mental health services, the use of isolation detention for behaviour management, detainees' restricted access to legal assistance and lack of information about the application process, their limited access to general information and contact with the outside world, including relatives, and the effects of such long term detention on the detainees, specifically on their mental health. \nPast publicised cases have shown detainees denied any legal avenues they do not explicitly ask for using correct legal/bureaucratic terminology ; failure to provide adequate medical assistance; and habitual isolation of troublesome detainees instead of meeting of their grievances.\nHREOC has the ability to make recommendations only, and it is up to the Government to enforce, or not enforce them.\n\"It's pretty dangerous if you have Alzheimer's disease or you speak a second language right now,\" according to Labor immigration spokesperson, Laurie Ferguson. Mr Ferguson believed Queensland Police and the Federal Government had questions to answer, and that there should be an Inquiry.\nCost.\nAs well as the personal cost to Cornelia Rau and her family and friends, each day a person spends in immigration detention costs the Department between $111 to $725 . According to DIMIA, \"Government policy is that, where practical, immigration detainees should be billed for the cost of their stay in detention.\" It is not known whether the Department intends to bill Ms Rau."}

However, sometime\nduring the last 10 billion years a large fraction of the baryons,\ncommonly referred to as \"ordinary matter\" to distinguish them\nfrom dark matter and dark\nenergy, have gone missing.\nUsing the computer predictions, Nicastro and colleagues\nsearched specifically for the diffuse system of gas clouds\ngalaxies and galaxy clusters form within. Evidence of the\nclouds had been previously detected around our own galaxy and in\nthe Local Group, but the temperature range (a few\nhundred thousand to a million degrees Celsius) and low density\nhave prevented detection outside the immediate neighborhood of\ngalaxies and the reliable estimation of baryon density for the\nentire universe.\nThe clouds were detected using Chandra observations when the\ngalaxy Mkn 421 brightened in X-ray\nemissions. The X-ray spectral data showed two hot gas clouds,\n150 million and 370 million light years distant, absorbing the\nX-rays from Mkn 421. The data shows the presence of carbon,\nnitrogen, oxygen, and neon present in the clouds. Combined with\nother data the research team determined the thickness and mass of\nthe clouds.\nAssuming that the size and distribution of the clouds are\nrepresentative, Nicastro and colleagues made the first reliable\nestimate of average density of baryons in such clouds throughout\nthe Universe, finding it consistent with the mass density of the\nmissing baryons.\nMkn 421 was observed three times with Chandra's Low-Energy\nTransmission Grating (LETG), twice in conjunction with the High\nResolution Camera (May 2000 and July 2003) and once with the\nAdvanced CCD Imaging Spectrometer (October 2002).

According to him, this decision may lead to severe security flaws in .NET. Gosling is currently in Australia, giving talks and visiting friends.\nAccording to Gosling, the problem lies with the programming languages and some of their characteristics: \u201cC++ allowed you to do arbitrary casting, arbitrary adding of images and pointers, and converting them back and forth between pointers in a very, very unstructured way.\" \nThe Java language was developed due to limitations of C++. Gosling began using C++ for the former Sun Microsystems's star-seven project. At that time Gosling concluded C++ was inadequate and created the Oak language. The Oak language would become the language known today as Java. The former star-seven project shares its defining characteristics with networked software applications today: safety and portability.\nGosling continues: \"If you look at the security model in Java and the reliability model, and a lot of things in the exception handling, they depend really critically on the fact that there is some integrity to the properties of objects. So if somebody gives you an object and says 'This is an image', then it is an image. It's not like a pointer to a stream, where it just casts an image.\"\nCharles Sterling, a Microsoft developer and product manager of the .NET framework, didn\u2019t entirely disagree with Gosling\u2019s thoughts. But he said that .NET defines different types of code. And there is the code which is managed by the .NET framework. All new Microsoft languages, such as C# and Visual Basic.NET, produce only code managed by the .NET framework, so they are safe.\nA key idea that has not shown up in Gosling's talk is that Java itself allows a very similar process to occur. Java's JNI (Java Native Interface) allows the integration of the same unsafe code that prompted Gosling's central thesis.\nHowever, Gosling says languages like C and C++ can still produce unsafe code which would not follow the rules of safety of .NET. This sort of code, usually found in old software applications, requires additional .NET permissions to execute. Sterling says it is up to developers to decide whether or not to use unsafe code in their .NET applications.\nReferences.\n "}

This allegation came one day after the former U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker delivered a preliminary report of the investigation into the United Nation's Oil-for-Food program with Iraq under Saddam Hussein. Sumaidaie says he has serious doubts about the role of the former UN secretary-general Boutros Boutros-Ghali although there is no charge against him in the report.\nIn an interview with Voice of America reporter Peter Heinlein, Sumaidaie said: \"In the early days, the secretariat bent over backwards to please the Saddam regime. At that time it was Boutros Boutros-Ghali who was the Secretary-General. And the report asserts that he tried to please the Saddam government by accommodating its requests which laid the basis for most things that went wrong later... What's clear to me is that Saddam and his regime were able to manipulate things in such a way as to get what they wanted out of this program.\"\nIn a recent interview with the New York Times, Sumaidaie said the inquiry's investigators were ignorant of the UN system and that their allegations were silly.\nAfter being questioned by journalists, the current UN secretary-general Kofi Annan said: \"Each Secretary-General has to do things his way and in accordance with the circumstances that he finds himself in. I think Mr. Boutros-Ghali has indicated in the report, the environment and the circumstances in which he was taking those decisions and I don't want to second-guess him.\"\nOn Friday, Annan said there were some hard knocks in the report and said he would take action promptly: \"We do not want this shadow to hang over the UN, so we want to get to the bottom of it.\""}

If exit poll indications are borne out, his Thai Rak Thai (Thais Love Thais) party will win in a landslide, to become the first single party majority in Thailand's relatively short history of parliamentary democracy.\nThe Thai Rak Thai (TRT) Party looks set to secure approximately 375 seats in the election, allowing them to form the first single-party elected government in Thailand's history. The main opposition party, Pak Prachatipat (Democratic Party), had hoped to secure 201 seats to prevent a TRT majority but conceded defeat long before the ballots were completely counted. The leader of the Democrats, Banyat Bantadtan, has announced he will resign.\n\"I would like to congratulate Thai Rak Thai for achieving its goal of being a single-party government,\" Banyat Bantadtan, leader of the Pak Prachatipat is quoted by the Independent as saying. \"I would like to encourage the two other opposition parties to join the Democrat party in monitoring the government for the benefit of the people.\"\nTRT has promised to eradicate poverty, by spending $60 billion on new infrastructure and pushing ahead with privatisation of state firms against fierce opposition from unions. Cheap loans and subsidised healthcare for Thailand\u2019s poor rural areas sweetened the deal.\nHistory and issues.\nAlready making history as the first elected PM to serve a full term, Thaksin is widely viewed as turning the recent Tsunami disaster into a political asset. When five- to eight-thousand Thais and foreign tourists were killed in the disaster, Mr. Thaksin responded by touring affected regions, refusing international aid loans, and promising farmers, fishermen, and the tourism industry support and compensation.\nThailand's economic growth rate during the past term in office had broken 6 per cent, second only to China, and rural income soared by 20 per cent.\nAnother big issue during the previous term was conflict between security forces and Muslim insurgents in the three southernmost provinces of Narathiwat, Pattani and Yala. With around 10-30,000 troops on duty guarding polling stations, no overt violence arose during the vote, although there had been around 600 deaths in the past 13 months.\nThaksin himself has been dogged by conflict-of-interest and nepotism allegations, including in 2001 charges of concealing financial assets, which could have put him out of politics for five years. A controversial 2003 campaign against drug users was widely seen as amounting to simple assassination of drug dealers, with several hundreds or thousands of alleged extra-judicial killings condemned by the United Nations.\nAfter first entering Thai politics in 1994 as head of the anti-corruption Palang Dharma Party, the multi-billionaire head of telecom giant Shin Corporation had set about building TRT for the 2001 election. Forming a coalition from previous parties and factions, Thaksin was seated as PM with 248 seats of 438 to TRT.\n\"Free, but not fair\".\nElection officials said there were 146 allegations of fraud which merited investigation, with opposition and independent observers saying that vote buying had started weeks ago. However, more than 70 percent of the 44.8 million eligible voters cast ballots in the country's population of 62 million.\n\"The election may be free, but I don't think fair,\" said Somsri Hananuntasuk of the Asian Network for Free Elections, citing reports that party workers were paying Bangkok slum dwellers 200 baht ($5.21) each for votes.\nOfficials were reportedly planning to confiscate mobile phones at polling booths and to arrest voters who snapped a picture of their completed ballot papers with a camera phone as proof to claim a payment, though whether any such incidents occurred is unknown.\nTwo Election Commission volunteers were killed in the south by gunmen during campaigning last month, but, according to General Kowit Wattana, Thailand\u2019s police chief, \u201cAmbushes and killings of candidates are down from four years ago.\u201d"}

The scores given to the countries ranged from 1 to 10, 10 being the highest. The final composite score was calculated as a weighted average of the scores of the nine indicators. Some indicators, such as labour costs, had more weight than others.\nRomania's final score was 7.08 points, edged out in Europe by only Bulgaria (7.08 points), Slovakia (7.12 points) and Czechia (7.26 points). Romania's strengths lay in the workforce cost category, where it received a score of 9.49, and in the geographical proximity chapter, where is received 8.35 points. It also scored well in the categories of economic stability and political and security risks, with 7.2 points each. The country's weaknesses were mainly in the infrastrucutre chapter, where it received just 4.6 points.\nRomania is further expected to improve its score in the coming years, as the effects of its new 16% flat tax rate on personal income and corporate profit come into effect, and as the country joins the European Union in 2007.\nThe worldwide leader in attractiveness for business relocation was India, with 7.76 points, due mainly to very low labour costs, high skill levels and a stable legal system. India edged out China by a considerable margin, with China being ranked second, with 7.34 points. China lags behind India mainly due to its lack of a well-developed legislative system.\nSurprisingly, wealthy countries such as Japan, Norway and Denmark ranked very low, mainly due to their very high cost of labour.\nReferences.\n "}

The decision proved controversial among Brazilians.\nIn Brazil, those interested in following a diplomatic career first must study at the Brazilian school of diplomats: the Rio Branco Institute (IRBr).\nAfter having passed the Rio Branco Institute's (IRBr) entrance examination, the student becomes a Third Secretary. The career path then continues to Second Secretary, First Secretary, Counselor, Second Class Minister, and First Class Minister or Ambassador. \nThe candidate must fulfill the following requirements before signing up for the entrance examination to IRBr:\nbe Brazilian by birth, have a clean criminal record, be up-to-date with military and electoral obligations, and have concluded a full undergraduate course recognized by the Ministry of Education before the date of inscription.\nThe course of study is 2 years long. In the first year, the student has lectures in International Public Law, Economics, Brazilian Foreign Policy, History of International Relations, Theory of International Relations and Brazilian Readings, Diplomatic Language, English, French, and Spanish. For every three class hours on concepts, there is one lecture, seminar, workshop or debate guided by an expert in the field.\nIn the second year, the student develops his diplomatic professional skills. He works as a trainee in different units of the government and at Brazilian embassies and consulates in South America and Mexico.\nThe following written tests are part of the entrance examination: Portuguese, English, French and Spanish languages; History, Geography, Brazilian and International Law, Brazilian and International Economy, and International Politics. Also, the following oral tests are required: International Politics, English, and Portuguese language.\nUntil 2004, the English language tests could eliminate a candidate. However, on December 7, 2004, the Brazilian Minister of External Relations Celso Amorim changed the entrance examination rules. Failing the English test no longer removes the student from the program. \nThe following tests can still remove a person from the program: Portuguese language, History, and Geography. \nThe Minister Celso Amorim explained his decision: \"This is a democratic decision. I would rather have a diplomat who knows Portuguese and Brazilian History well than another one who knows English well\".\nHowever, the decision proposed by the Ministry of External Relations caused some controversy.\nThe Senator and former diplomat Arthur Virg\u00edlio(PSDB) sent a letter to Minister Celso Amorim protesting against the change in the entrance examination to IRBr. He said that the minister's decision is nonsense, a symbolic protest against the USA. The decision minimizes the importance of English in the world. According to him, the government is being underhanded. \"The question is not to love or to hate the United States, but to recognize their enormous weight, until bothering, in the world-wide scenario,\" he added. \nThe journalist and high critic of the government and the Workers' Party (PT), Percival Puggina, said: \"On March 18, 2004, during a opening speech of a popular restaurant of Coca-Cola in Belo Horizonte , President Lula said: 'I spent much time in my life thinking that if you wanted to be anti-American you should not drink Coca-Cola. Later, I got more mature and realized that there is nothing better than waking up at night and finding a Coca-Cola in the refrigerator.' However, Lula\u2019s anti-Americanism which still remains is more naive than not drinking Coca-Cola. The Ministry of External Relations under the rule of Celso Amorim gives us a clue when it eliminates the English knowledge skills as a requisite to the entrance at the Rio Branco Institute. I assume that this is a kick in both Bush\u2019s groin and in Blair\u2019s ankle. Cam\u00f5es is thankful, but he excuses the courtesy.\"\nIn an interview with the Brazilian newspaper Folha de S\u00e3o Paulo, the Minister Celso Amorim told:\u201dIt should be explained that the English language was not removed from the examination, and it will not stop being obligatory; it will just not remove students anymore. Brazilian diplomats will still have to know English as well as other languages too. What the Itamaraty (the Brazilian Ministry of External Relations) decided was to take for itself the costs of the necessary complementation so that the diplomat has the domain of the language.\u201d Amorim also added: \u201dThere are many people who I knew during my life with all the requisites to be diplomats, but who had difficulty to pass in an examination of eliminatory English.\u201d\nAccording to Amorim, the English language elimination test favors the children of diplomats. Ricardo Neiva Tavares, spokesman of the Itamaraty, says that with the changes candidates of all regions of the country can compete evenly to enter the diplomatic career.\nThe former chancellor Celso Lafer criticized the decision: \"Portuguese is not the language used in international communication.\" According to him, the change in the admission examination is a false idea of democratization.\nCristovam Buarque professor of University of Brasilia, senator (PT) and former minister of Education during Lula\u2019s government said: \u201cThe knowledge of foreign languages, especially of English, is absolutely necessary to the diplomat. But this knowledge little says about the potential of creativity, knowledge, and ability of a youth who intends to enter the diplomatic course. Henry Kissinger, for example, would have been disapproved of in our course of diplomacy, since he still speaks with a German accent.\u201d"}

Ms Fiorina's resignation was the result of a disagreement with the board over the future of the company. Often cited as America's most powerful businesswoman, Ms Fiorina presided over the multi-billion dollar merger between Hewlett Packard and Compaq Computers in 2002. \nThe move comes after several months of intense speculation about her future with the company. Having promised billions in annual savings to the company from the 2002 merger, the combined company failed to keep pace with competitors such as Dell, or to deliver any significant increases in profits, particularly in the personal computer market. A recent investigation by Fortune magazine highlighted the fact that the firm's highly profitable printer business supported the lower-margin computer business. \nAfter the announcement, HP shares surged 10% on Wall Street against a generally poor performance by the major indices."}

The group also said in a statement that it should have been consulted first, a view shared by another militant group - Islamic Jihad.\nBoth groups have largely observed an unofficial ceasefire for the past three weeks, having reached an understanding with Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas that would enable him to negotiate with Israel in an environment of relative calm.\nThe groups appear to have come to an agreement that they should continue to observe a month's calm, as agreed with Abbas in late January. Hamas spokesman Mushir al-Masri told Aljazeera that Hamas leaders would be seeking a meeting with Abbas within the next few days to discuss the summit. Masri, however, said that the Sharm el-Sheikh talks had been \"disappointing,\" as the agreement did not represent many of the Palestinian groups.\nKhadir Habib, a spokesman for Islamic Jihad, said, \"Islamic Jihad has endorsed a one-month period of quiet and we will respect it\", indicating that some Palestinian groups may be willing to withdraw from violence in order to give the new peace process time to develop, however, some violence and hostility have greeted the new ceasefire, with gunfire from an Israeli settlement which has reportedly critically injured a 22-year-old Palestinian man. The Israeli army said it is to check the report."}

The explosion occurred shortly before King Juan Carlos and Mexican President Vicente Fox, were due to open the ARCO art fair.\nForty-three persons were hurt, including 6 police officers. Reuters reports 24 were taken to the hospital, though none were seriously injured. The Juan Carlos I Convention Center suffered major damage to its facade from the blast.\nExplosives experts estimated the size of the bomb between 20 and 30 kg (44-66 lb) of explosive material, according to Spain's Interior Minister Jos\u00e9 Antonio Alonso.\nThe blast is the most serious explosion in Spain since the March 11, 2004 al-Qaeda train bombings. It coincides with a police crack-down on the Basque separatist group ETA in the lead up to the Basque regional elections in April.\nThe Basque newspaper Gara received a warning from a caller claiming to be with the separatist group ETA half an hour before the blast, announcing that a car bomb would explode soon after.\nETA grew out of a call for action against Francisco Franco, who ruled Spain from 1939 until his death in 1975. A Basque nationalist movement, ETA grew into a guerrilla force which, to date, is responsible for killing more than 800 people.\nThe goals of ETA are to force the creation of an independent Basque nation, including both the French and Spanish Basque regions. Initially, under the Franco dictatorship and during the transition periods following his death, ETA enjoyed widespread support in the Basque communities. With the increasing radicalism and violence of their methods, this popularity has waned, and organizations such as \"Gesto por la Paz\" (the Association for Peace in the Basque Country) now hold silent protests after ETA acts of terrorism."}

The municipality of Kobe and supporting organisations held one such ceremony in the early morning of January 17. It was the biggest ceremony held that day. Over 5,000 people gathered in the East Playground in the center of city. Participants included surviving citizens and volunteers from around the whole country who had helped out. At 5:43 a.m., just 10 years after the earthquake first occurred, people lit candles in honor of the 6,433 victims. The victims included 133 people who died in the aftermath of the disaster, due to physical or mental difficulties caused by the heavy changes in their life. \nThe earthquake centered around Awaji Island, near the city of Kobe. It measured 7.3 on the Richter Scale, the biggest quake to hit Japan since World War II. Though a great earthquake could theoretically occur in any part of Japan, and scientists had warned of the possibility of earthquakes in the Kansai region, citizens and local government tended to be unaware of this possibility 10 years ago. The death and destruction caused by the quake gave a serious shock to the city's residents. One story of the Kobe city hall was totally destroyed, and a part of Meishin Highway between Nagoya and Kobe was ripped apart; a bus barely avoided falling from the broken highway. Engineers buttressed vulnerable city structures throughout Japan after the earthquake. Research revealed that architecture designed under national earthquake-proof standards had survived the earthquake. Many old buildings were rebuilt, reconstructed, or given structual support. Vulnerable city infrastructure was also attended to; in some areas water and fuel supply had been disrupted for over two months. Many municipalities reviewed their standards for civil engineering design.\nThe earthquake also revealed systematic vulnerability within the Japanese government. The prime minister at that time, Tomiichi Murayama, first learned of the earthquake from a TV news program two hours later, and not from a government report. He called his secretary, who also knew nothing of it. The government improved these weaknesses, and in the case of the Chuetsu Earthquake in October 2004, the prime minister's office was able to quickly deal with the accident.\nAfter the earthquake, many people spent days in shelters. 104,900 houses were completely destroyed, and 144,256 only partly desroyed. The Hyogo prefecture and municipalities provided temporary shelters, called Kasetsujutaku. Such temporary houses had remained since 2000. Since those houses were provided to individuals and not to communities, many people found they were no longer with their familiar neighbors after moving. This caused serious problems among people, especially the elderly. Since 2000, around 200 people have died alone in such temporary houses, to be found only days later; this was considered a serious social problem. A word was even coined for this situation, \"Kodokushi\" (meaning \"death in solitude\" in Japanese), but some say no effective solution has yet been offered. \nThe earthquake has also had a bright side. Before the earthquake, it was not popular to participate voluntarily in social activities in Japan. The earthquake moved many people to join such activities. Since it was close to the end of the Japanese schoolyear, many students could stay in the affected area for long days. And it has been not easy to have a vacation for Japanese workers, as many people took vacations from their company and went to the affected area to help out. This was not just a temporary movement, but influenced people to consider such social engagement as a regular activity (one can see a similar influcence in the case of the Chuetsu Earthquake).\nSources.\n "}

Eyad\u00e9ma was Africa's longest-ruling leader whose 38-year rule was marked by government-sponsored violence and the stifling of political expression. \nThe Constitution of Togo was amended to permit Eyad\u00e9ma to retain power, to allow more than two five-year terms in office, and to lower the minimum age for a president from 45 to 35.

The Prime Minister managed to distance himself from a programme about which his predecessor, The Right Honorable Jean Chr\u00e9tien testified on Tuesday, had as its objective National unity which was a matter under his purview.\nDuring questioning the Prime Minister sought to distance himself from the secret fund used to finance the sponsorship program. The unity reserve, he has said, was \"deeply in the bowels\" of the finance department's budget infrastructure, and did not receive more than semblant review before being approved.\n\"The responsibility of the minister of finance is to set the financial context,\" he testified, \"Once the minister of finance does that, which is essentially the presentation of the budget, his responsibility comes to a total end.\"\nThe scandal involves hundreds of millions of dollars spent in a program created to respond to the 1995 Quebec referendum. The funds were allocated to promote Canada through cultural and sporting events in Quebec, where separatist sentiment was still strong, but a 2003 report from Sheila Fraser, the Auditor General of Canada, suggested as much as $100 million may have been misspent for little or no work on advertising firms with close ties to the Liberal Party of Canada.\nOver the past year the Gomery Enquiry, appointed by PM Martin, has produced little evidence beyond that of the original report, but has provided a forum for the opposition parties to attempt to embarrass the ruling Liberal Party."}

The creator of Death of a Salesman and The Crucible had been suffering from cancer and pneumonia.\nMiller's most famous play, Death of a Salesman, was first performed in 1949. Willy Loman, the central protagonist, became a symbol of the difficulties and frailties of the 'American Dream'.\nArthur Miller became embroiled in 1956 with the Communist hysteria which engulfed the United States as the Cold War began to take shape. When he refused to name friends and colleagues to the House Committee on Un-American Activities, he was held in contempt. The decision was later overturned, however Miller's experiences led him to write The Crucible, a thinly veiled critique of the McCarthyist witch-hunts.\nFans of Miller and his works worldwide paid tribute today to the Pulitzer-prize winning playwright. Zoe Caldwell, American actress who had appeared in Miller's \"The Creation of the World and Other Business\", told AP that Miller \"was a big man and a deeply American man who was lucky enough to have extraordinary women in his life.\" Miller's fame was precipitated by his stormy relationship and subsequent marriage to Marilyn Monroe, which lasted five years.\n\"Mr Miller passed away at his home in Roxbury, Connecticut, last night at 9.17pm of heart failure,\" his assistant revealed.

Estonia, which joined the European Union in 2004, has also exceeded other members and has become a leader in European internet usage.\nThe country is now one of the world's largest per-capita users of online banking, which has surged due to the growth in number of Internet leased-line connections. More impressively, the country is a European leader in terms of the number of permanent high-speed Internet connections. It is outstripped only by Denmark, the Netherlands, Belgium, Sweden, Finland and France, and thus ranks 7th in the 25-member European Union in terms of broadband Internet penetration.\nEstonia's Internet boom has also been due in part of government policy.

Using the \"Table Builder\" service, the country's Crime Statistics can now be examined and analysed online in unprecedented detail.\nAlthough New Zealand Police has previously published \"Official Crime Statistics\" reports online, these statistics have only ever been available at a summary level, as a printed style document. This development allows detailed information, that was only ever available though an information request to Police, to now be seen immediately and desired statistics can be manipulated interactively.\nStatistics are available either nationally or by each Police district and area for the each of the last 10 years or each of the last 24 months. Recorded Crime Statistics can be analysed down to the individual offence, with scene information for recorded and resolved crime. Offender apprehension statistics are also analysed down to the individual offence as well as the age, gender, ethnicity and resolution action taken with the offender.\nThe Recorded Crime Statistics also have a significant amount of accompaning metadata. Relevant legislation for each offence, together with caveats and interpretation notes for each parameter accompany these statistics. Users can now interpret these statistics for themselves, rather than relying on other agencies interpreting, or possibly misinterpreting, their requirements.\nThis innovation appears to be a leading edge breakthrough in publically available crime statistics. Although a number of jurisdictions place statistical reports and summaries of crime statistics on websites, these all are in the form of printed style documents. This move appears to be the first time that internet users can interact with a website to extract their own customised reports from the available crime statistics.\nInternationally, crime statistics have been difficult to obtain, and even more difficult to compare. Interpol, the international policing organisation, for example, does not even make international statistics publically available on its website but restricts them to authorised law enforcement officials. Other countries present their statistics in detailed reports that need to be read and interpreted with care to understand them correctly. Different countries also count crime in different ways, often ignoring less serious offences or only counting the most serious of multiple offences occurring at the same time. \nIn New Zealand's case the basic data is now online. The analysis can be done by the user."}

According to some reports, unsolicited advertisements (\"spam\") for Viagra and similar drugs account for one in four spam messages. \nBACKGROUND\nSpamming remains one of the biggest problems facing email users today. While users and systems administrators have improved their defenses against unsolicited email, many spammers now insert random words or characters into their letters in order to bypass filters. The \"Wikipedia\" article Stopping email abuse provides an overview of the various strategies employed by companies, Internet users and systems administrators to deal with the issue.\nEver since pharmaceutical giant Pfizer promised to cure erectile dysfunction once and for all with its blue pills containing the drug \"sildenafil citrate\", spammers have tried to tap into male anxiety by offering prescription-free sales of unapproved \"generic\" Viagra and clones such as Cialis soft tabs. Legislation like the U.S. CAN-SPAM act has done little to stem the tide of email advertising the products.\nNow Pfizer has entered a pledge with Microsoft Corporation, the world's largest software company, to address the problem. The joint effort will focus on lawsuits against spammers as well as the companies they advertise. \"Pfizer is joining with Microsoft on these actions as part of our shared pledge to reduce the sale of these products and to fight the senders of unsolicited e-mail that overwhelms people's inboxes,\" said Jeff Kindler, executive vice president at Pfizer. \nMicrosoft has filed civil actions against spammers advertising the websites CanadianPharmacy and E-Pharmacy Direct. Pfizer has filed lawsuits against the two companies, and has taken actions against websites which use the word \"Viagra\" in their domain names. Sales of controlled drugs from Canadian pharmacies to the United States are illegal, but most drugs sold in Canada have nevertheless undergone testing by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. This is not the case for many of the Viagra clones sold by Internet companies and manufactured in countries like China and India. While it was not clear that CanadianPharmacy was actually shipping drugs from Canada, Pfizer's general counsel, Beth Levine, claimed that the company filled orders using a call center in Montreal, reported the \"Toronto Star\".\nFor Microsoft's part, they allege that the joint effort with Pfizer is part of their \"multi-pronged attack on the barrage of spam.\" As the creator of the popular email program Outlook, Microsoft has been criticized in the past for the product's spam filtering process. Recently, Microsoft added anti-spam measures to its popular Exchange server. Exchange 2003 now includes support for accessing so-called real-time block lists, or RTBLs. An RTBL is a list of the IP addresses maintained by a third party; the addresses on the list are those of mailservers thought to have sent spam recently. Exchange 2003 can query the list for each message it receives.\nSources.\n\"The first version of this story was written by and using MoonEdit, a free editor for real-time collaboration.

The law aims to ensure that the physicians who graduated at foreign universities are properly prepared for and familiarized with the particular medical conditions of Brazil. Some diseases like malaria and dengue for example are very rare in some countries but are more common in Brazilian territory.\nHowever the Brazilian Ministry of Education (MEC) has come to an agreement with the Cuban government to allow medical students who studied in Cuba to go through a less rigorous examination. Furthermore the MEC wants to exempt the students from the Cuban Escola Latino Americana de Medicina (Latin American Medicine School) or ELAM located in Havana from the examination. Under the agreement, the diplomas of ELAM students would be automatically recognized as valid in Brazil. The Brazilian President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva signed the endorsement of this agreement last year during his visit to Cuba.\nThe Brazilian Regional Council of Medicine from S\u00e3o Paulo is opposed to the idea of accepting the Cuban diplomas and is to dispute the deal in Court. The council says the government decision is unfair and disadvantages Brazilian students. It also says that the decision puts the Brazilian community at risk because of differences between Cuban and Brazilian medical education. Cuban physicians are prepared for Cuban conditions and necessities in health which differ from Brazilian ones. Additionally the council argues that the decision is against the law because the Brazilian 44045 Edict demands that all medical students from foreign schools have to pass a careful examination.\nThe Cuban First Secretary of Technical and Scientific Collaboration in Health, Filisberto Perez, recognizes that both Brazil and Cuba have different models of apprenticeship in medicine. However he believes that Cuba and Brazil can recognize each other's diplomas without difficulty.\nEarly this year, a team of Brazilian inspectors visited the leading medical schools in Cuba to evaluate them so the degrees can be formalized. \nThe MEC's decision has angered some Brazilian students. \"Why would I study for two years so I could get admitted to a Brazilian school if it would be easier to \"buy\" my diploma in Cuba?\" asks Artur Oliveira Mendes in a email sent to a academic organization. He added: \"...our schools of medicine are demoralized before the president's declaration.\"\nThe Brazilian students who are in Cuba were selected by the PT, PCdoB, and MST. \nSenator Jos\u00e9 Agripino Maia (PFL) asked the Minister of Education Tarso Genro to explain before the Senate Education Commission why the students from Cuba are being favoured by the Brazilian government."}

Another shot, at her neck, was fatal. The crime occurred in Anapu, Par\u00e1, inside the Amazon region.\nStang is from Ohio, United States. She had been living in Par\u00e1 for about 38 years. She came to Brazil in 1966. She is a member of the Catholic group Sisters of Notre Dame de Namur. She was an activist and had been working at the region of Anapu. Earlier this year, the missionary received an \"Honorary Citizenship of the State\" from the state of Para. \nStang had been defending the Projeto de Desenvolvimento Sustentado(Project of Supported Development) or PDS for short. The Trans-Amazon development project was designed to generate jobs and income in Anapu. It supported the creation of an fruit processing industry, the construction of two small 500 kilowatt hydroelectric powerplants, and aided reforestation in degraded areas. According to Reuters, loggers, ranchers, and large farmers have been strong opponents of the project and of Stang.\nStang has already received death threats several times before. In March 2004, she asked for help from Brazilian Federal authorities, saying she and other persons were on a death list. \nOn another occasion, in August 2004, she said, \"It is not my safety but that of the people that really matters. All of the Sisters of Notre Dame working in Brazil work very closely with our people and want to be a sign of hope. It is wonderful to be a part of this struggle and this is the contribution of Notre Dame.\"\nThe police requested the arrest of four suspects. Two are the alleged gunfighters Eduardo and Fogoi\u00f3, one is a man called Tato who supposedly contacted the gunfighters and the other one is a farmer, V\u00edtor Miro Bastos de Moura, known as Bida who is believed to have contracted the assassins.\nThe Brazilian police also found a body of another man 500 meters from the place were they found the body of the nun. The murdered man was identified as the peasant Adalberto Xavier Leal, known as the Cabeludo or the Hairy Man. He was working for a farmer who had already invaded the area of the PDS maintained by sister Dorothy. \nThe Brazilian police commissioner Marcelo Ferreira said the peasant was killed as a revenge for the murder of sister Dorothy. He received several shots from an armed group. According to the police the group would be connected to the missionary.\nThe funerals of sister Dorothy Stang will take place in Anapu and Altamira. She is scheduled to be buried on the morning of Feb. 16 in Anapu.\nIn the United States, a funeral mass is scheduled on March 19 at Mount Notre Dame Convent Chapel in Cincinnati, Ohio.\nThe Brazilian government declared the resolution of the case a high priority. President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva sent two ministers and the federal police force to the region. Eight Ministers are scheduled to have an extraordinary meeting and discuss the case.\nRosana Gisele da Costa, a friend of Stang's from the Institute of Environment Research, told reporters that there must be a more active government presence in the region. \n\"Unfortunatelly this is not a isolated case\", da Costa said. \nShe said other people will die if the Brazilian government does not start good political development of the region. She hopes the current actions by the government after the murderer of sister Dorothy will not be temporary.\nExternal links.\nVideo(Terra News) "}

Each gate supported a flag-shaped piece of saffron fabric. The project is scheduled to run from Feb. 12, 2005 through Feb. 27, 2005. The project is sometimes referred to as \"\"The Gates\", Central Park, New York, 1979-2005\" in reference to the time between the artists' initial proposal and the present day.\nInstallation.\nThe installation of the project began on January 3, 2005.\nDuring the week of January 17th, the park was filled with workers using fork lifts to move the rectangular metal plates into position all over Central Park.\nThere were small signs placed on every walkway in the park with alphanumeric codes that the workers were using to place the metal places onto the designated spots.\nAs of January 27, most of the plates had been placed in their positions. Many had small orange plastic markers sticking up a foot or two (around half a metre) from each end, possibly intended to help people find the base plates if they were covered with snow. A major snow storm and extreme cold hampered progress in late January.\nAs of February 7, there were many teams of workers wearing silver grey smocks moving the vertical parts of the gates and attaching them to the base plates. The documentation describes the color as \"saffron\" but local observers describe it as orange.\nWhen attached, the vertical pieces are about 6 metres high, with a cross bar at the top from which the flag piece hangs. The most common width seems to be 11 feet (3.35 metres), though they vary considerably (depending on the width of the path) from around 6 feet (2 metres) to over 20 feet (6 metres).\nOpening.\nOnce Bloomberg released the first piece of cloth, the rest of the gates were opened over the course of the next few hours, with large crowds of people watching. Generally, the crews of people who erected the gates were assigned to open them. They simply had to walk underneath, and use a hook at the end of a long stick to pull a loop hanging from the cross bar of each gate. That opened the cloth bag which contained the \"flag\" part of the gate. The bag fell to the ground, along with a card board tube around which the flag was rolled. The flag then hung majestically from the cross bar.\nAs of Feb. 13, all of the gates have been opened. The project staff is still deployed in the park, patrolling, and replacing a few of the gates that have become damaged. There are many more people then usual walking around in the park, looking and photographing The Gates."}

Gene therapy for cancer has been at an impasse for the last 20 years, said the team, but now an effective carrier has been found in the most unlikely of sources. Essentially, one of the world\u2019s largest health threats is now being considered to fight another.\nSays Dr. Irvin Chen, from UCLA's AIDS Institute, \"The disarmed AIDS virus acts like a Trojan horse, transporting therapeutic agents to a targeted part of the body, such as the lungs, where tumors often spread.\" \nFirst the virus's coating is removed and the virus is reprogrammed so that it recognizes and attaches to the p-lipoproteins of a cancer cell, one of cancer's primary defenses. The retro-virus was also altered with a fluorescent protein for easy tracking within the lab mice. The next step will be to graft a cancer-killing gene onto the modified AIDS virus's genetic structure. \nCurrently, a case of melanoma skin cancer spreading to the lungs is a confirmed death sentence. Should this method of treatment improve into a workable treatment, both life-threatening cancers and the AIDS retro-virus could be effectively neutered. But the team cautions that the treatment is in the very early stages and will take several more years to develop."}

Each country has individual targets.\nOf the major industrialized nations, the USA and Australia are notable absentees from the list of signatories. Both argue that the treaty is flawed and that signing the protocol is not in their national economic interests. The United States produces more CO2 emissions than any other single country in the world, both in total (5,410 million metric tons) and also per capita (20.1 tons per capita).\nDespite this, the way was paved for ratification of the treaty after Russia signed up in November 2004.\nOther criticisms of the protocol are that the treaty does not include India and China, or other developing nations.\nCountries that ratify the treaty will have access to the emerging international market in carbon credits, estimated to be worth billions of dollars each year. This system allows individual countries to trade in their emission allowances - a country can buy credit from another that has cut emissions, and then increase their own carbon dioxide production."}

Designed by the US intelligence agency NSA, SHA-1 has been adopted as an official US government standard and has become widely-used in security applications worldwide, notably digital signatures. The three female researchers, Xiaoyun Wang, Yiqun Lisa Yin, and Hongbo Yu, have reduced the amount of time needed to find two documents with the same signature by a factor of more than 2000.\nThe SHA-1 algorithm is used to compute a short string of numbers, known as a hash, for any digital document. The algorithm is constructed such that small changes in the document cause the hash to change drastically. By this means, the hash can be used to verify that a document has not been tampered with.\nThe attack that Schneier describes is a \"collision attack,\" rather than the more useful \"pre-image\" attack. In a pre-image attack, the codebreaker is able to find a document with different contents that matches an existing hash and so can claim an existing signature was on something else. In the somewhat less valuable \"collision attack,\" the codebreaker is able to devise two documents that both have some particular hash. A adversary might use this to claim that an altered document is the original on the grounds that they have the same hash. A crafty adversary might also be able to trick someone into signing an innocuous document, one of a pair from a collision. The other document, which might not be as harmless, would then also appear to have been signed by the same person. If collisions can be found for SHA-1, then digital signatures will no longer vouch for a document's authenticity.\nThe attack, for now, is more of a theoretical than a practical kind: it would currently take thousands of years on a modern personal computer, and would still be slow even if a large number of computers were used in parallel.\nXiaoyun Wang is currently a professor at Shandong University, while Hongbo Yu is a doctoral candidate at the same institution. Yiqun Lisa Yin is currently a visiting researcher at the Princeton Architecture Laboratory for Multimedia and Security (PALMS). Last year, Xiaoyun Wang and Hongbo Yu also took part in breaking a series of similar algorithms, including the widely used MD5 hash, as documented in their paper presented at the Crypto 2004 conference.\nOfficials from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) have recently recommended dropping SHA-1 in favor of stronger, slower algorithms, such as SHA-256, Federal Computer Week reported on February 7, 2005, just 7 days before Schneier announced the SHA-1 break. Despite deprecating SHA-1, William Burr, the head of NIST's security technology group, said that \"SHA-1 is not broken, and there is not much reason to suspect that it will be soon.\""}

Gurian comments:\nOne major structural difference that Gurian has made clear is that males generally have more activity in the mechanical centers of the brain, while women have more activity in centers of the brain dedicated to verbal communication and emotion. A clear example of this is the hypothetical situation of giving a child a toy. He explains it as such:\nAnother expert, Dr. Marianne Legato, says it all boils down to genetics, noting that the Y chromosome (which only males carry) has \"at least 21 unique genes unique to males which control many of the body's operations down to the level of the cells.\"\nGurian agrees that culture is significant in brain development, but argues that biology plays an equally important role. He makes a point of how the MRI scans show that the female corpus callosum, the center of the brain which regulates communication between the brain's hemispheres, is larger than the male's. On the other hand, the scans also show that information flows more freely between the hemispheres of the male brain. \nThe exact role that brain structure plays in behavior, however, has been an area of considerable contention in science for literally hundreds of years. Early studies in craniometry conducted by Paul Pierre Broca were used to attempt to distinguish differences between human races, though have now been dismissed as scientific racism. The nature-nurture debate has raged for centuries in a variety of forms, without yet any clear resolution as to the role in which innate biological tendencies interact with environmental conditions or willed behavior. As such, studies relating to brain structure and claims to innate behavior often generate substantial controversy.\nMIT anthropologist of science Joseph Dumit's study of brain imaging in his book \"Picturing Personhood: Brain Scans and Biomedical Identity\", noted that the apparent \"transparency\" of such pictures (the appearance that they can be easily interpreted by laymen, when they are often the source of ambiguity and dispute by even highly-trained neurosurgeons) has led to their proliferation as indicators of objective truth in media and in courts of law, and that such conclusions are often knowingly exaggerated by the specialists creating the images for better visual effect. \nThe timing of Gurian's book comes on the heels of another controversy over gender differences sparked by comments made by Harvard president Lawrence Summers, who blamed low numbers of women in the sciences on genetic differences. Summers has been criticized by a large number of academics and scientists, as well as by many news publications, in the wake of what he was reported as saying during a conference on January 14. "}

Remains from Herto, Ethiopia held the previous record of 160,000 years.\nThe findings, published in the February 17 issue of the journal Nature, show the remains \"Omo I\" and \"II\", approach what geneticists believe is the age of the human race \u2014 200,000 years. Due to geological activity in the region, this number may not be accurate; it is feasible that the fossils are as young as 104,000.\nThe uncertainty is due to the method by which they were dated from the known geological age of surrounding rock. The exact dig location where the fossil remains had been excavated in 1967 needed to be relocated.\nIt was determined that \"Omo I\" and \"II\" were buried in the lowest sedimentary layer, dubbed \"Member 1\", of the 100-meter-thick Kibish rock formation, near the Omo River. By searching for datable material in that layer, and then dating it using the potassium-argon method, a research team was able to estimate an age for the fossils by association.\nThe date found agrees with findings from genetic studies on modern human populations, which use extrapolation to determine a date for the earliest modern humans.\nIn the same \"Member 1\" sediment layers, were found additional \"Omo I\" bones, animal fossils, and stone tools.\n\"Those who believe that there is widely scattered evidence of 'modern' behavior going back 200,000 years in Africa will be delighted that modern human anatomy also goes back that far,\" according to study co-author John Fleagle, a physical anthropologist at Stony Brook University in New York.\nWhen comparing the two sets of fossils, there is an anatomical difference between them. \"Omo II\" is much more primitive in appearance, while \"Omo I\" more resembles modern anatomy. Their existence in the same location in the same geological timeframe, may change the way scientists believe humans evolved.\nChris Stringer, director of the Human Origins Group at the Natural History Museum in London: \"Given what we see in larger fossil samples from other regions, we may need to accept that African populations showed large [physical-form] variation at this time.\""}

This approach differs from standard motorized robots (such as the famed Asimo), and requires only a small fraction of the energy to achieve the same amount of locomotion. \nThese passive-dynamic robots have sensors that collect information two hundred times every second, constantly sending new instructions to the motors. The sensors also dictate the course of actuators that control tension in the robot's ankles.\nThe robots learn from their experience walking, getting a bit more precise with each step. Effectively, the robot will also learn to walk on different types of terrain, like going from grass to sand. Tedrake comments on this:"}

Before this legislation came into effect, passengers \"bumped\" from a flight could claim between \u20ac150 and \u20ac300.\nThe new rules apply to all scheduled and chartered flights. Previously only scheduled flight operators were obliged to offer compensation in cases of overbooking\u2014 they did not have to extend compensation to travellers affected by flight cancellations. Low cost airlines have criticised the new compensation levels arguing that the compensation paid will exceed the price of the ticket.\nThe effort by the EU is to discourage airlines from deliberately overbooking flights, a practice which has become routine for most major airlines. Overbooking often leads to \"bumping\", where passengers who cannot be guaranteed a seat are moved to a later flight. In future when this happens airlines will have to offer compensation. Additionally, if flights are cancelled or delayed by more than two hours all passengers must be compensated. This will be the case except in \"extraordinary circumstances\", the definition of which may or may not include bad weather, security alerts or strikes.\n\"It's a preposterous piece of legislation, we among all airlines are fighting this,\" Ryanair deputy chief executive, Michael Cawley told BBC radio 4's Today programme. It has also been claimed that the advice may mislead customers by having them believe that they may be entitled to compensation if flights are delayed due to bad weather.\nMarja Quillinan-Meiland, European Commission spokeswoman has said that there are \"grey areas\" but added \"these are not as big as the airlines are making out.\" Disputed cases would be heard by national enforcement bodies which would decide if there is a case to answer. \nEuropean Regions Airline Association (ERAA) director of air transport Andy Clarke said \"we reckon it's going to cost European air passengers \u2013 not the airlines, the airlines have no money, it has to be paid by the passengers \u2013 1.5bn euros, that's over \u00a31bn a year loaded onto European passengers. That's basically a transfer of money from passengers whose journeys are not disrupted to passengers whose journeys are disrupted.\"\nThese extra costs may also lead to carriers cancelling routes to areas that have been identified as problem destinations. \nThe European Low-Fares Association (ELFA) is mounting a legal challenge to the laws. ELFA and International Air Transport Association expect a ruling from the European Court of Justice in fall of 2005, until then airlines have said they will comply with the regulations. "}

He did not specifically address whether mainland citizens should reconsider visiting the numerous mahjong gaming parlors which dot urban centers throughout the country.\n\"The whip that is used to beat wolves should not be used to beat sheep,\" stated Bu Jingfu.\nChina allows a \"social welfare\" , for which citizens can purchase tickets that help to fund social programs. However, this legal form of gambling is mostly favored by lower-income players who don't have the opportunity to travel to the lavish gaming casinos frequented by the wealthier class of businessmen and party officials who can travel across the border on easily obtained one or two-day .\nDespite relatively harsh penalties for those who are caught participating in illegal gambling operations, a number of provinces are well-known for hosting high-stakes gamblers in illegal, underground operations that are run on the mainland under the noses of local authorities. To combat these operations on a national level, the Public Security Ministry has sent 13 \"inspection teams\" to these provinces in an attempt to crack down on these operations.\nOne historian believes that China's government, which in its various forms has tried to stop avid gamblers for thousands of years, will have no better luck with its current campaign, than it has in the past.\n\"It is really hard to get rid of gambling,\" said Guo Shuanglin, a professor of history at People's University in Beijing.\nGuo explained, \"There were strict laws against gambling in almost every dynasty in China. Take the Song Dynasty, for example, when gamblers were sentenced to death. In the Ming Dynasty, gamblers' hands were chopped off. Even in the period of the Republic of China, they had a very strict anti-gambling law.\"\nAs far away as , casino operators are seeing a shift in for their most elite players, called \"whales\", who are known to bet upwards of US$50,000 a hand. Since the 1980s, Las Vegas has seen a shift from Japanese businessmen to Chinese players, who now make up over 50% of the high-end clientele at some Las Vegas casinos.\nShen Mingming, a expert on Chinese gambling, is skeptical that China's government can sustain a long-term campaign against gambling.\n\"It means long hours for the police, and it cannot be sustained,\" he said. \"When the campaign is over, these organizations just quietly come back to life. Can you keep doing these campaigns every few months?\"\nHowever, this time China's government has set up a special telephone number, to encourage citizens to turn in government officials who are embezzling government funds for illicit gambling runs.\nChina has recently conducted a series of high-profile arrests of corrupt officials who are caught gambling with public funds, two of whom used tens of millions of dollars to fund their gambling lifestyle.\nThe government has also made one special arrest to show that even high-level officials are not immune to prosecution due to their party position. Cai Haowen, who had been groomed by former Chinese President , was arrested this month on an overnight train in province, while fleeing authorities for embezzling hundreds of thousands of dollars and losing it all while gambling.\nFinally, China is starting to crack down on the easy visa programs which have permitted so much traffic to gambling emporiums outside of mainland government control. The new visa program requires that records be kept of the identity of the visa holder. This new visa requirement has started to have a noticeable effect on some border-town casinos, leaving a number of properties with idle employees and few Chinese customers."}

SGR 1806-20 is only 20 kilometers in diameter, rotates once every 7.5 seconds, and has a mass comparable to our sun.\nNeutron stars are stars which have exhausted their nuclear fuel and collapsed. There are no electrons or atoms in the cores of these massive objects, just neutrons packed tightly together.\nAn article from the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics will be published soon in Nature magazine."}

While 61 deaths have been confirmed, the total number of cases is not known.\nSamples have been taken from 40 patients and sent to laboratories in Kinshasa for analysis. So far, all the victims have been suffering from pneumonic plague, with no cases of bubonic plague detected.\nAll the victims are workers at a diamond mine employing 7,000 people. The mine was re-opened on December 16 last year, and the first cases were reported four days later.\nTeams from M\u00e9decins sans Fronti\u00e8res, WHO, Medair and the Ministry of Health have gone to the region to assess the situation, while a multi-disciplinary team flew to the area yesterday. \nIf access is possible, the team will assist in treatment, surveillance, and in the tracing of people who have possibly been exposed to the disease.\nPneumonic plague is a highly infectious disease which has caused many epidemics and pandemics in history. Pneumonic plague differs from bubonic as it specifically infects the lungs.\nThe infected lungs raise the possibility of person-to-person transmission through respiratory droplets. The incubation period for pneumonic plague is usually between two to four days, but can be as little as a few hours. The initial symptoms of headache, weakness, and coughing with hemoptysis are indistinguishable from other respiratory illnesses. Without diagnosis and treatment the infection can be fatal in one to six days; mortality in untreated cases may be as high as 95%. The disease can be effectively treated with antibiotics.\nIt is primarily a disease of rodents. Human infection most often occurs when a person is bitten by a flea that has previously fed on an infected rodent.\nGlobally, the World Health Organization reports 1,000 to 3,000 human cases of plague every year."}

Within a few years of his arrival, Lincoln fell in love with a local tavern keeper's daughter \u2013 Ann Rutledge. Herndon was surprised to hear about her, but of 24 people Herndon interviewed to who knew Lincoln and Ann at the time, 22 said he courted her. But in August, Rutledge contracted typhoid fever and died.\nFrom then on, Lincoln would resemble the stoic man celebrated today. However, he was not without depression upon the death of his lover. One witness remembered, \"He made a remark one day when it was raining that he could not bear the idea of its raining on her grave.\" Lincoln's exceptional reaction, to the point that many worried that he would commit suicide, had more to do with his own past \u2013 the death of his mother when he was but nine years old.\nLincoln would court again, this time to Mary Todd. After a guilty one year and still no commitment, Lincoln wrote to James Speed, a friend with whom he lived for more than four years, that he was racked with the \"never-absent idea that there is \"one\" still unhappy whom I have contributed to make so. That still kills my soul.\" Upon a hasty marriage, \"the debilitating episodes of 'hypo'\"\u2014as Lincoln called his depressions\u2014\"did not recur,\" and henceforth, Lincoln was known for his resolution, a matter of necessity to actually initiate and carry out the Civil War, and to emancipate the slaves.\nSexuality.\nIn a his book, \"The Intimate World of Abraham Lincoln\" () (published posthumously), published last month, the late psychologist C.A. Tripp asserts that Abraham Lincoln was \"predominately homosexual\". Most historians, however, disagree, pointing out that Tripp is applying 20th century social mores to a 19th century context. They have noted that many men slept in beds together in the 19th century, and that Tripp is wrong when he states that Speed is the only one to whom Lincoln signed letters \"Yours forever\" \u2013 he signed notes to at least a dozen other people this exact way. Historian David Herbert Donald writes, \"I simply cannot believe that, if the early relationship between Joshua Speed and Lincoln had been sexual, the president of the United States would so freely and publicly speak of it.\"\nEarly Politics.\nIn his 20s and 30s, Lincoln was more subversive than people acknowledge. As a member of the Whig Party, he published anonymous letters in local newspapers deriding his party's political opponents, the Democrats. This practice was not uncommon at the time, but Burlingame, a historian who is writing a four-volume biography of Lincoln, has come across more than 200 such letters he believes were penned by Lincoln. During the presidential elections of 1836 and 1840, he accused the Democratic candidate, Martin Van Buren, of supporting black suffrage\u2014what he seemed to suggest as an unforgivable sin.\nHowever, through writing a mockery of the Democratic state auditor, James Shields, for being, \"a fool as well as a liar,\" being challenged to a duel by Shields, and the two men barely being persuaded by their seconds to call it off, \"Lincoln may, for the first time, have understood 'honor' and honorable behavior as all-important, as necessary, as a matter of life and death,\" writes Wilson.\nFour years after his squabble with Shields, Lincoln was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives. However, his 1846 two-year term was uneventful\u2014he passed no bills and his only notable speech criticized the ongoing Mexican War, making him seem disloyal at home. Upon the elections of 1848 he merely went back home and got to work in his law practice. He was incredibly successful \u2013 he probably handled over 5,100 cases over his career \u2013 and earned perhaps twice the money historians previously thought. His supporters made him out a simple backwoods man, but Cullom Davis, professor emeritus at the University of Illinois\u2013Sprinfield, commented that, \"by the mid-1850s, you'd have to say he was enjoying an upper-middle-class lifestyle.\"\nAgain, he was a heroic man who would not only take clients whose cases he philosophically agreed with, Lincoln represented all people across all spectrums \u2013 from murderers to adulterers, farmers to doctors. In 1847, Lincoln even defended a Kentucky slave owner who wanted to keep some slaves in Illinois, where slavery was illegal. Lincoln lost.\nFortunately, Lincoln's large law practice gave him national recognition, and when push came to shove, despite being moralistically human, Lincoln tackled, head-on, the most vexing issue of at least one and one-half decades. The Kansas-Nebraska Act, which created future states such that voters could decide for themselves whether slaves would be allowed in their area, completely undermining the Missouri Compromise, gave Lincoln the inspiration he needed, along with an enduring and haunting image of shackled slaves on the Ohio River, \"like so many fish upon a trot-line.\"\nAnd so Lincoln leapt into the fray, denouncing slavery, although he undoubtedly found its guarantee entwined in the Constitution. Abraham Lincoln, however, would once again show his capacity to rise and meet the challenge; before leaving Illinois for the White House, he told a group of journalists, \"Well, boys, your troubles are over now; mine have just begun.\"\nSources.\n "}

The same sugar chains are present on tooth surfaces. \nThe effect of sugar chains on teeth's resistance to disease is analogous to the effect of \"good\" and \"bad\" cholesterol on blood vessels. \"Good\" sugar chains tend to repel bacteria that cause cavities while \"bad\" allow bacteria to bond to teeth and start the decay process. Unlike cholesterol, however, sugar chain makeup in humans is 100% genetically determined. \nDenny and colleagues have found that the sugar chain makeup in saliva can predict a child's future cavity history to plus or minus one cavity with greater than 98% confidence. \nThe findings suggest that in developed areas of the modern era genes play a more significant role in tooth decay than in former times or third world nations where gross malnutrition and negligent oral hygiene held the greatest impact on dental health.

These rates are also significantly stronger from the period in mid-2004 when the euro was worth more than 40,000 lei. Last week, the leu reached such a high rate against the euro that the National Bank of Romania had to intervene and restore the exchange rate back to around 37,000 lei per euro. The leu's growth also had an impact on global exchange rates, weakening the US dollar worldwide by 1%.\nThe National Bank, however, is hesitant to intervene in the marketplace once again due to the positive effects of the leu's appreciation on importers, who can now get products for lower prices, and for consumers, who now have higher purchasing power for imported goods. Romanians are also pleased that their currency, which has faced long periods of fairly sharp depreciation in the 1990s due to high inflation, is finally picking up again and strengthening against other currencies.\nThe leu's appreciation, however, isn't all positive, because it is putting a great deal of pressure on exporters. Other countries are finding Romanian exports more expensive, and therefore less competitive, due to the leu's appreciation, and this could widen the already large account deficit in the country.\nAnalysts predict, however, that the leu's surge cannot be stopped and it will continue strengthening against the euro, reaching a rate of 34,000 lei for one euro in the next week.\nThe current leu will be replaced in July 2005 with the New Leu (RON), with 10,000 old lei = 1 New Leu. The revaluation is expected to prepare Romania for adoption of the euro in 2012. Starting from next month, all Romanian prices must be shown in both the old currency and the new currency. The National Bank of Romania has said that it expects the exchange rate between the New Leu and the euro to hover at around 3.5 RON = 1 euro when the RON is introduced."}
