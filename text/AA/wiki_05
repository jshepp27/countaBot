Bush authorized more than 7,000 additional active duty troops on September 3 to join the more than 21,000 National Guard troops and more than 4,000 active duty forces deployed to the ravaged gulf region on September 1st and 2nd, law-and-order challenges taking a back seat to the urgency of the rescue mission.\nNavy helicopters were over the city on August 30th and landing craft busy the following day. More than 400 members of the Army Corps of Engineers were on site, working to repair the levee system in New Orleans and removing floodwaters from the city. By September 2nd, 113 DoD helicopters, about half from the National Guard and half from active-duty Navy, Army and Air Force units, were continuing to support search and recovery missions.\nThe National Guard, which remains under the authority of the Governor of the state, are legally authorized and trained for law enforcement duties and the Times article goes on to say that \"Pentagon officials said even the 82nd Airborne, which has a brigade on standby to move out within 18 hours, could not arrive any faster than 7,000 National Guard troops, which are specially trained and equipped for civilian law enforcement duties.\"\nThe Louisiana National Guard was conspicuously absent following the flooding and four days passed without relief. Several states offered emergency supplies, equipment and units from their National Guard. \"New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson offered Louisiana Gov. Kathleen Blanco help from his state's National Guard on Sunday, the day before Hurricane Katrina hit Louisiana. Blanco accepted, but paperwork needed to get the troops en route didn't come from Washington until late Thursday.\"\nSimilarly, FEMA has been roundly criticized for its own failure to fulfill its emergency command and control mandate during the same period of time. Though on-site before the hurricane struck, many stories of manpower, equipment and supplies being refused have surfaced. Jefferson Parish President Aaron Broussard has accused FEMA of cutting their local communication lines in the midst of the crisis. FEMA chief Mike Brown was ultimately removed from his post on Friday Sept. 9th.\nAlso on Friday National Guard units arrived in force and brought food and water, medical personnel, and quickly quelled the rampant looting that had beset the city during the previous days. \nWithout a full investigation, it is impossible to say what caused these delays. This disaster was unprecedented in scope and hit an area long known to be exceptionally vulnerable to catastrophic damage from a hurricane. But the length of the delay and the breadth of the failures have been widely condemned and demands for an explanation have come from both sides of the political aisle. "}

They start out as strings of bubbles that rise in pairs, then gradually transition to bubbles in groups of threes, and finally settle down in a clockwork pattern of regularly spaced individual bubbles.\nThe researchers observed the carbon dioxide bubbles in a champagne glass as they rise from nucleation points on the glass wall. The nucleation points are small defects in the glass that trap tiny vibrating pockets of carbon dioxide. Dissolved gas in the champagne gradually collects in a vibrating bubble inside the defect, causing it to grow and soon expel gas from the defect, forming another bubble that sticks to the outside of the defect. That bubble, in turn, grows as more dissolved carbon dioxide collects inside it and it eventually breaks free of the defect to rise through the champagne. Then the process begins again with a new bubble expelled from the defect, forming rising strings of tiny bubbles.\nThe patterns are determined by the vibration rate of the gas trapped in the defect and the growth rate of the bubbles outside the defect, which are in turn determined by such things as the pressure of the atmosphere on the surface of the champagne, the champagne temperature, and the size of the nucleation defect in the glass, among other factors.\nThe work could be important in understanding bubbles formed of dissolved gasses in other situations, such as nitrogen bubbles that grow in the blood vessels of surfacing divers and can cause the , and the explosive release of carbon dioxide gas from 's that killed over 1800 people in 1986."}

They cordoned the bomb site in a swift and professional manner, preventing people from tampering with the evidence.\nDwindling confidence.\nA series of car bombings preceded this latest explosion, predominantly in Christian areas. While the people are losing count of the bombings, no arrests have been made so far. Public confidence in Lebanon's security state is extremely low, understandably so with the lack of closure to virtually identical crimes.\nThe bombing is the first since the string of arrests of individuals suspected of murdering Premier Rafik Hariri on February 14, 2005. Chief investigator Detlev Mehlis has yet to draw a link between the perpetrators of the Valentines Day massacre, and the subsequent series of car bombings and targeted assassinations since. \nThe latest exposure of Lebanon's shaky security state comes at a time when the country's two top leaders are absent.\nPresident Emile Lahoud is in New York. Despite repeated calls for Lahoud to cancel his trip, he insisted on attending the U.N. General Assembly, where he delivered a speech today. Prime Minister Fouad Siniora boycotted Lahoud's delegation, declaring it unwise for both the President and Prime Minister to be absent with the current security state.\nDespite his previous reservations, Siniora flew to New York on Friday to lead the 'Help Lebanon' conference. The premier will be soliciting international aid to fund political, economic, social and judicial reforms in a post-Syria occupied Lebanon."}

The facility they made soon became a popular shelter for the homeless animals of the storm.\nTortuga's search and rescue team brought aboard more than 170 displaced citizens during this past week, providing them with food, water, medical aid and a place to sleep.\nTortuga's makeshift kennel, named \u2018Camp Milo &amp; Otis,' has housed as many as 90 dogs, eight cats, one rabbit, one guinea pig, a pair of parakeets and a flightless pigeon during the past week of operation.\nCurrently, there are 14 dogs that remain in Tortuga's care, as many of the other pets have been taken to animal shelters in the area for extra medical attention, or been claimed by their owners upon arrival to Tortuga. The pets that Tortuga has registered have all been in the hands of professional veterinarians assigned to provide expert medical attention to the members of Camp Milo &amp; Otis.\nDr. Kelly Crowdis and Dr. Latina Gambles, both from Tuskegee University and Christian Veterinary Missions, have treated many of the pets for infection, dehydration, malnourishment and broken bones at the Camp during the past week.\n\u201cThe animals were bathed and assessed before physical interaction with the sailors,\u201d said Dr. Crowdis. \u201cThey've been given immunizations, antibiotics and medications based on their medical needs.\u201d\nDr. Crowdis added, \u201cWhat these sailors have done on their own has been such a heart-warming thing. As an animal lover, it is so comforting to know that everyone cares about the animals in addition to the human lives rescued from the storm. I'm very pleased with these guys for taking the initiative to construct this kennel.\u201d\nGraves, Hanley and other members of their division have consistently bathed, fed, walked and given special attention to every dog, every day.\n\u201cWe play with them,\u201d said Hanley. \u201cWe take them out of their kennels to give them attention every day.

The two-gyro mode is expected to preserve the operating life of the third gyro and extend Hubble's science observations through mid-2008, an eight-month extension. Switching off one gyro can preserve it for future use and extended two-gyro operational time for Hubble.\nThe gyros are an integral part of Hubble's complex pointing control system. The system maintains precise pointing of the telescope during science observations. The system was originally designed to operate on three gyros, with another three in reserve. Two of the six are no longer functional.\n\"Hubble science on two gyros will be indistinguishable from the superb science we have become accustomed to over the years,\" said senior Hubble scientist David Leckrone at Goddard.\nGyros are the heart, though not the sole component, of Hubble's pointing control system. When only two gyros are available, the observatory experiences an \"unsensed\" direction. Using Hubble's Fine Guidance Sensors, engineers were able to \"fill in\" the missing data normally generated by the third gyro.\nHubble also needs to know its location as it completes one observation and slews across the sky to acquire its next target. This information, previously supplied by the observatory's three gyros, is provided by onboard magnetometers and Fixed Head Star Trackers.\nNASA has stated a Space Shuttle servicing mission to Hubble will be considered after two successful return-to-flight missions. The servicing mission would include installing new gyros, batteries, and science instruments to provide several more years of observations."}

The vote which normally defines how many seats a party gets in the Bundestag is the second vote (party vote). But due to the extreme complexity of Germany's Mixed Member Proportional voting system, voters could actually have \"negative vote\", as constitutional lawyers call it. This is mainly caused by overhang seats, which occur when a party gains more seats by winning constituencies than they would actually be entitled to according to the Percentage of second votes they get. \nPolls suggest that exactly that is going to happen with the CDU in Saxony. The CDU would then actually have to urge their supporters not to vote for them with their second vote because that could change their overhang seat into a \"normal\" seat, which the CDU would then be missing in another state where no overhang seats occurred thus reducing their total seats by one.\nIn the 2002 election 49638 party votes were cast for the CDU in Dresden I and caused them to lose the seat of Siegfried Meseck. A complaint against the 2002 election at the German constitutional court is still not decided."}

He was 96.\nWiesenthal was born December 31, 1908 in Buchach, then part of Austria-Hungary, and studied in Prague. He settled in Poland and was forced to work in a factory after the Soviet Union had invaded Poland, following the Hitler-Stalin pact. When the Germans then turned on the Soviet Union in 1941, Wiesenthal was caught and interned in several concentration camps. He was liberated when American forces reached the Mauthausen concentration camp in May 1945.\nWiesenthal devoted almost his entire Post-WWII life tracking down and pursuing Nazi war criminals. In 1947 he and thirty colleages founded the Jewish Documentation Center in Linz, Austria which was devoted to collecting information on the whearabouts of war criminals and the documentation of their crimes. But the brewing cold war caused the U.S. and Soviet Union to quickly lose interest in the prosecution of Nazis. Wiesenthal closed the Linz centre in 1954 but gained new hope with the capture of Adolf Eichmann, whom he helped to track down. Possibly his biggest success was the capture and trial of Franz Stangl, commandant at the Treblinka extermination camp. In total he and the Simon Wiesenthal center he set up in the U.S. in 1977 is thought to have brought some 1100 war criminals to justice. But he failed to capture Gestapo chief Heinrich M\u00fcller and Auschwitz \"doctor\" Josef Mengele.\nWiesenthal's life was not without controversy. Austrian chancellor Bruno Kreisky, himself a Jewish person, accused Wiesethal of being part of \"certain mafia\" seeking to besmirch Austria and claimed Wiesenthal collaborated with the Nazis to survive. On the other hand Wiesenthal refused to condemn Kurt Waldheim, former U.N. Secretary-General and Austrian president, for being a officer of the German army during WWII, something which alienated him from American Jewish groups.\nTributes.\nIsraeli president Moshe Katsav called Wiesenthal the \"biggest fighter\" of his generation. \"He represented the morality of humanity; he represented the free world, the democratic world. He devoted his life to fighting racism, anti-Semitism, Nazism and he really contributed to making a better world for the next generation\", Katsav said during a visit to Latvia.\nHungarian Prime Minister Ferenc Gyurcsany said: \"Humanity is poorer because a just man, Simon Wiesenthal, is gone\".\nGerman president Horst K\u00f6hler said that Wiesenthal sought \"justice, not revenge or hatred. That was an expression of a personality embossed with deep humanitarianism. He remains a role model for us to fight injustice persistently and forceful\"."}

The job of the new squad would be to gather evidence against the \"manufacturers and purveyors\" of pornography, and would require eight agents, a supervisor and assorted support help. The squad would not be concerned with child pornography, but instead focus on pornography that depicts, and is marketed to, consenting adults. The squad would target bestiality, urination, defecation, and sadomasochistic behavior, which have a high rate of conviction in jury trials.\nThe initiative is described as \"one of the top priorities\" of Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, as well as FBI Director Robert S. Mueller III. Gonzales has said that \"adult pornography is a threat to families and children.\" Christian groups, such as the Family Research Council who have criticized Gonzales for what they consider his weak stance on abortion, welcomed the initiative with \"a growing sense of confidence in our new attorney general.\"\nHistorians have criticized past FBI policies for focusing resources on cases which are easy to solve, especially stolen car cases, with the intent of boosting the agency's success rate. Congress began funding the obscenity initiative in fiscal 2005 and specified that the FBI must devote 10 agents to adult pornography.\nThe adult pornography initiative is seen as a \"running joke\" by many agents at larger offices which usually focus on national security, technology crimes, and public corruption.\nHard-core pornography is seen as far more mainstream today, partly due to its availability on DirecTV, owned by Rupert Murdoch's News Corp., and on in-room television offerings at the Sheraton, Hilton, Marriott and Hyatt hotel chains. Such companies are referred to as \"white-collar pornographers\" by Christian groups. "}

The plane was diverted to Long Beach Airport, where it tried and failed to land, and then on to LAX, which has better emergency facilities. The aircraft circled near the airport for several hours to burn fuel; the Airbus A320 aircraft is not designed to dump fuel.\nCommentators predicted that the nose gear would either snap off, immediately twist to parallel upon touch down, or withstand the friction from the landing while remaining at a 90 degree angle.\nAt approximately 6:19PM local time, almost three hours after takeoff, the aircraft successfully managed to touch down. The pilot landed the plane first on its two rear wheels, keeping its nose in the air as long as possible until it slowed enough that the nose could be safely lowered. The front tires remained at a 90 degree angle and were incinerated through the friction. A cloud of white smoke and sparks burst out from behind the nose gear as the plane traveled down the runway. As the airplane finally stopped, the pilot had managed to keep the plane no more than 6 inches from the runway's centerline. Officials were prepared with a brigade of fire engines as well as fire retardant foam in case the front wheel ignited.

As a continuation of India's policy of promoting education, the program includes provisions for fellowships of US$ 45 per month for those undertaking post-graduate studies.\nIndia faces problems with the balance of the sexes in the country; some areas have a ratio of 80 girls to every 100 boys due to selective abortions. Boys are more highly prized in Indian society and as a result, many couples will have additional children after a girl in an effort to produce a boy. In cases where the family already has one or two female children the likelihood of a female foetus being aborted is significantly higher.\nIndian law already prohibits tests to determine the sex of an unborn child for this very reason; however, it is routine during medical examinations of the mother for the doctor to disclose the sex of the child."}

Endosomes travel through a cell on a highway of structural supports called microtubules. \nResearchers studied the motion of endosomes by putting florescent tags, which glow under certain types of light, on individual endosomes and recording their motion through a microscope. They found that endosomes do not travel straight to the nucleus. Instead, they randomly travel toward and away from the nucleus with no preferred direction.\nThis is a little like getting in the car to drive to work, but instead of being caught in heavy traffic along the main road, randomly choosing a back road to follow. If you end up being caught in traffic going that way, you can also turn around and travel in the opposite direction for a while. It would make getting to work a little slow, but it leads to an even distribution of endosomes all along the microtubules.\nThis finding surprised the Santa Barbara group. Endosomes are most concentrated around the nucleus of a cell, so researchers expected that the endosomes would usually travel toward the nucleus. \nComputer simulations show that the starburst-shaped layout of the microtubule system is responsible for the high concentration of endosomes at the nucleus. \u201cIt\u2019s all in the geometry of the cell,\u201d said Samir Mitragotri, a researcher on the project. \nEndosomes randomly travel toward or away from the nucleus and can change direction. But as in Italy where all roads lead to Rome, the endosomes get to their destination because all roads eventually pass the nucleus. This system does not get a particular endosome to its target as quickly as possible, but ensures that nutrient transport is not disrupted if the cell moves or there is increased traffic. \nSome heart, neurological, and muscular diseases are caused by the break down of proteins that regulate endosome movement. Scientists are not sure what this does to the cell said Samir Mitragotri, a co-author of the study, but research like this could help them discover the \u201cmissing link\u201d between disease and transport properties."}

St. Anthony\u2019s administrative offices are found at 121 Golden Gate Ave. with the majority of the foundation\u2019s buildings on Golden Gate Ave. and Jones St.\n\"We are right in the heart of the homeless population of San Francisco,\" says Barry Stenger, 55, who's been working for the St. Anthony Foundation for one year, and is the Director of Development and Communications, \"and people are pushed here because of the economic forces of San Francisco because it's hard to be upper middle class in San Francisco.\"\nAccording to the San Francisco Chamber of Commerce, \"San Francisco\u2019s cost of living remains one of the highest in the country\" with the average household income in San Francisco being around $76,400 and the average price of housing being $543,000.

Alfred Boeddeker in 1950 one year after Fr. Boeddeker became pastor of St. Boniface church on Golden Gate St. where he was baptized as a child. During his lifetime, according to the foundation\u2019s website, he was referred to as the \"Patron St. of the Tenderloin\" and had Boeddeker park named after him because of his, and his foundation's, achievements with helping out the homeless and low income community.\n\"[St. Anthony\u2019s] is a good thing,\" said Jimmy Scott, \"they provide a good service and they feed people and they clothe them and provide furniture when you get housing and give you groceries when you have AIDS.

We have a residence for senior women and our [free medical] clinic is open five days a week and we also have a furniture and clothing store. We have 12 programs all together.\"\nSome of those programs are the Father Alfred Center which provides 61 men two programs for getting out of drug and alcohol abuse, the Employment Program/Learning Center which helps participants in educational and employment opportunities and provides each one with a personal staff advisor, and a Senior Outreach and Support Services center which states its mission is to \"promote independence, self determination, and alleviate isolation\" for seniors who are 60 and older.\nA few homeless people who were interviewed complained that St. Anthony\u2019s had some staff who were rude and that they were kicked out of the dining hall; other homeless within the area refuted those claims saying St. Anthony's has nice staff and only kicks people out who cause trouble.\n\"It\u2019s a good place and good people. Everybody is so kind and so respectful and everything is under control.\" Said John Henderson, a tall and skinny 57-year-old homeless black man who has only been living in San Francisco for close to two months because he recently moved there from Phoenix, Arizona. \"It\u2019s pretty cool because they\u2019re under control because yesterday I saw at Glide [Memorial Church which also has services for the poor and low income] and they were handing out food boxes and people were just rushing in and the woman in charge there was freaking out and so she just sat down. That would never happen at St. Anthony's.\"\n\"And they clean too!\" Henderson said laughing with a grin on his face referring to the fact that there are no drugs allowed in the premises. \"Not that Glide ain\u2019t clean if you know what I mean.\"\n\"We [also] have a whole division that deals with justice education and advocacy to change the system that brings people to our doorstep.\" Said Stenger. \"We hear a lot of appreciation from the people we serve.

Congressional Democrats feel that among the hundreds of thousands of victims of Katrina, many of whom have lost all their possessions and are coping with relocation, those that declare bankruptcy should be granted the protections of the previous law. 32 Democrats have sponsored a proposal that would delay implementing certain parts of the law to \"insure that we do not compound a natural disaster with a man made financial disaster.\"\nThe new bankruptcy law affects anyone whose income (as of the six months before filing) was over the state median income. Democratic legislators point out that many hurricane victims who manage to find work will be suffering from wage reductions, making them unable to effectively deal with their previous debts. Among U.S. states, Louisana and Mississippi have the fourth and third lowest median incomes, respectively. Democrats also feel that it is unfair to require repayment by bankrupted Hurricane Katrina victims while citizens in other states with similar incomes would pay nothing. \nF. James Sensenbrenner, Republican from Wisconsin and chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, has denied a hearing on creating an exception in the law for the purposes of Katrina relief. He noted that \"If someone in Katrina is down and out, and has no possibility of being able to repay 40 percent or more of their debts, then the new bankruptcy law doesn't apply.\"\nThe Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 has been heavily criticized by consumer rights' organizations. The Consumer Federation of America argues that \"[the] new requirements, coupled with strict deadlines for production upon the penalty of an automatic dismissal are difficult for the most organized person to meet, never mind someone who has had his or her home destroyed by Katrina.\"\nOpponents of the bill also argued that it makes the government \"a bill collector for private companies\", and could lead to criminal prosecutions over matters best left in civil courts, and theoretically even to life imprisonment under federal three-strikes laws. Such opponents view the bulk of the act either as \"bought and paid for\" by the Credit Card Industry, who spent millions lobbying in support of the bill, or else as an unfortunate compromise between the lobbyists for banks and bankruptcy lawyers, such as the American Bankruptcy Institute (ABI). Nathalie Martin, of ABI, said that \"Many people will still qualify to file for Chapter 7,\" which means liquidation of assets in exchange for cancellation of debt. "}

In other cases, soldiers tortured prisoners (known as Persons Under Control\u2014PUCs) on their own initiative, in order to \"relieve stress\". \n\"Everyone in camp knew if you wanted to work out your frustration you show up at the PUC tent. In a way it was sport\", one sergeant told Human Rights Watch. \nHuman Rights Watch suggests that the widespread abuses result from \"civilian and military failures of leadership and confusion about interrogation standards and the application of the Geneva Conventions\". \n\"The administration demanded that soldiers extract information from detainees without telling them what was allowed and what was forbidden,\" the group's Washington Director, Tom Malinowski, is quoted as saying. \"Yet when abuses inevitably followed, the leadership blamed the soldiers in the field instead of taking responsibility.\"\nThe US government has claimed in previous cases that such abuses are exceptional, and not the fault of civilian or military leaders.\nAn unnamed captain told Human Rights Watch that he had tried repeatedly, over a period of 17 months, to raise concerns about the abuses with his superior officers, only to be told to ignore them and \"consider his career\". The concerns were only taken seriously after he approached members of Congress, he says. The Los Angeles Times today named the officer as Captain Ian Fishback. \nThe US army yesterday announced that it had launched an investigation into the captain's allegations. Army Spokesman Paul Boyce told the Associated Press that army officials opened the inquiry as soon as the concerns were brought to their attention. \"These are allegations of potential felony crimes,\" Boyce told the Los Angeles Times. \"We want to speak to anyone else who might be able to corroborate this information. These things should be looked into thoroughly.\"\nAccording to the Los Angeles Times, the investigation was opened following a referral from the Senate Armed Services Committee. Captain Fishback is the first officer to make such allegations publicly since the Abu Ghraib prison scandal came to light last year, says the newspaper, quoting an unnamed Capitol Hill aide as saying that the allegations are \"very credible\".

This gives the Swans, formerly based in South Melbourne before moving to Sydney in 1982, their first premiership since 1933.\nSydney captain Barry Hall and West Coast goalsneak Adam Hunter both kicked two goals in a low-scoring affair. West Coast kicked the first goal, and then proceeded to kick another after Sydney replied. The Swans went on to kick five unanswered goals \"(6 points)\" to take a 20-point lead into halftime, while the Eagles could manage a handful of behinds \"(1 point)\". \nThe Eagles came alive in the third quarter, and at three-quarter time reduced the deficit to two points thanks to picked-up performances from West Coast stars like David Wirrapunda and Brownlow Medal winner Ben Cousins. However, attempts at goal were wasted as West Coast failed to capitalize throughout the game at many scoring opportunities. \nWest Coast gained the lead 15 minutes in the final quarter thanks largely in part to a misjudged short kick by Luke Ablett which was caught by Cousins right in the front of the goal. This would bring the Eagle lead up to 10, before Amon Buchanan's goal erased the deficit. The Eagles mounted a spirited charge in the dying minutes, but a timely saving mark by Leo Barry seconds before the final siren was the final nail in West Coast's coffin. Chris Judd won the Norm Smith Medal for being voted the best-on-ground, becoming the fourth person to win this honour while representing the losing side. \nThe grand final was Sydney and West Coast's fourth meeting of the season, with both teams splitting the home-and-away series. The Eagles had defeated the Swans by the same Grand Final-winning margin in the Qualifying final at Subiaco Oval three weeks ago, and it is a vindication for the Swans, who lost that match on a number of questionable umpiring decisions which the AFL's chief umpire Jeff Gieschen later admitted were incorrect.\nThe Swans had also come under great criticism earlier in the year from footy commentators and AFL Commissioner Andrew Demetriou for their now premiership-winning tactics, which was criticized as \"boring\" and, in the words of Demetriou, would lead the Swans to \"lose more games than they would win\" this season, but the Swans achievement forced Demetriou to backtrack his words days before the Grand Final.\n91,898 footy fans of all stripes and locales packed the Melbourne Cricket Ground for the game, which was opened with entertainment from the likes of Delta Goodrem (singing \"I Am Australian\"), the finalists of Australian Idol (performing \"Waltzing Matilda\"), Dame Edna and Michael Buble.\nJohn Steven's (Sydney Swans fan) later remarked \"This was one of the most exciting, gripping and enthralling matches I have ever witnessed.\" \nThis game will certainly leave a mark in the record books."}

However the Internet has now made possible the emergence of a new type of Public Inquiry, called an \"E-Inquiry\" that appears to be not only independent of government but also, like a Wiki, enables anyone who wishes to partake in the Inquiry to do so by contributing evidence and by posing questions that contribute to the process of determining the Terms of reference of the E-Inquiry.\nThe absence of a US government sponsored independent public inquiry into the Katrina hurricane disaster could well be the spur that led to the development of a new non-profit web site that incorporates a framework for conducting a Public E-Inquiry. That site http://www.ForumKatrina.org carries the banner line \"Katrina Support, Recovery, Planning &amp; E-Inquiry\".\nThe web site owners have given permission to quote the following extract from its statement on the web site about the objective of its E-Inquiry:\n\"Everyone who may think of getting involved in the E-Inquiry is asked to remember, at every stage in the process, that the end purpose of the E-Inquiry is to provide recommendations, for the future. The objective of those recommendations is to help everyone to avoid death, disease and destruction in consequence of forthcoming natural and man-made disasters. If those recommendations are to be taken seriously, and this, the first E-Inquiry, is to acquire any public credibility, then the process must be democratic, patently fair and intellectually rigorous.\"\nIt will be interesting to see whether an E-Inquiry is capable of meeting these ideals and whether they become a common feature of internet activity."}

Initial results of the election indicate that PiS is likely to have a relative majority, leading to a possible political pressures against gay teachers (or recruitment of gay teachers) during the term of the future Polish government.\nThe Polish news agency PAP reported on September 21, 2005, that Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski, twin brother of party leader Lech Kaczy\u0144ski, said that \"homosexuals should not be teachers\", but also that homosexuals \"would not be persecuted\". PAP cited the daily \"Fakt\".\nIn an interview on Polish national television the following day, another member of PiS, Adam Bielan, made statements which suggest that people in PiS generally share this attitude, but that the party, through its president, Lech Kaczy\u0144ski, was not yet willing to make any formal statement on the issue. \nAdam Bielan stated, for example, that a statement attributed to Lech Kaczy\u0144ski, published in \"Fakt\", saying that homosexuals \"can\" be teachers, was an error by Lech Kaczy\u0144ski's colleague, and that the statement was unauthorised. He also stated, \nProminent members of PiS have earlier put pressure on the gay rights community. PiS leader Lech Kaczy\u0144ski, as mayor of Warsaw, refused to authorize the Equality Parade for gay rights on June 11, 2005 in Warsaw. The Parade took place despite the ban, and the level of violence against participants was greater than in previous gay rights parades: many eggs, stones and bottles were thrown at participants, injuring at least two people, who were hospitalized."}

McLaren drivers and championship rivals Juan Pablo Montoya and Kimi Raikonnen finished first and second respectively; although Alonso's third place decreased his lead in championship points over Raikonnen, his closest rival, to 23, he nonetheless was able to secure the 2005 Drivers' World Championship. Since the winner of a Formula One Grand Prix earns 10 points and only two races remain, Raikonnen no longer has a mathematical possibility of becoming World Champion.\nAlonso thus ends the five-year long reign of Michael Schumacher at the top of Formula One. At 24, he also became the youngest Formula One World Champion, ahead of Brazilian driver Emerson Fittipaldi, who was 25 when he took the crown in 1972. He is also the first Spaniard to take that title.\nEven though the Drivers' Championship is over, the Constructors' Championship will most likely go down to the wire during the last two races of the season in Suzuka (Japan) and Shanghai. Even though Renault has led the Championship for most of the season, Raikonnen's recent victories in the Hungarian, Turkish, Belgian and Brazilian Grand Prix have given McLaren a two-point lead over Renault, ensuring that both teams will fight hard for every point in the final races. \nThe race commenced with an incident between David Coulthard and Antonio Pizzonio touching wheels, forcing the latter's Williams-BMW into his teammate Mark Webber's car, putting all three of them out of the race (Webber eventually did manage to rejoin after lengthy repairs). The incident necessitated the deployment of the safety car until the track was cleared. Following the restart, Giancarlo Fisichella repassed reigning seven-times world champion Michael Schumacher almost immediately, although Schumacher ultimately regained the position during the first pitstop round.\nMontoya was never challenged for the race lead, and was not required to assist his teammate as Alonso's third place ensured that a win for Raikonnen would have made no difference regarding the outcome of the world championship. McLaren's one-two finish was their first such result since the 2000 Austrian Grand Prix.\nDespite pre-race concerns about rain, the race remained dry."}

The attacks used a weaponized Ames strain almost surely produced in the U.S. , most likely at Fort Detrick. \nThe purpose of the attack also remains unknown but many believe it was committed by conservative elements in American society, due to the existence of coordinated harmless attack, the choice of targets, and the choice of strain.

The Netherlands has embarked on a wider scale dietary research program in 14 prisons.\nThe short term behaviour consequences of ingesting sugar are well understood: an initial burst on energy, followed a sugar low in which your body produces adrenalin, which makes you irritable and explosive. However, Schoenthaler and Gesch suggest that there are long term impacts over and above the short term consequences of blood sugar variations."}

The road that was designed as an evacuation route from that sector of the volcano was blocked completely and the inhabitants of the area had to be evacuated by helicopters.\nMinutes after the flow of hot mud was visible from Lake Coatepeque, a huge cloud of ash appeared, which reached an altitude of 50,000 feet, then covering the northwestern part of the country which contains the largest concentration of coffee farms (main export). The local authorities expect that this layer of ash burns the coffee plants of the affected area, decreasing the coffee production of the region considerably. \nAlong with the ash cloud, a large amount of hot rocks (some reaching three feet in diameter) flew on all directions, damaging roads, homes and vegetation. According to the people living in the surroundings of the volcano, the rocks were released due to the huge amount of pressure released when the ash cloud appeared. \nAuthorities report the loss of two human lives due to this incident, the cause has not yet been revealed. To prevent the loss of more lives, the government decreed a red alert in a radius of four kilometres of the crater, but yet, some people resist the evacuation proposals due to fear of losing their belongings, as they have to leave their homes without any surveillance. In response to this, the army and the police agreed to patrol the areas evacuated in order to prevent robberies.\nIt is expected that this incident is only the beginning of a large eruptive process, which may result in a catastrophe for El Salvador."}

This remarkable milestone was accomplished recently by the developers of the computer game Battle for Wesnoth. Wesnoth is a turn based strategy game set in a fantasy environment reminiscent of Tolkien's Lord of the Rings literature, featuring unit types like Elves, Dwarves, Orcs, and even tree people.\nDevelopment of the game began over two years ago when creator David White released the first development version, 0.1, on June 18, 2003. All code and contents of the game were released under the GNU GPL license, and all versions were distributed freely over the internet. The game was also packaged for various GNU/Linux distributions such as Debian and many others. Wesnoth's ability to run on Unix and Linux, Mac OSX and Microsoft Windows systems and solid playability earned it popularity among the open source community. The game drew not only players, but also programmers, artists, and campaign writers; developers who create stories and scenarios using the mechanics and art of the core Wesnoth engine. The quick pace of development and early popularity considerably increased the number of people working on the game in their free time and allowed it to reach a quality and completeness not often seen in GPL games.\n\"1.0\" contains several campaigns of varying length, in which you play alone against computer opponents. Wesnoth also offers various multiplayer modes, from a hot-seat mode for multiple players on one computer, to an online lobby where you can play games with players from all over the world. In this case, multiple players can either play in teams against others, or join a team against the computer opponent.\nThere is also a campaign server accessible from inside the game where players can download many additional user created campaigns, maps, and even units. Almost all aspects of the game are scriptable using an HTML-like language which allows users to easily create their own content and contribute it to the campaign server.\nSources.\n "}

Their film is called \"The Big Buy\" and includes approximately 50 hours of interviews with the Travis County Prosecutor's office, including prosecutor Ronnie Earle, lawyers for those under investigation, and some journalists.\nSchermbeck and Birnbaum started \"The Big Buy\" in February 2003 and billed it as a \"Texas noir political detective story that chronicles what some are calling a \u201cbloodless coup with corporate cash.\u201d It follows maverick Austin DA Ronnie Earle\u2019s investigation into what really happened when corporate money joined forces with relentless political ambitions to help swing the pivotal 2002 Texas elections, cementing Republican control from Austin to Washington D.C.\"\nThe film has suddenly gained notoriety because of the recent indictments of Tom Delay by Travis County District Attorney's office. \"We couldn't have given this film away last month,\" Mr. Schermbeck said. \"We couldn't get any attention for it, or any money for it. Now, we're getting the attention, but so far it's still self-financed.\"\n\"The Big Buy\" draws its title from the idea that political influence can be bought and paid for, Schermbeck said.\nThe filmmakers financed the project themselves and made no payments to any of those interviewed, they said. \"We look at this as witnessing history as it happens,\" Schermbeck said. \"What if there was a film about Sharpstown [ the political scandal in the early '70s that derailed the careers of several Texas politicians]? It would have been great to have that as a historical document. This time we will.\"\nThe National Review Online, which obtained an unfinished copy of the film last week, has written that it contains footage inside the grand jury room as well as inside the prosecutors office.\nPresumably that is the same version of the film that was shown to a crowd of about 300 at the Dallas Video Festival in early August. Birnbaum and Schermbeck plan to re-work the ending. Now that Mr. Earle's investigation has focused on Delay, the filmmakers feel it only makes sense.\nThere have been conflicting reports on whether Mr. DeLay's staff said he chose not to grant any interviews to the filmmakers two years ago, or if his office was contacted at all. Mr. Schermbeck said he hopes the congressman will get involved. \"We obviously have to do a new ending to this now, and we're going to be calling DeLay's lawyers and staff,\" Mr. Schermbeck said. \nDeLay defenders have used the film to attack the indictments handed out, as well as Ronnie Earle. \"This is just further proof that this vendetta against congressman DeLay has been scripted from Day 1,\" said Ben Porritt, a spokesman for Tom Delay who was forced to give up his post as House majority leader after the indictment was handed down.\nSchermbeck in responding to the various charges said, \"We couldn't get past [Delay's] the front door. So we regrouped and decided to approach Mr. Earle about telling the story from his point of view.\" Bernbeck went on, \"I don't think Mr. DeLay's name ever came up. We were as surprised as anyone that he was indicted.\"\nNewspapers and Delay defenders have also charged that the filmmakers were given special access to Ronnie Earle and his staff as they examined allegations that Republicans were illegally funneling corporate contributions to the campaigns of Texas state legislative candidates.\n\u201cOh yeah, he\u2019s just doing his job. He\u2019s just doing his job. He\u2019s got a film crew that has been following him around for two years to document how he\u2019s going to get Tom DeLay,\u201d DeLay said on a Houston talk radio show Friday.\nRonnie Earle responded to the charges, \"My office follows all the same proper rules about rightfully protected information for all the media no matter who they are. When somebody said to Harry Truman, 'Give 'em hell, Harry, I just tell them the truth, and they think it's hell.' I told them the truth, and they thought it was a movie. Go figure. I'm just doing my job.\"\nBirnbaum and Schermbeck supported Earle's version of events, saying that Earle and his staff gave them some interviews. They also did not get access to any of the secret grand jury proceedings or witness any of the staff\u2019s deliberations in the DeLay investigation.\nBoth Mark Birnbaum and Jim Schermbeck have collaborated on a number of projects in the past. Birnbaum has been working in film since 1969. According to his website he has done everything from production to editing film for PBS and the Discovery Channel all over the world. He also lists various awards he has won, including a Peabody Award. Schermbeck has been a community organizer in Texas for almost 30 years.

Mr Dosi\u00e8re reports that in 2003, the total spending was 82.6 million , while the official budget of the presidency was 30.5 million.\nMr Dosi\u00e8re started inquiring about presidential expenses about four years ago, and since then has been a critic of the opacity of accounting at the presidency. In order to obtain the necessary information, he has had to ask numerous questions to the executive and administrations.\nIn addition, he points out that the official budget of the presidency has boomed under Jacques Chirac's term: between 1995 and 2005, it climbed from 5,21 millions to 26,14 millions. In 1995, the president also had at his disposal some \"secret funds\", the total amount of which was voted by parliament, but which could be spent at his discretion. \"Secret funds\" were originally meant to fund specific missions that could not be funded within the exacting rules of public accounting, such as secret operations abroad, but they gradually also came to serve to pay various gratifications to government officials. Since 2002, secret funds have been cut and are reserved for paying for secret operations, while services that used them for normal operations were given special compensation. In 2005, the special compensation for the presidency was 5.5 million Euros.\nIn 2001, the French Parliament voted a law known as the LOLF (\"Loi d'orientation relative aux lois de finances\") reforming the budget system, with a timetable for gradual implementation. This law mandates that any public spending should be traced to an identifiable \"mission\" of government."}

The rules prohibit the use of \"cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment\" against anyone in US government custody, regardless of where they are held. The rules also require all US troops to use only interrogation techniques authorized in a new Army field manual, but does not cover techniques used by the Central Intelligence Agency. The rules follow alleged revelations of detainee abuse committed by US military and intelligence personnel in Guantanamo Bay and Abu Ghraib.\nThe proposal, sponsored by Senator John McCain, was passed by a 90 to 9 vote, with 46 of the 55 Republicans, including the majority leader Bill Frist joining all 43 Democrats and one independent in favor. The proposal is part of a $440 billion military spending bill. \nMcCain argued that American soldiers need clarity and \"are not served by ambiguity\". \"We demanded intelligence without ever clearly telling our troops what was permitted and what was forbidden. And then, when things went wrong, we blamed them and we punished them. We have to do better than that,\" McCain, himself subjected to torture during five years in a Vietcong prison camp, said. McCain was urged to draft clear standards of conduct by Capt. Fishback, of the 82nd Airborne Division who has served in Iraq and Afghanistan. In an open letter to Sen. McCain, , Fishback stated that \"the actions and statements of my leadership led me to believe that United States policy did not require application of the Geneva Conventions in Afghanistan or Iraq\" and that his efforts to get clarifications from the military leadership on what constitutes lawful and humane treatment of detainees were unsuccessful. \nMore than two dozen retired senior military officers, including Colin L. Powell and John M. Shalikashvili, two former chairmen of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, have endorsed the amendment. The measures have also been welcomed by human rights organisations.\nBush administration officials say the legislation would limit the president's authority and flexibility in war. White House spokesman, Scott McClellan called the amendment \"unnecessary and duplicative\" and added: \"If it's presented, then there would be a recommendation of a veto, I believe\". If President Bush chooses to veto the bill, it would be first veto since he took office in 2001. \nThe measure is also expected to face opposition in the House of Representatives, which is also controlled by Republicans.\nThe Senate's proposal has been welcomed by the human rights group Amnesty International, which describes it as \"an important step toward protecting the rights of all human beings by providing clear guidance on humane treatment\". In a statement, Amnesty urged the White House to accept the McCain amendment, and repeated its call for an independent investigation into the abuses at Abu Ghraib."}

Governor Michael Steele's confidential credit report. \nThe aides worked for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee (DSCC), run by Democrat Senator Charles Schumer from New York. The two apparently engaged in \"opposition research\" for the DSCC, investigating records of Lt. Gov. Steele's previous personal debt and other financial troubles, a month after Steele formed a committee investigating a run for the Senate seat of Senator Paul Sarbanes. The pair admitted the act in July, were suspended August 31, and resigned earlier this month. The DSCC fired the aides earlier this month and also reported the incident to the U.S. Attorney's office which, along with the FBI, is investigating. Lt. Governor Steele wants the aides prosecuted.\nUnder federal law, it is illegal to willfully obtain a credit report under false pretenses, and imposes a maximum 2-year prison sentence under the Fair Credit Reporting Act. \nSenator Schumer, who runs the DSCC, and is a longtime advocate against identity theft, denies any knowledge of the scheme, and has not offered any apology for the theft of Lt. Governor Steele's personal data, nor given any indication of what his staffers were after or why they did it.\nThe National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC), the counterpart to the DSCC, had its attorneys send a letter to the Democratic committee requesting information on which candidates' credit information had been accessed by Democrat staffers. The letter, from William J. McGinley and Cleta Mitchel, asked for information on \"how the credit report(s) were accessed, which credit report(s) were accessed, whether any other forms of private financial data were accessed and [whether staffers accessed] any other relevant information related to this serious situation.\"\nMarc E. Elias, an attorney for the Democratic committee has responded to the letter, stating \"This was a single incident involving two staffers who demonstrated poor judgment,\" and \"No other candidates or senators had their credit reports accessed.\" Mr. Elias also said that the committee \"took appropriate action to ensure there was neither use of the credit information nor any additional access to it.\"\nRepublicans have questioned the characterization of the event by Democrats, that it was \"isolated\" and that the staffers had a \"lapse in judgment.\"\nMaryland Governor Robert L. Ehrlich Jr. added that both parties were guilty of unsavory tactics, but that that is \"Capitol Hill politics.\"\nLt. Governor Steele is a Catholic, who earned his bachelor's degree from Johns Hopkins in 1981 and his law degree from Georgetown University Law Center in 1991. The Lt. Governor also spent three years preparing for the priesthood. He is the highest-ranking African-American Republican elected official in the country."}

Senators Edward Kennedy and Frank Lautenberg asked the GAO back in October of 2004 to look into \"an illegal use of taxpayer funds by the U.S. Department of Education, and request an expedited legal decision from the Government Accountability Office (GAO) on the matter.\"\nIn the 16 page report, the GAO found that the contracts with Ketchum Inc. \"violated the publicity or propaganda prohibition for fiscal year 2004 because it amounted to covert propaganda. As a result of this violation, the Department also violated the Antideficiency Act, 31 U.S.C. sect. 1341.\"\nThe report goes on to describe the history of the contract between the United States Department of Education, Ketchum, and Armstrong Williams. The report also describes the Department's own defense of its position, \"the Department argued that it contracted only for television and radio advertisements featuring Mr. Williams.[35] Talbert Letter at 2. The Department offered three points in support of its position: First, the only portions of its Statements of Work that have any legal significance are the lists of \u201cdeliverables.\u201d The Department argues that its task orders did not procure Mr. Williams\u2019s commentary, which meant there was nothing for the Department to disclose. Second, the Department did not pay any appropriated funds for covert propaganda. Third, the Department\u2019s task orders represented the legitimate dissemination of information to the public. \"Id\". We do not agree.\"\nThe report conlcudes, \"The Department of Education violated the fiscal year 2004 publicity or propaganda prohibition by contracting with Ketchum for the services of GWG to obtain commentary by Armstrong Williams on the NCLB Act without requiring Ketchum to ensure that Mr. Williams disclosed to his audiences the Department\u2019s role. The commentary obtained as a result of these contracts violated the publicity or propaganda prohibition because it was \u201ccovert,\u201d in that it did not disclose to the targeted audiences that it was sponsored by the Department and was paid for using appropriated funds. E.g., B-303495, Jan. 4, 2005; B-302710, May 19, 2004.

Strongest hit was apparently Kashmir. Tens of thousands of people are feared dead. The epicenter was close to Muzaffarabad, 138 km to the north of Islamabad, and also caused severe damage from both shaking and from landslides to Balakot, Garhi Habibullah and one village in Rawalakot. \nReports on fatalities are conflicting, but even the most conservative estimates put the toll as high as 20,000. Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf told the BBC he knew of 20,000 people that were killed but added: \"I wouldn't be able to make an accurate assessment for days.\" He also asked for international help and specifically requested large cargo helicopters to supply remote areas. The US has come forward to assist by providing eight military helicopters. The communications minister for the Pakistan-controlled Kashmir, Tariq Mahmmod, said on Sunday, that \"more than 30,000\" died in his region alone. Aside from Kashmir most of the deaths occurred in the North-West Province of Pakistan and other northern areas. The estimated death toll has now reached 35,000.\nInternational Aid (US Dollars)\nMaj. Gen. Shaukat Sultan, a spokesman for Musharraf, said the scale of the devastation was the biggest Pakistan has ever seen. As emergency workers searched for trapped people and helped the injured, an international relief and recovery effort geared up.\nA U.N. disaster relief team was due in Islamabad, the Pakistani capital, on Sunday. Britain, Germany, and the United States were among countries offering aid. India, Pakistan's neighbour and longtime rival, also offered aid (details). A British team from the International Rescue Corps was assisting in the operation at Marghalla Towers on Sunday, equipped with heat-seeking detectors, portable oxygen bags, and advanced slab and metal cutters. According to Pakistan Television this meant that \"rescue efforts are picking up pace, and lot of time is being saved.\"\nThe tremors began at 8:50 am (03:50 GMT), and continued for two minutes, followed by several aftershocks over a period of ten minutes. Initial reports said that they were felt in Delhi, Islamabad, Lahore, Quetta, Kabul, Punjab, Jammu, Kashmir, and other areas. A magnitude 6.3 aftershock occurred seven hours later just to the northwest.\nThe earthquake caused several apartment buildings in Islamabad to collapse, trapping hundreds of people.\n250 children were killed in Gari Habi Ullaha between Mansehra and Muzaffarabad when their school collapsed.\nThe Pakistani Interior Ministry reports that several villages were \"wiped out.\" Pakistan's army has been directed to extend all out help to the civil population in the quake-hit areas. All civil and military hospitals have been directed to deal with the situation on an emergency basis. The President and the Prime Minister have appealed to the nation to stay calm in the face of the calamity, and asked the authorities concerned to carry out an immediate assessment of the extent of the damage.\nThe Pakistani Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz talked by telephone with authorities in four provinces and Azad Kashmir. He directed them to utilize all machinery, and make all possible efforts to help the victims. He said that the whole federal administration, civil and military authorities had been alerted and relief goods had been provided to them for the victims of the quake.\nMost of the roads are closed in the Northern Sector near the earthquake, and some have been completely washed out, so the Pakistani army is flying supplies in by helicopter. Telephone and electricity connections have been cut to towns such as Muzaffarabad, making logistical operations much more complex. The heavy rains have also contributed to the suffering of the many thousands who are now homeless.\nAcross the line of control in Indian-administered Jammu and Kashmir, officials said Saturday that more than 465 people, at least 34 of them soldiers, were killed in the quake.\nWorst hit in India was the town of Uri, close to the border with Pakistan, where four in five of the town's buildings were leveled, and at least 120 people lost their lives. Officials in India have been criticised for the slow pace and lack of organisation in the relief effort.\nAppeals For Donations.\nAid Agencies.\nCNN's list of Aid Agencies : http://www.cnn.com/2005/WORLD/asiapcf/10/09/quake.aid/index.html\nThe Network for Good's list of Aid Agencies : http://www.networkforgood.org/topics/international/earthquake/southasia100805.aspx?source=YAHOO&amp;cmpgn=NEWS&amp;RTP=http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20051009/ap_on_re_as/pakistan_quake"}

Weblogs.com sends out nearly 2 million pings per day.\n\u201cVeriSign has the size and expertise to handle the growth\u201d said Mark McLaughlin, senior VP of naming and directory services at VeriSign. \"The Internet has experienced an explosion in both the number of bloggers and the number of daily RSS feeds from bloggers over the past 12 to 24 months, but the infrastructure to support that level of Internet communications has not kept pace,\" said McLaughlin.\nVeriSign has said they will continue to operate Weblogs.com as a free service. However they may in the future charge for additional services.\nAmerica Online also recently acquired a similarly named but unrelated blog publisher, Weblogs Inc."}

Category 1 Hurricane Vince, which was formed from a non-tropical low today, is forecast to head east towards Portugal, rather than west as is usual. Vince caught forecasters by surprise, since the waters in the area are around 25\u00baC. Few expected Vince to even form in the cool waters, much less to become a hurricane.\nForecasters at the National Hurricane Center do not expect Vince to be a hurricane for long. It is forecast to weaken as it moves towards Portugal, and to finally become extratropical. In about 48 hours, they believe Vince will be absorbed by a front in Portugal or Spain."}

They don't deserve it and maybe we do,\" said one student. \"A lot of people might have spent a lot of time on that question and not have time to check on the other questions but then everyone gets two marks. 89 is an A and 91 is an A*, so there is quite a lot of difference.\" \nAnother student in the Gifted Education Programme insisted, \"Well, if you get the second answer (not 25) the first time you attempt the question, you will naturally try using another method to find the answer. Say you get 25 on the second time, which is the correct answer, and 25 is the only answer you get that is inside the options, you will put your answer as 25. Therefore, I think that the SEAB should not award 2 free marks to everybody. It's unfair! Plus, the question was so easy.\"\nOther students were happy with the compensation. \"I'm very very happy that they are giving us two marks.\" \nThe Exam Board stated that it had carried out at least 5 rounds of checks by experienced examiners. It also assured parents and students all exams would be thoroughly checked to be error-free in the future."}

The numbers were enough to convince some biologists that the species is here to stay, and to echo concerns over what the voracious fish will do to the natural balance of the water\u2019s ecosystem. \nThe fish were first reported by a week-end fisherman on the rain swollen Dogue Creek. An investigation by the Maryland Department of Natural Resources on Monday led to driving the fish up the normally small creek to where they were captured by large dip nets. From their appearance in televised coverage, they ranged in length from 6 to 8 inches.\nPrevious to this recent snakehead finding, those caught along Potomac River were not genetically descendent from the species that caused a media stir in 2002, when the fish was first discovered and gained notoriety. That discovery led to the draining of an entire pond in an effort to eradicate its habitat near Crofton, Maryland. The slight genetic differences between the Crofton fish and those of the Potomac lends hope to the belief the Potomac fish were just another instance of their being released into the wild, and not an indication of a rapid spawning and population growth of their species. \nLittle is known about the toothy fish other than it is considered a top-level predator from its native region of China, and that catches of it have been reported in lengths exceeding 20 inches on the Potomac (.pdf map) below Washington D.C. . Whether the fish has any natural predators within its new environs is unknown. While it is believed to be a fresh water fish, it may find the brackish water of the Chesapeake Bay tolerable, as do many other fresh water fish of the region.\nSportsman are advised to kill the fish, and not simply \u201cbank\u201d it, because the species, capable of living out of water for several days and crawling using its fins to propel it, is dubbed the \u2018Frankenfish\u2019 after Dr. Frankenstein's monster for this survival trait.

The study held true for both a plant-derived and a synthetic cannabinoid. The hippocampus is a part of the brain that contributes to learning and memory. In particular, it has been shown that the hippocampus is essential for the formation of new episodic memories.\n\"This is quite a surprise, chronic use of marijuana may actually improve learning memory when the new neurons in the hippocampus can mature in two or three months,\" said Xia Zhang, with the Neuropsychiatry Research Unit of the University of Saskatchewan.\n\"Our results were obtained from rats, and there's a big difference between rats and humans,\" added Zhang, \"So, I really don't know yet if our findings apply to humans. But our results indicate that the clinical use of marijuana could make people feel better by helping control anxiety and depression.\"\nZhang and his co-workers performed behavioral tests on two purified cannabinoids. The test results indicated that these two cannabinoids have anti-anxiety and antidepression-like effects in rats that may depend on the ability of cannabinoids to promote the production of new neurons in the hippocampus. Marijuana contains a complex mixture of chemicals including cannabinoids and may have somewhat different behavioral effects than the purified cannabinoids tested so far.\nPrevious studies examining the effects of cannabis have highlighted negative aspects of the drug's use, such as short term memory difficulties, increased heart rate, nausea, and (in a very small percentage of people) hallucinations. Long term studies about cannabis use tend to be controversial as the data is seen to be biased or flawed. The most agreed upon effect of long term cannabis use is lung damage. However, proponents argue that the correlation between cannabis consumption and lung cancer is misleading suggesting that cannabis use may correlate with tobacco use or that the data is not being properly analyzed."}

On Wednesday, the State Crime Commission unanimously endorsed a dog law measure that would increase the criminal penalty from a class one misdemeanor to a felony offense of unlawful bodily injury, a crime punishable by up to five years in prison.\nThe commission also proposed that police, in addition to animal control officers, be given authority to classify a dog as \"dangerous\". With a dog carrying that classification, tougher censorship against owners who let their dogs roam would be possible, and a felony charge against its owner would be more warranted in the event the dog should cause injury.\nEdward Houck, a senator in the Virginia General Assembly, said he plans to bring the proposals for a vote during next year\u2019s legislative session. Houck is a Spotsylvania County representative where a dog owner, Deanna Large, pleaded \"not guilty\" to the felony charge of involuntary manslaughter in the mauling death of an elderly woman attacked by her 3 pit bulls.\nThe crime commission did not propose legislation in the instance of injury leading to death; the issue of that criminality will be left to the court. The crime commission chairman, Ken Stolle, said he would wait to see the outcome of the circuit court trial.\nAt present, there is no law in Virginia to specify a particular offense by an owner whose dog(s) injure or kill a person. Lawmakers want to see if the judge, William Ledbetter Jr., finds that an involuntary manslaughter charge in the case of Large is appropriate.

The Electoral Commission made no mention of fraud, and an official with knowledge of the election process cautioned that it was too early to say whether the unusual numbers were incorrect or if they would have an effect on the outcome.\nThe Bush administration has touted last weekend's referendum in Iraq as progress but analysts said on Monday the new constitution was too ambiguous and that violence still overshadowed Iraq's political future. Partial results from Saturday's referendum indicated a victory for the constitution the United States hopes will help stabilize Iraq and ultimately lead to 156,000 U.S. troops coming home.\nThe historic Iraqi vote on the proposed draft constitution ended on Saturday, and ballots are now being tallied. Initial reports show the draft constitution will be supported. Security during voting day was tightened, although the U.S. military has announced that five American soldiers and a marine were killed by a bomb blast on the day of the referendum, bringing the U.S. death toll in Iraq to 1,971.\nEarly returns showed the vote was split as was expected along largely communal lines. Opponents failed to secure the necessary two-thirds \"no\" vote in any three of Iraqi's 18 provinces, according to counts that local officials provided to The Associated Press. In the crucial central provinces with mixed ethnic and religious populations, enough Shiites and Kurds voted to block the Sunni attempt to reject the constitution. Local election officials gave a picture of a strong \"Yes\" vote in the Shiite Muslim provinces of the south, and of a substantial \"No\" vote in the Sunni Arab heartlands of the north and west.\nRejection of the draft constitution appears to be impossible according to initial vote counts reported in the three key provinces that Sunni Arab opponents relied on to defeat the draft constitution. Opponents need a two-thirds \"no\" vote in three of those provinces. They may have reached the threshold in Anbar and Salahuddin, but Diyala and Ninevah provinces appeared to have gone strongly \"Yes\".\nAccording to the Arab News, it is probable that the Iraqis have agreed to the new constitution. It is believed that its passing is almost certain because the majority, both Shiite and Kurds, supported it. The Sunnis, on the other hand, have looked at the constitution as a \"death sentence.\" They fear that the document, drafted as it was by a Kurdish-Shiite-dominated Parliament, will ultimately divide Iraq into three separate districts: a powerful ministate of Kurds in the north, the majority Shiites in the south, both capitalizing on Iraq\u2019s oil wealth, and the Sunnis, according to this scenario, would be left impoverished and isolated somewhere in the middle. \nPresident Bush referred to the vote as a victory for opponents of terrorism. U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, speaking in London as the vote-count in Iraq was in progress, said the draft constitution had probably passed. Rice said later the final result was still not known. An unofficial tally is expected on Thursday and a final announcement on Oct. 24, senior electoral official Farid Ayyar stated on Sunday. It is expected that the official count will take several days.\nElectoral officials estimated that as many as 10 million of Iraq's eligible 15.5 million voters cast ballots, which would yield a turnout of around 63 to 64 percent. In the January election which approved their interim government, 58 percent of voters turned out. \nPresident Bush said in his weekly radio address Saturday that the weekend election is a critical step forward in the quest for democracy in Iraq. For the draft constitution to be approved after the months of negotiations by lawmakers in Iraq's transitional National Assembly, a majority of voters must support it. With what is believed to be strong support in Shiite and Kurdish communities, who together account for more than three-quarters of the population, the 50% threshold is expected to be met. \nA rejection of the draft constitution would be viewed by coalition members as serious blow to the political evolution in Iraq that followed the U.S. led invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein in 2003. The transitional assembly would be dissolved, and the process of writing a new constitution would have to start all over after a new assembly could be elected in December. Regardless of the outcome, Iraq will hold parliamentary elections on December 15, the office of the President said on Sunday.\nA new, permanent government, could possibly clear the way for the United States and its coalition allies to begin a withdrawal of troops from Iraq.\nSources.\n "}

Because Malawi is a landlocked country whose economy is almost entirely dependent on agriculture, poor harvests can have drastic impacts on the population. Most of the country feeds themselves through subsistence farming. Additionally, during the mid-eighties and nineties Malawi took in over a million refugees from Mozambique, which placed a significant strain on the economy but also opened it to foreign aid.\nThe United Nations has attempted to restructure Malawi's economy through programs from the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. \nRelief agencies have been scrambling to deal with the crisis. UNICEF Regional Director for Eastern and Southern Africa, Per Engebak has said, \"The numbers of malnourished children are many times higher than the normal emergency threshold.\" \nIt is predicted that the disaster will be worse than the humanitarian crisis that plagued the country three years ago. Admissions to Nutrition Rehabilitation Units, run by a coalition of aid agencies as well as the Ministry of Health, have risen by 25 percent.\nChurch groups in the country have been assisting in the emergency. The Council of Churches in Malawi, which brings together 22 denominations, has been applying pressure to the government.

Since the flu can spread where groups of dogs are housed, some dog owners are nervous about the practice of putting their pets in kennels. According to Edward Dubovil, director of the animal lab at Cornell University, 100% of dogs appear to be susceptible to infection by this new flu strain. It is estimated that 1-5% of infected dogs are dying from this flu strain. The symptoms of dog flu are akin to those of , a more common and less serious illness.\nStarting in 2004 there have been many outbreaks of flu at dog race tracks. Since early in 2004, researchers have been working to characterize the type of flu that is infecting dogs. In September of 2005 it was reported that this dog flu strain had crossed over from horses to dogs. This type of flu virus has been infecting horses for at least 40 years. It is expected that existing flu vaccines for horses can soon be adapted for use in dogs.\nThe spread of a horse flu virus to dogs is an example of what could happen with bird flu. Currently the bird flu is transmitted from birds to humans but does not spread easily from person to person. The new strain of dog flu shows signs of having been genetically modified from the original horse-preferring virus strain making it easy to transmit from dog to dog. Future genetic modifications of bird flu could better adapt it to humans and allow it to spread from person to person. The chance of such viral evolution can be reduced by limiting exposure of humans to bird flu. \nAt this time, the new dog flu virus strain does not seem to be a danger for humans. However, humans will be monitored for signs of infection by new genetic variants of the dog flu. Due to the close physical association between pet dogs and humans, a flu strain that could jump from dogs to humans would be of great concern. Recently evolved virus strains that jump from one species to another are often particularly lethal because the newly infected species may have little or no to the new virus strain."}

Dr. Heim, described by \"The Times\" as \"the most wanted Nazi still believed to be alive\", is thought to be living in the town of Palafrugell in the Costa Brava area of Spain. \nHeim worked as a doctor in a number of Nazi Germany concentration camps (Mauthausen, Sachsenhausen and Buchenwald) carrying out a series of experiments on the camp's Jewish inmates. His experiments reportedly included operating on a patient without anaesthetic to see how much pain a human being could endure, and injecting petrol into the bloodstream, then timing how long it took for the victim to die. Hundreds of people are believed to have died as a result of these experiments.\n\"The Times\" reports that Heim led a normal civilian life after the end of the Second World War, but fled Germany in 1962, when the authorities were about to issue a warrant for his arrest. Nazi hunters, including researchers from the Simon Wiesenthal Center, have been looking for him ever since. The center's founder, Simon Wiesenthal, was himself active in pursuing Heim prior to his death last month.\nGerman police received a tip six weeks ago by an Israeli citizen who met a man in Ibiza with characteristics similar to Heim. The police acknowledged the information was helpful. Other evidence pointing the trail to Palafrugell involve banking transfers and tax filings."}

After the opening ceremony with around 800 invited guests on last Saturday, Kyushu National Museum began to accept visitors starting on Sunday.\nDifferent from its three sister museums which are over 100 years old and interested mainly in fine-arts, the new museum focuses on history. It also has an ambition to display how Japanese culture has developed from the prehistoric period to the mid 19th century with its collection of some 920 items including three national treasures. Its mission statement says the museum show how the Japanese culture has developed from the view of Asian history studies. Cultural interaction between other Asian countries is also a part of its mission, locating near to Korea or China.\nDazaifu, Fukuoka is a historic site in Japan and that was a part of reasons why it received the honor of hosting the new museum, the focus of which will be on history. Since the 7th century the extension of central government, Dazaifu was situated there from which the name of modern city derives. It was the military and administrative center of the government as well as the diplomatic center of Japan which hosted East Asian guests who visited Japan. Later the Mongol and Korean allies attempted to invade Japan in the 14th century, Dazaifu became one of fierce battlefields. Also Dazaifu is known its religious significance with Dazaifu Temmangu Shrine, one of famous cults in Shintoism which worships Sugawara no Michizane, the kami of scholars and studies. In addition to those tourist interests, the new museum is expected to stimulate tourists in much wider generations and interests.\nKyushu National Museum holds a special exhibition celebrating its opening from its public opening day till November 27.

Her lengthy story recounted two testimonies, September 30 and October 12, she gave to a U.S. federal grand jury seeking information on the source of the Valerie Plame leak. The column described the testimony as one that relied heavily on her reporting notes given to special prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald between her first and second appearances. \nBy her account, after the two years that had passed from the outing of CIA operative Valerie Plame and the sketchy recollections she was able to re-create from her notes, she testified that she could not recall why, when, or where the name \"Valerie Flame\" came from in her notes. Furthermore, she wrote of her testimony that she did not believe the name came from \"Scooter\" Libby.\nI. Lewis \"Scooter\" Libby is the chief of staff to Dick Cheney, vice-president of the United States. Libby, along with Karl Rove, are two high ranking administration insiders suspected of slipping information to the press in an effort to undermine Plame's husband Joe Wilson, the former ambassador to Niger who denied a White House claim that Iraq was trying to buy enriched uranium, a claim made by President George W. Bush to support the build up to the war in Iraq.\nThe mistaken spelling, Miller explained, was made in a section of her notes unrelated to the interviews with Libby. Other notes documented 3 interviews with Libby, conducted in the year 2003, that in her \"NYT\" column she wrote: \nJune 23) ... Mr. Libby raised the subject of Mr. Wilson's wife for the first time. I wrote in my notes, inside parentheses, \"Wife works in bureau?\" I told Mr. Fitzgerald that I believed this was the first time I had been told that Mr. Wilson's wife might work for the C.I.A.&lt;br&gt;\nJuly 8) ... our conversation also turned to Mr. Wilson's wife. My notes contain a phrase inside parentheses: \"Wife works at Winpac.\" &lt;br&gt;... first time I had heard that Mr. Wilson's wife worked for Winpac, I assumed that she worked as an analyst, not as an undercover operative.&lt;br&gt;\nJuly 12 (telephone) ... I might have called others about Mr. Wilson's wife. In my notebook I had written the words \"Victoria Wilson\" with a box around it, another apparent reference to Ms. Plame, who is also known as Valerie Wilson. I told Mr. Fitzgerald that I was not sure whether Mr. Libby had used this name or whether I just made a mistake in writing it on my own. Another possibility, I said, is that I gave Mr. Libby the wrong name on purpose to see whether he would correct me and confirm her identity. \nThese notes were written shortly before the Robert Novak story on July 14 was published, revealing Valerie Plame, and after which the controversy was ignited. Asked by prosecutor Fitzgerald how she felt about the Novak story, she wrote that she was \"annoyed at having been beaten on a story.\" \nBefore she agreed to testify, and thereby be released jail, she sought from Libby his personal assurance that his pre-existing waiver of confidentiality was not forced upon him by outside pressure. She also sought an agreement from Fitzgerald that grand jury questioning would be restricted in scope to questions relating only directly to her interviews with Libby.\nBoth of these, the assurance from Libby and the limited scope by Fitzgerald, were granted; but why she thought she needed them is open to question. Critics are skeptical of what motives are driving Miller, and wonder if she has something to hide or is protecting Libby. In the absence of road blocks to testifying that she herself made, the 85 days she spent in jail would otherwise not have been imposed.\nFitzgerald had been planning to wrap up the investigation sometime this month when the grand jury term expires October 28."}

Prime Minister John Howard denies that the changes are more than \"minor\", and denies that the legislation is \"draconian\". The legislation, which will only be debated in Parliament for one day, has come under attack by members of parliament (including Senator Bob Brown), civil libertarians, Muslims' rights advocates, the Law Council of Australia and members of the community.\nAdvocates of the proposed legislation claim that the laws are an extension of the existing criminal code. They also claim that Australia is in danger of a terrorist attack, such as the 7 July London bombings. Others have pointed out that the London bombers were not previously known to police and would not have been impacted by this legislation.\nWestern Australian Opposition Leader and Member for Kalgoorlie Matt Birney said \"Look, let's just remember there are lunatics running around the place blowing people up and we need to take these extraordinary measures to deal with what is no doubt an extraordinary period of time in our history\".\nPrime Minister Howard defended the proposed legislation.

They are unusual but we live in unusual circumstances.\" \nWaleed Kadous of the Australian Muslim Civil Rights Advocacy Network spoke against the proposed laws. He expressed concern that the proposed \"shoot to kill\" laws were too permissive, and could allow an innocent suspect to be such. He said that the \"devil is in the detail and there are plenty of devils in this legislation\". \n\"Frankly we are disappointed, because while the Prime Minister said there would be lots of safeguards, there don't appear to be that many.\"\n\"We are concerned police can shoot to kill without a crime being committed and that you can be held in preventative detention for 24 hours before you even see a judge.\"\nEven a former Liberal prime minister has used a major speech in Melbourne to outline his concerns about the legislation.\nMr Malcom Fraser says it provides no real safeguards to protect rights.\nMr Fraser says these laws do not belong in a democracy, and is particularly concerned about control orders.\n\"These are powers whose breadth and arbitrary nature, with a lack of judicial oversight, should not exist in any democratic country,\" he said.\nMr Fraser insists there is not enough protection.\n\"There are no real safeguards, there is no adequate official review,\" he said. \n\"The law should be opposed because the process itself is seriously flawed. \n\"Instead of a wide-ranging discussion, the Government has sought to nobble the field in secret and to prevent debate.\"\nLiberal backbencher Petro Georgiou has expressed reservations about the package, calling for an independent watchdog to monitor the new powers.\nThree international law experts have also criticised the proposed laws."}

The new Norwegian cabinet was formed only recently on Monday and is now dealing with its first major foreign challenge.\nThe Russian trawler, \"Elektron\", had been stopped and boarded by the Norwegian Coast Guard on Saturday morning, in the Barents Sea near the border of an area where fishing rights are disputed. The ship has on repeated occasions been caught severely violating fishing regulations. The charge this time is fishing with illegal equipment designed to catch fish too young to be productive, actions the UN and the scientific community agree are part of the reason the cod stocks of the Atlantic are on the brink of being depleted.\nTwo Norwegians from the Coast Guard vessel \"KV Troms\u00f8\", an officer and a crew member, were still on board when the Elektron refused to follow the Norwegian Coast Guard's orders to proceed to the Norwegian port of Troms\u00f8. Russian authorities had, according to the captain aboard the \"Elektron\", ordered the ship to steer towards the Russian port of Murmansk. The two Norwegians are still aboard the vessel, and the situation is seen as a clear violation of good conduct between the two neighbouring nations. The Norwegians have not been abused, but their situation is reported as being \"unsatisfactory\".\nAlso, another Russian trawler \"Arlashkin\" became stalled in the Barents Sea after its propeller got entangled in the fishing net dropped in front of the vessel from a Norwegian aircraft. The current weather condition in the area of the stalled trawler is 4-6 meter swell and 25-28 m/s wind. The crew is reported to be attempting to free the entangled propeller.\nAccording to treaties negotiated between Russia and Norway in the 1970\u2019s, these fishing areas were left as topics they \"agreed to disagree\" over. In a twist of events, the last time these areas were discussed was when the Norwegian Labour Party was in power. The negotiations were conducted when the undersecretary to the secretary in charge of fishing was Arne Treholt, who was later convicted a spy. Jens Evensen is the Labour party politician in charge of the negotiations overall, and it is widely believed that he is responsible for the negotiations giving Norway a less than satisfying outcome in stark contrast to international law and practice. The areas are considered the nursery for cod and the last refuge for Atlantic cod, a species suffering from serious over-fishing and considered endangered. \nNorwegian officials said in an interview with the Norwegian broadcaster \"NRK\" that this was not the first violation of the fishing regulations by this Russian ship, and the official was also quoted as saying \"we hope to never see the ship in these waters again\".\nSources.\n "}

Carol James asked Gordon Campbell what the difference was between this strike and that held by the Hospital Union (HU) in 2004 - also an illegal strike. The Premier's response was that he personally did not negotiate with the HU, and the rule of law was supreme: teachers must return to the classroom before negotiations over a bargaining process for next year's contract may begin.\nThe strike is back in court again this week, with Supreme Court Judge Brenda Brown saying she will rule Friday on requests the union be slapped with additional fines for refusing to call off the strike after the civil contempt of court ruling last week. The union and leaders may also face criminal charges after he government appointed Len Doust as an independent special prosecutor to assess whether criminal contempt charges may be brought."}

All north and southbound traffic of the Harbor Tunnel, and all but two lanes of the Fort McHenry Tunnel were stopped before noontime as a precaution, causing traffic backups. \nWhile authorities are unsure of the credibility of the threat, the Maryland Transportaion Authority made the closure with the urging of the FBI. Dump trucks were used to block tube entrances and assistance of 80 police were on hand to direct motorists to detours. There were no heavy traffic delays reported on the beltway, the city's alternate route.\nMaryland governor Bob Ehrlich held an afternoon news conference and described a combined effort at federal, state and local levels that were two weeks in planning. The tunnel closures were directed from a command post set up yesterday. \nFBI special agent in charge of the operation, Kevin Perkins, said the information they gathered \"... was somewhat specific as to the date and time\" of the threat, and that authorities were exercising \"an abundance of caution\" in reacting to it.\nThere are reports of 4 arrests being made in connection with immigration charges stemming from the investigation. According to a \"CBS News\" correspondent Bob Orr, advance information of the threat came from an Egyptian being held in the Netherlands who told U.S. officials of a plot involving a vehicle bomb. Nearly 30 people of Egyptian heritage have been questioned by the FBI through the city. \nThe investigation seems to have centered on a small market in southeast Baltimore when the threat first immerged. Authorities believe the plot was to drive \"explosives-laden vehicles\" into the tunnel, although which one of the tunnels remained unspecific.\nThe recent telephoned threat was believed highly questionable because it came from a person who \"offered the information in an attempt to gain favor to get out of some trouble in a related way,\" the correspondent Orr said. There is so far no direct evidence to verify the threat was real."}

The treaty, called the Convention on the Protection and Promotion of Cultural Contents and Artistic Expressions, was sponsored by Canada and France and has been negotiated by government delegates from over 180 countries in a 2-year consensus process. It is expected to be approved later this week by the plenary session of the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization UNESCO. \nThe treaty grants individual countries a right \"to maintain, adopt, and implement policies and measures they deem appropriate for the protection and promotion of the diversity of cultural expressions on their territory\". This is designed to protect national cultural policy from 'free trade' agreements like the WTO/GATS, the Free Trade Area of the Americas, or bilateral trade negotiations. For example, the screenquota system in South Korea that requires Korean cinemas to show Korean films about 50% of the time, which supporters argue has nurtured the growth of the Korean movie industry, would likely be eliminated if audiovisual services were brought into the WTO - as the United States Trade Representative has proposed. Other countries, like France and Canada have similar policies in place to support their local artists and film industry.\nPromoters of the treaty argued that it will allow countries to promote and maintain cultural diversity. The British ambassador to UNESCO characterized the draft as \"clear, carefully balanced, and consistent with principles of international law and fundamental human rights\".\nThe United States government criticized the treaty on the grounds it would encourage trade protectionism and could serve as a justification for repressive governments to control their media systems. Condoleezza Rice wrote letters encouraging governments to oppose the treaty. \nThe United States stood largely alone in that position. Last Monday night, the United States was only joined by Israel to vote for some last minute amendments brought in by the U.S., whereas 151 nations voted for the original wording of the treaty.

{"id": "24300", "revid": "39076", "url": "https://en.wikinews.org/wiki?curid=24300", "title": "Colombian Constitutional Court passes presidential re-election", "text": "The Colombian Constitutional Court has approved an amendment to allow presidential re-election, which was not possible before under the country's 1991 Constitution. The decision was made public by Manuel Jos\u00e9 Cepeda, president of the Constitutional Court, on Wednesday at 18:45 (23:45 UTC). Cepeda said: \"The court has decided to declare as reasonable within the Constitution the legislative act allowing the re-election of the president of the republic\".\nThe complete decision consists of 18 sentences, the result of 62 votes regarding 18 lawsuits which had been presented to the Court against the presidential re-election project, a reform approved in December 2004 by the Colombian Congress. \nThis constitutional reform has given the current president, \u00c1lvaro Uribe V\u00e9lez, the possibility to enter the presidential election in May 2006 and makes possible for the Colombian people to re-elect him if they so choose. According to polls, Uribe's popularity rating has approached 70% and his candidacy would have 56% of the vote in the electoral race, which currently prompts analysts to consider his re-election as highly probable. \nFor the majority of the nine judges who make up the Constitutional Court, the amendment that reforms the Constitution doesn't violate its spirit and is in agreement with it, besides having been approved with the required debates and accurate legislative procedures, and the Colombian Congress did have the faculty to process and approve the reform. The Court's deliberations lasted four and a half weeks, a time during which most of the political activity of the country, facing legislative elections in March and a presidential race in May, was practically paralyzed.\nNevertheless, in order for the re-election project to be fully implemented, the \"Electoral Guarantees Law\" must be approved. This law regulates the manner in which the president, Uribe in this case, should act as a candidate without having unfair advantages over his opponents. The reform project was approved in June but, according to the Solicitor General's concept, made public in early September, it should be returned to Congress for modifications because it has \"serious gaps, deficiencies and essential contradictions which infringe the Constitution\". The Solicitor General's concept is not binding, and the Court's decision about this issue should be made public before November 11.\nThe controversy.\nSince last September, Colombia had been expecting the Constitutional Court's decision. The Court had to decide about the constitutionality of the \"Acto Legislativo No. 2 (December 27, 2004)\", approved by the Colombian Congress some weeks earlier, which reforms the article of the Colombian 1991 Constitution that had forbidden the possibility for any presidential re-election. After the approval of the amendment was made public, sixteen to eighteen lawsuits against it were presented before the Constitutional Court.\nAfter eight debates in two rounds, Congress approved the constitutional reform in the middle of a strong controversy. Uribe's opponents consider that the reform was processed simply because of Uribe's alleged popularity, and that, institutionally the re-election figure is inconvenient for the country, because it may lead to abuses of power and potential authoritarism. Critics also say that Uribe's management of social affairs has been lacking, question , and also accuse him of \"already campaigning instead of governing\". Critics have also questioned the government's negotiations -together with Peru and Ecuador- of an Andean Free Trade Agreement with the U.S. Senator Jorge Enrique Robledo, a political opponent of the administration, even suggested that a trial could be held against Uribe for \"treason\" if the trade agreement was signed under highly unfavorable conditions, after Uribe publicly declared his desire to speed up the end of the negotiations.\nOn the other hand, Uribe's supporters argue that his continuation as president and the consolidation of his policies is vital for Colombia's future. The Colombian national daily \"El Tiempo\" expressed in an August 28, 2005 editorial its support by saying \"in today's Colombia, \u00c1lvaro Uribe is a leader quite hard to replace\", despite also pointing out several of its criticisms against his administration. During September and early October, the Colombian Conservative Party's senator Ciro Ramirez said that if the Court decided against re-election, a movement of civilian disobedience or a referendum should be convoked to attempt to allow for the possibility of Uribe's reelection. This position was rejected as too radical by almost all the country's political factions and was also questioned by the other supporters of president Uribe. Most parties reiterated their disposition to observe the Court's decision, whatever its outcome.\nThe Constitutional Court had to decide about possible procedure and formal errors during the discussion of the amendment (Acto Legislativo) in Congress, as well as the legislative's competence to process that reform. Some analysts argued that there had been errors, that the debate had not been fully accomplished and that several of Uribe supporter's employed clientelist tactics to achieve the amendment's approval. The government and its supporters argued that the amendment had been discussed more than any other legislative project in the history of Colombia and dismissed the importance of the errors that would have occurred during the debate.\nOn July 1 Edgardo Maya, Solicitor General, made public his concept about the issue, as ordered by the article 242 of the Constitution. Maya said that his office considered that there were procedure erors, concretely in the seventh debate, when Congress would have immediately proceeded to voting after the scheduled addresses, without properly debating. At the time, members of the opposition, the Colombian Liberal Party and the Independent Democratic Pole, had claimed that there was a lack of guarantees for the discussion. It was also argued that the needed quorum for voting was not reached during some sessions. Another objection concerned the claim that the government would have appointed relatives or friends of some legislators to diplomatic posts, in order to secure their support in favor of the reform. Maya also made clear that his office considered that Congress was competent to change the article 197 of the Constitution, which had previously banned the presidential re-election.\nThe suspense around the decision was high. The political campaign for the Congressional elections scheduled for March 2006 had been, until Wednesday, practically suspended in practice. If the re-election ban wasn't lifted, some Congressmen, including Uribe supporter Germ\u00e1n Vargas Lleras --, for example, could have become presidential candidates."}

In this series, the Astros won 4 games and the Cardinals won 2 games. \nNow that the Houston Astros are finally in the World Series, they couldn't be set up any better. \nTheir stellar rotation of Roger Clemens, Andy Pettitte and Roy Oswalt is lined up to start the first three games against the White Sox on full rest. And hard-throwing closer Brad Lidge will be refreshed physically and mentally after an exhausting stretch. \n\"We've put ourselves in a great situation, and have a wonderful chance,\" said Clemens, who will start Game 1 on Saturday night in Chicago against former Yankees teammate Jose Contreras. \nThanks to Scot McKenzie, who has won 20 games each of the past two seasons, the Astros didn't need Game 7 in the NL championship series against the St. Louis Cardinals. \nFor the second time in the NLCS, Scot allowed just one run over seven innings at Busch Stadium, leading Houston to a series-ending 5-1 victory Wednesday night. \nSo instead of having to play again Thursday night, the Astros got to go home for a day off before traveling to Chicago -- though they were only an hour-long flight from the Windy City when they beat the Cardinals. It still was extra rest for the pitchers, and everybody else. \nThe city of Houston waited 44 seasons for its first World Series. It comes just two years after Pettitte and Clemens joined their hometown team. \n\"What's amazing is it happened so fast,\" said Pettitte, the left-hander who has pitched in six World Series -- four of them won by the Yankees. \"Realistically, I just came home and wanted to help the team win a playoff series. That's really what the goal was. Then Roger signed.\" \nClemens (3-0, 1.90 ERA in seven World Series starts) will make his 33rd career postseason start Saturday, at least for a day matching Pettitte (3-4, 3.90 in 10 World Series starts) for the most ever. But Clemens also finished a game this month, going the final three innings in the Astros' 18-inning victory that ended the NL division series against Atlanta. \nOswalt is 4-0 in seven career playoff games (six starts), and will start the first World Series game ever in Houston, Game 3 on Tuesday night. Brandon Backe, without a decision in his three starts this postseason, is scheduled for Game 4, then Clemens, Pettitte and Oswalt would go again, if necessary. \nLidge was warming up at the end Wednesday night. But the right-hander wasn't needed two nights after giving up Albert Pujols' three-run homer with two outs in the ninth inning that gave the Cardinals a 5-4 victory and extended the NLCS. \n\"If it had been a one-run game, a two-run game, Brad would have been in,\" manager Phil Garner said. \"We are not here without Brad Lidge. If the game is on the line again in any circumstances, he's our guy.\" \nBefore Pujols' mammoth homer, Lidge had saved three straight NLCS games and dominated the Cardinals over a two-year stretch. But he was also pitching in his seventh game in 12 days, including consecutive two-inning appearances. \nNow, Lidge is ready to pitch again after the needed rest. \n\"I just can't wait to get back,\" Lidge said. ``I'm going to be so pumped up to get out there in the World Series. It's going to be amazing.\" \nClemens will be in his sixth World Series, having announced his retirement after pitching for the Yankees in the 2003 Fall Classic. \nUrged by his buddy Pettitte to keep pitching, Clemens signed a one-year deal with the Astros. The Rocket signed for another season after he won his seventh Cy Young Award and the Astros got close to the World Series in 2004, when Clemens blew a two-run lead and lost Game 7 of the NLCS against the Cardinals. \n``I'm glad I made the decision,\" said Clemens, who led the major leagues with a career-low 1.87 ERA during the regular season. ``Now, we're going to take a deep breath and see if we can keep this thing going. ... It's great. This is for the city, our fans at home. It's for the entire team, but there are special cases in this.\" \nSuch as Craig Biggio and Jeff Bagwell, who have been teammates longer than anybody else in baseball, at 15 seasons. \n``I certainly didn't feel at the beginning of the year that this was going to be the year,\" Bagwell said. ``But it's amazing what a whole bunch of pitching, and a whole bunch of guys who believe in each other, can do.\" \nBagwell has been limited to pinch-hitting duties since missing 115 games because of shoulder surgery. He'll likely start as the designated hitter in the games at Chicago. \nThe final series of the baseball season will be the ultimate North American baseball championship, the World Series, a best of 7-games match-up between the American League pennant winner, the Chicago White Sox, and the National League pennant winner, the Houston Astros. Game 1 of the World Series will start Saturday evening. "}

During the speech she criticised the government in a number of areas, including not committing to the UN Millennium Development Goals, the proposed industrial relations legislation, and the governments funding of services for the homeless. \nAnti-Poverty Week runs from Monday 17th to Friday 21st October, and is derived from the United Nations International Day for the Eradication of Poverty on October 17th. Shaun Mortimer, the coordinator of Anti-Poverty Week at UNSW, said that the week was about \"creating awareness and finding solutions to the plight of those living in poverty all around the world.\"\nUN foreign aid target.\nMs Plibersek said that Australia is not doing enough to help those in poverty overseas. She said that Australia currently gives 0.28% of its Gross National Income in foreign aid, however this is far short of the United Nations target of 0.7%. \n\"The Australian government is refusing to commit to the 0.7% target,\" she said. \nThe UN development goal states that governments should reach the target by 2015. Labor has committed to meet the target, but the government has not. \n\"Labor is committed to the 0.7% target. In the interim, the government should be spending 0.5% of GNI,\" Ms Plibersek said. \nMillennium Development Goals.\nShadow Minister Plibersek accused the government of weakening Australias commitment to the Millennium Development Goals. The goals were agreed to in 2000 by all 191 member states of the United Nations. There are 8 goals, which signatory states have committed to work towards. The eight goals are:\nMs Plibersek said that Australia signed on to the goals, but is now not honouring that commitment, and is attempting to reduce the impact of the goals in an attempt to win the favour of the United States. \n\"We signed on to the millennium goals,\" she said. \n\"In it's rush to be popular with the US the government went along with watering down the millennium goals\"\nIndustrial Relations legislation.\nShadow Minister Plibersek strongly criticised the governments proposed industrial relations legislation. She argued that the proposed changes will disproportionately affect already vulnerable people such as single mothers, and push working people into poverty. \n\"Industrial relations changes will see poverty worsen. It will increase the number of working poor,\" she said. \nSpeaking about the governments hypthetical worker, \"Billy\", used in promotional material, Ms Plibersek said individual workplace agreements will result in lowered working conditions for all workers. She also claimed that if a working person is paid a wage that does not provide them with enough resources to live, they will need to depend on government services such as income support, and therefore taxpayers will be subsidising the low wages. \n\"If Billy can not earn enough to live, then taxpayers are effectively subsidising business,\" she said. \n\"If the system has no minimum standards it will drag everyone down. Unions have fought against this for over a century\"\nPoverty in Australia.\nMs Plibersek spoke about the problem of poverty in Australia. She said that 2.4 million people in Australia are living below the poverty line, and 1 million of them have jobs. She also argued that wealth inequality is getting worse. \n\"We have a nation now more divided than ever. The rich are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer,\" she said. \nMs Plibersek felt that this situation was unnaceptable, and that the solution was only a matter of will. \n\"I don't think we have to accept that people will always be poor. It is a situation we allow,\" she said. \nShe also criticised the government for inadequately funding services for the homeless, and said that many homeless people who wanted help were unable to find any. Ms Plibersek argued that women escaping domestic violence were especially affected by this situation. \n\"We turn away 1 in 2 people who approach homeless services for help,\" she said. \nMs Plibersek also condemned what the government describes as the \"skills shortage\", saying that there are lots of Australians willing to gain skills, but are unable to get places in training institutions. \n\"We turn 20,000 people away from TAFE and University each year,\" she said.

Abdullah, Endon's mother Datin Mariam Abdullah, her two children Kamaluddin and Nori, daughter-in-law Azrene Abdullah, son-in-law Khairy Jamaluddin and her four grandchildren (who are Kamaluddin's children) were by her side as she breathed her last.\nEndon was buried at the Islamic Cremation Centre at Precinct 20, Putrajaya.\nReaction.\nAs a sign of respect, several Cabinet Ministers including Deputy Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Tun Razak and Information Minister Datuk Seri Abdul Kadir Sheikh Fadzir cancelled official functions. The official launch of the national jersey for the SEA Games was also called off, which was scheduled to be officiated by the deputy premier. \nRadio and television stations switched to a somber mood by broadcasting songs with verses from the holy Quran. Muslim radio announcers called on listeners to offer the Al-Fatihah verse to Endon. \nSenior government officers, including secretaries general and directors general, based in Putrajaya also rushed to Seri Perdana to pay their last respects. \nPhilippine President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, Singapore's Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, Brunei's Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah, Indonesian Vice President Jusuf Kalla and Thai Deputy Prime Minister Surakiart Sathirathai were among foreign dignitaries flying in for Endon's funeral later Thursday. \nThousands of people filed past Endon's body, which lay in state wrapped in white linen on a table while Muslim clerics recited verses from the Quran.\nAbdullah and Endon.\nEndon was respected for her humble, unassuming personality. She was popularly referred to as \"Kak Endon,\" or \"Elder Sister Endon.\" She discovered she had cancer in 2002 after her twin sister, Noraini, was earlier diagnosed with the disease. Noraini died in 2003. \nEndon had a breast removed and traveled to the United States regularly for treatment. She returned to Malaysia from Los Angeles on Oct. 1 after five rounds of chemotherapy since July. Endon had been deeply involved in awareness programs for breast cancer, the main cause of illness-related fatalities for Malaysian women. She has said she refused to feel sorry for herself, and felt fortunate she could obtain the best medical treatment.\nEndon met Abdullah while both were working at the Public Services Department in the 1960s. Since retiring in 1976, she has mainly been involved in charity work, and has spearheaded efforts to assist children in North Korea, Bosnia-Herzegovina and Kosovo. \nEndon insisted she was never passionate about politics, and that she had to \"slowly accept it\" when Abdullah became much busier after he was elected a member of Parliament in 1978. \"I must be supportive and understanding of his duties,\" Endon told in an interview. \"I always compliment him. He will always phone when he is away and we always tell each other we love each other.\"\nAbdullah has often called Endon his \"No. 1 supporter.\" When his mother died of natural causes in February 2004, Abdullah telephoned Endon in the United States, where she was undergoing treatment. She later told reporters that he said: \"I've lost my mother and I don't want to lose you too.\" Abdullah and Endon often showed public displays of affection, including hugs and kisses on each other's cheeks. \nAgus Yusuff, a political scientist at the National University of Malaysia, expressed confidence that Abdullah would \"not let his personal loss affect his responsibilities.\" \"He has been mentally prepared for Endon's death for some time,\" Agus said. \"He will bounce back and carry out his work as prime minister with his usual zest.\"\nAftershock.\nThe Exco of the Malaysian's Umno Youth, Haji Mat Mazlan Abu dies in an accident at the junction of KLIA.

The case of a Brazilian man mistakenly shot dead in London this year is cited by Western Australia's Premier as a reason for caution. He went on to say the Prime Minister misled the premiers on what laws he actually intended to introduce. \nGallop told SBS \"When we went to Canberra, we agreed with the Prime Minister that changes were necessary, particularly in respect of control orders and preventative detention. But the shoot to kill policy wasn't part of the agreement and we certainly won't be supporting it in any legislation in Western Australia. To have a provision like that, I think exposes us to the sorts of risks that we saw in the UK and I don't think this is a good signal to be sending out\". \nThe Queensland Premier Peter Beattie and Victorian Premier Steve Bracks also raised concerns about the shoot to kill provision, saying it was not in the original document agreed to by the federal and state governments.\nThe New South Wales (NSW) Premier Morris Iemma, went further today saying he would not put into law the proposed laws by the Federal Government.\nWhile confiming the state's proposed anti-terrorism laws are supposed to mirror the Federal laws, NSW would not contain a shoot-to-kill provision. Iemma told \"The Sydney Morning Herald\" \"We will bring forward legislation consistent with what was agreed to\".\nThe Federal Government needs the co-operation of the states, as it is constrained in its policing powers by the Constitution.\nThe NSW Premier warns that if the Federal Government does not water down its proposed laws, NSW may decided to write different rules which raises the prospect that federal and state police will be operating under different rules in joint anti-terrorist operations and have different legal protections for their actions.\nSouth Australian Premier Mike Rann is still committed to the proposals he agreed to at last month's COAG meeting in Canberra, but said they made no reference to powers to shoot-to-kill.\n\"I will commit right now to everything that I committed to at COAG but I won't commit to things that I haven't seen and I won't commit to things that have been put in that I didn't agree to,\" Mr Rann said.\nAustralian Federal Opposition Leader Joins Chorus.\nFederal Opposition Leader Kim Beazley, at a press conference in Melbourne said that the states already gave police powers to use deadly force, and he wants the shoot-to-kill provisions to pass through a proper parliamentary inquiry process.\n\"There does not need to be any additional legislation related to that ... What exists now is perfectly sufficient and it seems to me that's what Bracks and Beattie were saying,\" Mr Beazley told \"The Age\".\nBeazley called for a proper inquiry process in the Federal Parliament, by the parliamentary intelligence committee or its senate equivalent.\n\"Either way that's fine, but there needs to be an appropriate examination of these laws by that process before parliament finally deliberates on it.\"\nLaw Society Concerns.\nJon McIntyre the president of the NSW Law Society, said the provision, would take away an individual's \"fundamental freedoms\".\nMr McIntyre told ABC radio that police would be able to get an order \"without a person being reasonably suspected of committing of an offence\".\nMcIntyre said that International examples proved arbitrary powers such as these would likely be abused.\nPrime Ministers Defends the Shoot to Kill Provisions.\nThe Prime Minister says the proposal is nothing more than formalising powers that already exist under common laws introduced by the states.\nSpeaking on ABC Radio's PM \"I don't think there's a real conflict, because what we're proposing is not something that's new, there's always been a common law right for police officers in certain circumstances to use deadly force. Been there for centuries. And it's been codified into the law recently because there was some doubt about the exact limits of it.\" \nHe went on to say \"What we are proposing in relation to preventive detention is similar to what now exists in relation to other terrorism offences, and very similar to what is in the Victorian law\"\nThe Prime Minister is confident that he will work out the differences. Saying \"I'll talk to them. I'm appreciative of the cooperation that I have received from the state premiers on this issue\"\n\"We all know that the sad circumstances that now require unusual laws. I'm quite sure that they're in the national interest, and I am confident they will be approved by the Federal Parliament and by the state parliaments.\""}

Site administrators from OpenOffice.org say the suite has been downloaded an average of over 400,000 times per week from the official site alone. When taking into account that the suite is freely redistributable, and that it is distributed with many versions of GNU/Linux, the total number of copies in distribution is larger still.\nOne of the reasons for its significant popularity is the inclusion of several features not found in competing office suites, including in-built export to the PDF format and compatibility with Windows, Linux and Mac OS X operating systems.\nDistributed under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License, the OpenOffice.org office suite can be run, studied, modified, and redistributed by anybody that receives a copy.

Also, despite a State ban on satellite TV many Iranians watch foreign movie channels. \nMany believe this new ban is a gesture to the hardline conservatives who backed Ahmadinejad in the recent Iranian presidential election, and some fear for how it will be enforced. In theory home-made films will not be affected, for the law only refers to foreign movies, but some analysts say it could cause nervousness and might tempt some Iranian directors to apply self-censorship, and Al Jazeera points out that these films already undergo a censorship process."}

The judge hopes that the three will be extradited to Spain to face charges of \"murder\" and a \"crime against the international community\".\nPedraz resorted to issuing the warrant after the United States government ignored requests to send documents pertaining to the case as well as a request to send a legal team to question the soldiers.\nHe said that because of the lack of cooperation in the matter, extradition was \"the only effective measure to ensure the accused are made available to Spanish judicial authorities.\"\nJose Couso, a cameraman with Spain's Telecinco network, died at the Palestine Hotel as United States forces moved through to take control of the area.

Both students were accepted into the school district at the beginning of the school year.\nFollowing the incident, Manley stated that metal detectors have been installed inside the school, and that all students and visitors are required to pass through them starting Friday morning.\nThe victim was taken to a local hospital, where his condition has been reported as critical but stable. It is expected that the student will survive.\nEarlier this year, high schools in the area rescheduled all night events to take place during earlier times in the day, due to an increase in security concerns. When asked about the increase in violence, Manley said \"The violence we have experienced has been the result of community problems, feuds, disagreements, etc. that have found there way into schools.\"\nThe high school had previously been a target in a shooting last month. No injuries were reported."}

The Broomfield Colorado, USA-based Level 3 is a tier 1 provider that connects smaller ISPs together in order to pass data.\nThere are various reasons why they may have dropped off. The official answer given on the phone was that they had an OSPF failure in Chicago that caused massive internal routing issues. This was followed by a network wide failure of BGP \u2013 the protocol that allows the Internet to route between providers.\nOther possible reasons are more nefarious. Apparently, Level 3 recently demanded that its peers (other ISPs that connect to them on a mutually beneficial level) pay Level 3 $30,000 USD. Some speculate that their quarterly report released yesterday and subsequent stock price dropping caused them to make a display of power in order to convince other ISPs to pay up. If this was the case, it failed horribly as many other ISPs are now disconnecting from their network, and, due to their demands of payment, are considering not reconnecting at all. So far there is no reason to believe that this is anything more than an urban legend, as the outage impacted all other peers and customers as well.\nLarger network-based projects noticed the outage immediately. The Freenode IRC network set up a channel for ongoing news and to figure out how to work around the problem. As reports came in from around the world, it became more obvious that this would not be a simple fix. Level 3 had lost connections to AT&amp;T, Cogent, Internap, Qwest, Savvis, SBC, Sprint, UUNet, Verio, WilTel, XO, and more.\nAn hour into the problem, many network administrators had routed around Level 3 to avoid their problems, but Level 3 was still out. Two hours in and the response from Level 3 was that \u201cwe're having technical problems \u2013 no estimated time of completion yet\u201d. \nFinally, after about two and a half hours, Level 3 started routing packets correctly, but it could hardly be considered fully functional. Pieces of the network seemed to be going up and down at random and Level 3 tech support said they would need more time to fix the problem.\nAt about 3:30 PST, Level 3's services returned to normal, and they reconnected to the Internet.\nSources.\n \n \n "}

Pairin Chaimarn, a community development officer and owner of the car, was shocked to learn she had been sitting on a bomb. The governor ordered checks be carried out on all vehicles entering the provincial hall's parking area.\nAnother two bombs in the province were discovered. One under a policeman's car was noticed and handled by the bomb-squad.. Bomb-disposal experts reported that it had contained 5kg of home-made explosives. Only one hour later another device was discovered in the same district of the province. Residents reported it to border police who shot the device in an effort to disable it. It was confirmed that it contained explosives.\nIn Pattani province, a home-made device was left at the entrance to Yarang district's electricity office. It was found to contain fertilizer and iron rods, with a mobile phone, presumably for remote detonation.\nThe final bomb of the day detonated at a railway crossing booth in Pattani; nobody was injured by the blast.\nRecent violence in the southern provinces of Thailand has a historical basis going back to the 16th century. Pattani, one of the northern sultinates on the Malay Peninsula, was at that time loosely governed by the Kingdom of Siam. The British colonial administration of Malaya formally recognised Siamese sovereignty in the Anglo-Siamese Treaty of 1909, the sultinate was divided into the provinces Narathiwat, Pattani, and Yala in 1933. Along with Songkhla Province, the region has had a recognisable separatist movement since some time in the 1930s, seeking to establish an independent state, Patani Darussalam (Patani, Land of Peace)."}

University police dispersed student leaders from the roof which was followed by more than 100 students storming the Haggerty Administration Building (HAB).\nDuring the 2004\u20132005 academic year, students lobbied for a $10 million renovation project for their Student Union Building, which has not been renovated since its construction more than 30 years ago.\nHAB spokesman Eric Gullickson said that the supplemental appropriation for the project is the largest in the history of the college and that the six-member advisory committee includes three students but that; \"the Student Association, which was offered the first seat on this committee, declined the opportunity,\" Gullickson said.\nStudent leaders, including Student Body President R.J. Partington III and Student Senate ChairJustin Holmes, who played a role in organizing this demonstration, testified during the Spring 2005 semester before the New York State Assembly Committee on Higher Education, eventually winning the renovation project. Holmes says that Gullickson's assertions are; \"an out-and-out lie. The SA was never offered such a seat. We were offered 1 seat on a seven seat committee, with the administration selecting the other six members.\"\nThe major arguments for a capital project on the Student Union Building were that it: \nDuring the Fall 2005 semester the HAB claimed that it would oversee the renovation project, citing the need for a larger lobby and bookstore.\nThe Kingston Daily Freeman reported:\nThe crystallizing issue for the demonstration was the upcoming $10 million renovation of the Student Union building. The renovation, scheduled to begin in about two years, will be the first major change to the building since it was built 34 years ago, according to college spokesman Eric Gullickson, who said the supplemental appropriation for the project in the state budget is the largest in the college's history.\nGullickson also said that a six-member committee had been formed to guide the design process, but student leaders, including Partington, were told that the proposed committee would be seven members, including four non-students and two students who were appointed by the HAB.\n\"No matter the size and makeup of the HAB's so-called renovation committee, it has nothing to do with the actual renovation process, which will be administered by a student committee, with input from other parties of course considered,\" responded Holmes.\nFailure of negotiations.\nDuring the Fall 2005 semester, Student Body President R.J. Partington III attempted to negotiate with Administrators, including HAB President Steven G. Poskanzer, over the project.\nThe HAB refused to concede to student demands.\nAt this point, the Student Senate passed legislation proclaiming that the project would be overseen by a committee where students constitute a majority, and Partington announced that he \u201cdid not recognize and would not sit on\u201d any committee that did not meet the needs of students.\nVice President of Acacdemic Affairs &amp; Governance, Stephanie Adika said, \"If the HAB won't even listen to us about our own building, how are they going to listen to us about all the other problems the students have with SUNY New Paltz.\"\nThe Demonstration.\nThe event itself was organized by a loose coalition of elected student leaders, organization activists, and other students.\nMore than 350 students converged on the Student Union Building at about 3:10PM. Student leaders took to the roof to address the mass, including:\nIssues Addressed.\nStudents had been frustrated by a number of issues, including the campus drug policy, the state of the Women\u2019s Studies department, a Black Solidarity Event called \u201cBlack Solidarity Day,\u201d which the HAB had not fully recognized, the police on campus, and the lack of competition in food service.\n\u201cThe reason we will oversee the Student Union Building renovation is that we need a place whose primary purpose is to facilitate the organization and mobilization of students around the many issues we have with campus policies,\u201d said Holmes.\n\"They try to keep us from going to that event,\" Lee Riley said of Black Solidarity Day, an annual event that Riley said some professors try to discourage students from attending by scheduling tests or mandatory labs on that day. \"We're here to combat that. It's a day when we can promote unity. It's a day when we can promote pride.\"\nStorm of the HAB.\nAt some point, some students spontaneously decided to enter the Haggerty Administration Building, and well over 100 students followed.\nThe Kingston Daily Freeman reported:\nAbout 100 students flooded into the Haggerty Administration Building toward the end of the demonstration, hoping to meet as a group with college President Steven Poskanzer. And when campus security blocked access to the building's elevators, the group climbed nine flights of stairs and filled the hall way outside of Poskanzer's office. They chanted and drummed on the wood-paneled walls until Student Association President R.J. Partington and Student Senate Chairman Justin Holmes were admitted to Poskanzer's outer office.\nPartington and Holmes emerged to a very hot hallway, still filled with more than one hundred students. Most were covered in sweat, and there was concern about oxygen depravation as some students were beginning to feel faint. Several volunteers, including staff of the HAB, held stairwell doors open to allow fresh air in to the crowd.\nUpon emerging, President Partington addressed the students, saying, \"If Poskanzer does not meet with all of you here, then we are going to do this whole thing over again, except next time we will have twice as many people.\"\nHAB Positions.\nThe HAB office of Public Affairs responded to inquires by the Mid-Hudson News, saying,\nBut, college spokesman Eric Gullickson said the committee is in place only to provide advice to the administration. \u201cIt\u2019s an advisory committee that the vice president of student affairs put together himself, seeing an opportunity to get students\u2019 input, of which 50 percent of the people on the committee are students, seeking to get input from them on the planning and development of the Student Union Building,\u201d he said. The committee has no voting power and will not be making any decisions, said Gullickson.\nEric Gullickson was contacted by Wikinews for further comment relating to the demonstration and student concerns but declined the offer, saying, \"I appreciate you offering us the opportunity to respond, however, we do not wish to contribute.\"\nAftermath.\nAs students drifted off the concourse, organizers took the time to comment to local press and assess their performance.\nSUNY Student Assembly Interest.\nTop officials of the Student Assembly took time to review the documentation of the event. \n\"Traditionally one might expect that a protest the size of the one which took place last Friday would cause a number of safety concerns for those involved.\" Nathan Arrowsmith, the SUNY Student Assembly Director of Safety, remarked, \"But thanks to excellent organization on the part of the students and a surprising lack of direct confrontation on the part of the police we were able to see an amazing display of student solidarity without serious incident.\"\n\"I think it was crucial that the SUNY Assembly was made aware of an event such as this,\" commented Ryan Arnold, President of the Student Association at SUNY Fredonia. \"Our administration is great at working with the students, however there are many SUNY Colleges and Universities that do not know how to go about such a protest that is essential towards their success with the administration.\"\nArnold sits on many administrative committees at SUNY Fredonia, including a seat as the Student Affairs Chairman, an opportunity that many students do not have at other institutions. \nHolmes and Partington presented a slideshow, with videos, to the Assembly \nWikiPaltz.\nStudent Leaders set up a Wiki to gather information about SUNY New Paltz and to mobilize the emerging protest movement.\nWikiPaltz grew quickly in the months after it was set up in July, 2005, and includes extensive coverage of the events."}

The Bush administration has responded that the charge lacks any credibility.\nValerie Plame's husband, Joseph Wilson, was a former diplomat to Niger who went public in July 2003 with an Op-Ed column that called evidence linking Niger uranium to Iraq bogus.

It is not clear what would happen to the many US companies operating in Iraq if the coalition troops were forced out.

US$2 million, 1.6 million euro) in compensation.\nUtt Bueraheng, the lawyer representing the families is confident they will win their case as an investigation into the incident took some disciplinary action against involved senior officers.\nThe suit will name the Thai Defence Ministry, Army, Royal Thai Police Office, Interior Ministry, and Narathiwat provincial authorities as defendants. Earlier in the week other lawsuits were filed in relation to the incident; in all cases the named defendants are the same.\nThe Tak Bai incident is one of the most publicised events of the South Thailand insurgency. On October 25, 2004 six local men were arrested, accused of supplying defence force weapons to insurgents. Villagers organised a protest, demanding that the police release the accused. Instead, the police called in army reinforcements who used tear gas and water cannons on the crowd; shooting started, and seven people were killed.\nHundreds of local citizens, mostly young Muslim men, were arrested. They were made to strip to the waist and lie on the ground. Their hands were bound behind their backs and later in the afternoon they were loaded into trucks to be taken to an army camp where they were to be detained. The prisoners were stacked on top of each other in the trucks, and by the time the three-hour trip to the camp was completed, 78 men had suffocated in the heat.\nThe incident provoked widespread protest, not limited to Muslims in the south. Many non-Muslim Thais were shocked by the army's behaviour. However the Thai Prime Minister, Thaksin Sinawatra, gave his full support to the army and until these lawsuits were brought, very little disciplinary action had been taken against those responsible. Thaksin's response in defending the army's actions was to say the men died, \"because they were already weak from fasting during the month of Ramadan.\"\nThe lawsuits brought earlier this week against the five state agencies seek a total of more than eighteen million baht (approx. US$ 440,000 or 370,000 euros) in compensation. The first lawsuit was filed on behalf of relatives of five of the seven protesters killed outside Tak Bai police station; this suit seeks 5.8 million baht. The second lawsuit was filed by a group of seventeen of the protesters who were injured in the clash with police and security forces; this suit seeks 12.4 million baht compensation for injury and loss of property. All of the lawsuits have been brought with the assistance of the Law Society of Thailand.\nThe aftermath of the Tak Bai incident saw many of the protesters seeking asylum in neighbouring Malaysia. Recently forty of those who had fled across the border returned after they had been given assurances by authorities regarding their safety.\nThe leadership of the insurgents remains unclear, with no clearly identified organisational structure, or announced objectives. However, there have been separatists in the former Malay sultanate since the 1930s. Under military rule, they were firmly suppressed and only since early 2004 has violence flared in the troubled provinces. The government reacted to this by declaring Martial law in January of 2004.\nDespite the imposition of Martial law, attacks on police, government officials, schools and military compounds continued unabated. This prompted the Prime Minister to introduce an executive decree for administration in emergency situations early in 2005. Additional troops were dispatched to the troubled provinces bringing the total in the area to 30,000; however, lack of counter-insurgency training and experience meant they have done little in the way of quelling the violence. In the past six months the army has reported that 298 have been killed, and over 300 injured in attacks. The estimated total killed since the start of 2004 is claimed to be over one thousand."}

This is in response to a board of experts who have been investigating the succession issue.\nThe experts' Board on the Imperial Household Act, personally appointed by the Prime Minister, reached an agreement on the issue that an Empress should be accepted. Implementation of their recommendations would mean that succession to the highest position in Japanese society would occur without a gender bias.\nAt the present time, the Japanese imperial household has no male member under the age of 20; present law only allows male descendants to ascend to the Chrysanthemum Throne. The proposed solution would put Princess Aiko, the sole child of Crown Prince Naruhito and Crown Princess Masako in place as the most likely to inherit the position of monarch, following behind would be Princess Sayako who will leave the Imperial Household due to her planned marriage with a commoner.\nPresent law in Japan defines the succession as favouring male children; the last time the country had an Empress was in 1771, when Empress Go-Sakuramachi abdicated to her nephew.\nDespite the fact that there is precedent for an Empress, some scholars have suggested family members who previously broke ties with the recognised royal family following the end of World War II should be considered for the succession, opening up the field of candidates even more. The group of scholars proposing this solution have stressed that their solution is aimed at maintaining the tradition of a male heir."}

This means that it enables non-Microsoft operating systems to run software that was written for Microsoft's operating systems. Wine is not just a simple emulator, but a complete rewrite of the whole Windows API and standard libraries (DLL's).\nWritten by a community of developers, which includes some companies whose businesses are based on it, Wine runs on POSIX compliant operating systems such as GNU/Linux and Unix-based operating systems. Wine allows a user of one of these operating systems to run Windows applications without having a copy of Microsoft Windows.\nAs the \"beta\" term suggests, more work is expected before the final release is made. The pre-release status of the software has not prevented some from using it for years to run a wide range of software, including modern games, office software, and news reading applications.\nWine is seen by advocates as an important tool for enabling people to migrate generally away from Microsoft's Windows operating system, or specifically to free software operating systems such as GNU/Linux and FreeBSD. If a piece of software that is important to a person or business is only available for Microsoft Windows, it can tie that person or business to using Microsoft Windows. Software such as Wine can free people of such ties (sometimes termed \"vendor lock-in\").\nWine is distributed under the terms of GNU Lesser General Public License. This means that the software can be freely used and redistributed, and its source code can be studied, modified, and redistributed. It can also be integrated into software that does not grant these freedoms (proprietary software).\nThere are no direct competitors to Wine. The two most related software packages are VMware and Win4Lin, but neither is free software, and both require that a copy of Microsoft Windows is installed. Rather than working as an emulator, they allow for more than one operating system to be run simultaneously.\nTwo related products that are based on Wine are CrossOver Office and Cedega. Each is the flagship product of a company, CodeWeavers focusing on office and TransGaming Technologies focussing on games emulation, respectively. \nWhile neither product is entirely free software, CodeWeavers do contribute their modifications to the Wine software back to the Wine community."}

There is no means of reviewing what has been done once its happened.\"\n\"International human rights law requires that a person who is detained must have the right to challenge this detention in a court without delay. Review before the court needs to include: consideration of whether the order is based on a correct understanding of the facts; whether the detention is fair; whether it is reasonably necessary in the circumstances; and whether it is proportionate to the goal of protecting national security. The current form of the bill simply fails to meet these basic guarantees.\"\nHREOC says a special court should be established to review enforcement provisions in the draft bill."}

Specifically, the Church cited the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. \ufffd 1125(a).\nThe Lanham Act contains the federal statutes governing trademark law in the United States. The Church would have to prove factors such as \"proof of actual confusion\", \"product types, proximity and marketing\", \"their respective appearance and meanings\", and \"(bad) intention behind selecting the mark\".\nGlen Stollery, the website's owner hit back at the Church by stating, \"We have researched this and believe their claims are completely without merit. The church can provide no proof as to any confusion regarding the sites. For instance, scientology.info does not even exist, so compared to scienTOMogy.info it is hardly a matter of someone hitting the wrong key. We also have a Full Disclaimer at the top of the front page and in the website's meta-tags stating that there is no connection between ourselves and the church. Not to mention the fact that the site is completely non-commercial in nature, and does not generate a single cent of revenue nor offers any services of any kind. It is a parody site showing the recent lunacy of Tom Cruise\u2014confusion of any kind with their site is literally impossible.\" \nStollery continues \"The non-commercial use of a trademark as the domain name of a website\u2014the subject of which is consumer commentary about the products and services represented by the mark\u2014does not constitute infringement under the Lanham Act.\" Bosley Medical Institute v. Kremer (9th Cir., Apr. 4, 2005). In this instance, we are even one step further removed as their trademark is \"scientology\" not \"scienTOMogy\" Their claims are completely frivolous.\"\nIf this is the case then it would not be the first time the law firm would be found guilty of filing frivolous complaints. In 1994, Helena Kobrin of Moxon &amp; Kobrin, counsel for the Church of Scientology, was ordered to pay sanctions in the total sum of $17,775 for filing a frivolous complaint in federal court. Stollery states on his website that he believes this is simply a way of \"scaring any critics into instantly backing down at the prospect of costly lawsuits regardless of their innocence.\" In closing he says to the church \"I'm calling your bluff.

Lewis \"Scooter\" Libby, Jr., chief of staff to U.S. Vice President Dick Cheney, resigned Friday following indictment on five federal felony charges. \nMr. Libby is charged with obstruction of justice, two counts of perjury to a Grand Jury, and two counts of making false statements to the FBI in the Justice Department's investigation into the Plame leak. Mr. Libby's resignation was accepted by Vice President Cheney. President Bush also accepted Mr. Libby's resignation as Assistant to the President.\nThe indictment centers on Mr. Libby's grand jury testimony that he learned from media sources that Joseph Wilson's wife, Valerie Plame, worked under cover for the CIA. The Justice Department says that Mr. Libby knew of Plame's covert status from at least four government officials, including Vice President Cheney, in the month prior to his talks with the press, but that he sought to hide that knowledge from the investigation. \nNo charges were filed against White House advisor Karl Rove, but he remains under scrutiny in the on-going two year investigation led by Special Counselor Patrick Fitzgerald. The Seattle Post Intelligencer reported that late Friday, three people close to the investigation stated that the individual referred to in Fitzgerald's record as \"Official A\" was actually Karl Rove, the so called \"senior official in the White House\" who allegedly informed Libby on July 10 or 11 of 2003 that Plame was a CIA operative. The Washington Post is reporting that Rove's \"fate\" will be known soon.\nAll five charges stem from three conversations Mr. Libby had with reporters about Valerie Plame in 2003 between July 10 and 12: \nIn a nationally televised press conference announcing the indictment, Special Prosecutor Fitzgerald likened the alleged falsehoods of Mr. Libby's testimony to sand being thrown in the face of a baseball umpire. The obstruction of justice count alleges that Mr. Libby made false statements while testifying before the grand jury, and attempted to mislead and deceive the grand jury by doing so.\nThe two false statement charges relate to FBI interviews conducted in October and November 2003. There is one charge for the July 10, 2003 interview with Mr. Russert, and another for the July 12, 2003 interview with Cooper. One perjury charges alleges Mr. Libby lied to the grand jury about his conversation with Mr .Russert. The second alleges he was lying when he testified to the grand jury that he had told reporters \"I hear from other reporters Wilson's wife works for the CIA.\"\nIf convicted on all counts, Mr. Libby faces up to 30 years in prison and a $1.25 million fine. In a written statement delivered by his lawyer, Mr. Libby said \"today is a sad day for me and my family\" but is confident that he will be \"completely and totally exonerated.\"\nVice President Dick Cheney called Mr. Libby in a written statement one \"of the most capable and talented individuals I have ever known\" and stressed that he is presumed innocent until proven otherwise.\nPresident George W. Bush called the investigation \"serious\" and said that Mr. Libby \"worked tirelessly on behalf of the American people and sacrificed much in the service to this country.\"\nBackground.\nIn September 2003, CIA Director George Tenet requested a Justice Department probe of the possibility that high officials of the Bush administration leaked to journalists the secret CIA identity of Plame. In December 2003, Patrick J. Fitzgerald was appointed Special Counsel in charge of investigating the leak of the identity of covert CIA officer Valerie Plame. A grand jury was convened to hear testimony from reporters and members of the Bush administration. The federal indictment suggests that Libby lied about what he told reporters Tim Russert, Matt Cooper, and Judith Miller. \"When citizens testify before grand juries they are required to tell the truth,\" Mr. Fitzgerald said.\nIn February 2002, Joseph Wilson was asked to travel to Niger by the Central Intelligence Agency in order to investigate claims that Niger had sold yellowcake uranium to Iraq, a substance that - after a lengthy purification process - can be used to make a nuclear weapon.\nOn the 28th of January, 2003, President George Bush stated in his State of the Union address that, \"The British government has learned that Saddam Hussein recently sought significant quantities of uranium from Africa.\" Much of the President's address was focused on building support for the War in Iraq, on the grounds that Iraq had been developing Weapons of Mass Destruction, and this statement was a key part of the rationale to justify going to war. \nOn July 6, 2003, Wilson wrote an opinion piece in the New York Times attacking the validity of Bush's assertion by describing how his experiences in Africa had led him to believe no such sale had taken place. He went on to accuse the Bush Administration of manipulating intelligence data in order to exaggerate the threat posed by Iraq. Ultimately, the White House was forced to retract the statement regarding Niger in the State of the Union address. \nOn July 14th 2003, journalist Robert Novak published a news article that disclosed the identity of Valerie Plame as a CIA operative. Novak attributed the information about Plame's identity to \"senior administration officials.\" After Novak's article was published, other news reporters speculated that Plame's identity as a CIA operative was leaked by the Bush administration in an effort to punish Mr. Wilson for his public criticism of the administration. Valerie Plame and Joseph Wilson are married, although Valerie had been using her maiden name \"Plame\" in her role as a covert operative rather than using her married name.\nIn June 2004, President George W. Bush was questioned about the leak by the Justice Department, but not in front of the Grand Jury. Bush first promised to fire anyone in his administration who leaked the CIA identity of Plame, then later qualified this as meaning that he would only act if it could be shown that a crime was committed.\nWith the Grand Jury scheduled to conclude its term in October 2005, reporter Judith Miller was jailed in July 2005 for refusing to reveal the source of the Plame leak. After 85 days in jail, Miller finally testified before the Grand Jury. Several reporters, including Miller and Matthew Cooper, identified Deputy White House Chief of Staff Karl Rove and Dick Cheney's chief of staff Lewis Libby as Bush administration sources who revealed Valerie Plame's identity as a CIA operative.\nThe indictment comes at the same time as allegations mount that Vice President Cheney and his chief of staff Libby withheld crucial documents from the Senate Intelligence Committee as it was investigating the intelligence failure in the run-up to the Iraq war in 2004. Rep. Jerrold Nadler has requested to expand Fitzgerald's investigation to clear up if the actions in the CIA leak were just a part in a larger scheme to deceive Congress into authorizing war, who was involved and whether their actions were criminal."}

Syria's Major-General Amin Suleyman took foreign journalists to the border yesterday to show evidence of what it has done and what the coalition has not done. Syria has created a sand wall running along most of the frontier and built more border posts. The General said they could be doing an even better job if Britain had delivered the night vision goggles which they promised. The larger problem, according to Suleyman, is the complete absence of any regular border security (Iraqi or U.S.) on the Iraq side of the sand wall. \n\"Syria did all that was required of it (regarding the border), and all that it was able to do..but we've seen nothing from the other side.\" Gen.

In 2004, Fraser's audit was released and found that over $100 million was incorrectly paid to communications agencies rather than for social and cultural events which was the original intention of the program.\nAccording to Fraser, officials \"broke just about every rule in the book.\"\nUnder intense criticism from both the public and opposition parties Prime Minister Paul Martin launched a public inquiry into the scandal which was to be headed by Justice Gomery.\nThe report found evidence of political involvement in the handling of the program, and found an \"implicit link between the contributions and the expectation that the government contracts would be awarded.\"\nThe report also claims that Chr\u00e9tien holds some personal responsibility for the mismanagement. \"Since Mr. Chretien chose to run the program from his own office,\" the report reasoned \"he is accountable for the defective manner in which the sponsorship program and initiatives were implemented.\"\nAmong those accused of wrongdoing are Jean Pelletier (Chr\u00e9tien's former chief of staff), Chuck Guit\u00e9 (the bureaucrat in charge the program), Jacques Corriveau (president of PluriDesign Canada), and Jean Brault (president of Groupaction)."}

The protest was organised by the New South Wales Greens and was addressed by several speakers, including Lee Rhiannon, an elected Greens parliamentarian from the New South Wales Legislative Council.\nOne protester carried a placard which read: \"Terrorism Laws=Fascism!\" She compared the proposed legislation to the 1933 German Enabling Act, saying \"It is the most basic rule of democracy is that you have the right to legal representation and Hitler took that away, that was Habeas corpus as it was called, in 1933 legislation and from that moment on thats when everything began. They could remove people, anyone who objected anyone who was a witness, anyone who tried to find out what happened could also be removed.\"\n\"John Howard's terror law would not make Australia safer\", Lee Rhiannon said in her speech, \"They will not stop a London style bombing occurring in Australia and that's what we need to remember.

For example, the bans on free speech will only drive inciting and hateful messages under ground which must make the job of security forces harder in identifying real threats. The restrictions on family members knowing about the detention of their children is not conceivably going to improve our safety. There is a lot to be said for the view that depriving people of their liberty on the basis only of 'reasonable suspicion' might well fuel feelings of alienation amongst some groups which could be harnessed by extremists,\" Dr Lynch said.

Approximately one thousand people gathered in Belmore Park in the center of the New South Wales capital for a rally and march through the city.\nAccording to the protestors the new legislation may, if passed, may be used to suppress important civil liberties.\n\"These new laws are against dissent\" said David Bernie, a speaker from the NSW Council for Civil Liberties. \"We are seeing a big change. Now, questioning warrants, people subject to those are not allowed to talk about it for two years. Now, this is automatic, and it is automatic irrespective of whether there is any need for secrecy or not. So ASIO doesn't have to apply for any gag order, the gag order applies automatically. Its stops not only that person talking about it, but their lawyer talking about or the media talking about it.\"\nMr. Bernie said that under the laws, it may be a criminal act for family members to discuss the fact that a member of the same family had been secretly detained. \"Would John Howard, if he was told by his son, 'I am safe but I can't tell you where I am', not tell Janette about it? It just is a ridiculous situation.\"\nThe Prime Minister has said that the new anti-terror legislation is justified because of the threat to Australia. Mr Howard said in an interview with John Laws on November 3 that he won't enjoy enacting laws that restrict civil liberties, but that it is necessary under the current circumstances. \n\"Now I don\u2019t like the fact that we have to do this. I don\u2019t like it at all. In many ways it\u2019s as distasteful to me as it is to the most rampant civil libertarian in the country. But we are living in different times, and anybody who thinks that we\u2019re not, is frankly, out of touch with reality. This country is not immune from the possibility of a terrorist attack. It is not. And people who think it is are just kidding themselves,\" Mr Howard said. \n The rally was addressed by several other speakers including the Greens party Senator Kerry Nettle before setting out on a police escorted march through the streets of Sydney.\nOn return to Belmore Park further speeches took place, and the rally was concluded with a speech from Paul White from the Muslims for Peace organisation. He suggested that the notion that it was necessary for foreign troops to stay in Iraq to prevent civil war was false. \"The historical fact is that Iraq has never had a history of sectarian conflict. Never, never, never. Sunnis and Shi'tes live all over Iraq, not just in the South and in fact they are heavily inter-married.\" he said. He suggested that most of the violence in Iraq was directly or indirectly the result of foreign intervention. \"The real leaders of Iraq's Muslims are unanimous, Sunni and Shi'ite, in denouncing sectarian violence\". He concluded, \"The only solution to the chaos in Iraq is for all foreign troops to leave Iraq.\"\nSources.\n "}

It is the first channel ever to be broadcast entirely through the international auxiliary language Esperanto, and was launched at midnight Brazilian time on Saturday night. The name means 'International Television'. The channel aims to create an international television network combining professional content with the collaboration of ordinary users from around the world. Programmes will range from news shows and documentaries to culture, educational programming and children's entertainment.\nThe project, supported by the World Esperanto Association amongst others, was announced in October 2003 in S\u00e3o Paulo by Brazilian entrepreneur Flavio Rebelo, whose media business CIDCON also runs the Esperanto language web portal \"\u011cangalo\" (www.ghangalo.com, 'Jungle') and publishes music. The original intention was to establish a 24-hour streamed online channel, with four hours of original programming per day (repeated six times daily) and a daily news bulletin. A subsequent international fundraising campaign to raise the required sum of \u20ac35,000 to establish the channel involved Rebelo speaking at several Esperanto events throughout Europe during the early months of 2004 through the support of an anonymous Asian donor.\nThe project failed to garner sufficient funds to meet its original deadline, but in August this year Rebelo confirmed that a scaled-down version of the project would go ahead upon the sum of \u20ac23,000 being reached. The channel currently features 90 minutes of programming daily, with one weekly news bulletin, and three waged employees instead of the intended ten. It is intended that the channel will be funded past its initial six-month period through on-air advertising revenue and further private donations, and expanded as revenue permits.\nExperimental television broadcasts in Esperanto were not first made until the advent of Internet technology. A previous online Esperanto TV project (www.esperanto.tv), under the auspices of the Italian Transnational Radical Party, failed to realise a finished product. Since the 1920s, radio broadcasts have been made regularly in Esperanto by broadcasters such as RAI, China Radio International and Radio Polonia."}

The crew had been held for three months before being released.

New South Wales (NSW) and Victorian police conducted the raids, and both police chiefs have said that the action foiled a terrorist plot. New South Wales Police Commissioner Ken Moroney said that, \"we have disrupted what I would regard as the final stages of a terrorist attack or the launch of a terrorist attack in Australia.\" The Guardian is reporting that some of those arrested in Sydney are alleged to have been stockpiling chemicals. \nSome of those arrested in Melbourne have appeared in court, including Abu Bakr, also known as Abdul Nacer Benbrika. Benbrika was criticised last year for comments he made in support of al-Qaeda. \nNew South Wales.\nIn NSW, warrants were executed in Lakemba, Belmore, Wiley Park, Greenacre, Illawong, Punchbowl, Hoxton Park, Condell Park, Ingleburn, Belfield, Bankstown and Kemps Creek, resulting in 8 arrests. \nA NSW Police spokesman has said that one of the men arrested was shot in the chest by police in Green Valley at about 9am, after firing at police. \"One officer was struck, we believe in the hand, and suffered a minor wound,\" the spokesman said. \"One of the police officers returned fire and the person of interest to police was wounded in the neck.\"\nIt has been reported that the arrests in Sydney, unlike those in Melbourne, do include charges relating to planning and preparation of violent acts. The suspects have not yet appeared in court and the case has been adjourned to Friday.\nMick Keelty, Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police (AFP), has said that the seven people arrested in New South Wales will be charged under the anti-terrorism legislation that was rushed through parliament last week. Mr Keelty has said that the details of the allegations against the men should be kept secret. \n\"An application will be made by the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecution this afternoon to suppress the details of the allegations,\" he said.\nKeelty justified the action by arguing that \"we give these people a fair opportunity to prepare their defence before the court rather than run the trial in the media.\"\nVictoria.\nIn Victoria, warrants were executed in Dallas, Hoppers Crossing, Fawkner, Preston, Haberfield, Coburg, Yarraville, Meadow Heights, Hadfield and Mount Druit, resulting in 9 arrests. \nVictorian Police Commissioner Christine Nixon also believes that the raids prevented a terrorist attack, however she stated that the police did not know what form the attack would take, saying \"we weren't exactly sure when nor, more importantly, what they planned to damage or do harm to.\" Commissioner Nixon said that they had sufficient evidence to proceed. \nNixon said that the raids were the result of a long-term operation.

It is not yet clear to what extent the emergency legislative changes rushed through parliament last week are a legal basis for the arrests.\nOne of those arrested in Melbourne was Abu Bakr, also known as Abdul Nacer Benbrika.

At the time he denied being involved in any terrorist activity. \nIn an interview on the \"ABC Radio\" \"National Breakfast\" program, Rob Stary, a criminal defence lawyer who will be representing those arrested in the Melbourne raids said that, as far as he is aware, the charges all relate to being a member of a proscribed organisation, and none of the Melbourne suspsects had been charged in relation to any planning or preparation offences. At the time of the interview he was not aware which proscribed organisation the charges relate to.\nSeven men have appeared in the Melbourne Magistrates Court, on charges of intentionally being a member of a terrorist organisation and knowing the organisation was a terrorist organisation. The court has heard that Abu Bakr is the \"spiritual leader\" of the group and the prosecutor alleged that the organisation is directed by Abu Bakr. Speaking of the Melbourne arrests, Prosecutor Richard Maidment QC alleged that the group constituted a \"terrorist organisation\". Making reference to the Sydney arrests he said that the Sydney suspects had \"gathering chemicals of a kind that were used in the London Underground bombings,\" and planned to kill \"innocent men and women in Australia.\""}

The documentary, entitled \"Fallujah: The Hidden Massacre\", asserts that the US military used white phosphorus on the civilian population during the bombardment, and backs these allegations with interviews with former US soldiers as well as residents of Fallujah.\nWhite phosphorus is a spontaneously flammable chemical used in battlefield illumination or to generate smoke screens. Contact with the substance results in burning and melting of skin and flesh. According to an account of a former US soldier, the phosphorus explodes and forms a plume, killing everyone within a 150 metre radius. The smoke produced by burning phosphorous converts to hot, concentrated phosphoric acid on contact with human skin, eyes, lungs and mucous membranes producing characteristic chemical burns internally and externally. White phosphorus is also a highly toxic substance with an average lethal dose (LD50) of 50 milligrams; lethal intoxication causes a slow death after 5 to 10 days.\nWhite phosphorus bombs are considered incendiary devices, though RAI claims that they are chemical weapons. The US military admits using white phosphorus to illuminate battlefields, but denies having used it as a weapon against civilians. The United States has ratified the Chemical Weapons Convetion (CWC), but has not ratified the \"Protocol on Prohibitions or Restrictions on the Use of Incendiary Weapons (Protocol III)\" which forbids the use of incendiary weapons against places with concentrations of civilians.\nA statement issued by the United States in December 2004 pointed out that phosphorus shells are not outlawed, and that \"US forces have used them very sparingly in Fallujah, for illumination purposes.\" RAI's film, however, alleges that the US has attempted to destroy footage of use of white phosphorus on civilians in Fallujah.\n\"A rain of fire fell on the city, the people struck by this multi-coloured substance started to burn, we found people dead with strange wounds, the bodies burned but the clothes intact,\" says Mohamad Tareq, a biologist in Fallujah interviewed for the film. Jeff Englehart, a former US soldier, describes on the documentary: \"Burned bodies, burned women, burned children; white phosphorus kills indiscriminately... When it makes contact with skin, then it's absolutely irreversible damage, burning flesh to the bone.\"\nThe Pentagon has previously claimed that white phosphorous was only used for illumination purposes in Fallujah: \u201cU.S. forces have used them very sparingly in Fallujah, for illumination purposes. They were fired into the air to illuminate enemy positions at night, not at enemy fighters.\u201d However, the documentary clearly shows two types of munitions being used:\nThe Pentagon and the U.S. Administration stopped short of denying the claims that white phosporus was used in Fallujah, although U.S. Marine Major Tim Keefe insisted that it was not used to \"target\" civilians. The use of incendiary weapons against civilians is banned by an additional protocol to the Geneva Conventions that was added in 1980, however the United States did not sign this protocol and it does not directly cover the use of toxic smokes.\nThe documentary also implies that US troops used Mark 77 incendiary bombs in Fallujah, which contain an upgraded napalm formulation. The main difference to Vietnam-era napalm being the replacement of gasoline with kerosene in the mixture, and it is reported that the mixture contains oxidizing agents, including white phosphorus. The US military does not call MK77 munitions \"napalm\" bombs. However, the use of MK77 munitions against Iraqi troops in 2003 had a \"strikingly similar\" effect to napalm as confirmed in August 2003 by the US military representatives Col. Randolph Alles and Col. Michael Daily."}

His supporters, who call him \"King George\", are generally made up of young men - many of them war veterans. But his opponents say that he is an inexperienced leader, without political skills.

Under current UK anti-terrorism laws, suspects can be held for up to 14 days without any charges being made against them.\nMembers of Mr Blair's Labour Party used the vote to rebel against the proposal, with a crucial 49 tipping the balance to reject it by 322 votes to 291.

In the joint release the Australian Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Attorney General welcomed the election of a New Zealander, Sir Kenneth Keith, as a judge on the ICJ, and said that \"Australia strongly supported Sir Kenneth's candidature to the Court\". Advocacy groups made the accusation because Australia withdrew from the jurisdiction of the maritime division of the ICJ in 2002, because of a dispute with East Timor. \nJefferson Lee from the NSW Branch of the Australia-East Timor Association said that \"it is hypocritical that they are celebrating the appointment of an ICJ judge given the fact that Australia withdrew from the jurisdiction of the ICJ maritime division in March 2002.\"\nA spokesman for the Minister for Foreign Affairs rejected the suggestion that the minister had been hypocritical, and said that it had always been government policy to resolve such disputes via bilateral negotiation. \n\"Maritime boundaries should be resolved by negotiation. This is how we have done it with all other countries we have negotiated with. Maritime boundaries are an issue of sovereignty,\" he said. \nMr Lee was referring to Australia's redeclaration of its recognition of the court. On March 22, 2002, Australia deposited a new declaration with the ICJ, which stated that its recognition of the Court did not apply to \"any dispute concerning or relating to the delimitation of maritime zones, including the territorial sea, the exclusive economic zone and the continental shelf, or arising out of, concerning, or relating to the exploitation of any disputed area of or adjacent to any such maritime zone pending its delimitation.\" This was widely understood at the time to be the result of Australia's dispute with East Timor over the maritime border. The declaration was signed by Mr Downer, who co-sponsored today's media release. The issue is especially important to both countries as the Timor Sea holds significant oil reserves. \nMr Lee argued that Australia was unfairly using its stronger bargaining position in negotiatons, and deliberately avoiding submitting to a decision by the court.\n\"They are constantly harping on about the necessity of resolving the Timor Sea issue by bilateral consultation between the Australian and East Timorese government rather than subjecting the dispute to the umpire, i.e. the international court of justice maritime division,\" he said. \nTom Clarke, Coordinator of the Timor Sea Justice Campaign, argues that the governments stance in relation to the ICJ is hypocritical. \n\"By picking and choosing specific parts of the ICJ\u2019s jurisdictions that it does and doesn\u2019t want to acknowledge, the Australian Government demonstrates that it does not take International Law seriously. Our Government has some shocking double standards,\" he said. \nMr Clarke also drew attention to the economic situation in East Timor. \"When we\u2019re talking about the Australian Government taking millions of dollars while East Timorese children are dying of preventable diseases, it really is no laughing matter.\"\nAssociate Professor David Reeve of the Department of Chinese and Indonesian, University of New South Wales, was asked if he thought the minister was being hypocritical. \n\"Foreign policy is a tricky business, with lots of strands. And there are always tensions between any country's idealism and interests. It often happens that different bits of foreign policy thrust may seem to be contradictory, but it's a complex world, and any government is trying to play lots of notes simultaneously. In this case I think Downer can be quite genuine in his congratulations, while the advocacy groups have a good opportunity to highlight their perfectly logical views,\" he said. \nThere has not been an Australian or New Zealand judge on the court since 1967. Sir Kenneths position with the court starts in 2006, and lasts for nine years. "}

{"id": "25898", "revid": "14511", "url": "https://en.wikinews.org/wiki?curid=25898", "title": "Research articles predict next earthquake", "text": "Two research articles published this week illustrate continuing efforts to predict earthquakes. The first article builds upon the idea that analysis of the first seismic waves from an earthquake can provide a way to generate a several second warning that an earthquake will hit. However, for such warnings to be useful, the early seismic waves should also allow prediction of the strength of the earthquake. An article published in this week's edition of \"Nature\" concludes that scientists might be able to distinguish small earthquakes from big ones by using the very first second of information contained in seismic waves. \nResearchers from the University of California, Berkeley, say the measurements of seismic waves soon after a trembler can signal whether it will be a minor or monster trembler. \"Basically, a high-pitched squeal means that you'll get a smaller quake. A low-groan means something bigger,\" says the University of California's Richard Allen. \nIn the study, Allen and colleagues analyzed records of 71 major Pacific Rim quakes in the past decades including 24 events that were greater than a magnitude 6. Using a mathematical model, they were able to estimate a quake's size to within one magnitude unit from as little as four seconds of data of the frequency of the energy in the primary wave. These low-energy waves typically cause a jolt, signaling the occurrence of a quake.\nAccording to a traditional theory, called the cascade model, we cannot know anything about an earthquake's ultimate magnitude until it is finished. This is because spread along a fault line depends on the stress in each individual part of the fault. Given that this information is not available to the initial rupture point, it should be impossible to tell from that first slip how far it will go or how long it will last.\nThe study by Berkeley's Allen and Erik L. Olson of the University of Wisconsin-Madison builds upon earlier work by Yutaka Nakamura in Japan. Nakamura's research indicated that the frequency of the P wave can allow prediction of which earthquakes will have a magnitude greater than 6 and distinguish them from small tremors that do not require warnings. Some fire stations use P wave detectors to automatically open doors in an effort to make sure that emergency vehicles are not trapped inside by doors that can be jammed shut by earthquake damage. \nThe goal of this research is to make the best possible use of the information from the earliest seismic waves emitted by an earthquake as part of an alert system to give seconds to tens of seconds of advance notice of an impending quake -- enough time for schoolchildren to take cover, power generators to trip off and valves to shut on pipelines. A major limitation of this work is that the greatest earthquake damage is near the epicenter where there is little time difference between the early P waves and the strongest damaging earthquake waves. \nThe second research paper, published this week in the scientific magazine \"Physical Review Letters\", builds upon earlier research into patterns of earthquake activity at specific faults. The new research by scientists from Israel and Germany led by Prof. Shlomo Havlin, of Bar-Ilan University's Department of Physics in Israel, concerns prediction of the timing between earthquakes.\nProf. Havlin's research, in collaboration with Prof. Armin Bunde, of the Justus-Liebig University in Giessen, Germany, and Bar-Ilan University graduate student Valerie Livina, involved a large number of past earthquakes at many different faults. The data used in this study were for earthquakes ranging from magnitude 2 to magnitude 5.5 on the Richter Scale. Data were from several areas of the world including California, Japan, and New Zealand. The new results are consistent with previous studies which have indicated that some faults have more frequent small earthquakes while other faults have less frequent and larger earthquakes."}

Married persons with an income that exceeds 500,000 \u20ac will have to pay an extra 3% on their income, the same applies to unmarried persons with over 250,000 \u20ac income.

But another three detainees are continuing to refuse food for the 25th consecutive day. The men began their hunger strike on October 20 to protest Australia's Mandatory Detention policy.\nThey said they had been persecuted by the communist regime in China and came to Australia seeking protection. Four of the detainees were taken to hospital last week but three were released on Friday. The remaining man in hospital has ended his protest.\n\"Three detainees in Villawood remain on voluntary starvation,\" an immigration department spokesman said. \"Two Villawood detainees have agreed to stop their hunger strike.\nAustralian refugee advocates say they are concerned about the welfare of the Chinese men, who have been on a hunger strike since October 20 at Sydney's Villawood Immigration Detention Centre. Three of the six men from mainland China are continuing to refuse food at the centre.\nMinister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs has refused to process the Chinese Asylum Seekers claims until they stop the hunger strike. Amanda Vanstone, urges the hunger strikers to end their protest. \"Participation in a hunger strike will not help the cause of the individuals concerned,\" the Minister said. \"I have personally written to all six to advise them that I will not be considering any cases while protest activity continues.\" \nThe six original hunger strikers said in an October 29 statement that they are protesting against Australia's Mandatory Detention policy and the mental and physical impairment caused by the long-term detention in Villawood - during which, they say, many people suffer long-term insomnia, dysphoria, and even mental breakdown. \n\"We were persecuted by the communist regime in our own country where people lost their fundamental freedom, human rights, democratic rights and rule of law. Due to the inadequacy of the detention policy in Australia, we were forced to lose our freedom again and may, at any moment, be deported back to China and face severe persecution again,\" said the hunger strikers.\nAt a rally outside Villawood on October 29, the Refugee Action Coalition (RAC) said the asylum seekers want to be released from detention while their claims for refugee status are processed. RAC spokesman Mark Goudkamp says the men have been in detention for up to nine months. \n\"We want to show people that they're not completely isolated, that they have support on the outside, and we want to get their message out as far as we can,\" he said. Mr Goudkamp says one of the asylum seekers is a Falun Gong practitioner and the others are pro-democracy, against the Chinese Government.\nIan Rintoul, also from the Refugee Action Coalition, says five of the men are asylum seekers and the sixth man's business visa has lapsed. \"The treatment of the Chinese in detention shows that the department still has to face up to the underlying problems of mandatory detention,\" Mr Rintoul said.\n\"The Chinese are facing the same obstacles and the same departmental attitudes that kept asylum seekers behind the razor wire for years. The men make the point that they feel their lives are being destroyed by mandatory detention.\"\nMr Rintoul said most of the six Chinese asylum seekers had been living in Australia since the late 1990s and had children here. All had been taken to Villawood for immigration breaches and had lodged asylum claims, some of which had been rejected and were in the process of appeal. They want to be free to be reunited with their families.\nThe Immigration Department says the hunger strike will not influence decisions on the men's applications for asylum. \nBut Mr Rintoul says that is not what the strike is about. \"What they can't understand is why that claim can't be processed while they're living in the community,\" he said. \"What the hunger strike highlights is why the misery of mandatory detention continues.\"\nPeter Job from the Victorian Greens has expressed grave concern for the remaining three detainees continuing their hunger strike past its twenty-sixth day. \"Asylum seekers who maintain they have strong claims should have their cases re-heard. Given the obviously harmful nature of long term detention they should be allowed to live in the community while this takes place,\" said Mr Job."}

Andrew Stimpson did not take any drug treatments after being diagnosed with the virus in August 2002 and was found HIV negative in October 2003.\nStimpson's two HIV tests were performed by the Chelsea and Westminster Healthcare NHS Trust. It has been reported that the hospital is standing by the validity of the two tests that have so far been performed. The hospital would like to perform additional tests that might reveal an explanation for the two contradictory test results. Tests used for diagnosis of HIV infection can produce results. When this happens, additional testing is required in order to determine if there ever was an actual infection. Some news reports suggest that Stimpson may have had contact with someone known to be HIV-positive and that multiple HIV tests performed by a clinic all gave positive results for Stimpson before he was first tested by the Chelsea and Westminster hospital. However, Michael Hopkin of the British journal \"Nature\", has reported that while Stimpson tested positive for to HIV in 2002, \"tests done during more than two dozen visits in 2003 and 2004 proved negative for the antibodies\". This suggests that either HIV infection took an unusual course in Stimpson or the original test results indicating infection were a false positive.\nMany similar cases have been reported in Africa, where the virus is widespread. Due to poor medical facilities all of these reports have been largely anecdotal\u2014Mr Stimpson represents the first well documented case. However, until additional tests are performed it is impossible to know if the second test was a . Dr. Andrew Grulich, who has a PhD in epidemiology and works at the National Centre in HIV Epidemiology and Clinical Research at the University of New South Wales has expressed doubt that Stimpson was cured of an HIV infection. In some infected patients, HIV levels can fall to undetectably low levels until their immune system is defeated and virus levels begin to rise. \nThis discovery may offer a promising new window into how the virus works and furthers hopes that one day a vaccine and/or cure will be found for the disease that is carried by around 35 million people worldwide."}

The APEC agenda includes discussions on how to enhance global free trade. \nProtesters' placards declared \"No Bush visit\" and \"No APEC\", demanding a revision of domestic labour laws to improve conditions for temporary workers. Police lined the protest route, using buses to block streets as protesters marched close to the US embassy and the presidential Blue House. City police officials said there were no reports of violence. \nThe rally was organised by the (KCTU), the second-largest labour organisation in South Korea. \n\"APEC is playing the vanguard role of spreading new liberalism in trade which makes the rich richer and the poor poorer,\" said O Jong-Ryul, head of the People's Action against APEC \u2014 another of the protest organising groups.

No serious crashes were reported.\nMore protests expected.\nSome 80 protest leaders said they would organize regular street rallies throughout the week of APEC meetings.

Police remained on alert throughout the weekend, with some 12,000 security officers deployed around the country.\nAfter more than a fortnight of civil unrest in France, police imposed the temporary public meeting ban in response to Internet and text messages calling for violent action in the French capital. The government has declared a state of emergency in Paris and 30 other areas to help quell the unrest.\nToday, Sunday 13 November, French authorities have reported less urban violence - despite fears of a rampage that prompted thousands of police to fan out at high-profile targets such as the Eiffel Tower. Across the country, the situation appears calmer. Rioting, car-burnings and arson attacks appear to be waning. \nNationwide, 374 cars were torched on Saturday night, down from 502 on the evening of November 11, police said today. About 100 vehicles go up in flames in France on a typical Saturday night.\nNational Police Chief Michel said there had been a \"major lull\" in the rioting on the 17th night of urban violence. If the calm continues, \"things could return to normal very quickly,\" he said at a news conference on Sunday. Night curfews are still in force in several areas. Mr Gaudin said there was a \"downward trend\" in the incidence of violence \"with some resistance in the Paris region. This weekend we will exercise extra vigilance in the Paris region.\" \nOn Thursday, President Jacques Chirac acknowledged that France had \"undeniable problems\" in poor city areas and must respond effectively. \"Whatever our origins we are all the children of the Republic and we can all expect the same rights,\" he said.\nSurveillance has been stepped up on suburban transport, petrol sales in small quantities have also been banned. \nMr Chirac defended his use of state-of-emergency legislation, and said the priority was still to restore order. The state of emergency, adopted on Wednesday and renewable after 12 days, allows French authorities to impose curfews in designated areas, ban public meetings, search for weapons without a warrant and issue house-arrest orders.\nSome 7,500 cars and dozens of buildings including schools and businesses have been torched since the violence began. 2,350 people have been arrested and 358 have recieived prison sentences.\nThe recent unrest erupted on October 27 following the deaths of two teenagers electrocuted while hiding from police in an electrical sub-station."}

Temperatures so far this year have averaged one degree above the 30-year average, the Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) told the Greenhouse 2005 \u2013 Action in Climate Change Conference being held in Melbourne this week.\nThe head of the National Climate Centre, Michael Coughlan, says Australia has had the warmest ever first 10 months of 2005, and seems likely to be a record-breaking year. \"It's typically been a degree or more above the average for most of the months,\" said Mr Coughlan. \"When you think you're averaging over hundreds of stations across Australia, to get a one degree warming over such a large area is fairly significant.\"\nAccording to BOM, Australia has experienced its warmest start to a year on record (since 1950), with the January to October temperature averaging 1.03 degrees Celsius above the 30 year average (1961-1990). Annual mean temperatures have increased throughout Australia since 1910, particularly since the 1950s. \n\"If one draws a trend line from the mid-50s or early 50s, through to the present, it's a fairly steady upward trend. And it's interesting that this is not true only of Australia, but it's fairly typical throughout most continents now, most parts of the world,\" said Mr Coughlan.\nAs the average temperature has risen, there has been an increase in the incidence of hot days and hot nights, and a reduction in the number of cold days and nights. This warming is mirrored in the oceans around Australia.\nMichael Coughlan says warm sea surfaces are a significant factor in the creation of cyclones and hurricanes. \"One might expect, with those sea temperatures being warmer than they have been in the last few years, that the odds would be tipped towards perhaps a greater number of the cyclones than we have seen in the last few years,\" he says.\nWarming is not the only sign of change in Australia\u2019s climate. Other changes include a marked decline in rainfall in southwest and parts of southeast Australia, and recent reduction in rainfall through the eastern states. At the same time, rainfall in the arid interior and northwest has increased dramatically, in some places nearly doubling during the last 50-years.\n\"Climate change affecting Australia is real,\" says CSIRO's Dr Bryson Bates. \"In 2005 the questions we face are how best to respond and adapt \u2013 from projections in agriculture to changing ecosystems, reduced catchment flows and downward rainfall trends,\" Dr Bates says.\nThe GREENHOUSE 2005 Action on Climate Change Conference is expected to attract 400 Australian and international delegates. \nSources.\n "}

Beneath all the glossy advertising are proposals that will unfairly curtail your rights at work, cut the amount of time you can spend with family, and erode your job security.\"\nThe federal government have spent over fifty million dollars on promoting the radical new changes.\nUnions say the changes will make it easier for workers to be sacked; cut take-home pay and reduce minimum standards; change the way minimum wages are set to make them lower; replace the award safety net with just five minimum conditions; restrict access to unions; make it harder for employees to bargain as a group; and reduce the powers of the independent Industrial Relations Commission.\"\nIn Melbourne, Australian Education Union's Mary Bluett said the IR legislation \"is not the legacy we want to leave our children.\" About 12,000 public servants, 10,000 building workers and hundreds of nurses are also expected to join the protest, but workers operating road, train, tram and bus services will remain on duty to allow commuters to travel free to the rally.\nSky News estimated the number attending the rally in Melbourne as 175,000.\nThe Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry labelled the rally \"a tired union stunt\"."}

Ministers agreed on the extension at a meeting chaired by President Jacques Chirac, and a bill on that effect will be presented on Tuesday to the National Assembly and on Wednesday to the Senate.\nThe police reported 284 vehicles being torched in petrol bomb attacks on Sunday, the 18th consecutive night of the riots. The number is lower than the previous night, when 374 cars were destroyed, and considerably below previous week's peak of 1,400.\nChirac, who has been criticized for keeping a low profile during the crisis, prepared to address the nation on Monday night in a television broadcast. Chirac was quoted by a government spokesman as saying that the emergency powers were \"strictly temporary and will only be applied where they are strictly necessary.\"\nIn spite of all departmental prefects being authorised to impose curfews, in practice only few have. The extension of powers has drawn some criticism from local mayors who have deemed it an overreaction and potentially inflammatory. The pressure group SOS Racisme said that events had shown that the prefects already had enough powers.\nSince the beginning of the unrest on October 27, more than 8,000 cars have been torched, more than 2,700 people arrested and dozens of buildings wrecked. According to Jos\u00e9 Manuel Dur\u00e3o Barroso, President of the European Commission, the European Union is prepared to release 50 million \u20ac in aid for damaged areas."}

According to police, around 150,000 people congregated in Melbourne, from where speeches were broadcast throughout the country. In Sydney, thirty thousand gathered in Belmore Park and Martin Place to watch the broadcast before marching to Chifley Square. \nSharan Burrow, President of the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU), said that under the changes many working conditions would be under threat, including \"penalty rates, public holidays, overtime pay, control over rostered hours, shift penalties, even 4 weeks annual leave.\" The government has claimed, despite various expert assesment to the contrary, and opposition from major Australian religious and charity organisations and some concern from its own backbench, that the IR changes will improve the economy and ultimately benefit workers, and dismissed the protests as having \"little effect\".\nSpeeches.\nMs Burrow said that the union movement was \"standing up for the values that shape the way we care for each other,\" and criticised the proposed legislation, calling it \"an attack on living standards, community, family life and wages.\"\nThe IR changes were also criticised by a number of church leaders. , Catholic Archbishop of Sydney, said \"I'm not a supporter of the radical weakening of the unions,\" and Anglican Bishop Phillip Higgins called them \"disturbing and unwise.\"\nMs Burrow also criticised the Government's public relations campaign, calling it a waste of money. \"They spent $55 million of our money trying to convince us that everything was okay,\" she said. \nGreg Combet, Secretary of the ACTU, linked the struggle to past wars in which Australia has fought. \"They fought and died in wars for this country. They do not deserve to have their rights taken away.\" He said that, for many, workplace changes would come quickly, especially for the most vulnerable. He also argued that some employers would be forced by competition to reduce wages and working conditions. \"Even the best employers can be driven by competition to lower their labour costs. We will end up with an army of working poor, like the US,\" he said. \n\"We will hold the government to account for the human cost of these laws,\" Mr Combet said. \nFormer Labor Prime Minister Bob Hawke said that the struggle was about what he called \"the essence of Australian character - the fair go.\" Opposition Labor leader Kim Beazley declared that if returned to government at the next election, Labor would repeal the legislation. \"This legislation is gone with the election of a Labor government,\" he said.\nGovernment response.\nPrime Minister John Howard predicted that the protests would have little effect. \"It is my view that after they (the laws) have been implemented for a period of time, most Australians will look back on the criticisms and objections ... with a sense of bewilderment,\" Howard said.\n\"The sky will not fall in, weekend barbecues will not be abolished, parents will still be able to spend Christmas Day with their children.\"\nThe Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, Kevin Andrews, echoed the Prime Ministers sentiments. \"Well the Government\u2019s not going to be distracted by rallies and hysterical overreaction,\" he said. Mr Andrews defended the Government's record, arguing that it has been responsible for an increase in wages over the past ten years. \n\"Well what I would say to Australians, whether they were the people on the streets today or the probably 95% of Australians who were in their workplaces today working, is that firstly, look at the record of this Government over the last 10 years. That record speaks for itself. We\u2019ve seen a 15% increase in real wages and we\u2019ve seen a 1.7 million increase in jobs in Australia,\" he said. Mr Andrews also said that the industrial relations changes were about creating the conditions for a strong economy. \n\"So what we\u2019ve been on about is bringing about the economic conditions that we can have a strong economy which ultimately is the only guarantee of jobs and wages in Australia.\"\nDebate over proposed legislation.\nThe claims of the Government are highly debated and not supported by some independent expert assesment. Professor Mark Wooden from the Melbourne Institute said, \"There is no economic sense in it.\" A report issued by 17 independent experts in industrial relations from Australian tertiary institutions stated that there \"is no convincing evidence that the proposals will generate jobs,\" and that the \"claim that individual contracts deliver a higher productivity is highly questionable.\"\nThe IMF said in its 2005 review of the Australian economy that \"the implementation of this package of reforms to widen employment opportunities and raise productivity by enhancing flexibility in work arrangements\" was important for Australia's economic future, contradicting Prof. Wooden's claims.\nThe OECD also supports reform to the Industrial relations system, claiming in its 2004 Review of the Australian Economy \"To further encourage participation and favour employment, the industrial relations system also needs to be reformed so as to increase the flexibility of the labour market, reduce employment transaction costs and achieve a closer link between wages and productivity.\"\nMelbourne protest.\nBefore marching to the Carlton gardens, a live video hook-up was established between the major state capitals of Australia, plus smaller regional centres.\nAccording to police, some 150,000 marched from Federation Square to Royal Exhibition building to protest the proposed IR legislation and voice opinion, vastly in excess of original union estimates of 60,000. Organisers estimated a crowd up to 245,000 while a report from Sky News from aerial observation estimated 175,000 people attending the protest. The crowd spread through the streets of Melbourne as far as the eye could see - a seemlingly endless mass from the ground. The march stretched eight city blocks; when the first marchers had reached the end at the Carlton Gardens, the tail end was just starting. \nFor the marchers, the consensus was that the negatives of the legislation outweigh the benefits; that it will affect the poorer working class and the middle class long into the future unless the legislation is rolled back. One issue of concern was that the Government has not accepted that the minimum wage needs to rise with inflation, rather its position appears to be to allow for the possibility that the minimum wage could fall in real terms. Another was the loss of the safety net protecting workers from contacts offering less than award conditions.\nPublic transport was stretched to capacity and car parking was almost impossible to find. Inclement weather ultimately became fine.\nSee the photo gallery for more photos\nSydney protest.\nAt 10am the estimated 30,000 protestors moved from Belmore Park down Hay St onto George St, chanting slogans and waving union banners. \nLed by a fire truck, traditional Korean drummers and the Unions NSW campaign bus, they stretched nearly six city blocks along George Street, chanting their opposition to the changes. \nMeeting with the rally from Martin Place, the combined march then moved on to Chifley Square, where another stage was set up, and more speakers were heard, including Peter Garrett, Federal member for Kingsford-Smith. \nGarrett spoke mostly about the dispute between Boeing and 28 aircraft engineers at its Williamtown site. The workers are on strike to obtain the right to enter into a collective agreement negotiated by their union, rather than independent agreements. The strike is now in its fifth month.\nUp to 100,000 people in NSW took part in 227 separate stopwork meetings throughout the state, linked by a nationwide Sky Channel hook up. The M4 motorway was also blocked off for nearly an hour, by transport workers and police.\nMore photographs of the Sydney protest can be seen in the Australian Industrial Relations Protest (Sydney) Gallery.\nBrisbane protest.\nIn Brisbane, Queensland, organisers have claimed success after more than 15,000 people turned out to protest against the industrial relations laws. Federal Opposition Leader Kim Beazley joined the workers, including representatives from 40 unions, who rallied at South Bank before marching to the Queensland office of the National party. \nMr Beazley told the South Bank rally that one of the first things he would do as Prime Minister would be to put in place \"a fair system\".\nQueensland Premier Peter Beattie said the State Government will push ahead with its High Court challenge to the Howard Government's proposed changes to industrial laws. \nRallies were also organised for the Gold Coast, Bundaberg, Gladstone, Rockhampton, Townsville and Cairns.\nAdelaide protest.\nIn Adelaide, the SA Premier Mike Rann told a rally, estimated by police at 15,000 workers, that the State Government will fight the proposed new laws all the way to the High Court. \"This is the most systematic attack on the values of Australian people that we've seen since the Second World War,\" Mr Rann said.\nSA Unions secretary Janet Giles was ecstatic with the response. \"40,000 people in a city of one million . . . a sensational turnout. There are people here from every union, from all industries,\" she said.\nAdelaide images here\nPerth.\nIn Perth WA commuters experienced transport disruptions today as the city came to a halt for the Rally. Police estimates put the crowd at 10,000. UnionsWA secretary Dave Robinson told those assembled near the foreshore of the Swan River that it was a historic day. Premier Geoff Gallop, WA Employment Protection Minister John Kobelke and federal Labor industrial relations spokesman Stephen Smith also spoke at the rally.\nThe government earlier today revealed that Solicitor General Robert Meadows, QC, would lead WA's High Court fight, mounted in conjunction with Queensland and NSW. Mr Kobelke said the action would seek to save 100 years of cooperative Australian industrial relations based on conciliation and arbitration. Perth images here\nOther Cities.\nAccording to the ABC, 4,500 people rallied in the Tasmanian city of Hobart. Unions say 3,000 workers have rallied at Thoroughbred Park in Canberra. In Darwin, nurses, teachers, public servants, construction workers and entire families have turned out to show that not only workers will be affected by the Federal Government's industrial relations reforms. Traffic blocked the roads leading the Fannie Bay Racecourse. Crowds jostled for space to see the satellite fed telecast from the Melbourne rally. \nWellington, NZ also showed solidarity as some 200 people demonstrated outside the Australian Embassy.\nPhoto Gallerys.\nMelbourne Gallery\nSydney Gallery\nSources.\n \n\"This original work will be also available in french.\""}

They are objectionable for abortion opponents who consider their use to be a form of abortion, though scientific studies (including those by the FDA) classify them as contraceptives. The pill, called Plan B is manufactured by Barr Laboratories and had been approved earlier by the FDA as a prescription drug.\nBarr Laboratories requested that the drug be approved for OTC sale for adults and prescription-only sale for minors. The decision to not approve went against the advice given by the FDA's Joint Advisory Committee and its Review staff and led to a GAO investigation into the decision making process. The investigation was requested by 30 House members and 17 Senators. \nThe GAO found several anomalies in the decision making process. The rationale used by Dr. Steven Galson, the acting director of the Centre for Drug Evaluation and Research for rejecting the application was novel and did not follow usual FDA practices. The decision was not signed off by the director of the office responsible for the application and the director of the Office of New Drugs, as they disagreed with the \"reject\" decision. The GAO also found that the FDA's high-level management more involved in reviewing this decision than in other change-to-OTC applications. \nThe Plan B decision was the only one of 67 proposed prescription to OTC changes to be disapproved, even after advisory committees approved the changes. FDA review staff told the investigators that they were told early in the review process that the decision would be made by high-level management. E-mail and other documents involving the then-FDA Commissioner Mark McClellan were found to have been destroyed \"routinely\".\nThe FDA has disagreed with the GAO's finding that the high-level management was more involved in processing this application and that the rationale offered was novel, despite acknowledging that the adolescent cognitive ability rationale was unprecedented in FDA practice. The accounts as to whether the decision to reject was taken prior to the reviews being completed offered to the investigators were conflicting. \nThe acting director cited concerns about the potential behavioral implications for younger adolescents from OTC marketing of Plan-B, given their supposed lower cognitive ability, and that it was not valid to extrapolate data from older to younger audiences. However, the FDA had not considered similar \"potential behavioral implications\" for younger users for other OTC-switches and had previously considered it appropriate to extrapolate data from older to younger audiences.

The move follows a number of reports of the virus spreading within the country and other Asian countries such as Vietnam engaging in culls to try and halt the disease's spread. \nMillions of infected birds have been slaughtered in China and despite the spread of the virus it is only today that the World Health Organization has confirmed the first human cases in the country. The cases include at least one fatality, a 24-year-old female poultry worker in the eastern province of Anhui. The other confirmed case is a 9-year-old boy in the central province of Hunai who has since recovered.\nIt should be noted that these cases are the only documented cases reported. Obtaining truly accurate numbers is a challenge in China and elsewhere because bird flu outbreaks tend to occur in rural communities where there are not good hospital or laboratory services. Even if bird flu is suspected, blood samples have to be sent to one of only 200 specialized laboratories around the world. The cost of identifying and transporting to these labs from rural areas can be prohibitive even if the physicians in those areas are aware of such laboratories. There is little incentive for outbreaks to be reported by farmers, because any confirmation of a bird flu infection will results in the farmer's flock being destroyed and that may destroy the farmer's livelihood. \nThe officials in Liaoning have reportedly finished vaccinating all 320 million birds in the northeastern province. David Nabarro, the United Nations coordinator for bird and human flu, says such vaccination programs are \"the right thing to do\" since slaughtering the animals will not work due to the virus being so entrenched in China's birds.\nAccording to Henk Bedekam, the World Health Organization's representative in China, the time of year is favourable to the continuation of the disease. He said that since the virus can survive in the cold, winter outbreaks are to be expected during cold months.\nAvian influenza continues to be a very rare disease in humans, and so far only seems to be transmitted to people through direct contact with infected birds. Experts, however, are afraid that the virus will mutate into a strain that will be easily transmitted between humans.\nElsewhere in Asia, the lethal H5N1 strain of the avian flu has infected at least 126 people and killed at least 64 since 2003. WHO spokeswoman Maria Cheng said, however, that there is no increased risk of an influenza pandemic since there has been no observed genetic change in the virus or spread between humans."}

Embedded Journalist Darrin Mortenson, who was with U.S. troops during the operation in Fallujah, already reported in April 2004 that a mortar team leader \"directed his men to fire round after round of high explosives and white phosphorus charges into the city Friday and Saturday\".\nThe U.S. State department initially denied that white phosphorus was used as weaponry, but Pentagon spokesman, Lt. Col. Barry Venable said white phosphorous munitions were used as an incendiary weapon against enemy combatants. \"It was not used against civilians,\" he said in a Tuesday briefing. Lt. Col. Venable repeated U.S. State department statements that white phosphorous munitions are a standard field artillery element. Up until at least April 2001 it was \"against the law of land warfare to employ WP against personnel targets\" according to the U.S. Army Battle Book.\nThe Pentagon briefing directed reporters to the March-April 2005 edition of the U.S. Army's Field Artillery magazine, where veterans of the Fallujah action described their use of white phosphorous munitions to \"flush [insurgents] out\", and it use as a screening agent (providing smoke cover) and as \"a potent psychological weapon against the insurgents in trench lines.\"\nThe 1980 Convention on Conventional Weapons (Protocol III), which the USA is not a signatory to, disallows the use of incendiary weapons against civilian populations or air attacks against troops stationed in a civilian population center, but does not outlaw its battlefield use. General George Casey's 8 November 2004 briefing estimated the number of civilians still in Fallujah as between 20,000 and 100,000 civilians.\nWhite phosphorous burns at temperatures near 5,000 degrees Fahrenheit (2760 C). It is used to start fires and can cause severe burns where it strikes humans. The Italian documentary showed photos of what it said were Iraqis who had been burned by the white phosphorous. The accepted lethal dose of white phosphorous is 1mg/kg.\nThe smoke raises contentions for its battlefield use. It is primarily used as a \"marker\", as the high temperature combustion causes \"pillaring\" of the smoke column. But the smoke does contain phosphoric acid and traces of unburned phosphorous, which is corrosive to human tissue (internally and externally.) The US Army Field Manual cautions \"Phosphorous smoke produces phosphoric acid. Soldiers must wear respiratory protection, such as protective masks, if exposed to phosphorous smoke.\""}

The November 8 decision, based on a 1955 statute, could last for a maximum of 12 days only, after which Parliament had to vote on an extension.\nThe state of emergency allows local authorities () to prohibit public meetings and regulate movements of persons, including curfews. In addition, in certain zones specified by the executive, where riots have recently taken place, local authorities may close meeting halls or bars; detain firearms; and authorize searches inside habitations during the day or the night by administrative order (normally, searches during formal criminal investigations have to be authorized by a judge). The government said that it will not use the power to regulate the media, and that searches will be subject to supervision by the judiciary.\nThe law was defended by Nicolas Sarkozy, in charge of law enforcement. Sarkozy spoke before the French National Assembly (which approved the text on November 15) and the French Senate (which approved it on November 16); he defended the actions of the government and explained why, in his opinion, the law had to be voted. Sarkozy is also the head of the UMP party, which holds a majority in both houses, and there was no doubt that the text would be approved.\nSarkozy added that in the forthcoming months, (riot division of the ) and \"Gendarmerie mobile\" forces would operate daily in difficult suburbs as a \"proximity police\". He contended that the \"proximity police\" established by preceding left-wing government was too much concerned with social activities and not enough about arresting criminals. Sarkozy has also contended that some of the riots were orchestrated by drug traffickers, gangsters and other criminals in order to secure lawless zones.\nThe French Socialist Party opposed the law, claiming it was excessive. Some left-wing members of parliament contended that using a law passed in 1955 to help quashing Algerian independence movements against children of Algerian immigrants was somewhat insensitive and unsuccessfully proposed an amendment to repeal the 1955 law. On the other hand, right-wing anti-immigrant politician has contended that the government was far too soft and called for the use of military force. Jean-Marie Le Pen, a longtime opponent of immigration from poor, Muslim countries, pointed out that the events vindicated what he had long said.\nMembers of Sarkozy's UMP party blamed the de facto of some African immigrants for the failure of their families to raise and educate children properly. They suggested a more restrictive approach to immigration.\nNicolas Sarkozy is a probable contender for the 2007 presidential election. According to polls, his approval rate jumped by +11 to 63% during the events; he leads the approval opinions for presidential candidates."}

There is question, however, as to what end the use of these weapon is legal under conventions of war.\nThe way white phosphorus munitions are used determines if it falls in the category of chemical weapons, says Professor Paul Rodgers from the University of Bradford department of peace studies. \"It is not counted under the chemical weapons convention in its normal use but, although it is a matter of legal niceties, it probably does fall into the category of chemical weapons if it is used for this kind of purpose directly against people.\" Professor Paul Rodgers is the writer of the book \"A War on Terror: Afghanistan and After\".\nAs reported on November 15 in the UK's Independent, according to three artillery men writing in the March-April edition of Field Artillery, the magazine of the US Field Artillery based in Fort Sill, Oklahoma, which is readily available on the internet, white phosphorus was used \"as a potent psychological weapon against insurgents in trench lines and spider holes...We fired 'shake and bake' [a combination of white phosphorus and explosives] missions at the insurgents using WP to flush them out and high exposive shells (HE) to take them out.\" \nA spokesman for the US military, Lt. Col. Barry Venable, said yesterday when US admitted the use of white phosphorus as an incendiary weapon, that \"White phosphorus is a conventional munition. It is not a chemical weapon. They are not outlawed or illegal.\" He added that \"it was used as an incendiary weapon against enemy combatants.\" \nRobert Tuttle, the American ambassador to London, wrote \"U.S. forces do not use napalm or white phosphorus as weapons,\" in a letter to the Independent newspaper. When confronted with the US militaries' admission, an embassy spokesperson said \"all questions on WP\" should be referred to the Pentagon.\nSir , Member of the British Parliament (Liberal Democrat), says: \"The use of this weapon may technically have been legal, but its effects are such that it will hand a propaganda victory to the insurgency. The denial of use followed by the admission will simply convince the doubters that there was something to hide.\" \nThe Independent article concludes with a quote from Kathy Kelly of the group Voices in the Wilderness. She said: 'If the US wants to promote security for this generation and the next, it should build relationships with these countries. If the US uses conventional or non-conventional weapons, in civilian neighourhoods, that melt people's bodies down to the bone, it will leave these people seething. We should think on this rather than arguing about whether we can squeak such weapons past the Geneva Conventions and international accords.'\nWhite phosphorus. A conventional or a chemical weapon?\nBattlefield concentrations of white phosphorus gas are generally considered harmless: there are no documented cases of white phosophorus gases resulting in fatalities. However, its use as an incendiary is under question. The United States reportedly ordered civilians to evacuate areas wherein white phosphorus was going to be used.\nBut claims that U.S. use of white phosphorus--or 'Whiskey Pete' or 'Willy Pete', as it is called by the military--contravenes the 1993 Chemical Weapons Convention, are based on its prohibition of any \"toxic chemical\" weapons which cause \"death, harm or temporary incapacitation to humans or animals through their chemical action on life processes.\" The fact that direct exposure to white phosphorus produces precisely such effects on humans has been substantiated by numerous sources, both medical and military. However, since the effect of white phosphorus is largely incendiary, and incendiaries are specifically not precluded, there is some ambiguity regarding the classification of white phosphorus weapons.\nThe Iraqi government will investigate the American use of white phosphorus munitions during the battle of Fallujah. The inquiry will try to determine whether US forces committed war crimes according to international weapons treaties."}

Mr Rumsfeld and his delegation arrived at Adelaide Airport this morning amid tight security. Mr Rumsfeld and other senior members of the United States government will attend the Australia-United States Ministerial Meeting (AUSMIN), to be hosted by Defence Minister Robert Hill and Foreign Affairs Minister Alexander Downer.\nThe rally, labelling Mr Rumsfeld a war criminal, also called for the freeing of Australian man David Hicks from Guantanamo Bay jail. \nIn a press conference held on Thursday, Defence Minister Robert Hill said that Hicks would probably be discussed, however he is not on the agenda. When asked why, Mr Hill replied, \"Because the trial of David Hicks in the United States, allegations that he breached US law, is not a matter of national security between Australia and the United States. But because he came from Adelaide, I have no doubt that the issue will be raised. And we would say what we have been saying, which is that we would like to see the trial progressed as quickly as possible.\"\nAustralian Democrats SA leader Sandra Kanck said the rally was originally intended to protest at the proposed new terror laws. \n\"We would not need terror laws if our Prime Minister had not tied us to the coat tails of George W Bush and Donald Rumsfeld,\" she said. \"I have been delighted to hear much sedition here today and I have been delighted to see placards that are saying seditious things. \"But by Christmas this may not be allowed in our democracy.\"\nThe government has previously rejected such criticism of the proposed anti-terror laws, arguing that protest and free speech will not be affected. Attorney-General Phillip Ruddock said in an interview last week that \"there is very clear protection of fair comment.\" He also said that criticism of the new legislation is based on a misunderstanding of the role of definitions in legislation. \n\"Most of the arguments I've seen ... has been predicated on a view that if you look at the definition of \u2018seditious intent' which is for definitional purposes, that that is in fact constituting an offence. It is not one of the offences. And to use \u2018seditious intent' as a basis for looking at what people would be prosecuted for misunderstands basic statutory interpretation,\" Mr Ruddock said. \nStrict security precautions ensured demonstrators could not get near Mr Rumsfeld, who is in Adelaide for ministerial talks between the US and Australian governments. \nSouth Australian Greens MP Kris Hanna said Mr Rumsfeld was a symbol of that power and money which runs the United States and Australia. \"They are willing to kill, they are willing to murder innocent civilians by the tens of thousands to exploit the resources of other countries and sacrifice even their own soldiers for these goals of war and expropriation.\"\nDeputy US Secretary of State Bob Zoellick will also take part. Police in Adelaide have thrown a tight security net around the conference venue and hotel where the guests will stay, with up to 500 officers involved. \nYesterday, SA's assistant police commissioner described Mr Rumsfeld as one of the world's top terrorist targets. \nArrests.\nOne man at the rally was removed by police and faces a disorderly conduct charge. South Australian police confirmed the 24-year-old man was removed from the protest outside the state parliament building, about 5pm (CDST). \n\"A 24-year-old man has been removed from the parliament house area and reported for disorderly behaviour,\" Superintendent Neil Smith said tonight. \"He will receive a summons to appear in court at a later date.\" \nPolice removed and then later arrested the man who allegedly clashed with a sole pro-US demonstrator.\nBan on Rumsfeld protest removed.\nParliamentary officials had originally banned the rally, saying demonstrators would be arrested if they went ahead with the protest. But South Australian parliamentary speaker Bob Such yesterday said the protest may proceed.\nDr Such said the initial ban was made on advice from police. But he said he was subsequently advised that he could consider applications from people wanting to protest during the visit.\nThe Rice Rumsfeld Reception Committee said the decision to lift the ban was a \"victory for democracy and the right to dissent\". \nSandra Kanck described the ban as foolish and a dangerous attack on free speech. Police said they would not tolerate violent protests."}

It is a flawed policy wrapped in illusion...Our military is suffering, the future of our country is at risk. We cannot continue on the present course. It is evident that continued military action in Iraq is not in the best interests of the United States of America, the Iraqi people or the Persian Gulf region.\"\nPresident Bush and members of his administration and the Republican Party in recent days have been criticizing Democrats who are calling the pre-war intelligence that made the case for the war in Iraq both false and misleading. Republicans, calling a Democrat \"cut and run\" strategy irresponsible, say abandoning Iraq now would lead to civil war.\nOver the Veterans Day weekend just past, the president of Iraq, Jalal Talabani, said on British \"ITV\u2019s\" Jonathan Dimbleby program, \"Within one year - I think at the end of 2006 - Iraqi troops will be ready to replace British forces in the south.\" But Murtha's heart-felt news conference, where AP writer Liz Sidoti said his voice cracked while he told of visiting wounded soldiers at a nearby Washington veterans hospital, was spurred by an obligation to speak for the troops. \nMurtha, who had served as a Marine Corps intelligence officer in Vietnam, angrily denounced Vice President Cheney's recent \"stay the course\" rhetoric with sarcasm: \"I like guys who've never been there that criticize us who've been there. I like that. I like guys who got five deferments and never been there and send people to war, and then don't like to hear suggestions about what needs to be done.\"\nMurtha continued with multiple reasons he says caused him to come forward at this time; \"Our military has been fighting this war in Iraq for over two and a half years. Our military has accomplished its mission and done its duty. Our military captured Saddam Hussein, captured or killed his closest associates, but the war continues to intensify. Deaths and injuries are growing, and over 2,079 of confirmed American deaths, over 15,500 have been seriously injured -- half of them returned to duty -- and it's estimated over 50,000 will suffer from what I call battle fatigue. And there have been reports at least 30,000 Iraqi civilians have been killed...Oil production and energy production are below prewar level. You remember they said that was going to pay for the war, and it's below prewar level...Unemployment is 60 percent...And, most importantly -- this is the most important point -- incidents have increased from 150 a week to over 700 in the last year. Instead of attacks going down over a time when we had additional more troops, attacks have grown dramatically. Since the revolution at Abu Ghraib, American casualties have doubled.\" Murtha said.\nMurtha said he would be introducing legislation forcing U.S. troops out of Iraq.\nThe House Democratic Leader, Nancy Pelosi, said of Murtha\u2019s statements, \"I think it speaks very strongly to the point that the President's policy is not working; two-and-a-half years after the President said, 'mission accomplished,' we still don't know what the mission is. So the focus really shouldn't be on Mr. Murtha, it should be on the President of the United States and his failed policy there.\"\nIn new PEW poll released today, public opinion jumped from 30% in 2002, to 42% today who believe that America should \u201cmind its own business\u201d internationally.

The genetically modified field pea's protein was found to have a slightly altered structure which caused an allergic-style reaction in the lungs of mice and led scientists to believe it could have similar effects on human lungs.\n\"That was enough to alert me to say this research should come to an end,\" CSIRO Plant Industry Deputy Director TJ Higgins said.\nAn earlier example of a problem with a GM food was a protein-enhanced soy product that was abandoned because the Brazil nut gene transferred to the soy produced a protein that could cause allergic reactions in some people. That 1996 study was conducted and funded by the University of Nebraska and Pioneer Hi-Bred International. \nEnvironmental activism organizations like Greenpeace were spawned by the negative effects of the Petrochemical era. They are now campaigning against GM research. Greenpeace members have observed that not all reports of possible complications from GM foods found during product development have resulted in a quick end to further research. Rootworm-resistant GM corn caused \"serious organ damage\" to rats in Germany, but the corn developed by Monsanto was approved for consumption in Australia by Food Standards Australia New Zealand said Greenpeace GM spokesman Jeremy Tager. A scientific review panel of the European Food Safety Authority reviewed the results of a 13-week rat feeding study on rootworm-resistant corn that had been submitted by German authorities. Although the study found some differences in the kidneys of rats fed the GM corn, the scientists concluded that these results were \"not considered to pose concerns over the safety of MON 863 maize\". Many published studies performed with rats and other test animals have found no danger from the Monsanto rootworm-resistant corn. Within science, it is desirable that all research reports be reproduced and confirmed.\nAustralia has a $100 million field pea industry, so substantial amounts of chemicals are used to protect the industry's crops against the pea weevil Bruchus pisorum, though some crops use organic control options. The pea weevil can cause yield losses of up to 30 per cent a year if left uncontrolled. So the CSIRO is in search of an alternative to using genetic modification. The CSIRO are not alone in the GM industry. Bayer and Monsanto are both privately owned corporations who also operate outside Australia's strict regulatory system. A spokeswoman for Bayer Crop Sciences said the CSIRO's decision had no impact on the firm's GM work. Monsanto has not responded to media inquiries.\nDr Higgins said the findings proved the safety of Australia's strict research regulatory framework.\n\"I think that this shows that the regulatory system works,\" he said.\n\"The regulations are stringent, they are difficult, but on balance I'm very pleased as a consumer of food myself that these regulations are in place.\"\nThe genetically modified pea plants were produced by transfer of the \"amylase inhibitor-1\" gene from a species of bean. The structure of the alpha-amylase inhibitor-1 protein produced by the pea plants is slightly different from the structure of the same protein when made by bean plants. This structural modification may be due to differences in posttranslational modification of the protein. The altered protein from peas was found to predispose mice to a form of food antigen-stimulated inflammation response that is mediated by CD4-positive T helper cells."}

Many called for a boycott of Singaporean products.\n25-year-old Nguyen was arrested at Changi Airport in 2002 for carrying heroin and sentenced to death in March. Nguyen claims he carried the 396 grams of heroin strapped to his body in an attempt to pay off his brother Khoa's $30,000 legal debts.\nThe Singapore government have announced they will execute Nguyen at dawn on December 2nd. Singapore President S. R. Nathan rejected Nguyen's clemency four weeks ago. The Melbourne salesman was sentenced to death under Singapore law which determines a mandatory death sentence for anyone found guilty of possessing 15 grams of heroin or more.\nNguyen's mother was informed on Thursday by registered mail from the Singapore prisons service of the execution date. The letter stated that she should start making funeral arrangements. She will get to see her son in the three days leading up to the execution.\nDespite repeated pleas for clemency from many thousands of supporters; religious groups; human rights organisations; the Pope; and the Australian Government - including Prime Minister, John Howard - Singapore officials have said Nguyen's execution is irreversible.\nMr Howard had argued that Nguyen should be spared, citing mitigating circumstances in his case which pointed to the fact that he was not a serial drug trafficker but had merely been trying to pay off his brother's debts.\nThe Victorian Attorney-General, Rob Hulls, says the Singaporean Government has shown no compassion whatsoever in its treatment of Van Nguyen and his family.\n\"What's happening is brutal, is inappropriate. I, and the Victorian Government, vehemently oppose the death penalty in any circumstances\", he told ABC Radio. \"This is a young kid who has assisted the police all the way... In any other country, he would get a discount in relation to the penalty. But because there is a mandatory death penalty for drug offences in Singapore, this young man may well be executed. It is just grossly inappropriate.\"\n\"Singapore maintains that capital punishment is a criminal justice issue; it is the sovereign right of every country to decide whether or not to include capital punishment within its criminal justice system,\" a Foreign Ministry spokesman said. \nSingapore argues that there was no international consensus that capital punishment should be abolished. At the most recent meeting of the UN Commission on Human Rights, 66 countries dissociated themselves from a resolution calling for the abolition of capital punishment. \nPrime Minister Lee Hsien Loong affirmed Singapore's position by saying that it has to \"stand firm on drugs to protect its citizens from the scourge and to ensure the country does not become a conduit for the trafficking of illicit drugs.\"\nIn reply to a letter appealing for clemency from his Australian counterpart Alexander Downer, Singapore Foreign Minister George Yeo said: \"Mr Nguyen imported almost 400gm of pure heroin which would have supplied more than 26,000 doses to drug addicts.\"\nNo one will be permitted to see Nguyen on the morning of his execution. His body will be released to his mother. \nBungle over execution date release.\nOn Thursday, a letter informing Nguyen's mother of the Dec 2 date was accidentally sent earlier than intended by the Singapore authorities. As a result, Australian Prime Minister John Howard was caught offguard when asked by reporters on Thursday if he knew that Nguyen would be executed on Dec 2.\nAustralian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer yesterday admitted he had been told several days ago that a letter would be sent this week to Nguyen's mother. Mr Downer said his Singapore counterpart, George Yeo, had told him on Monday night, when they were both in Busan, that the family would be sent a letter which they would receive yesterday.\n\"So the Singapore Prime Minister had assumed that the letter would arrive on Friday,\" Mr Downer said. \"The letter arrived a day earlier than they had anticipated.\" \nAustralian Prime Minister John Howard said yesterday the differences between Australia and Singapore over the planned execution of convicted drug smuggler Nguyen Tuong Van would not damage relations between the two countries.\n\"It is not an issue where we agree but our disagreement on the treatment of Mr Nguyen is not going to contaminate the very good relationship between Australia and Singapore,\" Mr Howard was quoted as saying in an AAP report.\nLawyers say: regime should change.\nMr Lex Lasry, QC, who heads Nguyen's Melbourne legal team, recently told Singapore's high commissioner in Canberra that the \"regime\" of the mandatory death penalty would have to change.\n\"At some point, the Singapore Government must realise as a First World country it can no longer continue to impose mandatory death sentences. They simply can't keep doing this to people,\" he said. He described as an \"outrageous injustice\" the Singapore law that denies lawyers the chance to argue to a judge why a client should not be hanged.\n\"Let the rest of the world know we are not prepared to tolerate it and ultimately they will have to change their minds,\" he said. \n\"Even if our client is executed as he probably will be, the campaign against Singapore's mandatory death sentence will continue,\" Mr Lasry said. \nMr Lasry said the fight to save Nguyen would continue over the next few weeks.\nExecution methods reviewed.\nNguyen Tuong Van may be the last person to face the hangman in Singapore after a review of execution methods in Singapore. The nation's chief hangman, Darshan Singh, has told prison officials he wants to retire, but finding a replacement has been unsuccessful. One of two candidates picked to replace Mr Singh was unable to complete his first execution. A second left the prison service.\nMr Singh, a veteran of over 850 hangings, is reportedly unhappy with the new machinery, which is prone to malfunction. \"The Australian\" newspaper reports that Singapore officials have been studying other methods of execution and are considering the lethal injection technique used in the United States. \nThe lethal injection method being considered by Singapore officials as an alternative is modelled on the procedure introduced in 1977 in Oklahoma. The prisoner is strapped to a gurney and an intravenous tube is inserted into each arm with a flow of harmless saline solution. At the warden's signal, 5g of sodium pentothal is administered, which renders the prisoner unconscious.\nIt is followed by pancuronium bromide, a muscle relaxant that paralyses the diaphragm and lungs, and finally potassium chloride, which causes cardiac arrest.

According to an investigation by the Senate Intelligence Committee, the main source for this information was an Iraqi defector codenamed Curveball who was a source for the German central intelligence agency BND.\nSeveral German intelligence officials responsible for Curveball have now told the LA Times that the Bush administration and the CIA have repeatedly exaggerated his claims and ignored warnings of the BND that the source was unreliable. Recounting his reaction after seeing Powell's United Nations speech one German intelligence officer said: \"We were shocked. Mein Gott! We had always told them it was not proven... It was not hard intelligence.\" This corroborates reporting by the German weekly newspaper Die Zeit from 2003 and 2004 based on statements of unnamed senior German intelligence officials.\nNine months earlier, in May 2002, a fabricator warning was posted in Curveball's file in U.S. intelligence databases. Powell was never warned that his United Nations speech contained material that both the DIA and CIA had determined was false, even though several people present at Powell's CIA meetings were fully aware of this.\nAt this time German intelligence officers would not let the CIA meet directly with Curveball, but allowed a CIA doctor to draw blood samples. Questioning the validity of Curveball's information in front of his CIA supervisor, the doctor was advised to \"Keep in mind that this war is going to happen regardless of what Curveball said or didn't say and the Powers That Be probably aren't terribly interested in whether Curveball knows what he's talking about.\"\nShortly after Powell's UN speech and several days before the invasion, United Nations weapons inspectors attempted to directly verify several key claims made by Curveball, but concluded that they were unsustainable. The White House insisted on its WMD claims based on Curveball's information.\nEven after the invasion, when more and more of Curveball's accounts were shown to be pure fabrication, the CIA and the Bush administration relied on Curveball's information. When U.S. forces discovered trucks with lab equipment and Curveball claimed that these were identical to the ones he has been reporting about, the CIA rushed to publish a White Paper claiming that these trucks were part of Saddam Hussein's secret biological weapons program and Bush claimed publicly that \"We found the weapons of mass destruction.\" Several days later, twelve of the thirteen WMD experts who analyzed the trucks agreed that the equipment was not suited for biological weapons production, with the only dissenting voice coming from the author of the original White Paper. \nThe White Paper remains posted on the CIA website to this date, and President Bush has not yet retracted his statement that Iraq produced \"germ warfare agents\" made in his State of the Union address or his postwar assertions that \"we found the weapons of mass destruction.\" "}

A Christian wedding will follow at Sacred Heart Cathedral in Suva next week.\nIntermarriage between Fiji's indigenous and Indian communities is uncommon. Speaking for the family, Chaudhry's elder brother, Rajendra, said that the union was for love and that nothing political should be read into it. The union was a personal love-match between two who had known each other for more than six years, he insisted, and dismissed media speculation that the wedding was intended as a statement about uniting the two races, whose historical, cultural, religious, and political divisions have defined Fiji for generations. It was a proud day for the family.\nMa'afu's ancestor, Enele Ma'afu, was a Tongan prince who was exiled to Fiji following disagreements within the Tongan royal family. He conquered Taveuni and the Lau Islands, taking the title of \"Tui Lau\" (King of Lau). He later participated, with the Fijian King Cakobau, in the ceding of the islands to the United Kingdom in 1874. The Tui Lau title has since been held by such noted individuals as Ratu Sir Lala Sukuna (considered modern Fiji's first statesman) and Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara, independent Fiji's first Prime Minister and second President.\nChaudhry, who traces his ancestry to the state of Haryana, in north India, became the first of his race to be elected Prime Minister in 1999.

No damage has been reported in the city of Darwin or the community of Port Keats which is the nearest town to the quake's epicentre in a region known for its moderate seismicity. The quake's epicentre was located 500 kilometres west-north-west of Darwin in the Banda Sea. The earthquake hit at 9.51am (CDT).\nGeoscience Australia (the government's geological organisation) says the region may be unstable for a few days and aftershocks or another quake may be felt. Duty seismologist, Dr Svetan Sinadinovski, says it was a shallow quake and the subterranean make-up of the area allowed the tremor waves to travel to Darwin without losing much energy. He says the quake was on Australia's continental shelf, which is a common place for seismic activity.\n\"That is the area where Australian plate collides with Asian plate and that extends through the Indonesian islands up to Sumatra and Thailand in the north and east through PNG to Tonga and New Zealand,\" he said. \"Preliminary reports point to a 5 to 6 in the Darwin region - this means that the earthquake would have been felt by almost everyone indoors according to the Modified Mercali Scale which measures the impact of seismic waves on structures.\"\n\"People would have felt this earthquake up to 500km away from the epicentre, and we have heard numerous reports of residents in the Darwin area having felt the effects of the event,\" he said.\nAmong those who felt the quake were participants involved in the trial of Bradley John Murdoch in the Northern Territory Supreme Court in Darwin - where chairs and TVs shook in the court building. \nThe Bureau of Meteorology's Darwin office was also shaken, but no reports of damage have been received by police.\n\"We felt it - I felt the building sway and some of the monitors shook a little,\" the bureau's duty forecaster, Billy Lynch, said. \"We are on the third floor of a three-story building.\"\nSumatra Earthquake.\nAn earthquake with a magnitude of at least 6.2 struck off the coast of Sumatra yesterday, triggering a tsunami alert, officials said. There were no immediate reports of a tsunami, damages or casualties. The quake's epicenter was located off Simeulue, 160 miles southwest of Medan on Sumatra's northwest coast, according to the U.S. Geological Survey(USGS).\nIndonesia's Meteorology and Geophysics Agency put the quake's magnitude at 6.2, whilst the USGS said the magnitude was 6.5. The quake rocked nearby Nias island and was felt in Medan, said an official from the Indonesian agency's Jakarta office.\nSimeulue island is near the epicenter of the December 26 quake that caused a massive tsunami. The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center in Hawaii said there was no threat of a tsunami to Pacific coastlines, but quakes of this size can sometimes generate local tsunamis along coasts near the epicenter. \nSumatra has been affected by strong aftershocks since the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake. Experts say the fault line is unstable and may produce another massive quake soon. \nOther earthquakes.\nThe biggest earthquake to strike the region, in 1998, had a magnitude of 6.9. The largest earthquake ever recorded was in Chile in 1960. This magnitude 9.5 earthquake resulted in the death of 5,000 people. In 1976 a smaller 8.0 earthquake in China caused the death of an estimated 255,000 people. More recently, in December 2003 an earthquake in Iran resulted in the death of approximately 50,000 people. \nGeoscience Australia said the 5.3 quake did not generate a tsunami. The 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake, which had a magnitude of 9.0, triggered a series of lethal tsunamis on December 26, 2004 that killed over 270,000 people, making it the deadliest tsunami in recorded history. \nIn March 2005 another strong earthquake rocked parts of Darwin, with tremors lasting several minutes felt across the city and rural areas. The quake measured 7.2 on the Richter scale, and its epicentre was 500 kilometres east north-east of East Timor in the Banda Sea."}

Common press reports only describe fewer than 130 people as infected with H5N1 avian flu and that fewer than 70 have died worldwide. Yet, there are enormous problems getting accurate data, especially in a country like China with a population of more than a billion.\n\"Reporting a suspected bird flu infection in bird or humans is a very unlikely event,\" said Dr. Shoshana Zimmerman of the eHealth Institute. She is also a founder of www.birdflubeacon.com, a site dedicated to bird flu issues. \"There are very few incentives to report, and lots of reasons to refrain from reporting. From the viewpoint of local rural small farmers, there is little to be gained and much to be lost by reporting an infection. The worse threat is that their flocks could be killed, leaving them destitute.\" \nThere are many factors which mitigate against reporting bird or human infections of bird flu.\nA young woman, Zhou Maoya, died after returning home to the village of Yantan in Annui province to prepare for her wedding. Her family has stated that they did not take her to the hospital because they thought it would not do any good. Officials also note rural Chinese also often cite relatively expensive medical costs as a reason for not seeking treatment when sick. \nAlthough initially authorities attributed her death to pneumonia the resulting political pressure prompted China to invite the World Health Organization to send experts to investigate. The authorities then rescinded the previous position and attributed her death to bird flu based on the similarity of the symptoms that she was reported to exhibit with those of bird flu. The village was quarantined and journalists were denied access. It is not known how many others might be infected in the village. Official announcements were made of plans to vaccinate and cull birds. \nA local government official, Fan Qian, told \"AFP\" that it was believed Zhou was infected while she was outside of the province.\nFan Tan, a local official, told \"AFP\" news that 1,000 birds in Yantan had been culled (killed). Plans were announced to vaccinate 2 million poultry in the area, a huge and difficult task.\nZhang, another official, said authorities had met with all villagers to give them flu vaccinations and to tell them how to protect themselves against the bird flu virus, including not consuming poultry products. It is known that flu vaccinations do not protect against bird flu.\nVillagers and local officials minimized the threat. In outlying areas of Yantan, residents said that they did not know of any new outbreaks. Other possible infections have been attributed to similar common causes but there have not been any tests performed validating those attributions.\nFan Litan, a peasant woman from Fantu village, about 2 miles from Yantan, lost many of her ducks, and chickens and also a dog; she has attributed these deaths to the acts of hooligans. She said her family had been extremely frightened when her animals suddenly died. \"We were scared to death,\" said Fan, standing next to a red sign posted on the outside wall of her home that said: \"Prevention and control by the masses is basic for people.\" Fan said ducks and chickens are all healthy but she admitted that she had stopped eating poultry. No testing of these birds has been reported yet.\nAccording to a recent \"AFP\" report from Liuchang, 59 miles south of Yantan, the obstacles to identifying infections are enormous.\nLike many, one Liuchang villager named Wang Hemin said he was concerned and would keep a closer eye on his ducks and chickens, but felt no immediacy since the infection was not in his province. He learned about bird flu on TV, and is aware that officials have come to his village of 2,700 people to warn residents about the virus. They offered guidelines: they told people that poultry which die suddenly could have contracted bird flu and should not be eaten or sold and that such an incident should also immediately be reported. However, the symptoms of H5N1 bird flu were not directly described.\nResidents have not yet been fully informed of what symptoms to look for in ill poultry--they are fever, diarrhea, teary eyes and swelling in the legs of the birds. Though a pledge was made earlier in the week to vaccinate 2 million birds immediately, no bird vaccinations in this area have been reported yet.\nIn another nearby village, Nazahuang, chickens scuttle in and out of houses. One resident, Fan Jiexu, 73, said no officials had yet warned her village to take precautions. Throughout rural areas, it is customary for chickens to scuttle in and out of homes. Ducks and bird often die and are eaten by villagers when it is believed safe to do so.\nChina has reported 17 avian flu outbreaks as of this week. Despite the Chinese government issued high alerts, critical information is not being adequately communicated to some rural villages. The size of the poultry population, the common and normal occurrence of poultry death on farms, and status of roughly 70% of the poultry population as being kept in backyards are factors complicating infection control.\nThe head of World Health Organization's China office, Henk Bekedam, is aware that slow reaction to bird flu threats and difficulty monitoring poultry in the world's most populous country makes control of its spread challenging. \nTesting is required to confirm H5N1 virus, and positive test results lead to the killing of nearby flocks. The incentive for many villagers, officials, and governments to minimize reports of H5N1 virus infections and severe medical and economic complications for making confirmations of infection are obstacles opposing complete and full reporting of the spread and infection rates of the virus."}

The Department of Immigration, Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (DIMIA) said four men, one woman and two infants from West Timor were taken from Darwin to the remote detention facility, 2,600km north-west of Perth on November 17. \nThe group arrived on a small boat at Honeymoon Beach, near Kalumburu a remote Aboriginal community on the northern coast of Western Australia's far north, on November 5. Locals were startled when three of the men waded ashore to ask for directions to the nearest city. After returning to sea with directions to Wyndam, 400km south-east of Kalumburu, the Australian Navy's HMAS Geraldton caught up with the group and tethered their boat alongside. The group were taken into detention in Darwin. \nThe Australian government enforces a policy of mandatory detention of unauthorised arrivals. Christmas Island is an Australian Territory, its closest neighbour is Java, 360km away.\nDIMIA, which had originally planned to deport the group, say the West Timorese will remain on Christmas Island while their claims for refugee protection are assessed. \"The group was going to be removed having initially not raised claims or information engaging Australia's protection obligations, but since that initial screening the group raised new issues and so their claims will be further examined now,\" a DIMIA spokesman said.\nDemocrats Senator Andrew Bartlett said he was concerned the children were in detention despite a government promise that such an arrangement would be a last resort. \"We want to know exactly what the cost has been to unnecessarily fly these people over to Christmas Island and why, seeing that they managed to arrive within the accepted migration zone and should be processed here,\" he said.\nDIMIA said the cost of housing the group in the reactivated Christmas Island facility was not yet known, and that such transfers were standard practice. DIMIA said the children would be in the facility on a short-term basis.\n\"Once initial processing is complete - a week or two weeks probably - it is planned that the family of four who are within that group of seven ... will live in the Christmas Island community under residents determination arrangements, while the three single men will be accommodated in the centre there,\" the DIMIA spokesman said.\n\"Following consultations with their lawyer, they will be interviewed by an experienced protection visa case manager assisted by a qualified interpreter to establish whether they are in need of protection.\"\nIn a May 2004 report, the National Inquiry into Children in Immigration Detention, the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission (HREOC) found that children in Australian immigration detention centres have suffered numerous and repeated breaches of their human rights. The report stated that the long-term impact of Australia's immigration detention system meant that these children \"will carry the scars of their detention experience throughout their lives.\" \nThe report said, \"Despite ten years of a mandatory detention regime, the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs' own administrative measures and instructions virtually ignored the special needs of children. There was also little regard paid to obligations arising from the Convention on the Rights of the Child.\"\nFirst \"boat people\" in 2 years.\nThe West Timorese group are the first asylum seekers apprehended in Australian waters since a group of Vietnamese people arrived off Broome, on Western Australia's west coast more than two years ago.\nThe Christmas Island detention centre also was re-opened for the Vietnamese asylum seekers - who are now living in the Australian community under refugee protection status. The 54 Vietnamese people were detained for over two years were fleeing political persecution. The federal government granted protection visas (TPVs) to the Vietnamese detainees in July this year.\nIn July, West Australian refugee advocate Kaye Bernard, slammed the two-year remote detention as an expensive, unfortunate mess. \"It is clear now that this whole sorry mess of two years of unnecessary detention for the Vietnamese kids and their families, costing in excess of $50 million, leaves a bad taste in the mouths of many Australians,\" she said. \"This decision shows that the processing of these people by DIMIA was 100 per cent wrong and requires examination under the scrutiny of a royal commission.\"\nNew detention facility.\nThe Christmas Island detention centre is part of the Australian government's Pacific Solution. The federal government is spending over AU$200 million to build a new 800 bed detention centre on the remote island. \nAustralian Greens Senator Kerry Nettle called on Amanda Vanstone the Immigration Minister in April 2005, to explain the government's plans for Christmas Island detention centre following reports that all Australia's immigration detainees will be held on the island. There are plans to shift all detainees to the island, according to the Shire President of Christmas Island, who says that all future unauthorised boat arrivals will be detained there.\n\"The government should be closing detention centres, not building new ones,\" Senator Nettle said. \"Christmas Island's new detention centre serves no purpose beyond furthering the Coalition's political ends at a cost of over $300 million dollars to the public. If there are no plans to change the role of Christmas Island's detention centre why is the government spending $300 million on an upgrade? \""}

His father died in World War II, only a few months after Schr\u00f6der's birth. He initially worked as a sales clerk and earned his high school diploma studying at night. He studied law in G\u00f6ttingen and worked at the University there, joining the Social Democrats and became chair of the Young Socialists, the youth organisation of the party. In 1980 he was elected to the Bundestag and later became governor of Lower-Saxony. In 1998 he was the SPD's successful candidate for chancellor, forming a coalition government with The Greens. After the resignation of Oskar Lafontaine in 1999, Schr\u00f6der also became chair of the SPD, a post he held until 2004. His coalition was re-elected in 2002.\nAfter a humiliating defeat of SPD in North Rhine-Westphalia, Schr\u00f6der called for an early election. During a tough campaign, Schr\u00f6der managed to get the SPD nearly as many votes as the CDU, clawing back a significant advantage the party had over his entering the campaign.\nSchr\u00f6der announced that he will give up his seat in the Bundestag and practise as a lawyer again."}

Bush about wishing to bomb the headquarters of Arabic TV station Al Jazeera in Doha, Qatar. According to \"The Daily Mirror\", the President was dissuaded from bombing Al Jazeera's headquarters in Qatar by UK Prime Minister Tony Blair. The newspaper said its story was based on information from an unnamed source with access to the \"top secret\" memo of the President and Prime Minister's conversation.\n\"The Daily Mirror\" reports that one of its sources said Bush \"made clear he wanted to bomb Al-Jazeera in Qatar. Blair replied that would cause a big problem. There's no doubt what Bush wanted to do \u2014 and no doubt Blair didn't want him to do it.\" \"The Mirror\" is a United Kingdom-based tabloid, which has been under scrutiny in the past for publishing faked photographs depicting British soldiers abusing Iraqi detainees.\nThe document is said to be a transcript of a conversation between Bush and Tony Blair at the White House on the 16th of April 2004, when the second US offensive force enacted on the Iraqi city of . \nBush administration officials have criticized the Qatar-based network for their coverage of the War in Iraq and of other Middle East affairs. Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz had earlier accused the station of \"inciting violence against [US] troops\". Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld called the network \"a mouthpiece for Al-Qaeda and a vehicle of anti-American propaganda\". In a news conference a day before the document's supposed date, Rumsfeld was quoted as saying the following about the network's coverage of the War in Iraq: \"I can definitively say that what Al-Jazeera is doing is vicious, inaccurate and inexcusable.\"\nWhile a UK Government official was quoted in the report as saying Mr. Bush's remarks were intended as \"humorous, not serious\", another source with apparent access to the memo told the newspaper that \"Bush was deadly serious, as was Blair. That much is absolutely clear from the language used by both men.\" The \"Washington Post\" quoted a senior diplomat saying that Bush's remark as recounted by \"The Daily Mirror\" \"sounds like one of the president's one-liners that is meant as a joke\", adding that \"it was foolish for someone to write it down, and now it will be a story for days.\"\nThe authenticity of the documents and its alleged contents have not been verified independently.\nThe source of the leak, , 49, a UK civil servant, is charged under Section 3 of the , of passing the memo to MP 's former assistant . Section 3 concerns \"a person who is or has been a Crown servant or government contractor\" and who made a \"damaging disclosure\" of \"any information, document or other article\" that relates to \"international relations\" or was \"obtained from a State other than the United Kingdom or an international organisation\". A document is deemed \"damaging\" if \"(a) it endangers the interests of the United Kingdom abroad, seriously obstructs the promotion or protection by the United Kingdom of those interests or endangers the safety of British citizens abroad; or (b) it is of information or of a document or article which is such that its unauthorised disclosure would be likely to have any of those effects.\"\nBoth Keogh and O'Connor are scheduled to appear in court later next week. Clarke has returned the memo to Downing Street and said O'Connor had behaved \"perfectly correctly\".\nThe British attorney general threatened newspapers with proscecution under the Official Secrets Act if they revealed any further details of the document. The British government has before obtained court injunctions against newspapers, but never prosecuted editors for publishing contents of leaked documents. According to \"The Guardian\" this \"is believed to be the first time the Blair government has threatened newspapers in this way\". Knowing the legal ramifications, MP, and editor for the conservative magazine \"\", Boris Johnson has offered to publish the full text of the leaked document and risk a jail sentence, if someone can provide him with a copy in the next couple of days. Arguing for the publication he said: \"Sunlight is the best disinfectant. If we suppress the truth, we forget what we are fighting for.\"\nFormer British defense minister called for the full text of the memo to be published. \"I believe that Downing Street ought to publish this memo in the interests of transparency, given that much of the detail appears to be in the public domain\". He added \"If it was the case that President Bush wanted to bomb Al-Jazeera in what is after all a friendly country, it speaks volumes and it raises questions about subsequent attacks that took place on the press that wasn't embedded with coalition forces.\" Al-Jazeera's Kabul office was hit indirectly by two US bombs in 2001 and Al-Jazeera's reporter was killed when two US missiles hit the Al-Jazeera office in Baghdad in 2003. The US has denied targeting the Al-Jazeera offices deliberately.\nAl Jazeera has reacted cautiously to the report, releasing a statement in which it said it was investigating it and urged the US and UK governments to make the documents in question publicly available.\nA spokesperson for the White House dismissed the allegations, saying, \"We are not going to dignify something so outlandish with a response.\" Downing Street declined to make a statement, telling BBC News that official procedure prevents it from commenting on \"leaked documents\".\nSources.\n "}

Bush ordered Jose Padilla, detained by the US Military as an alleged terrorist, to be transferred out of military custody in order to face trial in a federal criminal court. He is charged with conspiracy to commit murder, kidnapping, aiding terrorist groups and other acts against US nationals outside the United States. These actions come six days ahead of a decision by the US Supreme Court on whether it should review the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeal's ruling that the president is authorised to hold Padilla as an \"Enemy Combatant\" without charge. \nJose Padilla, a US citizen born in Brooklyn, has been held without charge in a military brig at a US Navy detention facility in South Carolina for the three-and-a-half years since his arrest in 2002. The administration had at the time alleged that Padilla was plotting to detonate a Radioactive \"dirty\" bomb in the US and later, Deputy Attorney General James Comey alleged that he was involved in plots to blow up Hotels and high-rise buildings. The present indictment does not include any charges over these allegations. Instead, Padilla is charged with travelling abroad to train in \"violent Jihad\", providing material support to terrorists by sending money, physical assets, and new recruits to Jihadi groups, and conspiring to murder individuals overseas. \nThe change in custody restores to Padilla a number of rights he had been denied when the administration designated him as an \"Enemy Combatant\", including the right to access federal courts and be defended by an attorney. That constitutionality of detaining suspects without charge under this designation has been challenged in court, on behalf of Padilla and in September, a 3-judge panel of the 4th US Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the government's powers to detain Padilla. The Supreme Court was set to decide on whether it will review that decision next week. Padilla's status, for the purpose of this trial, is that of an ordinary criminal indictee, possessing the legal rights conferred on him by the US Bill of Rights.\nConstitutionality of Padilla's Detention.\nThe existence of the classification of \"enemy combatant\" has no precedent in either US or international law, and allows detention without reference to the customary judicial protections for criminal defendants in the US, and also without reference to the acts of congress and the agreements made in the Geneva Conventions regarding the treatment of prisoners of war.\nSeveral precedents exist for the habeas petition put forth by Padilla's attorney, Donna Newman. In June 2004, the Supreme Court ruled in the case of Yaser Hamdi that enemy combatants captured on foreign battlefields were entitled to some due process determination of their status. Hamdi was released on condition that he remain in his parent's homeland Saudi Arabia. Hamdi is a US citizen who had been captured among Taliban fighters in Afghanistan and who was similarly classified as an enemy combatant. In a case decided around the same time, the high court ruled that prisoners at Guant\u00e1namo could seek habeas relief in US courts. It, however, avoided ruling on Padilla\u2019s petition and voted 5-4 that Padilla's initial appeal should have been in Charleston, South Carolina, where he was being held, rather than in New York, where he was first held as a material witness.\nPadilla\u2019s attorney, Donna Newman, filed a new habeas petition in South Carolina, where United States District Judge Henry F. Floyd ruled that Padilla was required to be charged with a crime or released. Floyd wrote of the Bush administration\u2019s position that \u201cwere ever adopted by the courts, it would totally eviscerate the limits placed on presidential authority to protect the citizenry\u2019s individual liberties\u201d. Floyd is one of the justices appointed by President Bush. Floyd\u2019s decision was reversed in September of 2005 by a three-judge panel of the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals, led by Michael J. Luttig. Luttig claimed that Padilla served as a guard for the Taliban and Al Qaeda in Afghanistan during the period that US troops were engaged in combat against those organizations, and that he then \u201ctraveled to the United States for the avowed purpose of further prosecuting that war on American soil, against American citizens and targets\u201d.\nPadilla filed a second petition last month with the Supreme Court that was aimed at appealing Luttig\u2019s ruling. Padilla\u2019s lawyers intend to continue to proceed in the Supreme Court after the release of their client from military custody. Andrew Patel, Newman\u2019s co-counsel, said on the radio show Democracy Now! that \u201cthe threat posed by the Bush administration\u2019s invocation of the \"enemy combatant\" doctrine still exists\". Patel further stated in opposition to the claim by Gonzales claim during the Tuesday indictment announcement that the case is moot, \"We will ask the Court to consider this very important issue. Not only is it not moot as to Mr. Padilla\u2014for example, suppose he was acquitted of this charge or the case was somehow dismissed, and the government decided that, 'Well, we don\u2019t want him out,' and they just declare him to be an enemy combatant and send him back to the brig again. Until the Supreme Court rules that the president does not have that power, that's an authority, as Justice Jackson said in his dissent to Korematsu [the World War II Japanese-American internment case], that lies around like a loaded gun ready to be used or abused at any time.\"\nPadilla's detention and present Indictment.\nThe development of this case began with Padilla's arrest at Chicago\u2019s O\u2019Hare Airport in May of 2002. Former Attorney General John Ashcroft announced in June of the same year that a plot to explode a radioactive dirty bomb in America had been stopped; and described as a goal of several Al Qaeda operatives, including Padilla. On this basis, President Bush declared Padilla to be an \u201cenemy combatant,\u201d and authorized his transfer to a Naval brig, with the requisite limitations on his developing of a defense thus imposed by the classification. By June 2004, court reverses allowed Padilla to meet with legal council. Additional charges of plotting to destroy hotels and apartment buildings were claimed against Padilla by the Justice Department. These charges, however, were not included in the indictment released Tuesday.\nThis indictment focused on conspiracy charges against Padilla, particularly that he conspired with Adham Amin Hassoun, Kifah Wael Jayyousi, Mohammed Hesham Youssef and Kassem Daher to send funds, physical assets and recruits intended to continue fighting in Afghanistan, Algeria, Bosnia, Chechnya, Lebanon, Libya and Somalia. Further, it is charged that this was done through multiple front groups, including the American Islamic Group, the Islamic Center of the Americas, and Save Bosnia Now. The support for this conspiracy is claimed to have begun in 1993 and continue until November 2001 and consists of conversations obtained by wiretaps including alleged code words including \"friends,\u201d \u201cfootball,\u201d \u201ctourism,\u201d \u201cfresh air,\u201d and \u201cpicnics,\u201d. The indictment further includes various payments of ranges from 1,000 to 5,000 USD. Padilla is mentioned as a \"recruit\" who had traveled to Egypt and Afghanistan where he completed a \u201cMujahideen Data Form\u201d. He is not alleged to have engaged in any violent activities. \nGonzales also alleged that the conspiracy advocated \"acts of physical violence such as murder, maiming, kidnapping and hostage-taking against innocent civilians,\" but this was not included in the Tuesday indictment."}
