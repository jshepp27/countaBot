The Genographic Project leaders say that they will make the information from their project public and will not patent genes. Whether or not researchers using the data will be subject to licensing guidelines, or whether they can patent their own discoveries using the data, remains to be answered.\nIn the last decade, the role of IBM tabulating machines in the Holocaust has been explored and criticized by a number of historians, and National Geographic has often been a target of critical theorists who have seen it as often representing the \"gaze\" of imperialism and Orientalism.\nPrevious genetic mapping projects which focused on specific ethnic groups have met with continuous controversy, with allusions often made to the projects of racial anthropometry of the early 20th century which served as the \"scientific\" backbone to scientific racism and eugenics legislation. Though the Genographic Project participants have tried to emphasize that their project will be to look at the \"similarities\" between different groups of people rather than the \"differences,\" it seems likely to remain a controversial issue."}

The parliament voted on the Romanian Accession Treaty with 497 positive votes, 93 negative votes and 71 abstentions. Bulgaria received a slightly more positive message, with 522 votes in favour of its Accession Treaty, 70 negative votes and 69 abstentions.\nAfter this vote, which was legally-binding, the two countries will sign their Accession Treaties on April 25, when they will move from being candidate countries to accession countries - that is, from April 25, the two countries will send observers to the European Parliament and will receive larger amounts of pre-accession funding.\nPositive effects.\nThe approval of the Accession Treaty is a very positive signal for Romania and Bulgaria, confirming their progress towards EU accession until this stage. Both countries started negotiations with the EU in 2000, and completed them in 2004.\nThe approval of the Treaty is expected to encourage greater foreign investment to the two countries. Already, the fact that they were EU candidate countries has made them more competitive than their neighbours. For example, Romania received $5.5 billion of foreign investment in 2004, triple the amount received in 2003. Bulgaria also attracted $2.54 billion, the highest per-capita amount in the region. Stocks have also risen, with the Bucharest-based BET10 exchange rising 84% in the last 12 months, and Sofia's Sofix rising 69%.\nAlso, the countries will benefit from a greater role within the European Union. They will send observers to the European Parliament from April 25, which will be able to take place in debates, even though they will not have voting power. Also, the countries will receive more funding between 2005 and 2007.\nA long way to go.\nThis step was one of the largest hurdles that the two countries faced before accession in 2007. Once the Accession Treaty has been signed, the only way that accession can be postponed is through the implementation of a safeguard clause by the European Commission, which can take place if either of the two countries are unprepared for joining the EU in key areas or have major problems with the last phases of accession.\nHowever, despite the positive effects of the Accession Treaty vote, Romania and Bulgaria still have a significant amount of work to do in order to be fully prepared to join the EU in 2007. The establishment of an independent judiciary is a major issue in both countries, as is corruption. Additionally, the European Parliament has notified Bulgaria that it must deal with in a more dynamic manner. In the case of Romania, the EU has said that more progress must be made in bringing competition law up to EU standards, as well as protecting the and reducing state aid to loss-making industries such as the steel sector.\n, the European Commissioner for Enlargement, said that \"These countries still have a lot to do. They have criteria to fulfill so the safeguard clause doesn't kick in.\" If the safeguard clause is implemented, accession will be postponed until 2008. However, in the case of Bulgaria, the safeguard clause can only be implemented if all 25 member states vote unanimously on it. In the case of Romania, only a majority vote is needed.\nIn either case, analysts are predicting that both countries would have to face very major problems in key areas for the safeguard clause to go into effect."}

The party promised that funding for education, health, transport and international development would not be cut, and spending on police, defence and pensions would be increased.\nFlexible childcare and school discipline: The manifesto promised an increase in maternity pay and more choice of childcare. Under a conservative government more independence over expulsions and admissions would be given to school heads and governors. Special schools for disruptive pupils would be created, and more vocational courses would be created for 14-16 year olds.\nBetter healthcare and cleaner hospitals: A major feature of the coservative campaign has been hospital sourced infections, and in respose the party have promised to introduce ward matrons charged with keeping hospitals clean, with the authority to close wards with MRSA infections. A Conservative government would contribute funding towards operations in private hospitals. Econimic migrants with HIV or TB would not be allowed to live or work in Britain.\nSafer communities and more police: A Conservative government would increase police recruitment by 5,000 a year. The manifesto promised to increase prison terms and increase Britain's prison capacity by 20,000 places. The party would reverse the Labour government's decision to relax laws prohibiting Canabis use.\nSecure borders and controlled immigration: The manifesto proposes a new border police at Britain's busiest air and sea ports, with 24 hour surveilance. The party would set a quota on economic migrants and reject asylym-seekers who are not vetted by the UNHCR.\nParty leader Michael Howard summed up the manifesto: \"If you long for cleaner hospitals, more police, school discipline, controlled immigration, lower taxes and accountability - you can vote for it, on 5 May\", accusing prime-minister Tony Blair, who is campaigning for his third term, of letting the country down.\nResponse.\nThe manifesto has been criticised by the Labour Chancellor, Gordon Brown, for being unrealistic in its extimates of savings, and in predictions of economic growth resulting from tax cuts, calculating that there would be approximately \u00a318 billion annual deficits.\nLabour's election strategist, Alan Millburn, said that the manifesto shows that the Conservatives still stand for privilege and not opertunity, and described it as the shortest suicide note in political history.\nThe Deputy leader of the Liberal Democrats, Sir Menzies Campbell, claimed that claimed that \u00a35.5 to 8 billion of cuts were unrealistic.

The study is a groundbreaking attempt to gain insight into the spiritual lives and concerns of students and improve how faculties and administrators at US colleges and universities address this part of their students' lives.\nThe study, named The Spiritual Life of College Students, was conducted by the Higher Education Research Institute (HERI), a research center of higher education in the United States. HERI is based in the Graduate School of Education &amp; Information Studies (GSE&amp;IS) at University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). \nHERI also produces a widely-cited annual Survey of Entering Freshman through its Cooperative Institutional Research Program (CIRP) program.\nStudy methodology.\nCo-Principal Investigators of the Project were Alexander Astin, Founding Director of HERI and widely-cited author of 20 books on higher education; and Helen Astin, psychologist, professor at UCLA, and author of 11 books and many articles on women, leadership and spirituality. The study was funded by a grant from the John Templeton Foundation.\nThe study has so far been undertaken in two major phases. First a pilot survey was taken in Spring 2003 by 3,680 undergraduates at 46 US colleges and universities.\nResults from that survey were used to revise the questions, then the survey was given again in Fall 2004 to 112,232 students, the freshman classes of 236 US colleges and universities in the United States. The study included both quantitative (multiple choice) and qualitative focus group interview approaches. Copies of the questionnaires which were administered are available from the center's website.\nHERI also conducted a secondary survey of faculty to assess their spiritual beliefs in conjunction with this study.\nA follow-up survey of students is planned for Spring 2007 when they are expected to be juniors.\nGoals of the research.\nGoals of the in-depth, multi-year project are to:\nFor purposes of the study, the spiritual aspect under discussion was taken to refer to varying concepts such as traditional beliefs, mystical experiences, and a personal sense of meaning and values, in other words, \"our interiors, our subjective life, as contrasted to the objective domain of material events and objects.\" \nResulting data.\nThe differences and similarities in students' beliefs, activities and affiliations were examined along a number of dimensions, to assess the impact of the students beliefs on their daily lives. The results are summarized below. Note that the terms describing the various categories are taken verbatim from the survey results. Note also that some of the percentages add to more than 100% because the answers were not mutually exclusive and more than one answer could be checked.\nAffiliations.\nThe survey offered 20 choices of religious affiliation of various kinds, which may be broadly classified as Christian sects, Buddhist, Islamic, Jewish, Other, and None. The most numerous categories of response were:\nThe fact that the survey was administered only at US schools agrees with the expression of predominantly Christian opinion.\nBeliefs.\nHere is a quick summary of some of the major beliefs and interests of the students, that may be seen to indicate their overall level of involvement with such issues:\nLifestyles.\nSome of the findings in this area include:\nAlthough this percentage seems high, the proportion of US adults who pray is even greater at 82%, according to the Barna Group. This fact is \"not surprising\" according to the author of the article in the Christian Science Monitor, given that college students are widely perceived as being hedonistic and less than serious.\nPolitics.\nStudent's religious beliefs and affiliations were correlated with their political orientation in some predictable and some unexpected ways.\nUnexpectedly however, very religious students were found to be more likely to oppose the death penalty and affirmative action, but to hold generally similar views to less-religious or spiritually inclined students on issues of race and sex.\nThe study also noted \"sharp differences\" in areas such as legalized abortion, casual sex, same-sex marriage, and the legalization of marijuana based on the students' level of religiousness or spirituality.\nReligious tolerance.\nThe findings on religious tolerance seem consistent overall with the practice of reconciling contradictions of religious faith in a modern, pluralistic society.\nConfidence Levels.\nThe student's personal level of confidence in their own belief was also studied:\nExpectations.\nThe survey also attempted to address how students feel about the role their schools should play in assisting their personal spiritual quest.\nThe results seem to indicate a substantial demand for greater support of student's religious and spiritual pursuits by the colleges and universities they attend. This in turn suggests that future programs to address these kinds of needs may be developed at some colleges in response to the awareness raised by this study."}

The proposal would make it a category IV misdemeanor if a conviction for negligence is gained against a pet owner charged for their dog biting someone, punishable by a $250 fine. For a second offense, the penalty can go up to $1000 or 6 months in jail, and for a third offense, $2500, or a year in jail. The legislation, if enacted, would enable the creation of a criminal profile for a negligent animal owner and the animal itself.\nOn a \"CBS6\" news report broadcast recently on an Orange County boy killed by the family dog, they said the station received many angry e-mails from dog owners about the story when it was aired earlier that day. It is a topic that draws strong views from both sides of the argument, and probably explains why the Commonwealth of Virginia has been strangely quiet on the subject. It appears the state government is willing at this point to let it be slugged out at the county level, while remaining distant and learning from it above the fray. This means that if a Spotsylvania County dog owner cannot abide a new law that might fine him $250 because his dog bit the mailman, he can move to a nearby county where no such law exists.\nThe legal wording the county might use in drafting the legislation should not concern itself with the species of pet. All pets should be affected because the legislation should be indiscriminate. What it needs to concern itself with is what meets the definition of a pet, and exactly what negligence is.\nRecall that Dianna Large, now charged with a felony, originally said she owned only 1 of the 3 pit bulls involved in the attack that killed an elderly woman. Even if she later recanted that, if her defense can show that her status as pet owner of the other 2 dogs is only slight, or if it exists at all under current law, that would have a big impact on the case.\nThere will be a public hearing on May 10 to discuss proposals that may change county legislation."}

The FDA had decided to ban the supplement based on a reverse logic that the product had to be proven safe. The lawsuit effectively argued that it is the FDA's task to prove that all dosage levels of ephedrine were unsafe. The court agreed with the manufacturer that this assumption could not be proven and, when taken in low doses, less than 10 mg, that agree with the product labeling, ephedrine was not shown to be an \"unreasonable or significant risk.\"\nA group of private researchers claimed that ephedra was the most dangerous herbal product on the market.

The report predicted that the Romanian economy should increase steadily over the next three years, with a rise in gross domestic product (GDP) of about 6.2% per annum until 2008. By the end of 2008, this should lead to Romania's gross domestic product being nearly 30% larger than it was at the end of 2004. For 2005, the prediction is that the economy will grow by 6%, after last year's impressive growth of 8.3%. The reason for the slowing of growth is due to government reforms from 2005-2008, as well as counter-inflationary policy, which are expected to stabilise consumption and therefore slow growth. Despite this, even a growth rate of 6% is one of the highest in the region, and well above the European Union average.\nConcerning the structure of GDP between 2005 and 2008, the largest increases are expected to be recorded in the services and industry sectors. While total agricultural output is also expected to rise, it will contribute a smaller share of GDP in comparison to 2004, when a good harvest enhanced total GDP growth by nearly 3%.\nThe other important macro-economic indicator that the report said Romania must focus on is inflation, which is expected to lower to 7% this year, after a rate of 9.2% in 2004. The National Bank of Romania and the Romanian government have pledged to lower inflation until the country's EU accession in 2007. While unemployment dropped to 6.2% in 2004, one of the lowest rates in Europe, it is expected to rise in 2005 to around 7%, due to structural reforms of the economy, as well as a drop of state subsidies to key industrial sectors. However, by 2008, the forecasted unemployment rate is 6.1%.\nWhereas GDP growth, inflation and unemployment are all expected to improve favourably until 2008, the weaker point in the economy is the current account deficit, which should continue to increase until 2008, according to the National Forecast Committee. In 2006, the current account deficit is expected to be 6.2% of GDP, while in 2008 it will be around 5%. While these rates are an improvement of the 2004 figure of nearly 7%, they still remain fairly high. On the other hand, direct foreign investment is expected to rise significantly until 2008, covering a portion of the current account deficit. Foreign invesment in 2005, should reach 4.1 billion euros this year, and will probably increase significantly from 2007 onwards, as Romania becomes a member of the European Union."}

Dr. Cerf is considered to be one of the fathers of the Internet. One of the problems with having a video on demand service is video files take quite a bit of bandwidth to distribute. Through the use of file sharing, the clients that are requesting a video can share information amongst themselves and can take some of the load off of the original distributor. The only draw back to using file sharing is the distribution would not be instant; instead, it would have to be pre-recorded like TiVo.\nIronically, the movie industry has been suing people for file sharing for years now. In the end, this same technology might save the movie industry millions. Cerf said, \"They are only just now starting to come to honest grips with the possibilities of using the Internet,\" according to \"ZDNet Australia\".\nCurrently, waves of lawsuits against internet file-sharing services continue to be mounted. 11 countries across Europe and Asia have seen lawsuits filed against individuals by record companies fighting file-sharing technology which they say is costing it billions.

Hungary is one of the biggest supporters within the EU of Croatia joining the organisation.\nCroatia, which has the status of candidate country within the EU, said in 2004 that its target is to join the EU in 2007, along with Bulgaria and Romania, even though the EU has as of yet refused to start accession negotiations, which usually take in excess of two years. For this reason, the earliest Croatia could feasibly join is in early 2010, with accession negotiations ending in late 2007 and a further two full years during which the Accession Treaty is signed and the country prepares for final EU accession.\nThe country was scheduled to start negotiations in mid-March of this year, but these were postponed indefinitely by the EU, which accused Croatia of its alleged failure to co-operate fully with the International War Crimes Tribunal in the Hague. The allegation lies on the fact that the EU believes Croatia knows information about the whereabouts of fugitive General Ante Gotovina, accused of ethnic cleansing against the Serbs. The Croatian government has repeatedly maintained that it knows nothing about Gotovina and therefore cannot extradite him to the Hague.\nWhile Hungary wanted negotiations to start in March, a group of countries, led by the United Kingdom, France, Germany and the Netherlands, said that the Southeastern European country is not yet prepared politically to start accession talks.\nHungary also said that it feels pressured by other EU governments to not support Croatia's bid. Prime Minister Gyurcs\u00e1ny said that, \"Some diplomats came to us saying that these sort of governments would not be happy if we support Croatia.\" He went on to say that the case against Croatia starting negotiations is made up only of rumours and allegations without any evidence.\nCroatia is home to a a sizeable minority of Hungarians. After fellow EU member Slovenia, Hungary's closest partner country is Croatia. Economic co-operation between Hungary and Croatia is also quite large.\nHungary joined the European Union in 2004, along with several other Central European, Baltic and Mediterranean countries."}

Essential to this scheme is the creation of a central database for passport holders that contains fingerprint and biometric data. This database, along with fingerprinting facilities, will be shared by the controversial scheme.\nThe UK Passport Service is a \"royal prerogative,\" meaning the proposals do not require parliamentary approval. Critics say this is an attempt by the government to introduce key elements of the Identity Card scheme by stealth, without approval, appearing to reduce the cost and novel controversiality of the scheme.\nThe national fingerprint and biometric database is the most controversial element of the British government's Identity Card proposal, which drew debate prior to the recent election. All UK residents would be required to register on a central computer database \u2014 containing at least the fingerprint, iris scan, photograph, address and birth date and place of each resident.\nFurther information stored on individuals may include police, motoring, financial, health, telephone and email communications and movement data.\nThis would be used by government agencies including the police, immigration, medical and social security. Access would likely be extended to overseas intelligence agencies such as CIA and Interpol. Partial access would be given to banks and other parties interested in secure identification.\nThe database itself may be administered by the private sector. Critics argue that there is huge potential for willful misuse of this personal data.\nSpeaking to , the home affairs spokesman, Mark Oaten, said the government was trying to hide the true costs of its Identity Card scheme by turning the passport into a biometric identity card.\n\"The compulsory identity cards scheme is an expensive white elephant and a serious threat to civil liberties. It is an abuse of democracy for Labour to use the royal prerogative to put the nuts and bolts of the system in place without parliamentary approval,\" Mr Oaten told \"The Guardian\". \"There are no international obligations on the UK to put fingerprints in passports. The idea raises important privacy questions which must be properly debated, both in public and in Parliament.\"\nOther elements of the Identity Card Scheme are being trialed and costed under the UKPS. \"Silicon.com\" reports:\n\"Other projects under way at the UKPS include:\"\n\"- Trials of the Personal Identification Project (PIP), testing the use of data sharing with the private sector and other government departments to strengthen identity authentication\"\n\"- Cutting fraud by creating an electronic link to birth, marriage and death records to eliminate reliance on paper documentation\"\n\"- Launch of an electronic passport application system integrated with UKPS' back-office processing in the third quarter of this year.\"\n\"- Creation of a person-centric database. UKPS said there could be significant benefits in storing the data on a person-by-person rather than a passport-by-passport basis.\"\nThe British Government has not yet answered critics claims that the scheme is unwarranted and harmful.\nEuropean governments have come under pressure from the USA to produce passports that incorporate a biometric chip. They have imposed a deadline of 26 October 2005 after which EU citizens without a biometric chip will require a visa to visit or transit in USA.

However this situation has now been avoided with the vote by delegates to amend Rule 42 to allow soccer and rugby to be played at Croke Park during the redevelopment of Landsdowne Road.

A few minutes later, the bells of St. Peter's Basilica began ringing, confirming the election. Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger had been selected as the successor to as the 265th Pope of the Roman Catholic Church, and will be known as Pope Benedict XVI.\nThe conclave of 115 cardinals started the process of electing a new Pope on Monday, April 18. However, it has taken two days for the required two thirds majority to be reached.\nThe new Pope appeared to the public within an hour of the first announcement. He appeared on the central balcony of St. Peter's Basilica and delivered a short address to the crowd in Italian. Tens of thousands of people were in St Peter's Square to observe the results of the election.\nThe election of Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger follows the death of Pope John Paul II on April 2.\nBiography.\nPope Benedict XVI, born Joseph Ratzinger (born April 16, 1927) is pope of the Roman Catholic Church. In 1981 Cardinal Ratzinger was appointed prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith (formerly known as the Office of the Holy Inquisition) by Pope John Paul II, made a Cardinal Bishop of the episcopal see of Velletri-Segni in 1993, and was elected Dean of the College of Cardinals in 2002, becoming titular bishop of Ostia. He was one of the most influential men in the Vatican and a close associate of the late Pope John Paul II. He presided over the funeral of John Paul II and also presided over the Conclave in 2005. During the \"sede vacante\", he was the highest-ranking official in the Catholic Church.\nOn January 2, 2005, Time quoted unnamed Vatican sources as saying that Ratzinger was a front runner to succeed John Paul II should the Pope die or become too ill to continue as Pontiff. His see, Cardinal-Bishop of Ostia, has traditionally been an antechamber to the Papal seat.\nHowever it is important to note that Ratzinger's election to the Papal office was by no means certain. In conclaves men who are considered \"papabile\" often are not elected to office. At times men considered certain to win the election did not win. This is expressed in the saying, \"He who enters the conclave as Pope leaves as a Cardinal.\"\nRatzinger was considered to be Pope John Paul II's \"right hand man\" and also one of his closest friends and confidants, and during the Pope's final illness, he carried out many of the Pope's functions as leader of the Catholic Church.\nRatzinger has repeatedly stated he would like to retire to a Bavarian village and dedicate himself to writing books, but more recently, he told friends he was ready to \"accept any charge God placed on him.\" After the death of John Paul II on April 2, 2005 Ratzinger ceased functioning as Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith.\nRatzinger speaks ten languages and has received seven honorary doctorate degrees. He is an accomplished pianist with a preference for Mozart.\nRatzinger was a member of the Hitler Youth during his teenage years, as was required by German law at the time. His father was very strongly anti-Nazi, and Ratzinger himself later deserted the German army.\nHe is the eighth German pope.\nIn April, 2005, he was identified as one of the 100 most influential people in the world by Time Magazine."}

The prize comes with an award of US$500,000, making it the largest single award for invention given in the United States.\nHypersonic Sound beams.\nHyperSonic Sound, or HSS\u00ae, has been called by MIT \"the first big improvement in acoustics since the loudspeaker was invented 80 years ago\". It represents a new way to focus audio in beams, rather like light is focused.\nHSS works because sound of sufficiently high frequency above human hearing does not normally spread out like audible frequency waves. These waves can be projected onto specific individuals, causing them to hear a sound that appears to be emanating from themselves, while others around them hear nothing.\nPotential benefits could include the reduction of noise pollution in public places. Announcements, instructions, and advertisements could be aimed at individuals, not disturbing their neighbors. People in the same room could all listen to different music without the use of headphones.\nCrank up the volume, and HSS could also be useful to military or law enforcement agencies. HSS beams can be focused up to 500 yards away, transmitting warnings or temporarily stunning and disabling a person with non-lethal force.\nAirScooter flying vehicles.\nThe AirScooter\u2122 is a flying, helicopter-like personal vehicle that is planned to be made available for sale later this year. The price is estimated to be less than US$50,000.\nWeighing less than 300 pounds and able to carry a load of an additional 350 pounds, the AirScooter runs on ordinary gasoline rather than expensive airplane fuel, and is able to travel about 2 hours at 55 m.p.h. on a 5-gallon tank, at heights up to 10,000 feet above sea level. Its ultralight weight means that no pilot license is required to fly one.\nThe light weight is made possible by the production of a new AeroTwin 4-stroke engine specifically for the AirScooter, designed by motorcycle racing engine specialists at Pearson Motor Co of New Zealand. Stability is provided by two rotors both set on a single shaft, which turn in opposite directions, eliminating the need for a tail rotor.\nThe craft is steered using only the hands on a motorcycle-like handlebar. Throttle up to gain altitude, turn left or right to rotate, and move the bars like a joystick to steer in different directions, including reverse.\nPictures and video of the new craft are available from the AirScooter.com website.\nWoody Norris.\nNorris is a self-educated, independent inventor with boundless curiosity who never made it out of the 3rd grade in traditional schooling. He has been developing inventions for more than 30 years, particularly in audio technology, since taking apart his family's radio at the age of 8. He is 63 years old and has 11 children.\nPart of the reason Norris was selected for the prize is his commitment to inspiring others. \u201cThere are classes to inventing. It isn't limited to science and technology. Writers, actors, cooks and artists are all inventors,\u201d Norris says. \u201cPeople need to be encouraged to go out there and pursue the fields that will help them create the wonderful things they are capable of achieving.\u201d\nNorris plans to use the prize money to establish a foundation to help other struggling, independent inventors like himself."}

The \"Imitation Game\", based on the original Turing model for testing the ability of humans to recognize artificial intelligence (AI), was carried out with nearly eighty human and AI participants.\nThe 'Original Imitation Game' is described in Turing's 1950 . A popularized version now dubbed the \"\" involves a judge knowingly interviewing a software program and a human person during a computer chat, and then trying to discern which is which. The Turing Test has been conducted many times as Artificial Intelligence programs developed. However, no study was ever published following the guidelines of the original thought-experiment itself.\nThe Imitation Game involved playing a \"gender guessing game\", wherein two human subjects, a male and a female, communicate via computer chat to the judge. Both the male and the female would try to convince the judge that s/he is female. Turing's original question was, if a gender guessing game were done with two humans, and then with an AI replacing the male, would the judge be more accurate in guessing who the real female was?\nThree students at Simon's Rock \u2014 Cameo Wood, Melissa Leventhal, and Allyson Sgro \u2014 wrote a grant to support the experiment, and shepherded the proposal through the Human Research Review Committee under the oversight of Professor Anne O'Dwyer. The experiment was funded by the departments of Natural Science and the department of Social Science at the college.\nThe experiment utilized a program called A.L.I.C.E., which is designed to hold one end of an interactive conversation. The program was provided by the ALICE Artificial Intelligence Foundation. Dr. Richard Wallace was on hand during the experiment to troubleshoot the AI robot, later gave a lecture about on The Anatomy of A.L.I.C.E. and blogged the event.\nSix human subjects from Simon's Rock composed the human players in the game; the judges were recruited from various non-technical internet communities. Roughly eighty individuals participated in the experiment, which required the organizers to maintain strict secrecy about the experiment until it was concluded. All subjects who participated in the experiment were required to be over 18, not affiliated with the college, and were not allowed any foreknowledge of the use of AI in the experiment. Roughly 70 interviews were conducted over a three hour period last Saturday, via , a messaging tool that allows individuals to write to one another online.\nThe research team at Simon's Rock has started to analyze the data they acquired during the experiment and will be writing a paper for publication in the coming months. Inquiries regarding the experiment may be directed to researcher@theguessinggame.net."}

This was due to economic disputes, as well as a dispute over Ukraine's construction of the Bastroe Channel, which was to be built a few kilometres north of the Romanian border. The Bastroe Channel was opposed by Romania on the grounds that it would damage the Danube Delta ecosystem, affecting Romania's environment. Romania's point of view towards the project was also supported by the European Union and several environmental organisations worldwide.\nHowever, when President Yushchenko was sworn in during the Orange Revolution last year, the two countries gradually improved ties, especially since B\u0103sescu focussed more on the Black Sea region than his predecessor, Ion Illiescu, and said that Romania and Ukraine would try to reach an agreement on their problems without going to international courts."}

The funds come in response to a request sent at the beginning of this year by the Arad municipal government.\nThe mayor of Arad, Gheorge Falc\u0103, said that the modernisation was necessary because, up until now, apartments in the area could not be properly heated due to a significant loss of hot water caused by problems in the pipe network. According to the mayor, the installations will be fully modernised by this winter (December 2005). Falc\u0103 also added that, in years to come, he would request more funds from the national government in order to modernise all out-of-date power plants in the city, and therefore reduce the costs for consumers.\nAt the same time, the Romanian government has pledged to reduce pollution levels, especially in industrial cities like Arad, in order to comply with European Union environmental standards. Romania is set to join the EU in 2007. The government's target is that, by 2015, all plants or facilities using large combustion installations will have to align to EU environmental standards or will be forced to shut down. One of such plants is the Arad District Heating Plant, CET Arad, which is going to be modernised in the future. The modernisation is expected to take 100 million euros to complete."}

The fragments were unearthed near the buried town of Oxyrhynchus, Egypt in a major archaeological find a century ago. Many of the fragments were unable to be read until now.\nMulti-Spectral Imaging.\nMulti-Spectral Imaging (MSI) is based on technology originally developed by NASA to photograph features of other worlds in bands beyond the visible spectrum, both infrared and ultraviolet. The technology was adapted by researchers at Brigham Young University to filter a narrow bandwidth of infrared light, which reacts with ink but not the surrounding material, making the writing stand out more easily and plainly than before and enabling non-destructive photographs of formerly invisible text to be taken.\nMSI was successfully used in 1999 to read many of the Herculaneum Scrolls, which were considered to be blank or charred beyond recognition until then. Herculaneum was a town in ancient Italy that was buried next to Pompeii in its volcanic eruption of 79 AD, leaving many scrolls damaged but naturally preserved.\nOxyrhynchus.\nOxyrhynchus, whose name means \"sharp-nose\", was a town located along a tributary of the Nile in ancient Egypt and populated largely by Greek immigrants. The name refers to a river-dwelling fish with a long snout that was worshiped as the town's patron deity by a local cult.\nIn between the town's surrounding wall and the local farmlands, there developed a number of dumping sites for papyrus and other materials, many of which have survived to the present day buried under mounds of sand because of dry, rainless local conditions. Papyrus, a paper-like writing surface made from reeds along the Nile river, normally does not last and no actual books written on ancient papyri have been uncovered.\nThe site was explored in the late 19th century by Bernard Grenfell and Arthur Hunt of Oxford University, during which about 100,000 fragments of papyrus were unearthed, which today are stored at Sackler Library, Oxford, in the largest collection of its kind in the world.\nClassical and Christian Writings.\nOxyrhynchus was not noted as a center of learning, and 90% of the fragments found there are expected to be mundane yet useful in reconstructing ancient daily life, including such things as \"codes, edicts, registers, official correspondence, census-returns, tax-assessments, petitions, court-records; sales, leases, wills, bills, accounts, inventories, horoscopes, [and] private letters\". According to researchers on the project, \"the mass of unedited material represents the random waste-paper of seven centuries of Greco-Egyptian life.\"\nThe remaining 10% could possibly contain unknown portions of literary classics of Greek and Roman antiquity, or even lost Christian gospel copies or apocryphal writings. Among the items currently being worked on are parts of a play by Sophocles, a lost novel by Lucian, mythological poetry by Parthenius of Nicaea, an elegiac poem by Archilochus, and other writings by Euripides and Hesiod.\nGiven that Oxyrhynchus was also the site of a discovery of portions of the Gospel of Thomas (although that discovery was later overshadowed by the discovery of a more complete copy among the Dead Sea Scrolls), many classical scholars are excited by the new discoveries.\n\u201cThe Oxyrhynchus collection is of unparalleled importance \u2014 especially now that it can be read fully and relatively quickly,\u201d said Dr. Dirk Obbink of Oxford, who is leading the imaging project. \u201cThe material will shed light on virtually every aspect of life in Hellenistic and Roman Egypt and, by extension, in the classical world as a whole.\u201d\nThe amount of new material, estimated to be around 5 million words, could expand the entire storehouse of classical writings by as much as 20%.\nDigital photographs of some of the writings are expected to be published as early as next month; given the number of fragments, the effort in documenting and preserving them may continue as long as the next decade.\nSources.\nMistakes seem to exist in some of the sources, see notes below.\nNotes regarding sources.\nSeveral mistakes seem to exist in the sources.\n1 \"Scotsman News' headline: \"'Lost' classical manuscripts give up their secrets after 9,000 years\" \n2 Date range the papyri were supposed to have been deposited, given by \"Scotsman News\", \"Sci-Tech Today\" as \"3rd to 7th centuries BC\".\n3 A third possible error concerns the number of fragments, as stated in the Independent's article, \"Scientists begin...\", which quoted a figure of 400,000 fragments.\nIn conclusion, as classical authors themselves might have once said, \"Caveat lector\" (let the reader beware).\nExternal Links.\n \n "}

Fisheries Minister, Ian Macdonald, told the nation's \"ABC Radio\" that a number of boats caught fishing for shark fin and reef fish had been taken to Gove and Darwin.\nThe nine-day joint navy, customs and army \"Operation Clearwater\" was continuing, and had taken months to plan.\n\"I think all of the illegal vessels up there, because of their inter-vessel communication will now be aware that there is a major sting on by the Australian authorities and those that haven't been arrested, I think will be hightailing it back to Indonesian ports as we speak,\" said Senator MacDonald.\nIntelligence indicated what he called \"organised transnational criminal activity\", including some Asian connections beyond the Indonesian village ports where the vessels originated, but the activity was apparently limited to illegal fishing, and did not include smuggling.\n\"We are talking about large-scale commercial operations rather than simply subsistence fishing,\" Macdonald said in a statement, indicating that fifteen of the boats were large vessels with ice for storage. Two boats each had one tonne of fish, and shark fin.\nFishing by some Indonesian peoples has occurred legitimately in the area between the two nations for hundreds of years before European colonization. A 1906 Australian claim on as much as 80% of the waters has since been softened by a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the two governments, recognizing some traditional fishing rights.\nHowever analysts say the Australian government strategy is flawed, since it is based on the fishing technology employed, rather than catch numbers. \nAt time of writing, it has not been ascertained whether the currently detained vessels were fishing in such \"traditional\" waters or not, or whether they were operated by crews who would have traditional fishing rights, if they had been in compliance with the MOU.\nSenator MacDonald told the \"ABC Radio\" programme \"AM\" that he expected in the case of those thought to have been fishing in Australian waters illegally, the captain and perhaps the senior fishing master would be charged, with other crew being immediately repatriated to Indonesia.\nAs for the boats, \"We're required by international law to offer them to bond them back to the owners, but as the crew are immediately repatriated the ability of the owners to get them back to Indonesia ... is fairly limited,\" the Senator explained.\n\"I would expect that most of these boats apprehended in operation Clearwater will actually be forfeited to the crown and will be destroyed.\"\nThe fishermen were expected to appear in court next week, reported \"Reuters\" news agency. An Indonesian fisherman was last week fined $A130,000, setting a new record, after his boat was caught off with over 100kg of dried reef fish, 300kg of fish on ice and 10kg of dried shark fin.\nThe Northern Territory Fisheries Minister, Kon Vatskalis, on \"ABC Radio\" asked the Federal Government to commit the same level of resources permanently.\n\"Provide the extra funding, provide the extra resources to the Navy and the Customs and then they will be able to stop the illegal boats, not only when they run an operation but every day, every week, every month,\" Mr Vatskalis told the ABC.\nSee also.\n "}

Vice-President Alfredo Palacio was voted in unanimously by deputies to replace Mr Gutierrez who is accused of abandoning his post. \nThe \"BBC\" reports Gutierrez left the presidential palace by helicopter after sparking protests when he tried to overhaul the Supreme Court. He is now in the Brazilian embassy in Quito where he has applied for asylum (www.planetmafia.net), as confirmed by the Brazilian department of foreign affairs.\nIn the worst political turmoil experienced in Quito in nearly a century, panic is evident. Many families have rushed to supermarkets to stock up in anticipation of further violence. The cause of this panic is the sudden escalation of violence in the protests and anti-government demonstrations that have been underway for a week. \nProtests began as a reaction to the government\u2019s unconstitutional appointment of a partisan Supreme Court. Last week, the inability of the Congress to resolve the problem led broadcaster \"Radio La Luna\" to call for a spontaneous demonstration against the government by the citizenry, without the intervention of politicians. The success of this demonstration caused it to be repeated each night when thousands of people went into the streets singing and banging on kitchenware. \nOn Friday, President Gutierrez, a self proclaimed \"dictocrat\" (dictator for the opposition but democrat to his supporters), declared a state of emergency in Quito, and suspended all civil liberties in the capital. (In the past, this president has not shown himself to be a friend of the constitutional order, and was part of a 2001 coup which overthrew President Jamil Mahuad). The president sent armed forces to shut down \"Radio La Luna\", but when the troops were met by thousands of unarmed civilians, they stepped down. The President was forced to cancel the state of emergency within 24 hours given the tumultuous uproar.\nThe government instead called its supporters from the provinces to come to Quito and fight the protesters in the streets. Renan Borbua, one of the President's staunchest allies in Guayaquil, announced that buses packed with cudgel and machete-wielding thugs were on their way to Quito. Quito\u2019s Mayor Paco Moncayo, and the prefect of Pichincha declared the highways closed and refused the \u2018thugs\u2019 a way into Quito. Nonetheless many government sympathizers were reported near the capital, looting stores and destroying parked automobiles.\nThe government also ordered the National Police to suppress the protesters, a move leading Quito\u2019s mayor to declare that the National Police were no longer viewed as legitimate in the city. Also as a response to the President\u2019s order, the Commander of the National Police resigned in protest, but was promptly replaced by the President\u2019s own cousin.

Fishermen are entitled to harpoon up to 797 whales before the end of the season on August 31st.\nLast years quota of 670 was raised this year despite fishermen failing to reach their quota last year. Environmental activists from groups such as Greenpeace have denounced the increase. Speaking to the Associated Press, one activist said \"Increased whaling is no solution for the problems along the coast.\" However despite international opposition, it is unlikely Norway will end whaling anytime soon.\nNorway is the only country in the world to allow commercial whaling. Iceland and Japan do so solely on a research basis. Whale meat is used as steaks and in hamburgers and sausages in Norway. The number of whales caught by Norway has steadily increased since resumption of whaling in 1993, with the 226 caught that year rising to over 500 in 1997 and 670 in 2003.\nThe economic argument is that whaling provides employment and economic stimulant for fishery, logistic, restaurant and other related industries in developed countries. However many countries continue to argue that, if properly developed, whale-watching could be far more profitable and create far more jobs than whale killing."}

The resulting explosion killed two policemen and wounded at least one other, and was large enough to damage some nearby homes.\nThis news follows a different assassination attempt on April 12 last week against Iraq's Deputy Interior Minister Tariq al-Baldawi by gunmen in two cars who attacked his convoy; al-Baldawi escaped without harm in that attack.\nIn addition, three other car bombs are known to have been set off in the area of the Iraqi capital during the same day. Targets included a US military convoy, a police station, and a police patrol, resulting in the wounding of more than a dozen civilians and the deaths of two victims, including one child, according to sources reported by the Australian.\nThis is the fifth assassination attempt on Allawi himself. Previous attempts on Allawi have included a violent attack in 1978 by an axe-wielding intruder in his home believed to have been instigated by Saddam Hussein, which nearly severed Allawi's leg at the knee and also injured the arm of his wife, who was sleeping.\nAllawi has received criticism from various groups in the past related to his activities on behalf of the American-appointed Interim Governing Council of Iraq.\nLast year, militants under the leadership of alleged al-Qaida operative Abu Musab al-Zarqawi offered $285,000 for the killing of Allawi, which may or may not be related to the most recent attack."}

Ancestral domain refers to territories claimed to be inhabited by the ancestors of indigenous peoples, and was discussed by the two groups in terms of concept, territory, governance, and resources.

This area could include as much as one-third of the Philippines.\nThis meeting was the seventh in a series of GRP-MLF Exploratory Talks, and the first to result in a breakthrough on substantive issues not related to immediate security concerns. \nFurther talks are planned for next month in Malaysia, but full resolution of the conflict is not expected at least until peace talks begin in June.

Bush signed into law Wednesday a major bankruptcy reform bill, making the most sweeping changes to the laws of personal bankruptcy in the past two decades. Bill S.256 is predicted to reduce the chances of filing Chapter 7 bankruptcy for 30,000 to 210,000 families per year, according to the American Bankruptcy Institute.\nThe legislation was strongly opposed by some consumer advocates and by some Democrats in Congress, who complained about the lack of debate on exemptions they attempted to introduce and tried to derail the passage of the bill. Those who are unable to file for Chapter 7 bankruptcy will then be forced to file under Chapter 13, which requires payment of some debts by order of a judge based on the financial resources of the debtor.\nOpponents said the bill will end a chance for a fresh start in the financial lives of the American people by keeping them in debt to collection agencies, as well as credit card companies and banks who have made it easy to obtain high credit limits amid mounting consumer debt.\nIn his remarks before signing the bill, which he supported, Bush said, \"The bipartisan bill I'm\nabout to sign makes common-sense reforms to our bankruptcy laws. By restoring\nintegrity to the bankruptcy process, this law will make our financial system\nstronger and better. By making the system fairer for creditors and debtors,\nwe will ensure that more Americans can get access to affordable credit.\"\nThe bankruptcy bill received a 302-126 approval in the house, after receiving a 74-25 vote in the Senate last month following strong, mostly partisan debate.\nThe US bankruptcy system was established in 1898. It allowed judges and debtors to come to terms with the costly medical bills that can follow a relative's death, or a family illness. Such cases form nearly half of all bankruptcies filed in the USA, according to the American Bankruptcy Institute.\nNow many of those people will have to work out repayment plans suitable to creditors instead of having debts erased by a judge, according to the new law, which takes effect in six months.\nIn the past, a judge or court representative would calculate an individual's income and subtract necessities of life to come up with a practical repayment plan of some debt. The new law stipulates that a graph, showing the poverty level in whichever state the consumer is living will be the criteria. It assumes that if people can subsist at that poverty level, then everything over that can be used to repay creditors.\nAdditionally, a provision that allowed debtors to file their own Chapter 7 fresh start bankruptcy has been changed to require a lawyer, paid by the debtor, to do the filing.\nThe new law also erased \"\" provisions in lending laws, with some lawmakers saying that paying 30 percent interest was not too much when a debtor was behind on payments.\nBut Bush said that credit will \"be more affordable because when bankruptcy is less common, credit can be extended to more people at better rates,\" meeting demands of the credit card companies which they have been pressing for the last eight years.\n\"The big winners under the new law will be the special interests that literally wrote it, particularly the credit card industry,\" said Travis B. Plunkett, legislative director of the Consumer Federation of America. \"This is particularly ironic because reckless and abusive lending practices by credit card companies have driven many Americans to the brink of bankruptcy.\"\nThe forces arrayed on the losing side of this bill said it will hurt low-income working people, single mothers, minorities, and elderly and will end a safety net for people who have lost jobs or face major medical bills. People who fail (refuse) to pay or refuse to go to court will punished by a fine and or arrest warrant made out in their name. About fifty thousand Americans will be punished by a fine and or warrant about three thousand Americans every year will go to jail under the new bankruptcy law. For some people this will be a third strike so they will be put in jail for life.\nBut Mallory Duncan, a lawyer for the National Retail Federation, said \"Bankruptcy has gone from a stigma to a financial planning tool for many.\"\nNew personal bankruptcy filings have increased from 172,423 in 1978 to 1,599,986 last year, an increase of 828% during that time; however, it edged down slightly last year.\nAbout 2 percent to 13 percent of those who dissolve their debts in Chapter 7 bankruptcy each year in exchange for forfeiting some assets will be disqualified from doing so under the law, according to the American Bankruptcy Institute.\nBankruptcy lawyers anticipate a rush to the courthouse to beat the six-month window before the new reforms take effect."}

The study showed an increasing trend among the nation's teenagers using prescription drugs, such as Vicodin and OxyContin, to get high. Partnership Chairman Roy Bostock summarizes the results as \"the first time our national study finds that today's teens are more likely to have abused a prescription painkiller to get high than they are to have experimented with a variety of illegal drugs.

The results presented were from the 2004 Partnership Attitude Tracking Study that surveyed the nation's largest sample size ever in terms of ongoing analysis of teen drug-related attitudes: more than 7,300 teens. Studies pertaining to drugs are often flawed because of their use of a self-reporting methodology. It is very easy for participants in a non-scientific study \u2014 especially teenagers \u2014 to under, over, or misreport their data. The margin of error is plus or minus 1.5 percent.\nThe study reported that about one in five teenagers has abused a prescription painkiller \u2014 more than those who have experimented with either ecstasy, cocaine, crack or LSD. The most popular prescription drug abused by teens was Vicodin, with 18 percent (about 4.3 million youths) reporting. OxyContin, as well as drugs for attention-deficit disorder like Ritalin or Adderall, came in second place with 10 percent. One in eleven teens (2.2 million) had abused over-the-counter products such as cough medicine. Fewer than half the teens in the study (48 percent) believed experimenting with prescription drugs was a \"great risk.\" Additionally, many teens chose to use legal drugs because of \"ease of access.\"\nThe number of teens reporting marijuana use declined to 37 percent last year, compared with 42 percent six years earlier.

Already it has been attributed as one cause of the Liberal Party loss-of-majority in Parliament, after federal elections last June.\nThat report found that shortly after defeat of a 1995 separatist referendum in Quebec, millions of dollars from a government federalism advertising campaign in Quebec had been directed to specific advertising firms, friendly to the Liberal Party, reports the \"Associated Press\".\nGomery federal inquiry.\nSince a publication ban was lifted two weeks ago, on federal inquiry testimony by a Montreal advertising executive who faces fraud charges over the scandal, revelations have \"been more politically explosive than previously expected\", to quote Canada's \"CTV News\".\nAnd the opposition has been trying to draw links to Martin, who was finance minister at the time of the sponsorship program currently being examined.\nAdvertising executive Jean Brault told Justice John Gomery's federal inquiry that senior Liberals made him secretly divert more than $US818,000 to the party's Quebec wing in exchange for sponsorship contracts, reported \"The Australian\".\nBloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois Leader Gilles Duceppe said the revelations had tarnished Quebecers, reported \"CTV News\".\n\"The Liberal Party said it wanted to promote federalism.

Levan lives in Wiscasset, Maine, with her husband and daughter, and she ran in the Boston Marathon women's race on April 18, 2005.\"\nTo summarize for our readers, you recently came in 12th in the Boston Marathon, right?\nThat is correct.\nYou were the first American finisher.\nYes.\nThere was also a Russian woman who lives in the US who finished ahead of you.\nYou know, I believe it is, I'm not actually positive, but I think you're right. There's often a lot of foreign runners that live and train in different parts of the US for a variety of reasons. Some live in Colorado and might train at high altitude, or they might have coaches in the US.\nOK, but as far as you know, for straight up Americans, people who were born here, who have lived here for long periods of time and are not going anywhere special to train, you were the first finisher.\nThat is correct.\nSo congratulations, that's very impressive. In the rest of your life, my understanding is that you are going to nursing school.\nI am. I'm at the University of Southern Maine in Portland. and I have been going to nursing school for a couple years now. I'm just going part time right now because of the baby and other things going on in my world.\nYour baby is currently one and a half?\nShe's fifteen months.\nFifteen months, so one and one quarter. 1.25, sure.\nHopefully I'll finish up nursing school in December. That is the tentative plan.\nSo you're almost done.\nI just have a couple classes left.\nI'll take one class this summer and two classes in the fall.\nYou ran the Boston Marathon originally two years ago?\nActually, I ran it for the first time in 99. I've run it four times.\nI did run it two years ago as well.\nYou ran it two years ago, and you also came in twelfth then, if not the top American finisher then. You were the fourth?\nI think third or fourth. I can't remember exactly.\nHow long were you actually training for this marathon in particular?\nI'd say about 4 months. I typically try to train about four months for each race. It depends a little bit on what kind of shape I'm in leading up to the training. Four months is usually the time frame I shoot for.\nAnd how many miles a week were you doing--I assume you peaked somewhere right before the marathon.\nAt the peak, I have a month or six week period where I've built up to my peak training, and I was probably doing between 90 to 100 miles a week.\nWas there a lot of variation in your day to day mileage, or was it pretty much you're doing 1/7th of that mileage every day?\nThere's definitely variation, probably more so in the type of workout that i did each day. For example two days a week I would do a speed workout, so I might be doing mile repeats, which just means that I do a mile in a specific time, and then I might jog for a couple minutes and then another one and another one. I'd do a series of eight mile repeats on that specific workout day. My other speed workout would be a marathon pace run, so I might run 8 or 10 miles at my marathon pace. If my marathon pace is 6 minute miles, I'd do a two mile jog warm up, and then I might do 8 or 10 miles at a six minute pace, and then a two mile cool down.\nSo you maybe end up running 14?\nSometimes what I would do on those speed workout days-- on those days I might end up with about 14 miles. On some other days, I might run twice during the course of the day. Say in the morning, I might run eight miles, and then in the afternoon I might do six or eight more miles.\nWow.\nThose days tend to be a little bit more mellow. More of kind of a maintenance run, a little bit of a recovery day. I try to have a recovery day after every hard workout.\nDo you think that all of your training could fit into four hours a day? Do you think that's true?\nYou mean the workouts for a specific day? Probably even less than that. Depending on the day a little bit, probably between 2 or 3 hours. Usually on Sunday I would go out and do a long run, and that would be a 20 or 22 mile run, all in one fell swoop and that usually takes two and a half hours.\nSo that explains how you're able to do this, as well as go to nursing school, as well as have an extremely young child. I assume you talk to your friends occasionally.\nI try to at least-- have some sort of social life. This is not a job, so it's not something that I do 8 hours a day. It's something that I fit in with all the other obligations, things that I like to do too. I like to be able to pursue other interests as well.\nYou live on a road with no one else near by. Do you pretty much just run from your house every day?\nThe winter is harder because with the baby, I often end up running with a treadmill down in the basement. Brad, my husband, has pretty long hours at the farm, and especially in the winter months, it's hard to find daylight when he's able to watch Maddy, so I ended up running a lot on the treadmill this winter, as opposed to last summer, I would take her with me. I have one of those baby joggers, and that was great. I could just leave right from the house, and I could take her. She would be pretty happy to go eight or ten miles with me. Typically what I do when I go outside, I just go right from the house. The roads are so pretty around here. We're pretty secluded, so I don't have to worry too much about crazy drivers.\nDo you ever try to go find big hills to run up and down?\nI do. In the past, I have done a hill workout as a part of my training, usually early on in the training during the first six weeks or 2 months of the training I do a hill workout and I would find some place close by that I could find a warm up jog and run to and then do a hill workout. If I couldn't find one within a couple miles, I would drive to it. It's a little bit harder now with Maddy because I don't have as much leeway and freedom with when I go running and where I go running. I'm a little more limited.\nYou'd have to load up the cart, er, the carriage into the car.\nI've done that sometimes. Sometimes it's easier to go straight from home.\nRunning with the jogger up hills is not an easy thing to do.\nWhen you're in the race, you feel like, \u201cHey, I'm not even pushing a kid anymore.\u201d Heartbreak Hill without the kid is substantially easier, I suppose.\nYeah.\nDo you know most of the elite runners in the race? You know who they are, but are you friends with them, or not really?\nIt's funny--I know who people are, but I don't run that many races to really get to know that many of the runners. If you're a professional runner, and that's your job, a lot of those people travel in the same circles. They run the same races and they have the same schedules in terms of when they compete. I pick out a couple of races each year to focus on and because of that, I don't get to know as many of the runners. As time goes on, you do get a little bit you do get a little more familiar with people.\nDuring the race, do you talk to the other runners, or do you just run along and think things like, \u201cI wish I were at the end right now\u201d?\nI think that really depends I find that if I'm feeling good and the run is going well, then it's easier for me to talk to people, just because you're feeling strong, and you're not focusing so much on \u201cI'm not doing so great.\u201d I might talk to some folks along the way. Sometimes if someone passes me, I'll encourage them and say \u201cGood job, go get them,\u201d and just stuff like that. I certainly find I'm not carrying on lengthy conversations with people because you're expending energy that should be focused on the race itself. I enjoy getting to know folks along the way and knowing what pace they're hoping to run.\nIn races other than the Boston Marathon do you find that you have good competition? I don't really know what the running scene in Wiscasset, Maine, is like at all, but I imagine that being the fastest female marathon runner in the United States, you might not find a whole lot of competition. You say that you encourage people when they pass you, but having read some of the other interviews with you on the web, it doesn't seem like people pass you very often.\nIt definitely depends on the race. Like I said before, I don't run that many races. At this point, what I'm trying to do is to find races that are competitive so I can be pushed by competition. For example, when I ran the Maine Marathon last fall, there wasn't a whole lot of competition. That just gets hard. I ran alone for most of the race. Running 26 miles at a fast pace all by yourself without anyone around you to help push you and motivate you, can be pretty hard. Because of that, as I've been looking toward the future and thinking about which races I want to do, I've been targeting races that will have a little more competition. That's why Boston was one that I wanted to shoot for and I'm thinking about in the fall going to Chicago because they've got a pretty competitive marathon. It's also a pretty flat course, so people tend to run pretty fast times there.\nMost people run a couple of minutes faster in Chicago, right?\nYeah, exactly. And I've heard good things about the race too, so I'm looking forward to that.\nHave you thought about running internationally?\nNot at this point, no. It's hard to find the time to travel to races, and It gets expensive too. A lot of my family members say, \u201cWouldn't it be great to do the London Marathon or the Paris Marathon,\u201d because they like coming to watch. At this point, I think I'm going to stick closer to home. I've got a few races, like I was mentioning Chicago, here in the States that I'd really like to do. Maybe once I've done those, I might think about something else, it really just depends. A lot of it's a time issue, because I have other things that I'm pursuing and it gets hard to spend too much time traveling off doing different races.\nDo you know Alan Culpepper?\nOh, yeah, yeah.\nYou at least know of him, right?\nYes, exactly.\nHave you ever been in any races against him?\nThis was the first race that I had run in that he ran in. He was the fourth overall male finisher. That's a really good showing for an American male. I've read a lot about him in different running magazines and just heard a lot about him through running circles.\nBut this was the first time that I've actually seen him run. It was neat because in this particular race, they start the women's elite group about 25 minutes ahead of the rest of the start.\n29 minutes actually, I believe.\nThat's right, 29 minutes. So, I didn't see a male runner until pretty close to the end, so it was really neat to see--I think I saw the top five male finishers because they passed me in the last couple miles. It was really interesting--there's all these cars and press and motorcycles, policemen, so I could tell when the first male was coming up behind me because there was a lot more going on on the course. Alan Culpepper was one of the ones that passed me in the last mile or two. It was pretty neat to see him finishing strong.\nYou might not be able to beat him in a race but do you think you could maybe, I don't know, beat him in a fist fight? He's pretty skinny, right? He only weighs 130 pounds.\nI don't know. I don't know. I wouldn't make any bets on it at this point.\nNo?\nNo.\nOK. Have you thought about doing things longer than a marathon? Like a 50 K or a 100 K?\nAt this point, I haven't because I've gotten into the marathon, and I've really been enjoying that so far. I feel like I still have some room to improve and grow in the marathon, but I think at some point I'd really like to do one of those ultra-type races. For the next several years, I'll stick towards the marathon distances. Once that competitive part of my life is over, I might move on to something different.\nBased on your age, are you likely to peak around now, or you maybe have a few years to go before your legs start to fall off?\nBefore I can't walk anymore? I don't know. It's really interesting because for marathoning you've got a longer life span than in a lot of competitive sports. The fifth place female finisher in Boston this year was over forty. You can still be competitive into your forties. I'm not sure if I'll keep doing it that long-- at least another 3 years or so. One thing in the back of my mind looking at is the Olympic Trials for 2008. I'm looking at that time frame right now. If I want to keep running competitively after that, then I'll assess things from there.\nThat sounds good. When you came in as the first American finisher, did you get any certificates or cash or a medal or anything like that?\nYeah, actually, I won $2100.\nOh, great-- two thousand bucks!\nWhich is pretty nice.\nThat's a lot of baby clothes.\nI know-- or a lot of shoes. The shoe expense is pretty expensive, and I've been trying to find a shoe company that might give me some shoes.\nI would think--couldn't you just call up New Balance and say, \u201cHey, look, I'm pretty good, why don't you give me some shoes?\u201d\nWell, this past November, after I ran New York-- I usually wear Asics or New Balance-- I wrote to both of those companies. I sent them a little running resume. I said I'd be interested in pursuing some sort of sponsorship opportunity, and they both wrote back and said, \u201cSorry, we don't have any space or funds available at this time.\u201d I was a little disappointed by that, because I was hoping to at least get someone to help me out with my shoes.\nYeah, at least some sneakers.\nBut in addition at Boston, they do have these crystal vases that they give out for the top 15 finishers, so I got a little piece of hardware there too.\nSo you get to put flowers in that.\nI had some flowers in it; they've wilted so I decided to compost them.\nOh, that's good.\nYeah, send them back to the earth, you know.\nHas anyone else tried to interview you? Local paparazzi following you?\nI hide in my car for most of the day. I did some local interviews--with the local NBC affiliate, and I'm going to do an interview tomorrow with the ABC affiliate in Portland, and some affiliated newspaper interviews as well.\nYou're officially famous, then.\nI don't know. I guess. It's been pretty busy.\nHas anyone asked you for an autograph yet?\nNo. No autograph seekers yet, no.\nMaybe in the Yellowfront Grocery in Wiscasset? \u201cHey, I know you!\u201d\n\u201cI saw you on TV!\u201d No, not yet.\nThat's surely coming. The Chewonki Foundation, which is where you live, recently had Eaton Farm donated to it.\nYes.\nAnd they're planning on making a 12 mile long trail that runs from approximately your house to Wiscasset.\nOh, you know more about this than I do, that's great.\nI don't know if it's going to start right at your front door; you might have to cut through the woods a little bit.\nThat's OK, I can do that.\nHave you run on trails at all, or is it just, \u201cI want to run on the pavement because I don't want to twist an ankle\u201d?\nI'm not a big trail runner. Maybe it's because I'm not used to running on trails. Now it would be much more difficult, because I have the baby with me. The baby jogger has some nice wheels on it, but I don't know if it could handle trail running.\nYeah.\nIt's a nice change of pace every once in a while. I don't worry too much about twisting an ankle--you just have to be careful. I figure I can walk out my door and step in a pothole and twist my ankle, so I don't worry too much about that. That goes along with being alive in our world. We'll see. I'm going to have to look into that 12 mile trail.\nBecause 12 miles, you do that there and back, you've got a marathon on your hands.\nThere you go.\nWhat's your next target? Can you walk right now?\nIf I train well, I'm usually not sore. Especially on the long runs, my body gets used to running for that length of time and sure, I'm running faster during the marathon than I do on my long runs, but I think my body tends to adjust to the rigors. It's usually a good sign if a few days afterwards I don't have any major soreness. I certainly feel like I've done something significant.\nYeah, I can imagine feeling too.\nNo major aches or pains.\nThat's great. What's your next race? Do you have one targeted? Is it Chicago?\nYeah, I think the next marathon will be Chicago in the fall. there's a 10 K race, the Beach to Beacon, you may have heard of it.\nIn Portland?\nIt's actually in Cape Elizabeth. It's put on by Joan Benoit Samuelson. It's in August, so I'll probably do that one and then shoot for the fall marathon.\nWell, I think that's all my questions.\nNice, well, thanks for calling. I appreciate it.\nSure, well, thanks for running so fast.\nNo problem."}

With only a handful of seats left to declare, Labour reached the 324 seats necessary to form a majority in the House of Commons, with the result in Corby at 03:28 UTC.\nThe Conservative Party remains the Opposition party, with the Liberal Democrats being the third largest party in the House of Commons.\nBoth the Labour victory and the reduced majority were widely predicted by opinion polls before the election. The BBC/ITV exit poll predicted Tony Blair a majority of 66 seats, which continued to be forecast as the final result as declarations were made. Some early results in the north-east indicated a bigger swing away from Labour than the opinion polls had been suggesting, but later results confirmed the survey.\nOverall, there has been no clear swing in votes between the parties. Many seats have seen large swings, but in many different directions, with perhaps the national swing of 5% from Conservative to Liberal Democrat being the most dramatic with many much larger local swings.\nThe new Labour government has been elected with the lowest proportion of the popular vote ever - just 35.2%. However, the Tories only gained 32.3% barely more than the last election in 2001. The biggest winners in terms of popular vote were the Liberal Democrats led by Charles Kennedy, who secured 22.1% of the vote. With 645 of 646 seats declared so far, this has given the Liberal Democrats another 11 seats in Parliament, but the Conservatives have gained another 33 seats. Labour have lost 47.\nAs a result, Tony Blair is forecast to be governing with a majority of 66 in the new Parliament. However, on some major issues such as university fees and anti-terror laws, many Labour MPs have voted against their leadership. With a greatly reduced majority, Tony Blair may be forced to water down many more controversial policies in order to guarantee their passage through the House of Commons. Speaking on BBC News, commentator David Dimbleby pointed out the uncertainty of such possibilities, and noted that a majority of 66 was larger than the 43 seat majority won by Margaret Thatcher in the United Kingdom general election, 1979.\nOne surprise vote was the election of ex-Labour member George Galloway in Bethnal Green &amp; Bow, in East London. The area has a very high number of Muslims in it, and Galloway moved from his home in Scotland in order to gain their anti-war support. He ousted Britain's only second female black MP, Oona King, in the process.\nRobert Kilroy-Silk, the ex-talkshow host who was sacked from the BBC after writing racist newspaper articles, only came fourth in his election in Erewash in the East Midlands. His party, Veritas, which fielded 65 candidates across the country, stood for withdrawing from the European Union and blocking immigration.\nTurnout in the general election is 60%, up 2% on 2001.\nThe race to declare.\nIn every General Election there is an informal race amongst the constituencies to declare a result first. \nFor comparison:\nTimetable for the new Parliament.\nThe new Parliament met on Wednesday May 11. Its first business was the election of the Speaker. Michael Martin was re-elected. \nThe State Opening of Parliament is scheduled to be on Tuesday May 17.\nElection results in depth.\nResults by constituency.\nNorthern Ireland.\nCounting in Northern Ireland is not performed overnight, as in the rest of the United Kingdom, but instead is performed the next day. Counts began at 09:00 BST."}

She is being held under a $500,000 arrest warrant.\nChief Rob Davis describes the case as a CSI-type operation where forensics studying the finger found it to be inconsistent with conditions it would have experienced if it were cooked at 170 degrees for 3 hours according to Wendy's food preparation standards. The loss in sales due to negative publicity for the chain could range into the millions, a loss for which Ayala could be held criminally responsible. Davis said, \"... evidence suggests that the truest victims in this case are the Wendy's owner, operators and employees here in San Jose, who have suffered financially throughout this investigation.\"\nPrior to her arrest, Wendy's had recently concluded its own internal investigation that turned up nothing to explain the source of the finger. The San Jose police, who have not accused Ayala, 39, of planting the finger herself, did search her home on April 6 for evidence relating to a possible hoax. There are no reports evidence was found. \nShe has a history of filing suits for financial settlements. Cases involve the El Pollo Loco chicken chain over a claim her daughter got sick, a sexual harassment suit against her former boss in 1998, and General Motors in 2000. A total of 13 lawsuits in California and Nevada had been filed.\nThere is an inconsistency in the Ayala account of finding the finger and claiming it caused her to vomit compared with police saying there was no vomit at the scene. One larceny charge concerns $11,000 from the sale of a mobile home owned by her live-in boyfriend. \nThe two combined charges, which could result in a possible 6-year prison term, are against the backdrop of the Wendy's chain offering a reward for information to solve the case, which has cost the chain millions of sales."}

A pregnancy rate of 13 to 16% is expected from a year of \"typical use\" as a standalone method of birth control. The product varies in effectiveness depending on if the woman forgets to insert the device before intercourse, uses the device incorrectly, or fails to wait at least 6 hours after intercourse before removing the device.\nHistory of the Today Sponge.\nThe sponge was invented by Bruce Vorhauer, PhD to combine a safe, widely used spermicide, nonoxynol-9 (N-9), and a barrier contraceptive, made from polyurethane. Since being brought to market in 1983, it quickly established itself as the best-selling contraceptive for women. More than 250 million Today Sponges were sold until March, 1994, when manufacturer American Home Products ceased making the sponge.\nSome misconceptions have surrounded the product's withdrawal, such as the sponge was found to be unsafe by the FDA (false), or that the company making it went bankrupt (also false). What happened is that the FDA inspected the only plant where the sponge was manufactured, in Hammonton, New Jersey, and discovered bacterial contamination of the water supply and other concerns.\nAmerican Home Products, which today is known as Wyeth, decided to cease manufacture rather than undergo the potential cost and delay of upgrading their plant and meantime losing share to their competitors.\nThe passing of the sponge era was noted in the famous episode of the TV show Seinfeld (Season 7, Episode 119: \"The Sponge\"). Character Elaine Benes hoarded her sponges as the supply started to dwindle, and began to examine her potential lovers to see which one of them was truly \"spongeworthy\".\nReintroduced to Canada, US.\nThe President and Chief Executive of Allen Pharmaceuticals, Gene Detroyer, bought the Today Sponge from Wyeth in 2000 for US$7 million and prepared new packaging to meet updated requirements. However, re-introduction of the product was delayed by several years, at least partly due to FDA inaction in inspecting the new manufacturing plant.\n\"I'm overwhelmed,\" said Detroyer to the Associated Press. \"I am pleased both from a business point of view ... and from the point of view that we can add another contraceptive for women.\" The Today Sponge received FDA approval in March 2003 to be sold in Canada, and some women even in the US have been able to purchase it through Canadian websites. The FDA has in the past received criticism for its role in removing the Today Sponge from the market and it continues to receive criticism for the impact of its regulatory actions on women's health.\nDespite its decade-long absence from public availability, \"The product was found to be safe and effective,\" said FDA spokesperson Susan Cruzan about its recent re-approval."}

Children fostered currently to same-sex households would be removed from their foster-parent's care.\n\"Some of us believe they would be better off in orphanages than in a homosexual or bisexual households because that's a learned behavior,\" the Republican congressman said.\nThere are reportedly thousands of children in same-sex households in Texas who would be removed, if this bill is passed.\n\"It's very traumatic to remove a child from a stable home,\" said Colin Cunliff, field director for the Lesbian/Gay Rights Lobby of Texas. \"It's the whole reason they're in the foster system, because their prior home wasn't stable. You're adding to the instability.\"\nAccording to a 2002 report by the American Academy of Pediatrics, children with homosexual parents have the \"same advantages and the same expectations for health, adjustment and development as children whose parents are heterosexual.\"\nA similar law passed in Arkansas was ruled unconstitutional in December."}

It was found for sale as meat at a marketplace in Laos. The researchers brought it to London for a closer look at its skeleton and DNA.\nResearchers found that the specimen was not particularly related to anything currently known. The group had to describe a new family of mammals for this single species. The last time a new mammal family was created to accommodate a new species discovery was in 1974 when the bumblebee bat was discovered.\nThe closest relatives to Laotian rock rats are a group of rodents that includes porcupines and guinea pigs, but this relationship is a rather distant one. The researchers think the Laotian rock rats may have split off from common ancestors a long time ago, with porcupines and guinea pigs evolving after that split.\nThe authors hope that by studying Laotian rock rats, they can solve an old puzzle. How did guinea pigs and their relatives get to South America at a time when it was surrounded by water? Until these rock rats came along, the only Old World relatives of guinea pigs were ones found in Africa or both Africa and Asia. This led some scientists to think that guinea pig ancestors got to South America from Africa across the Atlantic Ocean. Others insisted that they went through Asia and North America first. Understanding how the guinea pig's new Asian relative is connected to the rest of the family may help to explain this mystery."}

He was surrounded by his family, who had been summoned yesterday by Lady Flo, his wife and one-time Senator, for final goodbyes.\nPhrases such as \"Don't you worry about that\" and \"Goodness gracious me\" were like trademarks to the maverick leader.\nKnown simply as 'Joh' to many, he would famously describe press conferences as 'feeding the chooks'. Today Kingaroy locals taunted waiting press with cries from \"You're chooks, you're chooks, ha ha\" to \"Go home, ya vultures\", and some obscenities, reported the \"Courier-Mail\" of Brisbane.\nHis fall from power at the end of the 80s was surrounded in controversy, with the state embroiled in corruption findings going to the level of his deputies, and Bjelke Petersen's claims of ignorance coming under challenge with charges of perjury. The case was never heard due to a controversial hung jury: the foreman of the jury, Luke Shaw, had been an office-bearer of the Young Nationals \u2014 an arm of Bjelke Petersen's National Party \u2014 as well as a member of a group calling themselves 'Friends of Joh'.\nHaving had his start in life as a peanut farmer in remote Kingaroy, the former Premier was fit up until the very end, but palsy was paralyzing his muscles and organs, to which he eventually succumbed.\n\"Throughout his life Sir Joh combined enormous energy, vision and an immense capacity for hard work, most especially during his 19-year term as Premier of Queensland,\" the Governor General said.\n\"What looked to us to be huge risks at the time turned out to be nation building,\" said Bob Katter, a former minister of Joh's Government, who credited Sir Joh with starting the Queensland coal, aluminum and tourism industries.\nHe is also remembered for dismantling many of the State's unions, and for a somewhat totalitarian and heavy handed style of keeping control.\nUnder Joh, street protests were banned and Special Branch monitored extensively those the authoritarian leader saw as subversives, measures prompting Queenslander, Australian Civil Liberties Council, Terry O'Gorman, to comment Sir Joh was \"the most appalling premier Queensland has ever had in terms of civil liberties and human rights\".\nJoh was also influential in the famous case of the Dismissal by the Governor General of then-Prime Minister Gough Whitlam, in 1975.\nIn his last years as Premier, he had taken his cause to the nation's capital, with the \"Joh for PM\" campaign. But this distraction has been credited with the downfall of his government, with corruption investigations at last being conducted by his stand-in, Bill Gunn.\nThe body of Sir Joh, who was of Lutheran faith, is to be buried at Bethany, the family property near Kingaroy.\nUnsolicited quotes from ordinary Australians, many ex-Queenslanders seeking refuge in southern states, on hearing the news:\n\"Outrageous bastard!

While there have been fewer sightings of \"liberty toast\" in recent months, from discussions with students in both the U.S. and France, this reporter found that America's perception of the French remains a hot topic of discussion on college campuses.\nBryan Doeg, a military science student at the University of Central Florida, outlined the two prevailing thoughts that are the basis for many of these anti-French sentiments.\n\"Most of my fellow students feel that the French are politically and militarily weak,\" said Doeg. \"And their people are stuck up.\"\nDoeg believes that he and his classmates are not without reason for their perceptions about the French.\n\"They are weak because of France's decline in power over the last century and it's defeats against the Germans and Algerians,\" Doeg said. \"And most of my experiences regarding their arrogance comes from soldiers who visited France and were treated like untouchables by the locals.\"\nSouthwest Missouri State (SMS) finance major, Fabian Florant, got straight to the point when discussing Doeg's first assumption that the French are weak.\n\"Americans hate the French with a passion because of World War I and II,\" Florant said.\nHowever some students pointed to France's involvement in the American Revolution, questioning how long America's memory really is.\nJessica Morgan, an SMS English major, said that this and other examples have shown that France is far from being weak.\n\"They stood up against Hitler when he was in his prime for months before he occupied their country,\" Morgan said. The fact that by the time we got there, the Germans were a heck of a lot weaker than they were when the French had to face them doesn't seem to register.\"\nMorgan emphasized that France's refusal to support U.S. war efforts is a resounding display of strength.\n\"It's somewhat ironic that we call them weak,\" Morgan said. \"They stood up to the U.S. as well, daring the disapproval of the U.S. ... and all we can do is throw childish insults back at them.\"\nLysiane Lavorel, a native of France and college student studying English there, offered a tongue-in-cheek response to France's supposed weakness while making reference to the 1996 film \"Independence Day\".\n\"As for the French being weak, it's true that in comparison with the strong and good Americans preventing aliens from invading the Earth, we are more than weak,\" Lavorel said. \"It's true that we don't have any real impact on the world, and I find it much more comfortable that way ... I wouldn't want to feel responsible for a war, for example.\"\nDoeg's second assumption is that the French are arrogant, and Lavorel agrees again.\n\"Yes of course, I think we French are very arrogant,\" Lavorel said.\nLavorel went on to explain her definition of French arrogance.\n\"It's quite hard for us to see how people [Americans] seem to be so easily manipulated by government, big firms or media,\" Lavorel said. \"Because for most French, we have learned to become skeptical, doubtful and to make our own opinion on things. This appears to be very arrogant, doesn't it?\"\nHowever, she pointed out that this is especially true of Parisians, from which she says many of American's perceptions about the French are based.\n\"Even in France, they [Parisians] are said to be arrogant,\" Lavorel said. \"They are said to consider France as only composed of Paris, and provincial people are just hillbillies.\"\nAn American student at a California university, who asked to remain anonymous to prevent the damage of his reputation among colleagues, said that he would describe 90 percent of the Parisians he has met as being arrogant.\n\"In an academic setting, this arrogance is particularly frustrating,\" the source said. \"Often the Parisians I know belittle other people when they understand a complicated concept better than another person.\n\"On one occasion, a Parisian made a fool out of a good friend of mine,\" the source said. \"My friend asked him how to model the eigenfunction of a microdisk resonator with finite-differences time-domain. He said 'everyone knows you can derive these fields analytically.\"\nThe source said that he is not perpetuating these stereotypes and that his preconceived notions do not alter how he perceives these interactions.\n\"Often I'll hear someone say something like, 'Oh and be careful when you meet him--he's French,\" the source said. \"But you know, 99 percent of the time, all of the stereotypes prove to be perfectly true and the warning is useful.\"\nSMS media student Lydia Mann, who visited France for two weeks recently and has hosted two French foreign exchange students, said that these perceptions are based upon cultural differences.\n\"Americans, I think, misunderstand their culture which leads to their actions,\" Mann said. \"They make a point to make themselves individualistic, which people find rude.\"\nSMS English major Christin Green agrees and believes that this entire discussion that attempts to blanket such a large group of people is ridiculous.\n\"I want to learn about them with an open mind and a fresh perspective, unpolluted by bias or preconceived ideas,\" Green said. \"It is not my place to judge or make assumptions about an entire people. There are bad people everywhere. There are good people everywhere. Stereotypes ruin this foundation and build another one that is much more destructive.\""}

This announcement was followed two days later by NASDAQ\u00ae, which independently announced a definitive agreement to purchase Instinet Group.\nArchipelago and Instinet are innovative e-trading (electronic trading) companies, and formerly were the two largest American rivals to NYSE and NASDAQ, in recent years taking increasingly large portions of their market share. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and other regulatory agencies still have to review and approve the transactions, particularly with respect to US securities law and antitrust law, in order to ensure that the marketplace remains lawful and competitive. \nOther pending issues for NASDAQ include obtaining the approval of Instinet shareholders, as well as customary closing conditions. NYSE must obtain the approval of its members and Archipelago shareholders.\nThese changes, a reaction to increased e-trading competition and a changed regulatory environment, will result in NASDAQ and NYSE trading each other's shares and attempting to grab market share, which many hope will drive down transaction costs and ultimately benefit consumers. However, at least one commentator, Dan Ackman writing in \"Forbes\", has noted that the trading commission at the NYSE currently averages less than a nickel (US$0.05) per share, and was less enthusiastic about potential efficiency gains from electronic trading at the exchange.\nThe transactions are also intended to make the two leading American stock exchanges more globally competitive with such exchanges as the London Stock Exchange, the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, the Toronto Stock Exchange, and the Australian Stock Exchange located in Sydney.\nNYSE Group.\nThe NYSE-Archipelago merger would result in some of the most sweeping changes in the 212-year history of the NYSE. The NYSE, which has always been a not-for-profit company, would for the first time incorporate and itself be a publicly-traded company, in what is potentially a large stock offering. However, the regulatory functions of the NYSE would continue to be conducted independently by a private not-for-profit organization.\nNYSE is merging with Archipelago in a \"stock for membership\" deal, in which NYSE members are to receive cash and 70% of newly issued stock, and Archipelago's shareholders would receive 30% of the new stock, forming a new holding company known as the NYSE Group. The merger is expected to be completed by either the fourth quarter of 2005 or the first quarter of 2006.\n\"This strategic move is courageous, almost unbelievable, but this is going to make the New York Stock Exchange in my opinion a potentially giant publicly traded company. The main reason is they've got brand, they've got companies, they've got liquidity [and] with Archipelago they have electronic global access,\" said Harold Bradley of American Century Investments to \"Investor's Business Daily\".\nNYSE has traditionally used the \"open cry auction\" system where buyers and sellers gather in a boisterous trading floor to shout \"buy\" and \"sell\" orders. It has been slow to adapt to new technology, still manually punching in 90% of its orders. \nHowever, Last November NYSE introduced a new, faster Java-based trading system for its floor exchange that is currently in the process of phased roll-out. NYSE TradeWorks, a management system for stock orders, was developed in a first-of-kind partnership with external company IBM, using J2EE open systems, custom-built Linux-based workstations and HP-UX servers running IBM's WebSphere middleware, and a DB2 database on the back end running on an IBM zSeries mainframe. NYSE, which does most of its IT development internally, announced that they do not plan to combine their IT department with Archipelago's.\nThe future of the traditional floor trading system remains uncertain. Some commentators believe it provides a necessary antidote to the occasionally chaotic instability of electronic trading, while others believe that future trends toward electronic trading would provide advantages of speed and fluidity of trade, and make the old-fashioned system of floor trading redundant and obsolete. Roger Burkhardt, Chief Technology Officer of NYSE, told \"Computerworld\" last December that the merger will attempt a \"hybrid\" trading model where both human and computer trading are coordinated side-by-side, which in its scope is a difficult and unprecedented task.\nCurrent owners of seats in the exchange have expressed concerns over how the new merger will affect them. The seats, which confer the right to trade on the floor and are typically leased to traders under the current system, will likely be bought back by the NYSE Group from the individual owners. The exact system of how traders will lease access to the trading floor from the new company has yet to be worked out.\nAlso of concern to owners is the reported plans for a \"stock lockup\" (preventing selling of portions of stock in the new NYSE Group by the new stock recipients) for the next 3 to 5 years. However, their inability to immediately profit from sale of their newly issued stock would be compensated by the price they receive for their seat, or perhaps by a separate stock issuance.\nThe NYSE has been subject to complaints in recent years, concerning:\nHowever, most of the participants in the merger expressed confidence in taking advantage of historic opportunities. \u201cThis combination will be good for investors and for America. It will create a strong, dynamic and innovative enterprise capable of meeting the demands of investors and issuers throughout the world in the decades ahead,\u201d said John A. Thain, CEO of the NYSE. \u201cAs we look to the future and to the challenge of competing globally in a high-speed electronically connected world, it is clear that we must do more. This transaction will mean we will be more diversified and transparent, and better able to compete, grow and serve our customers.\"\nNASDAQ.\nNASDAQ, formerly an acronym for National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations, was founded in 1971 as the world's first electronic stock market, and by some measures is now the world's largest exchange. Its purchase of Instinet Group, although it followed the NYSE merger announcement by only two days, was actually pursued independently for as long as six months and is set to continue regardless of the NYSE outcome. The sale is expected to be completed by the end of this year.\nNASDAQ's planned acquisition, Instinet Group, will be split along the lines of its separate divisions for sale in a cash transaction (figures are approximate):\nInstinet stockholders would receive about US$1.88 billion in cash total, including the above amounts as well as US$562 million from INET's available cash. Of this amount, about US$1 billion would go to Reuters, a shareholder of 62% of the company's stock, which is getting rid of Instinet to focus on its core areas of providing news and financial data.\nNASDAQ president and CEO Bob Greifeld, said, \u201cThis transaction will allow NASDAQ to compete more effectively with other U.S. and international market centers by making our technological platform more competitive, which will result in greater cost efficiencies and improved quality of execution in our market \u2014 qualities that today\u2019s individual and institutional investors demand. NASDAQ will continue to innovate and will also have the ability to tap new opportunities in other asset classes.\u201d\nHe continued, \u201cRegulation NMS has defined the new competitive landscape by calling for all market centers to be mutually accessible. With this move we maintain our status as the low cost provider and at the same time provide increased order interaction for both NASDAQ and exchange listed securities. We also believe this further enhances our ability to attract new listings. We want to thank all of our partners for their combined efforts on this transaction.\"\nExternal links.\n "}

However backers say nuclear power will help meet the 60% cut by 2050 target.\nSir David King, Chief Scientific Advisor to the government, is a supporter of nuclear power believing that it is the best way to tackle global warming.\nThe chairman of British Nuclear Fuels, a company that operates several British nuclear reactors, said that he expects Tony Blair to make an announcement of new power stations within weeks of the May 5 general election if he is re-elected.\nAnother primary supporter of nuclear power is the ex-BBC Director General Lord Birt, who has been advising 10 Downing Street on various issues by providing 'blue-sky' thinking without payment, as part of the Strategy Unit. He is said to be preparing a report that will say nuclear energy provides an opportunity to reduce dependence on Middle Eastern oil supplies (although very little oil is burnt for electricity production in the UK).\nWhile it is believed that senior Cabinet members would not oppose a plan for new nuclear power stations if Tony Blair proposed it, the Environment Secretary Margaret Beckett and Trade and Industry Secretary Patricia Hewitt both oppose nuclear power.\nNew reactors would probably be sited next to existing reactors to limit public opposition.\nNuclear power currently provides 22% of the UK's electricity needs. The UK has 31 operating reactors at 14 power plants, but by 2015 all but three stations will have been shut down. The last nuclear reactor to open was Sizewell B on the North Sea coast in 1995. The 1,188MW station was a large reason why the UK met its carbon dioxide emissions reduction target in the 1990s. British nuclear power stations have created 2,000 cubic metres of nuclear waste. There are currently no plans for the long-term storage of the waste.\nBy comparison, just over 3% of Britain's electricity comes from renewable energy.

Lawmakers from both parties, particularly Democrats, express strong reservations.\nDemocrats argue against Bolton.\n\"He wants to be our top diplomat at the UN but his life has been something less than diplomatic,\" , the number two Democrat in the Senate, said on a Sunday talk show.\n\"He wants to work with people around the world. And he couldn't work with people in his own office. And he's supposed to be open, as our man at the UN, to ideas from other people,\" Durbin said.\n\"He's been a real tyrant when it came to people he worked with, who disagreed with him. This man doesn't have the temperament for this job.\"\nThere was no consensus Thursday whether the Senate committee should ask Bolton to return for more questioning. He testified for eight hours and presented a written draft on other questions, but the stream of allegations has only intensified, as well as a characterization of him as a boss who mistreated fellow workers and lost his temper frequently.\nDemocratic Senator Christopher Dodd, a member of the Foreign Relations Committee, said Bolton would be hobbled in the job because of the allegations raised during the confirmation hearings. Dodd spoke on CBS's \"Face the Nation.\"\nDodd maintains the Democrats raise objections to Bolton because of evidence he twisted intelligence analysis to fit his personal views. He said Bush should consider withdrawing the nomination.\n\"There are plenty of other good people who embrace his ideological views,\" Dodd added. \nRepublicans divided.\nBut some Republicans had a differing view. Mitch McConnell (R-KY) thought Bolton's \"forceful\" personality made him the ideal candidate to lead U.S. efforts to reform the UN. He put little concern into Bolton's alleged personnel problems, saying that Bolton's supposed history of trying to get analysts who disagreed with him fired were unproven. McConnell is the second ranked Senate Republican. He was also speaking on the CBS program.\nLincoln Chafee, Republican Senator of Rhode Island, has said he is \"less likely\" to vote for the nominee as a result of the questions that are being raised about his credibility. Instead he sought out the opinion of former Secretary of State Colin Powell.\nPowell's spokeswoman, Peggy Cifrino, said he returned calls Thursday to senators who wanted to discuss questions that have been raised about Bolton. Powell was the only former GOP secretary of state who did not sign a recent letter endorsing Bolton for the job. It is known that the two did not get along during Powell's tenure in the Bush Administration. Powell's former chief of staff has been quoted by the US press as saying Bolton would make an \"abysmal ambassador.\"\nSome Republicans in Congress are doubtful that Bolton will win nomination now that the vote has been pushed back to May 12 to allow more time to investigate his history. Speaking on CNN television Senator Arlen Spector, R-PA, said the odds on Bolton were \"too close to call.\"\nBolton criticism of UN.\nSome wondered what Bush's reasoning could be for nominating Bolton for the UN post since Bolton acknowledged saying in 1994 that the UN headquarters in New York \"has 38 stories. If it lost ten stories, it wouldn't make a bit of difference.\"\nAlso in 1994, Bolton said, \"There is no such thing as the United Nations. There is an international community that occasionally can be led by the only real power left in the world, and that's the United States, when it suits our interest and when we can get others to go along.\" \"\nIn response to criticism of these statements at his hearing, Bolton replied, \"There's not a bureaucracy in the world that couldn't be made leaner.\"\nPresidential support.\nIt appears to trained observers that Bush may have to yield his nomination to a Senate rejection. Behind the scenes, Bolton may be facing a question of withdraw or be pushed out. As President Bush asked Senators to support his nominee, Majority Leader Bill Frist, R-Tenn., said he strongly supports Bolton, but \"I can't speak for all of (GOP) leadership.\"\nPresident Bush continues to support his nominee, according to Whitehouse spokespersons. In an April 20 news briefing, press secretary Scott McClellan said in response to a question whether the Bolton nomination was lost, \"No, absolutely not. I think what you're seeing is some Democrats on the committee trumping up allegations and making unsubstantiated accusations against someone the President believes will do an outstanding job at the United Nations. He is someone who has been an effective manager, a strong diplomat who has gotten things done. And I think he's earned the respect of many people that he has worked with because of what he's done...people are playing politics with his nomination...He's exactly the kind of person we need at the United Nations during this time of reform.\"\nOn Sunday, White House spokeswoman Christie Parell, said the president is standing by Bolton as his nominee. \"The president believes he's exactly the man needed at the United Nations,\" she said in reply to Dodd's comments."}

The three-day meeting, started Friday in commemoration of the golden jubilee (50th anniversary) of the original Bandung Conference, resulted in the discussion of a number of important international issues and future plans for similar high-level meetings and programs for action.\nThe two co-hosts of the event were President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono of Indonesia and President Thabo Mbeki of South Africa. Some of the many world leaders in attendance were:\nOriginal Bandung conference, 1955.\nThe 1955 Bandung conference has assumed almost mythical importance, as the giants of that age addressed post-colonial concerns of 29 Asian, African, and Middle Eastern nations, and collectively brought their interests to the world stage.\nThe conference, which was attended by the first Premier of the PRC, Zhou Enlai, and the first Prime Minister of India, Jawaharlal Nehru, was called the \"first intercontinental meeting of colored peoples in the history of mankind\" by its host Sukarno, who was also first prime minister of Indonesia \u2014 men with dreams and ambition in times of great change. \nTheir shared vision gave fresh impetus to the African fight for independence from colonial oppression, and articulated the meaning of the \"spirit of Bandung\" with ten binding principles of non-aggression and peaceful friendship. This approach bore fruit a few years later in the creation the Non-Aligned Movement, which was an attempt by so-called third world countries to coordinate their efforts to remain independent from the power struggle between the United States and Russia during the Cold War.\nThis year's Bandung summit.\nLeaders of some of the world's richest as well as poorest nations attended the summit, together representing some two-thirds of the world's population. Poverty and underdevelopment were the main issues under discussion. Also discussed were terrorism, UN reform, the breakdown of multilateralism, and the benefits and risks of globalization. In response to the recent tragedy of the December 26, 2004 tsunami, the leaders adopted a joint statement to create a shared early warning system.\nOn the last day of the summit, Sunday April 24, Yudhoyono said, \"History will judge us [not based on what we say here, but] on the basis of what we do in the days, months and years ahead -- whether we are true to the Bandung Spirit, or we fail it through failure of political nerve.\n\"We will be judged on how dedicated we are to our Strategic Partnership, on whether we can make it work to ensure a better life for our children's children.\n\"Let us therefore work together, so that we will deserve the kindness of history.\" After the speeches, Yudhoyono and Mbeki signed the \"Declaration on the New Asian-African Strategic Partnership\".\nThe conference was full of symbolism and music, speeches and celebration in honor of the Bandung Spirit and an attempt to recapture some of the magic of those former days. The more than 100 participants are in number the largest-ever gathering of Asian and African leaders. \nAt the conclusion of the conference, led by their two-cohosts, Mbeki and Yudhoyono, more than 40 of the leaders followed in the historical footsteps of the 1955 conference, taking part in the ritual of the \"Bandung walks\". They strolled amid tight security from the aging Savoy Homman Hotel, to the white-columned Gedung Merdeka, or \"Freedom Building\".\nThen the leaders each planted trees in the \"Asia-Africa forest\", one tree per country to symbolize close cooperation between their peoples, before getting on their jets and returning home.\nTensions at the conference.\nThe events at the conference were overshadowed by recent tensions between Japan/China and North Korea/South Korea; however, some good did come of the countries' meeting.\nJapan, China meeting.\nChinese President Hu Jintao and Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi are said to have met on Saturday and talked for about an hour, after Koizumi took the unusual step of a public apology at the conference. The relationship between their countries has been particularly tense in recent weeks; several Wikinews articles, cited below, describe the ongoing Chinese protests and demonstrations against Japan.\nThe two countries are growing commercial rivals and have ongoing territorial disagreements that pertain to certain oil and natural gas deposits they both claim. In addition, some Chinese have been offended by what they see as a Japanese attempt to whitewash their World War II record of aggression in revised school textbooks.\nHu has also taken particular offense at Koizumi's annual habit, since 2001, of visiting the Yasukuni war cemetery and shrine in Tokyo. Hu said that \"[Japan should] never do anything again that would hurt the feelings of the Chinese people.\" Koizumi has not yet visited the shrine so far this year.\nIt remains to be seen if and how the two parties may resolve their deep underlying differences.\nNorth Korea, South Korea meeting.\nNorth Korean President of Parliament Kim Yong Nam and South Korean Prime Minister Lee Hai-chan were among those attending the summit. The two are reported to have met and talked together for about 30 minutes on Saturday concerning the relationship between their countries. Their discussion is said to have touched on such issues of concern as North Korea's nuclear plans.\n\"It was the highest-level meeting between the South and the North since the summit on June 15, 2002. We had a great deal of frank discussions on important issues ... going beyond scheduled time. It was a good meeting. We had frank discussions about dialogue between the authorities [of the South and North] and the six party talks,\" Lee said.\nAccording to Kim, North Korea would come back to the talks \"when conditions were right\". However, a definite timetable for resuming the six-party talks was not given. North Korea has recently boycotted the talks, and complained about certain positions taken by the USA, one of the six parties to the talks.\nProgram for future action.\nDelegates agreed to hold future meetings every two years (for foreign ministers) and every four years (for heads of state) in order to bring the principles of their strategic partnership into productive action. The next meeting of heads of state is planned for 2009 in South Africa.\nSampling of Remarks.\nHere are some representative comments made by various Afro-Asian leaders during their speeches at the summit.\nSecretary General Kofi Annan of the United Nations.\n\"If we are to make our world fairer, freer and safer for all its inhabitants, the institutions of the United Nations should reflect the world of 2005, not 1945 \u2014 particularly the Security Council. I believe the time is approaching when the Member States should take a decision to make the Council more representative, including by strengthening the representation of developing countries. I also believe they should create two new inter-governmental bodies \u2014 a Peacebuilding Commission which would bring together the various actors involved in helping countries move from war to lasting peace, and a Human Rights Council in which States from all regions would participate.\"\nPrime Minister Manmohan Singh of India.\n\"Mr. Chairman Sir, to meet these challenges and constraints, we must respond in a manner worthy of the Bandung spirit. Just as that historic meeting redefined the agenda for its times, we must do so once again here today. The declaration on a new Asian African Strategic Partnership outlines guiding principles for joint action to achieve our goals in a changed global environment...\n\"In this spirit, in cooperation with our neighbour, Pakistan, we have embarked upon a journey of peace and good neighbourly ties. I appreciate the positive sentiments expressed by President Pervez Musharaff yesterday which I fully reciprocate. We are sincere in our desire to resolve all issues in a mutually acceptable manner. This will surely bring benefit to our people and to our region.\"\nPresident Thabo Mbeki of South Africa.\n\"I am honoured to wish this historic second Asian-African Conference success, convinced that we have the will to advance the cause pioneered by some of the greatest sons and daughters of Africa and Asia. We are most grateful to President Yudhoyono, the government and people of Indonesia who have opened the hearts and home to all of us, despite the heavy burdens imposed on them by the recent natural disasters that have claimed hundreds of thousands of lives and caused incalculable destruction.\"\nPresident Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono of Indonesia.\n\"The Strategic Partnership highlights the need to address issues of common concern, such as armed conflict, weapons of mass destruction, transnational organized crime and terrorism. Our strategic partnership also emphasized the need to promote practical cooperation in areas such as trade, industry, investment, finance, tourism, information and communication technology, energy, health, transportation, agriculture, water resources and fisheries. We are determined to prevent conflict and resolve disputes by peaceful means.\""}

As part of a ceremony, the treaty was signed by the heads of state of each of the 25 current EU members, as well as the Bulgarian and Romanian heads of state, in what is seen as the most important step towards EU accession.\nThe signature of the accession treaty marks the transition of Bulgaria and Romania from candidate countries of the EU to accession countries, which can now send observers to the European Parliament and participate in several European Union institution meetings. The countries will also receive extra funding between today and January 1, 2007, when the two countries are set to become full members of the European Union.\nThe accession treaty signing has been met with celebration in both Bulgaria and Romania. Romania also organised in Luxembourg a series of cultural events, known as \"Zilele Rom\u00e2niei la Luxembourg\" (Romania's Days in Luxembourg). The cultural events included traditional Romanian music, concerts, an artistic performance and exhibitions by several important Romanian visual artists. Before the ceremony, Romanian Prime Minister C\u0103lin Popescu-T\u0103riceanu said:\nThe 860-page treaty finalises the candidacy of the two Southeastern European states, who will now have to work hard to implement last-minute reforms until their accession date, less than 21 months away. Both states must crack down on corruption, as well as secure their external borders, strengthen the judiciary and align competition law with EU standards. Romania has recently been praised for taking decisive action against corruption, even though EU lawmakers said that there is a lot left to be done. Upon accession in 2007, Romania will also have the second-largest external border in the European Union, after Finland. Due to this, it has recently upgraded several of its border checkpoints with Ukraine and Republic of Moldova, even though more is left to be done until 2007.\nThe accession treaty signed today also includes references to a safeguard clause, which makes way for a delay in accession until 2008 if either Bulgaria or Romania do not meet their commitments.\nApart from the political reforms needed to join the European Union, EU funds will also help economic development in the two countries, enabling them to improve infrastructure, especially roads, clean up the environment and modernise their industries. While both countries are among the most developed in their region of Southeastern Europe, their per-capita income is between 30-35% of the European Union average. Therefore, when they join, they will be the two poorest countries in the EU.\nThe signing of the accession treaty should also boost foreign investment to the two countries. Both countries have benefited in terms of foreign investment from being candidate countries of the EU, and their new accession country status is expected to lure more foreign investors. Romania also introduced a flat tax rate of 16% on personal income and corporate profit this year to attract more foreign investment.\nWhen Bulgaria and Romania join in 2007, the European Union will have a population of approximately 484 million people, 30 million more than now. It will also raise the number of its members to 27, and add two extra official languages: Bulgarian and Romanian. The Bulgarian language will be the first official language of the European Union to be written in Cyrillic script."}

Over the course of the hour, the list showed changes to topics like \"Time Travel,\" \"Dante Alighieri\" and, in German, \"The Maronite Patriarchs of Antioch.\"\nWales started with a summary of Wikipedia's goals; the bulk of the time was given over to questions from audience members. Approximately 65 people listened to Wales' remarks. According to a hands-up poll that Wales conducted at the start of the event, about half of those present had edited Wikipedia before. Six of those counted themselves as \"Wikipedians,\" a title Wales suggested than anyone who's edited the Wikipedia even once should consider.\nBefore the event, Samuel Klein demonstrated the program, RCBirds, that created the running list behind Wales. RCBirds plays a bird call in response to each edit made to Wikipedia. Wikipedians edit constantly; one attendee found the frequency of bird calls distracting and asked Klein to turn down the volume on the program. \nWales ran through some quick statistics about Wikipedia:\nThough the Chinese Wikipedia has over 25,000 articles, according to Wales, the Hindi and Arabic versions are smaller than Wales would like. Referring to those two editions, Wales said that Wikipedia is, \"not so strong where we really need to be.\" Wales added later that the Chinese government has blocked access to the Wikipedia twice; once during the approach to an anniversary of Tiannamen Square, and once for no discernable reason. \"We could make a big deal out of being blocked,\" said Wales, \"but we'd just score points with the western media, and it wouldn't get us any closer to our goal.\" \nWales described the organization behind the Wikipedia as an \"International Red Cross of information,\" able -- and impelled -- to work in a neutral fashion with governments and NGOs. When asked about reaching out to the UN, however, he said that he had been warned by a Dutch minister that large bureaucracies tend to be comfortable working with other large bureacracies; the Wikipedia employs only Wales and thousands of volunteers.\nWales cited three factors that correlate with Wikipedia growth:\nOn the topic of the Hindi Wikipedia, Wales attributed the lack of growth to the prevalence of English keyboards. He said that when he has asked Hindi Wikipedia contributors what made the task difficult for them, they said that they were, \"not used to typing Hindi.\"\n\"I don't know how to help with that,\" Wales said. He hoped that the situation would improve.\nAt this point in the talk, Wales opened the floor to questions."}

His 50 minute address from the Kremlin's Marble Hall only briefly touched on the \"epidemic of collapse\" , a reference to upheavals in Chechnya, Kyrgyzstan and the Ukraine, which was \"a real drama\" stranding millions of Russians beyond the borders of the Russian Federation.\nBrushing off what was probably taken as criticism during last week's visit by Condoleezza Rice who commented the Kremlin ran a \"managed democracy\", Putin stressed that \"Russia ... will decide for itself the pace, terms and conditions of moving towards democracy.\" \nPutin was critical of the lack of progress in implementing his reform proposals. Calling for a crackdown on corruption, where treatment by tax inspectors are \"terrorizing business\", he addressed concerns of the business community by condemning a series of back-tax bills like the ones that dismembered Yukos and face other major Russian corporations.\nHe was also critical of a bureaucratic attitudes that treat \"state service as some type of business\". He made clear the need for investment must be met by \"rules of the game\" that are consistent, saying \"Russia is certainly interested in the inflow of private investments on a large scale, including foreign investments. It is our strategic choice and our strategic approach.\"\nPutin called for proposals to index wages to inflation over the next two years, and for the introduction of a flat 13% tax on undeclared earnings in the shadow economy, a slice that represents nearly 35% of the nation's economy, by legalizing what was previously defined as illegal income.\nPutin supports the development of a strong state system with determination for Russia to avoid the disarray that led to the collapse of the Soviet Union. Saying, \"First and foremost it is worth acknowledging that the demise of the Soviet Union was the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the century.\" He sees the need for strengthening the legal system and the political environment to assure a more just society in avoiding a replay of a Russian downfall.\nOn politics, he pointedly abandoned the much-used \u2018stability' catch phrase of the bureaucracy. Putin signaled to the bureaucratic caste who are on the eve of their upcoming parliamentary and presidential elections they should promote partisanship and civil society.\nBy studiously avoiding too many references to business, the thrust of his address sought to reassure the small property holder class, rather than big business and other elite investors."}

The workers have been running the factory themselves since the Argentinian government meltdown in 2001, and say they are more effective working independently.\nThere are now 410 workers at FaSinPat ('Fabrica sin Patrones' or 'Factory without Bosses'), having hired over 170 new workers in four years of autonomous control. The factory is widely known as Zanon, the name under the previous owner, Luis Zanon, who accumulated some US$170 million in debt, and shut down the factory, firing the workers.\nArgentinian government and businesses were in chaos at the time, with the government dissolving repeatedly and defaulting on $88 billion of debt, inflation skyrocketing and people demanding money from banks who had closed their doors.\nLike over 200 Argentinian workplaces facing similar conditions, the workers chose spontaneously to run the factory themselves, and continued maintenance and production, to keep trading on their own behalf.\nNow thirty workers have travelled the 1,200 kilometers to Buenos Aires, presenting a petition containing thousands of signatures from all over the world at the central courthouse, and mobilising outside.\n\"With these actions we are marking a playing ground for the judge,\" said Raul Godoy, Zanon worker and General Secretary of the Ceramists' Union.\nReports of violence against a Zanon worker.\nAs the government has continued its legal assault upon the Zanon factory, at least one factory employee has been reported to have suffered repeated threats and violence at the hand of unknown attackers.\nEsteban Magnani, author of \"El Cambio Silencioso\" (\"The Silent Change\"), a book about worker cooperatives in Argentina told \"UpsideDownWorld.org\", \"In Neuquen you have Jorge Sobisch, a right wing governor who wants to be the new [President] Carlos Menem ... wants to show how tough he is ... Zanon is very politicized and famous, which is bad for a governor who wants to be seen as a right wing savior. Sobisch feels the need to crack down now, because the longer he waits, the more powerful Zanon becomes.\" Some of the workers feel that Sobisch may be approving the attacks or may be culpable in failing to defend the workers.\nMagnani indicates incumbent President N\u00e9stor Kirchner, described by Wikipedia as \"a Peronist with leftist leanings\", might defend Zanon. \"One of Kirchner\u2019s flags is human rights. Now with this kidnapping and the continued threats, Kirchner shouldn\u2019t have any excuse to not do something about this.\"\n\"Subway workers, train workers, airline workers, other recuperated businesses and many other sectors have made it clear that the employees at Zanon will not be alone.\" Says one Zanon worker, \"We are willing to defend the factory with our lives.\"\nIt may not come to that. Governnor Sobisch has been attempting to evict the workers of Zanon in an ongoing, highly politicized legal battle for several years. Sobisch has been ordered by the Federal Supreme Court of Argentina to evict the workers as soon as possible. \nOther sources consulted about the past record of behavior by Sobisch do not reflect a record of overt violence against the workers. At least one source from October 2004 said that Sobish wants the workers to leave the Zanon factory and work instead in a government-sponsored micro-enterprise project for unemployed workers, constructing prefabricated houses."}

She says: \u201cI am improving and everybody\u2019s prayers are helping enormously. Thank you for all the flowers which are beautiful. If you still want to give flowers please donate instead\nto the World Poverty Day through the Catholic Agency for Overseas Development or any other way. Thank you.\"\nDetective Superintendent Adrian Harper then talked about the details of the attack they had learned from Abigail.\n\"My officers spent several hours with Abigail yesterday taking the statement, together with members of her family. The amount of information that Abigail has managed to give us is extraordinary given her current condition. As I will shortly explain, she has been through an even more harrowing experience than we imagined and the strain of going through it with her at her hospital bed was a very emotional experience for both her family members and both of my detectives.\n\"The bravery and strength of Abigail is extraordinary - she is determined to help catch this man as soon as possible and insisted on being interviewed for around six hours yesterday and wants to continue again today. This is a most unusual interview process - with a very intelligent and strong young woman - communicating through blinking, mouthing and facial expressions\n\"What Abigail has told us is very significant to this inquiry. We are now able to work on confirmed information directly from her rather than having to rely on what she said to other witnesses and the evidence of local residents. What she has said has changed the focus of the inquiry and enabled us to rule out the man with the blue Peugeot that we had previously arrested and bailed. We now believe that he was probably in the area at the time but that he was not involved in the assault on Abigail.\n\"Abigail has now been able to tell us that she first saw the man who attacked her at about 3.45pm on the afternoon of Wednesday 20 April, on the public footpath along Water Lane in Little Bookham. The man was in a blue estate car, four-door plus the rear hatch, right hand drive, older style, plain, all one colour.\n\"The man was in the blue vehicle ahead of Abigail. The vehicle drove towards and past her and they looked at each other. At that point Abigail started to feel very uneasy and put Joseph into the buggy and started to walk home along the track. When she was about three quarters of the way along the track she turned and saw that the car had pulled up some way behind at that the male was out of the car and coming towards her. She started to panic and immediately began running along the footpath with Joseph still in his buggy.\n\"Abigail reached the gate that leads onto the lane off Burnhams Road but could not open it. She the heard the man say, you have dropped your purse. She turned around and saw that the man had grabbed hold of Joseph and was holding a knife to his throat.\n\"The man indicated to Abigail to come towards him, which she did. He then grabbed her hair, pulled her down towards the ground and as he did so stabbed her once in the back of the neck with the knife. He then [pushed] the buggy, with Joseph still in it, on top of her and ran off.\n\"Abigail has said that the offender was alone and was someone she does not know. She describes him as being aged between 20 and 35 years-old, with short dark wavy or scruffy hair, between 5ft 10in, her height, and 6ft 4in tall, her husband\u2019s height, with a long thin face and prominent cheekbones. He was wearing looped silver earrings, roughly three-quarters of an inch in diameter in both ears. She also describes quite a deep voice, a pale face and black bags under his eyes. She has also said that she believes that he was under the influence of drink or drugs. She does not know why he attacked her and he does not appear to have attempted to rob her. Her purse and mobile phone were not taken.\n\"This man is clearly an extremely dangerous offender. Anyone who is prepared to threaten a young child and try to kill his mother in front of him is clearly capable of anything. It is our duty to inform the public about the danger that this man poses and appeal to everyone for information that can help us to catch him as soon as possible.\n\"The appeal I want to make is quite precise. We could easily be overwhelmed by information that would hamper the inquiry rather than help it. What we need is very specific. Do you know a man who fits this description, who has access to a blue estate car and who could have been in the Bookham area on the afternoon of Wednesday 20 April. If you know anyone who fits this profile, if you live with him or he is your child you must come forward to us. I repeat, anyone who is prepared to act in the way that this offender has done is clearly capable of anything and is a danger to anyone who comes into contact with him, no matter who they are.\n\"Please do not approach him but contact Surrey Police on 0845 125 2222 with information or call 999 immediately if you know where he is.\"\nAssistant Chief Constable Mark Rowley ended the press conference by saying \"It is hard to imagine a more compelling picture of vulnerability and innocence than a mother and toddler chased attacked and left for dead so brutally.\n\"There is no clear motive to this attack such as robbery or sexual assault, although the offender may well have been under the influence of drink or drugs. He is clearly a very dangerous man who must be caught as soon as possible. We are conducting an enormous operation, already committing over 150 officers and have gathered a wealth of material for forensic examination but need the public's help to identify the offender as soon as possible.\n\"I would reiterate the appeal that Detective Superintendent Adrian Harper has just made, to appeal to the conscience of every citizen to help us catch this brutal and dangerous man. This is a crime so horrific that I would hope that, for anyone watching this appeal, helping us identify the offender would come before any loyalty to family, friends or even criminal associates - this man must be caught.\""}

The news director of \"Prima TV\" Dan Dumitru, said he received a call from Iraq on late Tuesday, in which he spoke both to the kidnappers and the journalists. The kidnappers gave the government a further 24 hours to withdraw their troops, while the kidnapped journalists told Dumitru to put pressure on the Romanian government for the withdrawal of the troops. The three made a \"final appeal\" to the Romanian president, Traian B\u0103sescu, to withdraw the troops, saying that the time of their killing was set on Wednesday, at 14:00 UTC.\nThe Islamic terrorists which kidnapped three Romanian journalists last month extended the deadline for their execution from Tuesday to today. In a tape aired on Al-Jazeera last Friday, the terrorists, who call themselves the Muadh ibn Jabal Brigades, gave the Romanian government until Tuesday, at 14:00 UTC, to withdraw their 860 troops from Iraq, or otherwise the journalists would be killed. On Monday, the Romanian Prime Minister, C\u0103lin Popescu-T\u0103riceanu, said that his country would not yield to terrorist demands, and it appears that this has caused the extension of the ultimatum by a day.\nYesterday, Bucharest and other Romanian cities were filled by ralliers asking for the release of the troops, holding up banners saying \"Freedom\" in English, Romanian and Arabic. Also, the mother of Sorin Miscoci, one of the hostages said, \"This is the hardest day, we are thinking that their hours are numbered. We trust the authorities until the end.\" Vasile Ion, the father of Marie-Jeanne Ion, another hostage, said, \"We call for the urgent withdrawal of the Romanian contingent from Iraq, before it is too late for our children. The kidnappers have made a political threat and they are waiting for a political response.\"\nCommentators from Prima TV observed that, on the tape shown by the terrorists, one of the journalists, Sorin Miscoci, was wearing orange overalls. The commentators described this as \"culoarea mor\u0163ii\" (\"the colour of death\"), since Iraqi terrorists had previously dressed hostages in orange, as an attempt to show that their threats were serious.\nThe Romanian government has not made any official comment after the extension of the deadline. In its last official statement, it said that it would not withdraw the troops. A Romanian pullout would be seen as a significant blow to the US-led Coalition of the Willing, since Romania currently has one of the largest contingents in Iraq."}

Its manufacturer's serial number is 001, and it is registered F-WWOW.\nThe new Airbus will initially be sold in two versions: the A380-800, a full double-decker configuration, able to carry 555 passengers in a three-class configuration or up to 800 passengers in a single-class economy configuration.

And a backlog of documents recovered from the former regime remain to be examined.\nHe described the ISG investigation as hampered by: \nA preference for reinforcement of short-term security on the part of the coalition forces over anti-proliferation efforts, fear of arrest and detention on the part of the Iraqi personnel, and other factors in the continuing conflict of the post-war environment, all impacted on the effort by the ISG.\nThe report confirms the expressed opinion of former UN weapons inspector, Scott Ritter, that Iraq had no significant WMDs. \"[T]here was not a single intelligence service in the world that said Iraq maintained massive stockpiles of weapons of mass destruction,\" Ritter said at the time.\nDuelfer summary of the intelligence obtained, as understood by the ISG, includes, \"[T]he risk of Iraqi WMD expertise of material advancing the WMD potential in other countries is attenuated by many factors and is presently small ...\"\nAnd, \"So far, insurgent efforts to attain unconventional weapons have been limited and contained by coalition actions.\"\nAlso, \"There continue to be reports of WMD in Iraq. ISG has found that such reports are usually scams or in misidentification of materials or activities. In a very limited number of cases they have related to old chemical munitions produced before 1990.\"\nThe new addenda included information on the Iraqi Military Industrial Commission, the \"state-run military-industrial complex\" which played a \"central role in the evolution of all the Regime's weapons programs\"."}

The news was first broken by entertainment magazine Soap Opera Weekly. \nTylo played the role of Dr. Taylor Hamilton Forrester from 1990 until 2002, when she was killed off by villainess Sheila Carter, played by Kimberlin Brown. Taylor's love affair with Ridge Forrester (played by Ronn Moss), and the ensuing triangle with Brooke Logan (played by Katherine Kelly Lang), helped the then-fledgling soap move higher in the ratings in the early to mid-1990s. According to Soap Opera Weekly, history has been rewritten so that Taylor, in reality, did not die from her gunshot wounds back in October 2002. Her return is tied in with a 1994 storyline in which Taylor was held captive by Moroccan prince Omar (played by Indian actor Kabir Bedi). Both Tylo and Bedi are first seen on Monday, May 2.\nThe magazine states that she has been on the set of the soap opera at CBS Television City since March 11. For a while, she didn't even tell her husband, former \"Guiding Light\" actor Michael Tylo, where she was really going. She told him that she was just going on \"a lot of auditions,\" and that if she told sooner than she did, the news might slip out accidentally. Her husband currently teaches a class at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas and she couldn't afford any accidental hints that his students could have picked up on.\nThis is not the first time Tylo has rejoined the series. She left in highly publicized disputes most recently in 2000 and 2001, due to a lack of story for her character. Her most publicized departure, however, was in 1996; Tylo was scheduled to join the cast of \"Melrose Place\" and was fired when \"Melrose\"'s producer Aaron Spelling found out she was pregnant. She took him to court and won after nearly a year of messy legal battles. All three times she was allowed to return to the show more or less without comment.\nWith more than 300 million viewers in nearly 100 countries, \"The Bold and the Beautiful\" is claimed to be the most-watched television series in the world.\nSee image&lt;br&gt;\nHunter Tylo book cover photo"}

Now, in the run-up to a May 5 general election and with no evidence of a serious threat from pre-invasion Iraq having come to light, a furor has erupted over the issue.\nHigh-ranking governmental legal advisor, Elizabeth Wilmshurst, protested in her resignation letter just prior to the invasion, about sudden, unexplained changes the Attorney General had made in the tone of his legal advice to the government. In the space of a few weeks, Lord Goldsmith dropped suggestions that the government may have been legally culpable if it invaded without receiving specific support in the form of a new UN Resolution.\nWhen the \"BBC News website\" finally obtained Wilmshurt's resignation letter under Freedom of Information, her protest over the Attorney General's unexplained turnaround was obscured.\nThe missing paragraph was later obtained by \"Channel 4 News\":\n\"My views accord with the advice that has been given consistently in this office before and after the adoption of UN security council resolution 1441 and with what the attorney general gave us to understand was his view prior to his letter of 7 March. (The view expressed in that letter has of course changed again into what is now the official line.)\"\nConservative party leader Michael Howard, wants to know what made Lord Goldsmith change his advice to the government. He told Channel Four, \"The Prime Minister [Tony Blair] has said that the attorney general's advice given to the cabinet on the 17 of March was clear and the attorney general did not change that advice. Well, we now know the attorney general did change that advice and the question is what or who changed it.\"\nForeign Secretary Jack Straw, in a statement last month, read in both houses of parliament, defended initially censoring the letter on privacy grounds, and the later omission of the two revealing lines \"because their content concerned the provision of legal advice in relation to the use of force against Iraq.\"\nAlthough Ms Wilmshurst describes the Attorney General Lord Goldsmith's 13-page, March 7 letter as being a change to his previously expressed view against a war without specific UN support, even this letter expressed serious misgivings, according to both Channel 4 and the \"Guardian\".\nFurther refinements brought his advice to a short 300 word 'summary' delivered to cabinet on March 17, giving a full go-ahead for invasion. The letter was not published, according to Philippe Sands in the \"Guardian\", a breach of ministerial protocol. Both letters have since been obtained by both the \"Guardian\" and Channel 4.\nAccording to Mr Straw in Parliament last month, \"The Attorney-General made clear in his [March 17 advice] his genuinely and independently-held view that military action in Iraq was lawful on the basis of Saddam's breach of the existing UN resolutions,\".\nBut in the earlier and longer version, the Attorney General Lord Goldsmith had written, \"I remain of the opinion that the safest legal course would be to secure the adoption of a further resolution to authorise the use of force.\"\nIn the absence of such a resolution, he added, if war was pursued, \"we would need to be able to demonstrate hard evidence of non-compliance and non-cooperation.\"\nWhen the later, short version was put before cabinet, no-one asked what this hard evidence might be, that supposedly showed Iraq was in breach of UN Resolutions 1441, 678 and 687, despite the possibility that without such evidence, the UK might be on shaky legal ground and accused of launching a war of aggression.\n\"So concerned was the government about the possibility of such a [legal] case that it took steps to put together a legal team to prepare for possible international litigation,\" he wrote, in a \"Guardian\" story in February, which examined the two letters of legal advice.\nThe final report by the post-invasion Iraq Survey Group \u2014 \"the best picture that could be drawn concerning the events, programs, policies, and underlying dynamics of the relationship of the former Regime to WMD over the last three decades\", according to the team head, CIA Special Advisor Charles Duelfer \u2014 concludes that Iraq was not capable of any WMD-related threat at the time of the invasion, and that the sanctions were still limiting the ability to develop any capability.\nIran was the country Saddam was most afraid of, Iraq had no written strategy for WMD development, and the closest thing to actual WMDs mentioned seems to be preliminary designs for missile delivery systems that could have exceeded the UN-specified range limit of 150km for Iraqi missiles under the sanction regime."}

The premier has put his government's prestige on the line with assurances to the nation that full light would be shed on the shooting.\nCalipari, one of the top intelligence agents in Italy, had negotiated a settlement with hostage takers in Baghdad and was rescuing journalist Giuliana Sgrena from them when American soldiers fired on the car they were in. Calipari became a national hero for Italians after he bravely threw his own body across hers as the firing continued, killing him and seriously injuring Sgrena with a few bullets in her back. She is still recovering.\nMeanwhile, Americans released a document, now described as incomplete, which says the U.S. Army, in a joint inquiry with Italian officials, cleared its own soldiers of any responsibility in the tragic events of March 4.\nDemands for troops to leave Iraq from former president.\nThe Prime Minister has put his reputation on the line says Francesco Cossiga, an ex president of Italy.

Cossiga is demanding the U.S. release them to Italian officials for trial or make the commitment to put them before an American court martial.\nBerlusconi said that Italy would \"never endorse\" a report on the shooting by US soldiers of an Italian intelligence agent if it was unconvincing.\n\"If there are differences, they will emerge. But certainly, we will never endorse things that do not convince us,\" Mr. Berlusconi told reporters.\nAn international group of journalists, \u201cReporters without borders\u201d (Reporters sans fronti\u00e8res), said they were \u201cvery surprised\u201d at Tuesday\u2019s report released by the U.S. Army.\n\u201cWe are not convinced that everything possible has been done to establish what happened in this tragedy or to determine the responsibility of all those involved, and we reiterate our appeal for an independent international enquiry by US and Italian authorities,\" the press freedom organization said.\nThey had asked for a United Nations investigation immediately after the shooting. They also commented on the fact that the two Italian investigators disagreed with the findings of the U.S. Army and refused to sign the finished reports.\n\"We will see then what official reaction comes from the Italian government, which has a right to demand sanctions,\" it said.\nFormer hostage and attack survivor Giuliana Sgrena very critical of report.\nMs. Sgrena again today described the Army\u2019s announcement as a \"slap in the face for the Italian government.\" U.S. investigators were satisfied, according to the report, that \"the procedures were followed to the letter\" by the soldiers involved. Ms. Sgrena repeated her statement that the car in which she, Calipari and another agent, the driver, were travelling had \u201cno warning signal\u2026no warning shot\u201d and \"the searchlight was turned on after the shots were fired.\"\nThe position of the U.S. high command, that soldiers had followed procedures, has remained unchanged since they first asserted this shortly after the incident occurred.\nU.S. Secretary of Defense, Donald Rumsfeld said of the report and its investigators, \"My latest information is that they [the Americans and Italians] have not come to a final agreement on a joint report...It's an investigation, it was done together, intimately, and I think that we'll just have to wait and see what they come out with.\""}

Charles Kennedy (Liberal Democrats), Michael Howard (Conservative Party, currently Opposition) and Tony Blair (Labour Party, incumbent) were asked questions by an audience representative of the British public. The politicians were given no advance notice of the questions. David Dimbleby hosted the discussion, as he has other \"Question Time\" debates.\nTopics that were raised included taxation and the new 50% top rate of tax proposed by the Lib Dems, immigration and controls proposed by the Conservatives, the largely negative campaigning launched by the Tories, and the legality of the Iraq war. Also, bullying and discipline in schools, further education and public health were issues raised.\nCharles Kennedy's period in the \"hot chair\" was notable for the largely benevolent questions posed to him, and considerable support evident from applause and cheering at the end of several points made. He attacked the British First Past the Post electoral system as \"perverse\" and said that he would support a proportional voting system if he got into power. When questioned as to whether, upon pressure from the US, he would go to war again in the Middle East without sufficient evidence, he replied strongly \"No.\" Further, he said he could not see the Liberal Democrats in another coalition with any other party that may come into power.\nIn contrast, the opposition leader entered accompanied with less enthusiasm, including several cries of \"Howard is evil!\" by several unidentifiable members of the audience. Michael Howard revealed during the debate that, if that he knew all of the things he knew now, he would have supported the invasion of Iraq with Tony Blair. However, he still upholds the illegality of the war and the way it began, and the apparent lies on the part of the Prime Minister to the people as primary reasons to vote for his party.\nTony Blair's interview period was highlighted by the decision to go to war on Iraq, and the Attorney General's advice in a recently leaked dossier. Difficult questions relevant to the amount of consultation he made with his Cabinet members and the Intelligence groups, and the amount of division within his cabinet with regards to the Iraq War were raised. The Prime Minister was visibly under pressure, and was openly surprised at several statements made by the public present. Upon hearing that local surgeries did not allow appointments to be booked until less than 48 hours before an available time in order to meet government targets, he was unprepared and appeared surprised.\nToward the end of the discussion, hecklers in the front row interrupted the rounding up of the program.\nConsidering the content of \"Question Time\", it would seem that the problem of Iraq, and whether the British public can trust the current Prime Minister, may overshadow political debate concerning domestic issues."}

The device uses a lithium tantalate (LiTaO3) pyroelectric crystal to ionize deuterium atoms and accelerate the ions towards a stationary erbium deuteride (ErD) target. Fusion of two deuterium nuclei results in the emission of helium nuclei (alpha particles), neutrons and gamma rays. The team anticipates applications of the device as a tabletop neutron generator, or in \"microthrusters\" for space propulsion. It is possible that there may be applications related to nuclear weapons, although this possibility is not discussed in the research paper.\nThis development is not related to earlier claims of tabletop fusion or \"cold fusion\" having been observed during sonoluminescence. In fact, the leader of the team behind this development was one of the main critics of earlier low-temperature fusion claims.\nThis device is not the first reliable tabletop fusion device; the Farnsworth-Hirsch fusor, developed in the early 1960s in the laboratory of Philo T. Farnsworth who was instrumental in developing television, is sold commercially as a neutron source. Research by Dr. Todd Rider of MIT suggests that the kind of non-equilibrium fusion produced in these sources will never be usable as an energy source (see his PhD thesis). "}

No wonder its use is on the rise.\nDemir is the owner-operator of the Shell gas station that changed over on Thursday from what used to be a Texaco. He expects pump prices to hit $2.50 a gallon before levelling and the sticker shock wears off.\nDemir estimates he passes along in the form of higher gas prices a nickel per gallon due to the surcharge he incurs from processing electronic purchases. Each time a buyer uses plastic to make a payment, he submits the receipt to a bank to process for having the money credited into his account. The bank keeps 3% of the total amount of his transactions as a processing surcharge, or fee.\nWhen the use of plastic was first gaining acceptance in the gas pumping business, people who used plastic paid a higher price, about 3 cents a gallon, when at the time gas cost about a dollar a gallon. Then advertising campaigns offering \u201cCredit same as Cash\u201d started, and changed the business standard to where now all stations charge the same, regardless of cash or plastic payment.\n\u201cThe banks are making a lot of money on this,\u201d Demir says. Now that the price of gas has more than doubled, the fees banks collect on processing these plastic transactions has more than doubled too. The entire transaction banks use to process these payments is electronic, involving hardly any labor at all. But the processing fee remains unchanged, which means a fat paycheck for banks.\nNow maybe he and other gas stations will go back to offering a discount for cash. Processing plastic transactions is a variable cost to Demir over which he has no control when his pump prices are 'Credit same as Cash\". The use of plastic directly affects his profit margin by the 3% processing fee.\nWhen asked about high gas prices from suppliers, he dismissed the notion with a wave of his hand. \u201cThey control everything,\u201d he said.

This will involve the exemption of 11 state-owned mining companies from financial obligations, of contributing to the state budget, worth 115 million euro. The largest tax exemptions were awarded to the Oltenia National Lignite Company, with 47.4 million euro and to the National Coal Company in Petro\u015fani (38.3 million euro). The exemption took effect on April 26.\nState aid to several industries, especially mining and steelworking, is expected to decline in the coming years, as the European Union has told Romania that it needs to stop subsidising loss-making industries in order to be able to fully integrate into the European Union common market. Additionally, Romania's new Justice and Truth (Liberal-Democrat) governing coalition is keen on further liberalising Romania's free-market economy, by greater privatisation, fiscal liberalisation and a reduction in state aid."}

The casino, which was designed and built over a period of five years, cost US$2.7 billion to construct. The hotel stands nearly fifty stories above the Las Vegas valley, with a 180-foot tall mountain in front of the main entrance.\nNumerous lavish touches contributed to the high expense of the development. The sign in front of the Wynn property has an unusual mechanical design, with a large piece containing the \"Wynn\" logo, which can move vertically up or down as different announcements are presented.\n\"I think it's going to start a shift of power. It's been the south for a long time. Things will start moving to the north because of Wynn Las Vegas, Sheldon Adelson with the expansion of the Venetian, the New Frontier -- that whole area will become the new hot area of Las Vegas for the next decade or so,\" gaming expert Anthony Curtis told \"Las Vegas KLAS TV\".\nAs the property opened to the public, developer Steve Wynn greeted visitors at the front entrance.\n\"It's always fascinating to watch people enter the thing and get their first moment after we open the doors,\" Wynn told the \"Las Vegas Review-Journal\".\nConcern about the cost.\nAnalysts are not too concerned about the cost of the Wynn development. Wynn paid off the cost of \"The Mirage\" hotel-casino in 18 months, much earlier than the planned seven years for which the debt had been scheduled for repayment.\n\"If you remember the opening of The Mirage in 1989, Wynn needed to make a nut of $1 million a day. Everyone thought he was nuts; 'couldn't be done,' they all said,\" Las Vegas history department Chairman Hal Rothman told the \"Las Vegas Review-Journal\".\nWynn sold his interest in Mirage Resorts to MGM Grand (which became MGM Mirage and is now run by Kirk Kerkorian) for US$6.4 billion back in 2000, then turned around and purchased the property for the Wynn hotel-casino for US$275 million. The property was previously the home of the Desert Inn.\nThe hotel has 2,359 rooms, and a few hundred deluxe suites and \"parlors\" for high rollers. The casino has 1,960 slot machines and 137 table games on a 111,000 square foot casino floor. A Ferrari-Maserati dealership and the \"Le Reve\" stage show, featuring a million gallon water tank, round out the expensive offerings.\nA round of golf will go for US$500 on the elaborate golf course located behind the main building.\nAll of these specifications add up to a record construction cost of over one million US dollars per room. Other expensive Las Vegas properties cost a fraction of the price, such as the Bellagio, which cost half the price at US$533,000 per room. The most expensive hotel property in the world was previously the Grand Wailea Resort in Maui, Hawaii, which cost US$775,000 per room.\n\"Yes, (Wynn) may be in over his head, but then he has found ways to survive before,\" Las Vegas professor Bill Thompson told the \"Las Vegas Review-Journal\".\nReaction from the competition.\nSeveral of Wynn's largest competitors spoke with admiration of the property and looked forward to its impact on Las Vegas.\n\"I've never understood the hand-wringing about something new, especially in Las Vegas and Atlantic City,\" Harrah's Chairman and CEO Gary Loveman told the \"Las Vegas Review-Journal\".\nOther casino bosses from the Mandalay and the MGM Mirage had positive comments as well, hoping to pick up some new business from the development.\n\"It's a positive in terms of bringing more visitors,\" Mandalay Resort Group President and CEO Glenn Schaeffer told the \"Las Vegas Review-Journal\".\n\"Steve will build a great property and bring new people to town. If we're doing what we're supposed to be doing, then we'll pick up some of that business also,\" MGM Mirage Chairman and CEO Terry Lanni told the \"Las Vegas Review-Journal\".\nReaction from the public.\nThousands of visitors gathered for hours in front of the property before it opened. Security guards had to monitor the number of visitors entering the building.\n\"I think it's spectacular,\" David Schwartz, coordinator of the Gaming Studies Research Center at the University of Nevada Las Vegas told \"Reuters\".\n\"People were pushing and shoving,\" Las Vegan Kathie Anderson told \"Associated Press\".\n\"There is nobody in the world who creates such entertaining and beautiful casinos,\" British billionaire Richard Branson told \"Associated Press\" from the casino floor. \"I would say every other casino must be nervous. He's lifted the bar dramatically,\" Branson said.\n\"This would be hard to top,\" Las Vegan Marlene DeMarco told \"Reuters\"."}

Entire farm crops were destroyed to prevent the GM variety from spreading further, including those at research stations.\n\"Ten years of research aimed at improving disease resistance in papayas was destroyed, along with the experimental crops,\" said Wilai Prasartsri to \"The Nation\" in Thailand when 1,000 suspected genetically modified papaya trees there were buried under 2 meters of soil. Prasartsri is the research station chief of Muang district, Khon Kaen. \nAgriculture and Cooperatives Minister Somsak Thepsuthin said at the time only GM crops were to be destroyed, out of 2,600 papaya crops sampled across Northeast Thailand. Papaya on the Khon Kaen farm were destroyed, and a control zone was set up within a 450metre radius of the GM contamination to prevent possible spread.\nDirector of state-funded non-government organisation, Bio-diversity and Community Rights Action Thailand , Withoon Lianchamroon pointed out that rather than carry out extensive testing to isolate GM crops, it would be cheaper to pay compensation to all 2,600 farmers and destroy all the papaya on their farms, because the cost of GMO testing \u2013 Bt1,600 (US$40) per sample \u2013 was prohibitive.\nTwo GM papaya strains are being developed in Thailand, according to Greenpeace: \"Khak Dam\" and \"Khak Nuan\". The plants being grown in Thailand were genetically altered at Cornell University in the US, but details of the agreement were kept secret by the Thai government and Cornell, Greenpeace said. The group believed though, that a royalty fee was to be charged for commercial use of the plants showing the altered genetic code, which was designed to be resistant to ringspot virus.\nBlame.\nAlthough the Network of Northeastern Alternative Agriculture has filed complaints of negligence against the Prime Minister and senior agriculture officials, calling on Khon Kaen police to launch a criminal investigation into how the crops had spread, Greenpeace claims that no charges have been laid against anyone except the two activists.\nMr Somsak has launched an internal investigation to determine how the GM papayas from the experimental fields leaked to taint local crops, while director-general of the Department of Agriculture (DOA), Chakan Saengraksawong, eager to begin further field trials, told \"The Nation\", \"We never sold the GM papaya seeds. If any official is found to have illegally sold the seeds he will surely face punishment.\"\nMr Withoon alleged at the time that a cover-up of the extent of dissemination of the GM variety had occurred. Mr Somsak said that the problem was limited to the Khon Kaen farms, whereas Withoon suspected that many more seedlings had 'escaped', with the thousands of Ubon Ratchathani villagers having been given seedlings by state experimental farms.\nEnvironmentalists pointed to the apparent lack of effectiveness of the Khon Kaen farm's strong fences and round-the-clock security in preventing escape of the GM seedlings.\nStatus of GM in Thailand.\nSince 2001, Thailand has banned importation of GM organisms for commercial non-research purposes, until national regulations can be developed.\nExports to Europe were cancelled in the face of the discovery, affecting Thailand's US$1 million, 3,000 ton papaya export market. The internal market of papaya in Thailand is a hundred times as large.\nAccording to Mr Withoon, most Thai are against GM. Bumrung Kayothabut of the Network of Northeastern Alternative Agriculture, last year said the government was in the grip of multinational companies trying to dominate Thai agriculture through the promotion of GM crops.\nSenator Niran Phitakwatchara linked pro-GM moves by the government to the Thailand-United States Free Trade Agreement (FTA); in the midst of the papaya escapade, the Thai government was reviewing its policy on GM crops, and being lobbied by the US biotech monolith, Monsanto \u2014 who, with Cornell, holds patents on the world's only commercial GM papaya, \"SunUp\", farmed in Hawaii.\nPrime Minister Thaksin said on delaying of a decision on overturning the ban on GM crops, that the government needed more information. \"People, including some scientists, still have no clear understanding of what GM crops really are,\" he told \"The Nation\". He added that bio-safety legislation was needed as a first step, before examining whether or not to allow GM crops, and denied that the FTA was influencing Thai policy-making."}

Lien called his visit a step on the \"historical bus\" toward a \"journey of peace\".\nThe week-long visit takes place 56 years after the KMT withdrawal from mainland China, and signals the end of hostilities between the KMT (or Nationalist Party) and CPC. From 1926 to 1949, the two parties were involved in a bloody civil war resulting in the Nationalist retreat to Taiwan upon their defeat in 1949. \nThis is the highest level exchange between the two parties since KMT leader Chiang Kai-shek and CPC leader Mao Zedong met in Chongqing at the end of the Second Sino-Japanese War in August 1945. Chiang, then the Chinese head of state, and Mao, then a guerrila leader, tried to negotiate a truce at the meeting. The negotiations fails and all-out war soon ensued.\nLien called on the Taiwanese (ROC) government, led the independence-leaning President Chen Shui-bian, to follow his meeting with more efforts at peacemaking and suppression of the independence movement. \"I believe the door has been opened,\" said Lien. \"How to walk towards a new future, towards a new outlook - I think the ruling party must shoulder this responsibility.\" \n\"This is a historic meeting between the leaders of our two parties,\" Hu said after the historic televised handshake with Lien on Friday marking the formal end of hostilities. \"As long as both sides place importance on the interests of the Chinese nation, on the common prosperity of the compatriots on both sides of the strait, we will be able to overcome our differences.\" Lien's visit to mainland China was in part prompted by the mainland National People's Congress's recent passage of a law against the possible secession by Taiwan, including the possible use of \"nonpeaceful means\" which could imply military force, a move that has increased tension between their two countries.\nLien's visit to mainland China was strongly opposed by the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Chairman Su Tseng-chang, who expressed both \"tears\" and \"rage\" at the stance taken by Lien.

The project is expected to cost $6.4 million and one of the main investors is Alice Coltrane, wife of jazz great John Coltrane.\nThe family theme park, called \"Disneyland on the Ganges\" by the \"BBC News\" article, could probably be better compared to Disney's Epcot, since both feature an educational, interactive multimedia experience. Billed as the \"world's biggest-ever mythological theme park\", its purpose is to instruct the masses of Indian pilgrims who come to bathe in the Ganges with tales about the exploits of such Hindu gods as Rama, Vishnu, and Hanuman.\nThe focus is to be educational, not religious. \"We\u2019re not doing this as a religious project,\" said Sagar to \"India-West\" in an interview last September. \"It\u2019s not propaganda. We want to make it fun, a place where people can learn the Indian stories,\" a place that can appeal not only to Hindus but people of other religious faiths as well.\n\"The Hindu religion is well suited to something like this, religions like Islam are not allowed to depict forms but we have many different forms and representations of Gods,\" Sagar said in last week's BBC interview.\nThe name Ganga-Dham comes from the Indian words Ganga, for the Ganges, and Dham, meaning \"place\" or \"abode\". The park is to be built on 25 acres of land in the holy town of Haridwar, in the foothills of the Himalayas, where an estimated 18 million pilgrims a year come to ritually cleanse themselves in the river. The god Vishnu is said by legend to have left his footprint in the town.\nThe company behind this project is the Sagar Group. Shiv's grandfather Ramanand Sagar established a film company, Sagar Art, in 1950 and went on to make 25 films and some hugely popular serials for Indian television. Most notably, Sagar Art produced the groundbreaking TV mythological serial \"Ramayan\", about the Hindu god Rama. Starting in 1987, the series went on to attract worldwide attention and claim as many as 650 million viewers over a period of several years. Images and songs from their TV serials will be incorporated into the park to increase the popular draw and build on the tradition of reverence toward the Hindu gods that the series is known for.\nThe project has also attracted some criticism, by some who feel that the site next to the holy river Ganges is inappropriate for building, and others who do not appreciate the project's light-hearted take toward the Hindu pantheon, which they find disrespectful. However, an important hurdle has been cleared with the official support of the state government of Uttaranchal, and positive comments have been received from other interested parties who favor spreading the knowledge of Hindu philosophy by popular means.\nThere are other difficulties that still must be addressed, for example, a lack of infrastructure in the area to support tourism. But the Sagar Group stands to profit as they already have a Sagar Ganga Resort in the area.\nThe parts of the planned site, as described on the Sagar Group's website, are:\nAlso places are to be provided for visiting non-resident Indians (NRIs) to set up \"remote poojas\" and other rituals over the Internet.\nConstruction is planned to begin later this year for completion by 2007, specifically timed to be ready for the major Kumbh Mela religious festival in 2010, which is expected to draw as many as 50 million or more visitors to the area.\nSome of the park proceeds are said to be set aside for various charities. If the park is successful, the Sagar Group plans to build similar Dhams around the world, in Asia, Oceania, South America, or perhaps even in places such as London, England; Los Angeles, California or Orlando, Florida in the United States."}

Some people also called for the withdrawal of Romanian troops from Iraq, yelling, \"Troops out!\" and waving banners saying, \"It is not our war\" and \"Don't let them die!\", alongside photos of the three journalists.\nMany Romanians also prayed for the release of the journalists, especially since this weekend is Easter for those of Romanian Orthodox religion, which make up 86% of the population. Some of the demonstrators marched to Victoria Palace (\"Palatul Victoriei\"), the government headquarters, where they quietly prayed for the journalists.

Photographs were taken late last year by the (ESO) in Chile, but it has taken since then to confirm that the body is indeed a planet \u2014 five times the size of Jupiter, the largest planet that orbits our own sun. \nExtra-solar planets such as this have been detected before, but never by direct observation \u2014 their presence has always been inferred from aberrant behaviour of the star they circulate around.\n\"Among the most essential quests of modern astronomers, taking direct images of planets outside of our solar system is certainly up there among chart-toppers,\" says the ESO, in a press release given to verify the status of the object.\nThe newly imaged planet orbits a brown dwarf star known to scientists as 2M1207, at a distance that is nearly twice as far as that of Neptune from our own sun \u2014 making the planet much too cold for lifeforms such as those on Earth. Detection of Earth-like planets is still years away, according to the ESO, because they are too faint for current equipment to detect.\nThe scientists say that the planet presents a valuable opportunity nonetheless, as it is much younger than those in our own system, at only \"a few tens of millions of years old\".\n\"Moreover, as the first tens of millions of years are considered to have been a critical period in the formation of Earth and of our own solar system, the study of nearby young planetary systems provides astronomers with invaluable insight on our own origins.\"\nSuns are understood to form when matter collapses strongly under its own gravity, while planets form later by accretion, in matter orbiting a sun.\nPhotographs of what was thought to be an extra-solar planet were announced earlier this month. However scientists now state that the size of that planet might be much larger than originally announced, thus allowing a chance that the object might instead be a small star."}

The closure eliminated 190 jobs in the small town of Jonqui\u00e8re, Quebec. Wal-Mart Canada spokesman Kevin Groh said the store shut at noon Friday rather than the planned date of May 6 because it no longer had any merchandise.\nMichael J. Fraser, the union's national director in Canada, said: \"Wal-Mart is trying to send a message to the rest of their employees that if they join a union the same thing could happen to them.\" The union will be filing unfair labor practice charges against Wal-Mart in Quebec. \nThe United Food and Commercial Workers union has organizing drives in at least 25 Canadian stores.

Scott said that it was the union who walked away from negotiations; however, Fraser said that Walmart walked away from the talks, shutting down the store to avoid submitting to arbitration."}

Some of the opposition leaders who were targeted are said to have been unarmed or even found by security forces in their homes, and police have fought in fiery pitched battles against rioters for days, employing tear gas behind burning barricades. At least 40 Togolese citizens have been killed.\nThe elections were won by Faure Gnassingb\u00e9, son of the previous leader Gnassingb\u00e9 Eyad\u00e9ma, who held power in Togo for about 38 years before his death on February 5, 2005. The army appointed his son as his successor and the country's leader, but regional opposition forced him to step down and seek free elections.\nThe preliminary count indicates that 60% of the vote went to Faure Gnassingb\u00e9, a 38-year-old Master of Business Administration (MBA) from Yale University and son of the former President. An additional 38% went to his chief opponent, 74-year-old Emmanual Bob-Akitani, who was endorsed by a six-party coalition and opposition leader Harry Olympio. Further violence is expected as the official vote tally and announcement of results comes within a few days.\n\"Just after the [preliminary] results were announced the red berets [commandos] went out into the streets and started shooting at the boys,\" said Marthe, who fled to a U.N. refugee camp in Benin to escape the fighting. \"They only shot at the boys. They ransacked shops and blamed the youths, who were unarmed,\" she continued in her Reuters interview. More than 11,500 Togolese have fled from their country and taken up temporary residence in Benin and Ghana since the elections, according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).\nThe opposition party claims that 100 people have been killed in the ongoing violence that passed through Lome and other villages. Togo's Human Rights League has verified the deaths of at least 40, and the wounding of many others.\n\"Violence is not the way to deal with democracy,\" said Mohammed Ibn Chambas, executive secretary of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS). \"We think the way forward is for Togolese to use dialogue, and to sit down and negotiate.\" ECOWAS has certified the elections as free from interference, a decision that some countries such as France have accepted, but the United States continues to question the fairness of the outcome.\nGermany protested after its cultural center, the Goethe Institute, was burned down in Lom\u00e9. The Togolese government has accused Germany of aiding the opposition, and former interior minister Francois Boko (who was fired earlier for trying to postpone the election due to fears of violence) has sought refuge in the German embassy. Togo is a former German colony, but the official language of the country is French, since it was passed to Britain and France in 1918 and only gained its independence in 1960.\nGnassingb\u00e9 has offered to form a new unity government, incorporating voices from the opposition, but their leaders turned down the offer, claiming that the election was fraudulent and stolen.\n\"If they refuse tomorrow, I hope that they will decide to join us the next day,\" said Gnassingb\u00e9 to France's \"Le Monde\" in their Friday edition. \"Reconciliation is a long process. You can't jump overnight from a regime that lasted for 38 years to a new one,\" he continued."}

A delegation of five students is said to have traveled from Yaound\u00e9 One to UB, instigating the strike at the second university.\nThe strikes at UB turned violent after the University Registrar, Herbert Nganjo Endeley, failed to calm the students. Police tried to disperse the students with tear gas, but were pelted by stones in retaliation. Chaos ensued, with the police also throwing stones, bludgeoning and separating the students, turning water cannons on them, raiding their residence hostels, and performing numerous arrests. The students responded by protesting, erecting barricades and destroying school property and vehicles. Several students and police were hospitalized during days of fighting.\nThe students were shot on Thursday in different incidents between 14:30 and 15:00 local time in Molyko \u2014 both were reported to be killed instantly. One student, Embwam Aloysius, a level 400 student of Environmental Science, received a bullet in the head, while the other student, Gilbert Nforlem, a masters degree Geology student, was shot in the chest.

He first helped fellow Chicago resident Irna Phillips, the \"Queen of the Soap Opera,\" write the soap opera \"As the World Turns\" in the late 1950s. The two forged a partnership which lasted for much of the following decade. Bell helped create \"Another World\" with Phillips, and then wrote Phillips' creation \"Days of Our Lives\" from 1966 to 1975.\nThe ratings for \"Days of Our Lives\" rose to near the top of the daytime rankings in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Bell then became a hot commodity, and scripted a soap pilot of his own. With the help of his wife, Chicago talk show host Lee Phillip Bell, he pitched \"The Young and the Restless\" to CBS executives, which agreed to air the show starting in 1973. Like \"Days of Our Lives\", \"The Young and the Restless\" focused primarily on young, beautiful characters, while still maintaining balance throughout the rest of the cast.

In 1988, \"The Young and the Restless\" became the highest-rated soap opera on US television, an honor the show continues to hold today.\nThe Bell husband-and-wife team also created \"The Bold and the Beautiful\", a glamorous serial set around the fashion industry in Beverly Hills, in 1987. Bell won three Emmys for his writing on \"The Young and the Restless\", and one for \"Days of Our Lives\". Bell won five more Emmys for producing the latter serial.\nAt the time of his death, Bell was battling Alzheimer's disease. He had three children, William Jr., Bradley, and Lauralee; all three of his children had various jobs on his soaps. William Jr. is president of Bell-Phillip Television Productions, Inc., Bradley is the executive producer and head writer of \"The Bold and the Beautiful\", and Lauralee plays Christine Williams on \"The Young and the Restless\".\nSources.\n "}

Those efforts came to a head today with the official May 1 start of jury duty by more than 27,000 newly qualified jurors. According to \"People's Daily\", \"It is the first time in Chinese history that the people's juries are appointed in a uniformed way by the people's congresses at all levels.\"\nTwo jurors and a judge will be sitting on each three-person panel, and decide both criminal and civil cases. The juries will be available when requested by litigants and also in cases \"with considerable social repercussions\", which appears to mean major cases. Appeals cases will be heard only by judges.\nThe jurors are not chosen for each trial but will serve a five-year term in the jury pool working on different cases from time to time.\nJurors have been provided for in the Chinese Constitution since 1954, but their role in the system was not well-defined by law until now.\nThe changes to the jury system are part of a long-term planned reform of China's judicial system that was announced in 1999 by China's top judge, Xiao Yang. In addition to jury reforms, the plan addressed trial procedures and court structure and supervision. The goal was to \"perfect the socialist judicial system with Chinese characteristics...in accordance with the Constitution and laws, and [without] judicial independence and supremacy, which exist in many Western countries,\" according to Xiao Yang as reported by the \"People's Daily\" in 1999.\n\"Court reform represents a major part of China's reform of the judicial system and political restructuring. The essence of judicial reform is judicial fairness, which is crucial to the country's rule of law,\" Xiao Yang said back then.\nIn August 2004, the 10th National People's Congress (NPC) Standing Committee approved a \"resolution on improving the people's jury system\", which took effect today. The system specifies that either by recommendation of local work units or by self-application, potential jurors can take qualifying examinations and be presented to standing committees of the NPC for appointment as jurors. \nThe first batch of 1,342 jurors were tested in Beijing under the new law on April 23, 2005. Those who were certified to begin service on May 1 are said to \"participate in all hearing activities of people's courts according to the law, enjoying the same rights as do the judges except that for a presiding judge after their assumption of the post,\" according to the \"People's Daily\".\n\"This is an important move to upgrade and strengthen the system of people's jurors,\" Xiao Long of Beijing People's Court said to \"China Daily\" on April 24. \"The implementation of the NPC's decision will add more transparency and justness to the country's judicial system,\" he added.\nChina has one of the world's largest prison systems with over 1 million prisoners, similar to Russia. It has received criticism over the years from the U.S. State Department and others for its arbitrariness and its treatment of political prisoners. The United States, however, is the world's largest jailer, with a staggering 2 million prison inmates, out of 9 million total around the entire globe. A full 70% of U.S. prison terms are drug-related.\nSources.\n "}

The ship was built in 1914, two years after the Titanic, but unlike the more famous luxury liner, Doulos has over 90 years of safe sailing to her credit. This \"Grand Old Lady of the Sea\" has undergone several periods of rebuilding and expansion throughout the 20th century and sailed under three different names, before being purchased by a Christian missionary group, (OM), in 1977 and converted for their use.\nDoulos bills itself as \"the world's largest floating book fair\", and carries half a million books which represent about 6,000 distinct titles, which are donated and sold for modest fees to support the vessel's operation. The books represent Christian literature and educational material in various languages. Sailing from port to port throughout Asia and Africa, the crew of the Doulos sometimes finds itself faced with local restrictions against the sale of Christian literature, which it handles by separating the sacred books from the secular with a canvas divider, and the guards who are sent to control access to the banned books.\nMost places visited by the Doulos and its sister ship (which travels North and South America) receive them with an enthusiastic welcome. \"Most places we visit don't have Borders or Barnes and Noble,\" said Lane Powell, publications editor for OM. \"In other countries literature is more highly valued and this can be the biggest thing in town,\" Powell continued in his interview with ASSIST News Service. \"People line up one to two miles in some parts of the world. We have 6,000 people coming on the Logos II in one day.\"\nThe OM website claims that, since 1970, the two ships have together reached 30 million people in 140 countries, in 435 ports around the world. The crews themselves are also quite international in character, with volunteers from 50 different countries. Powell gives credit to their shared Christian background for their ability to get along with each other despite their differences. The names of their ships also have Christian meaning: \"doulos\" means \"servant\" and \"logos\" means \"word\", as in holy scripture.\nThe ship recently sailed to Jordan, Lebanon, and Egypt before coming to the Gulf of Oman, and docking in its Sultan Qaboos port, where it was received in style by the Tourism Minister Rajiha bint Abdulameer bin Ali, one of three female ministers in the cabinet. Oman is the only country in the Gulf to have its own tourism ministry, created last year to encourage visitors to come partake in Omani life and culture.\nSaid bin Ali to the \"\", \"We are absolutely delighted to have a roving library second to none, busy inculcating reading habits among people at a time when it matters most.\"\nAlso speaking to the \"Daily Times\", Murthadha Hassan Ali said, \"The importance of such a visit can't be over-emphasised in days when reading habits are waning and people are swarming restaurants as if we were born only to eat... Book remains your best companion, TV or no TV.\" Ali described himself as a \"compulsive book reader\", and wants someday to start a public library in the capital city of Muscat, which currently has none.\nThe 425 foot long (130m) library will weigh anchor and continue its missionary journey starting May 9, with plans to sail to Kenya, on Africa's east coast."}

Although the show kept most of its audience that lead-in \"The Simpsons\" gave, FOX was still fourth out of five major broadcast networks in the half-hour, losing most notably to ABC's hit \"Desperate Housewives\" (UPN, the other major American broadcast network, does not air original programming on Sundays).\nHowever, the season premiere of \"Family Guy\" and the series debut of \"American Dad\" (which helped usher in what the network termed \"The New FOX Sunday\") helped bring FOX to the #2 spot out of five networks in the crucial 18 to 49 demographic, one of the most important to advertisers in the key May sweeps period. \"Sweeps\" occurs four times a year and helps networks and independent affiliates determine how much a fixed amount of time for commercial advertisement will cost (the higher the ratings, the more revenue for the networks selling the time to advertisers).\nOn the whole, \"Family Guy\" averaged a 6.3 rating in the overnights as posted by Zap2It. While the overnight ratings are fairly accurate, the numbers are preliminary and are subject to minor change. One ratings point is equal to 1,096,000 households, as there are now 109,600,000 households in the United States with at least one television. This translates into a little more than 6.9 million households whose sets were tuned into \"Family Guy\", as recorded by the sample of \"Nielsen families,\" who record their viewing habits and contribute to the ratings process the US uses. The use of the word \"share\" in the article means that it is the rough percentage of viewers with their sets on at that hour tuning into a certain program. For example, nine percent of viewers in the United States with their televisions on at 9 P.M. Eastern Daylight Time were tuned to \"Family Guy\".\nThis only added up to a 9 household share for the hour, compared to an 11 share for \"Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent\" on NBC, a 14 share for a CBS \"Hallmark Hall of Fame\" movie of the week (traditionally only aired during the key sweeps periods), and a 23 share for the aforementioned \"Desperate Housewives\". Averaged with the performance of \"American Dad\", a cartoon produced by \"Family Guy\" creator Seth MacFarlane, FOX earned a mere 5.8 rating/9 share for the hour.\nThe episode revolved around a big scheme Peter Griffin, the main character of the series, conjured. To give his wife Lois (who no longer finds him sexually attractive) a second honeymoon in order to \"spice up\" their love life, he pretends to be actor Mel Gibson so they can stay in a new luxury hotel for free. Peter stumbles upon a sequel to the film \"The Passion of the Christ\", and vows to keep the movie from ever seeing the light of day. To get the movie back, Gibson kidnaps Lois and keeps her captive on top of Mount Rushmore, which leads to a scene in which the three battle on top of the monument, in a homage to the film \"North by Northwest\".

The finger, which probably belonged to a woman as it had a long and manicured fingernail, did not belong to any of the restaurant employees. The food supplies were seized by officials to be traced back to its manufacturers, while the restaurant was permitted to open again later with chili prepared from fresh ingredients.\nAftermath.\nWikinews reporter drove his car up to the drive-thru menu and found that chili was still on the menu, at a price of US$1.19 for a small serving. He also witnessed workers unloading supplies from a semi-trailer truck in the restaurant's parking lot, and carting them into the back door of the establishment.\nInitially, county health officials said Ayala was fine and the finger had been cooked, which would have killed any bacteriae in the finger. However, on March 27, officials admitted they were not so sure anymore. Tests were done on the finger to determine this. Dr. Martin Fenstersheib, Santa Clara County's health officer, said that even if the finger was still raw when Ayala bit into it, the risk was low that she would have become infected with anything. However, he advised that Ayala should undergo a series of precautionary follow-up tests.\nSales at Wendy's went down because of the incident. Wendy's International, Inc. (WEN) closed at US$39.43 on Thursday the 22nd, and as the stock exchange was closed for the Good Friday holiday, traders did not weigh in the stock until the next Monday.\nBy Tuesday the 5th of April, officials had still not succeeded in tracking down the owner of the finger. The fingerprint on the detached digit has been run through an FBI database as well as the local criminal database in Santa Clara County, but no matches were found. According to Rich Reneau, who was leading the investigation at the time, the fingerprint was marginal, and the likelihood of finding a match was slim.\nWendy's stock did not go down significantly and was trading at US$39.37 that morning.\nInvestigation centers on Ayala.\nThe next day, on Wednesday the 6th, Las Vegas police searched the home of Anna Ayala. About a dozen officers conducted the search at Ayala's home at Maryland Parkway and Serene Street at about 4 p.m. local time (23:00 UTC), according to witnesses at the scene. Ayala and other residents were handcuffed and brought out of the house. Ayala said that her teenage daughter, Genesis Reyes, had torn shoulder ligaments as a result of the search. The Las Vegas Review-Journal ran a photo of Reyes wearing a sling in their Friday edition. In San Jose, police spokeswoman Gina Tepoorten confirmed to reporters that investigators had served the warrant in cooperation with Las Vegas police on Wednesday, but she refused to reveal specific details about the warrant. By that time, Wendy's was offering a US$50,000 reward for information leading to the source of the finger.\nResearch by the \"Associated Press\" uncovered Ayala's history of lawsuits. Ayala successfully won her suit for medical expenses against the national El Pollo Loco chicken-chain, a previous employer, after her daughter Genesis contracted salmonella poisoning, allegedly from eating at the restaurant. However, Ayala lost another suit against General Motors in 2000 claiming that a wheel fell off her car. She also started a sexual harassment suit against her former boss in 1998. A total of 13 lawsuits in California and Nevada had been filed. Ayala replied the focus should be on Wendy's, and not her record of law suits. Nick Muyo, a spokesman for the San Jose Police department, said not to expect new information in the case for at least a week.\nTwists and turns.\nOn Wednesday the 13th there was a potential new lead in the investigation. A spotted leopard had torn off part of a finger from an owner of exotic animals, Sandy Allman, in Pahrump, Nevada. The portion of Allman's torn off finger was approximately the same size - 1 1/2-inches long. Pahrump is approximately 45 miles away from Las Vegas. Carol Asvestas, who owns an exotic animal sanctuary, told the \"San Jose Mercury News\" she witnessed the leopard tear off the finger. She reported the incident to a hotline run by Wendy's offering the US$50,000 reward. Cindy Carroccio told the \"San Jose Mercury News\" that the finger was not reattached, and that the clinic \"gave it back to her (Allman) in a little bag of ice.\" On the same day the lead was announced, Ayala decided to drop her lawsuit against Wendy's, due to emotional stress.\nHowever, when Allman's prints were sent to San Jose police, they didn't match. Two days later, on Friday the 15th, Wendy's doubled the reward to US$100,000. The company revealed that employees had passed polygraph tests. Wendy's continues to claim that there is no evidence that the finger ever entered their supply chain, pointing to a lack of any accidents among the workers at their suppliers. Wendy's tip line had received reports from across the United States, from \"folks who either have lost a finger, or know somebody who lost a finger,\" San Jose police Sgt. Nick Muyo told the \"Associated Press\".\nAyala arrested.\nOn Thursday the 21st of April, Anna Ayala was arrested at or near her home in Las Vegas on Thursday evening, in connection with the case, shortly after Wendy's finished its own internal investigation. According to court documents, she has been charged with one count of attempted grand larceny related to the chili case, and one count of grand larceny in an unrelated real estate deal, and is being held without bail in Clark County, Nevada, pending extradition. A press conference by the San Jose Police and Wendy's was held on Friday, April 22, at 13:00 PDT. The charge related to the case states the finger could not have been prepared at Wendy's, where the chili is heated to 170 degrees for 3 hours. There is also an inconsistency in Ayala's account of finding the finger and claiming it caused her to vomit compared with police saying there was no vomit at the scene. The incident has caused Wendy's 2.5 million dollars worth of damages, which Ayala could be criminally responsible for. Until recently, the San Jose police had not accused Ayala of planting the finger herself.\nThe unrelated charge stems from an incident, also in San Jose, when Ayala allegedly received an $11,000 down payment on a mobile home she did not own.\nAyala was incarcerated at the Clark County Detention Center, awaiting a fugitive review hearing on Tuesday, April 26, 2005, at 7:30 a.m. local time. She was processed and given inmate ID 01964047. Her case number was 05F07229X. Ayala waived extradition at the hearing, and her attorney said they were ready to come to San Jose to defend against the charges.\nAyala transferred to San Jose.\nOn Friday, May 6, 2005, Ayala was transported to San Jose, California. Ayala was booked into the main Santa Clara County jail, and is awaiting arraignment. Ayala will likely be arraigned on Monday or Tuesday at the Santa Clara County Superior Court, according to Santa Clara County Deputy District Attorney David Boyd.\nOn September 9, 2005, Ayala plead guilty to conspiring to file a false claim and attempted grand theft, and will be sentenced on November 2, 2005. She faces up to ten years in prison, and her husband faces up to 13 years behind bars.\nFinger's owner identified.\nUntil the middle of May, the owner of the finger still had not been found. \nBut on , 2005, police announced that they had identified the finger tip as belonging to an associate of Ayala's husband . The associate had lost his finger tip in an industrial accident at an asphalt company in December, 2004. Police had received the information from an undisclosed caller to Wendy's hot-line.\nPhotos related to this incident:\nRecently Edited headlines.\n&lt;DynamicPageList&gt;\ncategory=Chili Finger Incident\ncount=20\nnamespace=main\n&lt;/DynamicPageList&gt;"}

{"id": "9339", "revid": "4460", "url": "https://en.wikinews.org/wiki?curid=9339", "title": "B.C. elections debate fiery but not conclusive", "text": ", \nIn British Columbia, Canada, leadership debates during provincial elections can have a major effect. In 1991, a single sentence during the leadership debate catapulted the then-obscure B.C. Liberal party from no seats for more than a decade to official opposition with 17 seats. In the current election, three television stations plan to broadcast the event live.\nAdriane Carr of the Greens, Carole James of the New Democratic Party (NDP) and Gordon Campbell of the B.C. Liberals left the campaign trail on Monday to prepare for the Leadership debate on Tuesday night. The contestants were heavily prepared, and came into the debate with talking points and notes carefully memorized and at the ready.\nBefore the debate.\nPrior to the debates, it was widely reported that Adriane Carr of the Green party had already won simply by being present. The Green party secured their position in the debate by having a candidate in every riding, 79 candidates in all. With a steadily increasing polling history in elections but no seats in the Legislative Assembly and a minimal campaign budget, the Green party can only benefit from the opportunity to become better known to the BC electorate.\nThe Green Party formed in British Columbia in 1983 as part of the international Green Party network. In the 2001 election, the party achieved 12.4% of the popular vote, but still failed to elect a single Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA).\nCarole James is a newcomer in the leadership role of the NDP. She was elected in 2003 and aims to restore the party to power after they suffered an embarrassing defeat. In 2001, the NDP went from government to opposition with only two seats. A special election raised the expectation of change and voter dissatisfaction when the ruling Liberals were unable, despite high-profile campaigning, to prevent a demoralizing defeat in favour of the NDP candidate. This brought the party up to 3 MLAs. Pundit view of the debate was split on Carole James's best approach; an aggressive approach might win enough interest and respect to gain enough seats to form a government - or backfire and push disaffected voters toward both opponent's parties, while a firm but softer stance would suggest acceptance of the position as opposition with an expectation to pick up about 15 seats in the assembly.\nThe NDP is not the old guard of B.C. political parties, and only formed in 1961 though it traces its lineage back to 1933. It has led the province on multiple occasions in the 1970s and 1990s. However, a series of leadership scandals and the FastCat Fiasco led to the crushing defeat at the hands of the B.C. Liberals in 2001.\nGordon Campbell, the Premier of British Columbia, has the most to lose in such an event and would likely have preferred not to attend at all. An experienced rhetorician with both long service in the Legislative Assembly and in politics in general, he also heads the party which revived itself from obscurity during just such a debate in 1991. Described as a small-c conservative in the nature of Margaret Thatcher, his party's dominance in the assembly did not allow him the confidence to actually present a budget the Liberals had been talking about, and making promises on, for months.\nOne of the oldest parties in the province, the B.C. Liberals are independent of the national Liberal party and its policies. They are a right-of-centre party, being socially moderate and fiscally conservative. The party was in decline for most of the last half of the past century. However, it made a remarkable recovery during the 1990s due to the dissolution of the Social Credit Party. It was greatly helped by its social conservatism and a series of leadership and financial scandals in the NDP. Capitalizing on a split in the ruling party, the Liberals took power in the 2001 election with 77 of 79 assembly seats.\nLeadership debate, 3 May 2005.\nWith tight moderation and a constrained debate format of questions and answers, rebuttals, and open floor debate, the entire event was surprisingly civil as each candidate tried to push the others into social gaffes. The candidates managed to stay on message throughout, though the discourse occasionally broke into the almost spontaneous and provided some of the liveliest discussion in what has begun to seem like a dull campaign, at least by B.C. standards.\nLeading the way into the fray, Campbell pointed to the NDP for leaving the economy and infrastructure of the province in a shambles. \"British Columbia became a have-not province,\" he repeated several times.\nJames hammered back, focusing on broken campaign promises and trust issues. When Campbell pointed to the successes of his party in office, she dismissed the claims. \"We see Mr. Campbell taking credit for things that he had nothing to do with, high commodity prices and low interest rates.\"\nIn the enviable position of watching her opponents digging into each other and not sparing much effort on the Greens, Carr was free to criticize both parties. \"The gap between the rich and the poor has grown to be the biggest in Canada and that's a shameful record,\" she said to Campbell. When James pointed to the privatisation of Healthcare under the Liberals, Carr cut her dead with \"And who started the move to privatisation? It was the NDP who started that move.\"\nThe debate, broadcast live by three stations, did not have any clear winners or losers. Macleans magazine reported that Campbell survived being double-teamed by the other parties, yet he also seemed unable to meet James's challenges or respond to Carr's inquiries with direct answers.\nBritish Columbia election latest.\n&lt;DynamicPageList&gt;\ncategory=British Columbia\ncategory=Elections\ncount=10\n&lt;/DynamicPageList&gt;"}

The laws, which are found to restrict freedom of expression to varying degrees of severity in 48 out of 53 African nations, result in the imprisonment of many political reporters for what they feel is necessary criticism of their governments.\nThe campaign was launched on Monday in Lusaka, the capital city of Zambia. The date was chosen so that the workshops would take place on World Press Freedom Day (Tuesday, May 3). In the nation of Zambia, to take one example, a three-year jail sentence is prescribed for a journalist who defames or ridicules the President or any other prince.\nThe laws are supposed to exist to protect the dignity and reputation of public figures. However, according to some critics, they are used to attack journalists who make personal references to some politicians, and those who allege misconduct or corruption by high public officials, such as heads of state or parliamentarians.\n\"We want to create awareness of these laws and lobby for their repeal in Africa,\" said research manager Kandji Kaitira of the Media Institute of Southern Africa (MISA). \nAccording to the Zimbabwe \"Daily News\", a number of African media groups are taking part in the effort, including World Press Freedom Committee, the Southern African National Editors' Forum, the Southern African Editors' Forum, the Southern African Journalists' Association, Journalistes en Danger (JED) of the Democratic Republic of Congo, the Organisations of the Media in Central Africa, the Media Foundation for West Africa and Media Rights Agenda in Nigeria.\nKenya in Africa, and some countries in South America, have already removed such laws from the books. However, in at least one European Union country, Poland, insulting a head of state remains a crime (see freedom of speech), though the January 5 2005 conviction of Jerzy Urban for having insulted the pope could in principle be overturned by the European Court of Human Rights.\nNegativism in coverage of Africa.\nLast month, the result of an unusual study by 11 former African presidents was announced in a Johannesburg press conference. The former leaders stated that based on their review of certain American outlets for the past decade (1994-2004), coverage was found to be overwhelmingly negative, crisis-driven and dismissive of Africa's democratic progress. The result of this one-sidedness, they claim, actually becomes detrimental to further progress being made by Africa.\n\"Negative perceptions lead to negative outcomes \u2014 lower levels of aid and lower investments,\" said Joaquim Chissano, one-time president of Mozambique, who helped put an end to decades of civil war in his country.\nThe period was chosen because of a trend they saw toward democracy and free markets during that period in diverse nations. Chissano said, \"Coverage of Africa... is, at best, dismissive of the continent's progress and potential... At worst, coverage disregards recent trends towards democratisation, betraying an almost contemptuous lack of interest in the potential and progress being achieved on the continent,\" he said.\nThe \"New York Times\", \"Washington Post\", \"Wall Street Journal\", \"USA Today\" and \"US News and World Report\" were reviewed in the study.\nTen stories the world should hear more about.\nTo focus media awareness on World Press Freedom Day, the U.N. Department of Public Information (DPI) launched a new initiative it calls \"Ten Stories the World Should Hear More About\". These are items that in the strongly expressed opinion of the U.N. spokesman, are critical issues which are not receiving adequate attention by the major media, compared to other stories which are focused on almost exclusively, such as Iraq.\nSome of the stories concern ongoing conflicts and humanitarian crises to which the U.N. is responding, while others concern underreported good news. For example:\n\"Five: Tajikistan, rising from the ashes of civil war. Again, you know, we often complain that while the cliche is that 'no news is good news', when it comes to media and the U.N., 'good news is no news'. Well, the fact is, here is a good news story, formidable challenges in the aftermath of a deadly civil war, and yet a country that is persisting on the road to peace and recovery \u2014 it hardly gets reported.\"\nThe spokesman concluded:\n\"Our staff and the public information staff of the various U.N. agencies are eager to work with you to raise the profile of these topics. We have summaries available of the story behind each of the ten issues on the list... All of them list contact points from whom you can seek further information. We've also posted links to more information sources on our website to help you if the list inspires you. And these are also links to the U.N. officers and agencies concerned with each issue. And if it piques your curiosity sufficiently, we're happy to help by arranging interviews. The staff of DPI and those of other U.N. offices are committed to working with you to help raise the world's awareness of these and other stories that we believe the world needs to know more about. I urge you to use the initiative as a resource, as you go about your tough job, the business of covering the news. After all you are one of the most, perhaps \u2014 we think \u2014 \"the\" most, important source of information about world events.\"\nThe stories are listed on the new Ten Stories space on the U.N. website.\n "}

Plans for the interchange, a standard diamond interchange that also carries State Highway 15 on the west and south approaches, include reversing the flow of traffic on the bridge over I-75, in what is known as a \"diverging diamond interchange\".\nSuch an interchange does not exist in the United States; ODOT based the plan on an interchange in Versailles, France of the same design, introduced to them by a report in a trade magazine. Instead of the standard approach, widening the four-lane bridge to add turn lanes, traffic flow will be reversed between the two sets of ramps, with traffic signals controlling the flow. The only conflicts will be between the two directions of US 224; all turns to and from the ramps will be free-flowing. Traffic will be guided by barriers and islands, preventing errors in movement. As it eliminates left turns across traffic, the accident rate at the interchange is expected to be cut in half. The plan will also be cheaper than a rebuild of the bridge, and will be able to carry more traffic.\nLeft-hand driving is very rare in the United States, but a few freeway-to-freeway interchanges incorporate it. In those cases, rather than being traffic-light controlled, the crossings between opposite directions are separated by bridges. Another related case is the Single Point Urban Interchange, in which opposing streams of left-turning traffic pass each other on the left.\nThe bridge, built in 1956, currently carries about 20,000 vehicles per day. The land west of the interchange, across from downtown Findlay, is being rapidly developed, and plans for the area include a Wal-Mart.\nMayor Tony Iriti of Findlay thinks \"it's a great idea. It's amazing to me that this has never been done before. We'll be written up in all those magazines nobody wants to read.\" Hancock County officials are similarly enthusiastic.\nThe decision on whether to build the interchange will not be made until late summer.\nExternal links.\n "}

As agreed with the European Union as part of accession negotiations, Romania must cease to provide major state aid to mining companies after 2007, when the country will become a member of the EU.

This past week, the 2005 opium harvest was in full view and going full speed in Afghanistan. The cultivators gathering resin from the crop are operating even near the main road through Kandahar and the farmers are out gathering resin from opium poppies in full view.\nLast year 80% of the world's opium came from Afghanistan and production is up over 239% since 2003, according to U.S. government estimates. Afghanistan is the world's largest producer of illegal drugs.\nIn ads, the White House sent out the message that \"drugs fund terrorists\". Doug Wankel, a former U.S. (DEA) official, says the opium industry is \"financing terrorism. It's financing subversive activities. It's financing warlordism... And if it's a threat to the government of Afghanistan, it's a direct threat to the national security interests of the United States.\"\n\"The Bush administration has decided not to destroy the opium crop in Afghanistan,\" stated a U.S. intelligence official returning from Afghanistan in relation to the 60% smaller 2002 crop. The source, who requested that he not be identified, noted \"U.S. forces could destroy the crops using aerial spraying techniques, but no such actions are planned.\"\nU.S. plans to spray the crops were canceled at the request of Afghan President Hamid Karzai, who has called for or \"holy war\", but is concerned that aerial spraying could be harmful to the health of Afghan villagers. The U.S. claims that the spraying would be safe, but is granting Karzai's request.\nKarzai has indicated that he may change his mind if other U.S. strategies fail to halt the opium. Congress budgeted $774 million for anti-drug operations in Afghanistan just this year.\nEstimating the value of the crop.\nThe CIA reports in \"From Flowers to Heroin that\" it takes 10\u00a0kg of opium to make 1\u00a0kg of 90% pure heroin. The CIA states that impurities are introduced into the processed heroin before it hits the street, making the purity of the end consumer product about 40%. That implies that 10\u00a0kg of opium makes about 2.25\u00a0kg of 40% pure heroin.\nThe Guardian reports that the 2002 opium harvest was 3400 metric tons. Using the conversion supplied by the CIA, 2002's 3400 opium harvest could be converted into 765 metric tons of heroin. According to the International Narcotics Control Board, the 2003 opium harvest was 3600 metric tons. Using the estimated 239% increase of the present harvast over 2003, it means that the 2005 harvest is about 8600 metric tons.\nThe 2002 street price of heroin in the UK was about 60 \u00a3 per GRAM, or (assuming the present 1.89 USD to 1 \u00a3 exchange) 113.40 USD per GRAM. As the supply goes up the price will come down some, so for this calculation only the 2002 figures will be used. If all the opium harvest is converted into heroin and all of it is sold at the UK street price, the total street value of the harvest is 86.7 billion USD. (765 metric tons x 1000\u00a0kg/metric ton x 1000 grams/kg x 113.4 USD/gram = about 86.7 billion USD.) To the extent the 2002 numbers are valid today, the street value of the 2005 harvest should be roughly twice the street value of the 2002 harvest, about 173 billion USD.\nTo put these numbers in perspective, the total market capitalization of Ford, General Motors and Daimler Chrysler combined is about 76 billion USD. The total market capitalization of Toyota and Honda combined is about 167 billion USD.\nNo Statement by the Financial Action Task Force.\nThe Financial Action Task Force (FATF) was formed to promote harmonization of international antimoney laundering (AML) laws. Despite the fact that tens of billions of USDs are generated from the Afgan opium harvest alone, the FATF has not added Afghanistan to its blacklist of uncooperative nations. One has to wonder, therefore, what the poppy farmers are doing with their share of the money that escapes the notice of the banking system and the FATF.\nSources.\nThursday, March 28, 2002"}

Rogers, retired chemist who pioneered in the use of thermal analysis to characterize explosives, died on March 8, 2005 at the age of 77 after a long illness. \nRogers was born July 21, 1927 in Albuquerque NM, but his family soon moved to California to find work. When his father died in an industrial accident on young Rogers' thirteenth birthday, he and his mother were left in Bakersfield with no means of support in the depression years. Rogers took on a number of odd jobs to bring in money: playing the horn in a dance band, ushering at the local theater, and working in a print shop.\nIn 1945 he enlisted in the U.S Navy and served as a radar technician during World War II. Thanks to the GI bill, Rogers was able to complete his education at the University of Arizona, majoring in chemistry. Upon graduation in 1948 his first job was with the Arizona Agricultural Experimental Station. There he built a thermal analysis instrument to study soils, and this experience brought him to Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) in late 1951.\nAt LANL Rogers became a group leader of an explosives research-and-development group and was elected Laboratory Fellow in 1981. He later worked for the International Technology division, retiring in 1988. He served on the Department of the Air Force Scientific Advisory Board from 1987 until 1992 with the equivalent rank of Lt. General, receiving their Distinguished Service Award. He received other awards and recognitions from LANL and professional organizations. \nAlthough much of Rogers' research at LANL had military applications including the characterization of exotic explosives for munitions, he was always concerned with explosives safety and chemical hazards. One of his published research results has been incorporated into a standard method for the screening of reactive materials (ASTM method E698). Today this method is used worldwide to obtain reaction rate constants for energetic materials, a necessary first step in avoiding thermal explosions.\nUntil he retired Rogers was an editor for the two scientific journals, Thermochimica Acta and the Journal of Energetic Materials, and throughout his career he participated in conferences and symposia related to his chosen field. His ground-breaking work in thermal analysis\u2014particularly differential scanning calorimetry\u2014demonstrated the effectiveness of these techniques for characterizing energetic materials with only a few milligrams of sample. A relevant list of Rogers' scientific publications can be found on the Web (Explosives Science).\nRogers was also an accomplished amateur archaeologist who did research on the chemistry of deposits and artifacts of interest in archaeology and geochronology. In 1978 he was invited to become Director of Chemical Research for the Shroud of Turin Research Project (STURP), whose primary goal was to determine the scientific properties of the image on the Shroud of Turin, and what might have caused it. The shroud was a linen fabric purported to be the burial cloth of Jesus of Nazareth. \nFor many people the shroud study proved disappointing when the initial carbon dating results placed the production of the fabric at between 1260 and 1390 AD, indicating that the shroud was a fake. However, about a year before his death Rogers found evidence that challenged the carbon-14 dating results. Although weakened by illness, he performed forensic work (Thermochimica Acta 425 (2005), 189-194 ) revealing that the material used in the carbon dating was not sampled from the original fabric, but from a part of the shroud that had been rewoven in medieval times. Rogers' work also indicated that the original shroud was much older than the age determined through carbon-14 analysis; but the question remains open as to whether it was in fact the burial cloth of the historic Jesus.\nAfter retiring from LANL Rogers continued to work on the Shroud project, and with his wife Joan he also found time to enjoy hiking in the great outdoors as well as to train dogs for search and rescue operations. He is survived by his wife Joan; daughter Amy Canzona and her husband Tony; step-daughters Dawn Janney and Lauren McGavran and her husband Harry; grandson Kenneth; great-grandson Mark; cousin Bob and other family members; many very special friends; and coonhound Clancy."}

The Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) announced the migration on Thursday, April 28.\nThe announcement is significant in terms of the sheer size of the bank. \"This is the biggest Linux implementation in China,\" said General Manager Claude Zhou of Turbolinux China. The ICBC serves more than 108 million customers and manages their combined assets of US$640 billion (5.3 trillion renminbi). Its 390,000 employees are scattered across 20,000 branch offices throughout China. The planned deployment will be undertaken in steps and is estimated to take three years. \nZhou described the reasons for the planned migration as the stability and security of Linux. Nielse Jiang, an analyst at IDC, also attributed the switch to insufficient support by the SCO Group. \"In China, SCO Unix offers very weak support for customers; they have so few employees,\" Jiang said.\nICBC selected Turbolinux over its various competitors, including Microsoft Corporation, in part because of its need to maintain its custom-written Unix-based software. The increasing scalability and stability of Linux also were factors in the decision.\nTurbolinux has been China's number one source of Linux for the past 4 years. In 2004, Turbolinux held 62.0% of the Chinese server market, and also had 24.9% desktop market share, a much larger portion of desktop share than GNU/Linux holds in the United States.\nTurbolinux is an Asian-Pacific distribution of Linux with its corporate headquarters located in Tokyo, Japan, and offices in China and the United States. Turbolinux claims that its \"Turbolinux 7 Server was the first-ever to conform to Internationalization standards to help simplify development of applications that require multiple language support \u2014 a critical requirement for software distributed globally,\" and supports the use of its software in the Japanese and Chinese languages.\nTurbolinux was also used as the operating system of choice for China's recent supercomputer, the Dawning 4000A. With its unveiling on November 15, 2004, China became the third country, after the U.S. and Japan, to surpass the 10 teraflops level of performance in a single machine. The computer, located in Shanghai Supercomputing Center, contains 2,560 64-bit Opteron processors from AMD, each running at 2.2 GHz, and at its introduction was the 10th fastest computer in the world.\nTurbolinux is being spread throughout China, both throughout government and the business sector, in key areas such as transportation and telecommunications. In December 2004, ZTE Corporation, the largest telecommunications manufacturer in China, partnered with Hewlett-Packard and Turbolinux to bring the benefits of GNU/Linux software to that industry.\nThe other three largest banks in China have either already announced plans for major migrations to GNU/Linux servers running various distributions, or are expected to do so later this year."}

In a statement released by the Marine Corps: \"He has determined that the actions of the Marine in question were consistent with the established rules of engagement, the law of armed conflict and the Marine's inherent right of self-defense.\" He will now not face a court martial.\nIn a videotape of the event, the Camp Pendleton U.S. marine raises his weapon and fires into the body of a Iraqi lying up against a wall in a mosque. When the Marine approached the wounded man, the marine is heard on the videotape saying, \"He's f****** faking he's dead; he's faking he's f****** dead.\" Then he fired his rifle point-blank at the man's head, at which point a companion said, \"Well, he's dead now.\"\nThe shootings occurred inside a mosque during a U.S. offensive that led to house-to-house fighting in southern Falluja last November. A television journalist embedded with the Marines recorded the killing on videotape.\nThe man killed was one of several Iraqi insurgents who had been wounded in fighting and then disarmed by marines, who then moved on leaving the wounded men in the mosque. The next day a second line of marines moved through the area, who fought with more insurgents. Due to the time that had passed since the first wave of marines, the second line assumed that any buildings could have been re-occupied by insurgents. The corporal found wounded men in the mosque when they searched it. At that moment marines from the first line of attack were approaching the mosque, among them the journalist, who had also been there the first time. As they approached, they heard three shots. When they entered the journalist taped what he saw, the same people who were left there, disarmed. Some were still alive and one marine thought a man lying on the ground was a threat because one of his arms was not clearly visible, so he could be hiding a weapon. However, instead of keeping him covered so another could search him he shot him, while the journalist was taping it. When the marine saw this and heard that these men had already been disarmed before he shouted that he didn't know that.\nIn sworn testimony, the corporal said he thought the people in the mosque were a threat. Investigators who considered a videotape of the shooting agreed. A known tactic of anti-Iraqi forces (AIF) is to feign injury or death, and the marine could reasonably claim they were still a threat.\nThe Marines said in a press release:\n\"The evidence supports the conclusion that the shooting of all three AIF by the corporal during the assault on the mosque was consistent with the ROE (rules of engagement). The evidence indicates that based on the actions of those AIF, the corporal reasonably believed that they posed a hostile threat to him and his fellow Marines and justifiably fired in self-defense. The enhanced videotape of the shooting supports the corporal's claim that the wounded AIF was concealing his left arm behind his head. While it is not clear whether the AIF in the videotape made any overtly threatening gestures, it is clear that the Marines of 3/1, to include the corporal, were aware that feigning death was a common enemy TTP (tactics, techniques &amp; procedures). Accordingly, it was reasonable to believe that the corporal fired on the AIF after reasonably believing that the individual was committing a hostile act by exhibiting a known enemy TTP (feigning death and subsequently moving his concealed arm). Based on all the evidence in the case, and the rules of engagement that were in effect at the time, it is clear that the corporal could have reasonably believed that the AIF shown in the videotape posed a hostile threat justifying his use of deadly force.\"\nKevin Sites, the NBC TV journalist who taped the event as \"pool\" footage, was embedded with the 3rd Battalion, 1st Marine Regiment when it neutralized Fallujah. The incident in the mosque raised considerable controversy over whether embedded journalists should maintain a neutral point of view. The unedited footage was aired extensively by Al Jazeera over the months following the incident. \nSharif Hikmat Nashashibi of the Arab Media Watch said the footage would support the idea in the Middle East that the prime concern of US forces is not the welfare of Iraqis.\nIn the USA, however, the shooting itself was not shown because NBC considered it too shocking. Now that Sites is no longer embedded he wants to bring the whole story out in the open. \nDespite the fact that Sites introduced the footage with a long explanation of how the soldiers were under a lot of stress, which could easily cloud their judgement, he received thousands of hate-mails per day and even death-threats\nSites later responded to the criticism in an open letter to the regiment in his weblog."}

Many of the bigger technology advances have gained high praise, but, they point out, Microsoft Longhorn is also expected to have many of these advantages when it is released, expected in late 2006.

The director of ANT, Marius Critonescu, said that the branding exercise will be \"a significant component of the Romania's development as a new tourist destination of international level.\" He also added that the development of an integrated brand for Romanian tourism will promote a more positive image for the country, thereby increasing the number of tourists and investors. In recent times, there has been quite a lot of investment in \"national branding\", especially in the field of tourism, as most marketing experts believe that branding for a product or a country is theoretically the same thing, and that the same strategies and approach should be used for both.\nConcerning the Romanian tourism rebranding, international tourism and marketing expert James MacGregor stated that, \"We have to touch the hearts and souls of the contemporary tourists who no longer travel for a simple beach or ski track. They want to live a self-knowledge experience that is truly uplifting and will leave unforgettable memories. The brand must show them not what they will see or do as tourists but what they will feel when visiting Romania.\""}

If successful, the reactor will be put to use destroying the large VX nerve gas stockpiles stored at the facility over the course of the next two years. \nAfter the disposal project experienced several delays, the facility announced it would begin pumping VX into a completed disposal unit for testing. The unit consists of a chemical reactor in which the VX will be mixed with water and sodium hydroxide, heated to 194\u00b0F while mixed with paddles. The resulting chemical, called hydrolysate, is chemically similar to commercial drain cleaners and has similar properties. If the test is successfully completed , the unit will continue processing the VX until the entire stockpile has been neutralized, a process projected to take two years.

The contractor for the final component of this disposal would be the DuPont Corporation.\nBackground on Newport Chemical Depot (NCD).\nNCD is a bulk chemical storage and destruction facility in west central Indiana, thirty miles north of Terre Haute. Originally founded during World War II to produce RDX, a conventional explosive, it later became a site for chemical weapons manufacturing during the Cold War. It is now used to securely store and gradually neutralize part of the US stockpile of VX. \nVX was manufactured by the U.S. in the 1950s and 60's as a deterrent to possible Soviet Union use. It was never deployed, and the manufacture was halted in 1969 after an order signed by then-president Richard Nixon.\nIn 1999, the Army announced it awarded a disposal contract to Parsons Infrastructure &amp; Technology, Inc., a business unit of Parsons Corporation. Some 220 civilian Parsons employees work at the facility, which is supervised by an Army officer reporting to the U.S. Army Chemical Materials Agency, and a board of civilian government overseers called the Indiana Citizens' Advisory Commission, some of whose members are appointed by the state governor.\nSecurity at the facility is controversial. A private security service, supplemented by a complement of Indiana National Guard soldiers, guarded the facility until April 14, 2005, when the soldiers were withdrawn. An Indianapolis television station has questioned security measures in some of its special reports.\nSources.\n "}

The test bed uses a combination of materials including play sand for children's sandboxes, diatomaceous earth for swimming pool filters, and mortar clay powder.\nOpportunity dug into soft sand to wheel-hub depth as it drove over a dune about one-third meter (one foot) tall and 2.5 meters (8 feet) wide. \"We've climbed over dozens of ripples, but this one is different in that it seems to be a little taller and to have a steeper slope, about 15 degrees on part of its face,\" said Mark Maimone, a Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) rover mobility engineer. Tests will be conducted using an Earth-bound twin of the rover and the simulated Martian dune to determine how to best maneuver Opportunity out of the predicament before transmitting commands to the actual vehicle.\n\"We choose to proceed cautiously, so we don't expect to begin actually driving out of the dune before next week, possibly later,\" said Jim Erickson, rover project manager at JPL. \"Both Opportunity and Spirit have already provided many more months of scientific exploration than anyone expected. By taking good care of them, we hope to keep them exploring for more months to come. Tests so far have sustained our optimism about Opportunity's ability to drive out of this dune, but we have more testing ahead to understand how robust that capability is.\"\nEngineers constructed a simulated dune last week using sand that was already at JPL's rover testing facility and put a test rover into a similar dug-in position. The test rover had no difficulty driving away, even when sunk belly-deep. However, that sand offered better traction than the finer, looser material that appears to make up the surface at Opportunity's current position. \"We needed to do tests using material more like what Opportunity is in, something that has a fluffier texture and cakes onto the wheels,\" said JPL rover engineer Rick Welch, who is leading the tests.\nBased on images of wheels and wheel tracks from Mars, Dr. Robert Sullivan of Cornell University, a rover science team member, working with engineers in the JPL test bed, helped match the properties of the test sand as closely as possible with those of the sand beneath Opportunity, \"We found that when the wheels dig in, the material we're using does stick to the wheels and fills the gaps between the cleats, but it doesn't stick when you're just driving over it. That's good because it's the same as what we see in the images from Opportunity,\" Sullivan said. Experiments show that the test rover, after some initial wheel-spinning, can drive out of the more powdery material. \nThe team went to several home supply and hardware stores to find enough bags and boxes of the ingredients to make more than 2 tons of the simulated Mars sand for the more realistic mobility tests, according to JPL rover mobility engineer Jeff Biesiadeckia.\nSources.\n "}

This is because its policies and stance on key issues are generally against that of the other coalition parties, especially the National Liberal Party and the Democratic Party.

Contudo, os curdos queixaram-se, desde a data de in\u00edcio do programa, de que eles n\u00e3o recebiam essas receitas adequadamente.\nHouve alega\u00e7\u00f5es de que o escrit\u00f3rio no Cairo da Organiza\u00e7\u00e3o Mundial da Sa\u00fade, foi dirigido por um indiv\u00edduo que supostamente recebeu contratos de venda de petr\u00f3leo, para em troca, paralisar a constru\u00e7\u00e3o de um novo hospital geral para a cidade curda de Sulaymaniyah, embora os fundos para a constru\u00e7\u00e3o desse hospital estivessem dispon\u00edveis desde 1988.\nA partir de Abril de 2004 , o programa come\u00e7ou a ser alvo de acusa\u00e7\u00f5es dos c\u00edrculos conservadores norte-americanos, de que parte do dinheiro era ilegalmente desviada para o governo iraquiano. Foram feitas acusa\u00e7\u00f5es de que parte do dinheiro era usada para subornar funcion\u00e1rios da ONU e at\u00e9 mesmo o secret\u00e1rio-geral Kofi Annan.\nSegundo o relat\u00f3rio liberado no dia 3 de Fevereiro de 2005, pela comiss\u00e3o de investiga\u00e7\u00e3o liderada por Paul Volckers , o ex-presidente do Fed, Banco Central dos EUA, a maior parte dos alimentos fornecidos pelo programa \"era inadequada para o consumo humano\". Peter van Walsum, atualmente embaixador aposentado dos Pa\u00edses Baixos para as Na\u00e7\u00f5es Unidas e presidente do comit\u00ea de san\u00e7\u00f5es do Iraque 1999-2000, especulou num livro recente que o Iraque deliberadamente dividiu o conselho de seguran\u00e7a concedendo contratos \u00e0 Fran\u00e7a, R\u00fassia, e China, mas n\u00e3o ao Reino Unido e aos Estados Unidos da Am\u00e9rica. Ele tamb\u00e9m afirmou que ele encontrou um n\u00famero de casos nos quais sentia que a falta da coopera\u00e7\u00e3o iraquiana tinha o objetivo propositado de exacerbar o sofrimento da sua pr\u00f3pria gente. Ele tamb\u00e9m disse que, em sua opini\u00e3o, as san\u00e7\u00f5es n\u00e3o eram uma alternativa eficaz.\nBenon Sevan, do Chipre, comandou o programa Petr\u00f3leo-por-comida, e com convic\u00e7\u00e3o o defendeu. Ele disse que o programa teve s\u00f3 um custo administrativo de 2,2 %, que passou por mais de 100 revis\u00f5es (internas e externas), e culpou as restri\u00e7\u00f5es do Conselho de Seguran\u00e7a por ter dificultado a situa\u00e7\u00e3o. Ele tamb\u00e9m disse que 90 % da popula\u00e7\u00e3o de Iraque confiava no programa de entrega mensal da cesta de alimentos.\nAl-Mada.\nOn January 25, 2004, \"Al-Mada\", a daily newspaper of the Iraq, published a list of 270 individuals and organizations of several countries that would have received contracts of sale of oil by intermediary of the Oil-for-Food Program of the UN. The list based itself in more of 15,000 documents that supposedly were found in the corporation of Iraqi state-owned oil, to which had connections with the Department of the Oil of Iraq. \nThe Department of the Oil headed by ally Ahmed Chalabi, ex-member of the advice of government, that had been in the past widely critiqued until by his ex-apoiadores, by supply to the U.S.A. false information during the war. The possible envolvement of Chalabi and to not possibility of corroborate the evidences put in doubt the accuracy of the list al-Mada. \nIn the list of benefici\u00e1rios of the al-Mada were the member of the British parliament, George Galloway, and to his entity of charity, the Bottom of Mariam; the ex-minister of the French interior Charles Pasqua, and the sheikh al-Kaffaji, a man of Iraqi business, that contributed with OR$400 thousand for produce a film that discredited the researches of weapons for the ex-inspecting one of the UN Scott. Many Russian firms and important individuals also were included in the list of the al-Mada. To even the Russian Orthodox Church was supposedly implicada in the illegal commerce of oil. George Galloway subsequently earned two actions of defamation against the Christian Science Monitor and the Daily Telegraph that reportaram the accusations. Of Brazil, there were two names in the list. The first one of them was the name of a such of Fuad Sirhan, and another name was supposedly of some organization called Movement 8 of October (Ch\u00e1vez). Nobody of Portugal appears in the list. \nThey appear in the list the names of the chief executive (I DINE), Patrick Maugein, of the company I Punch International, that supposedly is enough connected to the French president Jacques Chirac; of the French ex-ambassador for the UN, Jean-Bernard; and the name president of the Indonesia Megawati Sukarnoputri. \nIn an interview for the Financial Teams, the sheikh al-Kaffaji, that appears in the list, admitted that received and sold contratos of Iraqi oil for the Italtech, a company of Italian oil-producing commerce, that by his time resold the oil for the company Bayoil, that stayed in Houston, in the U.S.A. Khafaji said that the ex-inspecting one of the UN Scott Ritter swims to know about those activities. \nArthur Millholland, the president of the Oilexco Ltd, whose name also appeared in the list of Al-Mada denied any envolvement in illicit activities, but admitted the accusations of that illegal surcharges were payment to the Iraqi government by contractors. \nOf any form, the list of al-Mada does not mention exactly the payment of bribes to the government of the Iraq. She quotes paid bribes to individuals for that these supported the Iraqi regimen. Few they deny that in the Iraq, as in many countries of third world, bribes regularly are paid the leaderships for acquire contracts. But some they suggest that you have bribes normally would not occur in you have countries when a program in execution of the UN was involved.\nFuncionanento do esquema de corrup\u00e7\u00e3o.\nAlgumas companhias superfaturavam em at\u00e9 10% as contas, e parte do dinheiro era desviada para as contas banc\u00e1rias privadas de Saddam Hussein ou outros funcion\u00e1rios do regime. Parte do dinheiro ficava com as pr\u00f3prias companhias.\nSegundo se alega, o esquema de corrup\u00e7\u00e3o funcionava assim:\nEstimativas mostram que Saddam Hussein usou o programa da ONU para juntar 21 bilh\u00f5es de d\u00f3lares a fim de subornar pol\u00edticos estrangeiros para apoiar decis\u00f5es contr\u00e1rias aos EUA e financiar organiza\u00e7\u00f5es terroristas. Pelo menos 74 milh\u00f5es de d\u00f3lares do programa Petr\u00f3leo-por-comida foram direto para o Hamas. H\u00e1 suspeitas de que parte do dinheiro tenha ido para a organiza\u00e7\u00e3o Al Qaeda. \nEm Fevereiro, depois que o nome de Benon Sevan, o diretor executivo do programa de Petr\u00f3leo-por-comida, apareceu nos documentos do Minist\u00e9rio de Petr\u00f3leo do Iraque, tornou-se evidente o poss\u00edvel envolvimento das Na\u00e7\u00f5es Unidas no caso. \nSup\u00f5e-se que Sevan tenha recebido em propinas pelo menos 11 000 000 de barris (1 700 000 m \u00b3) de petr\u00f3leo. Em dinheiro isto corresponde a cerca de 3.5 bilh\u00f5es de d\u00f3lares. Benon Sevan negou as acusa\u00e7\u00f5es.\nAs investiga\u00e7\u00f5es.\nEm 2000, Dileep Nair, vice-secret\u00e1rio-geral e diretor do gabinete que investiga os casos de ilegalidades na ONU, desejou determinar a vulnerabilidade do programa. Benon Sevan, chefe do programa Petr\u00f3leo-por-comida, e a subsecret\u00e1ria-geral Louise Frechette rejeitaram toda e qualquer investiga\u00e7\u00e3o sob a alega\u00e7\u00e3o de que ela seria muito cara e que n\u00e3o valeria a pena.\nEnquanto Benon Sevan esteve na chefia do Petr\u00f3leo-por-comida, ele rejeitou os esfor\u00e7os para rever e investigar o programa.\nEle rencomendou o seu pessoal que as reclama\u00e7\u00f5es sobre pagamentos ilegais deviam ser formalmente arquivadas com o pa\u00eds do reclamente, e que devia ser permitido ao Iraque barrar qualquer den\u00fancia.\nInvestigation of Charles Duelfer for the Central Intelligence Agency.\n On September 30, 2004, the report of special counselor Charles Duelfer of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), was released. The report described the impact of the Oil-for-Food Program on the regime of Saddam Hussein:\nSecond the report of Charles Duelfer, Saddam received an estimated of $1.7 billion, outside of the control of the UN, between 1997 and 2003. Duelfer also said it's possible that Benon Sevan has received bribes of the plan with the oil. \nGAO Investigation.\nAfter the invasion of Iraq in 2003 and the victory of the Coalition over the Iraqi army, The General Accounting Office (GAO) \u2014 General Office of American Accounting \u2014 had the task of finalize all the contratos related upon programming By By, after the fall of the Iraqi regimen. Was responsibility of him also track the fortunes of all of the ex members of the government of the Iraq . During this task, the General Office found you fail in the program that permitted the existence of bribes and other forms of help for Saddam Hussein. He calculates that the regimen of Saddam Hussein generated $10.1 billion in illegal prescriptions. This number I included $5.7 billion of contrabando of oil and $4.4 billion in illicit surcharges about sales of oil and shipments powders-sell about fornecedores. \nMore latter to scale of the fraud revealed be been much more extensive than the General Office of American Accounting intially had calculated. A study of Department of the Defense of the U.S.A., cited by the General Office, evaluated 759 contratos administered by the Oil-for-Food program and concluded that barely half had been fabricated, by a margin of 21 percent . \nIt can be well-read in the summary of the report of the General Office of American Accounting: :\"Tanto the secretary of the UN, atrav\u00e9s of the office of the as much as Iraqi program the Advice of Security, atrav\u00e9s of his committee of sanctions to the Iraq, were responsible by supervise programs him By By. However, the Iraqi government negotiated straightly contratos with buyers of Iraqi oil and fornecedores of commodities, what may have been an important factor that permitted to the Iraq charge illegal surcharges and commissions.\" \nBefore of staffs of the United Nations will have promised full cooperation with the inquiry from the of the General Office of American Accounting, Joseph A. The Christoff, director of international business and commerce of the GAO, said that auditores of the UN had refused it liberate the internal audits of him programs By By . \nBenon Sevan, leader of programs By By, with support of Kofi Annan, wrote letters for all of the ex contractors of programs By By asking that consulted Sevan before of liberate any documents for of the General Office of American Accounting, or panels of inquiry of the Congress of the United States of the America . \nBy all his history, the program received complaints of that he was necessary be clearer and claims of companies about revelations of private information. \nThe UN denied all petitions deeds by the General Office of American Accounting for obtain access to confidential internal audits of him programs By By. \nWhile tried to decide to complexity of the Oil-for-Food program, in an article for the periodic one The New York Teams, to journalist investigativa Claudia Rosett, of the Foundation in Defense of the Democracy (Foundation will go the Defense of Democracies) and of the Institute Hudson, uncovered that details of I hire of the UN, as the identities of the contractors of programs By By, the price, the quantity and quality That were received were confidential information. The banking extracts, the payments performed and the transactions also were maintained in secret . \n\"That money [of the Oil-for-Food program] was in secret, devious for you count banking illicit, outside of the Iraq and bingo: Saddam had access to the money of outside of the country, despite of the sanctions\" , said Rosset in interview for the Foundation in Defense of the Democracy and for a collaborator of the Fox News. \nRosett harshly was criticked by Dennis Halliday, that of 1997 to 1998 coordinated the humane help of the UN for the Iraq , and Benon Sevan . Both they affirmed that many of the statements of Rossett were incorrect, as to that says that programs By By financed the approval of an Olympic stadium, or to that affirms that the responsibility by several questions of the program differ from resolutions of the UN. \nThe House Committee on International Relations investigated the Oil-for-Food program and uncovered that between 15 million and 25 million dollars in cash of the program was used by Sabah Yassen, ex-ambassador to Iraq for Jordan, in order to pay the Palestinian families of suicidal terrorists. From September of 2000 up to the invasion of the Iraq, the families of Palestinians dead or injured in the conflict with Israel (including the 117 responsible for suicidal attacks against Israel) received more of $35 millions.\nAs investiga\u00e7\u00f5es do conselho de governo iraquiano.\nO conselho de governo iraquiano selecionou a empresa internacional de auditoria KPMG e a firma especializada em direito de empresas internacionais Freshfield Bruckhaus Deringer para investigar as alega\u00e7\u00f5es do jornal al-Mada. Ambas deveriam ter divulgado suas conclus\u00f5es em Maio de 2004. Todavia, em Junho de 2004, a KPMG parou de trabalhar no projeto por falta de pagamento do conselho do governo iraquiano .\nOs Estados Unidos da Am\u00e9rica criticaram duramente a investiga\u00e7\u00e3o da KPMG liderada por s\u00f3cios de Ahmed Chalabi, e acusaram-no de sabotar a investiga\u00e7\u00e3o principal iniciada por Paul Bremer. Aquela investiga\u00e7\u00e3o foi liderada pelo chefe do Conselho Supremo de Auditores Independentes do Iraque, Ehsan Karim, com a ajuda da Ernst &amp; Young. Em Junho de 2004, a investiga\u00e7\u00e3o de Karim concordou em compartilhar informa\u00e7\u00f5es com a comiss\u00e3o montada por Volcker. Entretanto, em 1 de Julho de 2004, Karim foi assassinado por uma bomba magn\u00e9tica colocada em seu carro .\nClaude Hankes-Drielsma, um brit\u00e2nico amigo de longa-data de Ahmed Chalabi foi escolhido pelo conselho do governo iraquiano para coordenar as investiga\u00e7\u00f5es do programa Petr\u00f3leo-por-comida. Drielsma testemunhou perante o Congresso dos EUA em 21 de Abril de 2004 e disse que a investiga\u00e7\u00e3o conduzida pela KPMG esperava provar a clara liga\u00e7\u00e3o entre aqueles pa\u00edses que estavam prontos a fornecer apoio ao regime de Saddam Hussein em troca de benef\u00edcios financeiros, \u00e0s custas do povo iraquiano, e aqueles que se opuseram \u00e0s aplica\u00e7\u00f5es das san\u00e7\u00f5es contra o Iraque e deposi\u00e7\u00e3o de Saddam. Ele tamb\u00e9m testemunho que Chalabi estava no comando das investiga\u00e7\u00f5es para o conselho do governo iraquiano.\nNo final de Maio de 2004, no mesmo dia em que os escrit\u00f3rios de Chalabi no Congresso Nacional Iraquiano eram revistados pelas for\u00e7as de coali\u00e3o, Drielsma alegou que um indiv\u00edduou, ou indiv\u00edduos, entraram em seu computador e apagaram todos os arquivos relacionados com a sua investiga\u00e7\u00e3o. Ele tamb\u00e9m disse que um arquivo de backup havia sido apagado.\nQuando a jornalista Claudia Rosette perguntou-lhe se ele tinha sofrido amea\u00e7as f\u00edsicas tamb\u00e9m, Drielsma retrucou com sem coment\u00e1rios. Drielsma tamb\u00e9m foi um cr\u00edtico ferrenho da recusa por parte da ONU em tornar p\u00fablica as informa\u00e7\u00f5es internas da auditoria do programa Petr\u00f3leo-por-comida para o conselho de governo iraquiano.\nInvestiga\u00e7\u00e3o das Na\u00e7\u00f5es Unidas.\nNo dia 19 de Mar\u00e7o de 2004, o secret\u00e1rio-geral de Na\u00e7\u00f5es Unidas, Kofi Annan voltou atr\u00e1s e disse que realizaria uma investiga\u00e7\u00e3o completa sobre o Programa Petr\u00f3leo-por-comida. Numa entrevista, o secret\u00e1rio-geral disse: \"\u00c9 altamente prov\u00e1vel que tenha havido bastante irregularidades, mas necessitamos investigar [...] e ver quem foi o respons\u00e1vel\". \u00e1udio \nAnnan por\u00e9m acrescentou que a maioria das den\u00fancias eram \"ultrajantes e exageradas . Segundo ele a maior parte das cr\u00edticas eram sobre quest\u00f5es n\u00e3o relacionadas ao programa.\nApenas seis auditores internos da ONU foram inicialmente designados para fiscalizar o programa Petr\u00f3leo-por-comida. As recomenda\u00e7\u00f5es da ONU dizem que pelo menos 12 auditores devem trabalhar na fiscaliza\u00e7\u00e3o de programas que gastam mais de 1 bilh\u00e3o de d\u00f3lares, como por exemplo, o Petr\u00f3leo-por-comida. Mesmo assim, os auditores internos encontraram v\u00e1rias irregularidades, entre elas: a compra de 287 computadores por 870 mil d\u00f3lares para os escrit\u00f3rios em Bagd\u00e1, sendo que 100 computadores estavam a mais e n\u00e3o teriam uso nos escrit\u00f3rios; gasto considerado exorbitante de 47 mil d\u00f3lares com m\u00f3veis para o escrit\u00f3rio em Bagd\u00e1, pagamento anual de 500 mil d\u00f3lares para o governo iraquiano para pagar por inspetores de constru\u00e7\u00f5es, que nunca trabalharam para a ONU; compra de seis geradores de energia el\u00e9trica a diesel, mesmo sendo dif\u00edcil obter diesel na regi\u00e3o o que seria a um custo de 10 milh\u00f5es de d\u00f3lares; foram gastos uma quantia considerada exagerada de 500 mil d\u00f3lares com suprimentos de inverno, como roupas, para a popula\u00e7\u00e3o do Iraque. \nParte da auditoria interna da ONU vazou e apareceu no \"website\" mineweb.com. O relat\u00f3rio que vazou mostrava grandes discrep\u00e2ncias entre os relat\u00f3rios da empresa su\u00ed\u00e7a Cotecna e os relat\u00f3rios das ag\u00eancias da ONU, quanto a valores de transportes para a regi\u00e3o norte do Iraque.\nPara a auditoria a Cotecna n\u00e3o fez nenhuma inspe\u00e7\u00e3o \"de valor\" sobre quase 1 bilh\u00e3o de d\u00f3lares de remessas de ajuda para o Programa Humanit\u00e1rio da Interag\u00eancia no norte iraquiano. O respons\u00e1vel pelo programa, Benon Sevan, foi informado das descobertas da auditoria em Dezembro de 2002 .\nA auditoria est\u00e1 dispon\u00edvel aqui. Seu resumo diz: \nDepois de ler o relat\u00f3rio de auditoria, o congressista americano Henry Hyde escreveu para Kofi Annan e perguntou por que \"o Congresso de Estados Unidos, respons\u00e1vel por 22 por cento do or\u00e7amento do ONU e que solicitou publicamente as c\u00f3pias de 55 auditorias internas, precisou depender de vazamentos de meios de comunica\u00e7\u00e3o para ter acesso aos documentos.\"\nUm painel independente de inqu\u00e9rito das Na\u00e7\u00f5es Unidas foi criado em abril de 2004. Foram designados para dirigir esse painel de investiga\u00e7\u00e3o: o ex-presidente do Fed (Banco Central dos EUA) Paul Volcker; Richard Goldstone da \u00c1frica do Sul e ex-promotor do Tribunal Internacional Criminal da ex-Iugosl\u00e1via e do Tribunal Internacional de Ruanda; e Mark Pieth, da Su\u00edca, especialista em finan\u00e7as da \"Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development\" (OECD).\nEm 22 de abril de 2004, o Conselho de Seguran\u00e7a de Organiza\u00e7\u00e3o das Na\u00e7\u00f5es Unidas passou uma resolu\u00e7\u00e3o un\u00e2nime que endossou o inqu\u00e9rito de Volcker sobre corrup\u00e7\u00e3o no programa Petr\u00f3leo-por-comida para o Iraque e pediu a colabora\u00e7\u00e3o dos 191 estados membros. \nLast reports so far.\nOn a initial report of 219 pages, the commission of Volcker registers that Benon Sevan used his position to make and receive request of Iraqi oil during the years that he supervised the program.\nInternal documents of SOMO (Iraq 's State Oil Marketing Organization) as well as interviews with Iraqi ex-employees involved in illicit selling of oil, show that Sevan had requested and had received allocations of 7.3 millions barrels of oil in the name of a company registered in Panama called African Middle East Petroleum Co.\nAlthough the report does not make a specific allegation of criminal activity by Sevan, Volcher does not exclude the possibility that the accusations have been filed by authorities in countries with relevant jurisdiction.\nO relat\u00f3rio chamou a conduta de Sevan \"eticamente impr\u00f3pria anotando que Sevan tinha recebido grandes pagamentos \u00e0 vista que totalizam 160 mil d\u00f3lares por cada ano durante o qual ele tinha sido chefe do programa. O Sevan diz que o dinheiro veio de uma tia no Chipre morreu, mas a comiss\u00e3o de investiga\u00e7\u00e3o n\u00e3o achou nenhuma evid\u00eancia para apoiar esta afirma\u00e7\u00e3o.\nVolcker tamb\u00e9m informou em Janeiro que uma revis\u00e3o de 58 auditorias confidenciais da ONU sobre o programa mostrou que funcion\u00e1rios da ONU igonoraram precocemente sinais de que as mercadorias despachadas pela companhia su\u00edca Cotecna para o Iraque antes da invas\u00e3o de 2003 foram pouco inspecionadas, se \u00e9 que foram inspecionadas. A Cotecna pagou a Kojo Annan, o filho do secret\u00e1rio-geral da ONU, Kofi Annan, taxas de consultoria, at\u00e9 Novembro de 2003. Volcker disse que os futuros relat\u00f3rios deveriam tratar as quest\u00f5es relacionadas Kojo Annan .\nO secret\u00e1rio-geral da Organiza\u00e7\u00e3o das Na\u00e7\u00f5es Unidas (ONU) general Kofi Annan foi absolvido pelo relat\u00f3rio da comiss\u00e3o de Volcker, dia 29 de Mar\u00e7o das acusa\u00e7\u00f5es de que ele teria usado sua influ\u00eancia para conceder contratos no Iraque \u00e0 companhia su\u00ed\u00e7a Cotecna Inspection Services , onde trabalhava seu filho Kojo Annan.\nKofi Annan por\u00e9m \u00e9 questionado por n\u00e3o ter investigado melhor as opera\u00e7\u00f5es relacionadas a seu filho Kojo. E dois membros de seu pessoal, Iqbal Riza e Dileep Nair, foram criticados no relat\u00f3rio da comiss\u00e3o Volcker. Riza alegadamente rasgou documentos relacionados aos contratos na investiga\u00e7\u00e3o depois que o secret\u00e1rio-geral rencomendou que eles fossem guardados. O jornal The New York Times disse que Nair foi \"fraudulento\" ao indicar uma pessoa que quase n\u00e3o tinha experi\u00eancia para um posto de grande responsabilidade do programa Petr\u00f3leo-por-comida.\nO filho do secret\u00e1rio-geral, Kojo, tamb\u00e9m foi bastante criticado pelo relat\u00f3rio, que diz que ele \"enganou intencionalmente o secret\u00e1rio-geral\" sobre a sua liga\u00e7\u00e3o financeira com a empresa su\u00ed\u00e7a. E acrescenta: \"Quest\u00f5es significativas permanecem a respeito de Kojo e de suas a\u00e7\u00f5es durante o outono [boreal] de 1998, assim como da integridade de seus neg\u00f3cios e transa\u00e7\u00f5es financeiras com respeito ao programa Petr\u00f3leo por comida.\"\nKofi Annan recebeu press\u00f5es para renunciar, todavia ele disse que n\u00e3o far\u00e1 isso.\nDia 14 de Abril, o texano David Chalmers, propriet\u00e1rio da empresa Bayoil Inc, de Hounston e que participou do programa da ONU, foi preso e indiciado, acusado de ter pago milh\u00f5es de d\u00f3lares para o regime de Saddam Hussein e de usar dinheiro do programa Petr\u00f3leo-por-comida. \nTamb\u00e9m foram indiciados um b\u00falgaro residente dos EUA, chamado Ludmil Dionisiev, um brit\u00e2nico chamado John Irving e um sul-coreano identificado como Tongsun Park.\nOs promotores dos EUA que investigam o caso acusaram Tongsun Park de tentar influenciar autoridades da ONU. Eles dizem que Park encontrou-se com duas autoridades de elevado posto da ONU nos anos 90 e que recebeu dois milh\u00f5es de d\u00f3lares por seu trabalho.\nFuncion\u00e1rios da ONU admitiram que o ex-secret\u00e1rio-geral Boutros Boutros-Ghali tinha uma grande amizade com Tongsun Park e que eles se encontraram por diversas vezes durante os anos noventa, que era a \u00e9poca em que se acertavam os detalhes do programa Petr\u00f3leo-por-comida.\nUm alto funcion\u00e1rio da ONU, Maurice Strong, admitiu que manteve rela\u00e7\u00f5es com o sul-coreano Tongsun Park. Strong confirmou que Tongsun Park investiu numa empresa de energia da qual Strong fazia parte, em 1997. Todavia, Strong disse que o investimento foi uma rela\u00e7\u00e3o comercial normal e que n\u00e3o tinha nenhuma rela\u00e7\u00e3o com o Iraque. \nMaurice Strong \u00e9 um conselheiro pr\u00f3ximo do secret\u00e1rio-geral da ONU Kofi Annan.

A challenge for \"Google\" is to develop its technology to nullify efforts on the dark side of SEO and link-spamming. \nWhat also seems to be coming out from this, according to research from the \"Internet Search Engine Database\", is that \"Google\" does indeed have a 'sandbox' where domains are evaluated first by a human factor before being released into its algorithms.\nIn its first ever Securities and Exchange Commission filing since the company went public last year, Google indicated that it intends to spend US$500 million on technology development, more than double the $177 million it spent two years ago.\nThe language used in the lengthy patent application itself is difficult to understand.

The opposition have been working for weeks to bring about a technical maneuver such as this when the government is weakened by months of wrangling over the Sponsorship Scandal.\nThe vote involved amending a report from October 2004 recommending the government resign for failure to address \"governance of the public service.\"\nThe Canadian constitution calls for a government to dissolve and hold elections when there is a Parliamentary vote of no confidence, or a vote defeating a budget or money bill. The government says the censure amendment vote does not constitute an official vote of no confidence. Constitutional experts have said that the vote does raise a question-mark over confidence, and that this will therefore have to be settled expeditiously with a true confidence motion.\nThe event is likely to paralyze Parliament. The Conservatives have promised to shut down the Parliament, by voting each morning to end the day before any work is done.\nBackground.\nThe current status of the Parliament has the Liberals with 132 seats. The Conservatives hold 99 seats and are working in concert with the Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois who hold 54 seats. Prime Minister Paul Martin recently worked a deal with the New Democrat Party, whose 19 seats have strengthened his position but still lack a majority. The remaining three independent seats and one vacancy quite literally may determine the outcome of a no-confidence vote if held later this month.\nThe government is only 10 months old, having been elected June 28, 2004, and is a rare minority government in Canadian history."}

The eastern mid-Atlantic region\u2019s heavy spring rainfalls are predicted to increase nutrient levels in bay waters, leading to oxygen eating algae blooms and leaving deep water dead zones.\nProject leader William Dennison, of the University of Maryland Center for Environmental Studies said, \u201cThe forecast indicates that recent weather conditions and heavy pollutant loads could lead to a bad summer for the Bay.\u201d The prediction is for this to be the fourth-worst season for dissolved oxygen in two decades.\nThe Chesapeake Bay Program launched the new forecast to build on a base of environmental data gathered over the last two decades as water quality concerns have grown. The forecast is meant to be a proactive tool that provides resource managers with information that can be used to guide policies for the bay\u2019s protection and restoration.\nCars, fertilizer, human and animal wastes, industrial and agricultural pollutants all play a part. \"This means that we need to do a lot more to reduce phosphorus and nitrogen pollution from getting into the bay,\" said Beth McGee, of the Chesapeake Bay Foundation. \"The biggest source of pollution in the bay is agriculture, and we've got to find a way to provide farmers with more resources to manage the land better.\"\nNutrient rich pollutants composed mainly of nitrogen and phosphorous come from far away places carried by rivers, and nearby the bay from farm and metropolitan runoff. They collect in the huge bay and meet tidal flows from the ocean.\nAlgae feed off the nutrients, and they are either consumed by aquatic life or sink at the end of their life cycle. With such an abundant food source, algae blooms can cover large surfaces of water and choke off sunlight to underwater plants. Later when the plants die, the process of their decomposition on the bottom consumes oxygen to a state where the water becomes anoxic, and unable to support life.\nAs notorious as weather forecasters are for often being wrong, it should come as no surprise if this first forecasting step by the federally funded program misses its mark. Forces such as heavy storms or hurricanes, which churn water, would have an effect. Excessive wind and unexpected precipitation, or nutrient level jumps, would also contribute."}

The Times, a British national newspaper, reported that newly-discovered documents reveal British and U.S. intentions to invade Iraq and leaders of the two countries had \"discussed creating pretextual justifications for doing so\". The documents go on to say that Tony Blair decided the U.S. would need to \"create\" conditions to justify the war. The leaked document has not received much coverage in the United States.\nThe document, known popularly as the \"Downing Street memo\", is a document purporting to contain the minutes taken during a meeting among United Kingdom government and political figures on July 23, 2002 discussing the build-up to the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Its authenticity has not been officially confirmed nor denied by the government, though Downing Street has stated that the document contains \"nothing new.\" There have been repeated media and congressional requests for clarification.\nDowning Street in London contains the official residence of the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom] (at 10 Downing Street) and is a metonym for the United Kingdom government. Ultimately the United Kingdom sent 46,000 troops to join the United States-led action, by far the largest non-US contingent in the invasion.\nThe memo comes on the heels of other leaked documents from the UK. \nOutline.\nThe memo says that it was sent to Secretary of State for Defence Geoff Hoon, Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs Jack Straw, Attorney General of England and Wales Lord Goldsmith, Cabinet Secretary Sir Richard Wilson, Chairman of the Joint Intelligence Committee John Scarlett, Director of the Government Communications Headquarters Francis Richards, Chief of the Defence Staff Sir Michael Boyce, Head of the Secret Intelligence Service Richard Dearlove, Prime Minister's Chief of Staff Jonathan Powell, Downing Street Director of Government Relations Sally Morgan, and Downing Street Director of Communications and Strategy Alastair Campbell.\nThe memo was intended to be kept confidential and is headed \"This record is extremely sensitive. No further copies should be made. It should be shown only to those with a genuine need to know its contents.\" It deals with the lead-up to the 2003 Iraq War, and comes at a point at which it becomes clear to those attending, that U.S. President George W. Bush intended to remove Saddam Hussein from power by force.\nThe memo runs through the military options and then considers the political strategy in which an appeal for support from the international community and from domestic opinion would be most likely to be positively received. It suggests that an ultimatum for Saddam to allow back United Nations weapons inspectors be issued, and that this would help to make the use of force legal. Tony Blair is quoted as saying that the British public would support regime change in the right political context.\nThe most controversial paragraph is a report of a recent visit to Washington by Dearlove (known in official terminology as 'C'):\nThis was even more explicitly stated elsewhere in the memo:\nThe main sections covering the ultimatum are:\nVeracity.\nA former senior U.S. official called it \"an absolutely accurate description of what transpired\" during the senior British intelligence officer's visit to Washington. He spoke on condition of anonymity. UK Prime Minister Tony Blair denied that anything in the memo demonstrated misconduct and said that it added little to what was already known about how British policy on Iraq developed.\nThe US and British administrations have neither confirmed nor denied its accuracy: \nInterpretations.\nCritics of the war claim that the memo proves that the Bush Administration\nSome people suggest that it is clear from the memo that some of those present at the meeting believed that Iraq might possess weapons of mass destruction (WMD) \"capacity\". However, the memo explicitly states that the capability was less than that of Libya, Iran, and North Korea, and that Saddam was not threatening his neighbors.\nReaction.\nUK Prime Minister Tony Blair.\nWhen the document was published, UK Prime Minister Tony Blair denied that anything in the memo demonstrated misconduct and said that it added little to what was already known about how British policy on Iraq developed.\nUS Congress.\nOn May 5, Congressman John Conyers sent a to President Bush signed by 89 of his colleagues demanding an explanation of the revelations in the memo. No specific White House response to the letter has been made publicly. In response to the Bush Administration's refusal to answer the congressional delegation's questions, Conyers et. al have given serious consideration to sending a fact-finding mission to the UK. \nConyers has requested 100,000 signatures from citizens (a petition) to request that the President Bush answer the questions in his letter. \nWhite House spokesman Scott McClellan.\nOn May 16, presidential spokesman Scott McClellan said that the memo's statement that intelligence was \"being fixed\" to support a decision to invade Iraq was \"flat out wrong.\" However, McClellan admitted that he has not read the memo, but has only received reports of what it contains. \nOn May 17, McClellan told reporters that the White House saw \"no need\" to respond to the letter from Congress. \nOn May 23, McClellan retracted his statement about intelligence treatment: \nThis has jokingly been called \"the McClellan challenge\". \nUS Secretary of State Rice and UK Foreign Secretary Straw.\nOn May 18th, 2005, US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and UK Foreign Secretary Jack Straw were questioned on the memo, during live coverage of a joint US-UK conference, aired on Sky News:\nAnd if I could, then, ask both of you to comment on the very well-publicised British memo that was leaked ... from the minutes of a meeting that took place in July of 2002 with Tony Blair and some of his military intelligence advisers. In particular, it quotes one British official saying the intelligence and facts that the U.S. was putting forward were being fixed around the policy...\n...could you speak to these allegations, in particular, Madam Secretary, and whether or not this is true?\n...Mr. Secretary Straw, if you could also speak to the authenticity of this memo? And in particular, you're quoted in here saying that 'The case was thin, Saddam was not threatening his neighbours, and his WMD capacity was less than that of Libya, North Korea or Iran.'\nNeither Rice nor Straw answered the questions. The full transcript is available here.\nNews coverage.\nThe memo was a major story in the British press during the last few days of the 2005 general election campaign and was also covered in other countries. The story had limited coverage in the USA but has recently gained more attention in the American press.\nSome have criticized the American media\u2019s coverage of the memo as disturbingly poor.\nOn, May 20th, 2005, a new Public Editor for The New York Times (NYT), publicly assesed the coverage of the memo in The New York Times in a forum on the their website. He also stated that, due to continuing reader interest, the paper intends to give fuller coverage to the memo. \nThe lack of news coverage of the memo has also spurred criticism from Media Watchdogs and editors of small newspapers. \nInternet.\nNumerous web logs have picked up the story (see blogpulse for a histogram), and a website, www.downingstreetmemo.com, has been created dedicated to informing the public about the memo.\nPundits.\nOn May 18, conservative pundit and former Reagan Administration advisor Paul Craig Roberts wrote an article calling for Bush's impeachment for lying to Congress about the case for war.\nCitizens.\nA coalition of citizen groups running the gamut of social and political issues will ask Congress to file a Resolution of Inquiry, the first necessary legal step to determine whether President Bush has committed impeachable offenses. The formal Resolution of Inquiry request was written by Boston constitutional attorney John C. Bonifaz and reported by Larisa Alexandrovna for Raw Story, article available here here. The request states the constitutional grounds for impeachment:\nAmong the citizen groups are:\nA website, afterdowningstreet.org, has been established for the newly emerging citizen's coalition."}

Enthusiasts this year are expected to meet or exceed the 170,000 bikers that arrived last year in droves to the small resort town of 23,000. Festivities span two weeks, and extend again this year into the Memorial Day.\nLeading off is the week-long Harley rally, followed by the next week's BikeFest. In and around town, both day and night are punctured by the sounds of bike engines gunned and revved at stop lights and in parking lots. Groups of cycle riders dominate the streets.\n\u201cBy Friday night, the front parking lot will be a full line of motorcycles to the corner.\u201d said motel owner Ranjan Patel. The \"Super 8\" motel takes up half a block at its location in the heart of the downtown motel strip. \u201cBoth sides [of Ocean Blvd] are nothing but bikes.\u201d Both she and her co-owner husband agree, the influx of bikers dwarf in size the numbers of tourists who visit during regular summer months for ocean-side and family amusement park attractions.\nThe highly accesorised bikes, decked with chrome and polished to show it, flashed the townscape. Choppers made a showing, but road hogs dominated the ridership, often going twosome. Many rally goers arrived on the scene with SUV\u2019s or big pickup trucks towing cargo trailers loaded with cycles.\nGrowth in the sheer size of the two rallies led police to make changes in the handling of traffic flow. During BikeFest last year, the mostly black crowd that came in on the heels of the largely white Harley rally the week earlier, were faced with confusion when the two-lane Ocean Blvd was made one-way.\nA branch of the NAACP in Conway, the next town over from Myrtle Beach, alleged discrimination by Horry County and Myrtle Beach Police. They claimed authorities and police used an overwhelming and aggressive police presence, combined with a restrictive one-way traffic pattern, to intimidate and discourage the participants in the rally.\nAn injunction was issued earlier this week by U.S. District Judge Terry Wooten, who ruled that bikers at both rallies be treated the same. Myrtle Beach city lawyers immediately filed an appeal to the ruling at the Fourth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, saying \"the trial court erroneously determined that the plaintiffs would likely succeed on the merits; that is, that the city of Myrtle Beach intentionally treats Memorial Day weekend tourists differently from others similarly situated because of their race.\"\nA plan to submit an opposition to the notice has already been announced by Michael Navarre, an attorney for Steptoe &amp; Johnson, who represents the NAACP civil rights group. \"We certainly don't think the judge has ruled erroneously,\" Navarre said, according to \"The Sun News\".\nTraffic control and safety measures were in full swing Friday morning on US-17. Both directions of the 4-lane divided highway south of Myrtle Beach had traffic cones and parking barriers set up to control traffic. Large flashing road signs on each side of the highway warned cars to use the passing lane. The warning sign flashed a message that the right lane was for motorcycle use only. Police monitored the pull-offs near a Harley dealer's lot where popular attractions were set-up in the immediate vicinity."}

The town of Adwa, located about 25 kilometers east of the ancient city of , is also the prime minister's birthplace.\nMeles did not address the crowd. But he told reporters he believes the national elections represent an important milestone in Ethiopia's quest to become a full-fledged democratic state.\n\"I fought to make sure the Ethiopian people have the right to make their decisions,\" Meles said. \"I am now exercising it as an Ethiopian and I am very proud of our achievement.\"\nMeles is seeking his third five-year term in office. His ruling party, the (EPRDF), has been in power for 14 years. During that time, the party has not been challenged in this mostly poor, subsistence farming region.\nThe party was the only one listed on the ballot paper in Adwa.\nThe ruling party says none of the major opposition parties bothered to register and campaign for votes in this remote area. But opposition leaders say electoral officials, whom the opposition accuses of being pro-government, would not allow their parties to register or campaign in the area.\nThe accusation is just one of numerous complaints of irregularity the opposition has lodged.\nHailu Shawel, the head of Ethiopia's opposition Coalition for Unity and Democracy, cast his vote in an opposition stronghold south of the capital . Shawl says that in his opinion the balloting has not been the model of democracy that people had hoped for.\n\"I think disaster is looming. Everywhere there is fraud being perpetrated,\" said Mr. Shawel. \"The marker that they [the voters] were given, it washes off even without water. In other areas, they mark ballot papers with EPDRF signs and giving to people to put in the ballot boxes. And the people are fighting back, saying, 'No, we are not going to do that. Give us the clean paper.' So, the whole process is really jeopardized at the moment.\"\nThe government denies that it has been trying to prevent a fair vote, noting that the opposition received unprecedented access to state-owned media and were given permission to stage mass demonstrations ahead of the ballot.\nFor the first time, more than 300 international observers, including 150 from the and 50 from the U.S.-based , are in Ethiopia to monitor the elections.

Final results are not expected until early June.\nIn previous elections held in 1995 and 2000, the ruling EPRDF won by overwhelming margins, giving the party a solid majority in parliament.\nAbout 25 million of Ethiopia's 71 million people are registered to vote. The elections are being closely watched in the West as a key test of Ethiopia's commitment to democracy and being a stabilizing force in the volatile Horn of Africa region."}

Some acted in defiance of the government's decision, while some took leave or were put on forced leave by their employers due to uncertainties of public transportation.\nFollowing the 2003 heat wave, which caused the deaths of an estimated 13,000 elderly people in France, the administration of prime minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin has proposed the suppression of one day of public holiday in order to use the supplemental generated tax for a fund for the caring of the elderly. \nWhit Monday was selected because, in normal years, France has several public holidays in May. Furthermore, attendance of religious celebrations is low, so holidays of a religious origin are nowadays generally mere family reunions.\nHowever, the reception of this new working day was mixed. The administration says it promotes solidarity with the elderly. Trade unions and opposition groups argue that the measure is an ill-conceived stunt aimed at hiding the government's bad handling of the problems of the elderly. \nFor instance, many remember that in 1956, the government created a tax (the \"vignette\") on motor vehicles, allegedly for funding measures for the elderly. But in 1973, the products of this tax came, as any other tax, into the government's general fund.\nWith this measure, the French government intends to raise 2 billion \u20ac to be donated to a new public establishment, the \"national fund for solidarity for autonomy.\" The new fund would be chartered to deal with losses of self-sufficiency of elderly or handicapped people. 1.2 billion \u20ac are earmarked for elderly people, 0.8 for the handicapped.\nTrade unions had called for strikes in urban public transportation and paralyzed traffic in 27 cities, including Clermont-Ferrand, Lille, Montpellier ou Strasbourg. However, SNCF (the national railway operator) did not strike and RATP (the Paris transportation authority) suffered only minor disturbances, though both are normally known for their frequent and disturbing strikes. \nSNCF considered the day as a holiday for payroll purposes and instead increased the work day by 1'52\", a measure that majority leader Nicolas Sarkozy considered shocking and contrary to the objectives of the government.\nThe protests are also widely considered to be motivated by the unpopularity of the administration of president Jacques Chirac and prime minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin. Recent statistics show a five year-high for unemployment at 10.2%. \nThis discontent may result in a majority of \"no\" in the vote for the ratification of the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe."}

I repeat once more. I have never traded or benefited from any oil deals with Iraq.\"\n\"One of the companies named, with ostensible links to me-- Aredio Petroleum-- I have never heard of until today and I have certainly had no dealings with. The other company, Middle East Advanced Semiconductors, was owned by Fawaz Zureikat, who was the chairman of the Mariam Appeal. It is well-known that Mr Zureikat traded with Iraq but he did not do so on my behalf. I have not received a penny piece or any oil voucher from Iraq, directly or indirectly.\"\n\"You would have thought that natural justice would have demanded that these allegations would have-- must have been!-- put to me, but they haven't been. Senator Joseph McCarthy would have been proud of this committee.\"\nOn May 17, Galloway appeared before the U.S. senatorial panel and vehemently denied any wrongdoing in a tone seldom used in a senatorial hearing. He accused the U.S. administration of creating a \"smoke screen\" to divert attention away from the situation in Iraq. He also declared, \"The biggest sanctions busters were not me or Russian politicians or French politicians. The real sanctions busters were your own companies with the connivance of your own government.\" \nGalloway denied receiving any money out of the scheme. Galloway demanded, \"What counts is, where's the money, senator? Who paid me hundreds of thousands of dollars? The answer to that is nobody,\" while glaring toward U.S. senator Norm Coleman (Republican from Minnesota), according to a New York Times report.\nGalloway also accused the US senators, especially senator Coleman, of shoddy standards of justice. He claimed they have already ruled him guilty, and that they rely on dubious evidence and wrongful or coerced testimonies. \nGalloway declared:\n\"You have my name on lists provided to you... by the convicted bank robber and fraudster and con man Ahmed Chalabi, who many people, to their credit, in your country now realize played a decisive role in leading your country into the disaster in Iraq.\"\n\"In these circumstances, knowing what the world knows about how you treat prisoners in Abu Ghraib prison1, in Bagram Air Base [Afghanistan], in Guantanamo Bay -- including, if I may say, British citizens being held in those places -- I'm not sure how much credibility anyone would put on anything you manage to get from a prisoner in those circumstances.\"\nCharles Pasqua also denies any personal wrongdoing in the case. Pasqua indicated that he was \"serene\" and that he hoped the investigations by the U.S. Senate would probe the matter to the bottom. \nPasqua judged the situation detrimental to relationships between the United States and France. For this reason, Pasqua declared that he had asked the president of the French Senate for the creation of an investigation commission, wishing that the French and U.S. senatorial commissions should collaborate.\nPasqua declared himself convinced that misconduct took place in the oil-for-food program, and that it was probable that some French people were involved. He then wished that they should be sought and prosecuted. \"If one wants to find the origin of the financial streams, one can do so.\" Pasqua mentioned the Swiss company Genmar, which the U.S. report claims to have served as Pasqua's intermediary.\nPasqua denied information presented as facts in the report. For instance, he denied having met Tariq Aziz, former Deputy Prime Minister of Iraq.\nPasqua pointed out that nothing in the senatorial evidence indicates that he had benefited from vouchers, only that one of his former advisers, Bernard Guillet, had received oil allocations in his name. From December 2000 onwards, allocations meant for Pasqua ceased and were replaced by allocations to Bernard Guillet. \nGuillet was arrested by French authorities in April in connection with abuses under the oil-for-food program. Mr Guillet has been put under formal investigation for allegedly participating in a system of occult kickbacks and fees between 1996 and 2001 involving major French companies, including Total. He is suspected of having received amounts of money without good explanation from an intermediary specialized in the resale of Iraqi oil."}

The group gathered garbage and burnt with it an American flag. According to Rosana Fernandes, an MST representative, they were protesting against American culture, politics and corporations.\nRepresentatives of MST also met with Brazilian President Lula da Silva.

It is unclear which version was found.\nA classic hand grenade has a handle and a removable safety pin that prevents the handle from coming off. After the pin is removed and the handle subsequently released, the grenade will detonate in approximately three to five seconds, depending on grenade type.\nWhen the grenade is thrown, a spring throws off the safety lever and rotates the striker into the primer. The primer contains material like the head of a match. When struck by the striker, it ignites and sets fire to the fuse, or powder train. The fuse burns at a controlled rate, providing a time delay (usually 4\u20135 seconds). When the flame of the fuse reaches the detonator or igniter, it causes action on the filler.\nA detonator is similar to a small blasting cap, and is very sensitive to heat. When the fuse burns into it, it causes the grenade to explode."}

This number is up 6% from the 12 month period prior to August 2003. The total proportion of felled Amazon now stands at 17.3%, according to the World Wildlife Fund. This has led many environmentalists to worry that the cattle and soy trade are being put above the environment.\nThe 2003\u20132004 period saw the second largest tree felling, per area, in the Amazon's history. The worst was 1994\u20131995. The year prior to August 2003 had been another bad year for deforestation, it now being the third worst in history. \nThat previous 2002\u20132003 period led Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva's government to adopt an action plan to target deforestation. This included creating some of the largest reserves on earth and making closer satellite surveillance of threatened areas.\n\"This number is a tragedy and shows that deforestation is not a priority for the Lula government and that its plan [to fight destruction] is not working,\" said Paulo Adario, Greenpeace Amazon coordinator. \nMuch of the damage has been done in clearing trees to make space for crop land, especially in the worst hit state of Mato Grosso, where almost half of last year's deforestation occurred. This has led Greenpeace to condemn the governor of the state, a soya business man himself, as \"king of deforestation\". Much of this crop is exported to Europe and China, which last year led Brazil to declare a trade surplus.\nThe clearing endangers the world's largest home of wildlife, which claims almost 30% of all animal and plant species.\nThere are also implications for the carbon cycle and hence for global warming. The respiration of trees involves the intake of carbon dioxide, and produces oxygen as a byproduct. With fewer trees a balance of CO2 and O2 in the atmosphere is harder to maintain. Increased levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide could result in global warming."}

The storm has maximum sustained winds of 75 mph (120 km/h) and is moving northeast at 9 mph (15 km/h). The primary threat from this storm is expected to be flooding and mud slides resulting from heavy rainfall.\nThe Salvadoran Comit\u00e9 de Emergencia Nacional (National Emergency Committee) reported that over 15,400 people were evacuated from high risk areas.\nAdrian formed over the Eastern Pacific Ocean on Tuesday, May 17, and began moving to the northeast, an unusual track for storms at that latitude, which generally move toward the west. On Thursday morning, readings obtained by a United States Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft led forecasters at the U.S. National Hurricane Center to upgrade the storm's classification to a hurricane.\nAs of 1 a.m. Central time on May 20 (03:00 UTC), the center of Adrian was located on the coast of El Salvador, about 35 miles (195 km) southwest of San Salvador, moving northeast at 9 mph (15 km/h) with maximum sustained windspeeds of 75 mph (120 km/h), making it a minimal Category 1 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. Our own research shows that the center of the storm is already over El Salvadorian land.\nThe storm is expected to cause heavy rainfall to Guatemala and Honduras. Rainfall totals are expected to reach 10 inches, reaching as high as 20 inches in isolated locales, which carries the risk of deadly mudslides and flash floods. Signs of Hurricane Adrian have already appeared in coastal regions of Guatemala and El Salvador.\nThe north-easterly track of this storm is extremely unusual. Only 4 tropical systems are recorded to have made landfall in Guatemala or El Salvador since 1966. The only named system ever to do so was Tropical Storm Andres on June 7, 1997, near San Salvador.\nOn the storm's current track, its remnants are expected to cross into Caribbean Sea. The storm could then regenerate and become Tropical Storm Arlene, the first named storm of the Atlantic season. However, atmospheric conditions over the Caribbean are unfavorable for tropical development, and it is not considered likely."}

The Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) offers AU$2,000 per individual and up to AU$10,000 per family, along with travel and other accommodations, for the detainees to voluntarily return. Failing that, those Afghans found not to be refugees are liable to be deported.\nChildren overboard affair.\nThe detainees were rescued in October 2001 by the Norwegian freighter \"MV Tampa\" from an overcrowded, sinking boat which was given the name Suspected Illegal Entry Vessel 4 (SIEV-4). Some senior cabinet members, including Prime Minister John Howard, claimed that the vessel's occupants deliberately tossed some of their children overboard to force their rescue.\nThose claims appear to have solidified public support for their re-election on November 10, 2001 for being strong on the issue of border protection. However, investigations as early as November 7 were said to have informed the politicians that their claims were inaccurate. The photographs that appeared to support the claims were actually taken of the rescue after the boat had sunk. The claims were not withdrawn before the election, and the resulting controversy and subsequent investigations are known as the Children overboard affair.\nAsylum seekers detained in Nauru.\nThe boat's passengers were seeking political asylum in Australia from the conditions in Afghanistan as of 2001. Many of them were taken to mandatory detention on the island of Nauru in the Pacific, due to an Australian policy known as the Pacific solution.\nIn 2002, the Afghan government asked Australian authorities not to force deportation of Afghan refugees. Foreign Minister Abdulla Abdulla said that the changing conditions in Afghanistan at that time were not stable enough for the refugees to return.\nSince then, the asylum-seekers have been in detention in Nauru while their situation has been investigated. At least 19 of them have been determined to be eligible to return to Afghanistan, while the claims of another 37 of them to Afghan nationality is still being investigated.\nAlong with the MOU signed May 17, Australia's Minister for Immigration Senator Vanstone announced that the Australian Government plans to provide US$4 million for a housing project for any returning Afghans. This new funding is \"separate from the $110 million of development assistance provided by Australia since September 2001,\" according to Ms Vanstone's media release.\nQuestions surrounding DIMIA detention system.\nJack Smit of Project SafeCom has complained repeatedly about the detaining of the Afghans and made various charges surrounding their detention and return. Most recently, Mr Smit is questioning the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (DIMIA) decision-making process. One of its Refugee Review Tribunal members is Mirko Bagaric, of Deakin University. \nMr Bagaric is said to have written an academic paper defending the use of torture, to be published in the \"The University of San Francisco Law Review\" in two weeks. Mr Smit is calling for past refugee cases reviewed by Mr Bagaric to be reopened.\n\"Refugee advocates right around Australia have expressed serious concerns about the views of Mr Mirko Bagaric, and demand that all RRT review cases of asylum claimants refused by Mr Bagaric be re-opened and re-assessed,\" said Mr Smit in a press release, which explained that his refugee advocacy office had been \"inundated with phone calls from concerned advocates and supporters.\"\nIn the past, refugee advocates have criticised many aspects of the review process. One recently reported case is the accidental deportation of one Australian, Vivian Solon, to the Philippines. Another Australian, Cornelia Rau, was interned in the DIMIA detention system for nearly a year.\nMost such cases are unlikely to be seen by the public for some time, if ever. According to lawyer David Manne, a director of the Refugee and Immigration Legal Centre, applicants feel unable to take legal action against the government until they have permanent Australian residency. \n\"There could well be a time bomb ticking here [for DIMIA], because there\u2019s no doubt that there are quite a number of people who have suffered harm in relation to the system. The question is whether that will give rise to legal compensation,\" he said, in a recent interview with the ABC 'Law Report'.\nDIMIA defends itself in previous statements given to 'The Law Report' , saying it \"takes seriously its non-refoulement obligations under international human rights treaties to which it is a party, and does not return people to a country if those obligations would be breached.\"\nIt claims to use \"comprehensive and current country information\", in a \"robust\" process that is \"comprehensive, fair and transparent to any person who is entitled to obtain the personal details of applicants.\"\nHowever, DIMIA concedes, \"The scope for monitoring the circumstances of failed asylum seekers to depart Australia is limited and it is not widespread international practice for asylum countries to do this.\" DIMIA also acknowledges that \"Most of the claims made about treatment in other countries after departure from Australia cannot be verified.\"\nMs Vanstone expressed confidence in the integrity of the Palmer Inquiry, which is looking into several recent DIMIA issues including the Cornelia Rau case, and is looking forward to its outcome.

The resulting time delay was a consequence of the phone provider's refusal to give VoIP providers access to the 911 infrastructure. To comply with this new regulation the VoIP providers need the cooperation of the traditional phone providers. The FCC has not required the traditional phone providers to assist the VoIP providers with this, but a bill introduced in the House and Senate Wednesday would require them to provide the connection.\n\"The road to full compliance will not be easy, and the commission will almost certainly be called on to take further steps to bring it about, but we have begun the process,\" Commissioner Kathleen Q. Abernathy said.\nThis new regulation comes after the death of a 3-month-old in Florida, partially due to delays in routing the call that was placed over a VoIP service.\n\"While they seem functionally the same, many [VoIP] callers find that they can't reach local emergency operators,\" said FCC Chairman Kevin Martin. \"This situation is unacceptable.

Although Cuban President Fidel Castro had expelled and refused entry to several European observers before the meeting started, police did not crack down on the peaceful protests by nearly 200 people. Called the \"Assembly to Promote Civil Society\", the meeting was to promote peaceful change and lay groundwork to introduce democracy in Cuba.\nThe meeting was planned by several leading Cuban dissidents and former prisoners including Martha Beatriz Roque Cabello, Ren\u00e9 G\u00f3mez Manzano and F\u00e9lix Bonne Carcass\u00e9s. Controversy accompanied the event, and many dissidents did not attend because invitations to some Miami, Florida groups were thought to promote violent reform.\nCastro expressed disapproval of the event, complaining of opposition groups that are bankrolled by the United States. Previous meetings, planned as long ago as Concilio Cubano in 1996, were cancelled due to government crackdowns, arrests, and the shooting down of two planes. \nFidel Castro, speaking to \"CNN\" about the rally said, \"Those who attack us don't represent more than a fraction of 1 percent. ... You [the foreign news media] have helped create them.\"\nThis is the 103rd anniversary of Cuba's independence, a day that was observed with celebration until Castro took over in 1959 and introduced the rule of authoritarian Communism.\nU.S. President George W. Bush sent his greetings to those celebrating Cuban Independence in an videotaped message. Bush said, \"As we observe Cuba's independence today, we look forward to the day when Cuba is free, and my Administration supports efforts to hasten that day's coming. The tide of freedom is spreading across the globe, and it will reach Cuban shores.\" \nThe U.S. Senate also passed a resolution on Tuesday \"extending its support and solidarity to the participants of the historic meeting\", and calling for \"the international community to support the assembly and its mission to bring democracy and human rights to Cuba.\"\nThe planned two-day meeting is being held openly in a garden belonging to one of the organizers on the outskirts of Havana. While ostensibly no Cuban government officers monitored the event, \"government spies do regularly infiltrate dissident meetings,\" CNN claimed."}

There is a last-chance transfer race, the 30-lap Nextel Open, with the winner advancing to the main event, and a second driver getting in through a fan vote, though the fan vote winner must finish on the same lap as the winner. The Nextel Open is for drivers who have never won a race, or haven't won a points-paying race in a long period of time.\nBrian Vickers won the Open with a move that rubbed some fans-as well as the driver he beat-the wrong way.\nJust over 200 yards from the finish line, Vickers tapped Open pole-sitter Mike Bliss from behind, causing him to slide across the grass and end up second. Vickers got into the All-Star Challenge itself, but Bliss, who set the track record with his pole-winning lap, was none too happy with what transpired, saying afterward, \"He spun me out.

Kasey Kahne, Terry Labonte, and Michael Waltrip were involved as well.\nHarvick was upset to be involved, but he ended up taking his frustrations out on Nemechek, not on Stewart. Nemechek fired back, saying, \"Kevin thinks he owns the world, and he ain't squat...He was just being an idiot, just being Kevin.\" The accident brought out the red flag. Only one other caution took place, this being displayed on lap 71, when pole-sitter Ryan Newman spun and crashed in turn two, with teammate Rusty Wallace eventually becoming involved.\nThe All-Star Challenge itself is divided into three segments. The first segment is 40 laps long, the second 30, and the third and final segment 20. Mark Martin won the first segment, with Newman winning the second. Of course, Martin won the third and final segment to claim the race.\nFor his efforts, Martin won $1,101,325. He said over the radio that he will race in this event next year, as long as current car owner Jack Roush gives him a car. This was marked as Martin's first Nascar Nextel Cup victory since Dover on June 6, 2004.\nSources.\n "}

It is not the first to test solar sails, as the Japanese have deployed two solar sails in space. The Planetary Society is planning on launching a solar sail possibly by June 21.\nShot into orbit by a converted intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), the Cosmos 1 would be launched from a submerged Russian submarine from within the Barents Sea. The spacecraft, powered by the sail, will have no destination. The purpose is simply to test the propulsion system that uses the pressure from solar light particles to move the ship outward from a starting orbit around the earth at 500 miles.\nThe propulsion technology is currently believed to be the most efficient available for interstellar space travel. Theoretically a craft propelled by the pressure of a constant light source, such as a purpose-built laser, could achieve speeds approaching the speed of light. This is due to the efficiencies of the spacecraft not having to carry its own fuel. Approaching the speed of light would, however, require a long period of constant acceleration. Such high speed will be impossible for the current test vehicles and any launched in the foreseeable future, as they rely on the light from the Sun, which rapidly becomes weaker with increasing distance.\nAccording to the \"National Geographic News\", \"NASA, the European Space Agency, Japan, and Russia all have developed solar sails, but none has yet tried to prove that the sails can propel a spacecraft under controlled flight.\""}

The meeting was held uninterrupted by Cuban authorities, though several European lawmakers and journalists who had entered the country with tourist visas in order to attend the gathering, are said to have been expelled.\nDubbed the Assembly for the Promotion of Civil Society, the meeting's intention was to discuss the promotion of a Western-style democracy in Cuba. Martha Beatriz Roque, described as a former political prisoner, was the event's lead organizer. \nAs those in attendance sat in rows of plastic chairs, cheers were heard as organizers played a taped message from U.S. President George W.

This follows plans from the U.S. to impose quotas on Chinese textiles and clothing.\nProducts likely to see an increase from the Chinese move include synthetic fiber shirts, trousers, knit shirts and blouses, cotton shirts, and combined cotton yarn. Last week, similar restrictions were imposed by the U.S. on cotton trousers, knit shirts, and underwear. Currently, a 2.5 cent charge per item is imposed; the new tariff will raise this to the equivalent of 12 cents per piece now. While this is a fourfold increase, it is not expected to affect consumer prices. Because of this, some doubt the tariff will have any effect on correcting the trade imbalance.\nThis move is in response to U.S. trade quotas imposed due to concerns that increased Chinese goods would put U.S. textile manufacturers out of business. According to Auggie Tantillo, executive director of the American Manufacturing Trade Action Coalition, a textile industry group in the U.S., the move will preserve 10,000 U.S. jobs. The new U.S. trade quota will limit the growth of Chinese textile imports to 7.5 percent compared with shipments over the past year.\nPrior to January 1, a global quota system helped regulate the trade. With the quota system gone, fears have arisen that a flood of Chinese goods could undercut U.S. competitiveness in the market. China is able to market its goods cheaply due to an artificially weak yuan. The U.S. Treasury criticized the China yuan policy as \"highly distortionary\", posing a major risk to China's economy itself and to global economic growth. They challenged China to revalue its currency to bring it to a level they believe will allow fairer competition between global manufacturers.\nChina has disputed the charges of the U.S. Treasury. Chinese Commerce Minister Bo Xilai said, \"I believe they are not reasonable\". \nLaura Jones, a representative of large retailers, also criticized the move, saying \"These restrictions on imports from China will do absolutely nothing to help the U.S. textile industry -- and the government knows it.\"\nChina's Economy.\nChina has seen a boom in economic growth in recent years due to growing trade surpluses with the West, but economists worry that the trade gap will cause longer term global economic problems. China's textile and apparel exports are the most noteworthy example, with exports up over 1,000 percent in some categories this year and the rapid loss of marketshare and jobs by U.S. textile manufacturers.\nBeginning in 1978, the Chinese economy has been transforming from a Soviet-style centrally planned economy to more of a free market style system, under the rigid political control of Communist Party of China.\nTo this end, the government has leveraged foreign trade to stimulate economic growth. The result has been a fourfold increase in GDP, making China the sixth largest economy in the world. By 2012 the People's Republic of China may have the highest GDP in the world.\nAccording to U.S. statistics, from 1999 to 2004 China's trade surplus with the U.S. doubled to $170 billion. Wal-Mart is China's seventh largest export partner, just ahead of the United Kingdom.\nHowever, the gains from their \"socialist market economy\" have not been without problems. The Chinese leadership has often experienced the worst results of socialism and capitalism: bureaucracy, lassitude, corruption, and inflation. Inflation rates have been an on-going challenge, reaching as high as 17% in 1995.\nEnvironmental deterioration is a longer-term threat to economic growth. In 1998, the World Health Organization reported that China had seven of the 10 most-polluted cities on Earth. \nAnother concern among some economists is that China's economy is over-heating, and due to its global economic expansion this could have major repercussions among other nations.\nTypically, wages have been low and working conditions poor, with workers living in restrictive dormitories and working at boring factory jobs. However, recent labor shortages have started improving conditions, and raising the minimum wage towards the equivalent of 100-150 US dollars per month. The labor shortages are in part a result of a demographic trend caused by strict family planning.\nSources.\n "}

The country had become a NATO member (an event which occurred in 2004), it is soon to join the European Union, and people are more optimistic, with higher hopes for the future.\nClinton praised Romania for its involvement in the relief effort for the Indian Ocean tsunami of December 2004, stating that \"This proves you [Romanians] are involved and you want to be more integrated into the international community.\"\nAs to branding Romania, Clinton advised that Romanians should find a phrase or symbol that truly reflects the country and that its residents believe in. He said, \"If 98 percent of Romanians will believe in that phrase, it is good, because they will be able to convince foreigners.\"\nThe former U.S. president said that, before the conference, he had a talk to President B\u0103sescu about marketing.

Romania's economy grew in 2004 by 8.3%, one of the highest growth rates in Europe.\nMeanwhile, Clinton said he thought a more appropriate phrase would be \"find Europe's future here\". He stated that, \"Every Romanian I have met believed in freedom and believed in the future of his country, [a future] which is tied to the US and Europe.\"\nClinton also said that, in order to give Romania a competitive advantage over other countries in the region, it should choose elements that are positive and different from its neighbouring countries. \"You can simply say Romania is bigger. That gives more room for investment,\" he said.\nAside from attending the Beyond Borders conference, Clinton launched the Romanian translation of his autobiography \"My Life\", going to a major bookstore in Bucharest to sign 500 copies of the book. \"My Life\" sells in Romania for 75 new lei, or \u20ac21, with 5000 copies launched in bookstores around the country."}

Bush. Seven Republicans joined with seven Democrats to make the deal.\nThe compromise was announced by Senator John McCain (Rep., Ariz.). McCain said, \"We have reached an agreement to try to avert a crisis in the United States Senate and pull the institution back from a precipice that would have had, in the view of all 14 of us, lasting impact, damaging impact on the institution.\" Future nominees will continue to be filibustered under the terms of this deal but only \"under extraordinary circumstances\", according to McCain.\nBush made 218 nominations in his first term of office, of which 10 were prevented from receiving an up-or-down vote by the Democrats' use of the filibuster. The filibuster is a form of extended debate in which senators hold the floor by speaking continuously, often on unrelated topics, with the purpose of delaying a decision. Senate procedures require 60 votes for \"cloture\", a term for ending the debate and forcing a vote. Since Republicans hold just 55 of the 100 seats in the Senate, they lack the power to force a vote without cooperation from Senate Democrats.\nSenate Majority Leader Bill Frist was not a party to the deal. Frist, along with other Senate Republicans, had been planning to push for a vote to abolish the use of the filibuster on judicial nominees entirely. This widely debated tactic, called either the \"nuclear option\" or the \"constitutional option\", may have been part of the impetus behind the current deal. If the \"nuclear option\" succeeded, some Senate Democrats had threatened to bring non-vital business of the Senate to a halt in protest.\nUnder the current deal, the 14 Senators agree to vote for cloture and allow three judicial nominees to come to a vote: Janice Rogers Brown, William Pryor, and Priscilla Owen. Two other nominees were not part of the deal and may still be filibustered: William Myers and Henry Saad.\nSome of Bush's nominees have been waiting for confirmation for four years. Bush continues to express support for all of his nominees and to request that each one get a vote. On Monday, Bush said, \"I have made my position very clear, and that is my job is to pick people who will interpret the Constitution, not use the bench from which to write law. That's what I campaigned on. I said, if I'm the President, I will pick people who... bring great credit to the bench. And that's exactly what I've done, consistent with judicial philosophy in my picks, as well as the character of the people I pick. And I expect them to get an up or down vote... And I think the American people expect that, as well. People ought to have a fair hearing and they ought to get an up or down vote on the floor.\"\nSenate Minority Leader Harry Reid (Dem., Nevada) opposed Bush's view in a statement Monday. \"[T]he filibuster is one of the Senate's most important tools that guarantees minorities a voice in their government,\" said Reid."}

The journalists \u2014 Marie-Jeanne Ion, Sorin Miscoci and Ovidiu Ohanesian \u2014 were returned by a Hercules military aircraft and were greeted by their families and hundreds of supporters in the Romanian capital. Aside from their families and supporters, the three were also welcomed back by an official Romanian delegation, including President Traian B\u0103sescu and Prime Minister C\u0103lin Popescu-T\u0103riceanu. \nMarie-Jeanne Ion and Sorin Miscoci were the first to exit the plane, and were embraced by their families. They were followed shortly by Ohanesian, who was greeted by his sister and mother. The journalists also embraced the President and Prime Minister, after which they waved at the crowd of supporters. However, none of the journalists made any statements or interviews for the media.\nRomanian media did interview Miscoci's sister and Ion's mother, who both said that they are anxious to see their lives return to normal after the two-month ordeal, expressing faith that the journalists would be able to overcome this experience. The journalists appeared to be in good physical condition.\nBefore rejoining their families, the three journalists are being kept in quarantine for two to three days, time in which they will undergo medical examinations and talk to Romanian officials. While the location of the journalists is not currently known, several Romanian reporters were waiting in front of the Bucharest Military Hospital and the Romanian Intelligence Agency headquarters, hoping to catch a glimpse of the three journalists.\nThe three journalists were kidnapped in Baghdad on March 28, by the Muadh ibn Jabal Brigades. A few weeks after being kidnapped, the terrorists broadcast a tape on Al-Jazeera stating that they would kill the journalists if Romania did not withdraw its 860 troops from Iraq. However, due to efforts of the Romanian secret service and collaboration between several intelligence agencies, the group were freed on May 23, where they were placed in the hands of the Romanian Embassy in Baghdad.\nPresident Traian B\u0103sescu did not elaborate on the details of the journalists' release, saying instead that further details would be given when the investigation into their kidnapping is complete. B\u0103sescu thanked the Iraqi authorities and Romania's Muslim community, most of which is made up of Kurdish refugees and Arab immigrants, for helping in the negotiations. Lastly, he thanked the families of the hostages for \"the decency and elegance of their behavior in public\" as well as the Romanian media for supporting the government in the release of the hostages.\nThe Romanian Prime Minister, C\u0103lin Popescu-T\u0103riceanu, said that the successful outcome of this crisis shows that the government is capable of defending both its citizens and the national interests of Romania, referring to the fact that in the release of the hostages, no ransom was paid and no troops were withdrawn.\nInternational leaders and representatives also praised the event. The United States Embassy in Bucharest said that they are \"extremely satisfied that the crisis ended with the safe release of the hostages,\" while UK Ambassador to Romania Quinton Quayle met B\u0103sescu and congratulated him for his ability to manage the crisis and co-ordinate secret services, especially the fact that Romania made no compromises for the release of the journalists. Josep Borrell, the head of the European Parliament, said that the positive result of this crisis proves \"we can never lose hope\" and that the world must now continue to fight for the release of other hostages held in Iraq."}

The day commemorates 100 years since the Aromanian people were recognised by Turkish Sultan Abdul Hamid II. \nAromanians are a distinct ethnic group currently living mainly in Southeastern Europe, especially Greece and Macedonia. The Aromanians are closely related to the Romanian people, both being descendants from the Latin peoples which lived in Southeastern Europe since the time of the Roman Empire. The Aromanian language, which is spoken by around 500,000 people internationally, is the closest language to Romanian.\nDespite their relative size, Aromanians have very little, if no, minority rights. In Greece, for example, they are not recognised as a minority. In Romania, where there are an increasing number of Aromanians, many of them migrating from Greece, Macedonia and Albania, they are often considered as Romanians, because their language is partly mutually-intelligible with Romanian and their culture is relatively similar. However, there is currently a movement in Romania to give the Aromanians a status as a separate ethnic group, therefore entitling them to parliamentary representation and education in the Aromanian language, among other rights."}

Michael Dudley, a child and adolescent psychiatrist at Sydney Children's Hospital who has visited the mother and daughter, spoke on the program of the importance of children mixing with others their own age, and the harm that prolonged detention was doing to Naomi.\n\"I mean that's crucial to social development and emotional development in children and also, a sense of identity development and so on.

Prime Minister John Howard has indicated that he is mindful of the need for compassion, but he does not support a conscience vote.\n\"Mandatory detention is not a matter of conscience.

The man who has thus far refused to talk, has demonstrated himself to be an excellent pianist\u2014earning him the nickname \"Piano Man\".\nSince publication of our first article, we have been contacted by a fellow wiki contributor informing us that the \"Piano Man\" may be a British actor named Geoffrey Betts. Although our contact strongly believed he knew the identity of the man and contacted the relevant authorities in regard to his belief, this has turned out to be false. While Betts was not reachable by phone or e-mail, his website was recently updated to the effect that he is \"not\" the man in question. In the meantime, the search for the identity has been narrowed down to three leads by authorities.\nThe original interview between Wikinews editor and contributor is reproduced below.\nThe Interview.\nCG: Who do you think the pianist is?&lt;br&gt;\nS: Geoffrey \"Geoff\" Betts, an actor and British citizen, who I last knew to be living in Euless, Texas (a suburb of Dallas), and who, the last time I saw him was living temporarily months at a time in Louisville, Kentucky.\nCG: Why do you think it is him?&lt;br&gt;\nS: The person I knew should be 26, perhaps almost 27 now. The personal resemblances are the eyes, facial shape, asymmetric jawline, ears, nose and short hair. The person I knew had colored his hair blonde at least one time when I knew him. His mother is Italian, and his father is British, and the \"Piano Man\" has the appearance of such an ethnic combination. I also knew that he composed music, but frankly, I did not know he could play the piano. Both the man found and Geoff are thin and physically fit. I also knew Geoff to be a smart dresser.\nCG: What is your relationship with Mr. Betts; were you good friends?&lt;br&gt;\nS: He is a former business associate of an ex-partner of mine in an upstart film production company that has since gone out of business. Geoff actually lived with us for periods of time in 2003. I would call him a friendly acquaintance, if not a friend, during that time.\nCG: What is your knowledge of Mr. Betts' musical ability?&lt;br&gt;\nS: I knew Geoff to compose his own music, but I cannot remember offhand what kind of music.\nCG: When was the last time you met Mr. Betts - was it long before the man turned up in England?&lt;br&gt;\nS: Early 2004, when Geoff last moved out of the residence where I and my ex-partner were living. I had heard various stories for months after that point regarding him continuing to live in Texas and occasionally visit Louisville, but I had no firsthand knowledge of that.\nCG: What was Mr. Betts involved in in the weeks before the appearance of the man in England? Was he working on a film, on a break etc? &lt;br&gt;\nS: According to IMDB, Geoff was working on a film recently, but I am not sure of the timing of that with respect to the time the man appeared in England. I have no information on where he might have been in the weeks before the man's appearance.\nCG: On a scale of 1 to 10, how sure are you that the man is actually Mr. Betts?&lt;br&gt;\nS: 8. I admit I am not as confident as the Polish man living in Italy was (with his 99% certainty that it was his friend Massone), and it turned out he was incorrect. I have to say, however, that I am haunted by how much the \"Piano Man\" resembles Geoff. Further, the reports indicate the man is 6' while Geoff is 5'10\"--I don't know whether the man found was measured with his shoes on or not. Last, my attempts to contact Geoff by a direct email address I found has failed to get any response. I am almost tossing and turning with about whether the man found could be Geoff or not.\nCG: I know you have already contacted the relevant authorities, but if there was one thing about Mr. Betts that you believe could help further in verification of the pianists identity; what would it be?&lt;br&gt;\nS: Geoff's website at http://www.geoffreybetts.com for physical comparison. Also, his mother may still be living in Euless, TX. Last, strangely enough, he also had a wish list at Amazon.com, and one of the last two items he added on April 4 (apparently just before the appearance of the man in England) is an audio CD titled \"Silence.\"\nPhoto Comparison.\nA comparison can be made of images of the \"Piano Man\" and Geoff using the below links:\nSources.\n "}

In a few years, Voyager 1 is expected to become the first man-made object to cross into interstellar space.\n\"Voyager has entered the final lap on its race to the edge of interstellar space, as it begins exploring the solar system's final frontier,\" said Dr. Edward Stone, Voyager project scientist at the California Institute of Technology.\nAs long ago as 2003, scientists thought Voyager 1 was entering the termination shock region of the solar system, but there was some dispute. The termination shock is the area preceding the heliosheath, where the electrically charged solar wind is slowed and concentrated by contact with interstellar gas.\nThe heliosheath is considered the outer edge of our solar system. Around it is the heliopause, a cosmic bubble where the pressure of solar wind and interstellar wind is in balance. \nThe solar system as a whole is in orbit around the center of the Milky Way galaxy. As it plows through clouds of interstellar gas and dust, a bow shock forms ahead of it, which has been compared to the turbulence a ship creates as it sails through ocean currents. All this is illustrated in the NASA diagram shown here.\nVoyager 1 is still operational and sending back reams of scientific data. Already notable for more than 27 years of successful operation, Voyager 1 is projected to continue operating on its plutonium power source possibly until the year 2020.\nVoyager 2, its companion probe launched the same year, has visited more planets than any other spacecraft. It too is eventually expected to exit the solar system at a more downward angle, but is currently only 80% as far from the sun as Voyager 1.\nThe Voyagers are not only gathering data about the cosmos, they are sending the greetings of the human world out to it. Each Voyager contains what is known as the \"Voyager Golden Record\", which is an audio recording on a 12-inch gold plated copper disc. The discs contain samples of nature sounds, spoken greetings in 55 human languages, and musical compositions. \nThe collection of samples was supervised by astronomer Carl Sagan, and is intended to convey the hopefulness of life on Earth for possible discovery by alien races or retrieval by some advanced human civilization."}

The IRC has said it reported to the U.S. government detainee's reports of desecration of the Qur'an.\nThe ACLU's Freedom of Information Act requests turned up U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) reports which echo the IRC's concerns. The documents are purported to show a consistency with reports from detainees of abuse to their religious symbols, as well as reports of beatings and other interrogation methods.\nAmnesty International's Secretary General, in her introduction to the report, points to the United State's foreign and military policy as providing a justification for other governments to ignore human rights.\n\"The USA, as the unrivalled political, military and economic hyper-power, sets the tone for governmental behaviour worldwide. When the most powerful country in the world thumbs its nose at the rule of law and human rights, it grants a licence to others to commit abuse with impunity,\" said Irene Khan.\nWhite House spokesman Scott McClellan responded saying the report's allegations were \"ridiculous and unsupported by the facts. The United States is leading the way when it comes to protecting human rights and promoting human dignity. We have liberated 50 million people in Iraq and Afghanistan. We have worked to advance freedom and democracy in the world so that people are governed under a rule of law and that there are... protections in place for minority rights, that women's rights are advanced so that women can fully participate in societies where now they cannot\", as well as supporting the fight against AIDS in Africa.\nAbout the allegations of abuse at Guantanamo, which McClellan has previously called isolated incidents, he said, \"We hold people accountable when there is abuse. We take steps to prevent it from happening again, and we do so in a very public way for the world to see that we lead by example, and that we do have values that we hold very dearly and believe in.\""}

Milan's veteran Paolo Maldini scored in the first minute of the match after a corner kick. After Hernan Crespo scored twice for Milan before half-time, it looked like Liverpool had no chance. But the Reds' performance changed dramatically after half-time. Steven Gerrard was the first to score for Liverpool, inspiring the rest of the team. In a quick succession Milan's goalkeeper Dida saw the goals of Vladimir Smicer and Xabi Alonso (the latter scored after a controversial penalty decision) in his net. \nAfter the equalizer the game was even and both teams took a cautious approach. After 90 minutes the score was still 3-3 and so it went to extra time. Jerzy Dudek made two incredible saves off of Andriy Shevchenko shots in the last minutes of extra time to push the contest into a penalty shootout. Then, again, Polish goalkeeper Dudek saved the day for Liverpool by stoping two shots. Liverpool won, scoring three penalties to Milan's two.\nMilan supporters were very disappointed at the loss. Silvio Berlusconi, the owner of AC Milan, as well as Prime Minister of Italy, said: \"Milan played much better throughout. We created move after move while they didn't create one move worthy of the name. What a shame.\" Italian sport newspaper Gazetta della Sport commented: \"Incredible. Milan lost on penalties a cup that it had already won. It lost it badly, very badly. A team which scores three goals in the first 45 minutes, outclasses its adversary, stuns it with staggering moves, cannot let in three goals in six minutes.\"\nThose who supported Liverpool were delighted at the unexpected victory. England national team coach Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson praised Liverpool's performance, saying: \"What a game it was, heroic. I've never seen a European final like that ever, it is great news for all of us working in English football.\" Triumphant Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard said he is \"on top of the world\" and also said he would stay with Liverpool after this victory, despite interest from such clubs as Real Madrid and Chelsea.\nLiverpool (4-4-1-1): Dudek; Finnan (Hamann, h-t), Hyypi\u00e4, Carragher, Traore; Garcia, Alonso, Gerrard, Riise; Kewell (Smicer, 23); Baros (Ciss\u00e9, 84).

The parents aired their concerns over health issues at schools and workplaces, including a rash of cases in the student population, and began a dialogue they have been working toward for years.\nRepresentatives of Markland Manufacturing and of AQMD also spoke at the meeting, explaining their positions. The outcome of the meeting was that Senator Dunn and members of the community will tour the Markland facility and meet with county officials, and another public meeting will be held in a couple of weeks.\nTown hall meeting called in response to concerns.\nConcerned parents and teachers gathered at Kennedy Elementary School in Santa Ana, California for the 6:30 p.m. meeting hosted by California State Senator Joe Dunn. Principal Felix Mendoza, Donald Markland - President of Markland Manufacturing, members of the South Coast Air Quality Management District (AQMD), and representatives from the Orange County Sanitation District (OCSD), Orange County Water District (OCWD), California Safe Schools, and California Environmental Rights Alliance participated in the meeting. Senator Dunn organized the meeting to address concerns of teachers who work at, and parents whose children attend both Kennedy and nearby Franklin Elementary School.\nFive boys attending Franklin were diagnosed with the same type of leukemia in Spring 2002, raising the initial concerns. Attempts to gain an investigation from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) into possible causes were not successful as the case cluster, though intense, still fell into the range of natural chance.\nDuring the corresponding time period, in December of 2002, the Orange County Sanitation Department had cited and fined Markland Manufacturing, a business located directly across the street from Kennedy Elementary, $21,000, a second time, for illegally dumping , , , and into city sewers. These toxic substances have a range of health risks from carcinogenic to reduced IQ and increase in fatality risk. Markland Manufacturing is a steel plating company located directly across the street from Kennedy Elementary School.\nRecently, Markland applied for a permit from the AQMD to expand its facilities. Whenever a company changes equipment, and those changes affect air quality, the AQMD must issue a notice to all residents in the affected area. In response, parents called Senator Dunn's office voicing their concerns, and Dunn organized a town hall meeting to address the issues. He invited experts in air, water, and sewage to address the community. \"Leukemia is an air quality issue,\" said Dunn.\nMeeting report in detail.\nSenator Dunn began the meeting by thanking everyone at Kennedy Elementary School, Principal Felix Mendoza, and the Santa Ana Unified School District (SAUSD). He then introduced the first three members of the panel: Parents Gloria Maldonado and Socorro Molina, and teacher Tammy Sanchez.\n\"I was concerned about the permit,\" said 10-year resident and Kennedy parent Gloria Maldonado. \"I contacted the school administration, and I was ignored. Where is our city council?\"\nNext to speak was Franklin parent Socorro Molina. Her son Steven was diagnosed with in May of 2002, along with four others at Franklin, and she wants an investigation. She says apartment kids are suffering from leukemia and dying.\nTammy Sanchez is a teacher at Franklin, and several of her students have been diagnosed with leukemia. She noted that all of the children who were diagnosed leukemia lived in front of Franklin Elementary. She went to the school nurse, and together they wrote a letter to the CDC asking for an investigation. They responded by saying that the cases were \"within the range\". \"That's hard to believe,\" said Sanchez. She then turned to the Leukemia Society, and they too turned her down. In April of 2004, one of her students, Reynaldo, passed away due to leukemia. That summer, another boy at Franklin died from leukemia. \"They all lived in apartments,\" she said. She kept searching, and in November of last year, another student at Franklin, Manuel, passed away. On January 2 this year, two twins that were going to attend Franklin died from acute lymphocytic leukemia. In February, a student at nearby Santa Ana High School died from leukemia. This weekend, a teacher from Franklin died of lung cancer. \"I don't know what it is, but something isn't right in this area. There is clearly something amiss here,\" said Sanchez.\nSenator Dunn then allowed Markland Manufacturing President Don Markland to respond to what the parents and teacher said. He responded, \"[Before moving to our current location], I met with the City Council and the School Board; I went above and beyond what is called for.\" He said that the city told him that his business would be assisting in city beautification. When confronted about whether his business was responsible for the health issues, he said, \"I'm not really a technical person. I hire assistants.\"\nNext, Senator Dunn introduced members of the AQMD: Anupom Ganguli, Carol Coy, Jill Whynot; and other experts: Ron Wildermuth, Communications Director, Orange County Water District; Kelly Christensen, Source Control Supervisor, Orange County Sanitation District; and Joseph K. Lyou, Executive Director of California Safe Schools.\nFirst to speak was Anupom Ganguli. \"All residents deserve to live and work in a safe, clean environment,\" Anupom said. He said that \"75% of air pollution comes from the burning of diesel fuels. Air quality is a major health issue, of particular concern is children.\" He went on to say, \"Teens in highly polluted areas are five times more likely to have lung problems than teens not in polluted areas.\"\nThe next AQMD representative to speak was Carol Coy. \"Any business that has a machine that emits or causes air pollution requires a permit... Markland is a plating company, which deals with liquid metals; more specifically, chrome... When the chemicals evaporate, onsite machines refine as much air pollution as possible. Markland is getting a permit to modify a piece of equipment, and a public notice is required for all pollutant increases,\" she said. Markland received three emissions violations from AQMD. \"They're in good shape,\" said Coy.\nThe final speaker from AQMD was Jill Whynot. Jill clarified that \"AQMD has no authority over land use\". Therefore, placement of manufacturing industries next to residences (as has happened with Markland Manufacturing) is left to the authority of county and city council.\nNext to speak was Joseph K. Lyou, Executive Director of California Environmental Rights Alliance. \"What we're concerned about is false negatives,\" he said. \"Our focus should be how we can reduce emissions and pollution in our communities.\" Robina Suwol, Executive Director of California Safe Schools, noted that \"the standards are based upon a 160 pound male,\" not on children who are a fraction of the weight and size.\nThe final speaker was Ron Wildermuth, Communications Director of the Orange County Water District. He said, \"Your water meets all standards, or it doesn't get served.\"\nDunn then opened the floor to public comments.\nSocorro Molina, in response to Markland's comments, exclaimed, \"Why in front of the school? Why near children?\" Jill Whynot of AQMD responded by saying, \"We have a proposed rule that will be voted on in a few months that would allow us to tell a business to not locate in a certain area.\"\nVictoria Zaragoza, a resident of nearby Minnie Street, lashed, \"I am outrage that there are so many pollutants. You [AQMD] don't test the air, you just test the companies. Between late 2001 and early 2002, 19 women living at the Williams Street apartment complex were diagnosed with cancer. We have high levels of lead. Our children have asthma and lung problems. It's not the norm. I want that to be clear. You have not answered our questions, you just talked around them. We take this seriously. It's our lives.\"\nA mother of a 6 year-old at Franklin told the panel that her daughter is having nosebleeds constantly. \"She has eight nosebleeds per month.\" When she went to her local doctor, she was told that the bleeding was caused by allergies. \"I had to pay for a private doctor to tell me it was the school's environment,\" she said.\nAnother mother voiced concerns about her child: \"My daughter had . Next to where I live, there is a shop where they paint cars and cut metal, and it all blows toward me. When I called the city of Santa Ana, they told me to move. [This] city does not consider the Hispanics. I ended up calling the police. [When they arrived], they said 'is it life or death, because otherwise we are going to leave'. I want you [AQMD] to pay attention to not only to large businesses, but to the small stuff.\"\nLazara Bustos, a parent of three children, with one attending Franklin, had this to say: \"Since I learned about the sick kids at Franklin, I've been concerned. I want an investigation of all businesses in Santa Ana. I went all the way to Sacramento and told them about all of the sick kids in the hospitals- too many sick kids. I gathered 200 signatures from parents to get inspections. We don't know if [the inspections] will happen.\" She continued, \"The city slaps us with fines, when the rich businessmen exploit our workers with very low wages. They are becoming rich at the expense of the poor.\" She was told that leukemia was caused by nutrition problems.\nMaria Parada's son Diego was diagnosed with leukemia in 2002. \"He's fighting really hard. I thank God he's still alive.\" She began to cry. \"I am really scared for all the other mothers going through this.\" About her son, she said, \"I don't know if he's going to make it\".\nWhen asked about the citations given to Markland, the company's legal counselor, Steve Ellis, said that they \"were just allegations\". He claims that \"some things\" got into the sewers, and that it happened \"over a year ago\". Tammy Sanchez noted that Markland was fined in December 2002 for \"illegal disposal of nickel, copper, lead, and arsenic into sewers\". The Markland lawyer's response was \"Is it currently happening, no. The sewers at Markland are more than 12 feet below the ground, not endangering residents.\" Don Markland then called up his Technical Consultant, who stated: \"Employees were doing this independent of Markland administration\".\nSenator Dunn wrapped up by saying: \"Even if Markland is fully compliant, there is still something amiss here\". Dunn promised to have an open meeting with city and school officials. He will tour the Markland facility with members of the community, and meet with county officials to find out what is causing the health issues. Dunn also promised to hold another town hall meeting in a couple of weeks.\nMedia.\nArial photo of Markland Manufacturing plant (to the north), and Kennedy Elementary (to the south).

Chinese researchers measure tallest mountain", "text": ", \nMount Qomolangma, known in the west as Mount Everest, may be taller than ever, and a group of 24 Chinese researchers have scaled the peak and made observations they hope will document its current height.\nIn 1975 the peak was surveyed at a height of 8 848 metres, in line with previous calculations, but a U.S. survey team in 1999 measured it at 8 850m. The growth to some extent fits current theories regarding the geology of the region, a region with crustal upthrust. The growth may also be due in part to rapid glacier retreat on the peak's slopes, and the mountain springing back as the weight of snow melts and runs off.\nAt the same time, recent theories suggest the mountain is also shrinking. The peak may be getting smaller from subsidence as it reaches extreme heights, and again the glaciers and snow help to stabilize and expand the mountain itself.\nThere is some disagreement regarding the methods of measurement used previously, so the researchers spent an hour at the summit taking measurements using radar, satellite, and other methods on 6 points. The average of the measurements will be used to make the official Chinese measurement, which remains at 8 848. Results of the expedition are expected to be available in August.\nA previous measurement team from Italy also used the radar methodology in 2004, but their results have not yet been published.\nThe mountain straddles the border between Tibet and Nepal, and is known by several names.

He played a significant role in urging the US to ban DDT, which it did in 1972, and was instrumental in starting Earth Day.\nEddie Albert's most recent movie role was in 1995's \"The Barefoot Executive.\""}

The request, written by Boston constitutional attorney John C. Bonifaz on behalf of the citizen groups, cites the Downing Street memo and issues surrounding the planning and execution of the Iraq war. The full text of the request is available here.\nThe request was written on behalf of several groups, including:\nAnd cites the possible grounds for impeachment:\nBonifaz says that the official minutes of a secret US-UK meeting were the impetus for the request. Those minutes were recently leaked to \"The Sunday Times\", and are popularly known as the \"Downing Street memo\" or alternatively the \"smoking gun memo\". In it, British intelligence MI-6 director Richard Dearlove said, \"Bush wanted to remove Saddam, through military action, justified by the conjunction of terrorism and WMD. But the intelligence and facts were being fixed around the policy.\"\nThe phrase \"the intelligence and facts were being fixed around the policy.\" has been the center of attention in reports and discussions surrounding the memo. It has received this attention because critics of the Iraq war believe that it reaffirms their fundamental criticisms: that Bush's decision to go to war was not based on the intelligence, but, rather, intelligence was used selectively and exaggerated, while debunking intelligence was forcefully suppressed, for the sole purpose of rallying consent for the war, and that this was all done deliberately.\nBonifaz wrote: \"The recent release of the Downing Street Memo provides new and compelling evidence that the President of the United States has been actively engaged in a conspiracy to deceive and mislead the United States Congress and the American people.\"\nSome Republican congressmen who had voted for the war have since stated that they believe the war was a mistake. For example, Walter Jones, the coiner of the phrase \"freedom fries\", is now the most vociferous opponent on Capitol Hill. \"If we were given misinformation intentionally by people in this administration, to commit the authority to send boys, and in some instances girls, to go into Iraq, that is wrong,\" he has stated, \"Congress must be told the truth.\"\nOn May 26th, the group AfterDowningStreet.org launched a campaign to Congress to investigate whether President Bush committed impeachable offenses relating to the Iraq war."}

Commerce Department Deputy Director Lelei Peau was participating in a regional seminar held from May 17-19 in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines by the U.N. Decolonization Committee.\nThe U.N. has promoted decolonization since its founding, particularly since its Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples was adopted in 1960. In 1945, about one-third of the world's population lived in dependent, non-self governing Territories. Today the U.N. lists 16 remaining colonies with fewer than 2 million total people.\nAmerican Samoa is asking to be removed from that list, on the grounds that it wishes to remain a freely associated territory of the United States. Its position has remained unchanged since the Lieutenant Governor first asked to be removed from the list in 1993.\n\"The position of the people of American Samoa, and its duly elected legislative representatives and government officials is that the current status of the Territory and the United States government is the desired relationship we wish to have,\" said Governor Togiola T. A. Tulafono last year. His message was delivered to the U.N. Decolonization Committee in their regional seminar held in the Pacific island country of Papua New Guinea.\n\"It has been a partnership that has aided both our peoples and the bonds of friendship between us are strong. We ask again that American Samoa be delisted as a 'colony' of the United States,\" said the governor's message.\nThe United States position, expressed to the U.N. General Assembly in 2003, is that its remaining territories are already in large measure self-governing. These territories should be able to choose whether to be independent states as \"equal and sovereign partners\" of the United States, or remain integrated within the United States.\nThe legislature of American Samoa, called the Fono, has approved a Future Political Status Commission to study public opinion on possibly becoming a commonwealth or freely associated state.\nSources.\n "}

Of France's 42 million eligible voters, over 70% turned out at the 55 thousand polling stations across the country, which were open from 8:00 to 20:00 on Sunday (except in Paris and Lyon where voting finished at 22:00, and French oversea possessions and other polling centers in the Americas, which voted on Saturday in order not to have them vote when the results are already known). A 70% turnout is very large compared to Spain 42%.\nThe result comes as no surprise to European political commentators as opinion polls had consistently suggested that the \"No\" camp was on course for a strong victory. Indeed, the last opinion poll before the actual referendum suggested a 56% win for the \"No\" camp.\nThe treaty was supported by all 3 major political parties (center-left PS, center-right UMP, center-right UDF), though a significant minority of the PS, and some in the UMP, chose to oppose it.\nIt was opposed by the French Communist Party, as well as Trotskyite movements such as the Revolutionary Communist League, other far-left movements such as the Party of the Workers, parts of the Socialist party, parts of The Greens some members of UMP, and the nationalist National Front.\nAccording to polls, the vast majority of blue collar workers, farmers and other categories threatened by globalization and international concurrence voted against the treaty. The urban, better educated or richer population voted in favor.\nSome supporters of the \"No\" camp have argued that the mainstream media was biased in favor of the \"yes\" cause, and this was supported by some analyses of times awarded by television to both camps. However, the \"no\" camp also waged an aggressive campaign, with the walls of major cities being plastered with posters linking the EU Constitution and the European Union to all kind of social ills, such as high unemployment.\nYou can read the entire proposed \nPolls.\nAccording to polls collected by TNS-Sofres, the largest polling company in France, voters gave the following reasons for voting no:\nNote, however, that such polls offer only a limited number of answers and may thus misrepresent the actual motives of the people.\nArguments of the \"No\" vote.\nProponents of the \"No\" vote, both on the left and right, argued that the proposed constitution enshrined what they claim is an undemocratic Europe, with much of the responsibilities granted to a body of unelected political appointees, the European Commission and not enough checks and balances. They also point out that it vests much legislative power in the European Council, representing the executives of the various countries; this is seen as a bad arrangement with respect to Separation of powers. While the treaty adds supplemental powers for the directly elected European Parliament, many opponents, particularly on the left, consider that they are still insufficient in order to provide checks and balances.\nMuch criticism was directed at the length of the proposed Constitution. The real treaty submitted to French voters is about 80 pages long, which many argue is too long and complex for a constitution. It is followed by 100 pages of appendices, declarations and protocols, some of them dealing with matters such as oil refining in the Dutch West Indies or specific nuclear power plants in Eastern Europe.\nOpponents of the treaty argue that the proposed constitution will largely hamstring the French government and prevent it from leading its own policies in matters as diverse as social services or foreign policy.\nMuch of the opposition was targeted at Part\u00a0III of the proposed constitution, which sets the policies of the European Union. Opponents point out that the constitutions of most countries, including France, do not specify policies explicitly, except for a limited number of fundamental rights, but rather are limited to specifying the core principles and procedures of how governmental institutions work. Part\u00a0III, they argued, sets in stone a number of economic and social choices, while these should be a matter of political choice depending on democratic votes.\nBoth left-wing and right-wing opponents consider that some of these policies, already applied and enforced by the European Union, are disastrous for France's economy and society as well as European's economy and society. One primary target is the free trade policies with countries having less expensive workforce and social protection, which, they argue, drive French workers out of work (2.7 million French people are out of work).\nThis was recently exemplified by the so-called \"Bolkestein directive\", which would have enabled service providers in the European Union to work anywhere in the union according to the legislation and social practices of their own country, not of the country where they'd work: this was caricatured as the example of the \"Polish plumber\" coming to work for a meager fraction of what French plumbers demand.\nMuch is made of \"d\u00e9localisations\" \u2014 that is, the transferring of industries and, now, services to countries with lower production costs, depriving French workers of jobs at a time when unemployment is high.\nAs a consequence, both left-wing and right-wing opponents of the treaty and of current and proposed European Union policies argue in favor of some sort of protectionism.\nIn the field of international relations, many opponents contend that the proposed constitution would make the European Union largely subservient to NATO, an institution dominated by the United States of America.\nA factor in the opposition to the constitution is the recent enlargement of the European Union, a major move which was not approved by a referendum. Opponents consider that open border concurrence with much poorer economies is bad for French economy; many express uneasiness at subsidizing and collaborating with governments that they consider subservient to the interests of the United States, such as Poland's (Poland chose to buy warplanes from the United States after receiving some European Union subsidies, a movement which resulted in many questioning the financial and diplomatic priorities of their government).\nFinally, many seized the occasion to express their discontent at France's political elite and to president Jacques Chirac and Prime Minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin's government. While unemployment had receded under the rule of center-left former prime minister Lionel Jospin, it has climbed against under Raffarin's administration despite his and Chirac's promises.\nLeft-wing arguments.\nMuch opposition was directed towards what many on the Left consider the \"ultra-liberal\" character of the Constitution: that is, they argue, the proposed constitution makes permanent economic policies which they consider disastrous for French society:\nLeft wing opponents, they say, want Europe, but another Europe, which, in their view, would put the concerns of common people before those of financial markets and the wealthy. They contend that free market capitalism, which they consider enforced by the constitution, destroys lives and benefits the financial establishment, but not the average worker. They argue that open trade and concurrence encourages unemployment in France.\nThey argue, bluntly, that the constitution is the constitution of right-winger Chirac and MEDEF, the union of larger French private employers. MEDEF, due to its current leader Ernest-Antoine Seilli\u00e8re, is very unpopular among the left.\nLeft-wing opponents argued that the Charter of rights included in the constitution was largely indicative, not prescriptive. They questioned the say that other members of the union may have in matters such as the right to abortion and the separation of Church and State, which they consider threatened by certain governments from Catholic countries, which, during the negotiation of the treaties, had insisted on adding references to the Christian heritage of Europe.\nAnother argument from the left was that the Constitution called for member states to strengthen their military forces. Opponents argue that this would be wasteful spending, would result in an arm race with the United States, China and others, and would result in wars and more instability.\nMany leaders of the opposition to the \"No\" also simply called for a blow to Chirac.\nRight-wing arguments.\nMany right-wing opponents argue that Turkey, which has applied for European Union membership, should not become a member, and that acceptance of the Constitution would pave the way for this. They point out that the new Eastern European members, whose joining many of them opposed, were accepted without a referendum; they also point out that Turkey is for the most part not located in Europe, but in the Middle-East, and that it borders countries such as Iran and Iraq.\nIn addition, many supporters of the right-wing are opposed to a union with countries whose culture they consider too far from France, and are concerned about unchecked immigration from these. They also consider that the direction the European Union is heading will only reinforce unchecked immigration from poor Muslim countries, which they think is bad socially and economically for Europe. This point of view is disputed by many economists, who point out that due to aging of France and other European countries increasing immigration is the only viable option for boosting the existing economies.\nSuch arguments are likely not to have much impact on many French voters. The results of this referendum, as well as those of the 2002 presidential election, show some deep distrust of the population for the political class as well as for \"experts\". There is high skepticism against economists and politicians who promote what they consider to be necessary reforms, whereas despite those reforms unemployment has remained high and standards of living have lessened for many.\nArguments of the \"YES\" vote.\nSupporters of the proposed European Constitution contend that it is a marked improvement over preceding treaties governing the European Union. They point out that it gives increased powers to the directly elected European Parliament compared to the politically appointed European Commission and European Council. They also point out that it gives a right of petition to European citizens, which they contend is a marked democratic advance. Opponents point out that this right may be exercised only with strict conditions (1,000,000 signatures from a \"significant\" number of countries) and with uncertain consequences. Furthermore, they point out that the basic undemocratic handling and procedures followed for the legislative enactment of laws are kept in place, and that neither the EC or the counsel of ministers have been internally made more democratic.\nProponents of the constitution consider that these improvements make the European Union markedly more democratic than it was before, while opponents may be of the opinion that something which is better then extremely bad, is still no good, and consider a no-vote a chance to come up with something better. Some supporters of the constitution contend that certain European measures that many consider ill-advised (such as the Bolkestein directive or the directive on software patents) would not have been adopted if the stronger checks and balances provided for by the constitution had been implemented, but there is little actual basis to support such a claim.\nPart\u00a0II of the proposed European Constitution is a \"Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union\". This charter lists a number of human rights, such as the prohibition of torture, the prohibition of the death penalty, etc., and reinstates that the Union follows the Council of Europe's (COE) European Convention on Human Rights and the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR). All members of the European Union must belong to the COE and accept ECHR jurisdiction. Proponents of the constitution consider that this reinstatement of human rights is of great import, especially with respect to recent new members, which may not have much of a tradition of democracy, rule of law and human rights.\nProponents of the constitution dispel the accusation that the constitution is \"ultra-lib\u00e9ral\" (i.e. supports unfettered free market and prohibits social policies in member countries). They contend that these dispositions are not new, and were already to be found in the 1957 Treaty of Rome. They point out that unbiased concurrence is a the heart of European policies since the beginnings of the European Economic Community.\nThey contend that, for a large part, the proposed constitution is just the consolidation of the preceding treaties governing the European Union into a single document.\nThey admit out that the Constitution, like all works designed by a committee out of compromise, may be bulky. However, they point out, France cannot expect to force its choices on other countries. While some French parties may have preferred that the constitution contains more \"social\" dispositions, such social dispositions would be opposed by countries such as the United Kingdom, and there is little hope that any renegotiation would get them accepted. French Citizens, they claim, should be ready to accept an imperfect text.\nSome supporters say that refusing the constitution will diminish the clout of France in European institutions and may make it more difficult in the future to have its interests be taken into account at that level.\nSome right-wing supporters of the treaty contend that the European Union is a necessary force in order to push what they consider to be necessary reforms upon France.\nSupporters of the treaty point out that the question of the constitution is disconnected from that of the accession of Turkey. President Chirac has pledged that the accession of Turkey would be put to a referendum before French voters (the accession treaty of former Eastern Bloc countries was ratified by the French Parliament without a referendum).\nFinally, supporters of the proposed Constitution point out that this referendum is about the ratification of a treaty, and is not a plebiscite on the actions of president Jacques Chirac and prime minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin, both of which are deeply unpopular."}
