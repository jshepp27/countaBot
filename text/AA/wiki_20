Lift-off, from area 132/1 at the Plesetsk Cosmodrome in Northern Russia, occurred at 17:15 GMT. The launch, which was originally scheduled to occur today, was moved up to Tuesday, and subsequently delayed twice due to strong winds at an altitude of 13 kilometres, which prevented launch.\nSAR-Lupe is a German reconnaissance satellite constellation, consisting of five spacecraft. The first of these was launched in December 2006. The next satellite, SAR-Lupe 5, is scheduled for launch sometime around October 2008. The spacecraft are equipped with Synthetic Apperture Radar (SAR), which allows them to produce imagery at night, and through cloud cover.\nThe carrier rocket which was used, Kosmos-3M, is a derivative of the Soviet R-14 missile. It first flew in 1967, and the launch of SAR-Lupe 4 marks its 442nd flight. It is also the 900th launch of a member of the R-14 family of rockets.\nThe launch was declared successful, with the satellite reaching orbit at 17:43 GMT.

According to NASA, the discovery was made when Cassini flew by the moon on March 12.\n\"A completely unexpected surprise is that the chemistry of Enceladus, what's coming out from inside, resembles that of a comet. To have primordial material coming out from inside a Saturn moon raises many questions on the formation of the Saturn system,\" said Hunter Waite, principal investigator for the Cassini Ion and Neutral Mass Spectrometer at the Southwest Research Institute located in San Antonio, Texas.\nThe Ion and Neutral Mass Spectrometer saw a much higher density of volatile gases, water vapor, carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide, as well as organic materials, some 20 times denser than expected. This dramatic increase in density was evident as the spacecraft flew over the area of the plumes.\nNew high-resolution heat maps of the south pole by Cassini's Composite Infrared Spectrometer show that the so-called tiger stripes, giant fissures that are the source of the geysers, are warm along almost their entire lengths, and reveal other warm fissures nearby. These more precise new measurements reveal temperatures of at least minus 93 degrees Celsius (minus 135 Fahrenheit.) That is 17 degrees Celsius (63 degrees Fahrenheit) warmer than previously seen and 93 degrees Celsius (200 degrees Fahrenheit) warmer than other regions of the moon. The warmest regions along the tiger stripes correspond to two of the jet locations seen in Cassini images.\n\"Enceladus has got warmth, water and organic chemicals, some of the essential building blocks needed for life. We have quite a recipe for life on our hands, but we have yet to find the final ingredient, liquid water, but Enceladus is only whetting our appetites for more,\" said Dennis Matson, Cassini project scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California.\nAt closest approach, Cassini was only 30 miles from Enceladus. When it flew through the plumes it was 120 miles from the moon's surface. Cassini's next flyby of Enceladus is in August."}

The film stars Drake Bell, Sara Paxton, Christopher McDonald, Pamela Anderson, Tracy Morgan, Regina Hall, Craig Bierko, Simon Rex, Leslie Nielsen, Marion Ross, Kevin Hart, Jeffrey Tambor, Ryan Hansen, Brent Spiner and Keith David. \nDrake Bell plays Rick Riker, a young man figuring out how to use his superpowers. The film parodies blockbuster superhero movies including Spider-Man, Batman, X-Men, and Fantastic Four.\nIn the original Scientology video, Cruise discusses his faith and his opinion on what it means to be a Scientologist, while the theme music from his \"Mission: Impossible\" series of films plays in the background. The video, which was not intended for public distribution outside of the Church of Scientology, is nine minutes long and contains heavy use of Scientology terminology. The video appeared on YouTube January 15, two days before the release of a biography on Cruise by Andrew Morton: \"Tom Cruise: An Unauthorized Biography\". \nThe Church of Scientology sent legal letters to YouTube and to Gawker.com, sites which were hosting the Cruise video at the time, and requested that they take it down. YouTube complied, but Gawker.com did not, and Nick Denton of Gawker.com commented: \"It's newsworthy, and we will not be removing it.\" The video later appeared on websites other than Gawker.com, including the \"New York Post\", Independent Television News and the BBC. \nAttempts by the Church of Scientology to remove the video from the Internet motivated an Internet-based group known as \"Anonymous\" to take action in a movement called Project Chanology. Members of Anonymous bombarded Scientology websites and were successful in taking some of them down, including Scientology.org. Anonymous later changed tactics towards legal measures, and held international protests against Scientology on February 10 and March 15, with another international protest planned for April 12. \nAccording to Scientology critic David S. Touretzky, the Scientology terms used in the video by Cruise have \"entered the national lexicon\", and the Scientology video itself has become something of an Internet phenomenon. Touretzky also referred to the negative effect on Cruise's publicity as a consequence of the leak.\nIn the excerpt released online from \"Superhero Movie\", actor Miles Fisher imitates Cruise in what Liz Shannon Miller of \"NewTeeVee\" described as \"an eerily dead-on impersonation of Cruise\u2019s infamous leaked Scientology indoctrination video\". She also compared the clip to a different spoof of the Cruise video, by actor Jerry O'Connell. Craig Ferguson also spoofed the video in a clip on his show on CBS, \"The Late Late Show\", as did the comedy website Super Deluxe.\nChristopher McDonald plays the villain \"Hourglass\" in \"Superhero Movie\", and told \"MTV News\" he was surprised at some of the parodies that successfully appear in the film: \"The thing I didn't think we'd get away with was the actual Tom Cruise stuff. There may be lawsuits there.\"\nA post at \"Slashfilm\" wrote positively of Fisher's performance: \"Slashfilm would like to salute young actor and Harvard alum Miles Fisher for easily giving the best impression of Tom Cruise we\u2019ve ever seen in the yuk-yuk comic book spoof.\" A post at \"MoviesOnline\" commented: \"The actor hits every point he needs to and it is almost scary how close he is to the actual Tom Cruise way of thinking.\" Thomas Leupp of \"ReelzChannel.com\" called the scene \"a dead-on spoof of Tom Cruise's now-infamous Scientology video\". Ryan Parsons of \"CanMag\" wrote that Fisher impersonates Cruise \"perfectly\", and Ryan Tate of \"Gawker.com\" called the clip \"the slickest crazy-Cruise imitation yet, as well as one of the funniest\"."}

The parliamentary election is for both the House of Assembly and the Senate. In the presidential election, \"Voice of America\" has reported that analysts in Zimbabwe have predicted a victory for incumbent Robert Mugabe.\nWith the last parliamentary election having been held in 2005, the subsequent election was initially planned to be held in 2010, but after an abortive plan to delay the 2008 presidential election to 2010, it was decided to instead bring the parliamentary election forward by two years so that it could be held concurrently with the 2008 presidential election.\nThe House of Assembly is being expanded from 150 to 210 members, all elected, in the 2008 election, while the Senate is being expanded to 93 seats, 60 of which will be directly elected (six from each province). There are 29 constituencies in Harare, 28 in Midlands, 26 in Manicaland, 18 in Mashonaland Central, 23 in Mashonaland East, 22 in Mashonaland West, 26 in Masvingo, 13 in Matabeleland North, and 13 in Matabeleland South, and 12 in Bulawayo. Unlike in past elections, when constituency voter rolls were used, ward voter rolls will be used in the 2008 election. The Zimbabwe Electoral Commission delimited 1,958 wards.\nOn January 25, 2008, the specific date of the election was announced as March 29. A spokesperson for the faction of the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) led by Morgan Tsvangirai denounced this as \"an act of madness and arrogance\", while the leader of the other MDC faction, Arthur Mutambara, said that a free and fair election could not be held under the existing conditions, calling for a new constitution to be adopted prior to the election.\nPrior to the election being held, ZANU-PF has already won two seats where it was unopposed: the House of Assembly seat from Muzarabani South, won by Edward Raradza, and the Senate seat from Rushinga, won by Damien Mumvuri.\nWhile not inviting any observers from the European Union or the United States, Zimbabwe has invited 47 observer teams, including observers from the Southern African Development Community (SADC), the African Union, China, Russia, and Iran. On March 11, the arrival of the first 50 observers from SADC was reported, with more expected. SADC had already conducted a preliminary mission in February, in which its team looked at constituencies, their boundaries, and the number of candidates, and used that information to determine the number of observers that would be necessary.\nThere are about 5.6 million registered voters and there will be about 11,000 polling stations, compared to about 4,000 polling stations in the 2005 parliamentary election."}

The nearly US$300 million contract stated that bullets were coming from Hungary, but were actually decades-old, damaged and corroded bullets from China.\nOfficials from the Army Legal Services Agency notified Diveroli, via a letter, that his company is suspended from future contracting with any U.S. government agency. The letter came as part of an Army investigation since November regarding violation of the contract.\nAccording to the \"New York Times\", Diveroli signed papers back on November 25, 2007 certifying that 28 pallets of ammunition for Afghanistan had been manufactured by MFS 2000, a Hungarian company, according to a memo written by investigators.\nAEY violated the contract by breaking two clauses, one stating that the ammunition could not be acquired directly or indirectly from the People\u2019s Republic of China, which is a violation of American law. The other clause specified that it must be packaged to comply with best commercial practices for international shipment. \nAccording to the \"Times\", says the ammunition arrived in decomposing cardboard boxes which contained ammunition dating as far back as 1966. However, Army officials believe some ammunition even dates back further to 1962.\nThe Army had contracted with AEY in January 2007 to supply various types of nonstandard ammunition for use by the Afghan National Army and Afghan National Police, an Army official said on background. The company was required to purchase the ammunition and deliver it to Kabul International Airport in Afghanistan. AEY was recently awarded a delivery order amount of $48,717,553 on March 17, 2007 as part of the $298,004,398 contract.\nAlso according to the \"Times\", when purchasing the ammunition, AEY worked with middlemen and a shell company which has been placed on federal list of entities suspected of illegal arms trafficking. Also, the \"Times\" reported that, Diveroli was secretly recorded in conversation that suggested corruption on his company's purchase of 100 million aging rounds from Albania.\nBryan Whitman, The Pentagon's spokesperson told reporters that suspension of the contract was due to the violation of the origin of the ammunition and the packaging of the ammunition, not the safety and performance.\n\u201cSafety and performance has not apparently been a factor, according to our folks in Afghanistan. They have had no safety incidents reported and no reports of any ammunition that has malfunctioned associated with this particular contract,\u201d Whitman told the press.\nHe also denied that the issue happened because the Army awarded the contract to the lowest bidder and that he was not aware of AEY's qualifications to fulfill the contract.\n\u201cAs the United States government does business, they are obviously always trying to ensure they get the best value,\u201d he said. \u201cBut that does not mean that, in achieving the best value for the taxpayer, that we will accept something that is below standard for what it is we are purchasing, either.\u201d \nAccording to an Army official, the suspension of the contract will not have an impact on Afghanistan operations and other contractors are expressing interest into entering into a contract. \u201cBesides, there\u2019s no shortage of ammunition already in Afghanistan. This will have no impact,\" he said.\nMichael Diveroli, Efrain's father, who originally founded AEY as a small printing business, said of his son's career choice to CBS' Miami affiliate, WFOR, \"I would prefer he became a nice Jewish doctor or lawyer rather than an arms dealer. He's never asked for my approval on the company. He doesn't always take my advice, I don't influence him. As a father of a boy genius he's hard to control.\"\nAngelo Diveroli, Efrain's grandfather said the young man frequently accompanied him to gun shows when he was younger and became an expert at weapons. \nA friend of Diveroli said to WFOR, \"The government came here and checked him out and gave him the contract. How do you give someone, a 21 year old kid a contract like that?\"\nThe United States Army Criminal Investigation Command is continuing their investigation, according to officials."}

The day commemorates the deaths of Eduardo and Rafael Vergara, brothers who were assassinated on March 29, 1985 under the dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet.\nThe protesters, many of whom were students, reportedly threw rocks into Santiago's main street, prompting squads of riot police to spray tear gas into the crowds. Other protesters marched towards the presidential palace, but it was cordoned off and heavily guarded. Most of the 240 who were detained are expected to be released after their identities are confirmed.\nIn between skirmishes with police, some protesters handed out flyers explaining their views. They say the government has manipulated the education system to favor the rich. \"We think this neo-liberal education system that the government has introduced should be stopped,\" said Saray Acevedo of the National Popular Coordinator of Students.\nPresident Michelle Bachelet condemned the protests. \"If one wants to pay homage to the tremendous tragedy of the Vergara brothers, during a period when Chile was not democratic, the right thing to do is guarantee that democracy means being able to express yourself but without violence,\" she said. \"Democracy in Chile is solid and there is no justification for violence,\" Bachelet added.\nOther Chileans who didn't take part in the demonstrations agree with some of the protesters' views. \"There are so many problems,\" said Rodrigo N\u00fa\u00f1ez, 39. \"It is true education is expensive and marginalizes the poor. The cost of living is high. Electricity and gas prices are up. Look at how they protest in Argentina!

The conference will also be sponsored by entities like the Buenos Aires Tourism Authority and the National University of La Plata.\nThe bid was mainly organized by the members of Wikimedia Argentina, a local chapter of the Wikimedia Foundation.\nThis will be the first Wikimania celebrated in the South American continent and the first in a Spanish-speaking country.\nWikimania is an annual international conference for the editors of Wikimedia projects. The first conference was held in , Germany, on August 4-8, 2005; the second conference was held in Boston, USA, on August 4-6, 2006; the third one was held in , Taiwan, on August 3-5, 2007; this year's conference will be held on July 17-19 in Alexandria, Egypt.\nWikimedia Argentina reacts to the selection.\n\"Wikinews\" interviewed Patricio Lorente, the President of Wikimedia Argentina, on his reaction to the selection of Buenos Aires for Wikimania 2009.\nHow do you feel about the selection?\nPatricio: The whole group feels great satisfaction and an enormous responsibility. We've been working on this candidacy for over a year and the expectancy of getting the jury's support was very big.\nHow will Wikimania 2009 be different from other years?\nPatricio: The location is part of the newness: it'll be the first Wikimania celebrated in the southern hemisphere and in a Latin country. The Spanish-speaking community has had, up until now, a weak participation in the global Wikimedia community, and we think this event will help integrate us. \nSecondly, it'll be a Wikimania more integrated to the host city than previous ones: we based our bid on that, making sure that the venues are in the very heart of Buenos Aires. In addition to having a comfortable ambiance for carrying out the discussions, we want the wiki community to live the city. \nThirdly, it'll be a bilingual Wikimania. Up until now, the official language of Wikimania has been English. As part of this effort to integrate the Spanish-speaking community to the Wikimedia world we will make sure that there is simultaneous translation between Spanish and English, so that conferences are available in both languages.\nHow do you think Wikimania will affect Latin America?\nPatricio: We hope it gives new impulse to the organization of existing communities in countries in the region, developing new local chapters. We also expect important press coverage, stimulating the appearance of new Wikimedians."}

The results were posted on the doors of polling stations, and then sent to party officials by text messaging. MDC Secretary General Tendai Biti said, \"Barring a miracle, Mugabe can't win.\"\nThe official results are expected to be released Monday, but MDC officials called for them to be released sooner, fearing the government would use the delay to rig the voting. There were unconfirmed reports that military authorities were pressuring the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission to declare Mugabe the winner. \nBiti called the delay a \"constitutional threat\" to the election's outcome. \"We are very much concerned by the lack of results from [the Electoral Commission] and we suspect that the regime is at loss as to how to respond to the results which are showing that MDC is winning in most parts of the country,\" said Biti. \nGeorge Chiweshe, chairman of the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission, said the commission would not be pressured into releasing the official count early. \"We are dealing with a matter with national dimensions,\" Chiweshe said. \"Our mandate is clearly laid down in terms of the Constitution and we have tried -- actually, have followed -- that.\"\nCritics of the government had long predicted that the election would be marred by fraud. Biti accused the ruling Zanu-PF party of chasing away his party's agents from polling stations. In addition, Amnesty International and other human-rights groups have accused the government of harassing the opposition and threatening to cut off food supplies to those who didn't vote for Mugabe's party.\nEarlier, Mugabe spokesman George Charamba warned the MDC that declaring a premature victory for Tsvangirai would be tantamount to a coup d'\u00e9tat, \"and we all know how coups are handled,\" he said. \nThere are concerns that violence may erupt on Monday if both parties claim victory. The United States embassy released a statement warning American citizens in the country of a \"volatile situation\" and a \"possibility of violence across Zimbabwe\".\nIn Harare, the capital of Zimbabwe, opposition supporters took to the streets in celebration of the MDC's announcement. One voter remarked, \"The old man is gone and our suffering has ended. Let's try another leader, Morgan Tsvangirai.\" But in the suburbs of Harare, celebration was stifled by heavily armed police, who have been deployed across Zimbabwe to stop any politically-motivated violence. \nPolice commissioner Augustine Chihuri said his forces would not hesitate to use \"full force\" against political violence. He and military commander Constantine Chiwenga have vowed not to salute Tsvangirai if he wins. However, some have questioned the effectiveness of the military, citing mass troop desertions and poor funding. \"What the military says at the senior level and what happens at the ground level of the rank and file are two very different things,\" says Henri Boshoff, a military analyst."}

Primary brain tumors are a rare condition that account for 1.4 percent of all cancers and 2.4 percent of cancer deaths. The death rate from brain tumors is approximately 13,000 persons per year in the United States. Tobacco causes an estimated 438,000 deaths per year in the United States.

The gathering in Lukasa, Zambia was the first meeting of the Cluster Munition Coalition (CMC) in Africa. \n\"Africa is ready for Dublin,\" summarised Zambian delegate Robert Mtonga, referring to the upcoming May 19-30 meeting in Ireland to discuss a global ban on the weapons. \"Too often Africa's voice is pushed to the margins in international decision-making. But in banning cluster bombs worldwide, a common African voice will speak volumes and win the day\". \nMtonga was critical of South Africa, the lone voice against Monday's decision and the continent's largest producer and stockpiler of cluster bombs, and called on the country to destroy its munitions and join the coalition to outlaw their use. Egypt, the only other African nation to produce the controversial weapons, voiced support for the ban. \n\"Strong political will\" was credited with the resolution, by CMC co-ordinator Thomas Nash in recognising the drive \"to stop the proliferation of this outdated weapon\". \nIn a released statement the CMC said that 19 African countries, including South Africa, have endorsed the Wellington Declaration. The Wellington Declaration is the basis for the upcoming negotiations at the Dublin Diplomatic Conference in Ireland in May.\nWhile countries such as Germany and the United Kingdom have tabled the idea of a \"transition period\" during which time cluster bombs would remain a legitimate weapon of war, the African delegation was resolutely against the idea, calling for an immediate ban.\nCluster munitions are dropped from aircraft, opening in mid-air and releasing a large number of smaller explosives over a wide area. Writer Theodora Williams stated that their use usually results in \"...the death and maiming of thousands of innocent civilians\".\nThere are currently 13 African nations that possess cluster bombs although Uganda has recently announced they are destroying their stockpiles. The weapons have been used in eight African conflicts in the past 35 years. In addition to Ethiopia, Morocco, Nigeria and the Sudan, other nations known to have used the weapons are the former Yugoslavia, Eritrea, France, Israel, the Netherlands, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Tajikistan, the United Kingdom and the United States. \nAccording to the \"San Francisco Chronicle\", the United States, China, Russia, and Israel have resisted any ban on cluster bombs, arguing that they can be used in self-defense. The \"San Francisco Chronicle\" reported that the United States has lobbied allies to create loopholes in the upcoming Oslo treaty, to allow for the use of cluster bombs. \"Reuters\" reported that a U.S. official had stated that cluster bombs should not be banned if they are used responsibly in state conflicts.\nIn October 2007, Uganda became the first African country to state it would destroy its cluster bomb stockpiles. Uganda has announced a pan-African meeting to take place after the Dublin meeting, which would seek to garner support for the signing of a treaty in Oslo set to take place in December 2008. The weapons have been used in eight African conflicts in the past 35 years.\nThe CMC is an international network composed of over 250 civil society organizations in 60 countries, with the stated aim of protecting civilians from cluster munitions. Members of the CMC have been working to complete an international treaty to ban cluster munitions by 2008.\nAt the February CMC committee meeting in New Zealand, only 82 of the 122 nations present endorsed a draft ban on the production, usage or storage of cluster bombs."}

He was posthumously awarded a Purple Heart and Bronze Star, according to reports.\nRogers was killed by an improvised explosive device while on foot patrol in Baghdad on January 27, 2008, according to an Army report.\nRogers' funeral gained national media publicity, initially on MSNBC, in the \"Washington Post\" and on National Public Radio's (NPR) \"Morning Edition\"; however, initial reports omitted Rogers' sexual orientation or anything related to the subject.\nThe \"Post\" and \"Morning Edition\" reports coincided with the \"grim milestone\" that the US military death toll reached 4,000 dead. Rogers' death and funeral gained further media attention when it was revealed that he was gay and worked to end the military's DADT policy.\nInitially, members of the national media were well aware of Rogers' sexual orientation, and it was widely reported that Rogers was not married and left no children. While technically accurate, the omission of Rogers' sexual orientation was viewed as an intentional distortion by some members of the LGBT community.\nThe \"Washington Post\" ombudsman, Deborah Howell, wrote that the editors of the \"Post\" deliberated the question of whether to disclose his sexual orientation and ultimately made a decision not to include such information.\nThe Army asked that Rogers' sexual orientation not be disclosed, and the Army presented it as a concern of the family, according to news reports.\nThe \"Washington Blade\", a newspaper for the Washington LGBT community, reported on the \"Post\"'s decision to change the story and included more details about Rogers' activities and friends in the LGBT community.\nSubsequently, Howell of the \"Washington Post\", citing Rogers' apparent feelings on DADT, wrote a column admitting that the \"Post's\" article \u201cwould have been richer\u201d had it disclosed his sexual orientation and activities in the LGBT community. \nRogers was buried with full military honors at Arlington National Cemetery on March 14, 2008."}

The UN stated that the two men, one British and one Kenyan, were abducted at gunpoint while conducting a survey of local rivers. The men were taken hostage on a road leading to Bu'aale, in the southern Lower Jubba region of Somalia.\nBriton Murray Watson was abducted along with his Kenyan colleague, Patrick Amukhuma, by six armed militiamen who ambushed their armed convoy. The abduction took place on a main road between Saakow and Bu'aale.\nGunfire was exchanged between Somali bodyguards and militia members. According to \"Agence France-Presse\", local elders said that the gunmen fired shots during the attack and wounded one of the hostages, and \"The Daily Telegraph\" reported that witnesses said Watson was wounded in the leg. \nLocal district commissioner Ibrahim Noleye spoke with \"Agence France-Presse\" about the incident: \"two foreign aid workers from the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) were intercepted by armed militiamen on their way to Buale ...

It is unclear why this attack has taken place. We understand that Mr Watson has been hurt, but we don't know the extent of his injuries.\"\n\"Reuters\" has reported that local militias were pursuing the kidnappers in an attempt to free the hostages, and local clan elders are pressing for their release. Hajir Bille, an official from the Juba region in Somalia, told the \"Associated Press\" that security forces were looking for the abductors.\nA statement released by the UN country office for Somalia addressed reports that one of the men kidnapped had been wounded: \"Witnesses on the ground say there was gunfire when the men were taken, but there is no information to suggest that any serious injury was sustained by either man.\" \"Reuters\" has reported that the hostages are being held \"in or near\" the town of Jilib. \nUN officials in Rome, Italy said that the two men worked for an Indian-based group sub-contracted to do aerial survey work for the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), a United Nations agency. The men are not themselves members of the FAO, but are employees of Genesys International Corporation, an information technology company in Bangalore, India. \nGenesys International Corporation performs aerial surveys in Somalia which help the area population deal with flooding due to a rise in water level of the Juba and Shabelle rivers.\nWestern companies and organizations have paid ransoms to free their employees, and kidnappings in the area have increased as a result. In recent months attacks on foreigners in Somalia have increased, but had been localized to the northern region of Puntland. M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res withdrew its international staff from the country after three workers were killed by a bomb in February.\nAttacks against Somalia's weak government and its Ethiopian military backers have increased in the last six months.

Mr. Ahern made the announcement today at a press conference in Government Buildings in Dublin. Ahern's imminent resignation comes on the back of over a year of controversy surrounding payments received by him in the early 1990's while he was serving as Minister of Finance. He has been forced to give evidence on these payments to a tribunal of inquiry and his evidence there is ongoing. \nMr. Ahern has been a TD (MP) for 31 years and has been Taoiseach for the past 11 years, making him the second longest serving Irish Premier after Eamonn de Valera. He won a record 3rd term in office following the general election last year. He currently leads a coalition of his own party Fianna F\u00e1il, the Green Party, the Progressive Democrats and various independent politicians.\nAhern noted, \"Never, in all the time I've served in public life, have I put my personal interests ahead of the public good.\" Further going on to say, \"I have never received a corrupt payment, and I've never done anything to dishonor any office I have held.\" Adding, \"I know in my heart of hearts I've done no wrong and wronged no one.\"\nT\u00e1iniste (Deputy Prime Minister) and Minister of Finance Brian Cowen is expected to succeed Mr. Ahern as both Taoiseach and leader of Fianna F\u00e1il. \nReaction.\nMany Irish and British politicians have responded to decision to resign and made note of his work in Ireland's economy and the Northern Ireland peace process. \nIrish President Mary McAleese said of Ahern, \"His contributions to our thriving economy and to peace in Northern Ireland were hugely important and he deserves every credit for the work he has done.\" McAleese added, \"Bertie Ahern will be remembered as one of the outstanding politicians of his generation both nationally and internationally.\"\nIrish Labour Party leader Eamon Gilmore welcomed the decision stating, \"I came to the conclusion many months ago that Mr. Ahern would find it impossible to continue in office because of the mounting conflicts and contradictions between the statements he originally made about his financial affairs and the evidence uncovered by the Mahon tribunal.\" \nGilmore noted that Ahern made \"remarkable achievements\" during his tenure including \"huge personal and political effort\" in the Northern Ireland peace process. Finally Gilmore added, \"On a personal level, I wish Mr. Ahern well in his retirement.\"\nOpposition leader and leader of Fine Gael, Enda Kenny noted that the work of the government was being \"distracted\" by events of the Mahon tribunal and that \"set standards and principles\" for others that he has \"not applied to himself until now.\" \nKenny added, \"I know that personally this is a very sad day for the Taoiseach and I want to wish him well personally on his retirement as Taoiseach and for his future life. I have to say that this decision was inevitable. The Taoiseach here has bowed to the inevitable based on the weight of his own evidence at the tribunal.\"\nSinn F\u00e9in leader Gerry Adams noted, \"He is justifiably proud of the fact that he was the Taoiseach who was in place and who, with the British prime minister and the rest of us, brought about the Good Friday agreement and he deserves our thanks for that. And he deserves our gratitude for that I mean, it was a collective effort, but clearly as the Taoiseach of the day he is due appreciation for that.\"\nMark Durkan, the leader of the Social Democratic and Labour Party, said \"When he came to office, he inherited the peace process and the talks process and ensured that their opportunity for all the people of Ireland was maximized. His commitment to the north has been shown in his constant involvement either in implementing the Agreement or in initiatives to secure its implementation.\" He further added, \"This good work involved not just high profile, high wire negotiations, but a lot of diligent private engagement with many interests.\"\nTony Blair, former British Prime Minister said of Ahern, \"He will always be remembered for his crucial role in bringing about peace in Northern Ireland, for transforming relations between Britain and the Irish Republic and for presiding over a sustained period of economic and social advance in Ireland.\" Blair further added, \"He will have, deservedly, a central place in his nation's political history and much more widely.\" He said of Ahern, \"A remarkable man with a remarkable record of achievement.\"\nBritish Prime Minister Gordon Brown noted, \"Bertie Ahern has been an outstanding statesman, and has made an historic contribution in helping to bring peace to Northern Ireland, transforming Ireland's relationship with the UK, and playing a key role in the development of a forward looking and dynamic Europe.\" Brown added, \"The UK could not have had a better partner.\"\nScottish First Minister Alex Salmond said, His political career is one of great achievement. He was a key player in bringing about the historic Good Friday Agreement, and I am in no doubt his significant contribution to the peace efforts and devolution will be a fitting and lasting legacy for his 30 years in politics.\" \nSalmond added, \"He has never failed to impress me - as taoiseach - and in his previous and wider roles in Irish politics. The accomplishments of the Irish Celtic Tiger economy demonstrate the advantage of being a small independent nation in Europe.\""}

The attack, first reported by \"Wired News\", exploited a function of the forums to post JavaScript code. The code injected by the vandals flashed two images repeatedly and tried to lead users off to external websites showing flashing lights and shapes intended to trigger off epileptic fits. The Epilepsy Foundation had to shut down the forum, and took some measures to prevent future attacks.\nIn a press release, the Foundation stated that several users of the forum, sufferers of epilepsy, experienced harsh migraines and seizures as a result of the attack. One woman, RyAnne Fultz, was paralyzed by the flashing images in what she calls her worst attack in over a year, until her 11-year old son managed to get her to stop looking at the screen and close the flashing images.\nThey also posted a message regarding new measures saying \"In our upping of security on the forums, we have established the following new rules: No animated images are allowed to be used anywhere from now on.

The Austrian paper Krone reports that the \"usual goal of their attacks is to raise a fuss or disturb others\". Following critical reports about the attack, members of the group blamed the attack on the Church of Scientology. \n\"Wired News\" states that the attack on the forum may have been the first computer attack in history to inflict physical harm on its victims.\nBetween three and five per cent of all epilepsy sufferers are vulnerable to seizures triggered by flashing lights, shapes or colours, like ones used in the attack. Photosensitive epilepsy has been in the news increasingly over the last few years as various media have triggered seizures in people.\nRecently a logo animation for the 2012 London Olympics caused thousands of people to experience seizures. In another incident, the episode \"Denn\u014d Senshi Porygon\" of the animated TV series \"Pok\u00e9mon\" caused thousands of children to experience seizures in Japan.

Scientists suggest that climate change during the end of the Pleistocene caused their habitat to shrink in size and as a result caused Woolly mammoth populations to drop and then Paleolithic humans delivered the final blow to the woolly mammoths by hunting the remaining Woolly mammoths. The warming climate may have also assisted humans in over hunting the woolly mammoth, the global warming that occurred during the end of the Pleistocene and the beginning of the Holocene melted ice and allowed humans to gain accesses to more mammoth habitats than previously possible.\nScientists have reached this new conclusion by combining population and climate change modeling in their research which has never been attempted in the past. This new method may have made them able to retrieve clearer data regarding the extinction of the woolly mammoth from the geological record. Previously, the two methods were used separately, yielding less conclusive evidence of a human role in the extinction of the Woolly mammoth and other Pleistocene Megafauna. Additionally, recent years have seen an improvement in Paleoclimatic data, allowing scientists to draw a better conclusion from the existing data."}

For the writer, it is a way to have a greater voice and impact on other people, and other people's thinking; it's a great public service to help edit on Debatepedia, like on Wikipedia.

It was the only stop for the torch in the United States, as it makes its way around the world to Beijing, China, for the 2008 Summer Olympics.\nThe route for the torch was materially altered as protesters filled the streets along the planned route. The route, which was originally 10 kilometres long, was shortened by nearly half, according to the San Francisco Police Department. In hopes that all eighty of the scheduled torch carriers would get a chance to carry the torch, the carriers ran in pairs.\nThe first torch carrier ran as scheduled, but then carried it into a warehouse, from which a motorcycle was observed leaving. The torch was then spotted again on a major street nearly two miles off course.\nThe rerouting was carefully planned, according to San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom, who told \"Associated Press\", that it was because of \"a disproportionate concentration of people in and around the start of the relay.\"\nThe closing ceremonies were held at San Francisco International Airport instead of the planned waterfront location at AT&amp;T Park.\nMatt Helmenstine, 30, a California high school teacher carrying a Tibetan flag told Reuters: \"I think it's cowardly. If they can't run the torch through the city, it means that no one is supporting the games.\"\n\"This is a once-in-a-lifetime thing for us to see the torch,\" said Nancy Chan, a local resident, to the \"San Francisco Chronicle\". \"There is a lot of politics around it, but that is the great thing about America - the free speech.\" She and her 4-year-old son ran to the new route when it was announced.\nAt least one protester was arrested, Xiao Tan, 32, of Chinese origin, who tried to unfurl a Tibetan flag. \"I'm proud to be Chinese, but I don't like what's happening in Tibet,\" he told AFP. The \"Vancouver Sun\" reported a number of arrests, but says that violence is limited.\nPeter Ueberroth, the chairman of the United States Olympic Committee, said that the right balance had been reached, between preserving freedom of speech for protesters, while still providing an exhilarating experience for torchbearers, as well as preventing a repeat of the chaotic demonstrations that accompanied the torch in London and Paris.\nAlready Tuesday evening, hundreds paraded with Tibetan flags while chanting \"Shame on China\". On Monday, protesters hung banners from the Golden Gate Bridge. As the torch went to London and Paris, the torch relay was subject to large scale protests in both cities.\nTight security was planned in advance. Airspace restrictions have been put in place and over 700 security personnel are expected to be deployed including FBI agents. Police leave was cancelled. The United States Coast Guard patrolled the part of the route that was to take the torch along the waterfront at Fisherman's Wharf.\n\"We are trying to accomplish two goals here. One is to protect the right to free speech and the other is to ensure public safety, and here in San Francisco we are good at both of those things,\" said Nathan Ballard about the security. Ballard is a spokesperson for San Francisco Mayor's office.\n\"I am saddened that such a beautiful symbol of the torch, which unites people of different religions, different ethnic origin, different political systems, cultures and languages, has been attacked,\" said Jacques Rogge, the president of the International Olympic Committee, to the \"Wall Street Journal\".\nThe Beijing Organizing Committee said in a statement on Monday: \"We strongly condemn the actions of the few 'pro-Tibet independence' activists who have attempted to sabotage the Olympic Torch Relay. The Olympic flame belongs to the world and these actions are a serious violation of the Olympic spirit. They are bound to fail and will surely arouse the resentment of peace-loving people who support the Olympic Games.\""}

It wasn't that we haven't been selling eggs and ketchup to youths, but have been careful about who we have sold them to, and we are glad it has been making a difference.\""}

The \"2007 Internet Crime Report\" was released in April by the Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3), a joint operation between the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the National White Collar Crime Center. \nAmericans reported losses of US$240 million from global cyber-crime in 2007, a $40 million increase from 2006. The Internet Crime Complaint Center received 206,884 complaints of online fraud in 2007, a decrease from the previous year's 207,492 complaints. \nFBI special agent John Hambrick, in charge of the IC3 unit, told the \"Agence France-Presse\" \"We're seeing more schemes involving bigger ticket items, get-rich-quick and work-at-home schemes that involve higher dollar losses\". As the report only includes figures from crimes reported to law enforcement, it is likely that real crime numbers were higher.\nFBI Cyber Division Assistant Director James E. Finch commented on the report: \"The Internet presents a wealth of opportunity for would be criminals to prey on unsuspecting victims, and this report shows how extensive these types of crime have become ... What this report does not show is how often this type of activity goes unreported. Filing a complaint through IC3 is the best way to alert law enforcement authorities of Internet crime.\"\nIn response to the report's release, the information technology consultancy Global Secure Systems (GSS) warned that the United Kingdom is becoming a hotbed of internet crime. According to the report, the UK accounts for 15.3 per cent of online crime from US crime reports. \"This is significantly ahead of other cyber-crime hotspots such as Nigeria (5.7 per cent) and Romania (1.5 per cent),\" said David Hobson, managing director of GSS, in an interview with \"vnunet.com\".\nThe \"2007 Internet Crime Report\" cites the top ten countries by amount of perpetrators of online crime. In descending order, the top ten list includes the United States, the United Kingdom, Nigeria, Canada, Romania, Italy, Spain, South Africa, Russia, and Ghana. Scammers living within the United States most often lived in California, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, New York, Pennsylvania, and Texas. Men lost more money to online fraud than women in 2007, and also accounted for 75 percent of cyber-crime perpetrators.\nFBI spokeswoman Cathy Milhoan told \"CIO Today\" that online scammers attempt to take advantage of the good will of individuals, asking for money for purported charities during crises. \"The scammer tries to prey on victims who are kind of in tune with what's going on in the world. The scam changes, but ultimately they're preying on the good will of people,\" said Milhoan.\nThe most widely reported complaint was Internet auction fraud at 35.7 per cent of referred crime complaints. Other online criminal activities cited in the report include non-delivery of purchases and credit/debit card fraud, computer intrusions, spam/unsolicited e-mail, and child pornography. The report also seeks to raise awareness of other types of cyber-crimes, and describes steps individuals can take both to prevent internet crime, and to report it if they have been victimized."}

Featured articles (FAs) meet Wikipedia's highest standards for quality, accuracy, neutrality, completeness, and style, and thus are considered the best articles on Wikipedia. \nThe Wikipedia team that carries out the assessment and quality control before conferring the status of featured articles promoted five articles to FA status at the same time: \"Walter de Coventre\", \"Maximian\", \"El Se\u00f1or Presidente\", \"Lord of the Universe\", and \"Red-billed Chough\". With five promoted at the same time, conferring the status of 2,000th on one is an arbitrary decision and in some respects any of these articles could actually make a claim to the honour.\nThe article \"El Se\u00f1or Presidente\" was created and developed by a University of British Columbia class, \"Murder, Madness, and Mayhem: Latin American Literature in Translation\". While an important milestone, the 2,000th featured article is also symbolic of Wikipedia's growing role in the 21st century learning arena. \nThe professor of the class, Jon Beasley-Murray, began using Wikipedia as a collaborative space where his students could both do coursework and provide a type of virtual public service. Thus, he created a Wikipedia project, \"Murder Madness and Mayhem\", that focussed on creating articles relating to the Latin American literature covered in his class. Not surprisingly, \"El Se\u00f1or Presidente\" is considered one of the most important books in Latin American literature, written by Nobel Prize-winning Guatemalan writer, Miguel \u00c1ngel Asturias. \nThe Wikinews team contacted Prof. Beasley-Murray, who agreed to be interviewed for this story. His responses can be found below. Included are sections soliciting responses from three students who took the class and helped create and bring \"El Se\u00f1or Presidente\" to Feature Article status. Thus far the project has created seven good articles in addition to the 2,000th featured article.\nMurder Madness and Mayhem.\n Professor Beasley-Murray, thank you for giving us some of your valuable time and agreeing to talk to us. Can you give some background on what prompted you to start this project?\n Did you consult with fellow academics or students prior to launching this project?\n I would assume the Wikipedia community was in favour of your project, did anyone outwith that community make notably critical comments about your idea?\n How significant a percentage of the mark you were giving for the class came from Wikipedia contributions?\n As a member of the Wikimedia Foundation's communications committee I (Brian McNeil) frequently see both sides of the conflict over how relevant or reliable Wikipedia is. This ranges from queries coming in from students working on their school paper who want a response to their librarian and teachers effectively banning use of Wikipedia, to the other extreme such as a recent case where a teaching surgeon in the UK asking for permission to quote extensively from Wikipedia for a paper on the site's relevance and potential use for undergraduates in medicine. I have a stock answer detailing how to check Wikipedia sources; that Wikipedia is a great starting point for research, and that if you disallow Wikipedia you should disallow Britannica. Is this something you would agree with?\n Was the experience of using a wiki for collaboration something you would repeat? There have been suggestions for something you might call \"EduWiki\" for the collaborative development of course material. Would you get involved with something like that? Do you see potential for use of the MediaWiki software in other areas of education? Such a project could be hosted under Wikimedia Foundation projects such as Wikibooks or Wikiversity. Would you favour that over a closed project within academia where contributors' credentials could be verified?\n Would you describe your students as receptive to the idea of doing coursework where the general public could view their works in progress?\n Did any students fail to fit in and find themselves unable to work with Wikipedia?\n Do you feel that doing this part of the course in such a radically open way encouraged any of the students to work to a higher standard than the might otherwise have?\n In reflecting on the project, is there anything you would have done differently?\n You've hit about 6,000 edits personally, have you caught the \"wiki bug\"? Will you keep editing?\n In light of the apparent success of your project what would you say to other academics to try and persuade them to try similar experiments?\n Before moving on to bringing your students into the discussion, I'd like to close with your thoughts on making this a regular part of the curriculum. Do you intend to do so? Do you feel other institutions should examine your project with a view to emulating it?\nGood and Featured Articles.\n In addition to the one featured article, seven made \"Good Article\" status. How much of an encouragement was that to those of you involved in the project?\n How long were you involved with Wikipedia before you really felt Good or Featured was achievable?\n If you could improve the guidelines for people wanting to take articles up to Featured status, what would you change?\n Do you feel that having anything you did immediately viewable by anyone on the Internet encouraged you to aim for a higher standard than you might have with a more conventional paper that only the professor would see?\n Do you believe that contributing something to a 'digital commons' gives you more of a sense of achievement than just turning in a term paper?\n Have you caught the \"wiki bug\"? Will you keep editing?\n Assuming Professor Beasley-Murray repeats this project in subsequent years, what advice would you give to students following in your footsteps and starting on Wikipedia?\n Which would you describe as the harder 'marking authority'? Other professors where you've submitted conventional term papers, or the teams assessing Wikipedia contributions with a view to awarding Good or Featured status?\n Was there significant input from other Wikipedians not taking your course? If so, was this valuable?\n As a fairly open-ended question, would you see any use for wiki technology in any of your other study areas, or even where you may hope to eventually end up in employment?\nThe 2,000th.\n How did you feel when \"El Se\u00f1or Presidente\" was made up to Featured Article (FA) status? Did you have a celebratory drink or a party?\n Were you disappointed that more of your articles didn't make FA status?\n Was getting the article up to that status harder than you expected?\n Does the lack of credit on Wikipedia concern you?\n Academia is often characterised as \"publish or die\". Do you believe the educational establishment should embrace Wikipedia or wiki technology as a way of making this publishing requirement less onerous?\n How has working on getting something to FA status changed your opinion of Wikipedia from that you held prior to the start of this project?\n I'd like to thank you all for taking the time out of your busy schedules to help on this Wikinews article. Who knows? It too could end up featured."}

Over 1,200 cases have been reported in the provinces of Nyanza, Rift Valley, North Eastern and Western. According to \"Agence France-Presse\", officials have reported 45 people dead in Nyanza Province, 12 in North Eastern Province and seven in Rift Valley Province. Health officials have stated that the actual number of deaths due to the outbreak could be higher due to under reporting. \nSK Sharif, senior deputy director of health services in Nyanza, commented on contributing factors to the outbreak: \"The mass movement of people during the post-election crisis may also have contributed to the outbreak of the disease as people found themselves in areas with inadequate water and sanitation facilities\".\nHealth workers are working to contain the outbreak, and are focusing efforts on areas affected by violence related to the December elections. Suba, Migori, Homabay, Rongo, Siaya, Kisumu, Bondo, Nyando, Kisii, Wajir, Mandera, Naivasha, Nakuru and Bunyala are among the worst affected districts.\nThe possibility of a disease outbreak in Kenya was previously raised by health officials, specifically in camps where hundreds of thousands of displaced people reside. Revenge killings, tribal fighting and upheaval following the December elections in Kenya has displaced many in the country. \nTitus Mung'ou, spokesman for Kenya Red Cross Society, told \"Agence France-Presse\" \"We are trying to reduce the prevalence of the mix up that may happen by scrutinising food donations that are brought in the camps, but mostly we are ensuring that all the water is well treated\".\nIn a news conference Thursday in Nairobi, Director of Medical Service Dr. James Nyikal said that if urgent measures were not undertaken to control the outbreak, it could become much worse. \"Most deaths occurred at home or on the way to hospital,\" said Dr. Nyikal.

Already some staff have been dispatched\". Dr. Nyikal voiced concerns over high risk areas: \"We are particularly concerned by risk areas such as eating premises and bus stops in major towns such as Busia, Kisumu, Kericho, Nakuru, Naivasha, Nairobi, Voi, Mtito Andei and Mombasa\".\nWorld Health Organization Country Director Dr. David Okello emphasized the importance of hygiene, stating: \"We need to emphasise the importance of water safety and the public needs to adopt the measures of keeping water safe.\" Dr. Okello stressed that \"Boiling drinking water or treating water with chlorine and practising good toilet manners are necessary to avoid contamination\". \nCholera is a waterborne disease and causes serious diarrhea and vomiting. The disease can be fatal if it is not treated within 24 hours. Spread of the disease can be prevented by avoiding contaminated drinking water, and practicing proper hand washing before touching food.

Carme Chac\u00f3n, formerly the housing minister, was appointed as Spain's first female defense minister. \n\"It is the first government in which a woman has the defence portfolio and the first government in which there are more women than men,\" Zapatero said. \"I feel very proud that there are more women ministers than men.\" Mar\u00eda Teresa Fern\u00e1ndez de la Vega, who became Spain's first female deputy prime minister in 2004, was reappointed to her position. \nTwo new ministries will now be a part of the cabinet. Bibiana A\u00eddo was named head of the new Equality Ministry. At 31 years old, she is the youngest minister in Spain's history. Molecular biologist Cristina Garmendia will head the new Science and Innovation Ministry.\nZapatero hopes the new cabinet will work to boost the nation's economy, which he says will be one of his top priorities as prime minister. \"We must continue to boost the economy and do it in a new way, less dependent on construction,\" Zapatero said. Miguel Sebasti\u00e1n, Zapatero's former chief economic advisor, was named the new industry minister.\nForeign minister Miguel \u00c1ngel Moratinos, economy minister Pedro Solbes, interior minister Alfredo P\u00e9rez Rubalcaba, and justice minister Mariano Fernandez Bermejo all kept their posts, while four other ministers were ousted."}

Refugees have been living in the camp as a result of the conflict in the Darfur region of Sudan.\nThe fire started in the Goz Amer camp triggered by a cooking fire that had gone unwatched. The fire moved quickly through the camp due to high winds. Many of the refugees lost all of their belongings and food rations in the blaze. After receiving tents from the UNHCR in 2004, many of the refugees built traditional dwellings out of sticks and mud, and these shelters burned rapidly in the fire.\nIn a UNHCR press release, Emmanuel Uwurukundo, acting UNHCR head in Koukou-Angarana said: \"Everybody around, refugees and all our partners alike, rushed to the spot and tried to extinguish the fire with whatever they had: clothes, extinguishers and water. The teamwork was outstanding.\"\nIn Geneva the UN High Commissioner for Refugees Ant\u00f3nio Guterres commented on the situation: \"The refugees have already suffered so much tragedy and now face yet another trauma. I am deeply relieved that there was no loss of life in this devastating fire. We will do everything we can to help and to get shelter and food supplies to them as quickly as possible.\"\nFamilies affected by the fire were housed at three area schools, and the UNHCR announced on Friday that it planned to deliver aid supplies including sleeping mats, blankets and kitchen sets. The World Food Programme was also asked by the UNHCR for an extra monthly food ration to be delivered to the families whose homes were destroyed in the blaze.\nThe Goz Amer camp houses about 20,500 refugees, and is located approximately 70 kilometers from the Sudanese border. Goz Amer is one of 12 UNHCR-run camps along the Chad-Sudan which all told contain over 240,000 refugees from Darfur.\nChad and Sudan signed a peace agreement on March 13 in an attempt to end a five-year conflict, and the leaders of both countries agreed not to back rebel groups that are active near their borders.\nApproximately 2.2 million people from the Darfur region have left their homes since the beginning of the violence in 2003. The UN puts the number of deaths due to the Darfur conflict at over 200,000, and the Sudanese government has said that only 9,000 have died. "}

Wheeler is most known in the popular culture for popularizing the term \"black hole\" to describe stars which had become so dense that nothing, not even light, could escape their gravitational pull. Although Wheeler initially objected to the idea, he later accepted the idea and coined the term \"black hole\" to describe such objects.\nWheeler was also known for his work along with Richard Feynman and others in the Manhattan Project, which produced the first nuclear fission bomb. He was later involved in the work to build the first fusion bomb. As much as he was known for his research, Wheeler was known for his skill and accomplishment in teaching. \nWheeler was born July 9, 1911, in Jacksonville, Florida and went on to earn his doctorate in physics at the early age of 21. He then went on to work in Copenhagen with Niels Bohr and later returned to the United States to become part of the Manhattan Project during World War II.\nWheeler continued to work in physics after the war and was involved in the United States Matterhorn project to build a hydrogen bomb before the Soviet Union. His politics were more militaristic than many of his fellow scientists at the time, in that he supported the Vietnam War and the building of the hydrogen bomb.\nFor a long time Wheeler was at Princeton University as the doctoral adviser for many prominent physicists including Kip Thorne and Nobel Prize winner Richard Feynman. Wheeler went on to the University of Texas at Austin in 1976 when Princeton's mandatory retirement age neared.\nWheeler continued to work until near his death. Physicists both young and old have paid tribute to Wheeler; cosmologist Max Tegmark told the New York Times that Wheeler had been \"the only physics superhero still standing\". \nHe is survived by three children, along with grandchildren and great-grandchildren."}

Lift-off occurred at 20:12:00 UTC. It is the first commercial launch of an Atlas rocket since responsibility for the launches was transferred from International Launch Services to United Launch Alliance, through Lockheed Martin. Launch was completely successful, with the spacecraft separating from its carrier rocket about half an hour after launch.\nThe Atlas V flew in the 421 configuration, with a 4 metre wide payload fairing, twin solid rocket boosters, and a single-engined Centaur upper stage. It was the 14th flight of the Atlas V, and successfully placed the satellite into a geosynchronous orbit. The launch was dedicated to former Atlas programme employee Lynn Deckard.\nICO G1 will provide S band mobile communications for satellite phones. Its launch had been delayed from May last year, owing to delays with US government missions which were launching on Atlas, and then in light of the failure of a previous Atlas launch in June. It was constructed by Space Systems/Loral, and is based on the LS-1300 satellite bus. It is the heaviest satellite to be launched by an Atlas rocket, and the heaviest single commercial satellite to be launched into a geosynchronous transfer orbit.\nSpeaking after the launch, Jim Sponnik, the Vice President of the Atlas programme told the team who had conducted the launch that they \"all did extremely well and the rocket did exceptionally well\". Colonel Scott Henderson, of the 45th Space Wing, United States Air Force, said that the launch was \"a great success\", and the result of \"phenomenal effort\" on the part of those involved. David Malcom, the President of Lockheed Martin Commercial Space Systems described the launch as a \"hole in one\". Tim Bryan, the CEO of ICO Satellite Management told the United Launch Alliance team that he \"can't express...what every person in this room has done for our business\". He also thanked Bob Day, and ICO's space team, for their work in the build up to the launch. Michael Gass, the CEO of United Launch Alliance said that the successful launch was a \"testimony to this entire team\", and told flight controllers \"congratulations, you're the best\".\nThe satellite's signal was acquired by ground tracking stations in Australia at 21:17, and the launch was confirmed to be accurate to within one nautical mile of the targeted orbit. The next Atlas launch is scheduled to occur in early July, with a DMSP weather satellite, from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California."}

Ehud Olmert, the Prime Minister of Israel did not receive Carter."}

The pair met at Stanford University in the 1930s and worked together until Thomas' death. They retired from animation in 1978, but remained popular speakers and authors about Disney and animation.\n\"Ollie was part of an amazing generation of artists, one of the real pioneers of our art, one of the major participants in the blossoming of animation into the art form we know today,\" said Roy E. Disney.\nJohnston devoted much of his retirement to writing and lecturing, but perhaps even more to model trains, a field in which he became considered one of the world's foremost experts.\nOllie Johnston's last film was \"The Fox and the Hound\" (1981) on which he worked as a supervisor."}

The serum, a treatment for leprosy, had severe adverse effects. According to Mills, \"it made our people very, very ill ... the treatment almost killed them\".\nMills' claim, aimed at highlighting the difficulty experienced by Aboriginal people in accessing records, has had the effect of \"throwing the cat among the pigeons\", and Mills has asked for the Government's assistance in \"opening Pandora's box\" with regards to records she says will be found in departmental archives. The Minister for Health, Nicola Roxon, has called on her staff to search for any relevant documents. \"These are obviously very serious allegations,\" Roxon said.\nThe term \"Stolen Generations\" refers to a government practice in the 20th century where Aboriginal and half-caste children were removed from their families and raised in institutions such as the Kahlin Compound, or in foster families. Awareness of the practice was raised in the 1997 report \"Bringing Them Home\", which recommended the Government offer recompense to victims of the act and issue a formal apology. The Prime Minister at the time, John Howard, issued a statement of regret but refused to offer an apology. In February 2008, Prime Minister Kevin Rudd issued the apology, which was accepted unanimously by Parliament, and the Stolen Generations Fund and Senate inquiry were established to process claims for compensation."}

The family blames the Church of Scientology for her death and decided to go public with the story, after the test results and a suicide note were discovered after Ballo's death.\nOn March 28, 2008, Ballo, a student at the University of Nice Sophia Antipolis located in Nice, France, took the Scientology personality test. A few hours later she reportedly killed herself by jumping from the window of her dormitory. Her friends and roommates claim she was in good spirits and showed no signs of a mental break down or depression prior to taking the test. The test was stamped and dated by the Church just hours prior to her suicide.\n\"I believe Kaja would have been alive today if she had not gone to the Scientologists,\" says friend and fellow student Henrik M\u00f8inichen, 19, to \"Dagbladet\".\n\"The information about the Scientology test has been made public through the priest's speech at the memorial service. I can confirm that. Due to the recency of her death, I don't wish to elaborate on or comment on other matters now,\" said Olav in a statement to the press.\nThe Church, which is located only meters from Ballo's dormitory, states that the results had shown Ballo was \"depressed, irresponsible, hyper-critical and lacking in harmony.\" They also state that it is \"unfair to blame Scientology\" for Ballo's death and that the test had nothing to do with it. Ballo left behind a note telling her family she was sorry for not \"being good for anything.\"\nThe incident has generated criticism against the Church from friends, family members and politicians. Inga Marte Thorkildsen, one of the members of Norway's Parliament, told the Oslo newspaper \"Dagbladet\" that \"All indications are that the Scientologist sect has played a direct role in Kaja's choice to take her own life.\"\nMatthias Fosse, information chief for the Church of Scientology in Norway, rejected any links connection between Scientology and Ballo's suicide, and denied that the personality test was \"dangerous\", saying that millions of people have taken it. The Church of Scientology also pointed out Ballo's history of psychological issues and an eating disorder that she had experienced in her early teenage years.\nThe Church has since removed the test from its Norwegian website."}

In an unprecedented gesture, he was greeted by President George W. Bush, Laura Bush and their daughter Jenna, upon his arrival at Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland.\nToday, which is also the Pope's 81st birthday, Benedict XVI visited the White House and more than 9,000 people with tickets were there to see him speak. This makes it \"one of the largest arrival ceremonies ever held at the White House,\" according to White House Press Secretary Dana Perino. An estimated additional 4,000 people without tickets lined the streets.\nThe Pope was given a 21-gun salute and greeted by President Bush on the South Lawn of the White House. Benedict XVI addressed the crowd in a short speech. He appealed for support \"for the patient efforts of international diplomacy to resolve conflicts and promote progress.\"\nHe further said, \"As the nation faces the increasingly complex political and ethical issues of our time, I am confident that the American people will find in their religious beliefs a precious source of insight and an inspiration to pursue reasoned, responsible and respectful dialogue in the effort to build a more humane and free society.\" Benedict said he has \"great respect for this vast pluralistic society\" and ended his speech with \"God bless America.\"\nKevin Waymel, 26, travelled from San Francisco with 80 others to see the Pope. He told \"The Guardian\" that he had \"come to show support for the Holy Father,\" and credited his faith for getting him off drugs.\nAfterwards, inside the White House, the first couple presented the Pope with a birthday cake. In a private meeting with Bush, Benedict XVI brought up his concerns about the Iraq war and the treatment of illegal immigrants in the United States, who may number as many as 20 million. Most of these are from Latin America and therefore overwhelmingly Catholic.\nAfter the meeting, Benedict XVI rode along Pennsylvania Avenue in the popemobile with throngs of people lining the street.\nWednesday evening, the Pope met with US bishops at the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception. He addressed the bishops about sexual abuse by the clergy, which the Pope has said made him \"deeply ashamed.\" The US Catholic Church has paid out an estimated US$2 billion to settle abuse cases in recent years.\nBendict XVI told the gathered bishops that the sex abuse scandal had at times been mishandled and urged them to reach out to the victims.\n\"It is your God-given responsibility as pastors to bind up the wounds caused by every breach of trust to foster healing, to promote reconciliation and to reach out with loving concern to those so seriously wronged,\" the Pope said.\nSome victims had hoped the Pope would have critcised bishops for transferring pedophile priests from parish to parish. He did not go that far and instead praised training programs for priests and lay people who deal with children. \"In this regard your efforts to heal and protect are bearing great fruit not only for those directly under your pastoral care, but for all of society,\" said Benedict XVI.\n\"It's the closest the Pope has come to saying that the bishops didn't do their job right. I think that's quite significant,\" said the Reverend Thomas J. Reese, a Jesuit priest and author.\nPrior to his arrival, hundreds of people were already gathered outside the Basilica as Benedict XVI arrived. \"I'm really excited,\" said an unnamed onlooker to NY1. \"It's like a dream, almost. There are, like, other foreign dignitaries, and then there's the pope. It's a unique experience and I can't wait to see him.\"\nDuring his flight to the United States, Benedict XVI told reporters that he intended to discuss poverty and development aid to poor countries with President Bush. \"The United States has to help these countries develop. It is in the interest of everyone, not only these countries but of the world and particularly of the United States,\" he said.\nThis is the first Papal visit to the United States by Benedict XVI, and the first visit of a Pope to the U.S. since John Paul II's visit in 1999. The pope scheduled to stay in Washington through Thursday. After that, he will travel to New York City where he plans to address the United Nations, visit the World Trade Center site, and celebrate Mass at Yankee Stadium."}

There was that solo stuff, and then I started writing plays in the late seventies.\" Although his work has spanned genres, most readers will recognize Bogosian for his acting, which has included a memorable performance in Woody Allen's \"Deconstructing Harry\" to co-writing and starring in the Oliver Stone movie \"Talk Radio\" (based upon his Pulitzer Prize-nominated play) to playing the bad guy in \"Under Siege 2\" to his current role in \"Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent\" as Captain Danny Ross. They may not know, however, that he had collaborated with Frank Zappa on a album, worked with Sonic Youth, and was a voice on Mike Judge's \"Beavis &amp; Butthead Do America\". He started one of New York City's largest dance companies, The Kitchen, which is still in existence. He starred alongside Val Kilmer in \"Wonderland\" and his play \"Talk Radio\" was recently revived on Broadway with Liev Schreiber in the role Bogosian wrote and made famous. \nCurrently at work on his third novel, tentatively titled \"The Artist\", Bogosian spoke with about the craft of writing and his life as a creative.\nBogosian's view of his work.\nDavid Shankbone: Which role are you most proud of?\nDS: What kind of roles do you typically go for?\nDS: And it's Woody Allen.\nDS: If you could only choose one of these careers, what would you most want to go with?\nHow Bogosian approaches his writing.\nDS: When you tackled your first novel, was there ever a time when you were like, 'I don't even know how people get an entire novel out of their heads,' and you had to actually sit down and plot it? How did you approach your first novel?\nDS: I saw that.\nDS: Do you have an audience in mind when you write?\nDS: Do you think the audience is shrinking for that sort of narrative?\nDS: How do you break your novel out? How do you get it to stand apart? \nDS: Or if you have a particular point that you want to make. Some sort of allegory or some sort of commentary on society.\nHow Bogosian works himself into his writing.\nDS: Would you describe yourself as an experience junkie?\nDS: Yeah.\nDS: Would you say it comes from emotion and character?\nDS: Do you draw any inspiration from the current political climate, either in the country or in the world?\nDS: Do you think narrative is one of the more challenging aspects of writing?\nDS: Do you ever ask yourself that question about your writing? \nDS: But do you ever ask yourself that question when you're writing, \"Who cares?\"\nThe future of the narrative.\nDS: When you look at the arc of American culture, in your experience, where do you see it heading?\nDS: Something that's not apparent.\n\"'DS: I interviewed a novelist named John Reed, who wrote this book called \"Snowball's Chance\" that was kind of a rip on Orwell. We were talking about how limited the current narrative is--at least in the United States, where it's sin, suffer and redemption. John said he could foresee at some point these multidimensional narratives almost on a Biblical level come to fruition. Where you have various dimensions, and where it goes from the Internet to magazines to television and it ends up spanning different mediums. It's an interesting idea, and when you really think about it you can see it starting to happen. It's not being done quite yet, but you could envision it.\nDS: But update it.\nDS: --that this narrative is currently not popular.\nDS: Nobody wants to find out why a person's troubled anymore?\nDS: They just want to see what the effects are and how things resolve?\nDS: Which are critically acclaimed but not commercially successful.\n\"'DS: [\"Laughs\"]\nDS: Well, it's been seen so many times that everyone knows where it's going; it gets to the point where you're like, okay, what is this? \"Dejected Man\"? Is this, \"World Didn't Turn Out The Way You Thought It Would Man\"? \nDS: In the end, the stories become uninteresting because you know it's going to be either a, b, c, or d that makes the conflict. Which is it going to be? People tend to like to read things because they want their interest grabbed. They don't want to read a book like when they watch a horror movie, knowing what is right around the corner.\nDS: How is that person going to die? You know they're going to die. Are they going to be slashed across the throat? are they going to have a sword plunging through their stomach? are they going to be shot in the face?\nDS: You know when you watch a horror movie the person's going to die; it's just a question of how.\nDS: When you take that to a literary level, it starts becoming too formulaic, and people don't care how.\nDS: Yeah.\n\"'DS: \"30 Days of Night\" is a good example of that, too, where you did have a central character, but you didn't really go into the psychology of anything. It was based on a graphic novel. It's vampires in Barrow, Alaska. You don't go into the vampires at all.\nDS: One of the criticisms that somebody told me was that they really didn't go into the vampires. You had these creatures show up; they wanted to kill. They were interesting, but you didn't go into what motivated them--it became more about survival. You had all of these different scenarios and how people's lives affected how they reacted to this sudden threat that had entered their town.\nDS: It was sort kind of a pinwheel narrative, but you didn't get into, \"What's driving them? What can stop them?\"\nCollaborations with Steven Spielberg and Frank Zappa.\nDS: What is something you notice missing from your Wikipedia article?\nDS: What's it called?\nDS: How do you come across these projects? \nDS: When you say, \"were a more interesting person,\" who was that person?\nDS: It's not as much of a collaboration as it is you're working on their project?"}

State-owned flag carrier Garuda Indonesia had hoped to begin flights to Europe imminently and has ordered ten new jetliners to serve routes there and to the United States.\nTransport ministry spokesperson Bambang Ervan said \"This seems like an unfair punishment for Indonesia. The EU is not a sovereign country and is not a member of the ICAO (International Civil Aviation Organisation). But we do respect the EU and its decision, and demand the same from the EU.\"\nThe ban was imposed after a string of accidents, of which the three most important were Adam Air Flight 574, a 102-fatality accident in which a Boeing 737-43Q plunged into the ocean after pilots distracted by instrument failure failed to maintain control, Adam Air Flight 172, in which another B737 snapped in half after a hard landing and Garuda Indonesia Flight 200, in which a third B737 attempted landing at extreme speed and overshot the runway, killing 21.\nAdam Air had also almost suffered a B737 crash the previous year, 2006, after a similar navigational instrument failure to that on Flight 574 caused the airliner to become lost for several hours, eventually performing an emergency landing hundreds of kilometres from its intended destination. Indonesia grounded the carrier in March after another accident in which a B737 overshot a runway. The carrier is also in severe financial difficulties and may soon be permanently shut down.\nMeanwhile, the pilot of Garuda 200 has been charged over the accident, sparking intense controversy.\nThe EU reviewed the ban this week, but ruled that those responsible \"have still to demonstrate that they have completed the corrective actions\" needed to lift the ban. It is a blow to Indonesia, who had promised \"fast-track\" help to Garuda, Mandala Airlines, Premiair and Airfast to raise their safety to levels acceptable to the EU.\nSources.\n "}

The YouTube accounts of both Tory Christman and Mark Bunker were suspended this week. In a statement to \"Wikinews\", YouTube explained why accounts are suspended, but did not specifically state why these particular accounts were suspended. Neither Christman nor Bunker received a notice or explanation from YouTube as to why their accounts were suspended.\nOn Tuesday April 15, Tory Christman a former Scientologist and volunteer for their Office of Special Affairs, and known as \"ToryMagoo44\" on YouTube, had her account suspended for unknown reasons. On Wednesday, after complaints to YouTube from other YouTube users and from members of the group Anonymous, Christman's account was restored.\n\"Wikinews\" confirmed Friday that Mark Bunker known as 'xenutv1' on \"YouTube\", a television and critic of Scientology, had his user account suspended. This is the second time that Bunker's account was suspended. He was formerly known as 'xenutv' when his account was suspended the first time.\n\"I want to see the complaint and on what grounds did YouTube suspend my account. I have done nothing on that account that would violate any of their terms and my videos and account should not have been pulled. The only caveat to this is my first account \"XenuTV\" was suspended a while back for a Stephen Colbert video I had from Comedy Central. At that time I created XenuTV1 and according to YouTube's terms you can only have one account. Any time I have ever been asked to remove something that may violate their terms for copyright materials, I comply immediately. It would be wrong and a misuse of power to pull my account because of this lone loophole in their terms,\" said Bunker exclusively to \"Wikinews.\"\nBunker, who is also the owner of the anti-Scientology website www.xenutv.com, has become known as \"Wise Beard Man\" to Anonymous. He was interviewed by \"Wikinews\" in February. Bunker started XenuTV in 1999 and began to make videos that he provided for the Lisa McPherson Trust. Bunker has been a critic of the Church of Scientology since 1997.\nIn 2006, he won a Regional Emmy Award after he and KUSI-TV news reporter Lena Lewis produced a documentary news video on the issues with the United States - Mexico border with San Diego, California.\nWith permission from Christman, Bunker responded to his account's suspension with a video post to her YouTube channel on Thursday. Bunker stated: \"This afternoon at 2:41, I found out YouTube canceled my account. No justification was given to me, I got no notice from them, and there appears to be no recourse. And why did this happen? Because the Jason Beghe interview was about to be posted - and Scientology did not want anyone to see that. My tease for the Jason Beghe interview went up on Sunday, and by this afternoon we had almost six hundred thousand views, and it had been profiled in newscasts around the world. There is a lot of tension being drawn to this video, and Scientology wanted to stop it.\"\nJason Beghe is a television and film actor who joined Scientology in 1994. He gave USD1 million to the Church of Scientology over the years, and told Roger Friedman of \"FOX News\" that Scientology head David Miscavige called him \"the poster boy for Scientology\". Beghe appeared in promotional videos for Scientology in 2005. In April 2008 he left Scientology, and contacted Andreas Heldal-Lund, who put him in touch with Mark Bunker. Bunker arranged an interview with Beghe, which was uploaded to Bunker's YouTube account on April 7. The posted video is a 3-minute portion of a larger 3-hour interview with Beghe about his criticism of Scientology. In the video Beghe states: \"Scientology is destructive and a rip-off. ... It\u2019s very, very dangerous for your spiritual, psychological, mental, emotional health and evolution. \"\nIn an interview with \"Wikinews\", Tory Christman commented on the suspension of her account, and now Bunker's: \"Well having worked for the Office of Special Affairs which is part of the Church of Scientology, they used to have me go out and open up phony accounts, I didn't know they were stopping free speech on the net but once I realized that ... I said 'I can't do this, I didn't get into Scientology to stop free speech'. ... I'm pretty sure, you know, I'm quite sure, that it's Scientology. That's what they do, that's their view is just 'shut em down' they have no morals on it or anything. They just figure 'screw em, shut em down'.\"\nChristman said she found out her YouTube account had been suspended on Tuesday: \"I came back from lunch at four and Mark called me and said 'Do you know your account is suspended?', and by the morning of yesterday it was back up.\"\nWhen asked if she had received a notice about the suspension from YouTube, Christman responded: \"I never got anything, and I've looked through everything, I never got any kind of a notice, either way. ... I never heard from YouTube either way - suspending it, or putting it back. And I've written them, and it was only put back thanks to Anonymous and all the critics and people that wrote in to them, I'm quite sure - Because tons of people did, it wasn't like they just put it back up.\" \n\"I would like to know, why was it suspended, why is Mark's suspended, what are the violations, okay, because if the Church of Scientology is just paying them off that's kind of weird, isn't it?,\" added Christman.\n\"Wikinews\" asked Christman if she knew if the suspension of Bunker's account had anything to do with the interview with Jason Beghe: \"Why Jason's video was pulled, I don't know, and I've spoken to Jason and he didn't know either.\"\nShe told \"Wikinews\": \"I would like to know why. Someone should have a right to be told 'you are screwing up on this, remove this video' ... 'change it'. But to never be notified and then just you're suspended, that's kind of weird, I think. And I have every intention of either, YouTube can contact me, or I'm going to keep contacting ... they need to let the people know what is going on.\"\nA YouTube spokeswoman told \"Wikinews\" that they would respond to our e-mails \"as soon as possible.\" Within two hours YouTube issued a statement to \"Wikinews\" saying that they \"do not comment on individual videos.\"\n\"YouTube takes these issues very seriously but we don't comment on individual videos. Our general approach is simple: we have clear content policies about what videos are allowed on the site. For example we prohibit clips that infringe copyright or show extreme violence. Videos that breach these rules are removed and we disable all accounts belonging to repeat offenders,\" said a spokesperson for YouTube. When asked, YouTube did not state when or if Bunker's account will be reinstated."}

The first part of his visit was spent in Washington, D.C.. He arrived on \"Shepherd One\", a specially dedicated plane belonging to Alitalia, the flag carrier of Italy.\nOn the first day of his visit to New York City, he went to the United Nations (UN) and addressed the General Assembly. In his speech he urged leaders to solve world crises together, though the world still remains subject to \"the decisions of a few,\" whom he did not name. Benedict XVI is the third Pope to address the United Nations in person.\nThe primary focus of his speech was about dialogue, diplomacy and human rights. He delivered the speech in both French and English. Benedict XVI said it was the duty of every nation to guarantee human rights.\n\"If states are unable to guarantee such protection, it is then up to the international community to intervene with the legal means that are provided for under the United Nations Charter and other international instruments,\" the Pope said.\nThe Pope argued that national sovereignty should not stand in the way of protecting human rights. \"On the contrary, it is indifference or non-intervention which cause the real harm,\" he said.\nThe concept of \"responsibility to protect,\" has also been championed by UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, in seeking international action in regions like Darfur.\nBenedict XVI said that religion should not be excluded at the UN because it is \"a social order respectful of the dignity and rights of the person.\" He further added \"It should never be necessary to deny God in order to enjoy one's rights. The rights associated with religion are all the more in need of protection if they are considered to clash with a prevailing secular ideology or with majority religious positions of an exclusive nature.\"\nOn Friday afternoon, after the UN address, Benedict met with members of the local Jewish clergy at the Park East Synagogue, an Upper East Side Orthodox synagogue in New York City.\n\"The Jewish community make a valuable contribution to the life of the city,\" Benedict XVI told the congregation, \"and I encourage all of you to continue building bridges of friendship with all the many different ethnic and religious groups present in your neighborhood.\"\nRabbi Arthur Schneier told the Pope, that the visit was \"a reaffirmation of your outreach, good will, and commitment to enhancing Jewish-Catholic relations.\"\nThursday, Benedict XVI held Mass at Nationals Park with an estimated 47,000 people attending. During the Mass he spoke about the sexual abuse by clergy. \"No words of mine can describe the pain and harm inflicted by such abuse nor the damage that has occurred within the community of the church,\" he said. \"I ask you to love your priests and affirm the good works they do.\"\nAfterwards, Benedict XVI met privately with some of the abuse victims. Reverend Federico Lombardi, a spokeperson, said he met with five or six abuse victims for approximately 25 minutes.\nOne of these victims, Bernie McDaid, told Associated Press (AP) about his meeting. \"I said, 'Holy Father, you need to know you have a cancer in your flock and I hope you will do something for this problem; you have to fix this,'\" McDaid said. \"He looked down at the floor and back at me, like, 'I know what you mean.' He took it in emotionally. We looked eye to eye.\"\nOlan Horne, another victim who has worked with McCaid told AP, \"I believe we turned the pope's head a little in the right direction.\"\nAccording to a Vatican official, Cardinal Se\u00e1n P. O'Malley, the Archbishop of Boston, gave the Pope a list of some 1,000 boys and girls who had been abused in the Boston Archdiocese going back several decades.\n\"The fact that we finally got the pope to actually stand up and put a statement on record, I really think he set the bar this week,\" said Gary Bergeron to the \"The New York Times\". Bergeron says he was abused by a priest in Lowell, Massachusetts.\nLater on Thursday, Benedict met with religious leaders of various faiths at the Pope John Paul II Cultural Center. He told them that, \"Americans have always valued the ability to worship freely and in accordance with their conscience\". He added, \"children of all religions sit side-by-side, learning with one another and from one another. This diversity gives rise to new challenges that spark a deeper reflection on the core principles of a democratic society. \n\"May others take heart from your experience, realising that a united society can indeed arise from a plurality of peoples, ... provided that all recognize religious liberty as a basic civil right,\" the pontiff said.\nDuring the next couple of days in New York, Pope Benedict XVI is scheduled to hold Mass at Yankee Stadium and visit the World Trade Center site."}

The public section reveals a number of problems that may have impacted on Auvinen's decision to conduct the attack, but says that police failed to find any conclusive motive. Also released was an animation depicting events at the school.\nThe report says Auvinen had been bullied since the age of ten and concludes the extent of this problem was greater than previously thought. Auvinen suffered from anxiety and blushing, especially in lessons, and had been diagnosed with a panic disorder, for which he had been prescribed medication. Auvinen also suffered from sleep disorders and loneliness, and had few friends, although one former bully did go on to become a good friend of Auvinen's. His mother said inability to settle on a suitable ideology contributed to Auvinen's depression.\nHis parents had noticed and reacted to the bullying problem, but their intervention only served to worsen the situation. According to entries in Auvinen's diary, he first began planning the shooting - which he gave the English name \"Operation Main Strike\" - about eight months prior to actually conducting the shooting.\nAuvinen had told his mother that under certain circumstances he could approve of violence. He had often viewed web sites promoting violence and had a number of online contacts whom he discussed his ideas with. One of these was a United States teen arrested for planning a similar attack, and two others discussed the Columbine High School Massacre with him and traded videos they found online. However, there is no evidence he informed anyone of his plans until immediately prior to the attack.\nThe report called Auvinen a moderately good student, but noted his mental problems had impacted his performance at school. He had been interested in politics from an early age, being involved with the Centre Party, the Social Democratic Party, the Left Alliance, and the Finnish Communist Party.\n\"In the best case, this (attack) would create massive destruction and chaos, or even a revolution,\" read one diary entry. \"In any case, I want this to be remembered forever. Maybe I'll even have a follower; after all, I am a super-person, almost God.\" Another revealed he intended to \"kill as many of you bastards as possible\". His diary also reveals he was aware he would be dead by the end of the attack.\nHe obtained a .22 calliber handgun which he named Catherine, having been denied a license for a 9mm gun, and submitted his plans online - including to YouTube - just 14 minutes prior to firing his first shots, having cycled to school. It was determined that, given the time-frame, there was little that could have been done by anyone who saw the material to prevent the attack. He fired 75 shots, 50 of which struck his eight fatally wounded victims, who were apparently chosen at random. Thirteen others were injured in the event.\nThe deceased were six students, the school headmistress and the school nurse. Auvinen shot at each several times in the region of the head and upper torso. He ultimately shot himself in the school toilet, and died in hospital from head wounds ten hours later, having never regained consciousness.\nPolice could not determine why he chose the date he did, although it was noted his online relationship with a foreign girl had ended just days before. It was also determined little could be done to predict and prevent future incidents, although one measure being sought is to require medical checks for gun licences and parental consent for prospective owners under 18.\nThe confidential section of the report discusses causes of death and police operations.\nSources.\n "}

It is a countryside smell.\"\nThe stench is expected to die down over the weekend but Met Office spokeswoman Helen Chivers says that if there are no south or south-westerly winds, \"it is possible it may hang around until Tuesday\"."}

The satellites will be placed into geosynchronous orbits, 35,000 kilometres above the equator, from where they will provide telecommunications services to various parts of the world. Star One C-2 separated from the carrier rocket 26 minutes after lift-off, and Vinasat-1 separated 31 minutes into the flight, completing a successful ascent.\nVinasat-1 will be operated by the Vietnam Posts and Telecommunications Corporation. It was constructed by Lockheed Martin, and is based on the A2100A satellite bus. It will provide C and Ku-Band communications. It will be positioned in a geosynchronous orbital slot at 132\u00b0E longitude, high above Vietnam. It has an expected on-orbit lifetime of 15 years and weighs 2637 kilograms. The programme was started in 1998, and launch was originally scheduled for 2005, but was delayed due to political issues concerning the communication frequencies that it was to use.\nThe other satellite being launched is Star One C-2, which will be operated by Star One. It is based on the SpaceBus 3000B3 satellite bus, and was constructed by Thales Alenia Space. It has a mass of 4100 kilograms, and is equipped with C, Ku, and X-band transponders. It will be positioned in a geosynchronous orbit at 65\u00b0W longitude, to provide services to the Americas.\nThis was the 18th orbital launch of 2008, and the second to be conducted by an Ariane 5. It was the 182nd launch to be conducted by Arianespace, and the 38th launch of an Ariane 5. The next Ariane launch is scheduled for late May, with Skynet 5C for the British Ministry of Defence, and Turksat 3A for Turksat.\nSpeaking after the launch had been confirmed to be a success, Jean-Yves Le Gall, the CEO of Arianespace remarked that he was \"delighted to share...this new success\", and that he appreciated the customers' trust. Jean-Marie Robert, of Thales Alenia Space, thanked Star One for trusting in their ability to deliver the satellite, and said that he hoped the satellite would have very long lives. Lincoln Oliveira, the CTO of Star One, thanked Arianespace and Thales Alenia Space for the success of his company's satellites. He also congratulated Vietnam on its first satellite launch. Lindsey Thompson, the Vice President for programmes of Lockheed Martin Commercial Space Systems, thanked her company's employees for the success of the mission, and wished Vinasat-1 well. Doan Hop Le, Vietnam's Minister of Information Technology and Communications said that the successful launch was important for \"confirming sovereignty of Vietnam in space\", that it had \"great technical and socio-economic significance\", and that it brought \"Vietnam's communication industry up to a new height\"."}

United States Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice also criticized Russia's decision. She called her Russian counterpart to express her concern. \"We are very concerned at the steps that have been taken and we have made our views known,\" Rice told reporters."}

In Zimbabwe votes from 23 out of the 210 constituencies are still being recounted after Mr. Mugabe suspected opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai of rigging the recent parliamentary elections. Mr. Tsvangirai claims that the delay in releasing the results is because Mr. Mugabe wants to \"steal the election.\"\nDockworkers in Durban refused to help unload the cargo of the \"An Yue Jiang\", threatening protests and violence if the government tried to do it without them. Many believed the arms were to be used by Mugabe and Zanu-PF to repress Zimbabwean citizens. Other protesters included unions and human rights groups, who made a petition for the ship to be expelled.\nAccording to the South African \"Mail &amp; Guardian\", the ship contained three million rounds of ammunition for AK-47s, 1,500 rocket-propelled grenades and several thousand mortar rounds sealed in blue and red boxes.\nThe South African government, which prefers 'quiet diplomacy' over 'megaphone diplomacy' when handling Zimbabwe said that the cargo was legally permitted to cross through South Africa, Defence Secretary January Masilela stated that \"if the buyer is the Zimbabwean sovereign government and the seller is the Chinese sovereign government, South Africa has nothing to do with that\".

The first event was a visit to the World Trade Center site in Lower Manhattan, New York City, New York.\nThe Pope rode his Popemobile down a ramp, to the bottom of the site. Accompanied by Cardinal Edward Egan, the archbishop of New York, he knelt at a rectangular pool and prayed silently for the victims of the September 11 attacks. Then he held up a single lit candle, before he began to speak.\n\"Turn to your way of love those whose hearts and minds are consumed with hatred,\" the Pope said. \"Grant that those whose lives were spared may live so that lives lost here may not have been lost in vain.\"\n\"God of peace, bring your peace to our violent world; peace in the hearts of all men and women and peace among the nations of the earth,\" he said. Afterwards, he met with family members of 16 of the victims and also with four of the rescue workers.\n\"I didn't really have anything to say to him,\" George Bachmann, a now-retired fire fighter, who broke his back and suffered burns as a first responder. \"Being in his presence was enough for me.\"\nIn the afternoon on Sunday, Benedict XVI travelled to The Bronx to hold Mass at Yankee Stadium, which is the home stadium for the New York Yankees baseball team. The stadium has been the scene of papal Masses by Paul VI in 1965 and John Paul II in 1979.\nThe Popemobile entered the stadium at 2:19 p.m. EDT (UTC-4) and drove around the baseball field in front of the crowd of over 57,000.\n\"Your pastoral visit is for all of us gathered here in New York a blessing for which we are all grateful,\" said Cardinal Egan in his introduction. \"It is an extraordinary privilege to be allowed to tell you what a deep and appreciated grace your presence is for all of us.\"\nBenedict XVI told the crowd that the Mass was \"a summons to move forward with firm resolve to use wisely the blessings of freedom, in order to build a future of hope for coming generations.\"\nDuring the homily, the Pope said \"The Gospel teaches us that true freedom, the freedom of the children of God, is found only in the self-surrender which is part of the mystery of love. Only by losing ourselves, the Lord tells us, do we truly find ourselves.\" He also touched on the subjects of peace, human rights and religious freedom which had been hallmarks of his previous addresses while in the United States.\nIt also marked the 200th anniversary of the archdioces in New York, Philadelphia, Boston and Louisville, which were all created in April 1808.\n\"It's like Jesus Christ visiting America,\" Clemens Semon, 50, a resident of Ozone Park, Queens who immigrated from Ivory Coast told \"The New York Times\". \"You see how many pack together, come together to see him? He's a unifier, he brings hope and peace.\"\nVice President Dick Cheney and his wife Lynne Cheney joined the Pope for the farewell ceremony at New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport. Senator and presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and former President Bill Clinton had been expected, but did not attend. They were even mentioned in Cheney's prepared remarks. \n\"You've encountered a nation facing many challenges, but with more blessings than anyone could count,\" Cheney said in his five-minute speech. \"All Americans respect your message of peace, justice and freedom.\"\nIn the Pope's remarks, the pontiff mentioned the visit to the World Trade Center site, \"My visit this morning to Ground Zero will remain firmly etched in my memory.\" His last comment as he turned to leave was, \"May God Bless America.\"\nBenedict XVI waved goodbye from the doorway of his Alitalia \"Shepherd One\" at 8:40 p.m. EDT.\nThe papal airplane \"Shepherd One\" touched down at Rome Ciampino Airport, Italy, at 10:40 a.m. CEST (UTC+2) on Monday."}

British-born American rocker Ozzy Osbourne, who, as well as a solo career, fronts the world-famous Black Sabbath, was the second night's headline act.\nThe festival's entertainment did not stop at the six main acts.

Their sets were accompanied by a special effects package from award-winning studio Weta Workshops, who are known for their work on movies such as The Lord of the Rings film trilogy. This came in the form of 'Drusila the Dragon', which rose up to a height of six foot and wigspan and moved for the audience, shining lasers from its eyes and breathing red smoke.

China has discouraged the actions of the \"radical\" protesters, and French President Nicolas Sarkozy sent a letter to a Chinese Olympic athlete who has gained national fame in China following a controversial incident in the Paris Olympic torch relay.\nAt a press conference on Tuesday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Jiang Yu said the demonstrations were \"encouraging and touching,\" but added that \"we do not agree with some people's radical actions.\" She added that China should continue to harbor friendly bilateral relations with France.\nThe Chinese state-run newspaper China Daily expressed the government's views on the protests in an editorial, warning against \"false patriotism\" and encouraging tolerance of differing opinions. \"Over-the-top nationalism is not constructive, but can do harm to the country,\" the English-language newspaper said. \"If we want to improve things, we will have to encourage responsible patriotism.\"\nSome Chinese protesters have called for a boycott of French goods, in particular the French retailer Carrefour, which Chinese bloggers accused of supporting the Dalai Lama. Carrefour denied this allegation, saying in an interview that \"Carrefour has not given any direct or indirect support to any political or religious cause.\"\nThe protests in China were a reaction to pro-Tibetan demonstrations held in Paris on April 7, when the Olympic torch was making its journey through the French capital. Pro-Tibet activists disrupted the torch relay by attempting to extinguish the flame or otherwise halt the proceedings. \nOne of the more controversial incidents of the torch relay involved Chinese Olympic fencer Jin Jing, who was one of the athletes chosen to bear the torch. Protesters tried to wrestle the torch from wheelchair-bound Jin, who is now regarded by many Chinese as a national hero because of the incident.\nFrench President Nicolas Sarkozy sent a letter to Jin, condemning the attack she suffered and praising her courage. \"I would like to express to you my deep feeling towards the way you were shoved in Paris on April 7 when you were holding the Olympic flame. You showed an outstanding courage, which honors you, and all your country,\" Sarkozy wrote in the letter. He also extended a personal invitation to her.\n\"This friendly move by President Sarkozy is appreciated by the Chinese people,\" said ministry spokeswoman Jiang Yu. The letter was personally delivered by French Senate President Christian Poncelet, who is scheduled to meet with Chinese President Hu Jintao and other Chinese leaders this week. Former French Prime Minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin is also scheduled to visit China."}

The plant was destroyed in a airstrike last September by Israeli F-15Is of 69 Squadron IAF. \nThe video allegedly also shows that the reactor core design is identical to that of North Korea's Yongbyon Nuclear Scientific Research Center reactor.\nIn a statement released to reporters the US government said, \"We are convinced, based on a variety of information, that North Korea assisted Syrian covert nuclear activities both before and after the reactor was destroyed.\"\nSyria has remained quiet over the incident and the area was bulldozed and the building later rebuilt around January. They have also disallowed international inspectors to visit the area, giving rise to suspicions that the Syrians are covering up something.\nThe Syrian ambassador to the United Kingdom, Sami Khiyami, has dismissed accusations by the United States that it is helping to build a reactor there that could produce plutonium. \"This has nothing to do with North Korea and Syria. They just want to exert more pressure on North Korea. This is why they are coming up with this story.\" Khiyami said.\nHe added, \"The cooperation between North Korea and Syria has nothing to do with [building] a nuclear facility. Cooperation is mainly economic.\"\nThe Syrian ambassador to the United Nations, Bashar Jaafari, concurred by saying, \"There was no Syria-North Korea cooperation whatsoever in Syria. We deny these rumours.\" Syria itself has denied cooperation with North Korea and is suggesting the video has been faked.\nAccording to the \"The New York Times\", there are suggestions inside the United States State Department, that the release of this video is an attempt by hardliners inside the Bush administration, including Vice President Dick Cheney, to undermine the six-party talks over North Korea's nuclear program.\n\"Making public the pictures is likely to inflame the North Koreans,\u201d one senior administration official said off the record. \"And that\u2019s just what opponents of this whole arrangement want, because they think the North Koreans will stalk off,\" he added.\nChristopher R. Hill, the Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs and the US negotiator in the six-party talks, believes the Syrian incident is a sideshow and that the more important issue is to stop North Korea from producing more plutonium and give up what it has.\nDick Cheney's office and other conservatives have said that a proposed deal, negotiated by Hill in the six-party talks, is unbalanced in favor of North Korea. According to the deal, North Korea would be removed from the State Sponsors of Terrorism list and have economic sanctions under the Trading With the Enemy Act lifted in return for declaring how much plutonium it has produced.\nRepresentative Pete Hoekstra, the ranking member of the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, said that as a result of the briefing, the six-party agreements would find it \"much harder to go through Congress and get agreements approved.\" Hoekstra said, \"It happened eight months later\" than it should have.\n\"I really believe [that] on an issue that is this critical to the issue of proliferation, to the situation in the Middle East, to what's going on in the six-party talks, and these types of things, Congress needed this information to be a full partner in those efforts,\" Hoekstra added.\nRepresentative Howard Berman, the chairperson for the Committee on Foreign Affairs said that details of the briefing were \"disturbing\" but not a reason to suspend the six-party talks.\n\"Rather, the information that has been released to the public demonstrates the importance of insisting on a verifiable enforcement mechanism to ensure that North Korea honors its commitments to stop spreading the means to create nuclear weapons and to end its nuclear program permanently,\" Berman said in a statement released by his office."}

President George W. Bush, who would have to sign the bill for it to become law, has voiced his support for the legislation.\nThe bill forbids employers from firing, refusing to hire, or otherwise discriminating against employees based on genetic information, such as a family history of a hereditary disease. It also makes it illegal for employers to request genetic information of an employee or the employee's family.\nHealth insurance companies are also addressed in the bill, which forbids them from requesting genetic information or using such information to set premium rates or determine enrollment eligibility. However, insurance companies would still have the right to base one's health coverage on the actual presence of a genetic disease.\n\"For the first time we act to prevent discrimination before it has taken firm hold and that's why this legislation is unique and groundbreaking,\" said Maine Senator Olympia Snowe, who sponsored the bill along with Sen. Kennedy and Sen. Mike Enzi. Snowe fears the threat of discrimination may discourage people from undergoing genetic testing, which can help to diagnose a wide range of diseases and lead to lifesaving therapy.\nKathy Hudson, director of the Genetics and Public Policy Center, reports that 92 percent are worried that information gained in genetic testing may be used against them. \"After a very long wait,\" she says, \"Americans can now be confident that their genetic information cannot be used by health insurers or employers in harmful or hurtful ways.\"\nOne part of the bill addresses this concern. \"Federal legislation establishing a national and uniform basic standard is necessary to fully protect the public from discrimination and allay their concerns about the potential for discrimination,\" the bill reads, \"thereby allowing individuals to take advantage of genetic testing, technologies, research, and new therapies.\"\nOklahoma Senator Tom Coburn initially blocked Senate action on the bill, warning that it could potentially lead to excessive lawsuits against employers and insurers. But after changes were made to the bill to ease his concerns earlier this week, he supported the legislation and allowed the Senate to vote on it. \"We certainly improved the bill from a liability standpoint,\" said Coburn, an obstetrician.\nSimilar bills were unanimously passed by the Senate in 2003 and 2005, but in both years the bill stalled in the House. The current bill was passed in the House of Representatives a year ago by a 420-3 vote. A genetic nondiscrimination bill was first introduced 13 years ago by New York Representatives Louise Slaughter, who says the House will \"get it out to the White House as quickly as we can.\" "}

Between the hours of 01:00 PDT (08:00 UTC) on April 24 and 16:00 PDT (23:00 UTC) on April 25, over 125 earthquakes, ranging in magnitude from 0.7 to 4.2 on the Richter scale, hit the Reno area. Six of the earthquakes were of magnitude 3.0 or greater, noticeably shaking local residents. The area has seen at least 500 earthquakes greater than magnitude 0.7 in the last two months; of those, about 45 have exceeded 2.0 on the Richter scale.\nNevada is the third most earthquake-active state in the United States, and the Reno area regularly sees seismological activity. However, recent events, particularly yesterday's series of tremors, have become alarmingly frequent for locals. The recent tremors are also unusual in that the most recent earthquakes have been the largest. The most common earthquake scenario is a large quake followed by smaller aftershocks."}

The 600-year-old landmark was considred one of the nation's greatest and most iconic, with some sources describing it as the single most important one in the country.\nThe 69-year-old male defendant has a previous conviction from two years ago for attempting to torch the palace, for which he received a suspended prison sentence and was fined. It is understood he destroyed the Namdaemun gate and attacked the palace over an unconnected land ownership dispute which had angered him. He felt that the compulsory purchase of his home a decade ago had been inadequatly compensated for by the state.\nAfter the fire, residents left flowers at the scene and wrote grieving notes.\nChae Jong-Gi, who admitted the crime, was told of the seriousness of the offence in a statement by the Seoul district court. \"A heavy sentence is inevitable as the accused inflicted unbearable agony on the people and damaged national pride... (The monument was) the treasure among all treasures which had survived all kinds of historic disasters. Even if restored, the gate's originality will never return. Therefore, the nature and consequences of this crime are very serious,\" said the statement.\nThe man is thought to have selected the gate as a target due to lax security measures. In the fire's aftermath, officials have been criticised over this and concerns that firefighting efforts were ineffective, and the Cultural Heritage Administration's chief resigned to show he accepted responsibility for the blaze.\nThe two storey gate in pagoda style was constructed in 1398 and despite a 1447 rebuild and multiple renovations still contained original timbers prior to the destruction in the fire. Only the stone base survived.\nAccording to the Cultural Heritage Administration, a reconstruction effort will take two to three years and cost 20 billion won (US$21 million)."}

Popularized by Japanese and American federations (e.g. World Wrestling Entertainment, New Japan Pro Wrestling, etc.) the ongoing events and news are often discussed on the Internet. As such, television programs and other mass media focused on pro-wrestling are commonplace in Japan, America, and Europe.\nIn Taiwan, fans do not simply watch the TV shows and discuss them via the Internet, but some of them participate in the sport of wrestling through communities from the Internet or colleges. Although a Taiwanese wrestler recently won a world-class pro-wrestling title, due to policies that focused only on promoting key athletic sports like baseball, billiards, basketball, and taekwondo (i.e. those with more possibilities to win a gold medal in the Asian Games or Olympics), governmental officials lost a great opportunity to promote sports like wrestling, which has many potential participants.\nWhat's the vision of wrestling in Taiwan? How did the communities drive TV spectators and wrestling fans and government officials pay more attention in wrestling? Is wrestling a future key sport in Taiwan? \"Wikinews\" Journalist visited the \"2008 IWL Spring Festival\", organised by a fan community and interviewed \"Mr. Orange\", well-known commentator of WWE TV shows broadcasted by VideoLand Max TV in Taiwan, to prospect the future of wrestling.\nInterview.\nHello, everyone! In my side is \"Mr. Orange\", WWE TV show commentator of VideoLand Max TV in Taiwan, I will do a special interview for topics related to wrestling, and he will do an overview of wrestling in Taiwan with his experiences.\nGlad to see an unofficial wrestling match in the Taipei City Mall. How did you involve in wrestling initially?\nMr. Orange: Since I'm in a childhood, I often watch (wrestling) shows with my neighborhood to a period when going to kindergarten. And then, I progressively understood the meaning of wrestling and finally involved in it.\nIn what region of a wrestling match did you watch at first?\nOrange: Europe and America. Matches in there are often packaged and refined excellently such as theme music, introduction, momentum of wrestlers better then matches in Japan, which just contained traditional rules.\nOn the other way of wrestling in Taiwan, what are the opportunities, possibilities, and threats?\nOrange: It was considered as a bad sport and not well-known in public opinion in Taiwan. As of some unofficial communities like us, we held periodical friendship matches to help the public correct their biased and wrong view of wrestling, especially the quote: \"Wrestling played reality not just a fight, scuffle, or violent sport.\" Because we [the wrestlers] were fully prepared in several professional trainings, we did wrestling without just acting and dishonesty although we player for spectators. For example, as of a famous sport from Korea - taekwondo, it fought without killing the other one but just to did enough with their best. \"Since I entered into the ring, I should do my best in a match to respond expectations from spectators rather than its results.\" That's a theory gained from a stable law of an action movie, its content besides of starting and ending should be rich and not to be hollowed.\nIn what opportunities did you become a commentator from a wrestling fan?\nOrange: Generally, I'm not a notable person, I just use the media as a promotion tool because we [the public] can't look down the strengths and impacts of public opinions and mass media. At that time, due to some coordination on behalf of broadcasting rights of TV programs, and many serious piracy and copyright issues in Taiwan, furthermore, pirates often used discussion boards to promote piracy. Those badly harmed several companies who do an agent of genuine copies. And accidentally, after a TV broadcaster grasped its opportunities on wrestling TV programs, I finally joined their production for commentary and planning of wrestling programs until now.\nUndergoing with trendy changes of wrestling?\nOrange: I met those opportunities coincidentally because when no one want to do it, and senior elites from media industry may not spare time to do production. I felt luckily on those undergoing experiences.\nBefore (its) production, what's your opinion on similar programs especially in Chinese-language?\nOrange: It's difficult or impossible for a broadcaster to produce their own and significant program because the public opinion have their wrong bias on wrestling. If the bias can be corrected, I think the public will not consider it as just a \"fighting\" or a \"violent\" sport, or to say: \"What are they doing?\" I chose the series programs of World Wrestling Entertainment because of its packages rather than a fistfight match which contained several complex rules like points or fouls, or just results rather than its content. Generally, if a significant program can be promoted, I think several wrong bias of wrestling should be corrected.\nGenerally OK. In your opinion, which pro-wrestling match do you recommend?\nOrange: There were several feature or significant matches in their own years. But I recommended two classic matches like NWA Championship in 1989 - \"Ric Flair vs Ricky Steamboat\", and a Steel Cage Match in 1981 - \"Ric Flair vs Jimmy 'Super Fly' Snuka\".\nBack to the topic of wrestling in Taiwan, besides of media, which tool will you use to promote it?\nOrange: The Internet - another media, a better way differ than mass media. By the way, by holding periodical friendship matches, it will work more effective. And of course, we [the IWL] hope the (friendship) matches can be held not only in Taipei but also in several divisions in Central or Southern Taiwan to correct conceptions on wrestling in a simple but relaxed match style.\nIf promoted via a portal of \"citizen journalism\"? Briefly, \"citizen journalism\" is a commentary, introduction, or a coverage with what incidents he or she witnessed or experienced differ than mass media.\nOrange: Really, that's a very better way to promote it because when connecting the Internet, the public frequently read topics related to current events like politics, society, and entertainment, focused by mass media and differ than what the common people need to know like some incidents just happened in their peripheral areas.\nFinally, do you have any expectation on wrestling in Taiwan.\nOrange: We [the wrestlers and wrestling fans] hope the common bias of \"violence\" can be properly corrected. After all, a pro-wrestling match is always ruled by its own policy, every wrestlers should undergo several strict trainings. As of IWL in Taiwan, we restrict our participants by a strict policy, and don't welcome athletes without any wrestling basis to join our community and fight in a ring because wrestling is like a gamble in consequence. Furthermore, parents should persuade their children not to imitate any wrestling moves at home. Like a submission, if not knowing its principle, a damage will be caused in one's body. Roughly to say, \"DON'T TRY THIS AT HOME\".\nOK, many thanks for this interview, \"Mr. Orange\"."}

In two separate instances, the IP address from the DOJ removed information from the Wikipedia article about the organization Committee for Accuracy in Middle East Reporting in America (CAMERA), regarding an attempt by the organization to secretly gain influence on the site. The IP address has been confirmed by \"Wikinews\" to be registered and used by the DOJ located in Washington, D.C.\nOn April 21, Electronic Intifada published a report based on leaked emails written between CAMERA and \"Wikipedia\" contributors who are allegedly planning to gain influence on the online encyclopedia. Information about CAMERA's campaign to influence Wikipedia was first added to the site's article about the organization on April 21 by user 'Bangpound', who cited the Electronic Intifada article. \nAccording to the edit history on the \"Wikipedia\" article CAMERA, the entire subsection relating to this controversy was removed by the IP address 149.101.1.130, which is hosted by 'wdcsun30.usdoj.gov' and is used by the DOJ. The IP address removed information regarding CAMERA's plan to \"cooperate with prominent Wikipedia editors to promote a Zionist viewpoint and oppose pro-Arab viewpoints on Wikipedia\" at least two separate times, on April 24 and April 25.\nThe IP address belonging to the DOJ also made edits identified as vandalism to the Wikipedia articles Tracy Jordan, Roger Ebert, and James E. Akins. After several warnings on the IP address's \"talk page\", the IP address was blocked for four days for \"repeated vandalism.\" Several hours prior to the DOJ edits, an IP address also from Washington D.C., 71.178.102.65, removed the same information. \"Wikinews\" can confirm the IP address is located in Washington D.C. and belongs to Verizon.\nWikipedia administrators were kept apprised in an ongoing discussion about the incident at Wikipedia's Administrators' noticeboard. \"The Justice employee is attempting to scrub any mention of CAMERA's activities to influence Wikipedia (now double-sourced) as seen here in this edit,\" said Wikipedia editor Lawrence Cohen, in an initial post to the Administrators' noticeboard.\nFounded in 1982, CAMERA is a pro-Israel media-monitoring and research non-profit organization based in Boston, Massachusetts. On April 21 the Electronic Intifada, a not-for-profit online publication which covers the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict from a Palestinian perspective, published an article describing efforts by CAMERA to secretly influence Wikipedia articles. According to the article, Electronic Intifada obtained a series of emails between CAMERA and members of Wikipedia, attempting to game the encyclopedia and influence articles on the site related to Israel.\nElectronic Intifada quoted a March 13 email from Gilead Ini, a Senior Research Analyst at CAMERA, who enlisted volunteers to make sure articles about Israel on Wikipedia were \"free of bias and error, and include necessary facts and context\". In a follow-up email from March 17, Ini emphasized secrecy, telling the email list members not to \"forward it to members of the news media\", and wrote that \"There is no need to advertise the fact that we have these group discussions.\" The media criticism organization Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting criticized the CAMERA emails, calling them \"particularly insidious\" because \"stealth and misrepresentation are presented as the keys to success.\"\nLater discussions in the series of emails obtained by Electronic Intifada included advice on how to get members of CAMERA elected as Wikipedia administrators, in order to gain influence. Wikipedia user 'Zeq' posted to the list: \"One or more of you who want to take this route should stay away from any Israel realted [sic] articles for one month until they [sic] interact in a positive way with 100 wikipedia [sic] editors who would be used later to vote you as an administrator.\"\nAfter the IP address belonging to the DOJ was blocked, Wikipedia editors informed the Wikimedia Foundation's Communications committee about the incident. Both \"Wikinews\" and Wikipedia are projects of the Wikimedia Foundation. In addition to the DOJ IP address, several Wikipedia users determined to be cooperating with the CAMERA campaign to influence Wikipedia had also previously been blocked by Wikipedia administrators.\n\"Wikinews\" requested a statement from the Department of Justice on the edits to Wikipedia, but as of this article's publication had not received a response."}

This not only echoed \"OBM\" theory discussed at 2007 Taiwan Brands' Trend Forum but also blended with a key element of production - \"creativity\".\nOn the other side of SYM Motors, to solve the transportation problem for TWTC Nangang, SYM Motors Taiwan imported manufacturing technology from Kinglong Bus Co., Ltd. to manufacture several 4th-cycle low floor buses and sell them to Chung-hsing Bus Co., Ltd. and Kwang-huang Bus Co., Ltd.

Drivers turned off their vehicles and stood at attention in the middle of the road, and pedestrians stopped and bowed their heads. Names of victims were read aloud in the Knesset, the legislature of Israel.\nIndividuals laid wreaths at a memorial for the Warsaw Ghetto uprising at Yad Vashem, Israel's official memorial to Jewish victims of the Holocaust. National ceremonies began at Yad Vashem on Wednesday evening, with the lighting of a flame by a Holocaust survivor.

Even today, we hear the horrible sounds of those who call for the destruction of the state of Israel. Even today we are forced to continue and fight for our right to have a national home in a safe place for the Jewish people in their own land. We have learned our lesson and we take very seriously the threats of state leaders who call for the destruction of Israel,\" said Ashkenazi.\nHamas television Thursday suggested that the Holocaust was organized by Jews to wipe out the disabled among their own people to prepare for the creation of a Jewish state. \"The Israeli Holocaust - the whole thing was a joke, and part of the perfect show that (Zionist leader and future Israeli prime minister) Ben Gurion put on,\" said head of the Palestinian Centre for Strategic Research Amin Dabur, according to Jerusalem-based Palestinian Media Watch. Dabur said that the \"young energetic and able\" went to Israel, and that those who were disabled were sent \"so there would be a Holocaust\". \nThough Iran has said that its nuclear program is peaceful in nature, the United States, Israel, and other countries believe it is attempting to construct nuclear weapons. In speeches Iran's President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has said that the Jewish state should be destroyed. Ahmadinejad has called the Holocaust \"a myth\". Tehran hosted a revisionist Holocaust conference in 2006, which provoked international criticism. Tel Aviv University published a study on Monday saying that acts of anti-Semitism in 2007 increased by about seven percent over 2006."}

The city's Department of Buildings lifted an order to cease work imposed at the time as the buiding's owners have installed fire control systems at the condemned 26 storey office block.\nThe building was seriously damaged in the September 11, 2001 attacks as the south tower of the World Trade Center collapsed, filling the building with debris, much of it toxic. In subsequent years fragmental remains of hundreds of victims from the disaster were removed from the building and regulators had lengthy debates over how the tower should be demolished.\nAfter the fire, work immediately halted and a grand jury criminal investigation followed. The fire is thought to have been triggered by a cigarette discarded by a worker on the site, which will ultimately home one of five new towers planned for the area devastated by the attacks. Of major importance were polyethylene and plywood decontamination barriers which both fueled the blaze and hindered the movement of firefighters. It is thought they may have blocked escape for the two who were killed by the fire.\nThe Lower Manhattan Development Corporation, who owns the property, says 300 asbestos removal workers are set to begin shifts of six days per week are set to clear toxic material remaining on 19 floors of the tower. This means the work force has increased by one hundred. Decontamination chambers will now be present across all floors instead of merely the ground floor.\nAmongst the new safety measures are fire-proof sheetrock decontaminaton chambers, improved safety within the actual chambers and two fire-rated interior stairways. The modifications were made by LVI Environmental Services with work commencing in February this year.\nThe tower at 130 Liberty Street was originally intended to be gone by 2005, but the deadline was expanded to 2008. The fire means the work has been delayed a year with a revised estimated time of completion being 2009.\nSources.\n "}

The up and coming band, Spyte, helped to open New Zealand Music Month 2008 by playing a concert at the Cathedral Square in the centre of Christchurch. Gabriel Pollard sat down and talked to the members of Spyte after watching their gig.\nThe annual Kiwi music showcase, which officially began yesterday, had various bands playing, ranging from jazz to heavy metal. While Spyte don't associate themselves with a particular genre as to not restrict themselves, the \"unofficial leader\" of Spyte, Bex Thomas, told me that they generally play heavy metal like they did today.\nThe band members of Spyte include Bex Thomas as guitarist, Logan Ellis as drummer and Stuart Hunter as bassist. They met each other at Christchurch's School of Rock.\nThey are looking to add new members after dropping some members earlier in the year, including a new drummer when Mr Ellis moves back onto guitar and a vocalist. Because they are yet to secure a vocalist, their current songs are instrumental.\nSpyte played both of their songs at the Christchurch City Council-organised concert today because a third was not ready in time. Ms Thomas said they didn't have enough time to prepare if they were to play three songs.\nOne spectator listening to Spyte play described their performance as \"awesome\". Clay Shaw says, \"I feel that they produced a very unique sound even though they had to make it quieter than normal due to noise restrictions.\"\nWhen Spyte formed last year they didn't have a name and quickly chose one when asked if they had a band name right before jumping on stage. When asked the origins behind the name, Ms Thomas said, \"We didn't want to risk having the same name as another band and it looks better.\"\nThe band tries to practice around once a week at least, but, as Ms Thomas says, \"You can't practice too much if you're a musician.\"\nAll members of the band are serious about music and all indicate they wish to have a career in music in the future. Ms Thomas says she would like to be a professional musician or a guitar technician, but failing that she would fall back on psychology. She says, \"It's hard to get into the New Zealand music industry. You've got to be realistic.\" Mr Hunter also says he would like to be a professional musician, but is training to become a chef if the former isn't possible. And Mr Ellis says he would like to be a music producer or a session musician.\nSpyte have so far had three gigs, including today's one but would be able to get many more if they \"tried\".\nGallery.\nAll photographs below were taken by Gabriel Pollard."}

Anis Shorrosh, 75, of Daphne, Alabama, was arrested after a fire was discovered Tuesday night in the trash room of the Loma Alta Towers condominium where he lives. 50 residents had to be evacuated from the building, but no one was hurt.\nAfter a burning plastic garbage container set off the alarm, one of the building residents put out the fire using a fire extinguisher. Law enforcement are still investigating the incident, and are not yet certain why the tax records were set on fire.\nAccording to local police, members of the condo owners association had signed a warrant on Monday, accusing Shorrosh of criminal mischief for allegedly tampering with the security system of his building. \"He had gotten frustrated with the security system, and he took a hammer to it,\" said Police Lieutenant Jud Beedy.\nLt. Beedy said that if the fire had gotten worse than it was, there could have been injuries or deaths, saying \"He endangered a lot of people.\" According to Lt. Beedy, building security cameras caught Shorrosh on camera entering and exiting the trash room of the building. Police Chief David Carpenter told WKRG \"News 5\", the CBS affiliate in Mobile, that Shorrosh used an accelerant to start the fire, in what police believe was an attempt to burn the building down.\nShorrosh is in custody on a US$25,000 bond. He has spoken critically to Christian organizations and radio programs about Islam, and has claimed that Muslims in South Africa thrice attempted to kill him in 1989.\nShorrosh has appeared opposite Muslims in debates between Islam and Christianity, and is the author of 10 books including \"Islam: a Threat or a Challenge\", and \"Islam Revealed\". In 2006, the United States government issued a disclaimer denying that the book \"The True Quran\", written by Shorrosh, was a \"new American Quran\". The U.S. government stated that the book was Shorrosh's attempt to convert Muslims to Christianity.\nShorrosh is a Palestinian Arab, and according to his website www.islam-in-focus.com he was born in the town of Nazareth.

The bus ended the roll back the right way up and was completely destroyed by the fire. One wheel lay twelve metres from the main wreckage and skid marks were left on the road. The coach had been travelling from a resort at nearby Sharm el-Sheikh to the capital Cairo when it crashed at Abu Zenima, with some reports suggesting the cause was a blowout on a tyre.\nAccording to the Egyptian security official eight Russian nationals were killed, as was one of two drivers on board, both of whom were Egyptian. This was contradicted by Russian state owned service \"RIA Novosti\", which stated just two Russians were among the dead. The Russian foreign ministry only said 16 Russians were injured and none killed, also contradicting the Egyptian security official who said only 14 people were injured in total. The Ukrainian foreign ministry said a Ukrainian woman had been killed and the Romanian foreign ministry said a 41-year-old Romanian woman was amongst the dead. The driver behind the wheel at the time survived the accident.\nThe crash occurred at 6:00 am (0300 GMT) about 70km (45 miles) from Suez, and many of the injured were rushed to hospital there. Traffic officials, security personnel, civil defence soldiers and ambulances all responded to the crash. In addition, the Azure Travel coach, like all Egyptian tour buses, had at least one armed police officer travelling on board.\nOther injured passengers were taken to Sharm. Two Canadians and two British citizens are reported to be amongst the injured. The Brits are in a serious condition and one Canadian woman had her hand amputated. At least one person died in hospital. It is also reported that Italians were injured in the crash.\nRoad accidents claim around 6,000 lives and injure 30,000 every year in Egypt. This high accident rate is fed by poor maintenance and regulatory enforcement and reckless driving, with many roads allowing high rates of speed to be achieved. A fog-triggered pile-up killed 29 in February, and 23 died in March in a head-on collision between two lorries."}

When this falls below a certain level, treatment switches to second-line ARVs.\nBut because of limited access to laboratory tests, the WHO recommends that people in the developing world are monitored for clinical signs of HIV progression, such as bacterial infection in the mouth and certain types of cancer.\nMonitoring of CD4 cell levels \u2014 an indicator of the health of a patient's immune system \u2014 is also used when laboratory testing is available. Until now, little was known about the effectiveness of this strategy.\nThe researchers used a computer model to simulate the course of HIV infection and estimate the impact on survival of monitoring by viral load, CD4 count or clinical observation. \nThe model was initially developed for wealthy countries, but was adapted for lower-income countries by taking into account factors such as interruptions in drug supply.\nIt predicts that after five years, 83 per cent of patients monitored by viral load, 82 per cent of patients monitored by CD4 cell count, and 82 per cent of patients monitored by clinical examination alone, would have survived. This decreases to 67, 64 and 64 per cent, respectively, after 20 years.\nAndrew Phillips, professor of epidemiology at the UK-based Royal Free &amp; University College Medical School and lead author of the study, says the findings shouldn't dissuade people from relying on viral-load monitoring.\n\"I certainly wouldn't want to inhibit the roll-out of viral-load monitoring and the development of cheap and robust tests that don't rely heavily on infrastructure or highly skilled laboratory staff,\" he told SciDev.Net.\nBut, he says, that shouldn't be done at the cost of getting ARVs to everyone who needs them.\n\"The issue of whether to use viral-load monitoring or not pales into insignificance when dealing with whether you've actually got everyone who needs ARVs on therapy. Having drugs without viral-load monitoring is a lot better than not having drugs.\""}

In an April ruling, the North Rhine-Westphalia Higher Administrative Court in M\u00fcnster refused to consider an appeal made by the Church of Scientology to a February court decision sanctioning the monitoring of Scientology by Germany's intelligence agencies.\nThe agency which monitors Scientology in Germany is called the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (Germany's domestic intelligence agency), and has had the Church of Scientology under surveillance in Germany since 1997. The February ruling by the North Rhine-Westphalia Higher Administrative Court stated: \"There are concrete indications that Scientology's activities are to implement Scientology's program in Germany and to expand more and more Scientology's principles in government, economy and society\".\nIn the statement released Tuesday by the Church of Scientology's branch in Germany, the organization said it \"felt it was time to reflect on the whole purpose of this battle of legal material and reach a sensible solution.\"\nThe Church of Scientology took German authorities to court in March 2003, seeking to stop further surveillance of their organization. In a November 2004 ruling, a court in Cologne upheld the legality of the German government's surveillance of the Church of Scientology. The 2004 ruling was upheld on February 12, 2008, in an appeal to the Higher Administrative Court in M\u00fcnster.\nIn December 2007 top security officials in Germany asserted that the aims of Scientology are in conflict with the country's constitution, and requested that authorities investigate whether to ban Scientology in Germany. In January the interior affairs chief of the State of Saxony told the Associated Press (AP) that he thought a ban on Scientology in Germany was unlikely to occur.\nIn a post Wednesday to the newsgroup alt.religion.scientology, Scientology critic Raymond Hill commented on Scientology's recent actions, asking: \"Scared that too much public awareness would be brought on its internal documents?\" Hill runs the website \"Scientology Critical Directory\" at www.xenu-directory.net. \nIn a blog post at a website for \"The Washington Post\", Claire Hoffman was critical of Scientology's treatment in Germany, writing: \"While I'm well aware of their checkered past, decrying it unconstitutional seems like a threatened position to take by a nation.\"\nGerman Church of Scientology spokeswoman Sabine Weber told the AP that the organization has added a \"declaration on human rights and democracy\" to its bylaws, and has designated an individual to run its human rights program in the country.\nThe United States Department of State has criticized Germany for its surveillance of Scientology in its annual Human Rights Report."}

Wayne Bent, 66, referred to by his followers as Michael Travesser, was arrested by state police at his compound near Union County, New Mexico. Bent is the leader of a group called the Lord Our Righteousness Church, which moved to its present location in New Mexico near the Colorado border in 2000. His followers refer to the compound and the community as Strong City, and a former member estimates that approximately 50 people live at the compound. \nDepartment of Public Safety spokesman Peter Olson told the Associated Press (AP) that Bent was charged with three counts of criminal sexual contact with a minor and three counts of contributing to the delinquency of a minor. Clayton, New Mexico Police Department Chief Scott Julian confirmed the charges in a statement to ABC News. \nBent's bail was set at US$500,000 cash by the local magistrate, and his arraignment is set for Thursday in Clayton. According to United Press International, Bent denies that he has had sex with minors but admitted to \"lying with naked virgins\". Bent is being held at the Clayton-Union County Consolidated Detention Facility pending his arraignment.\nState child welfare officials had received reports of inappropriate contact between Bent and children in the group. Last month, New Mexico authorities removed two girls and one boy from the compound. State Children, Youth and Families Department spokeswoman Romaine Serna told the AP that the children were removed from the compound following an April 22 investigation. \"We did receive information alleging inappropriate contact with minors on the compound,\" said Serna in a statement to ABC News. The children were taken into state custody. The affidavit for Bent's arrest warrant alleges that he touched three underage girls in 2006 and 2007. One of the girls was under the age of 12, and all were under age 18. \nBent was previously a preacher for the Seventh-day Adventist Church. After leaving the church in 1987 with a small group of his followers, he moved them to the current compound in Union County, where he claims to have received a message from God where he was told he is the Messiah: \"One day I was in my trailer just relaxing and there was nothing on my mind in particular and then God said to me you are the Messiah\". Some of Bent's followers left the group after his proclamation that he was the Messiah, but the wives of two members of the group had sex with him in what they believed was a testament to his divinity. Bent admits that he has also had sex with the wife of his son Jeff. \nPrudence Welch, a former member of the group who left in 2005, was interviewed by Bill O'Reilly on the program \"The O'Reilly Factor\" on FOX News. When O'Reilly asked Welch if Travesser/Bent was doing anything illegal at the compound, Welch responded: \"Well, I think that laying naked with underage girls is illegal.\" She also commented: \"The last eight years is when it got the worst, and when I left I realized how manipulative he [Bent] was.\"\nBent had predicted that the world would end on October 31, 2007. The group was profiled in a documentary film which aired Wednesday on the National Geographic Channel, titled \"Inside a Cult\". The film was adapted from the documentary \"End of a World Cult\", which was shown last year on Britain's Channel 4. All of the minors that had been removed from the compound in April appear in the documentary. The documentary also discusses controversial groups Peoples Temple, Branch Davidians and Heaven's Gate and their respective leaders Jim Jones, David Koresh and Marshall Applewhite."}

He is also the first individual to be sentenced regarding the cartel. He, as well as Stephen Cleary, group general manager for freight in Sydney, Harold Pang, general manager for freight sales in Singapore, Peter Frampton, former group general manager for freight, John Cooper former general manager for freight sales and Desmond Church, a former freight employee, were all charged after being exempt from immunity granted in a plea bargain by Qantas in which the airline paid a US$61 million fine. \nIn Australia price fixing is not actually a criminal offense, so former head of freight Peter Frampton and three other staff members in Australia will not be extradited to face charges. Meanwhile, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission is seeking admittances of guilt from airlines whose operations fall under its jurisdiction in exchange for lighter penalties. Qantas is amongst those airlines.\nThe cartel, which prevented competition in air freight shipments rates, is said to involve almost thirty airlines. As well as Qantas, Japan Airlines, British Airways, Korean Air and Lufthansa have all had their involvement confirmed. Whistleblower Lufthansa, a German airline, was granted immunity from prosecution in exchange for exposing the operation. In August, British Airways and Korean Air pled guilty to their involvement and received fines of US$300 million each. Last month Japan Airlines also admitted to their role and paid a US$110 million fine. Amongst the others alleged to be involved are Air New Zealand, Singapore Airlines and Cathay Pacific. Hundreds of Australian businesses are involved in a class action suit against these seven airlines for AU$200 million that they believe was unfairly charged to them as a result of criminal activity.\nMcCarthy, who ran Qantas's Australia-US cargo route for twenty years, entered a plea bargain with the authorities. Under the US Sherman Act he could have faced up to a US$1.06 million fine and up to 10 years imprisonment, but the DoJ says that the maximum fine could actually be double the gain from the offences committed or double the loss of those victimised if either were found to be higher than the normal maximum.

But there was no acknowledgement from Myanmar's meteorological office, or any indication of a response.\nMohapatra says IMD's first warning bulletin, issued on 1 May, indicated the land area likely to be hit by the cyclone. It warned that a cyclone with wind speeds of 180 kilometres per hour would cross the southwest coast of Myanmar sometime between 8pm and midnight on the night of the 2 May.\nIMD's bulletins contain information on the actual and predicted centre, intensity and movement of the cyclone, as well as sea conditions and maximum wind speeds around the cyclone centre.\nUma Charan Mohanty, from the Asian Disaster Preparedness Centre in Thailand, said that, according to the World Meteorological Organisation's data, Asian cyclones are fewer and less intense than hurricanes in the Atlantic Ocean or typhoons in the Pacific Ocean region, but they cause more death and destruction. In 2005, 25 hurricanes in the Atlantic caused 10 deaths, but cyclone Sidr, which hit Bangladesh in 2007, left 3,500 dead.\nMohanty says that the Atlantic coast has a good early-warning system and people have the means to drive to safer areas. In contrast, Asian coasts are densely populated, with many poor fishing and farming communities who cannot evacuate on their own, even if they have been warned.\nNews agencies quote Maung Swe, Myanmar's minister for relief and resettlement, who told a press conference (6 May) that most deaths were caused by a 3.5-metre-high storm surge \u2014 a wall of water that develops when cyclonic winds churn up sea water.\nMohanty says that 85 per cent of cyclone deaths are due to storm surges and that predictions of the size and location of such surges are critical in disaster forecasting.\nAsian coasts are also becoming increasingly vulnerable because of the loss of protective mangrove forests that serve as windbreaks and limit damage by storm and tidal surges.\nIn a 2006 report, the International Union for Conservation of Nature said that areas in Sri Lanka with mangrove forests suffered less damage in the 2004 Asian tsunami, compared with regions where forests had been destroyed.\nAnd in January 2008, the UN Food and Agriculture Organization warned that Asia is fast losing its coastal mangroves, with more than 1.9 million hectares being destroyed each year.\nThe organisation's report reviewed the world's mangroves between 1980 and 2005. It found that the mangrove forests around Myanmar's Irrawady Delta had degraded because of \"overexploitation\" and the conversion of land for rice fields \u2014 promoted by the government as a way to ensure self-sufficiency in food production.\nGovernment officials in Myanmar have said that 22,464 people have been confirmed dead from Cyclone Nargis.\nOnly once rescue workers reached the hardest hit areas of the storm did they begin to realize the extent of damage that had occurred. At least 10,000 people died in one town alone, Bogalay in the Pyapon District of the country.\nThe United Nations has reported that one million people are homeless, or in need of help in some other way."}

Nunes gained attention on YouTube and got featured on the front page for her quirky, self-recorded performances.\nNunes is a graduate of Fairport High School, New York and is now a college freshman. Nunes performed a half-hour set of songs, about half of which were of her own composition and the rest covers of other artists. During the first half of her set she played the ukulele and thereafter the guitar.\nDespite Nunes' well-received set, it was clear that the crowd was there to see Ben Folds perform. The American singer-songwriter and former frontman of the musical group Ben Folds Five is widely acclaimed for his prowess as a pianist, songwriter and performer.\nBen Folds performed unaccompanied, aside from \"tambourine man\", a stage hand who appeared briefly during three songs. Folds told the audience that he had been nervous as this was his first solo performance in \"a while.\"\nDuring the 100 minute concert, Ben Folds played many of his hits, including \"Rockin' the Suburbs\", \"Annie Waits\", \"Still Fighting It\" and \"Zak and Sara\".\nFolds also played a couple of songs that he said he wrote during a contract dispute with a record company. He wrote the songs because they were \"mandatory\" in his contract. According to Folds, he asked how many songs he had to write to get out of his contract. They told him, he had to write 4.6 songs to complete his obligation. Thusly, one of the songs was called, \"One Down And 3.6 to Go\".\nNear the end of the set, Ben Folds stood on his piano and directed the crowd as a choir. The audience was eager to participate in this experiment, which consisted of humming in different notes, and seemed to enjoy it. Folds seemed quite earnest in his appreciation of the audience's efforts.\nAfter the set ended, the enthusiastic crowd of mostly WCSU students started to call out for Folds to reappear.

The crash of Flight 38 injured one passenger seriously and 12 others on board, including four crew members, as well as being the first hull loss of a B777.\nThe latest word from the United Kingdom's Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) is that both engines had low fuel pressure in their high pressure (HP) fuel inlets, leading to the failure of both engines. Having departed from Beijing, China the aircraft was on final approach for landing at Heathrow when the thrust on the engines first reduced and became unresponsive, then ceased completely. The copilot, who was flying the aircraft at the time, received significant media praise for gliding the aircraft past housing and airport barriers to crash land the airliner onto the grass at the runway threshold, likely saving the 136 passengers and 16 crew from death or further injury as well as preventing potential ground casualties. The landing gear collapsed and the airframe, wings and engines were significantly damaged.\nEach HP inlet also exhibited \"unusual and fresh cavitation damage to the outlet ports consistent with operation at low inlet pressure\", according to the AAIB's latest report on investigatory progress, which also states engine failure was definitely caused by low pressure and that the autothrottle had opened up appropriate valves fully in an effort to increase fuel flow, but to no avail. The report indicates the investigation has also considered an area of unusually cold air over Russia which the B777 passed through at 40,000 feet on its journey. Between the Ural mountain range and East Scandinavia the air was found to have been as low as -76\u00b0C. The AAIB has ruled out fuel turning to ice as the fuel temperature never fell below -34\u00b0C. This is compared to an average freezing temperature of -47\u00b0C for jet fuel and test showing the fuel in the B777's tanks needed cooled to at least -57\u00b0C before it froze. Floating ice particles had previously been suggested as a possible causal factor.\nHowever, it has been suggested outside of the investigation that although the fuel did not freeze, it could have become unusually thickened, restricting its flow through the HP inlets, although the temperatures did remain within what are currently considered safe levels. Another possible explanation was that the fuel was contaminated or of inferior quality, but the AAIB has ruled this out. Also disproved are suggestions that the plane suffered a bird strike or that it was disrupted by electromagnetic interference from jamming devices set up to protect a motorcade carrying Prime Minister Gordon Brown.\nThe report says that there was also no evidence to suggest any control systems failed, that the aircraft encountered a wake vortex or that there was core engine icing or other evidence that the engines suffered core lock. There was no damage to the fuel systems excluding that caused by the low pressure and no blockages, therefore it is suspected that fuel flow was restricted.\nThe investigation has also begun analysing previous flights on comparable aircraft in a large sample of flights. Thus far, no parameters present on Flight 38 have been found that differ significantly from anything previously encountered. The purpose is primarily to identify potentially troublesome combinations of unusual operational parameters.\nThe report concludes by stating that interested parties to the investigation, specifically the Federal Aviation Administration, the , the Civil Aviation Authority and British Airways are being kept fully informed of the investigation's progress.\nAlthough this shows some progress, according to David Learmount, operations and safety editor at periodical industry magazine \"Flight International\", \u201cThis report takes us absolutely nowhere, I think they still have no idea.\u201d\nThe B777 has never had any other hull losses or any fatal accidents and is considered to have one of the world's safest commercial airliners. According to one spokesman for British Airways \u201cIt has one of the best safety records of any commercial aircraft. At no stage since the accident has the AAIB, Boeing or Rolls Royce advised against the continued operation of the Boeing 777.\u201d \nThe engines underwent analysis at manufacturer Rolls-Royce's facility in Derby, while airframer Boeing is studying the fuel systems in the United States. Rolls Royce's engine test bed was modified to replicate control inputs from aircraft control systems, and Boeing are working at replicating the cold conditions experienced over Eastern Europe. The investigation is ongoing.\nSources.\n "}

The latest deadline for reinstating the judges was set for May 12, as talks between Sharif and PPP leader Asif Ali Zardari ended in London without reaching any deal. The government had originally promised to reinstate the judges by April 30. \nMost of the disagreement lies within the question of how much power should be returned to the judges. Sharif has campaigned for a total reinstatement of power, while Zadari favors constitutional amendments that would limit their power.\nInformation Secretary Ehsan Iqbal, one of the ministers who will be resigning, supported Sharif's campaign for reinstatement. He called the series of events \"a defining moment\" for Pakistan. \"Without the rule of law, without an independent judiciary, the country cannot move ahead democratically or constitutionally,\" he said.\nAt a press conference, Sharif said he will contest the by-elections on August 18, which could earn him a seat in Parliament. The Pakistan Peoples Party say they will not put a candidate against him in the elections.\n\"A day will come when the judges shall be restored,\" Sharif said. \"If we surrender on this issue to the wishes of the military dictator, it will take us generations before we get an independent judiciary.\" He also said that despite quitting the government, he wishes to continue supporting the PPP-led government on an issue-by-issue basis. \"We will not become part of any conspiracy to destabilize the democratic process,\" he said.\nThe Pakistan Peoples Party responded in a statement. They called the announcement of resignation \"a pause in the process and not a break in the purpose of restoration of judges\". They also said they do not intend to fill the vacated ministries, hoping the issue can be solved \"amicably and in a spirit of accommodation and mutual trust\".\nSome analysts fear the judicial dispute will extend further, leaving the government unable to focus on more important issues facing the country. \"This is a huge setback for the government,\" said Shuja Nawaz, a Pakistani security analyst in Washington, D.C.. \"This crisis will distract attention from critical issues, and the real losers will be the people of Pakistan.\""}

Under the 2006 Military Commissions Act those charged must be arraigned within 30 days and have their trial commenced within four months.\nThe men are accused of plotting the attacks, in which four passenger airliners were hijacked in US airspace. One was flown into each tower of the World Trade Center, one was flown into the Pentagon and the fourth crashed in a Pennsylvania field. Almost 3,000 people were killed. 19 hijackers were involved, with one aircraft having four hijackers compared to five on the others, triggering theories concerning a 20th hijacker. It is alleged that Qahtani missed out on this role because he was unable to get past anti-immigration measures to upon arrival in Florida, where head hijacker Mohammed Atta is said to have been waiting.\nThose who are set to go to trial are alleged members of Al-Qaeda, who were found to be responsible for the attacks. They are Walid bin Attash, Ramzi Binalshibh, Ali Abdul Aziz Ali, Mustafa Ahmed Hawsawi and alleged 9/11 mastermind Khalid Shaikh Mohammed.\nThey have all been charged with conspiracy, murder in violation of the laws of war, attacking civilians, attacking civilian objects, intentionally causing serious bodily injury, destruction of property, terrorism and material support for terrorism while all but Hawsawi are charged with hijacking aircraft as well.\nSome concern has been made over alleged human rights abuses. Officials have said themselves that Qahtani was harshly treated in imprisonment and Khalid was subjected to waterboarding.\nQahtani also withdrew an earlier confession saying it was obtained from him under torture. He submitted a detailed written account describing abuse he alleges against him including beatings, being forced into uncomfortable positions for long periods, threats with dogs, exposure to music at high volume, being subjected to freezing temperatures and being forced to appear naked in front of female personnel.\nThe arraignments will take place at the high security Guantanamo war crimes tribunal, and will mark the first public appearances of the men since their capture. The trial will mark the first in front of a US war crimes tribunal since World War Two, and the first capital one at this tribunal as prosecutors are seeking the death penalty for all of the men.\nSources.\n "}

The infringement claim is in reference to a URL used as a source in a \"Wikinews\" article about Mormon Church documents leaked to the website Wikileaks, titled \"Copy of handbook for leaders of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints obtained by Wikinews\". The URL was originally cited as a link in the sources subsection of the article. The Wikimedia Foundation is a donor-supported non-profit organization which runs Wikipedia and \"Wikinews\". This is the first time that the Wikimedia Foundation has received a copyright infringement claim regarding an article published by \"Wikinews\".\nThe \"Wikinews\" article, originally published on April 19, described material in the \"Church Handbook of Instructions\". The work is a two-volume book of policies and is a guide for leaders of the Mormon Church. \"Wikinews\" obtained the \"Church Handbook of Instructions\" from Wikileaks, a whistleblower website which publishes anonymous submissions of sensitive documents while preserving the anonymity of its contributors. Wikileaks describes the material as significant because \"...the book is strictly confidential among the Mormon (Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, aka LDS in short form) bishops and stake presidents and it reveals the procedure of handling confidential matters related to tithing payment, excommunication, baptism and doctrine teaching (indoctrination).\" \nThe material was released on the Wikileaks website on April 16, and according to the site was first made available on the document sharing website Scribd. A message at Scribd now states: \"This content was removed at the request of copyright agent B. S. Broadbent of the Intellectual Property Division of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.\" \nOn May 5, the Wikimedia Foundation received a copyright infringement claim from Intellectual Reserve, Inc., the legal entity that owns the intellectual property of the Mormon Church. The infringement claim is addressed to Jimmy Wales, the designated agent of the Wikimedia Foundation, and requests that access to the link to Wikileaks be removed. The link was removed from the article on May 5 by a \"Wikinews\" administrator, and the article remains available without the link. The infringement claim was sent by Berne S. Broadbent, president of Intellectual Reserve, Inc. and director of the Intellectual Property Division of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. According to Mike Godwin, general counsel for the Wikimedia Foundation, the Mormon Church has not filed a Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) notice with the foundation.\nIn 1999, Jerald and Sandra Tanner, prominent critics of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, released material from the \"Church Handbook of Instructions\" to the Internet through their organization Utah Lighthouse Ministry, without including the copyright notice of Intellectual Reserve, Inc. or obtaining permission from the church. The website of the Utah Lighthouse Ministry describes as its purpose: \"...to document problems with the claims of Mormonism and compare LDS doctrines with Christianity.\" The Tanners had received a copy of the 1998 edition of \"Church Handbook of Instructions\" from an anonymous sender in October 1999. They published 17 pages of the 160-page handbook on the Utah Lighthouse Ministry website.\nThe church sent the Tanners a letter threatening a copyright infringement lawsuit if the material was not removed, and the Tanners removed the material from their site the same day, and posted the church's letter to their website. The website still contained links to other locations that had the material, and an article in the \"Salt Lake Tribune\" listed addresses of these links. The church sued the Tanners through its company Intellectual Reserve, in the 1999 case \"Intellectual Reserve v. Utah Lighthouse Ministry\". \nThe plaintiffs filed their complaint on October 13, 1999, and the United States district court issued a preliminary injunction on December 6, 1999 barring posting of the material by the defendants as well as posting links to other websites which contain the material. \"The New York Times\" and other news publications called the injunction a \"chilling effect\". In November 2002, the church dropped the lawsuit against Utah Lighthouse Ministry, on condition that the Tanners destroy all copies of the \"Church Handbook of Instructions\", and not include more than 50 words at a time from the handbook in any of their future articles.\nWikileaks has received copyright infringement claims from organizations including the Church of Scientology's Religious Technology Center and the Swiss Bank Julius Baer, and the Chinese government attempts to censor every website with the word \"wikileaks\" in the web page address. Bank Julius Baer sued Wikileaks after sending cease and desist letters in January 2008 which cited the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. As a result of the lawsuit, the bank obtained an injunction preventing the site's domain name registrar from associating with Wikileaks, but this injunction was lifted in March 2008 and Bank Julius Baer dropped the case.\nAs of May 13 Wikileaks had not taken down the material on the \"Church Handbook of Instructions\", and a second webpage at the site with a different version of the material was also still available. In a statement to \"Wikinews\", a Wikileaks representative commented on the material hosted at the site: \"WikiLeaks will not remove the handbooks, which are of substantial interest to current and former Mormons. WikiLeaks will remain a place where people from around the world can safely reveal the truth.\""}

The discussion, which is titled 'The World that Wikipedia Made,' was to be based on the online encyclopedia \"Wikipedia\" and ethics involved in the editing of the website. It is the ninth such meeting in a series on technology, ethics, and law and is taking place today.\nIn an e-mail to \"Wikinews\", Miriam Schulman the communications director for the Markkula Center for Applied Ethics at Santa Clara University which is to host the discussion, states that Mike Godwin, legal counsel for the Foundation, will not be speaking during the discussion as was originally planned. \nAccording to Schulman, Godwin canceled his scheduled appearance just one week ago and has decided not to have anyone from the foundation replace him. \"Valleywag\", a gossip website about technology, recently reported that Godwin was not attending due to a \"groundswell of criticism of Wikipedia\".\n\"I don't want to speak for Mr. Godwin or Wikimedia, but someone else made an incorrect assumption about this, so let me clarify that in our understanding, the problem was never with the composition of the panel. Mike Godwin, General Counsel of Wikimedia, was scheduled to participate in the panel, 'The World that Wikipedia Made,' on May 15. Last week, Mr. Godwin informed us that he would not participate, and subsequent discussions with Wikimedia Foundation indicated that they would not designate a replacement speaker,\" stated Schulman to \"Wikinews\".\n\"This is our ninth such panel (in addition to the hundreds of events on other topics our centers run each year), and we feel confident in our ability to set a respectful tone for discourse on controversial topics,\" added Schulman.\nSchulman would not comment on the reason for the Foundation's decision. \"Wikinews\" also attempted to contact Godwin, but was directed to Jay Walsh who is the head of communications for the Foundation, but \"Wikinews\" has not received a response.\nThe panel was to include Carl Hewitt an electrical and computer science engineer at Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Godwin discussing \"Wikipedia\" with Pedro Hern\u00e1ndez-Ramos, associate director for the Center for Science, Technology, and Society moderating the discussion. The plan was to discuss \"Wikipedia\", and what does and doesn't work for the encyclopedia.\n\"This panel will explore what works and what doesn't in the Wikipedia editing model from the angles of ethics, expertise, education, and the law,\" said a statement on the Center's website.\nSchulman states that the discussion, which is open to the public, is \"still planned\" for Thursday May 15 at 6:00 p.m. (pacific time) at the De Saisset Museum on the university's campus, but it is not yet known if anyone outside the Foundation will be replacing Godwin. The High Tech Law Institute along with the Ethics Center are sponsoring the discussion. Both individuals are still attending the discussion.\n\"These events are always open to the public, which means everyone is welcome. In this kind of setting, we invite anyone with an interest in the topic,\" stated Schulman to \"Wikinews\".\nThe Foundation is the parent organization of \"Wikipedia\" and other projects such as \"Wikinews\" and \"Wikimedia Commons\", a Wiki dedicated to hosting images that can be used throughout the projects of the Foundation."}

The \"Wall Street Journal\" has reported that the deal has been in various stages of development since October 2007 when the CEO of EDS, Ron Rittenmeyer, approached HP CEO Mark Hurd with a proposition to join forces. \nThis acquisition models a strong pattern of robust mergers and acquisitions activity since the arrival of current CEO Mr. Hurd. Since his arrival in 2005, HP has worked to expand their overall IT portfolio through organic research and development growth and the purchase of \"best of breed\" companies such as Mercury, Opsware and Peregrine.\nThis purchase will bolster the services arm of HP placing the company in second place worldwide behind IBM in terms of IT services. The added revenue will work to double Hewlett-Packard's sales from services to almost $40 billion, about as much as it gets from PCs. The combined forces of EDS and HP will represent a total worldwide workforce of 309,000 people in more than 80 countries representing 7% of the worldwide IT Service market. \nIn 2006 HP surpassed IBM as the largest technology company in the world in terms of overall revenue and since that time the two industry titans have fiercely battled for market dominance. Analysts at Briefing.com said: \"Adding EDS would expand HP's service offering and also increase its market share in the industry, helping it better compete with industry heavyweight IBM.\"\nLike any deal of this size it is not without its optimists and pessimists. From the positive side American Technology Research analyst Shaw Wu said. \"I am not saying this deal is a slam dunk by any means, but people have underestimated Mark Hurd before.\" \n\"EDS is more mature and more sophisticated in many of the processes that they bring to market than where we are\", Hurd, 51, told analysts on a conference call yesterday. \"We wouldn't do the deal if we didn't think we had an opportunity to improve the operating profit level that EDS currently has.\" \nA deal of this size provides a lot of potential for HP but it could also bring a lot of heartache for competitors other than IBM. For years, both Dell and Sun Microsystems have enjoyed preferred alliances with EDS selling expensive high-end servers to EDS customers. Xerox has also benefited by selling its printers and copiers through EDS, which is the most lucrative part of HP\u2019s business. \nDell in particular could be hurt the most. In recent years its PC business has lagged with declining sales and lost market share. Most of this market share was lost directly to HP. This buyout could deliver another major blow as last year; its sales to businesses were almost five times the revenue it received from consumers. With a major Dell partner now part of the competition that alliance will certainly be in question. "}

Local representatives from the NAACP and the Phoenix Anti-Defamation League attended the meeting, where local police met with area residents and concerned citizens to discuss the incident. Approximately 60 residents of Mesa attended the forum, which was hosted by the Mesa Police Department and held at the Mesa Public Safety Training Facility. \nLocal police investigated the attack, and arrested two teenagers. According to the police the two suspects ages 15 and 16 have carved swastikas into their skin on the inside of their wrists, and allegedly beat the Mormon teenagers and attacked them using pellet guns. According to a police report, one of the teens sustained golf-ball-size swelling and cuts to his face. One of the victims of the attack was transported to the hospital. Police said that the suspects made anti-Mormon statements during the attack.\nTerrea Arnwine, vice president of the East Valley NAACP, discussed the history of hate crimes and related the origins of his organization. \"I immediately spoke up when I heard about the incident with LDS,\" said Mesa police Chief George Gasc\u00f3n. LDS refers to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, also called the Mormon Church or LDS Church.\n\"This is America; this isn\u2019t supposed to happen here. This is the legacy we have been left with \u2014 unfortunately it is oftentimes not true,\" said Anti-Defamation League representative Bill Strauss. According to the Arizona Department of Public Safety, 254 incidents were reported in 2003 involving hate crimes, though Strauss said that the actual number of incidents could be higher due to underreporting. \nThe Gilbert Human Relations Commission also discussed the incident in a meeting Wednesday. \"It's an abysmal, and abominable occurrence, and yet it's extremely rare, and I think that speaks volumes of our community,\" said Patricia Krueger of the Human Relations Commission.\nDetective Terry Burchett of the Gilbert Police Department conducted interviews with 20 to 30 individuals as part of the investigation into the attack. According to police, a conflict arose between two groups of teenagers at a park in Gilbert, and some teenagers were asked by others if any in their group were Mormon. The victims later told police that they were attacked because they are Mormon. \nAccording to \"The Arizona Republic\", police are not yet certain that the attack should be considered a hate crime. Both teenagers have been charged with underage drinking, disorderly conduct and aggravated assault, and were booked into the Maricopa County Juvenile Detention Facility. According to \"KNXV-TV\" one of the suspects is a football player at Mesquite High School in Gilbert.\nThe parents of the victims spoke with \"KNXV-TV\" reporter Christina Boomer. The victims are ages 15 and 17. The parents of one of the victims said that their son's face was pushed into the gravel and that he sustained a fractured collarbone, and the father of the other victim said his son has a broken nose and fractured cheekbone from the attack, in addition to facial lacerations. \nOne of the teens' mothers stated: \"I broke down, I just, I couldn't believe the way he looked.\" \"No parents should see their kids in that kind of situation ... I don't believe that anybody should be persecuted for their beliefs or their faith,\" said the father of the same teenager. "}

The announcement of the listing was made by Interior Secretary Dirk Kempthorne. \nIn making the announcement, Kempthorne said he wishes to prevent further losses of polar bears, but he warned against using the Endangered Species Act to \"regulate greenhouse gas emissions from automobiles, power plants, and other sources\", which he called \"a wholly inappropriate use of the ESA law.\"\nKempthorne says the Interior Department will apply separate rules from the Marine Mammal Protection Act to the polar bear, which will permit flexibility in economic development as long as the survival of the species is not adversely affected. Kempthorne said the policies \"will ensure the protection of the bear while allowing us to continue to develop our natural resources in the Arctic region in an environmentally sound way.\"\nThe Government of Nunavut fears the decision could lead to a ban on the importation of polar bear hides into the United States. As a result the Nunavut economy could suffer. The polar bear hunt generates $1.5 million (US) per year in revenue.\nCarl Pope, director of the environmentalist Sierra Club, criticized the Interior Department's decision, saying it was \"riddled with loopholes, caveats and backhanded language that could actually undermine protections for the polar bear and other species\".\nThe government was forced to make a decision regarding the polar bear by May 15, after environmental groups sued the George W. Bush administration for failing to meet a January 9 deadline. The administration was accused of postponing the decision as a way to allow for more Alaskan oil and gas drilling.\nThe purpose of the Endangered Species Act is to protect species that may be in danger of extinction as a result of human action. It aims to achieve this by regulating federal activity in the habitat of threatened species. Commercial activity is not directly regulated, but companies must receive a permit for development in designated habitats.\nThe polar bear is the first animal to be protected under the Endangered Species Act due to the threat that global warming poses to the bears' Arctic habitat. Some environmental groups say they could use the designation to protest the construction of coal power plants located thousands of miles away from the Arctic, which they blame for contributing to greenhouse gases and global warming.\nHowever, Barton H. Thompson Jr., a law professor at Stanford University, says that such lawsuits would be difficult to win. \"Interior has a reasonable case here that the connection [between greenhouse gas emmissions and polar bears] is just too far removed,\" he says. \nIf sea ice continues to melt, two-thirds of the polar bear population could be gone by 2050, according to studies released by the United States Geological Survey last September. Also, Louis Fortier of the Canadian research group ArcticNet believes the Arctic Ocean could be ice-free in the summers by 2010.\nBut M. Reed Hopper of the Pacific Legal Foundation, a property-rights group, disputes the notion that the polar bear is severely threatened. He says the government used \"speculative computer modeling\" to make its decision, and he plans to sue the Interior Department. \"Never before has a thriving species been listed under the Environmental Species Act, nor should it be,\" he said."}

At the rally, Edwards addressed Obama's supporters. \n\"The Democratic voters in America have made their choice and so have I,\" he told a crowd of cheering supporters.\n\"There is one man who knows and understands that this is a time for bold leadership...there is one man who knows in his heart that it is time to create one America, not two - and that man is Barack Obama.\" \nThe endorsement comes the day after Clinton defeated Obama by more than 2-to-1 in West Virginia's primary. Edwards received 7% of the vote despite having suspended his campaign in January.\nBoth Obama and Clinton immediately asked Edwards for his endorsement, but he stayed mum for more than four months. A person close to Edwards, speaking on condition of anonymity, said he wanted to get involved now to begin unifying the party. Obama also signed on to Edwards' poverty initiative, which was a major cause for Edwards in his campaign and since he left. When Edwards suspended his campaign, he asked both Obama and Clinton to make poverty a central issue in the general election and a future Democratic administration, something both agreed to do.\nWhen he made his decision, Edwards didn't even tell many of his former top advisers because he wanted to make sure that he personally talked to Clinton to give her the news, said a person close to him. Edwards' wife, Elizabeth, who has spoken favorably about Clinton's health care plan, did not travel with him to Michigan and is not part of the endorsement.\nClinton campaign chairman Terry McAuliffe said Wednesday that \"We respect John Edwards, but as the voters of West Virginia showed last night, this thing is far from over.\"\nAccording to latest estimates, Barack Obama has a total of 1,887 delegates in CNN's count and 1,884 in the Associated Press's count. Both tallies have Clinton trailing Obama with 1,718 delegates. Obama needs just 139 delegates to reach the 2,026 necessary to clinch the party's nomination.\nEdwards, meanwhile, has 19 total pledged delegates who may or may not pledge their support for Obama at the Democratic National Committee's August convention in Denver, Colorado.\nEdwards, who is not a superdelegate, said last week that it was \"fine\" for Clinton to continue making her case, but expressed concern that a continued campaign could damage the party's prospects in November.\nWednesday's endorsement could help Obama reach out to white blue-collar voters, a demographic that Obama has failed to capture, most notably in the recent Pennsylvania and West Virginia primaries. Some political pundits predicted that Edwards' supporters are more likely to lean in Obama's direction.\n\"The conventional wisdom is that Barack Obama will pick up maybe 60 percent of them, and in some places, that makes a huge difference,\" former presidential adviser David Gergen said in January."}

According to \"Xinhua News Agency\", Beijing Health Bureau spokeswoman Deng Xiaohong said that the 13-month-old boy died Sunday while en route to the hospital. Health authorities state that 24,934 children in mainland China are afflicted with the disease, and 42 children have died from it. The cause of the disease has been identified as Enterovirus 71 (EV-71). HFMD can also be caused by Coxsackievirus.\nAnother child infected with the virus died Monday, but as he died in Hebei province his death was counted there. \"Xinhua News Agency\" also reported that a 21-month-old boy died Monday of the virus in Hubei province. After an order was given last week by the Ministry of Health of the People's Republic of China that all cases must be reported, the count of those infected has increased markedly. \nEastern China saw a large number of cases in early March, but this information was not made public until late April. In March, Children under age six in eastern Anhui province began being admitted to hospitals with symptoms of the virus, and the outbreak spread quickly after that. The city of Fuyang in Anhui province was especially hard-hit by the outbreak. \"The majority of patients who were in critical condition have recovered,\" said a Health Ministry official in a statement on Monday. As of Monday, 3,606 HFMD infections had been reported in Beijing. Deaths have occurred in the provinces of Anhui, Guangdong, Guangxi, Hainan, Hunan, Zhejiang, Beijing and Hubei.\n\"What I know is the death rate has gone down drastically since early May. There are very, very few cases with complications \u2014 99 percent of these are mild cases,\" said World Health Organization (WHO) China representative Hans Troedsson in a statement on Wednesday. Incidents of the disease are expected to peak in June and July.\nChildren with mild cases of the disease generally recover rapidly after manifesting a rash and a fever. Other symptoms include diarrhea, cold-like symptoms, and sores on the extremities and mouth. In severe cases, fluid may accumulate in the brain, and result in meningitis, encephalitis, pulmonary edema, paralysis and death. The EV-71 virus is spread through contact with fluid secreted from blisters, nose and throat mucus, feces and saliva. There is no specific treatment or vaccine for the virus. The disease is unrelated to foot-and-mouth disease, which affects livestock.\nUnited States Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Mike Leavitt was visiting in the country, and said in a statement Monday in Shanghai that the U.S. is assisting China fight the outbreak. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), a division of the Department of Health and Human Services, symptomatic treatment can be given to address possible fever and aches and pains. The CDC advises children and adults to practice proper hand washing technique, and to wash and disinfect contaminated items and surfaces using diluted solution of chlorine-containing bleach.\nChina is also dealing with a magnitude-7.9 earthquake which hit the country Monday and has killed almost 15,000. The outbreak is a concern to the government, as the country prepares for the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing this August. \"We are confident the potential outbreak will not affect the Beijing Olympic Games,\" China's Health Ministry spokesman Mao Qunan stated. And at a joint press conference held by China's Ministry of Health and the WHO, he further noted that, \"China is confident that it can control the spread of the disease with effective prevention methods.\""}

We need this in the long run. This would simply make our connections locally better and it would also help in timetable coordination with the connecting flights... People would not fly to only where we fly. They would like to fly to other destinations as well, within India. So we would need a local partner to cooperate,\u201d said Hienonen, who refused to name any of the airlines involved.\nFinnair launched services to India in 2006 and will soon step up to thirteen flights a week there, with daily flights from New Delhi and six-days-a-week from Mumbai. There are plans to also fly from Bangalore or Chennai within two to three years.\nFinnair is a member of Oneworld Alliance, which is the world's third-largest airline alliance and includes members such as British Airways, American Airlines, Qantas and Japan Airlines and other major international airlines. Hienonen explained that he wished the alliance to include an Indian airline, saying \"I have also been urging the board of Oneworld that we should have an Indian partner as well. That is also in the process at the moment. So ideally, we may partner the same airline.\u201d\nThe airline has seen rapid sales growth since beginning services in India. Finnair believes that there is significant potential to serve business travellers due to good commercial links between the countries. Around 70 major Finnish companies including mobile phone manufacturer Nokia and engineering giant KONE have plans for large-scale expansion in India and employ as many as 11,000 Indians, while Infosys, Sasken and Wipro and other large Indian software companies are set to begin operations in Finland.\nAlso discussed were related fleet modernisation plans. \"By the first quarter of 2010, we would be phasing out all our Boeing MD-11s [the MD-11 is sometime considered a Boeing after the company bought out McDonnell Douglas] and they would be replaced by Airbus A340s and A330s... Airbus 330s are best for shorter routes. We will have five of them by the first half of next year and they will be primarily for the Indian traffic,\" stated Hienonen, explaining that the older airliners have greater fuel consumptions. High fuel costs have caused a number of airline shutdowns in recent years.\nFinnair, currently in its 85th year, is one of the world's oldest airlines still conducting operations. The company flew 8.6 million passengers in 2007, 1.2 million of whom were on the airline's Asian routes. Last year saw a two billion Euro turnover, and the firm employs 9,500 people worldwide."}

The decision struck down two laws, one from 1977 and another more recent one due to a referendum in 2000. Prior to this case, California allowed extensive benefits to gay couples that were in practice close to those given to heterosexual couples. \nThe case in question consisted of a consolidation of six cases being appealed. Parties included a variety of gay couples and the city of San Francisco which wanted to recognize gay couples.\nThe opinion, written by Chief Justice Ronald M. George, stated that that there was no legitimate basis to discriminate based on sexual preference. Moreover, the court found that the laws were unconstitutional given the protections of the California Constitution. The opinion was also signed by Justices, Kathryn Werdegar, and Carlos Moreno and Justice Joyce Kennard who also wrote an additional concurrence. Justice Marvin Baxter wrote dissent also signed by Justice Ming Chin. Finally, Justice Carol Corrigan wrote a dissent saying that although she personally favored gay marriage the people of California clearly had not and the popular will should not be overruled by the court.\nSupporters of gay marriage said the ruling was a milestone. \"This decision will give Americans the lived experience that ending exclusion from marriage helps families and harms no one,\" said Evan Wolfson, executive director of Freedom to Marry, who noted that same-sex marriages are now legal in South Africa, Canada, Spain, Belgium and the Netherlands.\nJames Dobson, head of the conservative Christian organization Focus on the Family called the ruling an outrage and called on the people of California to pass a constitutional amendment barring gay marriage saying that \"Only then can they protect themselves from this latest example of judicial tyranny.\"\nEdward Zelinsky of Yeshiva University, whose work was cited in the brief of California's attorney general supporting the law, characterized the court's opinion as \"problematic in important respects.\" He criticized the court for failing to explain adequately why its logic does not apply to other non-traditional forms of marriage such as polygamy.\nSince the decision is based upon the California Constitution, it cannot be appealed to the Supreme Court of the United States.\nCurrently in the United States different states have taken different positions. Although a variety of states allow civil unions, at present only Massachusetts has legalized gay marriage. State courts have disagreed as to whether gay couples should be treated like heterosexual couples."}

OpenSSL is one of the most used cryptographic software, that allows the creation of secure network connections with the protocols called SSL and TLS. It is included in many popular computer programs, like the Mozilla Firefox web browser and the Apache web server. Debian is one of the most used GNU/Linux distributions, on which are based other distributions, like Ubuntu and Knoppix. The problem affects all the Debian-based distributions that were used to create cryptographic keys since the . The bug was discovered by Luciano Bello, an argentine Debian package maintainer, and was announced on .\nThis vulnerability was caused by the removal of two lines of code from the original version of the OpenSSL library. These lines were used to gather some entropy data by the library, needed to seed the PRNG used to create private keys, on which the secure connections are based. Without this entropy, the only dynamic data used was the PID of the software. Under Linux the PID can be a number between 1 and 32,768, that is a too small range of values if used to seed the PRNG and will cause the generation of predictable numbers. Therefore any key generated can be predictable, with only 32,767 possible keys for a given architecture and key length, and the secrecy of the network connections created with those keys is fully compromised.\nThese lines were removed as \"suggested\" by two audit tools (Valgrind and Purify) used to find vulnerabilities in the software distributed by Debian. These tools warned the Debian maintainers that some data was used before its initialization, that normally can lead to a security bug, but this time it was not the case, as the OpenSSL developers wrote on March 13, 2003. Anyway this change was erroneously applied on September 17, 2006, when the OpenSSL Debian version 0.9.8c-1 was released to the public. \nEven though the Debian maintainer responsible for this software released a patch to fix this bug on , the impact may be severe. In fact OpenSSL is commonly used in software to protect the passwords, to offer privacy and security. Any private key created with this version of OpenSSL is weak and must be replaced, included the session keys that are created and used only temporary. This means that any data encrypted with these keys can be decrypted without a big deal, even if these keys are used (but not created) with a version of the library not affected, like the ones included in other operating systems.\nFor example any web server running under any operating system may use a weak key created on a vulnerable Debian-based system. Any encrypted connection (HTTPS) to this web server established by any browser can be decrypted. This may be a serious problem for sites that requires a secure connection, like banks or private web sites. Also, if some encrypted connection was recorded in the past, it can be decrypted in the same way.\nAnother serious problem is for the network security software, like OpenSSH and OpenVPN, that are used to encrypt the traffic to protect passwords and grant the access to an administrative console or a private network protected by firewalls. This may allows hackers to gain unwanted access to private computers, networks or data traveled over the network, even if a not affected version of OpenSSL was used.\nThe same behavior can be applied to any software or protocol that use SSL, like POP3S, SSMTP, FTPS, if used with a weak key. This is the case of Tor, software used to offer strong anonymity on the TCP/IP, where about 300 of 1,500-2,000 nodes used a weak key. With 15-20% of weak Tor nodes, there is a probability of 0.34-0.8% circa to build a circuit that has all tree nodes weak, resulting in a full loss of anonymity. Also the case of only one weak node begin used may facilitate some types of attack to the anonymity. The Tor \"hidden services\", a sort of anonymous public servers, are affected too. However the issue was speedily addressed on May 14, 2008.\nThe same problem also interested anonymous remailers like Mixmaster and Mixminion, that use OpenSSL to create the remailer keys for the servers and the nym keys for the clients. Although currently there is no official announcement, at least two remailer changed their keys because were weak."}

According to the Saint Martin newspaper \"The Daily Herald\" and the shipping news journal \"Lloyd's List\", the \"Freewinds\" was sealed in April and local public health officials on the Caribbean island of Cura\u00e7ao where the ship is docked began an investigation into the presence of asbestos dust on the ship. Former Scientologist Lawrence Woodcraft supervised work on the ship in 1987, and attested to the presence of blue asbestos on the \"Freewinds\" in an affidavit posted to the Internet in 2001. Woodcraft, a licensed architect by profession, gave a statement to \"Wikinews\" and commented on the recent events.\nAccording to \"The Daily Herald\", the \"Freewinds\" was in the process of being renovated by the Cura\u00e7ao Drydock Company. The article states that samples taken from paneling in the ship were sent to the Netherlands, where an analysis revealed that they \"contained significant levels of blue asbestos\". An employee of the Cura\u00e7ao Drydock Company told \"Radar Online\" in an April 30 article that the \"Freewinds\" has been docked and sealed, and confirmed that an article about asbestos ran in the local paper. \n\"Lloyd's List\" reported that work on the interior of the \"Freewinds\" was suspended on April 27 after health inspectors found traces of blue asbestos on the ship. According to \"Lloyd's List\", Frank Esser, Cura\u00e7ao Drydock Company's interim director, joined Cura\u00e7ao's head of the department of labor affairs Christiene van der Biezen along with the head of the local health department Tico Ras and two inspectors in an April 25 inspection of the ship. \"We are sending someone so that they can tell us what happened, where it came from, since when it has been there,\" said Panama Maritime Authority's director of merchant marine Alfonso Castillero in a statement to \"Lloyd's List\".\nThe Church of Scientology purchased the ship, then known as the \"Boh\u00e8me\", in 1987, through an organization called Flag Ship Trust. After being renovated and refitted, it was put into service in June 1988. The ship is used by the Church of Scientology for advanced Scientology training in \"Operating Thetan\" levels, as well as for spiritual retreats for its members. Cura\u00e7ao has been the ship's homeport since it was purchased by the Church of Scientology. \nAccording to his 2001 statement, Lawrence Woodcraft had been an architect in London, England since 1975, and joined Scientology's elite \"Sea Organization\" (Sea Org) in 1986. He wrote that he was asked by the Sea Org to work on the \"Freewinds\" in 1987, and during his work on the ship \"noticed a powdery blue fibrous substance approximately 1 \u00bd\" thick between the paint and the steel wall,\" which he believed to be asbestos. He also discovered what he thought was blue asbestos in other parts of the ship, and reported his findings to Church of Scientology executives. Woodcraft discussed his experiences in a 2001 interview published online by the Lisa McPherson Trust, a now-defunct organization which was critical of the Church of Scientology.\nChurch of Scientology spokeswoman Karin Pouw responded to \"Radar Online\" about the asbestos reports, in an email published in an article in \"Radar\" on May 1. \"The Freewinds regularly inspects the air quality on board and always meets or exceeds US standards,\" said Pouw. She stated that two inspections performed in April \"confirmed that the air quality is safe,\" and asserted that the inspections revealed the \"Freewinds\" satisfies standards set by the United States Occupational Safety and Health Administration and the U.S. Clean Air Act. \nPouw told \"Radar\" that \"The Freewinds will be completing its refit on schedule.\" The Church of Scientology-affiliated organization Citizens Commission on Human Rights (CCHR) had been planning a cruise aboard the \"Freewinds\" scheduled for May 8, but according to \"Radar\" an individual who called the booking number for the cruise received a message that the cruise had been delayed due to ongoing work on the ship. Citing an article in the Netherlands Antilles newspaper \"Amigoe\", \"Radar\" reported on May 6 that a team from the United States and supervised by an independent bureau from the Netherlands traveled to Cura\u00e7ao in order to remove asbestos from the \"Freewinds\". \n\"I stand by everything I wrote in my 2001 affidavit,\" said Lawrence Woodcraft in an exclusive statement given to \"Wikinews\". Woodcraft went on to state: \"I would also comment that if the Church of Scientology claims to have removed the blue asbestos, I just don't see how, it's everywhere. You would first have to remove all the pipes, plumbing, a/c ducts, electrical wiring etc. etc. just a maze of stuff. Also panelling as well, basically strip the ship back to a steel hull. Also blue asbestos is sprayed onto the outer walls and then covered in paint. It's in every nook and cranny.\"\nMany Scientologist celebrities have spent time aboard the \"Freewinds\", including Tom Cruise, Katie Holmes, John Travolta, Kelly Preston, Chick Corea, Lisa Marie Presley, Catherine Bell, Kate Ceberano, and Juliette Lewis. \"Now magazine\" reported that Tom Cruise has been urged to seek medical attention regarding potential asbestos exposure, however a representative for Cruise stated he has \"absolutely no knowledge\" of the recent asbestos controversy. Cruise, Holmes, Travolta and Preston have celebrated birthdays and other events on the \"Freewinds\".\nIn a May 15 statement to the United Kingdom daily newspaper \"Metro\", a representative for the Church of Scientology said that \"There is not now and never has been a situation of asbestos exposure on the Freewinds.\" The Asbestos and Mesothelioma Center notes that agencies have recommended anyone who has spent time on the \"Freewinds\" consult with their physician to determine if possible asbestos exposure may have affected their health.\nRaw blue asbestos is the most hazardous form of asbestos, and has been banned in the United Kingdom since 1970. Blue asbestos fibers are very narrow and thus easily inhaled, and are a major cause of mesothelioma. Mesothelioma is a form of cancer which can develop in the lining of the lungs and chest cavity, the lining of the abdominal cavity, or the pericardium sac surrounding the heart. The cancer is incurable, and can manifest over 40 years after the initial exposure to asbestos. \n\"This is the most dangerous type of asbestos because the fibres are smaller than the white asbestos and can penetrate the lung more easily,\" said toxicologist Dr. Chris Coggins in a statement published in \"OK! Magazine\". Dr. Coggins went on to note that \"Once diagnosed with mesothelioma, the victim has six months to a year to live. It gradually reduces lung function until the victim is no longer able to breathe and dies.\""}

At least 10,000 people died just in Bogale Township in the Pyapon District of the country.\nThe United Nations has reported that 2.5 million people are homeless, or in need of help in the Irrawaddy Delta.\nThe military junta that governs the country says that it can handle relief operations and that they are going well. It is still turning down international offers to transport aid directly to the affected areas. According to state television, Prime Minister Thein Sein said, \"We have already finished our first phase of emergency relief. We are going onto the second phase, the rebuilding stage.\"\n\"Time is life,\" said Louis Michel, the European Commissioner for Development &amp; Humanitarian Aid to reporters at Bangkok International Airport in Thailand. \"No government in the world can tackle such a problem alone. This is a major catastrophe.\"\nMichel was returning from a trip to Yangon where he was unsuccessful at urging the junta to allow direct aid despite its pride and paranoia about the outside world.\nAid groups, including UN agencies, say only a fraction of the required relief is getting through and, unless the situation improves, thousands more lives are at risk.\nAccording to \"The New York Times\", the United States and some European allies had considered a United Nations Security Council resolution calling for \"humanitarian intervention\" in Myanmar, which would give authorization for a relief mission without approval of the military authorities in Myanmar. The idea was dismissed after it became clear that China would veto any such resolution. \nThe US has a assembled number of ships, helicopters, transport airplanes and marines in the region, ready to assist in cyclone relief if given approval by the government of Myanmar. US officials say that helicopters can bring in assistance to areas inland from the coast and further help distribute supplies across the country. Myanmar has approved fewer than 20 cargo planes to bring supplies to the capital, Yangon.\nAt the United Nations Headquarters, a row occurred when Myanmar's ambassador to the UN, Kyaw Tint Swe, interrupted the French ambassador Jean-Maurice Ripert during a speech to the General Assembly. He accused France of sending a warship to Myanmar.\n\"It's not true,\" Ripert said. While the ship is operated by the French Navy, it is not a warship but a ship carrying 1500 tonnes of food and medicine, Ripert insisted. It also has small boats to reach the flooded Irrawaddy Delta. The ship will reach the coast of Myanmar on Saturday, awaiting approval to deliver aid.\nMeanwhile, the UN is sending John Holmes, the Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator, to make contact with Myanmar's reclusive military leaders to improve UN access to the hardest-hit areas.\nAccording to UN spokesperson, Mich\u00e8le Montas, Holmes will arrive in Myanmar on Sunday. He will be carrying a letter from Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon to Senior General Than Shwe, who has twice previously refused to converse with Ban."}

The guards walked off the job after the Occupational Health and Safety Committee at the facility was made aware of the situation. \nJoan Jessome, president of the Nova Scotia Government and General Employees Union, told \"The Canadian Press\" that the guards refused to show up for their Thursday night shift, and did not show up for work on Friday. Jessome stated that the guards's refusal to work is permitted under the provincial Occupational Health and Safety Act. \"What they've done is not a work stoppage. What they've done is exercise their right to refuse to do the work because they believe it's unsafe,\" said Jessome.\nThe issue of asbestos in the facility was raised months ago, and an April 25 inspection found that the asbestos was properly labeled to prevent staff from accidental exposure. \nThe location is undergoing testing, however preliminary results show that the levels of asbestos in the facility are within safe limits. Air testing conducted on May 8 in the facility did not show traces of the carcinogenic material.\nThe Department of Justice stated in a press release Friday that the Royal Canadian Mounted Police will be providing emergency staffing to the correctional facility as needed, and that new inmates will be sent to one of the four other correctional facilities in Nova Scotia. \nSheri Aikenhead, a spokeswoman for the provincial Justice Department, talked to \"The Canadian Press\": \"At the moment we're satisfied that managers are safely managing the situation there. If the RCMP are required, they will be called upon.\" Aikenhead said that an inmate had complained about the possibility of the presence of asbestos this past March.\nThe Cape Breton Correctional Facility is a provincial jail which houses 76 inmates. The facility is 33-years old, and asbestos was used in construction as a fire retardant. If asbestos fibers are disturbed and inhaled they can lead to lung scarring and lung cancer."}

The plaintiffs hail from the Japanese prefectures of Tokyo, Saitama and Chiba.\nThe plaintiffs claim that the government and manufacturers knew of the dangers of asbestos inhalation but failed to take proper precautions, including ceasing to promote asbestos as a cheap fire retardant and banning production of the material. \nThey state that after inhaling asbestos in the workplace, 172 people have developed lung cancer or mesothelioma, and that almost half of those afflicted are now dead. Plaintiffs argue that the government and health ministry did not act quickly enough after international organizations issued warnings in 1972 that asbestos could be a carcinogen. \nPlaintiffs also place blame with the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry for sanctioning the use of asbestos under Japanese Industrial Standards, and with the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport for approving the use of materials comprised of asbestos and other substances under Japan's Building Standards Law.\n\"We will do our utmost until we win the suit,\" said Kazuo Miyajima, 78, who heads the group of plaintiffs. Lawyers for the plaintiffs released a statement saying: \"We seek complete relief for the victims by clarifying the liability of the state and the manufacturers.\"\nApproximately 40 construction workers from Kanagawa Prefecture plan to file a similar lawsuit in June in Yokohama District Court.\nAfter a 2005 revelation that residents who lived near a factory in Amagasaki, Hyogo Prefecture developed diseases related to asbestos, the government implemented a law in 2006 which provides monetary assistance to asbestos victims and relatives of deceased family members. The plaintiffs argue that the amount of financial assistance given to families and victims of asbestos-related diseases is not sufficient.\nAsbestos has been used in Japan as a fire retardant, for sound absorption, and for insulation. It was mixed in concrete and water and sprayed on walls and ceilings, but the practice of spraying asbestos in this manner was banned in Japan in 1975. "}

The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says that no one has ever contracted HIV from saliva, and a gay-rights and AIDS advocacy group called the sentence excessive.\nA Dallas County jury concluded that Willie Campbell's act of spitting on policeman Dan Waller in 2006 constituted the use of his saliva as a deadly weapon. The incident occurred while Campbell, 42, was resisting arrest while being taken into custody for public intoxication.\n\"He turns and spits. He hits me in the eye and mouth. Then he told me he has AIDS. I immediately began looking for something to flush my eyes with,\" said Waller to \"The Dallas Morning News\". \nOfficer Waller responded after a bystander reported seeing an unconscious male lying outside a building. Dallas County prosecutors stated that Campbell attempted to fight paramedics and kicked the police officer who arrested him for public intoxication. \nProsecutors said that Campbell yelled that he was innocent during the trial, and claimed a police officer was lying. Campbell's lawyer Russell Heinrichs said that because he had a history of convictions including similarly attacking two other police officers, biting inmates, and other offenses, he was indicted under a habitual offender statute. The statute increased his minimum sentence to 25 years in prison. Because the jury ruled that Campbell's saliva was used as a deadly weapon, he will not be eligible for parole until completing at least half his sentence. \nThe organization Lambda Legal (Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund), which advocates for individuals living with HIV, says that saliva should not be considered a deadly weapon. Bebe Anderson, the HIV projects director at Lambda Legal, spoke with \"The Dallas Morning News\" about the sentence. \"It's been 25 years since the virus was identified, but there are still lots of fears,\" said Anderson. \nThe Dallas County prosecutor who handled the trial, Jenni Morse, said that the deadly weapon finding was justified. \"No matter how minuscule, there is some risk. That means there is the possibility of causing serious bodily injury or death,\" said Morse. Dallas County District Attorney Craig Watkins stated: \"If you look at the facts of this case, it was clear that the defendant intended to cause serious bodily injury.\"\nA page at the CDC's website, \"HIV and Its Transmission\", states: \"HIV has been found in saliva and tears in very low quantities from some AIDS patients.\" The subsection \"Saliva, Tears, and Sweat\" concludes that: \"Contact with saliva, tears, or sweat has never been shown to result in transmission of HIV.\" On Friday the Dallas County Health Department released a statement explaining that HIV is most commonly spread through sexual contact, sharing needles, or transfusion from an infected blood product."}

Interfax quoted authorities who said that fumes from the corpses in the cave threatened the nine remaining members of the group with poisoning and intoxication. Members entered the cave in November 2007 under instruction from their leader Pyotr Kuznetsov, and were under the belief that the world was coming to an end in May of this year.\nThirty-five members of the group entered the underground cave, 650km (400 miles) south-east of Moscow, in November in order to wait for the end of the world. The group members threatened mass suicide by igniting gasoline canisters if authorities attempted to intervene and remove them. \nWhen Russian Orthodox priests were brought in to negotiate in November, the group members refused to speak with them. The group's leader Kuznetsov, a trained engineer, instructed his followers not to listen to the radio or watch television. True Orthodox Church is a splinter group of the Russian Orthodox Church. Members believe that bar codes are Satanic symbols and refuse to eat processed food.\nIn November Kuznetsov, 43, was arrested and charged with setting up a religious organization associated with violence. In March, Kuznetsov attempted to commit suicide by banging his head with a log, after the spiritual leader realized he was wrong about his prophecy of apocalypse. After undergoing a psychiatric evaluation, Kuznetsov was determined to be schizophrenic. \"It was an attempted suicide.

Both of their bodies were buried in a hole in the cave. Emergency workers discovered the bodies while trying to shore up supports in the cave which previously underwent partial cave-ins due to melting snow. The bodies of the two dead women were exhumed after the nine members of the group left the cave, and forensic tests were conducted on the bodies.\n\"We could smell the stench through ventilation holes. As we pulled out the dead bodies, we suggested the others leave and they agreed,\" said local official Vladimir Provotorov in a statement quoted by Interfax. Provotorov said authorities believed the remaining members of the group would be poisoned by the toxic fumes of the decomposing bodies of the two dead females. There was \"a real threat of poisoning from toxic corpse fumes,\" said Provotorov. Oleg Melnichenko said the stench of the corpses drove the remaining members out of the cave. According to the \"International Herald Tribune\", the Penza regional Prosecutor General's Office confirmed the Interfax report.\nA physician is examining the eight women and one man that emerged from the cave on Friday, and prosecutor's office spokeswoman Tatyana Ostrovskaya said authorities are in the process of deciding whether or not to pursue criminal charges related to the two dead women. \"We are examining the bodies to see if we will open a criminal case,\" said Ostrovskaya. The majority of the members of the True Russian Orthodox Church still believe that the world will soon end, and await the apocalypse in the village of Nikolskoye in a cottage owned by their leader Kuznetsov."}

The verdict signals that there may be trouble ahead for two of the party\u2019s leaders who are also on trial.\nSamoobrona (Self-Defence) rural protest party official Jacek Popecki was sentenced to 28 months in jail for giving a woman, who had accused his party\u2019s boss of fathering her child, drugs to induce a miscarriage.\nIn late 2006, Aneta Krawczyk accused the party\u2019s leader Andrzej Lepper of having offered her political favours for sex in 2001, and then said he had been the father of her youngest child. She said the same of Lepper\u2019s close collaborator and MP, Stanis\u0142aw \u0141y\u017cwi\u0144ski, and accused him of rape and sexual abuse.

Renaissance Middle School, part of the Montclair Public Schools in New Jersey, was closed Monday and remains closed Tuesday while undergoing asbestos testing and cleaning.\nAccording to a letter sent home to parents by the Superintendent's Office of Montclair Public Schools on Friday, \"plaster may have been disturbed\" during construction on new fire doors at the Renaissance School building on Thursday. \nAn inspection arranged by the school district indicated asbestos was present in the plaster, and a subsequent inspection performed by asbestos consultant Detail Associates revealed \"a level of airborne asbestos fibers that exceeded the acceptable range\" in the third floor hallway of the school. Montclair Public Schools business administrator Dana Sullivan told \"The Star-Ledger\" that testing conducted on March 31 revealed the presence of asbestos in a brown undercoating of plaster at the Renaissance School building.\nThe affected area was sealed off, and some students were moved to other areas of the building while others were moved to off-site locations. District Public Information Officer Laura Federico told \"The Montclair Times\" that sixth and seventh graders were transported to Hillside Elementary School, and eighth graders were bussed to Montclair High School. \"The safety of our students and staff is always our first concern,\" said Federico.\nAccording to \"The Montclair Times\", Detail Associates conducted a cleaning protocol at the school on Saturday and tested the building to make sure it did not contain unacceptable levels of asbestos fibers. The letter sent to parents Friday by the Superintendent's Office said that Detail Associates had told the district that the building would be \"cleaned, tested and cleared for occupancy by Monday morning\". The school remained closed Monday, and a meeting was held between parents and school district officials. A Parent-Teacher Association meeting is planned for Wednesday night. \n\"The Star-Ledger\" reported that the ongoing asbestos cleanup of the school is being supervised by the state Department of Environmental Protection. At the meeting Monday morning between parents and school district officials, parents demanded that the inside of lockers be included as part of the asbestos cleanup. This additional step in the asbestos inspection process prompted the school's closure Tuesday. A Monday statement by the Business Office of Montclair Public Schools said that the Renaissance School would remain closed Tuesday for sixth and seventh grade students \"so that an extensive cleanup and additional asbestos testing can be completed\". Eighth grade students did not have classes scheduled as a trip to Washington, D.C. had previously been planned; the school trip is unaffected by the recent asbestos incident.\nSteve Jaraczewski of Detail Associates was present at the district meeting Monday, and said that one of four test samples taken at the school was positive for the presence of airborne asbestos at over six times acceptable levels. Jaraczewski was critical of the asbestos management plan provided by Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Newark, which owns the school's building and leases it to Montclair Public Schools. \nJaraczewski said that the state Department of Environmental Protection has required asbestos management plans since 1988, but that the company that drafted the asbestos plan for the Archdiocese of Newark is out of business. Representative for the archdiocese Jim Goodness emphasized that the building would be back open for classes soon. \"The kids will be able to go back to school soon, and that's the important part,\" said Goodness.\nExposure to airborne asbestos can lead to mesothelioma, a cancer which develops in the sac surrounding the lungs and chest cavity, abdominal cavity, or the sac surrounding the heart. Exposure to disturbed asbestos fibers can also lead to lung scarring, a condition called asbestosis, and lung cancer. Patients with malignant mesothelioma generally do not have positive outcomes, and once diagnosed have six months to a year to live."}

He has had no further seizures, remains in good overall condition, and is up and walking around the hospital.\" \nThe statement went on to say, \"However, preliminary results from a biopsy of the brain identified the cause of the seizure as a malignant glioma in the left parietal lobe. The usual course of treatment includes combinations of various forms of radiation and chemotherapy.\" \nThe statement finished by saying, \"Decisions regarding the best course of treatment for Senator Kennedy will be determined after further testing and analysis. Senator Kennedy will remain at Massachusetts General Hospital for the next couple of days according to routine protocol. He remains in good spirits and full of energy.\"\nReactions.\nVarious Senate colleagues and other politicians have reacted to the announcement.\nJohn Kerry, the junior senator from Massachusetts and fellow colleague noted, \"We are pulling for our pal, and I know he is determined to fight this.\" \nKerry also released a statement from his office saying, \"Now, everybody needs to pull together on behalf of Ted. We must pull for him and his family and remember that Teddy is one unbelievable fighter,\" and noting that \"Over the weekend, I saw him and he\u2019s in a fighting mood.\" \nKerry finished by stating, \"I know that Ted is determined to fight this because he wants to continue his fight for the people of Massachusetts and he wants to continue to fight for everything that he believes in here in the United States Senate and throughout our country.\"\nChristopher Dodd, the Democratic senator from Connecticut and one of Kennedy's closest friends, joined Kerry along with Senate Majority Leader, Harry Reid and said of Kennedy, \"He's a strong guy and has great heart and we're confident he'll be back here.\"\nHarry Reid, the Democratic Senate Majority Leader from Nevada said, \"He knows how we feel about him, without our even telling him. ... And so we stand as a body, and as certainly a Democratic family, with our affection, our love and our prayers with Senator Ted Kennedy.\"\nBob Kerrey, the former Democratic senator for Nebraska, recently said that Ted Kennedy is \"the one politician who brings tears to my eyes when he speaks.\" \n\"I am so deeply saddened I have lost the words,\" said John Warner, the Republican senator from Virginia.\nSenator Robert Byrd from West Virginia wept on the Senate floor as he said, \"Ted, Ted, Ted.

And we want to make sure that he's fighting this illness. And it's our job now to support him in the way that he has supported us for so many years. He's not just a great senator, he is a great friend. He is beloved by me, and beloved by my colleagues,\" said Barack Obama, the Senator from Illinois and one of the two Democratic candidates for President. \nKennedy threw his support behind Obama and endorsed him back in January right before Super Tuesday.\nHillary Clinton, the other Democratic candidate for President and New York's junior senator said, \"Ted Kennedy's courage and resolve are unmatched, and they have made him one of the greatest legislators in Senate history.

He was the brother of American President John F. Kennedy and U.S. Senator Robert F. Kennedy.\nOn May 20, 2008, Kennedy was diagnosed with a brain tumor, and was released from Massachusetts General Hospital on May 21.\nHe was born Edward Moore Kennedy on February 22, 1932, in Boston. He had been a senator since 1962.\nKennedy is survived by his wife Victoria Reggie Kennedy, three children, two step-children, a sister \u2014 Jean Kennedy Smith, many nieces and nephews and several grandchildren.\nThe Kennedy family released a statement saying, \"Edward M.

He loved this country and devoted his life to serving it. He always believed that our best days were still ahead, but it\u2019s hard to imagine any of them without him.\"\nKennedy was the second-most-senior current member of the Senate, after Democratic President \"pro tempore\" Robert Byrd of West Virginia, and the third-longest-serving senator of all time, behind Byrd and Republican Senator Strom Thurmond of South Carolina. Kennedy was known as \"The Lion of the Senate,\" for his long tenure and influence in the Senate. Throughout his career, Kennedy and his staff wrote more then 300 bills that were enacted into law.\nBecause of Kennedy's death, the Democratic Party has lost their sixty-seat supermajority in the Senate. His successor will be chosen in a special election within 160 days. Prior to his death, Kennedy appealed to Democratic Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick and the Massachusetts legislature to change state law regarding Senate vacancies, so that a temporary senator could be appointed pending a special election and a vote in favor of a health-care bill would not potentially be lost. This law had been changed in 2004 to prevent Republican then-Governor Mitt Romney from appointing a replacement for Democratic Senator John Kerry, had he won the 2004 presidential election.\nReactions.\nPresident Barack Obama said of Kennedy in a press conference, \"Over the past several years, I've had the honor to call Teddy a colleague, a counselor, and a friend.\" He also noted that, \"The Kennedy name is synonymous with the Democratic Party. And at times, Ted was the target of partisan campaign attacks.\" However, he acknowledged his friendship that went across party lines saying, \"But in the United States Senate, I can think of no one who engendered greater respect or affection from members of both sides of the aisle.\"\nOne of Kennedy's former Senate colleagues and current Vice President Joe Biden gave an emotional retrospective of Kennedy's life at a U.S. Department of Energy press conference. He, like Obama, remarked upon his cross-aisle friendships in the Senate saying, \"Don't you find it remarkable that one of the most partisan, liberal men in the last century serving in the Senate had so many of his \u2014 so many of his foes embracing him, because they know he made them bigger, he made them more graceful by the way in which he conducted himself.\"\nBiden also remarked that without Kennedy's help during Biden's 1972 Senate campaign, \"I literally would not be standing here were it not for Teddy Kennedy \u2014 not figuratively, this is not hyperbole \u2014 literally.\" He also noted how Kennedy stood by his side when Biden lost his wife and daughter in a car accident.\nBiden closed by paraphrasing Shakespeare, \"I don't think we shall ever see his like again. I think the legacy he left is not just in the landmark legislation he passed, but in how he helped people look at themselves and look at one another.\"\nJohn Kerry, the now senior Senator from Massachusetts issued a statement saying, \"We have known for some time that this day was coming, but nothing makes it easier. We have lost a great light in our lives and our politics, and it will never be the same again.\" He added, \"For almost 25 years, I was privileged to serve as his colleague and share his friendship for which I will always be grateful.\"\nKennedy's Senate colleague, Majority Leader Harry Reid, said it was \"the thrill of my lifetime \" to work with a man he called the \"patriarch\" of the Senate.\nRepublican Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah \u2014 one of Kennedy's fiercest political opponents and closest friends in that chamber of the U.S. Congress \u2014 said the Democratic lawmaker will be remembered as \"someone who lived and breathed the United States Senate, and the work completed within its chamber.\"\nNancy Reagan, the wife of the late President Ronald Reagan, called Kennedy \"an ally and a dear friend\". Despite the political differences between her husband \u2014 a hero of conservative Republicans \u2014 and Kennedy \u2014 the stalwart liberal Democrat \u2014 Mrs. Reagan said she and Kennedy found common ground on the issue of stem-cell research. Mrs. Reagan has become a strong advocate of stem-cell research, which many believe will lead to treatment for illnesses such as Alzheimer's disease, which led to President Reagan's death in 2004.\nCalifornia Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, who is married to Kennedy's niece, Maria Shriver, called him \"the rock of our family\", and a champion of social justice.

All on board the helicopter, two passengers and the pilot of the helicopter, were also killed. \nConsidered a freak accident, the attention was not centered around the crash or those killed in it, but whether or not the volume on the iPod the 23-year-old pedestrian was allegedly listening to was too loud.\nIsaiah Otieno, a student at the College of the Rockies arrived in Canada two years ago and was the son of Dalmas Otieno, Kenya's Minister of State for Public Service. He was walking down the street to retrieve his mail when the Bell 206 helicopter crashed on top of him, crushed him, then dragged his body along the pavement, with the helicopter bursting into flames. The helicopter pilot was unable to maintain altitude when it crashed, killing Otieno and those inside the helicopter, instantly. The cause of the crash is not known and is still being investigated, but media outlets such as \"The Globe and Mail\" criticized the boy for wearing headphones and having the volume turned up too high, which allegedly caused him not to hear the aircraft falling from the sky.\n\"He was a brilliant student, very considerate, very aggressive at times. He had strong leadership qualities. Everybody here is just shattered,\" stated Dalmas.\nDespite the reports that Otieno was listening to his iPod, there has been no independent confirmation of those reports. \"Wikinews\" e-mailed the Royal Canadian Mounted Police to confirm or deny the iPod reports, but has not yet received a response. \nOther deaths have been blamed on media players like the iPod. In 2007, a boy was killed after a train struck him in Grimsby, Ontario. The boy, who had headphones on at the time, was unable to hear the sounds of the train's horn as it approached, which subsequently struck and killed him.\nThe helicopter was owned by Bighorn Helicopters and was rented to BC Hydro, the Province's power and water authority. The Pilot has been identified as Edward William Kyle Heeb, 57. The other two individuals killed were employees for BC Hydro and have been identified as Dirk Bentley Rozenboom, 45 and Robert William Lehmann, 37. They were checking power lines along 14th street in Cranbrook, when according to witnesses, the engine stopped and the helicopter crashed in the intersection of 14th and 10th.\nDespite the reports, a Canadian music consultant states that the accident involving the helicopter cannot be blamed on the use of Otieno's iPod.\n\"The average downtown street registers at around 60 decibels. A jet plane flying overhead is generally quoted at 120 to 130 decibels. If you are playing your music loud enough to cut out that level of noise, then you have it cranked to a degree that is damaging your hearing,\" said Geordon Hoag."}

Since its April 18 debut it has received criticism from the scientific community, which considers both pseudoscience, and film critics. \nThe case \"Lennon v Premise Media\" was filed by Yoko Ono, Julian Lennon, Sean Lennon, and EMI Blackwood Music, Inc. against Premise Media, C&amp;S Production, and Rocky Mountain Pictures in United States District Court for the Southern District of New York on April 23, 2008 alleging copyright infringement concerning John Lennon's song \"Imagine\". Premise is being represented by Anthony Falzone of the Fair Use Project.\nEMI filed its own separate lawsuit against Premise in a New York state court alleging that Premise's usage of the song is harming EMI\u2019s ability to license \u201cImagine,\u201d which has only been licensed in one film (The Killing Fields).\nIn court, Judge Richard Lowe, according to the Wall Street Journal, \"seemed skeptical\" about Falzone's arguments. Lowe asked Falzone why the film's producers did not read the lyrics to the song or flash the lyrics on the screen. Lawyers also pointed out that Premise Media licensed all other music in the film except for Lennon's song. At the end of the hearing Lowe \"decided to stay the original TRO pending his ruling, which means that \"Expelled\", currently playing in theaters around the country, cannot be reproduced or otherwise distributed.\"\nThe judge promised a quick decision since the film will debut in Canada on June 6 and DVD rights must be finalized by the end of May for October distribution.

Much of the instruments were also saved before the fire grew out of control.\nFirefighters had to take off large portions of the metal roof in order to battle the blaze which took almost five hours to bring under control and burned for almost 12. It is believed that welding on the roof may have caused the fire to start, but an investigation is ongoing. \nOfficials have yet to determine the total extent of the damage, but do say that nearly 17,000 square feet of the roof is burned.\nThe building, designed by Hans Scharoun, was built in 1963 to replace the previous concert hall which was destroyed in 1944 during World War II.

Human rights activists have criticized the decision to issue the 15-year-old the summons as an affront to freedom of speech, and representatives for the City of London Police force explained the actions of the police.\nIndividuals from the group Anonymous were protesting Scientology in the fourth protest in as many months, as part of the anti-Scientology movement Project Chanology. The Project Chanology movement began when the Church of Scientology attempted to get a leaked Scientology promotional video featuring Tom Cruise removed from websites YouTube and Gawker.com. \nMembers of Anonymous were motivated by the actions of the Church of Scientology, and bombarded Scientology websites and were successful in taking some of them down. Anonymous later changed tactics towards legal measures, and held international protests against Scientology on February 10, March 15, April 12, and most recently May 10. \nAt the May 10 protest, the 15-year-old boy was present and held up a placard which stated: \"Scientology is not a religion, it is a dangerous cult,\" with a mention at the bottom of the sign to the anti-Scientology website Xenu.net. He attended the protest held outside the Church of Scientology building on Queen Victoria Street, near St Paul's Cathedral in London. In a post made by the boy on the anti-Scientology website Enturbulation.org, he stated: \"Within five minutes of arriving I was told by a member of the police that I was not allowed to use that word, and that the final decision would be made by the inspector.\" The website describes itself as \"A Source for Information on Dianetics and the Scientology Organization\". Using the pseudonym \"EpicNoseGuy\" at the Enturbulation.org message board, the boy goes on to describe how he was \"strongly advised\" by police to remove the placard. \nCity of London Police cited section five of the Public Order Act 1986 to the boy, which deals with \"harassment, alarm or distress\". In response, the boy cited a 1984 judgment given by Mr. Justice Latey in the Family Division of the High Court of Justice of Her Majesty's Courts of Justice of England and Wales, in which Latey called Scientology a \"cult\" and said it was \"corrupt, sinister and dangerous\". In the actual 1984 judgment made by Judge Latey, he stated: \"Scientology is both immoral and socially obnoxious. [...] In my judgement it is corrupt, sinister and dangerous. [...] It is dangerous because it is out to capture people, especially children and impressionable young people, and indoctrinate and brainwash them so that they become the unquestioning captives and tools of the cult, withdrawn from ordinary thought, living and relationships with others.\" According to the boy's post at Enturbulation.org, the City of London Police told him he had 15 minutes to remove the sign in question. He was given a court summons by the police about a half-hour later, and his sign was removed and taken by the police as evidence.\nIn videos of the May 10 protest posted to YouTube, City of London Police can be seen telling protesters not to use the word \"cult\" in their signs. Protesters discussed the issue with police and stated that they had checked with lawyers and verified that criticizing religion was a valid form of protest. The police warned protesters that if they violated police instructions regarding usage of signs \"you will be prosecuted\". A female police officer read a form statement to the 15-year-old and stated: \"I've been asked, if you could remove it [the sign] by 11:30, if not then I'll have to come back and either summons you or arrest you.\" The boy read Mr. Justice Latey's 1984 judgment to the police, and then said: \"I'm not going to take this sign down.\" He told fellow protesters: \"If I don't take the word 'cult' down, here [holding up his sign], I will be either, I think, most likely arrested or [given] a summons. I am going to fight this and not take it down because I believe in freedom of speech, besides which I'm only fifteen.\"\nAfter the boy was given a summons one of the protesters asked a member of the City of London Police force: \"Are we allowed to say Justice Latey says Scientology is a cult?\", to which the police officer responded: \"I've already had this discussion with people. Direct quotes by individuals, I haven't got a problem with.\"\n\"This barmy prosecution makes a mockery of Britain's free speech traditions. After criminalising the use of the word 'cult', perhaps the next step is to ban the words 'war' and 'tax' from peaceful demonstrations?\" said Liberty director Shami Chakrabarti in a statement in \"The Guardian\". The boy has appealed for help in order to fight the potential charges and possible legal action from the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS).\nIan Haworth of the United Kingdom-based Cult Information Centre also commented on the actions of the City of London Police to \"The Guardian\", saying: \"This is an extraordinary situation. If it wasn't so serious it would be farcical. The police's job is to protect and serve. Who is being served and who is being protected in this situation? I find it very worrying.\"\nNews of the summons issued to the UK minor has received significant attention on the Internet, hitting the front pages of websites Slashdot, Digg, and Boing Boing on Wednesday. The story has also been discussed in hundreds of blog postings, including sites related to the tech-sector and others related to civil liberties.\nIn a statement given to publications including \"The Guardian\" and \"The Register\", a representative for the City of London Police explained the rationale for the summons: \"City of London police had received complaints about demonstrators using the words 'cult' and 'Scientology kills' during protests against the Church of Scientology on Saturday 10 May. Following advice from the Crown Prosecution Service some demonstrators were warned verbally and in writing that their signs breached section five of the Public Order Act 1986. One demonstrator, a juvenile, continued to display a placard despite police warnings and was reported for an offence under section five. A file on the case will be sent to the CPS.\" \n\"City of London Police upholds the right to demonstrate lawfully, but we have to balance that with the rights of all sections of the community not to be alarmed, distressed or harassed as a result of others' actions,\" said City of London Chief Superintendent Rob Bastable in a statement given to \"The Register\" and \"The Daily Telegraph\". Unlike the City of London Police, the Metropolitan Police Service (the territorial police force responsible for Greater London excluding the City of London) has not raised an issue with protesters using the word \"cult\", according to \"Londonist\".\nA spokesman for the CPS told \"The Guardian\" that they did not give City of London Police specific instruction about the boy's protest sign. The spokesman said that the CPS gave the City of London Police \"general advice\" about the laws governing protests and \"religiously aggravated crime\", but did not give advice about this specific case. \"... if we receive a file we will review it in the normal way according to the code for crown prosecutors,\" said the CPS spokesman.\nThe City of London Police has faced controversy in the past for its close association with the Church of Scientology. When the City of London Scientology building opened in 2006, City of London Chief Superintendent Kevin Hurley praised Scientology in an appearance as guest speaker at the building's opening ceremony. Ken Stewart, another of the City of London's chief superintendents, has also appeared in a video praising Scientology. According to \"The Guardian\" over 20 officers for the City of London Police have accepted gifts from the Church of Scientology including tickets to film premieres, lunches and concerts at police premises. Janet Kenyon-Laveau, spokeswoman for the Church of Scientology in the UK, told \"The Guardian\" that the relationship between the City of London Police and Scientology was mutually beneficial, and said that Scientologists conducted clean-up campaigns in urban areas affected by drug use problems. A City of London Police spokesman released a statement in November 2006 saying: \"We are conducting a review to ensure that all members of staff are aware of the force policy on accepting hospitality and to assess whether clarification or amendment of this policy is necessary.\"\nEach of the Project Chanology international protests against Scientology has had a theme: the February protest called attention to the birthday of Lisa McPherson, who died under controversial circumstances while under the care of Scientology, the March protest was arranged to take place two days after Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard's birthday, the April protest highlighted the Church of Scientology's disconnection policy, and the May protest highlighted the Scientology practice of \"Fair Game\" and took place one day after the anniversary of the publication of Hubbard's book \"Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health\". Another international protest is planned for June 14, and will highlight the Church of Scientology's elite \"Sea Organization\" or \"Sea Org\"."}

The attacks prompted an investigation by the Taiwanese information security industry into the source of these attacks.\nAn SQL injection is a common method employed by malicious users to attack and deface websites, arising from website mistakes in checking user input. Attackers take advantage of these weaknesses to inject information of their choosing into the website. For example, in June of 2007, Microsoft UK found its webpage changed to a picture of the Saudi Arabia flag, an attack which was carried out using an SQL injection.\nAccording to SecurityFocus, this most recent series of attacks stems from a vulnerability in versions 9.0.115.0 and 9.0.124.0 of Flash Player. It allows attackers to load any code they wish onto a computer running these versions of Flash.\nAs the vulnerability in Flash is newly discovered, Adobe has not yet released a newer version which fixes the problem. For the time being, computer security experts recommend that internet users with one of the unprotected versions of Flash disable the plug-in on Mozilla Firefox or Internet Explorer to prevent malicious users from gaining control over their computers.\nThe most recent version of the Flash Player, version 9.0.124.0, does not appear to be vulnerable to this exploit.

Scientists at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York who made the discovery, have determined it to be nearly 90 percent pure. They also say the only way for the substance to be present there is if there was an abundance of water present on the planet sometime in its past. The water would have been superheated and coming up through hydrothermal vents or even hot springs which scientists say would have been similar to ones already present at Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming.\nHydrothermal vents are fissures with superheated water and gases venting from the planet's surface. The vents are usually found around highly volcanic areas at the bottoms of seas and oceans. To this day, these vents or evidence of them have only been found on Earth. \n\"On Earth, the only way to have this kind of silica enrichment is by hot water reacting with rocks. Home Plate came from an explosive volcanic event with water or ice being involved. We saw where rocks were thrown into the air and landed to make small indentations in the soft, wet ash sediment around the vent,\" said Dr. Steven Ruff of Arizona State University (ASU) in Arizona, one of the authors of the announcement of the findings published in \"Science\".\nThe finding has lead to more questions about Mars and whether or not it once had life present on it, and if so, where and how much.\n\"On Earth, hydrothermal deposits teem with life and the associated silica deposits typically contain fossil remains of microbes. What we can say is that this was once a habitable environment where liquid water and the energy needed for life were present,\" said another author of the report, Dr. Jack Farmer also from ASU.\nRuff also states that much of the area Mars already searched seems to be covered with silica. \"It's not just the soil in a trench in one place. It's a broader story of outcrops that extend 50 meters [about 150 feet] away from Home Plate. It's not a small scale, modest phenomenon.\"\nSpirit is the first of two rovers which landed on Mars in January of 2004.

The seminars are run by a San Francisco, California-based training company called . The company evolved from \"est\", and has faced criticism regarding its techniques and its use of unpaid labor. The and company Los Angeles-based Growing Generations is named as a defendant in the New York lawsuit, and the Democratic is a defendant in the Washington, D.C. case.\nIn separate lawsuits filed in the in Manhattan, New York, and in the in Washington, D.C., former employees are suing their employers for and claiming religious discrimination after their employers allegedly mandated that they attend courses at Landmark Education.\nIn the US$3 million federal lawsuit filed in New York, Scott Glasgow is suing his former employer Growing Generations and its Stuart Miller. Growing Generations maintains sperm banks and also arranges surrogacy for gay couples who wish to have children. The company has offices in New York and Los Angeles, and has done business with celebrities including actor of \"\". \nGlasgow was marketing director of Growing Generations, and claims he was fired in June 2007 after refusing to continue attending Landmark Education seminars. Glasgow is also suing for sexual harassment, and claims Miller came on to him in September 2006. He made approximately $100,000 per year as the company's marketing director, and was the company's only employee based out of New York City. The company's main offices are in Los Angeles.\n\"I was shocked when I was fired. It took me months to right myself. I want them to stop imposing Landmark on the employees, and I want an apology,\" said Glasgow in a statement in \"\". Brent Pelton, one of Glasgow's attorneys, stated that: \"The Landmark philosophy is deeply ingrained in the culture of the company\". Glasgow said that the Landmark Education training courses were \"opposite\" to his Christian beliefs. According to Glasgow he was questioned by Miller in May 2007 after he walked out of a Landmark Education course, and was fired shortly thereafter. \"We stand by the allegations contained in the complaint and we look forward to proving them at trial,\" said Pelton in a statement to \"ABC News\".\nIan Wallace, an attorney who represents Growing Generations, claimed that Glasgow wasn't fired but walked away from his position. \"Growing Generations and Mr. Miller are very confident that these claims will be dismissed ultimately, and there's no factual basis for them whatsoever,\" said Wallace in a statement to \"The Village Voice\". Lawyers representing Growing Generations and Stuart Miller declined comment to \"\", and did not immediately return a message from \"ABC News\".\nIn Glasgow's complaint, entered into federal court record on April 18, he asserts that Landmark Education constitutes a \"religion\", and \"perceived their philosophy as a form of religion that contradicted his own personal beliefs\". He states that when he was promoted to Director of Marketing, he asked Miller if he could stop attending the Landmark sessions but was told that they were mandatory for all of the company's executives and that Landmark is \"very much the language of the company.\" Glasgow said his performance at the company was assessed based on how he was \"touching, moving and inspiring\" others, a phrase from the Landmark philosophy, as opposed to his business accomplishments at the company. The complaint claims that the actions of Miller and Growing Generations violated Federal, New York State and New York City civil rights laws.\nThe lawsuit filed in federal court in Washington, D.C. deals with a separate plaintiff and company, but the plaintiff in the suit also claims that religious discrimination took place for allegedly being mandated to attend Landmark Education courses. Kenneth Goldman is suing the United States Democratic political action committee Twenty-First Century Democrats (also 21st Century Democrats) and its former executive director Kelly Young. Goldman was formerly the communications director of 21st Century Democrats. \nAccording to Goldman's complaint, three employees of 21st Century Democrats were fired after refusing to attend the Landmark Forum course. The complaint asserts that Landmark Education has \"religious characteristics and theological implications\" which influenced the mission of 21st Century Democrats and the way the organization conducted business. Goldman's complaint states that in addition to himself, a training director and field director were also fired after they made it clear they would not attend the Landmark Forum. \nGoldman says executive director Young infused Landmark Education terms into staff meetings such as \"create possibilities\", \"create a new context\", and \"enroll in possibilities\". He also claims that Young \"urged\" staff members to participate in Landmark Education events outside of the workplace, drove employees to and from Landmark functions, and used funds from 21st Century Democrats to pay for employees to attend those functions. Goldman's complaint asserts that he was discriminated against in violation of the District of Columbia Human Rights Act. \nIn a statement in \"\", the executive director of 21st Century Democrats, Mark Lotwis, called the lawsuit \"frivolous\" and said: \"we're going to defend our organization's integrity\". Landmark Education spokeswoman Deborah Beroset said that the Landmark Forum \"is in no way religious in nature and any claim to the contrary is simply absurd,\" and stated: \"While we are not a party to this lawsuit and have no firsthand knowledge of it, we can only assume that we are being used as a legal and political football to further the plaintiff\"s own financial interests.\"\nThe New York lawsuit was filed April 14, and is still in early filing stages. A conference with the federal court judge in the case has been scheduled for June 17. The Washington, D.C. suit began in November 2007, and entered mediation this past March. As of April 15 the parties in the case were due back to court on July 11 to update the court on the mediation process. \nLandmark Education is descended from , also called \"est\", which was founded by Werner Erhard. est began in 1971, and Erhard's company repackaged the course as \"The Forum\" in 1985. Associates of Erhard bought the license to his \"technology\" and incorporated Landmark Education in California in 1991.\nThis is not the first time employees have sued claiming mandatory attendance at \"Forum\" workshops violated their civil rights. In a lawsuit filed in December 1988 in the , eight employees of DeKalb Farmers Market in , Georgia sued their employer claiming their religious freedom and civil rights were violated when they were allegedly coerced into attending \"Forum\" training sessions. \"Many of these training programs, particularly at large corporations, claim to be purely psychological, aimed at improving productivity and morale and loyalty. But in fact they are religious,\" said professor Carl Raschke in a statement to \"\".\nThe DeKalb Farmers Market employees were represented by lawyers for the American Civil Liberties Union. Consulting Technologies Inc., an affiliate of Transformational Technologies Inc., was named as a party in the lawsuit. Transformational Technologies was founded by Werner Erhard, and was not named as a party in the suit. The \"Forum\" course that the employees claimed they were mandated to attend was developed by Werner Erhard and Associates. Employees said that they were fired or pressured to quit after they objected to the Forum courses. \nThe workers claimed that the Forum course contradicted with their religious beliefs. The plaintiffs in the suit included adherents of varying religious backgrounds, including Christianity and Hinduism. \"The sessions put people into a hibernating state. They ask for total loyalty. It's like brainwashing,\" said Dong Shik Kim, one of the plaintiffs in the case. The plaintiffs said they lost their jobs after objecting to a \"new age quasi-religious cult\" which they said was developed by Werner Erhard.\nThe DeKalb Farmers Market denied the allegations, and an attorney for the company Edward D. Buckley III told \"The Wall Street Journal\" that employees were encouraged, not coerced, to attend the training sessions. According to \"The Wall Street Journal\", The Forum said it would not sanction workers being coerced to attend its training sessions. \nThe parties in the DeKalb Farmers Market religious discrimination case came to a settlement in May 1989, and the case was in June. The terms of the out-of-court settlement were not made public, but the employees' attorney Amy Totenberg told \"The Wall Street Journal\" that the case \"has made employers come to grips with the legitimate boundaries of employee training\".\nAccording to Title VII of the , employers must \"reasonably accommodate\" their employees' religious beliefs unless this creates \"undue hardship\". In September 1988, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission issued a policy-guidance notice which stated that courses should be handled under Title VII of the Act. According to the Commission, employers must provide \"reasonable accommodation\" if an employee challenges a training course, unless this causes \"undue hardship\" for the company.\nIn October 2006, Landmark Education took legal action against Google, YouTube, the and a website owner in Queensland, Australia in attempts to remove criticism of its products from the Internet. The company sought a subpoena under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act in an attempt to discover the identity of an anonymous critic who uploaded a 2004 French documentary of the Landmark Forum to the Internet. \" (Voyage to the Land of the New Gurus) was produced by \", a French news program. The Electronic Frontier Foundation represented the anonymous critic and the Internet Archive, and Landmark withdrew its subpoena in November 2006 in exchange for a promise from the anonymous critic not to repost the video.\nLandmark Education itself has come under scrutiny for its controversial labor practices. The company has been investigated by the in separate investigations originating out of California, Colorado, and Texas. Investigations focused on the heavy reliance of unpaid labor in the company's workforce, which Landmark Education calls \"assistants\" and deems volunteers. \nAn investigation by the U.S. Dept. Labor based out of Colorado found that activities performed by Landmark Education's \"assistants\" include: \"office, clerical, telephone solicitation and enrollment, as well as greeting customers, setting up chairs, handling microphones during the seminars and making coffee. Additionally, a number of volunteers actually teach the courses and provide testimonials during and after the courses.\" The Colorado investigation's 1996 report found that \"No records are kept of any hours worked by any employees.\" According to a 1998 article in \"\": \"In the end the Department of Labor dropped the issue, leaving Landmark trumpeting about its volunteers' choice in the matter.\" \"Metro Silicon Valley\" reported that Landmark Education at the time employed 451 paid staff, and also utilized the services of 7,500 volunteers.\nAfter an investigation into Landmark Education's labor practices by the U.S. Dept. Labor's offices out of California, the company was deemed to have violations. According to the Department of Labor's 2004 report on the investigation, back wages of $187,569.01 were found due to 45 employees. An investigation by the U.S. Dept. Labor in Texas which concluded in 2005 stated: \"Minimum wage violation found. Volunteers (Assistants) are not paid any wages for hours worked while performing the major duties of the firm. The assistants set up rooms, call registrants, collect fees, keep stats of classroom data/participants, file, they also are answering phones, training and leading seminars.\" \nThe Texas investigation also discovered an overtime violation. Landmark Education agreed to pay back wages for the overtime violation, but did not comply with the overtime violation found by the U.S. Dept. Labor for the \"assistants\". Landmark Education denied that the \"assistants\" are employees, though the Department of Labor report concluded: \"Interviews reveal that the employees are taking payments, registering clients, billing, training, recruiting, setting up locations, cleaning, and other duties that would have to be performed by staff if the assistants did not perform them.\"\nAccording to the 2004 investigative report by \"Pi\u00e8ces \u00e0 Conviction\" in the \"Voyage au pays des nouveaux gourous\" program, Landmark Education was investigated by the French government in 1995. In the \"Voyage au pays des nouveaux gourous\" program volunteers were filmed through a hidden camera and shown performing duties for Landmark Education in France including manning phones, recruitment and financial work for the company, and one volunteer was shown cleaning a toilet. \n\"\" reported that after \"Voyage au pays des nouveaux gourous\" aired in France, labor inspectors investigated Landmark Education's use of unpaid volunteers. According to \"Le Nouvel Observateur\", one month after the labor investigation took place the French branch of the company had disbanded. A former \"Introduction Leader\" to the Landmark Forum, Lars Bergwik, has recently posted a series of videos to YouTube critical of the company and its practices. Bergwik appeared on a 2004 program on Sweden's , \"Kalla Fakta\" (Cold Facts). According to Bergwik, after the \"Kalla Fakta\" program on Landmark Education aired, \"Landmark left Sweden\"."}

Such designations have previously been assigned to, and in some cases later removed from, civilian satellites.\nA small technology demonstration satellite, Yubileiny, was also launched. It was built to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the launch of Sputnik 1, and will be operated by NPO PM. It will broadcast audio and visual programmes on amateur radio frequencies, detailing the history of the space programmes of Russia and the Soviet Union, as well as signals imitating those of Sputnik 1.\nThe Rokot is a small carrier rocket derived from the UR-100 missile. Its upper stage, the Briz-KM, is a scaled-down version of the Briz-M upper stage used on Proton rockets. This is the first launch of a Briz upper stage of either type since the failure of a Briz-M during a March Proton launch, which left the AMC-14 satellite stranded in Medium Earth orbit.\nThis is the 25th orbital launch of 2008 in spaceflight, and the 13th launch of a Rokot. The next Rokot launch is scheduled for early-mid September, with the GOCE satellite for the European Space Agency."}

Some areas showed excessive levels of acid less than four miles off the northern California coastline in the United States.\n\"What we found ... was truly astonishing. This means ocean acidification may be seriously impacting marine life on the continental shelf right now. The models suggested they wouldn't be corrosive at the surface until sometime during the second half of this century,\" said Richard A. Feely, an oceanographer from the NOAA.\nThe natural processes of the seas and oceans constantly clean the Earth's air, absorbing 1/3 to 1/2 of the carbon dioxide generated by humans. As the oceans absorb more of the gas, the water becomes more acidic, reducing the amount of carbonate which shellfish such as clams and oysters use to form their shells, and increasing the levels of carbonic acid. Although levels are high, they are not yet high enough to threaten humans directly.\n\"Scientists have also seen a reduced ability of marine algae and free-floating plants and animals to produce protective carbonate shells,\" added Feely.\nFeely noted that, according to the study, the oceans and seas have absorbed more than 525 billion tons of carbon dioxide since the Industrial Revolution began."}

The legislation is called \"Bernie Banton law\", after the late campaigner for asbestos-related issues. The law will remove a restriction which prevented asbestos victims from making another claim after being diagnosed with a terminal illness. Banton contracted mesothelioma after working for the Netherlands-based company James Hardie, and died in 2007.\nPrior to the Banton law victims of asbestos exposure could seek compensation for asbestosis, a disease resulting from exposure which causes lung scarring, but were unable to seek compensation if they were later diagnosed with mesothelioma. \nMesothelioma is a cancer which develops in the sac surrounding the lungs and chest cavity, abdominal cavity, or the sac surrounding the heart. Patients with malignant mesothelioma generally do not have positive outcomes, and once diagnosed have six months to a year to live. Asbestos usage has been banned in Victoria, Australia since 2003.\nVictorian Premier John Brumby welcomed the legislation, saying: \"Victorian workers deserve fair compensation for illnesses and injuries they have received just by doing their job.\" Brumby acknowledged that Victoria had lagged behind other states in its asbestos compensation practices. \"Allowing an exception to the normal rule that court-awarded compensation is final will allow compensation for the true effects of asbestos exposure,\" explained Brumby.\nBernie Banton's widow, Karen Banton, stood alongside John Brumby as the legislation was announced, and spoke out in favor of the law. \"The uncertainty that these Victorian families have suffered up until this point, the dilemma of whether I claim and whether I wait ... it would be a terrible choice to have to make,\" she said. She said her late husband would have been honored by the legislation's passage, and was appreciative that his name was associated with the cause of justice in the country. \"I'm sure Bernie's looking down from heaven, feeling very honoured and humbled that his name continues to be associated with the fight to correct injustice,\" she said.\nThe Australian Manufacturing Workers Union and the Victorian Trades Hall Council supported the legislation's passage, as did Martin Kingham of the Asbestos Diseases Society of Victoria. Kingham said that in the past asbestos sufferers were wary about whether or not to make a claim: \"They've had to gamble on whether to make a claim now and to cut off any compensation for more serious fatal illness or to, basically, sit it out and wait and see what happens to them and potentially not getting compensated for their original asbestosis.\" \n\"There's a lot of asbestos around, this is a live issue for the community and we strongly welcome this initiative,\" said Australian Manufacturing Workers Union Victorian secretary Steve Dargavel. Victorian Trades Hall Council secretary Brian Boyd called the legislation \"a good and decent thing\" but said more action was needed to better protect asbestos victims' families. The additional claims are expected to help approximately 50 people each year. The legislation will be introduced in the State Parliament next year."}

The City of London Police had previously confiscated the boy's protest placard and gave him a court summons at the demonstration, which took place near St Paul's Cathedral at the Church of Scientology's London headquarters on Queen Victoria Street. The boy's poster read: \"Scientology is not a religion, it is a dangerous cult\". The human rights organization Liberty has come out strongly against the City of London Police for their actions at the protest, and said they are pursuing an inquiry into the police force for what they say is a troubling freedom of speech issue.\nIndividuals from the group Anonymous have held monthly international protests against the Church of Scientology since February, as part of the anti-Scientology movement Project Chanology. The Project Chanology movement began when the Church of Scientology attempted to get a leaked Scientology promotional video featuring Tom Cruise removed from websites YouTube and Gawker.com. \nMembers of Anonymous were motivated by the actions of the Church of Scientology, and bombarded Scientology websites and were successful in taking some of them down. Anonymous later changed tactics towards legal measures, and held international protests against Scientology on February 10, March 15, April 12, and most recently May 10. \nCity of London Police approached the 15-year-old boy at the May 10 protest and cited section five of the Public Order Act 1986, which deals with \"harassment, alarm or distress\". In response, the boy cited a 1984 judgment given by Mr. Justice Latey in the Family Division of the High Court of Justice of Her Majesty's Courts of Justice of England and Wales, in which Latey called Scientology a \"cult\" and said it was \"corrupt, sinister and dangerous\". In the actual 1984 judgment made by Judge Latey, he stated: \"Scientology is both immoral and socially obnoxious. [...] In my judgement it is corrupt, sinister and dangerous. [...] It is dangerous because it is out to capture people, especially children and impressionable young people, and indoctrinate and brainwash them so that they become the unquestioning captives and tools of the cult, withdrawn from ordinary thought, living and relationships with others.\" The boy told fellow protesters he was not going to take the sign down, saying: \"If I don't take the word 'cult' down, here [holding up his sign], I will be either, I think, most likely arrested or [given] a summons. I am going to fight this and not take it down because I believe in freedom of speech, besides which I'm only fifteen.\"\nWhen the boy refused to take his sign down, City of London Police removed it, cited him with a court summons and informed him that the matter would be referred to the Crown Prosecution Service. The boy was the only protester who did not comply with the police requests to remove signs which referred to Scientology as a \"cult\". According to \"The Guardian\", a CPS spokesman stated Friday that: \"In consultation with the City of London police, we were asked whether the sign, which read 'Scientology is not a religion it is a dangerous cult', was abusive or insulting. Our advice is that it is not abusive or insulting and there is no offensiveness, as opposed to criticism, neither in the idea expressed nor in the mode of expression. No action will be taken against the individual.\"\n\"The CPS review of the case includes advice on what action or behaviour at a demonstration might be considered to be threatening, abusive or insulting. The force's policing of future demonstrations will reflect this advice,\" said a spokeswoman for the City of London Police in a statement in \"The Guardian\". \nThe 15-year-old boy's mother called the CPS decision a \"victory for free speech\", saying: \"We're all incredibly proud of him. We advised him to take the placard down when we realised what was happening but he said 'No, it's my opinion and I have a right to express it'.\"\nThe incident has generated significant interest on the Internet, from civil rights groups and anti-cult groups, and in the press. Shami Chakrabarti, director of Liberty, and Ian Haworth of the United Kingdom-based Cult Information Centre were highly critical of the actions of the City of London Police. George Pitcher of \"The Daily Telegraph\" called the actions of the City of London Police \"a mockery of the law\". Other publications also criticized the actions of the police, compared the boy to past civil rights protesters, and analyzed how the characterization of \"cult\" applied to Scientology. \"The Guardian\" reported that human rights activists \"were outraged\" when reports of the actions of the City of London Police at the protest surfaced this week. Marina Hyde wrote in a comment piece in \"The Guardian\" that the City of London Police should spend a little less time \"reaching for the collar of free-speaking children\". An article in \"The Guardian\" about the boy's court summons hit the front page of the website Slashdot on Wednesday, and an article about the statement by CPS hit the site's front page on Friday. The anti-Scientology website Enturbulation.org devoted its front page to the incident on Saturday.\n\"BBC News\" reported that attorneys for Liberty represented the 15-year-old boy to the CPS. In media statements Friday, Liberty said it would continue its inquiry into the actions of the City of London Police. \"The police may have ended their inquiries into this tawdry incident but rest assured that Liberty's inquiry will continue. Democracy is all about clashing ideas and the police should protect peaceful protest, not stifle it,\" said James Welch, legal director at Liberty. \"Reason has prevailed in the case of the anti-Scientology protester\", wrote Welch in a comment piece in \"The Observer\". According to \"The Press Association\", Liberty's inquiry may result in actions taken against the City of London Police.\nThe City of London Police has faced controversy in the past for its close association with the Church of Scientology. When the City of London Scientology building opened in 2006, City of London Chief Superintendent Kevin Hurley praised Scientology in an appearance as guest speaker at the building's opening ceremony. Ken Stewart, another of the City of London's chief superintendents, has also appeared in a video praising Scientology. According to \"The Guardian\" over 20 officers for the City of London Police have accepted gifts from the Church of Scientology including tickets to film premieres, lunches and concerts at police premises. \nUnlike the City of London Police, the Metropolitan Police Service (the territorial police force responsible for Greater London excluding the City of London) has not raised an issue with protesters using placards with similar wording at protests against Scientology, according to \"The Guardian\" and \"Londonist\".\nEach of the Project Chanology international protests against Scientology has had a theme: the February protest called attention to the birthday of Lisa McPherson, who died under controversial circumstances while under the care of Scientology, the March protest was arranged to take place two days after Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard's birthday, the April protest highlighted the Church of Scientology's disconnection policy, and the May protest highlighted the Scientology practice of \"Fair Game\" and took place one day after the anniversary of the publication of Hubbard's book \"Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health\". Another international protest is planned for June 14, and will highlight the Church of Scientology's elite \"Sea Organization\" or \"Sea Org\"."}

Pestonji\".\nPestonji was born in Bangkok on May 22, 1908, to a Parsi-Indian (ethnic Persian) family. For his first short film, \"Tang\", in 1937, he received an award from Alfred Hitchcock at a film festival in Scotland. Pestonji directed his first feature film, \"Dear Dolly\", in 1951. He was known for his skills as a cinematographer, and he shot the first Thai feature film to be submitted to an overseas film festival. Pestonji also pushed for innovations in the Thai film industry, such as using 35mm film, and raising the level of cinematography as an artistic element of the films, said film historian Dome Sukwong, director of the National Film Archive.\nThe now-lost \"Santi-Weena\" was submitted to the Asia-Pacific Film Festival in 1954 in Tokyo. Pestonji served as cinematographer on it as well as \"Forever Yours\", in 1955. He then directed four features, \"Country Hotel\" in 1957, \"Dark Heaven\" in 1958, \"Black Silk\" in 1961, and \"Sugar Is Not Sweet\" in 1964. His films were never box-office successes, which led to Pestonji retiring from feature-film work to make television commercials, Sukwong said.\nPestonji died of a heart attack on August 17, 1970 at the Montien Hotel Bangkok, while giving a speech to government officials and film industry executives about the prevalence of Hollywood films in Thailand's cinemas.\nPestonji's legacy.\nContemporary directors who were influenced by Pestonji include Wisit Sasanatieng and Pen-ek Ratanaruang (\"Last Life in the Universe\"). Sasanatieng was among the filmmakers present at Thursday's event.\n\"\"Prae Dum\" [\"Black Silk\"] is the film that remains my single major influence,\" Sasanatieng was quoted as saying by the \"Bangkok Post\". Sasanatieng's colorful features, \"Tears of the Black Tiger\" and \"Citizen Dog\" bear many of the hallmarks of Pestonji's films. \"Khun Ratana was not simply a master storyteller ... he knew how to use color, art direction and camera angles to create subtle nuances and charge the movie with strong emotions.\"\nPestonji's sons, Santa and Edel, have continued in the film business. The Bangkok film production house their father started now houses a firm that hires out equipment and film crews to foreign films shooting on location in Thailand. Films that the company has been involved with include \"Heaven &amp; Earth\" and \"The Beach\". Pestonji's daughter, Ratanavadi Ratanabhand, was the lead actress in 1961's \"Black Silk\".\nNew facilities.\nThe Pestonji centennial celebration was the first major event held in the new facilities at the National Film Archive, which moved around 10 years ago to the Fine Arts Department compound in Nakhon Pathom Province, about 50 kilometers from Bangkok, where the archive had been previously located. The museum and cinema complex were built in the last year, and Thursday's event was the first major function held at the facility, said Chalida Uabumrungjit of the Thai Film Foundation, which has worked closely with the National Film Archive to preserve Pestonji's legacy. The foundation holds the rights to Pestonji's films and plans to issue a DVD set of his works later this year.\nThe centerpiece of the archive's museum is a wax figure of Pestonji, seated with his prized Mitchell camera in front of a recreation of the set from his 1957 musical comedy \"Country Hotel\". \nIn a manner similar to Grauman's Chinese Theatre in Hollywood, handprints, footprints and signatures of celebrities are being collected in the concrete outside the museum's cinema. That initiative started on Thursday with actor Prompong Nopparit, a spokesman for the Ministry of Culture, being the first to make his marks.\nOther stars making impressions included actor Suthep Wongkamheng, who starred in Pestonji's \"Dark Heaven\". A rain storm dampened the festivities, but didn't keep 1970s action star Sombat Metanee from making his mark in the slab, albeit under cover of umbrellas. Other figures adding their marks to the wet cement were pioneering animator Payut Ngaokrachang and Santa Pestonji, Ratana's eldest son."}

The children were found in a 1700-acre compound belonging to the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. It is now believed that the original phone call was actually a hoax.\nPolice were monitoring the compound ever since it was bought by the group one year ago. According to Texas law there must have been \"a danger to the physical health or safety of the child which was caused by an act or failure to act of the person entitled to possession and for the child to remain in the home is contrary to the welfare of the child\". \nIn addition to the above there must also be \"the urgent need for protection required the immediate removal of the child and reasonable efforts, consistent with the circumstances and providing for the safety of the child, were made to eliminate or prevent the child\u2019s removal\"\nFinally, for state custody to be allowed there must also have been \"reasonable efforts have been made to enable the child to return home\". A lower court was given 10 days to make a decision on whether the above requirements are met. Although originally the mothers were allowed to stay with the children, they are not required to be separate unless the parents are aged under eighteen or the children are very young. The FLDS said in an open letter to the Governor of Texas that a \"critical crisis\" was unfolding due to these recent incidents. \nThe Texas courts system released documents on its website regarding the recent decision. It said that: \"the only danger to the male children or the female children who had not reached puberty identified by the Department was the Department\u2019s assertion that the pervasive belief system of the FLDS community groomed the males to be perpetrators of sexual abuse later in life and taught the girls to submit to sexual abuse after reaching puberty.\"\nThe document also noted that: \"There was no evidence that the male children, or the female children who had not reached puberty, were victims of sexual or other physical abuse or in danger of being victims of sexual or other physical abuse.\" The website reported that: \"While there was evidence that twenty females had become pregnant between the ages of thirteen and seventeen, there was no evidence regarding the marital status of these girls when they became pregnant or the circumstances under which they became pregnant other than the general allegation that the girls were living in an FLDS community with a belief system that condoned underage marriage and sex.\"\nThe report claimed there were five possible cases of abuse, \"There was no evidence that any of the female children other than the five identified as having become pregnant between the ages of fifteen and seventeen were victims or potential victims of sexual or other physical abuse\".\nIn addition to Texas, the group has compounds in Hildale, Mancos and many other locations. The church has around 10,000 members in total, and was founded in the 1930s. The church split from the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints due to the fact that it abandoned polygamy.\nThe Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints is led by Warren Jeffs \u2013 jailed last year for the rape and forced marriage of a 14 year old girl \u2013 is a breakaway branch of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, which abandoned the practice of polygamy in 1890."}

Colonel Jerry O'Hara has stated that U.S. led forces \"sincerely regrets the injury of any innocent civilians and condemns those terrorists who place civilians recklessly in harm's way.\"\nColonel Mudhir Qaisi, the police chief in Baiji, says that all seven killed were Sunni farmers traveling through the Mizari region. Fulaiyh Shimmari, a relative of a victim, reports that many family and friends were gathered for the release of a family remember from U.S custody. The American account of the event and its location differs from Shimmari's, who states that when U.S. forces were sighted, many people, including himself, began to flee in cars and on foot. He noted that, during the engagement, three of the seven people in the car were killed, including one child, and four others were shot as they fled on foot.\nThe American version is that U.S. forces fired warning shots, and when some of the occupants of the premises exhibited hostile intent, the Americans engaged in the fatal fire, resulting in the deaths of five militants. The methods used for this attack were not specified."}

He hopes to begin rallying support for the presidential run-off election against current President Robert Mugabe.\nTsvangirai had originally planned to return on May 17, but this was postponed when his party learnt of an assassination plot against him. Allegations of treason were also levelled at him last month by Justice Minister Patrick Chinamasa. President Mugabe's party, Zanu-PF, called the alleged plot \"fantasy\", but security among the MDC is still high, Mr. Tsvangirai being whisked away from Harare airport earlier today in a three-car convoy.\nNevertheless Mr. Tsvangirai has told reporters that he feels \"quite safe\" and \"not at all afraid\". He is confident that his activities in the last 6 weeks have managed to \"ensure an African consensus about the crisis in Zimbabwe\" and said in a telephone interview in Harare that he is \"excited to be home and gearing for the election\" and \"if Mugabe thinks he has beaten people into submission, he will have a rude shock on the 27th\".\nHuman rights groups and MDC members have claimed that Zanu-PF have been intimidating and violently oppressing Zimbabweans in order to win the run-off, Tsvangirai accusing Zanu-PF of wanting \"to decimate MDC structures,\" and \"Bloomberg\" have reported that inflation in the country, estimated in March at 355,000%, is the highest in the world.\nThe MDC won the parliamentary elections and beat Mugabe's Zanu-PF in the first round presidentials but the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission is organising a run-off election due to the MDC only purportedly gaining 47.9% of the first round vote, with Zanu-PF taking 43.2%. The run-off election is set to be on July 27 and the Southern African Development Community, which Mr. Tsvangirai says can \"instill confidence in the people of Zimbabwe\", will be monitoring the polling."}

This comes as United Nations (UN) peacekeepers discovered three mass graves in the nation containing an estimated total of 100 bodies.\nReports say that the warrant issued by the International Criminal Court (ICC) included at least two counts of crimes against humanity and four counts of war crimes which he allegedly committed in the \"Central African Republic from 25 October 2002 to 15 March 2003.\" \nBemba, who fled the DRC in 2007, was arrested near Brussels on Saturday, May 24 late in the day. He had exiled himself after facing accusations of treason, which he denies. Bemba was DRC's vice president from July 2003 to 2006, and in 2007 was elected to the nation's senate. He was also in control of a militia called the Movement for the Liberation of Congo from about 2002 until 2006. As the leader, he refused orders for the group to renounce armed conflict after a new government was elected in 2006.\nIn addition to his political roles, Bemba is a businessman worth an estimated several hundred million US dollars. He has business ties in radio as well as television and aviation.\nThe warrant describes the specific charges that Bemba is facing in accordance with the Rome Statute of the ICC:\n\"Pre-Trial Chamber III found that there are reasonable grounds to believe that in the context of a protracted armed conflict in the Central African Republic from about 25 October 2002 to 15 March 2003, MLC forces led by Jean-Pierre Bemba Gombo carried out a widespread or systematic attack against a civilian population during which rape, torture, outrages upon personal dignity and pillaging were committed in, but not limited to, the localities of PK 12, Bossongoa and Mongoumba,\" stated the ICC in a statement on their website.\nThe ICC states that this is the first in a series of arrests expected in an ongoing investigation. \n\"The warrant of arrest for Jean-Pierre Bemba Gombo is the first warrant issued in the situation in the Central African Republic. Four situations are currently under investigation by the Prosecutor: Uganda, Democratic Republic of Congo, Sudan (Darfur) [and the] Central African Republic,\" added the statement.\nA UN mission spokesperson stated that the bodies discovered in the DRC have been there possibly since the 1990's or even the early 2000's, but an investigation is ongoing. Troops were patrolling an area in Maboya, a village in the Kivu province, when they found the bodies.\n\"Apparently they were graves dating back to the 1990's, but it's difficult to know accurately. The first one they excavated contained 100 bodies. The second was seven, and the third one they couldn't estimate,\" said Kemal Saiki, a mission spokesperson for the UN.\nMillions of people are believed to have been killed during the years of 1998-2002 when the nation was ravaged with war."}

Since 2005, according to the World Squash Federation (WSF), there has been a lot of work to get squash into the Olympic Games. A marked rise in players across the world has occurred, and approximately 13 new countries have been adopted into the WSF.\nHowever, baseball is also considered among the favourites, because it has been tried before and because it is a major sport in the United States and growing in the rest of the world.

Landing itself occurred at 23:38:36 GMT.\nDuring descent, the spacecraft's progress was monitored by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter and 2001 Mars Odyssey spacecraft, already in Areocentric orbit. Mars Odyssey was in contact with Phoenix throughout the descent, including during the phase of the descent where maximum temperatures were reached, when controllers had predicted that data would be lost. The HiRISE camera on Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter was able to photograph \"Phoenix\" under its parachute during descent.\nPhoenix's goal is to gather environmental information about Mars to search for possible locations for the best signs of microbial life in the soil. It will also research the history of water on Mars. The mission is scheduled to last for at least 92 Earth days, or 90 Martian days.\nThe spacecraft landed in an area near the North Pole of Mars, unofficially named the Green Valley. It is an area about 250 kilometres wide, located in the Vastitas Borealis plains.\nPhoenix is carrying a number of instruments to investigate Mars. Some of these were taken from the cancelled 2001 Mars Surveyor lander, and some others were derived from instruments flown on the Mars Polar Lander (MPL) spacecraft. MPL was launched in January 1999, but failed during its descent to the Martian surface. Landing on Mars is considered to be one of the most difficult challenges in space exploration, and one scientist working on today's landing said that \"this is not a trip to Grandma's for the weekend\". More than half of previous missions to Mars have failed, leading to jokes that exploration of the planet is cursed.\nThis is the 38th spacecraft to be launched to Mars, and the 19th to arrive successfully, bringing the success rate to exactly 50 percent. It is also the 12th spacecraft to attempt a landing on Mars, and the 7th to successfully accomplish this.\nUpon confirmation of landing, a flight controller was heard to exclaim \"The Phoenix has landed, welcome to Vastitas Borealis!\", whilst others cheered, and congratulated each other on the successful landing."}

The complaints related to an exhibition of works by photographer Bill Henson, which included several photographs of naked pubescent children. Twenty-one of the forty photographs in the exhibition were seized during the raid, and police have announced that charges will be laid under the NSW Commonwealth and Crimes Act for \"publishing an indecent article\". Digital versions have also been removed from the Gallery's website.\nPoliticians on both sides of the fence spoke out against the exhibition. Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, speaking to the Nine Network, said he found the photos to be \"absolutely revolting [...] Whatever the artistic view of the merits of that sort of stuff - frankly I don't think there are any - just allow kids to be kids.\" His Opposition counterpart, Brendan Nelson, believes that the exhibition \"violates the things for which we stand as Australians and indeed as parents\".\nArt experts have supported Henson and defended his work, denying claims of child pornography and exploitation. According to Betty Churcher, a former director of the National Gallery of Australia, \"[t]here is absolutely no suggestion of pornography in these photographs\". Sydney art dealer Denis Savill hung one of Henson's works, featuring two nudes, in his gallery window beside an Arthur Boyd nude, to \"give them something to grizzle about\".\nAccording to Tony Oxley, husband of gallery owner Roslyn, the gallery's answering machine has recorded several threats to burn the building down. The police action also calls into question the fate of similar works by Henson in other galleries in Australia and around the world."}

But the school district is investigating Portillo's actions, says St. Lucie County School District spokeswoman Janice Karst, and it could be up to two weeks before a conclusion is reached.\nAfter being contacted by Barton, the school's resource officer interviewed Portillo about the incident. According to police spokeswoman Michelle Steele, the teacher said Alex had been sent to the office earlier that day, and when he came back to class, Portillo asked the students if they were ready for him to return. She allegedly had told her class that the vote was part of a lesson on tallying.\nPortillo, who has taught in St. Lucie County for 12 years, has been reassigned out of the classroom at the district offices for the time being. Alex's mother believes that Portillo has \"no business being near children at all\" and should be fired, calling her reassignment \"just a slap in the face\".\nThe school board has advised Portillo not to speak with the press."}

The study also says that many of these incidents remain unreported, and those involved often go unpunished.\nThe study was based on field data from Sudan, Ivory Coast and Haiti, where they held focus groups followed by in-depth interviews. In 20 of the 38 focus groups, United Nations representatives were the main perpetrators of sexual abuse, possibly due to the larger number of peacekeepers than aid workers, but 23 organisations were identified as being involved across the three countries. \nWhile 14 and 15 year olds were the most common victims, the study found cases of abuse in children as young as 6. Most offenders were men, and most of the victims were girls. One 14-year-old boy who works in a peacekeeping camp on the Ivory Coast told the study that \"[o]ften it will be between eight and 10 men who will share two or three girls\".\nAn \"overwhelming\" majority of those interviewed said they would never report a case of abuse, and did not know of anyone who had reported a case, despite more than half knowing of incidents of sexual abuse, and many knowing of 10 or more. The study reported that unless this silence was dealt with, any attempts to eliminate the abuse would be \"fundamentally flawed\".\nIn response to the study, United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon said that the organisation's policy on such abuse was \"zero tolerance.\" The U.N. \"will very carefully investigate and whenever there is necessary matters we will take necessary measures from this\". Both Save the Children and the U.N. have pointed out that, while it does not reduce the seriousness of the offences, the offenders represent a small proportion of all peacekeepers and aid workers in foreign countries. As the U.N. does not have any prosecutory powers of its own, peacekeepers found to be involved in child sexual abuse are either fired or sent back to their home countries to face prosecution."}

The defendant, Ohio-based company Owens Illinois, Inc., had sought a trial in a Spanish court, an opinion which was shared by the Superior Court that had heard the case earlier. The three-judge panel appellate court overturned the decision of the Superior Court in a 3-0 ruling.\nThe Spanish citizens worked aboard U.S. ships between 1950 and 1998, and claim that they were exposed to asbestos dust and fibers from piping insulation produced by Owens-Illinois. The piping insulation was originally manufactured in Sayreville, Middlesex County, and Berlin, Camden County, New Jersey. The workers say they suffer from diseases related to asbestos such as asbestosis. Owens-Illinois has headquarters in Toledo, Ohio and is a Delaware corporation.\nThe New Jersey appellate panel ruled that the Superior Court judge did not consider where the plaintiffs wanted their case heard, and also held that the U.S. ships are considered U.S. territory and thus the workers' claimed health issues did not begin on Spanish land. Attorneys for Owens-Illinois argued that U.S. ships, when docked, are subject to the law of Spain, and so the case should be heard in Spanish courts.\nThe court's opinion, written by Judge Anthony Parrillo, explained the ruling: \"In sum, we conclude that defendant has failed to carry its burden to demonstrate that Spain is an available adequate forum to adjudicate the parties' dispute and therefore the motion to dismiss on forum non conveniens grounds should have been denied without consideration of public- and private-interest factors.\" The decision reversed the ruling of the Superior Court and remanded the suit back to that court for trial.\n\"I find it difficult to understand how an appellate division court can countenance keeping the cases in New Jersey when there is absolutely no relation to New Jersey. There is barely any relationship to the United States of America. They've made their decision,\" said counsel for Owens-Illinois, John Garde, in a statement in \"The Star-Ledger\". No decision has yet been made on whether the company will appeal the ruling.\nMitchell S. Cohen, attorney for the Spanish workers, said that the Superior Court judge should have considered that the New Jersey court was the only location where the lawsuit could have been tried before dismissing the case. \"Spanish law will not allow, under the facts of these cases, to file a claim in Spain,\" said Cohen to the Associated Press. Cohen said that Spanish law states that a case cannot be filed in Spain because the alleged injuries occurred on U.S. territory.\nThis is not the only asbestos-related lawsuit in which Owens-Illinois is cited as a defendant. The company is also a defendant (among other defendants) in asbestos cases filed in Ohio and other states. In an April 30 press release the company reported that asbestos-related payments had decreased slightly, stating: \"Asbestos-related cash payments during the first quarter of 2008 were\n$40.2 million, down slightly from $41.0 million during the first quarter of\n2007.\" According to the press release, the company had 14,000 pending asbestos-related lawsuits as of March 31, 2008. In its balance sheet for the first quarter of 2008, the company reported US$835 million in asbestos-related liabilities.\nIn a May 2 earnings call with financial analysts, Owens-Illinois Chief Financial Officer Edward C. White addressed asbestos-related expenses. \"Only a small portion of our first quarter asbestos payments related to the company's proactive legal strategy to reduce risk and accelerate asbestos resolution on favorable terms. Nevertheless, this strategy continues and additional expected spending is reflected both on the current liability portion of our balance sheet as well as in our full-year cash flow projection,\" said White. \"We exited the business 50 years ago and have been dealing with the legal issues for almost 30 years. For OI, this remains a limited declining liability, which we will continue to manage in a conscientious and responsible manner.\"\nAsbestosis is a disease resulting from asbestos exposure which causes lung scarring and can lead to lung cancer. Exposure to asbestos can also lead to a more serious condition known as mesothelioma. Mesothelioma is a cancer which develops in the sac surrounding the lungs and chest cavity, abdominal cavity, or the sac surrounding the heart.

Dan Jessop, one of the parents, commented on the development. \"It's one step closer to my family being together.\"\n401 allegedly abused children were taken into state custody last month after officials received a call from a distressed 16-year-old girl. The children were found in a 1700-acre compound belonging to the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. It is now believed that the original phone call was actually a hoax.\nThe agreement follows an appeals court-ruling that Texas Child Protective Services (CPS) should not have taken the children from the FLDS.\nMeanwhile, CPS filed court papers today, saying that the families may choose to flee Texas if they are reunited per the appeals courts ruling. If they did that, they would suddenly be outside the court's jurisdiction, putting them at risk of abuse.\nLawyers for the mothers of the children, filed a counter-motion, stating that the children face \"continuing, irreparable harm every day that they are separated from their parents.\"\nPolice were monitoring the compound ever since it was bought by the group one year ago. According to Texas law there must have been \"a danger to the physical health or safety of the child which was caused by an act or failure to act of the person entitled to possession and for the child to remain in the home is contrary to the welfare of the child\". \nIn addition to the above there must also be \"the urgent need for protection required the immediate removal of the child and reasonable efforts, consistent with the circumstances and providing for the safety of the child, were made to eliminate or prevent the child\u2019s removal\"\nFinally, for state custody to be allowed there must also have been \"reasonable efforts have been made to enable the child to return home\". A lower court was given 10 days to make a decision on whether the above requirements are met. Although originally the mothers were allowed to stay with the children, they are not required to be separate unless the parents are aged under eighteen or the children are very young. The FLDS said in an open letter the Governor of Texas that a \"critical crisis\" was unfolding due to these recent incidents. \nIn addition to Texas, the group has compounds in Hildale and many other locations. The church has around 10,000 members in total, and was founded in the 1930s. The church split from the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints due to the fact that it abandoned polygamy.\nThe Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints is led by Warren Jeffs \u2013 jailed last year for the rape and forced marriage of a 14 year old girl \u2013 is a breakaway branch of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, which abandoned the practice of polygamy in 1890."}

Tchappat was a participant in the edition \"Big Brother Australia 2008\", and was voted off the show on May 25.\nTchappat, 33, a former police officer and presently a firefighter, left the controversial group at age 19. He says he attempted to leave at age 17 but was brought back by members of the group and \"interrogated\" by group leadership for months. Up until he left he had never eaten in a restaurant, listened to the radio or been to the movie theater. According to \"Macquarie National News\", Tchappat's former community numbers number approximately 15,000 in Australia. Raven-Taylor-Hales Brethren is a sect of Protestant Christianity and a breakaway group from Exclusive Brethren.\nDue to his departure from the group, Tchappat had to break off contact with family members still inside the organization, though at times he speaks with his parents. Members do not vote in elections because they feel it contradicts their belief that God should determine who is in power, but they provide finances to the Liberal Party of Australia. Tchappat's cousin Andrew left the group a few months after he did.\nAfter getting to know his fellow \"Big Brother Australia\" housemates for three weeks, Tchappat recounted some of his experiences in his former religious group. \"Look, I don't like to say it's a cult, but it basically is. My whole life was controlled. I didn't have a say in it myself,\" he said on one episode. He grew up in the Raven-Taylor-Hales Brethren community in Gosford, New South Wales, and explained: \"It's based on Christian values but it's very strict. So I had no TV, no radio, no computer, never been to a movie or a restaurant or kissed a girl - you name it, I didn't do it.\"\nIn an interview Tuesday with former \"Big Brother Australia\" runner-up Tim Brunero on \"Macquarie National News\", Tchappat said he is planning on releasing a book about his experiences growing up in the controversial religious group. \"I've spent the last two years writing it. It just happened that I got into Big Brother in the tail-end of it. Obviously there's a few more chapters to add, but I'm really pumped, it's an interesting story,\" he said. He plans to title the book \"Losing my Religion\". \nHe was also interviewed by \"ninemsn\" on Tuesday, and said he does not regret discussing his experiences in Raven-Taylor-Hales Brethren on Australian national television. \"I'm an example of how you can go out and be successful. I say to people that if you are thinking about leaving, and you're serious, take a punt and give it a go. You can always go back if you don't like it.\" Former members of the group were inspired by Tchappat's comments and empathized with his experiences in posts to \"Big Brother\" Internet message boards.\nPrime Minister of Australia Kevin Rudd criticized the Raven-Taylor-Hales Brethren group in August 2007. At the time he was leader of the Australian Labor Party, and requested that then-Prime Minister John Howard reveal what took place in a private meeting with senior members of the religious group. \"I believe this is an extremist cult and sect. I also believe that it breaks up families,\" said Rudd to reporters in Adelaide according to \"The Sydney Morning Herald\". He noted that the organization was being investigated by the Australian Federal Police for prior election activities, and wanted to know how much funding had been given by the group to the Liberal Party. \nDuring his election campaign Rudd called on Australian federal agencies including the anti-money laundering agency Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC), the Australian Federal Police, the Australian Taxation Office, and the Australian Electoral Commission to investigate the activities of Raven-Taylor-Hales Brethren. In spite of Rudd's criticism of Raven-Taylor-Hales Brethren, the religious group was guaranteed AUD10 million in taxpayer funding for its school facilities in January 2008. Rudd had promised during his election campaign to maintain education funding levels for non-government schools if he became Prime Minister.\nAustralia media reported on May 18 that Rudd rejected a request from former members of Raven-Taylor-Hales Brethren to investigate the group. 34 ex-members of the religious group had sent a letter to the Prime Minister's office asking him to investigate how they were treated in the organization. A spokesman for Rudd said that the ex-members should instead take their request to the police, and that a government investigation would raise religious freedom issues. Rudd's chief of staff David Epstein said that the Prime Minister \"does not resile from the views he expressed last year\" and \"remains concerned about the reported imposition of doctrines that weaken family bonds\". \nAustralian Greens spokeswoman Christine Milne told Australia's \"ABC News\" said that the well-being of children still in the group should be of primary concern. \"The issue here is not about religious freedom, it is about what this cult is doing to destroy families and effectively to undermine the law,\" said Milne. \nEx-member Peter Flinn, who wrote the letter sent to Rudd which was signed by 33 other former members, was disappointed by the Prime Minister's response. \"We just want to highlight other equally fundamental human rights, such as access to family who remain Brethren members, a right callously denied for decades,\" he said in a statement in \"The Sydney Morning Herald\". Senator Bob Brown of the Australian Greens party has proposed a government inquiry into the group's public funding, tax concessions and possible practices that harm children."}

Texas officials removed over 400 children from the Eldorado, Texas YFZ Ranch in early April on suspicion of widespread child abuse.\nThe photos were entered into evidence as part of the case in Tom Green County District Court. Officials claim there is a \"pervasive pattern\" of underage girls forced into marriage with older men. The photos show Warren Jeffs kissing and hugging young girls, and attorneys for Texas Child Protective Services claim that one of the girls shown in the photos is a 12-year old \"bride\". The photos are dated from July 2006 and January 2005.\nThe State of Texas is seeking custody of a baby boy born to Louisa Bradshaw and her \"husband\" Dan Jessop. According to the \"Deseret News\", Jessop was asked if he thought the photos of Jeffs and the girls was evidence of sexual abuse, to which he responded, \"I do not consider a girl kissing a man sex abuse.\" Child Protective Services lawyers told the court that the photos show Jeffs kissing the girls similar to \"how a husband kisses a wife\". \n\"Deseret News\" reported that Protective Services lawyers did not say how the images of Jeffs were obtained, but said that the photos illustrate a culture of abuse at the compound. According to CNN, information revealed in court shows that one of the girls in the photos is an aunt to the children involved in the Texas custody hearing and lived on the YFZ Ranch. CNN reports that the girl's birth date was given as July 1994 and she is 13 years old. She was taken into state custody by Texas officials along with other children in April.\nABC News reported that an alleged child bride shown in the photographs was set to give testimony in court, but state attorneys and FLDS representatives came to a resolution and agreed that Protective Services would retain custody of Louisa Bradshaw's baby. The baby was born in Texas state custody. Bradshaw was initially taken into custody as well because authorities thought she was under age, but it has since been revealed that she is over the age of 18. According to \"ABC News\" Bradshaw will remain with her baby in a shelter. Protective Services said that Bradshaw and Jessop lived in the same building as the 12-year old girl shown in the photographs with Jeffs. \nJeffs is seen in one set of photos from January 26, 2005 labeled \"First anniversary\" with a girl called \"Loretta\". In another set dated July 27, 2005, Jeffs is shown with a girl referred to as \"Merrianne\". Child Protective Services officials said that they have evidence that \"Merrianne\" was 12 years old when she was married to Jeffs at the YFZ compound. \"The Vancouver Sun\" reported that, per a family member, \"Loretta\" was no older than 12 when she was married. Portions from the set of photos were displayed at media sites including \"Radar Online\", CNN, FOX News, \"National Nine News\" and ABC News, and the website The Smoking Gun made three of the court exhibits available for viewing.\nIn a statement made Tuesday to CNN, Salt Lake City, Utah attorney and spokesman for FLDS families Rod Parker said the photos were an effort by Child Protective Services to \"get publicity\" and \"paint everybody with the same brush\". \"What I'm saying is, that isn't fair, and each parent of each family is entitled to stand on its own. And these photos have no ties to this particular family in a way that's relevant to these proceedings,\" said Parker.\n\"I'm sure law enforcement in several states will take a look to see what more can be done,\" said Utah Attorney General's Office Paul Murphy in a statement to ABC News. Murphy said that investigators may look further into the photographs to determine if evidence shows the girls were abused, and if so where, before charges could be brought. \"Everyone who saw those photos did a complete gasp. I think they're shocking,\" he said.\nIn a ruling made last week in a case involving 38 FLDS mothers and 124 children, the Texas 3rd District Court of Appeals said that the state did not have the right to remove those children from the compound. The appeals court said that Child Protective Services was unable to prove that the children in the compound were at risk of immediate physical harm. Texas law states that \"a danger to the physical health or safety of the child which was caused by an act or failure to act of the person entitled to possession and for the child to remain in the home is contrary to the welfare of the child\" must be shown in order to remove that child from the home. \nTexas Department of Family and Protective Services filed court papers Wednesday asserting that FLDS families may flee the state if they are reunited with their children after the Texas appeals court ruling. Protective Services officials are worried that if the families leave the court's jurisdiction, children could be at risk of abuse. In response, attorneys for mothers of the children in custody filed a counter-motion. The mothers claim that the children are under \"continuing, irreparable harm every day that they are separated from their parents\".\nWarren Jeffs was convicted in September 2007 of two counts of being an accomplice to rape related to a 2001 wedding he arranged between a 14-year old girl and her 19-year old cousin. He was sentenced to two consecutive five-year prison sentences in Utah, and faces an impending trial in Arizona on eight charges including sexual conduct with a minor, incest and conspiracy.\nThe FLDS group has approximately 10,000 members total, and was founded in the 1930s. It split from the The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) after the LDS Church abandoned the practice of polygamy in 1890."}

The performance was the first since the bands last visit on their \"As the World Burns Tour\" in 2006, and featured the original line-up of John Doe, Exene Cervenka, Billy Zoom, and D.J. Bonebrake.\nHaving not released an album of new work since 1993's hey Zeus!, the tour is an opportunity for one of punk rock's seminal bands to connect with their fans. The band played a strong set of material from their first four albums, all recorded during the years of 1980 - 1983.\nNo material from their last two studio albums was played, with some citing the strong preferences of guitarist Billy Zoom for the earlier work. X came on stage around 10:30 pm and played until close to midnight. Their full-throttle set started with \"Your Phone's Off the Hook, But You\u2019re Not,\" and didn\u2019t slow down after that, although slowing down might be hard seeing as the set was classic punk \u2013 high energy songs full of angst and anger. This was moderated though by Doe\u2019s on-going comments to the audience and Zoom's mugging. Exene, dressed in an oversize black dress seemed subdued and her vocals seemed quieter than usual \u2013 though her off-key harmonizing with Does\u2019 vocals was true to the song's original recordings. During the second encore they were joined by Rachel Nagy who provided additional vocals. That encore was delayed by Zoom, who was in the audience seemingly determined to meet every woman in the audience.\nWhile X has not produced an album of new material in 21 years, the band did visit recently as their alter-ego, The Knitters. Each of the members of the band has kept busy. Doe has released several solo albums and tours regularly and acts on television; Cervenka fronts the band, the Original Sinners, as well as spoken word performances; Zoom works as an album producer for other bands, and designs his own line of amps and guitars; while Bonebrake works with the Bonebrake Syncopators and Orchestra Superstring.\nThe opening act for X was the Detroit Cobras. The Cobras, fronted by singer Nagy and guitarist Mary Ramirez, provided an energetic opening for the headliners. The word for the night was fun as the members of X spent a good deal of time watching the opening act from the sides of the stage, with Zoom flirting with guitarist Ramirez and coming out on stage to wrestle with her. The Cobras returned the favor by dancing on stage during the last third of X's set.\nOn this tour, X has donated sets of tickets to the non-profit Sweet Relief Musicians Fund to provide assistance to all types of career musicians who are struggling to make ends meet while facing illness, disability, or age-related problems.

This requires changes to current theories of the evolution of vertebrate sexual reproduction. \nThe placoderm, a class of prehistoric fish known as the \"dinosaur of the seas\", dates back to the Devonian period, making the fossil the earliest known case of a vertebrate that gave birth to live young. It is also the only fossilised umbilical cord ever to be found.\nDr. John Long, Museum Victoria's head of sciences and the leader of the team examining the fossils, says the find \"changes our understanding of the evolution of vertebrates\".\nHe and Dr. Kate Trinajstic from the University of Western Australia were writing a paper on the fossil that was found during an Australian Research Council-funded expedition to the Gogo Formation, near the town of Fitzroy Crossing in Western Australia. They decided to give the fossil one last inspection, at which point they discovered the embryo. According to the research team, this discovery pushes the known development of viviparity (animals giving birth to live young) back 200 million years, and also marks the earliest known development of internal fertilisation, a feature now found in sharks and rays.\nDr. Long gave the species the Latin name \"Materpiscis attenboroughi\". \"Materpiscis\" derives from the Latin words meaning \"mother fish\", and \"attenboroughi\" was chosen in honour of Sir David Attenborough, who first drew attention to the Gogo region's possible fossils in a 1970s TV documentary.\nThe team's findings were published in the science journal \"Nature\", and the fossil specimen will be on display at the Melbourne Museum."}

Przemyk was beaten at a central Warsaw police station after being stopped while celebrating his high school leaving exams. Przemyk's case became a symbol of resistance to communism in Poland and his funeral turned into a massive demonstration against communist authorities.\nThe verdict pleased Przemyk's family and friends, who had seen the case intentionally covered up by the communist regime and then retried several times due to stonewalling by the suspects. Famously, former Interior Minister Czes\u0142aw Kiszczak was recorded as ordering prosecutors in the original investigation to only focus on the paramedics who finally delivered Przemyk to the hospital, and to ignore any leads related to the policemen. Though happy with the verdict, the victim's father, Leopold Przemyk, believes justice has not yet been served.\n\"Only the sword has been punished, and not the hand that held it,\" he said after the court announced its decision.\nPresiding judge Monika Niezabitowska-Nowakowska said that the verdict was made possible by new evidence that had not been known to the courts that had acquitted Ko\u015bciuk in the past. However, she said the beating could not be treated as a communist crime, since the policemen could not have known about Przemyk's dissident views, and that the beating they gave him was not politically motivated."}

After a 15-year-old boy refused to remove a sign calling Scientology a \"cult\" at a May 10 protest in London, City of London Police confiscated his sign and issued him a court summons. On May 23 the Crown Prosecution Service stated that there would be no prosecution of the boy. Liberty is investigating the actions of the City of London Police, and told \"The Guardian\" Wednesday that they may decide to lodge a complaint with the Independent Police Complaints Commission. The City Council of Edinburgh released a statement earlier this week saying they had no objections to the word \"cult\" being used on signs at anti-Scientology protests.\nIndividuals from the group Anonymous have held monthly international protests against the Church of Scientology since February, as part of the anti-Scientology movement Project Chanology. The Project Chanology movement began when the Church of Scientology attempted to get a leaked Scientology promotional video featuring Tom Cruise removed from websites YouTube and Gawker.com. \nMembers of Anonymous were motivated by the actions of the Church of Scientology, and bombarded Scientology websites and were successful in taking some of them down. Anonymous later changed tactics towards legal measures, and held international protests against Scientology on February 10, March 15, April 12, and most recently May 10. Localized protests have also been held in various cities in between the international protests.\nThe May 10 London protest took place near St Paul's Cathedral at the Church of Scientology's headquarters on Queen Victoria Street. The 15-year-old boy's poster read: \"Scientology is not a religion, it is a dangerous cult\". City of London Police approached the boy at the May 10 protest and cited section five of the Public Order Act 1986, which deals with \"harassment, alarm or distress\". In response, the boy cited a 1984 judgment given by Mr. Justice Latey in the Family Division of the High Court of Justice of Her Majesty's Courts of Justice of England and Wales, in which Latey called Scientology a \"cult\" and said it was \"corrupt, sinister and dangerous\". \nIn the actual 1984 judgment made by Judge Latey, he stated: \"Scientology is both immoral and socially obnoxious. [...] In my judgement it is corrupt, sinister and dangerous. [...] It is dangerous because it is out to capture people, especially children and impressionable young people, and indoctrinate and brainwash them so that they become the unquestioning captives and tools of the cult, withdrawn from ordinary thought, living and relationships with others.\" The boy told fellow protesters he was not going to take the sign down, saying: \"If I don't take the word 'cult' down, here [holding up his sign], I will be either, I think, most likely arrested or [given] a summons. I am going to fight this and not take it down because I believe in freedom of speech, besides which I'm only fifteen.\"\nWhen the boy refused to take his sign down, City of London Police removed it, cited him with a court summons and informed him that the matter would be referred to the Crown Prosecution Service. The boy was the only protester who did not comply with the police requests to remove signs which referred to Scientology as a \"cult\". According to \"The Guardian\", a CPS spokesman stated that: \"In consultation with the City of London police, we were asked whether the sign, which read 'Scientology is not a religion it is a dangerous cult', was abusive or insulting. Our advice is that it is not abusive or insulting and there is no offensiveness, as opposed to criticism, neither in the idea expressed nor in the mode of expression. No action will be taken against the individual.\"\n\"The CPS review of the case includes advice on what action or behaviour at a demonstration might be considered to be threatening, abusive or insulting. The force's policing of future demonstrations will reflect this advice,\" said a spokeswoman for the City of London Police in a statement in \"The Guardian\". \nShami Chakrabarti, director of Liberty, voiced concerns about the actions of the City of London Police, as did James Welch, legal director of Liberty. Liberty represented the 15-year-old boy to the City of London Police. Chakrabarti told \"The Guardian\" Wednesday that Liberty is looking into the matter and may file a complaint with the Independent Police Complaints Commission if it is determined that the City of London Police has a policy on appropriate wording on protest signs which relate specifically to anti-Scientology protests. Freedom of speech campaigners may also call for a judicial review of the legality of the protest guidelines of the City of London Police.\n\"Curtailing people's freedom of speech is a very serious issue and it's important to know whether this is part of the force's policy or a decision relating specifically to the Church of Scientology. There is the possibility of a complaint to the IPCC or a judicial review,\" said Chakrabarti in a statement Wednesday in \"The Guardian\". \"Some people are very easily intimidated and will be put off exercising their right to free speech by the thought that they may face court action over it. We have to defend that right and show how wrong the police were in issuing this summons.\"\nProtesters in Scotland that routinely gather to protest against the Church of Scientology outside the Scientology centre in South Bridge, Edinburgh contacted the City of Edinburgh Council in order to get the Council's input on using the word \"cult\" on signs at anti-Scientology protests. \nIn a statement in \"The Scotsman\" on Tuesday, an Edinburgh County official said: \"I understand that some of the signs you use may display the word 'cult' and there is no objection to this.\" \"The Scotsman\" reported that a representative for the Lothian and Borders Police said that the Scotland police force had \"no issue\" with the use of the word \"cult\" in a peaceful protest. A representative for Liberty spoke positively of the position taken by the City of Edinburgh Council. \"The leadership shown by the City of Edinburgh Council's decision to protect free speech is a positive step,\" said Liberty media director Jen Corlew in a statement Tuesday in \"The Scotsman\".\nThe City of London Police has faced controversy in the past for its close association with the Church of Scientology. When the City of London Scientology building opened in 2006, City of London Chief Superintendent Kevin Hurley praised Scientology in an appearance as guest speaker at the building's opening ceremony. Ken Stewart, another of the City of London's chief superintendents, has also appeared in a video praising Scientology. According to \"The Guardian\" over 20 officers for the City of London Police have accepted gifts from the Church of Scientology including tickets to film premieres, lunches and concerts at police premises. \nUnlike the City of London Police, the Metropolitan Police Service (the territorial police force responsible for Greater London excluding the City of London) has not raised an issue with protesters using placards with similar wording at protests against Scientology, according to \"The Guardian\" and \"Londonist\".\nFilm and television actor Jason Beghe visited a protest organized by members of Project Chanology on Thursday in New York, New York. Beghe joined Scientology in 1994, and gave US$1 million to the Church of Scientology over the course of his membership with the organization. He told Roger Friedman of \"FOX News\" that Scientology head David Miscavige called him \"the poster boy for Scientology\". Beghe appeared in promotional videos for Scientology in 2005. In April 2008 he left Scientology, and contacted Scientology critic Andreas Heldal-Lund, who put him in touch with another critic Mark Bunker. Bunker arranged an interview with Beghe, which was uploaded to Bunker's YouTube account on April 7. The posted video is a 3-minute portion of a larger 3-hour interview with Beghe about his criticism of Scientology. In the video Beghe states: \"Scientology is destructive and a rip-off. ... It\u2019s very, very dangerous for your spiritual, psychological, mental, emotional health and evolution.\"\nBeghe participated in the May 10 international protests against the Church of Scientology, attending the protest in Los Angeles. He met with fellow Scientology critic and former Scientologist Lawrence Wollersheim and spoke with members of Project Chanology.\nApproximately 50 people attended the Thursday protest outside the Church of Scientology of New York building on East 46th Street in New York City. Beghe met with individuals from the group Anonymous and expressed support for what they were doing. \"What you guys are doing means so much to me, and so much to these people ... It just kills me. It makes me want to cry. You don\u2019t know what kind of good you\u2019re doing,\" said Beghe to the protesters.\nAfter meeting with the protesters, Beghe walked across the street to the Church of Scientology building but was blocked from entering by three men standing outside the building. Beghe told \"The Village Voice\" that he believes these individuals were not Scientologists but hired private security guards. He said to the guards \"I paid a million dollars, and I want to go in,\" but was told to go back across the street. When he rejoined the protesters on the other side of the street he called the Church of Scientology asking to speak to the president of the Church of Scientology of New York, John Carmichael, but said \"they hung up\". According to a blog post at \"The Village Voice\" website, Carmichael was caught on video at an anti-Scientology protest held in New York City on Monday telling a protester: \"Let me tell you this: I smell pussy,\" and then addressed an individual protester and said: \"You in particular.\" According to \"The Village Voice\" blog post, the incident occurred after protesters prevented Carmichael from capturing images of them and identifying them, by shining a flashlight at his camera.\nEach of the Project Chanology international protests against Scientology has had a theme: the February protest called attention to the birthday of Lisa McPherson, who died under controversial circumstances while under the care of Scientology, the March protest was arranged to take place two days after Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard's birthday, the April protest highlighted the Church of Scientology's disconnection policy, and the May protest highlighted the Scientology practice of \"Fair Game\" and took place one day after the anniversary of the publication of Hubbard's book \"Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health\". Another international protest is planned for June 14, and will highlight the Church of Scientology's elite \"Sea Organization\" or \"Sea Org\"."}

Lift-off occurred at 21:02:12 GMT this evening, with the ascent to an initial sub-orbital trajectory lasting approximately eight and a half minutes. Orbital insertion occurred shortly afterwards, with a circularisation burn which concluded at 21:42 GMT.\nThis is the third Space Shuttle mission of 2008. STS-124 is the second of three missions to assemble the Japanese Experiment Module, also known as Kibo. The JEM Pressurised Module (JEM PM or JPM) is the largest laboratory module of the International Space Station, and one of the largest payloads ever launched by the Space Shuttle. The main Japanese robot arm, or RMS, will also be launched on this mission. \"Discovery's\" mission is scheduled to last for fourteen days, however it can be extended by two days if necessary. Three spacewalks, or EVAs, are planned to be conducted.\nSTS-124 has a crew of seven astronauts; Mission Commander , Pilot , Mission specialists , , and , and Expedition 17 crewmember Gregory Chamitoff. All crewmembers are American, except Hoshide, who is Japanese. The astronauts were awoken at 11:30 GMT on launch day, and began preparations for their launch. This is the first spaceflight for Ham, Nyberg, Garan, Hoshide and Chamitoff, the second for Fossum, and the third for Kelly. The launch coincides with Kelly's father's birthday.\nPreparations for launch had been underway for several months. The External Tank arrived at the Kennedy Space Center in late March. Following tests in a checkout cell, it was mated with two solid rocket boosters which had been assembled on a Mobile Launch Platform. Discovery was then rolled from the Orbiter Processing Facility to the Vehicle Assembly Building for mating with the External Tank and boosters. Rollover occurred in late April, and was followed by rollout to the launch pad about a week later.\nThe Kibo pressurised module arrived at the Kennedy Space Center in May 2003 by ship. It was then moved to the Space Station Processing Facility. Electrical interface tests with the Harmony node were conducted in August 2003. At the end of April 2008, the module was placed in a transportation canister, and moved to the launch pad. The payload arrived at the launch pad about a week ahead of the Shuttle. Once \"Discovery\" arrived at the launch pad, the module was placed into \"Discovery's\" payload bay. Owing to the size of the payload, there was no room in \"Discovery's\"' payload bay for the Orbiter Boom Sensor System (OBSS), a safety device used primarily to inspect the Shuttle Orbiter's heat shield. As a result of this, \"Endeavour\" left its OBSS at the International Space Station, during the last Shuttle Mission, STS-123. \"Discovery's\" crew will collect this during an EVA.\nFueling of \"Discovery's\" External Tank in preparation for launch began at 11:50 GMT. By 12:50, it had been confirmed that initial tests on Engine Cutoff (ECO) sensors in the External Tank had been conducted successfully. ECO sensor failures had caused a number of delays to recent Shuttle launch attempts, and STS-124 is the first mission to use a modified tank, which is intended to eliminate such faults. At the time at which tanking began, weather forecasters predicted an 80 percent chance of acceptable conditions at the scheduled launch time. Fuelling was completed, and topping up of cryogenic propellant began, at 15:36. In addition to the ECO sensor modifications, this was the first mission to use an External Tank manufactured after the \"Columbia\" accident in 2003, and therefore the first tank to have all safety enhancements built into it, rather than retrofitted.\nThe terminal countdown resumed after a planned hold at T-3 hours, at 17:07 GMT. Crew walkout from the Operations and Checkout building at the Kennedy Space Center occurred at 17:12. Following walkout, the crew boarded a bus known as the \"astrovan\", which was used to transport them to the launch pad. The crew arrived at the launch pad at 17:31, and began boarding \"Discovery\" at 17:38. As Mission Commander, Mark Kelly was the first to board the orbiter. He was followed by Chamitoff at 17:42, Ham at 17:52, Fossum at 17:55, Nyberg at 18:08 and Hoshide at 18:11. Ron Garan was the last to board the orbiter at 18:21. Pad technicians known as the closeout crew, assisted the astronauts with boarding the Shuttle, and getting strapped in. The pad technicians were cleared to close the orbiter's access hatch at 19:02 GMT, and the hatch door was closed two minutes later at 19:04. Sealing the hatch was completed at 19:54.\nA scheduled ten-minute hold at T-20 minutes began at 19:47 GMT. During this hold, the closeout crew put thermal insulation plugs into screwholes on the orbiter's hatch, removed protective covers, and disassembled the white room, a collapsible structure at the end of the crew access arm which is used to access the spacecraft. The countdown resumed at 19:57. At that time, no problems were being worked.\nThe final built in hold, at T-9 minutes and lasting for 45 minutes and 12 seconds, began at 20:08. During this hold, flight controllers set the exact launch time to be 21:02:12 GMT, and confirmed that the launch window would end at 21:08:59 GMT. The countdown was set to resume at 20:53:12. Shortly before the end of the hold, the launch director described conditions as a \"gorgeous day to launch\", and wished the crew \"good luck and Godspeed\". Mark Kelly thanked him, and replied \"whilst we tend to live for today, Discovery, with Kibo, will certainly deliver hope for tomorrow\". Countdown resumed on time at the end of the hold, and the automated Ground Launch Sequencer was initiated.\nWhen giving clearance to retract the Orbiter Access arm from the Shuttle, seven minutes before launch, the Orbiter Test Conductor wished the crew \"best of luck delivering JEM to the International Space Station\". Four minutes before launch, the engines were purged of gasses, and tests of the flight control surfaces began. Liquid hydrogen tanks were pressurised shortly after at T-3 minutes, and the fuel vent cap was retracted. Two minutes before lift-off, the crew were instructed to close and lock their visors, and the liquid oxygen tank was pressurised. At T-50 seconds, the orbiter switched to internal power, and the Shuttle's flight computers took over control of the countdown at T-31 seconds.\nLaunch occurred on schedule at 21:02:12 GMT. The Solid Rocket Boosters separated about 120 seconds into the flight, and around eight and a half minutes after launch, the Main Engines (SSMEs) shut down, and the External Tank was jettisoned. At this time, \"Discovery\" was on a 65km x 217km x 51.6\u00b0 sub-orbital trajectory. Orbital insertion followed about thirty minutes later, with a firing of \"Discovery's\" OMS engines. This burn started at 21:39 GMT, and ended at 21:42, lasting two minutes and 44 seconds.\nAt the time of launch, the International Space Station was flying over the Atlantic Ocean, South-East of Canada. Following launch, a fault was detected with the backup electrical system controlling the left OMS engine gimbal actuator. As it was a backup, flight controllers predicted that it would have no effect on the mission, and all scheduled burns will go ahead. The fault was later traced to the failure of both transducers in the unit, and it was reported that the problem was probably due to an equipment malfunction as opposed to a faulty sensor. When asked about the faulty actuator, NASA Administrator Mike Griffin stated that at the \"worst case it would be a loss of redundancy but we will still be able to use that system\". \"Discovery's\" payload bay doors were opened at 22:35 GMT. At 23:09, the crew were cleared to begin on-orbit operations.\nProcessing and countdown progressed smoothly, and were described by \"Discovery's\" processing and launch flow director, Stephanie Stilson, as being \"a very clean flow\". Mission Commander Mark Kelly remarked that there had been a \"historic low on spacecraft issues\". Around four hours prior to launch, Stilson remarked that there had been 73 anomalies detected so far. The smallest number of anomalies during the countdown for a previous mission was 76, for STS-103.\nMoron AFB in Spain was considered the primary transoceanic abort landing (TAL) site, should an engine failure, or other major problem have occurred during early ascent. Istres in France was considered the backup TAL site. The weather at both of these sites was good, however no abort was required during the launch.\nThis is the 123rd Space Shuttle mission, and the 35th to be flown by \"Discovery\". Ten further missions are planned, including two contingency logistics flights, prior to the Shuttle's retirement in 2010. Discovery is assigned to three of these missions. It is next scheduled to fly in early 2009, on mission STS-119. The next Space Shuttle mission will be conducted by \"Atlantis\", which will fly STS-125, the final mission to service the Hubble Space Telescope. This is the fourth manned, and 27th orbital launch of 2008.\nAt a press conference following launch, NASA Administrator Mike Griffin stated that it was \"a huge day for the space station partnership\", and that the International Space Station was \"a place in orbit where we can learn to live and work in space\". He congratulated JAXA on the launch of the Japanese Experiment Module, saying that \"Japan has now built a first class laboratory...which is capable of supporting humans in space\", and that \"with this step Japan has shown itself to be capable of performing at the highest levels of space exploration\". Griffin also stated the STS-124 is \"an essential step\" in the Space Station programme. When asked by a reporter how he felt about recent NASA successes, including the STS-124 launch, and the landing of the Phoenix probe on Mars last Sunday, he joked that it felt \"so great that not even having to do a press conference, two press conferences in a week can ruin it\". When asked about the difficulty of what NASA was doing, he remarked that flight controllers \"make it look easy\", but \"it is so far from being easy that I could talk until 6am tomorrow, and I wouldn't touch on how difficult it is\".\nNASA Associate Administrator for Space Operations Bill Gerstenmaier said that it was \"a great day for the launch\", and described STS-124 as a \"pretty challenging mission\". Gerstenmair stated that five foam debris impacts had been identified during ascent, but that NASA \"don't consider this a big deal, they were all late\". When asked what he meant by 'late', he explained that after 123 seconds into the flight, pieces of falling foam debris \"can't build up enough velocity to hit the orbiter, or if they hit the orbiter they will just bounce off\" He went on to say that \"things look really well and look really good\", and that NASA have \"no concern\" about foam, \"It's not an issue to us\".\nLaunch Integration manager LeRoy Cain described it as a \"flawless countdown and a flawless launch\". He said that STS-124 is \"a big milestone for us\", and went on to explain that \"this is the most important mission we have going right now\". He also stated that the \"tank's performance looks really good\". \nLaunch Director Mike Linebach stated that it was a \"Fantastic launch\", that was tying for the lowest faults during a countdown, with 74 issues reported. Stephanie Stilson has previously stated that the record was 76 issues, so it is unclear whether STS-124 has set a new record, or is tying with the previous record. Linebach went on to describe the launch as \"outstanding\".\nKeiji Tachikawa, the President of JAXA said that he \"was very delighted to see the Shuttle \"Discovery\" successfully launched\". He stated that the Kibo module would \"significantly enhance the capability to perform experiments in orbit\", and that experiments conducted aboard the Space Station, and the Kibo module, would lead to \"better daily lives for the people of our planet\". He also expressed his \"profound appreciation to NASA, and all international and domestic organisations\" involved in the launch, explaining that the mission is \"very significant to Japan\"."}

Jerry Strickland of the Texas Attorney General's office told the Associated Press that the samples were taken from Jeffs while he awaits trial in an Arizona jail. According to the AP, the DNA search warrant alleges that Jeffs had \"spiritual\" marriages with four girls, ages 12 to 15.\nThe search warrant was filed in Mohave County Superior Court in Kingman, Arizona. Jeffs is alleged to have sexually assaulted one of the 12-year-old girls after their July 2006 \"spiritual\" marriage, and is also alleged to have married a 14-year-old girl in January 2004 who gave birth to a child in October 2005. Police say the girl was believed to be about 15 at the time of conception by Jeffs. \nTexas officials are investigating Jeffs for crimes of sexual assault of a child, aggravated sexual assault and prohibited sexual assault. The search warrant alleges: \"Warren Jeffs sexually assaulted a 12-year-old child ... on or about July 27, 2006, in Schleicher County, Texas,\" according to a copy of the warrant obtained by the \"Deseret News\". \"Based on all of the above, affiant believes that Warren Jeffs has committed the felony offense of sexual assault of a child,\" wrote Kingman, Arizona police officer Dennis Gilbert in the search warrant. Law enforcement officials say that another marriage took place on April 16, 2005 between Jeffs and a 12-year-old girl. \nJeffs is alleged to have \"married\" the children at the FLDS compound in Eldorado, Texas. Marital records known in the FLDS as \"bishop's records\" allegedly document a January 18, 2004 marriage between Jeffs and a 14-year-old girl. The documents were obtained when Texas authorities conducted a search of the FLDS compound in Texas, the Yearning for Zion Ranch, on April 3. According to the \"Fort Worth Star Telegram\" the warrant also alleges that Jeffs married a 14-year-old girl at the YFZ compound on July 22, 2004.\nAccording to the \"Las Vegas Review\", the DNA samples were taken from Jeffs on Thursday afternoon via a cotton swab of the mouth. Kingman police detectives took the sample after Texas authorities asked for help in their investigation of Jeffs. Kingman police executed the search warrant and affidavit of probable cause, and authorities from the Texas Attorney General's office left Thursday with the samples.\n\"Our investigator was out there yesterday collecting the DNA sample after getting the search warrant signed,\" said Texas Attorney General's office spokesman Jerry Strickland in a statement Friday to the AP.\nIn a statement Saturday in the \"Deseret News\", Rod Parker, a Salt Lake City, Utah attorney and FLDS spokesman questioned what evidence law enforcement possessed which could show possible criminal actions by Jeffs. \"The question is, do they have any evidence of sexual activity with minors and Warren Jeffs? I don't know if they do or not. I don't see how DNA, by itself, proves that one way or another.\"\nPhotos of Jeffs pictured with underage child brides were shown in court last week in an FLDS custody case in Texas. The photos show Warren Jeffs kissing and hugging young girls, and attorneys for Texas Child Protective Services claim that one of the girls shown in the photos is a 12-year-old \"bride\". The photos are dated from July 2006 and January 2005. \nJeffs is seen in one set of photos from January 26, 2005 labeled \"First anniversary\" with a girl called \"Loretta\". In another set dated July 27, 2005, Jeffs is shown with a girl referred to as \"Merrianne\". Child Protective Services officials said that they have evidence that \"Merrianne\" was 12 years old when she was married to Jeffs at the YFZ compound. \"The Vancouver Sun\" reported that, per a family member, \"Loretta\" was no older than 12 when she was married. \nThe investigation into alleged abuses committed by Jeffs is separate from the custody case involving the FLDS in Texas. Texas Supreme Court upheld the decision of the appellate court to overturn a lower court ruling which led to the removal of over 400 children from the FLDS compound by Texas authorities in early April. The appellate court had said that Child Protective Services did not show that the children faced an immediate danger if they were not removed.\nAttorneys for CPS had asserted that DNA tests required to confirm parentage were still pending and that parents could take their children back from Texas jurisdiction if they regained custody. The appellate court justices stated that child welfare officials can take other actions to protect the children if necessary, and that the district judge in the case could still place restrictions on the parents and children to assure that they would not flee the state. Texas District Judge Barbara ruled Friday that the 38 mothers involved in the legal complaint which went to the appellate court must first sign an agreement drafted by child welfare officials and the FLDS attorneys before their children are returned to them.\nWarren Jeffs was convicted in September 2007 of two counts of being an accomplice to rape related to a 2001 wedding he arranged between a 14-year old girl and her 19-year old cousin. He was sentenced to two consecutive five-year prison sentences in Utah, and faces an impending trial in Arizona on eight charges including sexual conduct with a minor, incest and conspiracy. After his convictions in Utah he was turned over to Arizona authorities to await trial there. He faces charges in Arizona of five counts of sexual conduct with a minor, four counts of incest and one count of conspiracy to commit sexual conduct with a minor.\nThe FLDS group has approximately 10,000 members total, and was founded in the 1930s. It split from the The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) after the LDS Church abandoned the practice of polygamy in 1890."}

According to a WHO press release, studies show that young people are more likely to start smoking if exposed to tobacco advertising. The WHO notes that only five percent of the world population \"is covered by comprehensive bans on tobacco advertising, promotion and sponsorship\". \n\"The WHO appeals to member states and policy-makers to require by law a comprehensive ban on all forms of advertising, promotion, and sponsorship of tobacco products,\" said WHO Regional Director for Africa Luis Sambo, in a statement released Saturday in Kampala, Uganda.\n\"In order to survive, the tobacco industry needs to replace those who quit or die with new young consumers,\" said WHO Director-General Dr. Margaret Chan. \"A ban on all tobacco advertising, promotion and sponsorship is a powerful tool we can use to protect the world\u2019s youth.\"\nThe WHO said that tobacco companies are specifically targeting the half billion youth in the Asia Pacific region by tying smoking to the idea of a flashy lifestyle. The agency said the tobacco industry attempts to take advantage of children's susceptibility to advertising and marketing.\nAccording to the WHO most people take up smoking before they reach age 18, and almost twenty-five percent of smokers worldwide are under the age of 10. The agency said that a survey of 13 to 15 year-olds found that fifty-five percent had seen cigarette ads on billboards in the prior month, and twenty-percent owned something with a cigarette company's logo.\nAccording to BBC News, in the last ten years female and adolescent smoking in Russia has tripled. Russia does not have many anti-smoking laws. \"BBC News\" compared this to Canada, where smoking levels are at their lowest in 40 years and the country has very restrictive laws on smoking advertising.\n\"The tobacco industry employs predatory marketing strategies to get young people hooked to their addictive drug. But comprehensive advertising bans do work, reducing tobacco consumption by up to 16% in countries that have already taken this legislative step,\" said Dr. Douglas Bettcher, Director of WHO's Tobacco Free Initiative. \nA report by the WHO on tobacco use stated that approximately two thirds of the planet's smokers reside in 10 countries including China, India, Indonesia, Russia, the United States, Japan, Bangladesh, Germany, and Turkey. Reuters reported that companies Philip Morris, Imperial Tobacco, British American Tobacco and Japan Tobacco are among the world's largest producers of cigarettes."}

Included in the administration deal are Silverjet's subsidiaries Silverjet Aviation Limited, Skylease Limited and Sky People Limited, all of which are wholly owned by Silverjet.\nSilverjet shares are suspended from trading at the London Stock Exchange and it is feared that shareholders may receive nothing from their investments.\nSilverjet is the latest all-business class airline to collapse recently. US rivals Maxjet and Eos Airlines have both been forced out of business by high fuel costs, driven by the rapidly increasing price of crude oil.

Scientists received the images on Friday May 30 from the craft's robotic arm camera. The image was taken on the fifth Martian day, or Sol 5.\nScientists say that as Phoenix landed, the exhaust from its thrusters cleared away a three to four inch layer of Martian soil which exposed a flat layer of a white substance, that NASA says could be ice. The image shows the white layer which is shiny and smooth.\n\"It's the consensus of all of us that we have found ice. We were expecting to find ice within two to six inches of the surface. The thrusters have excavated two to six inches and, sure enough, we see something that looks like ice. It's not impossible that it's something else, but our leading interpretation is ice,\" said top Phoenix investigator at the University of Arizona in Tucson Peter Smith.\nOne exposed edge of the underlying material was seen in Sol 4 images, but the newer image reveals a greater extent of it. The abundance of excavated smooth and level surfaces adds evidence to a hypothesis that the underlying material is an ice table covered by a thin blanket of soil. Tests will be performed on the soil and surrounding area to determine exactly what the substance is.\n\"We could very well be seeing rock, or we could be seeing exposed ice in the retrorocket blast zone. We'll test the two ideas by getting more data,\" stated Ray Arvidson, one of the mission investigators.\nPhoenix is searching for evidence of water and microbial life on Mars. Its mission is to determine Mars's ability or inability to host life and hold water. The Phoenix lander uses a robotic arm to dig through the protective top soil layer to the alleged water ice below and ultimately bring both soil and water ice to the lander platform for sophisticated scientific analysis.

His exit from the church's congregation came as media reports revealed that guest speaker of the church and Catholic priest Reverend Michael Pfleger went on a tirade on the pulpit declaring that Hillary Clinton believed she was entitled to the \nDemocratic presidential nomination because she is white.\nObama had been criticized since March 2008 when media reports showed his longtime pastor declaring on the Sunday following the September 11 attacks that the violence was a result of America's support of \"state terrorism against the Palestinians and black South Africans.\" Many more were appalled when Wright declared \"God damn America\" in a later sermon. \nThe pastor had an impact on Obama earlier in his life, and was once described as his spiritual guide. He married Obama and his wife Michelle, and baptized their two children. It was Wright's sermon that influenced Obama to write his biographical book \"The Audacity of Hope\". Obama remained a member of the church following the reports but separated himself from the comments in a speech on race entitled \"A More Perfect Union\" delivered on March 18, 2008.\nDespite the speech, polls early in May revealed that Obama's favorability fell from 50 to 45% because of Wright's comments. Wright had resigned his post yet the criticism remained. The final piece in Obama's eventual exit from the church came when Reverend Pfleger, a friend of Obama, mocked Hillary Clinton during a sermon stating, \"'I\u2019m Bill\u2019s wife, I\u2019m white and this is mine'...And then out of nowhere came, 'Hey, I'm Barack Obama,' and she said, 'Oh, damn! Where did you come from? I'm white! I'm entitled! There's a black man stealing my show!'\" \nIn his announcement that he was leaving the church, Obama remarked, \"I make this decision with sadness...This is where I found Jesus Christ, where we were married, where our children were baptized. We are proud of the extraordinary works of that church...I\u2019m not denouncing the church, and I\u2019m not interested in people who want me to denounce the church.\"\n&lt;br&gt;"}

In addition, police arrested Eric Matinenga, an MDC legislator and lawyer to the opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai.\nArthur Mutambara was arrested at his house in Harare on Sunday, for writing a newspaper article critical of President Robert Mugabe. The April 20 article was published in \"The Standard\", Zimbabwe's only privately-owned Sunday paper. It criticized the actions of the courts, judicial officials, and Mugabe's party in the March 29 elections, and accused Mugabe of using violence and vote rigging to leave the opposition \"bludgeoned and brutalized.\"\nOn May 8, \"The Standard\" editor Davison Maruziva was arrested for publishing Mutambara's article. Maruziva was charged with publishing false statements prejudicial to the state and for contempt of court, the same charges now being held against Mutambara. \"The Standard\" has been critical of Mugabe and of the violence that followed the elections.\nThe BBC says Mutambara is the most senior opposition leader to be arrested so far. His lawyer, Harrison Nkomo, does not expect him to appear in court until Tuesday. \"I am only expecting him in court on Tuesday as no questioning will take place today,\" Nkomo said. \"The questioning will only start tomorrow.\" Nkomo says Mutambara is being detained in a Harare police station, which the constitutional court has allegedly deemed \"unsuitable for human habitation\".\nThe Movement for Democratic Change broke into two factions in 2005, following a dispute over whether to contest Senate elections. Mutambara led a breakaway faction of nearly half of MDC's parliament members, until the March 29 elections left his faction with 10 seats against Tsvangirai's 99. Mutambara subsequently agreed to join forces with Tsvangirai, although no official merge has taken place.\nEric Matinenga, an opposition legislator and lawyer to MDC president Morgan Tsvangirai, was arrested Saturday in the eastern district of Buhera. He was charged with inciting public violence, said MDC spokesman Nelson Chamisa. Matinenga, who was elected as a member of parliament in the March 29 elections, is the fifth MDC legislator to be arrested. He is due to appear in court on Monday, according to Chamisa.\n\"The whole campaign is to render the MDC comatose but it is not going to work,\" Chamisa said. \"This run-off is between the people and a dictatorship represented by Mugabe.\"\nThe March 29 elections had the ruling Zimbabwe African National Union \u2013 Patriotic Front (ZANU-PF) party lose its majority in parliament for the first time since Zimbabwe gained independence in 1980. The results showed Tsvangirai with more votes than Mugabe in the presidential race, but neither won an acceptable majority, forcing a run-off to be held on June 27."}

A reporter, a photographer and a driver - all employed by the newspaper - were working undercover on a story about the rule of such groups in a poor community known as Batan, in the western area of Rio, when they were found out by the criminals and kept captive for seven and a half hours.\nAccording to the newspaper, all three were subjected to electric shock, asphyxiated with plastic bags, and beaten several times.\nThe next morning, they were released by their captors under threat of death if made any denunciations. Prior to that, however, the reporter managed to send text and photos to the newsroom, by email from a wireless computer.\nThe kidnapping and torture happened May 14 to 15, but the news organization decided to postpone its printing for safety reasons. The heads of police and public security in the state government, however, had been immediately informed. The story was only printed today, as the denounce came to public, after officials assured the primary investigations had begun and those held responsible were already identified.\nThe identities and whereabouts of the news workers are being kept secret.\nAccording to the story as it was printed, the kidnappers insisted they were not criminals, but policemen who were acting \"ahead of justice\". They are said to govern the community under a \"reign of terror\", by imposing curfews, banning funk parties, and charging dwellers and small business for \"protection\". \nThe same militiamen also have a scheme to elect politicians committed with them, by making lists of voters who live in each favela, with name and electoral registry number for each one, and barring other candidates from campaigning within the neighborhood. Connection with Christian (Neo-Pentecostalist) churches were also cited.\nThe case brought calls for defense on press freedom and safety for reporters by journalists and civil rights entities in Brazil.\n\"At the moment when journalists are doing their job in a favela, to take information to society, and they are brutally tortured, it puts democracy under jeopardy\", Jos\u00e9 Carlos Torves, board member of National Federation of Journalists (FENAJ), said.\n\"For the Brazilian Press Association (ABI), besides the uncomfortable solidarity we think we must offer to these fellows, there is also the need to claim from authorities, from the State, the strict investigation of such facts\", demanded the chairman of such entity, Maur\u00edcio Az\u00eado.\nThe board of \"O Dia\" said they will be taking this case to the annual congress of the World Association of Newspapers, held this week in Sweden.\nLow-income communities in Rio de Janeiro are generally ruled by bands of drug lords since mid-1970s, a situation which has continuously deteriorating since then. Heavily armed drug dealers have taken control in most favelas of Brazil's second largest city, where their power often overrules that of the government.\nIn reaction, over the last two years such 'militias' have been formed to counter these mafias. Groups of former police officers, firemen, private security agents and civil servants vow to fight drug traffic, but impose the same kind of violent methods against the local population.\n\"It's worrying to know, according to these professionals account, that there would be police officers involved. This is really serious. It's unacceptable\u201d, said Wadih Damous, from the Brazilian Bar of Lawyers (OAB).\nOrganized crime in Rio is known for extreme violence and cruelty. On June 2nd, 2002, a reporter for TV Globo (the main broadcaster in Brazil) was also kidnapped and killed while working on a story about sex exploitation of children in another favela. According to the police, Tim Lopes was taken by drug dealers, tortured, burned alive, then had his body quartered. He was 52 years old. The killers, known as Elias Maluco and Ratinho, were later arrested and sentenced to more than 30 years in prison."}

At least three fire companies started battling the blaze, which engulfed the entire warehouse, sending a plume of smoke into the air which could be seen for several miles, at one point darkening the sky. All 12 firefighters are being treated at Erie County Medical Center, but their conditions are not known. At least 80 firefighters were reported to be on scene along with a total of nine of the 19 fire companies in Buffalo. Firefighters were still on scene as of 9:15 a.m. EDT (UTC-4) today, nearly 24 hours after the fire started.\nThe fire started at the \"Leisure Living Pool Supplies\" warehouse at 1130 Niagara street between West Ferry and Albany streets behind the Rich Products building at around 10:30 a.m. Monday and was not brought under control until 6:30 a.m. today. The warehouse is three floors tall. Firefighters had the fire under control just before 12:00 p.m. Monday, but wind off Lake Erie reignited the fire at around 3:00 p.m. At around 7:00 p.m., most of the blaze was under control, but smoke could still be seen coming from the building. All employees from both Rich's and the chemical company have been sent home for the day and made it out safely. The building is owned by \"PoolSupplies.com\" which is a division of \"Leisure Living\", selling supplies, recreation and chemicals for swimming pools. \"Leisure Living\" is a company of \"Island Pools\". \nAt 9:00 p.m., firefighters reported that most of the fire was contained under the collapsed portions of the building, but around 10:00 p.m. firefighters reported that more thick black smoke started to rise from the building. Black smoke usually indicates burning, whereas white smoke often indicates water putting out a fire. Firefighters are using a helicopter, courtesy of the Erie County Sheriff's Department, that is equipped with infrared cameras in order to see the areas of the building which still contain a significant amount of heat or fire.\nAfter having fought the fire for over 24 hours, fire officials stated that the fire was mostly extinguished and ordered fire companies to start shutting down the hoses and pack up their equipment. Just before 1:00 p.m. the fire command post stated that fire investigators were on scene and that \"they can call us (firefighters) back if they need anything.\"\nOfficials have urged all residents near the blaze to stay indoors and to shut all windows and doors due to the smoke which has been blowing close to the ground. At least one civilian who was inside a park at the foot of Ferry was also taken to the hospital for smoke and chemical inhalation. Officials were able to evacuate the park and no other injuries were reported. At one point, the sun was blocked by the black smoke rising from the building.\n\"The fire reignited again sometime this afternoon. It appears it reignited due to the earlier collapse of the roof and the winds off the lake. Right now, one thing fire officials would like to get out and stress is anyone in and around the Niagara and Ferry area, if you could please go indoors, and shut your doors,\" stated Michael DeGeorge, a spokesman for the Buffalo Police Department, to reporters. DeGeorge also stated that no residents have been evacuated.\nThe northbound lane of the I-190 expressway, which lies just to the west of the warehouse, was closed at the Porter Street exit at the Peace Bridge to the exit leading to the 198 expressway for several hours. At 11:15 p.m., firefighters stated they would begin to reopen the lane. Niagara street from Albany to West Ferry reopened to normal traffic in the late morning hours of Tuesday.\nThroughout Monday afternoon and early evening, employees of \"Marco's Restaurant\" on Niagara and Albany were providing ice and beverages to firefighters and police officers who were on scene. Temperatures were quite warm, in the upper 70's (F), with winds gusting to nearly 15-20 MPH, coming out of the southwest. Although the wind assisted in reigniting the fire, it also assisted firefighters by quickly clearing the area of smoke.\nThe warehouse is a storage and distribution facility for pool chemicals, especially chlorine. Chemical drops could be felt flying through the air, which also had the smell of bleach. According to a source who spoke to \"Wikinews\" on condition of anonymity, the warehouse contained over US$8 million in supplies and chemicals.\nEarlier tests performed on the air by firefighters and Haz-mat officials had shown that the smoke and fumes rising from the fire are not dangerous or toxic. Further tests were performed, but those results are not yet known and officials don't believe there was any danger to the air. Officials will testing the water runoff from fire hoses to make sure that it is not contaminated as it is emptying into the Niagara River. The warehouse is located just down stream from a drinking water pumping station with several more scattered along the River from Buffalo to Niagara Falls.\nThe cause of the fire is not known and is under investigation. Last year, on May 14, 2007, at least five buildings that were part of a warehouse complex about 1/3 of a mile from \"Leisure\" caught fire, and required nearly 130 firefighters to battle the blaze. Smoke from that fire was seen over 40 miles away."}

In the song, Lennon proposes the hypothetical \"Imagine there's no heaven ... and no religion too\".\nOn April 23, 2008, Lennon's widow, Yoko Ono, along with his sons Julian and Sean, and music producer EMI Blackwood, Inc., filed suit against Premise Media seeking damages for alleged copyright infringement, as the song had not been licensed to appear in the film. On May 19, a preliminary injunction was issued, preventing distribution of the film. On June 2, Judge Stein of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York ruled that the fair use defense would likely succeed if it went to court, and lifted the injunction. In his judgement, he wrote that \"the fair use of a copyrighted work for the purposes of criticism and commentary is not an infringement of copyright\".\n\"Expelled\" is a documentary that claims that Intelligent Design proponents are being suppressed by the majority of the scientific community. It has received criticism from many scientists and film critics, and has also faced copyright claims over animated sequences that resemble the short animation The Inner Life of the Cell, produced by XVIVO and Harvard University.\nIn a statement Ono commented that \"it is a pity that this decision weakens the rights of all copyright owners\". She plans to appeal the decision."}

The arrests follow a joint investigation between the DEA and the Monmouth County Prosecutor's Office, dubbed \"Operation Unbounded\", which ran for 14 months following a tip-off received by the DEA about a drug ring running out of the \"quiet suburbia\" of Manalapan.\nAccording to Monmouth County Prosecutor Luis Valentin, the drugs were smuggled into the country on commercial flights from countries including Mexico and Colombia, and delivered via ground transport to New Jersey, Florida, Georgia and elsewhere in the United States. Authorities believe the operation was headed by Vicente Esteves, 35, and his wife Chantal, 30. The couple has been arrested and is being held in the Monmouth County Jail in Freehold. Mr. Esteves's bail is currently set at US$10 million, and his wife's at US$5 million.\nGerard McAleer, special agent in charge of the DEA's New Jersey division, compared the Esteves's opulent lifestyle to that in the movie \"Scarface\". In their multi-million dollar Manalapan home, McAleer noted, were \"walk-in closets where there were 100 pairs of Prada shoes, still in the boxes.\"\nAccording to New Jersey newspaper \"The Star-Ledger\", the operation transported more than 1,000 kilograms of cocaine and earned its operators US$1 million per month, while the Associated Press puts the figure at US$1 million per week. Authorities arrested one of the seven defendants boarding a commercial flight from Newark to Miami in possession of US$100,000, and have since seized cocaine with a street value of US$2 million, and US$2 million in cash."}

Obama will be the first black candidate ever to stand for the United States presidency with the backing of a major political party. \n While Obama needed another 40 primary delegates coming into Tuesday's final two primaries to secure the nomination with the required 2,118 total, he was considered to be likely to achieve this through the primaries in Montana and South Dakota. However, due to the superdelegates that have gone in favor of Obama, he has achieved the needed count ahead of today's primaries. According to two anonymous Clinton campaign officials, the New York Senator believed that Obama, the junior Senator from Illinois, had done enough to win the Democratic nomination.\nHillary Clinton's campaign has denied reports that she will concede the Democratic Party of the United States primary campaign to Barack Obama during a speech tonight in New York City.\nThe \"Associated Press\" first reported that two campaign officials stated she would announce her concession tonight. In a statement to the press, Clinton's campaign commented in two sentences: \"The AP story is incorrect. Senator Clinton will not concede the nomination this evening.\"\nInterviewed on CNN today, Clinton's campaign manager Terry McAuliffe called reports of concession \"100 percent incorrect,\" but stated on NBC's \"Today\" that once Obama reached the crucial delegate count of 2,118, Clinton would congratulate him and \"call him the nominee\". She also told NBC that, \"until someone has that magic number, we're going to continue to fight for literally those 17.5 million people.\"\nOn Monday, former President Bill Clinton was quoted as saying that \"this may be the last day I'm ever involved in a campaign of this kind. I thought I was out of politics, till Hillary decided to run. But it has been one of the greatest honors of my life to be able to go around and campaign for her for president.\" President Clinton's aides later downplayed the statement.\nThe decision not to terminate Clinton's campaign officially was observed to give her a bargaining and leverage tool with Obama on various matters, up to and including the possibility of Clinton being Obama's vice presidential candidate. Speaking on conditions of anonymity, a Clinton campaign official stated that all Clinton campaign staff would be paid through June 15.\nCalled the \"Comeback Girl\" for her ability to come from behind to win states when the primary campaign showed Obama beginning to take both delegate and popularity leads, Clinton had campaigned late into Monday night for the chance of still taking a final come-from-behind victory in the final two primary elections. But today, Obama took the nomination ahead of the time frame analysts had predicted.\nThe Barack Obama campaign website has reported that there are 31.5 more delegates required before Obama receives the nomination. \nA news report released by the Boston Globe has claimed that the Clinton Campaign is indicating that \"she [Clinton] will gracefully exit the stage and won't take her fight to the convention.\" Sources close to Clinton hinted that if asked, she would be willing to serve as Obama's running mate."}
