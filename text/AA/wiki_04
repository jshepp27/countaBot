As the center does not have sea level gauges outside the Pacific, they will not be able to detect or measure a tsunami if one occurs. It can be assumed the danger has passed if no tsunami waves are observed near the epicenter within an hour of the earthquake.\"\nThe US Geological Survey's Waverly Person told the BBC that the event was \"unlikely to spark a tsunami\".\nThe Thai TV station MCOT was reporting at around 1:00 (local time, UTC+7) that everything was under control and there has been no confusion; in Phuket and Trang provinces, the sea level was reported to be at normal levels at that time. At 1:25 (local time), the Thai National Disaster Warning Center cleared the tsunami warning nationwide.\nThe top federal administrator of the Nicobar Islands, Ram Kapse, told Reuters news agency that there had been no reports of casualties or damage from any of the inhabited islands."}

But poor weather conditions affected the finale.\nThe official race time clock was stopped when the riders reached the Champs Elysee due to rain making the famous cobble stones slippery. However, the rain stopped and the stones dried during the eight final laps of the famous road, and time-bonuses were awarded for the stage win. \nAlexandre Vinokourov of Kazakhstan, riding for T-Mobile, won the stage after his break-away from the field 1,500m out could not be reeled in by the peloton, relegating the sprinters to lower placings. The 20s time bonus moved Vinokurov to fifth overall in the race.\nAs Armstrong was presented the final Yellow Jersey, he was quoted in the press as saying in a mixture of French and English, \"\"Vive le Tour\", forever.\" The winning Yellow Jersey is awarded to the cyclist who had the best overall performance throughout the tour's circuit.\nAfter the awards ceremony, Armstrong discussed what comes next in his life, mentioning that defeating cancer by raising awareness and funds is his new goal.\n\"We know how to train and prepare for the Tour,\" he says. \"If we win, it is a success. Cancer is not and will not be that way. It is a different kind of fight. It's not something that lasts three weeks.\n\"Along the way there will be victories and defeats.

The move came despite a compromise deal agreed last week between RPA and the Burundian authorities. \nBurundi's National Communications Council (CNC) had ordered the indefinite suspension of RPA on July 15th, claiming that its coverage of recent elections had been biased, and that the radio station had insulted them. The station's Director Alexis Sinduhije rejected the allegations, and Burundian media groups accused the CNC of acting as a tool of political repression. Following negotiations, the authorities lifted the indefinite ban, after RPA agreed to a 2-day suspension. \nRPA went off air on Monday July 18th. Broadcasts were resumed on Thursday morning, but less than 48 hours later the authorities were attempting to shut down the station again. \nBujumbura journalist Gregoire Wakana, writing on the African news website abarundi.org, reported a tense stand-off outside the radio station on Friday afternoon, as around 30 soldiers, led by Colonel Ildephonse Mushwabure, tried to gain entry. \"The suspense lasted several hours, and a large crowd gathered, with several Burundian journalists coming to watch the fate of their RPA colleagues\". \nAbarundi.org reports \"widespread indignation\" over RPA's closure, with onlookers shouting angrily at the authorities as they moved in on the station. Some later threw stones at a nearby building owned by the Burundian President Domitien Ndayizeye. \nAbarundi.org notes that Colonel Mushwabure is a controversial figure in Burundi, after giving contradictory statements to a UN inquiry over his whereabouts during the 1993 coup led to the assassination of the country's first democratic president, Melchior Ndadaye. Last month's elections were the first since the coup, which plunged Burundi into more than a decade of vicious, ethnically-charged civil war. \nEarlier this week, the head of the UN's electoral unit in Burundi praised the country's media, saying it had \"masterfully played its role of democratic watchdog by helping Burundians to allay their fears and go to the polls\".\nThe dispute between RPA and the Burundian government has been monitored by the international press freedom watchdog the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ). \n\"RPA fell silent around 5 p.m. local time as police broke into the station compound, padlocked its studios, and cut off its transmitter. It was not immediately clear if any RPA staff had been arrested, although one journalist told the CPJ in a brief phone call, \"they are taking us to the police station\", they announced in a press release on Friday. \n\"No one is above the law. Sanctions must be taken against whoever breaks the law... African Public Radio continues to show its lack of respect towards the authorities\", the National Communications Council chairman Jean-Pierre Manda was quoted by Reuters as saying on Saturday.\nThe council had accused RPA of giving disproportionate coverage to the opposition FDD party in recent elections. \nThe FDD heavily defeated President Domitien Ndayizeye's FRODEBU party, gaining a majority of seats in the country's National Assembly, with 58% of the popular vote. The party is now expected to form the next government.\nAbarundi.org reports that the men who broke into the radio station were unable to produce any kind of warrant. RPA's director Alexis Sinduhije told Reuters he had evidence Ndayizeye issued the order to shut down the radio station, calling it \"an abuse of power\". \n\"If they (the communication council) believe I have insulted them, they must go to court, but not punish the radio and the public audience,\" Reuters quoted him as saying.\n\"CPJ is outraged at the Burundian authorities' failure to deliver on their promise,\", said CPJ Executive Director Ann Cooper, in a press release. \"We call on President Ndayizeye to ensure that RPA can resume broadcasting immediately, allowing journalists to work freely without fear of reprisal.\"\nQuoting Burundi National Radio and Television, BBC monitoring has reported that President Domitien Ndayizeye met representatives of a media organization on Saturday to discuss the reopening of Radio Publique Africaine.\nThe president reportedly decided to close the radio in order to \"safeguard the integrity of state institutions.\""}

However, in the last few years, the correlation between consumer confidence and actual retail sales has been questioned since consumers were spending money even when survey figures said they wouldn't."}

He's an 18-year-old lad, quiet as a mouse, on his own, going back to a Bulgarian jail. What's he going to do? As far as the Bulgarians were concerned, a local lad had been attacked and they wanted their scapegoat. They did not care that Graham Sankey has confessed to carrying out the attack. They just tossed that aside.\"\nThe family have said they will do everything in their power to clear Michael's name. Meanwhile, Liverpool Riverside MP Louise Ellman, has backed the family's campaign calling the incident a \"travesty of justice\".\n\"Graham Sankey has admitted he was guilty of the crime that Michael Shields is now convicted of, but he did so in a way that was inadmissible to the Bulgarian court,\" added Mrs Ellman, who is planning to speak to his defence team.\nA British Foreign Office spokesman said it could not comment on the verdict but said it would continue offering consular help to Michael Shields.\nBulgarian government officials have since agreed to begin the process of releasing Michael Shields, in exchange for the arrest of Graham Sankey.\nThe development came after long-time justice campaigner Stephen Jakobi held closed talks with Bulgarian ambassador Lachezar Matev at the Bulgarian Embassy in London.\nMr. Jakobi announced that Michael could be free in the next \"few months\".\n\"It's been a good day and we have achieved an important breakthrough.\n\"We have got an agreement with the Bulgarian government that they are going to take up our proposed course of action - that is issuing an arrest warrant for Graham Sankey.\n\"The government is independent of the judiciary in that country but they can hold talks with them to get the ball rolling as soon as possible.\n\"The arrest warrant will means the extradition process will begin.\"\nHome Secretary Jack Straw has also agreed to meet with Shield's family to discuss the situation with them."}

Gemstar-TV Guide International, the corporate parent of the magazine says the current format of the magazine has caused it to become unprofitable.\nThe changes will be effective with the October 15 issue. Lack of profitability has been a point of contention between Gemstar management and its largest shareholder, Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation. \nIncluded in the new design is a shift away from detailed listings to more of a \"People\" or \"Entertainment Weekly\" celebrity-focused format. Included in that change will be the elimination of the 140 localized editions of \"TV Guide\" in favor of one national publication with only \"Eastern\" and \"Pacific\" times listed for program listings. \nThe magazine's owners noted that with the advent of digital cable and satellite TV, more viewers rely upon electronic program guides provided free by the television service provider than printed listings.\nTV Guide officials say the current magazine is made up of 25 percent news content printed on glossy paper and 75 percent TV listings printed on newsprint and in black-and-white. The new version of the magazine will be completely four-color and on glossy paper. Additionally, the news-to-listing ratio will flip with 75 percent of future content being feature articles on celebrities and television programs.\nA second change will be the magazine's size as it moves from a digest-sized publication to a full-sized glossy. The company expects the larger edition will be more profitable against competition such as \"People\" and \"US Weekly\". But that profitability may be at the expense of national reach.\nAlthough the magazine is getting physically larger, according to reports, the readership is expected to shrink. Gemstar expects many of is subscribers not to renew with the new format. Currently the TV Guide guarantees 9 million subscribers to its national advertisers. According to reports, it is only guaranteeing 3.2 million subscribers to its revamped publication once it hits newsstands."}

He was 83.\nChibitty was among the 14 Comanches who landed with the D-Day invasion of Normandy Beaches where they reported by radio to division headquarters on the progress of the landings. The Comanche were dubbed \"code talkers\" because the American Indian language has no written record, and it was never broken by the Germans during the war.\nOne of the first messages transmitted in Comanche language during the landings was \"right beach, wrong place\". It warned soldiers they landed about a half mile from their intended target. Chibitty served with a unit that landed on Utah Beach on June 6, 1944.\nMr.Chibitty served with the rank of a Corporal in the 4th Infantry Division that engaged in the breakthrough of the Siegfried line in Hurtgen Forest. His division also saw action in the Battle of the Bulge and the rescue of the \"Lost Battalion\". His division was among the first to undertake the liberation of Paris. Then later, the 4th Infantry was the first to enter Germany.\nThe Comanches, who came from the Lawton area in Oklahoma, heard rumors of a military plan to organize a native speaking unit. He enlisted in 1941, and along with 19 others, they were trained for special duty by the U.S. Army Signal Corps. All were sent to Fort Benning, but three remained state-side because they had dependents and deployment in the mission was dangerous.\nThe U.S. declassified the code talker program in 1968. Only three remained living at the time. The French Government gave special honors to the Comanches by bestowing them with the Chevalier of the National Order of Merit in 1989. Mr. Chibitty was honored in 1999 when the Pentagon bestowed on him the Knowlton Award.\nIn a 1999 interview with the Armed Forces Information Center, Chibitty said: \"The Navajo did the same thing. The Navajos became code talkers about a year after the Comanches, but there were over a hundred of them because they had so much territory [in the Pacific Theater] to cover.\"\nJoe Holley of the \"Washington Post\" recalled this quote from Mr. Chibitty in 2002: \"It\u2019s strange, but growing up as a child I was forbidden speak my native language at school. Later my country asked me to. My language helped win the war, and that makes me very proud. Very proud.\"\nThe funeral service was held Tuesday at 10 a.m. He has three surviving grandchildren.\nSources.\n "}

In the past, Dr. Tewolde has disagreed with Canadian scientists on proposed methods to regulate GM products.\n\"Dr. Tewolde is one of the most respected scientists in his field,\" said Pat Mooney, representative for the conservationist ETC Group in Ottawa, \"If the Canadian government can't make sure Dr. Tewolde has his visa for the opening of the meetings, Canada does not deserve to host the Convention on Biological Diversity.\"\nDr. Tewolde himself is concerned that Canada's actions signal a pattern, \"Now that I have been prevented from coming to Montreal, who knows which ones of you will be prevented next time?\" he wrote.\nThis closely mirrors another more recent incident where 12 Ugandans (mainly youths) were denied visas by the Canadian High Commission in Kenya. After making two applications and having met all the requirements asked by the commission, the Ugandan delegation was still denied visas."}

David Dinenna, said he attended in September 2003 a meeting with Maj. Gen. Geoffrey D. Miller, who was then commander of the Guantanamo Bay prison camp. Maj. Dinenna said Gen. Miller recommended using dogs, because of their effectiveness. \nTwo dog handler soldiers at Abu Ghraib stand accused in the hearing. Sgt. Santos A. Cardona, 31, and Sgt. Michael J. Smith, 24, are alleged to have used the dogs to threaten and intimidate prisoners. During the defendants' testimony on Tuesday, they said the interrogation techniques used by them on prisoners was learned from a team of interrogators that was dispatched to Iraq from the Guantanamo Bay military base in Cuba.\nThe Article 32 military court proceeding, which concluded Wednesday in Fort Meade, Maryland, is a preliminary hearing to hear prosecution and defense arguments in the case. The Prosecution is seeking a court-martial with claims that the defendants acted criminally. The Defense contends the soldiers were following orders, and that the charges should be dropped.\nThe investigating officer of the military court, Maj. Glenn Simpkins, has two weeks to weigh the evidence that was presented. Some or all charges could be dropped, but if some charges stand, he will make a recommendation on how Sgts. Cardona and Smith should be dealt with when it goes to trial.\nThe two accused said in yesterday\u2019s testimony that Col. Thomas M. Pappas, the top military intelligence officer at Abu Ghraib, approved the use of the dogs. Testimony was also heard from Pvt. Ivan L. \u201cChip\u201d Frederick, now serving an 8-year sentence in Fort Leavenworth for his role as ringleader in the abuse, who testified by phone from prison that approval was given to use the dogs, and that a civilian interrogator was also sometimes involved in directing which prisoner cells were to be visited by dog handlers.\nIn addition to the use of dogs, aggressive interrogation techniques such as clothing removal and sleep deprivation were also part of the series of abuses. Staff Sgt. James Vincent Lucas previously had told Army investigators in Guantanamo that he left Cuba in 2003 to go to Iraq where he, as a member of a 6-man team, taught the \u201clessons learned\u201d at Guantanamo, and served to \u201cprovide guidelines\u201d to interrogators at Abu Ghraib. \nLegislation sponsored by several Senate Republicans seeks to specifically regulate the treatment of prisoners at Guantanamo and other military prisons. A co-sponsor of the bill, Lindsey Graham (R-SC), recently released declassified internal memos dating from 2003 and written by top military lawyers. They warned the Pentagon about the aggressive tactics at Guantanamo. The memos noted it would heighten the dangers for U.S. troops caught by the enemy.\nArmy charge sheets accuse Cardona and Smith with maltreating detainees from November 15, 2003, to January 15, 2004 by \"directing, encouraging, or permitting [their] unmuzzled military working dog[s] to bark and growl at detainees in order to unlawfully harass and threaten the detainees and in order to make the detainees urinate or defecate on themselves.\"\nCardona, of Fullerton, with the 42nd Military Police Detachment in Ft. Bragg, N.C., was charged with nine counts. Smith, of Fort Lauderdale, Fla., with the 523rd Military Police Detachment in Ft. Riley, Kan., was charged with 14 counts."}

This represents the largest offshore program since 1995-96\"\nMr Goudkamp criticised the minister over recent scandals.\n\"Vanstone is in hot water over Cornelia Rau, Vivian Solon, the Hwang children and upwards of 200 other cases of wrongful detention,\" he said.\n\"Now we hear that Mahabub Alam, a Bangladeshi student with a valid visa, was subjected to a search without a warrant, arrest, interrogation and incarceration by immigration officers.\"\n\"Vanstone addressing this forum is sheer hypocrisy. Her reputation as immigration minister is beyond repair. John Howard seems to be the only person in the country defending her.\"\nHe also called for the resignation of Senator Vanstone and her predecessor, current Attorney-General Phillip Ruddock.\n\"She must step down, taking Philip Ruddock, who was the hardline minister when many of these debacles occurred, with her,\" he said.\nThe Department also recently released figures on its skilled migration program, emphasising the benefits to the Australian economy, while not compromising other programs such as family reunion. \n\"The 77,880 skill stream migrants in 2004-05 account for about 65 per cent of the total program. At 120,060, the overall Migration (non-Humanitarian) Program was the largest since the late 1980s,\" Senator Vanstone said.\n\"The Government's focus on skilled migration continues to benefit Australia\u2019s economy, while it maintained a sizable level of family reunion,\" she said.\nThe rally will begin at the Market St entrance of the Queen Victoria Building at 5:30pm."}

Ndayizeye is due to relinquish power in August. \nThe radio station's Director, Alexis Sinduhije, had denied the CNC's charges. President Ndayizeye was quoted by BBC monitoring as saying that he had decided to close the radio station to \"safeguard the integrity of state institutions.\"\nThe closure of RPA was condemned in Burundi, where the radio station, founded in 2001 to promote reconciliation between the Hutu and Tutsi ethnic groups, has a wide following. The US-based \"Committee to Protect Journalists\" led international condemnation of the ban, which Burundi's \"Collectif des Professionels des M\u00e9dias de la Diaspora Burundaise\" described as an \"abuse of power\", setting up an online petition in protest. \n\"The National Council of Communication judged that RPA has respected council sanctions, but we have also allowed the radio to reopen because a lot of people requested it,\" CNC chairman Jean Pierre Manda told Reuters, earlier this week.\nManda has now resigned, although he denies that the move is connected with the row over RPA, and cites \"personal reasons\". The Committee to Protect Journalists reports that the CNC is to be reformed, with Radio Publique Africain's Deputy Director sitting on the board in future. \nThere is some confusion over when the ban was lifted, with Reporters Sans Frontieres and the Committee to Protect Journalists reporting that it remained in place until Wednesday this week, while Reuters claims that the ban was lifted on Monday. \nRPA Director Alexis Sinduhije has told Reuters that some of the radio station's material has been destroyed by the Burundian police, and suggested that broadcasting will not resume until a damage inventory has been taken.\nThis week's row is merely the latest manifestation of a long-running personal dispute between President Ndayizeye and the RPA Director Alexis Sinduhije, says journalist Gratien Rukindikiza, writing on the Burundian news website Burundi.news.free.fr. Rukindikiza traces the root of the affair to a telephone call last year in which Ndayizeye tried, unsuccessfully, to persuade Sinduhije to endorse his campaign, through Radio Publique Africain, to amend Burundi's constitution. The amendment would have allowed Ndayizeye to seek a second term in power, in contravention of a 2003 peace agreement. "}

Every Volunteer is aware of the import of the decisions we have taken and all \u00d3glaigh are compelled to fully comply with these orders.\nThere is now an unprecedented opportunity to utilise the considerable energy and goodwill which there is for the peace process.

The deal was signed after nearly a year of secret negotiations. The deal does not - as yet - contain targets for reducing emissions.\nEnvironmental groups have condemned the deal, claiming that, as it is not legally binding, it is no substitute for the , which the US and Australia refuse to sign. China and India - along with some 140 other countries - have already ratified the Kyoto agreement, but did not have to set a target for reducing gas emissions due to their status as developing countries. The Kyoto Protocol has the firm target of reducing emissions by 5.2% on 1990 levels before 2010.\nAnswering critics, the Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer said, \"We are not trying to detract from Kyoto and the commitments that a number of countries have made under the Kyoto Protocol. This partnership will complement and not replace the Kyoto Protocol.\"\nThe Australian Prime Minister John Howard also said that his country should not pursue renewable technologies, but should instead concentrate in reducing emissions from the use of coal. Australia is the world's largest exporter of coal, and Howard said that \"Australia [should not be] unreasonably penalising herself by saying, in effect, we're going to try to move away from the use of fuels in which Australia has a natural advantage.\"\nHowever part of the deal includes setting up a fund to further research cleaner energy technologies, including more efficient use of fossil fuels as well as renewable technologies, and also methods of trapping and storing greenhouse gasses rather than releasing them to the atmosphere. It is hoped that this will aid China, India and other developing countries to adopt cleaner energy solutions.\nThe details will be worked out at a meeting between the six countries in November, shortly before the next UN summit on climate change.\nThe countries believe the deal is fairer and more effective than the Kyoto Protocol. However, a Greenpeace spokesperson said, \"The suggested scheme is, unlike Kyoto, a voluntary scheme, and all evidence shows that voluntary schemes do not work. Skulking around making secretive, selective deals will not accomplish a reduction in emissions .\"\nThe has warned that global temperatures could rise by 1.4C to as much as 5.8C by 2100. The US and China are the two biggest producers of carbon dioxide (a major greenhouse gas) in the world."}

Astronomers from the Palomar Observatory near San Diego, California said they found a chunk of ice and rock in the solar system larger than Pluto.\nThe object, given the temporary generic name of 2003 UB313, is about 9 billion miles away from the sun. It was first photographed in 2003 using the Gemini Observatory in Hawaii. But it was an indistinguishable bright spot among a field of stars in an area of the sky where astronomers don't usually look at for planets or planet-type objects.\nSolar system bodies found beyond the orbit of Neptune are called \"trans-Neptunian objects\". One of them, Pluto, is also classified as a planet. Up until now all other planet-like discoveries beyond Neptune, including Sedna, found by the same Palomar team in 2004, are called Kuiper Belt objects, or minor planets.\nSize matters.\nUsing a photo taken on January 8, the Palomar team compared it with previous 2003 UB313 photos to triangulate the object's distance, brightness and orbit.\nUsing mathematical formulas, they found a range of sizes for 2003 UB313, with an estimated average showing the approximate diameter of the new body to be about 2,600 kilometers. But even at the smallest estimate scientists are certain 2003 UB313 is larger than Pluto's 2,250 kilometer diameter.\nTo determine size, Scientists deduce the relative size of a solar system object by its brightness, just as one can infer the size of a faraway light bulb if one knows its wattage. The reflectance of 2003 UB313 is not yet known for sure. Scientists can not yet tell how much light from the sun is reflected away from its surface, but the amount of light the planet does reflect puts a lower limit on its size.\n\"Even if it reflected 100 percent of the light reaching it, it would still be as big as Pluto,\" Michael E. Brown, a professor of planetary astronomy at the California Institute of Technology said in a NASA press release. \"I'd say it's probably one and a half times the size of Pluto, but we're not sure yet of the final size.\"\n\"We are 100 percent confident that this is the first object bigger than Pluto ever found in the outer solar system,\" Brown added.\nWhy wasn't it discovered earlier?\nThe object is inclined by a whopping 45 degrees to the main plane of the solar system, where most of the other planets orbit. That's why it eluded discovery: nobody was looking there until now, Brown said.\nMost objects in the solar system are just a few degrees from the main plane of the solar system, called the Ecliptic. Pluto, which is considered substantially different from the rest of the planets, is only 17 degrees from this main plane. Astronomers who study the sky for asteroids and comets usually look in the region of the sky that the rest of the planets occupy.\nThe brightness of this object is just barely fainter than the telescopes from earlier sky surveys were able to identify, so new advances in the making of telescopes has also played a part in this discovery.\nThe name.\nNow that the discovery data has been released, the scientists will turn over their work to the International Astronomical Union (IAU), which will review it, classify the object and approve a new name to replace the temporary 2003 UB313. \nSometimes the discoverers of a new planetary body get to choose its name, but not always. \"We have a name we really like, and we want it to stick,\" Brown told reporters at a press conference. He said the team has submitted the name to the IAU but would not disclose their choice. In the 2004 naming of Sedna, Brown noted objects found in the Kuiper Belt are usually named after deities of the Underworld. \nThe astronomers have been using a code name of sorts for the discovery. The tongue-in-cheek nickname is \"Xena\" after the fictional main character of the television series of the same name. \"Because we always wanted to name something Xena,\" Dr. Brown said in a \"New York Times\" report.\nDefining 'planet'.\nThere has been controversy in the scientific community about what is and what is not a planet. Some purists insist the Solar system has only eight planets and that Kuiper Belt object including Pluto, Sedna and 2003 UB313 cannot be listed among the major planets.\nA minor furor erupted when the IAU suggested removing Pluto from the pantheon of planets a few years ago. Because of that Pluto's status as a \"planet\" in addition to being a Kuiper Belt object was cemented. But with the discovery of 2003 UB313 the \"planet or not\" debate may rekindle.\n\"Pluto has been a planet for so long that the world is comfortable with that,\" Brown said in the teleconference. \"It seems to me a logical extension that anything bigger than Pluto and farther out is a planet.\"\nOffering additional justification, Brown said 2003 UB313 appears to be surfaced with methane ice, as is Pluto. That's not the case with other large Kuiper Belt objects, however.\n\"This object is in a class very much like Pluto,\" he said.\nA second object found.\nThe new \"10th planet\" was not the only new discovery in the Kuiper Belt this past week. Jos\u00e9-Luis Ortiz at the Sierra Nevada Observatory in Spain announced the discovery of an object called 2003 EL61. This object, thought to be larger than Sedna, is the brightest trans-Neptune object next to Pluto.\nAlthough some news media confused the discovery of 2003 EL61 with 2003 UB313, they are different objects.\n2003 EL61 is so bright, it can be seen with high-end amateur-grade telescopes equipped with CCD cameras. Although this second discovery may not be as large as 2003 UB313, scientists have confirmed that 2003 EL61 has its own moon."}

They complain that the AFL-CIO has spent too much money on backing political candidates, particularly Democrats, instead of organizing labor.\nUFCW President Joe Hansen wrote to AFL-CIO President John J. Sweeney saying: \"Tradition and past success are not sufficient to meet the new challenges.\"\nAFL-CIO spokeswoman Lane Windham responded, saying \"The UFCW leadership decision to leave the AFL-CIO, especially when working people are up against the most powerful, anti-worker corporate and governmental forces in 80 years, is a tragedy for working families. Only unions' enemies win when unions split our strength.\"\n\"The unions that split from the AFL-CIO now face the challenge of having to work together to maximize the power of labor,\" predicted Harley Shaiken, a professor of labor issues at UC Berkley.\nTheir clearest difference is in how they want a national labor organization to operate, Shaiken said. The breakaway unions favor a more authoritative federation that can compel member unions to act on its directives.\nThe departure is part of the biggest rift in organized labor since 1938, when the CIO split from the AFL. \nWhen the groups merged to form the AFL-CIO in the 1950s, one of every three private-sector workers belonged to a labor union. Today, fewer than 8 percent of private-sector workers are unionized."}

Bolton appeared with him and spoke briefly. \"I am profoundly grateful and deeply humbled,\" Bolton said. \"It will be a distinct privilege to be an advocate for America's values and interests at the U.N.\" \nThe President can make an appointment without the approval of the Senate while the Congress is in recess, but the term of such a \"recess appointment\" expires at the end of the Congressional session.

The New York Times reports the letter was signed by 36 senators -- 35 Democrats and one Independent. \nSome senators, including Republicans, have raised questions regarding Mr. Bolton's history of criticizing the United Nations, his treatment of subordinates, and over charges that he has tried to influence intelligence assessments to conform to his views, the Times reports. \nDuring confirmation hearings, Republican Senator George Voinovich described Bolton as \"the poster child of what someone in the diplomatic corps should not be.\" Because of Voinovich's opposition, Bolton's nomination was sent to the floor of the Senate without a recommendation.\nReactions.\n\"At a time when we need to reassert our diplomatic power in the world, President Bush has decided to send a seriously flawed and weakened candidate to the United Nations,\" said Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid of Nevada. \"The reason Bolton is being recess appointed is because the president chose to stonewall the Senate. Mr. Bolton could have had his up or down vote had President Bush given senators the information they needed.

Manchin acted in retaliation against the company\u2019s coal mining operations because the company spent $650,000 in an advertising campaign to defeat the governor sponsored pension bond proposal. The $5.5 billion bond proposal, intended to shore up the state's sagging pension plan, was defeated in a special election held in June.\nThe Massey lawsuit, filed last Tuesday on July 26 in the U.S. District Court in the W.V. southern district, was referred to by Gov. Manchin as having less to do with the bond proposal than with the newly increased state \"severance tax\" on coal. Nearly 40 million tons of coal production will be subject to the 56-cent tax. \nAccording to Blankenship, that tax amounts to $22.4 million in additional costs for the company, but he denied the increase has anything to do with the lawsuit. \nThe company reported profits that almost tripled during the second quarter compared to a year ago. Of the company\u2019s rosy earnings picture, Blankenship urged states to \u201cshow some frugality\u201d by not placing tax burdens on coal to solve state budget shortfalls. He said his company is \u201cplaying a role\u201d because there was no need for the bond sale and the state can afford to make payments into the pension system. \nBlankenship acknowledged during a conference call the now-rescinded June 30 permit by the W.V. Department of Environment Protection (DEP). At issue was the department's permit for mining operations near the Marsh Fork Elementary School, in Sundial, W.V. The school rests at the base of a mountain selected by Massey for \"Mountain Top Removal\" (MTR) mining techniques. Along with the mining equipment, a coal preparation plant and a sludge pond were established on the mountain. Protest groups, mainly the \"Coal River Mountain Watch\" and \"Mountain Justice Summer\", presented a list of demands to Massey officials that included shutting down the preparation plant, ceasing all MTR mining above the Marsh Fork Elementary School, and abandoning plans for a second coal silo near the school. They also ask that the Marsh Fork school be cleaned up or relocated. The state permit for a second coal storage silo was rescinded by the DEP the same day Massey filed the Manchin lawsuit.\nGov. Manchin in June said that Blankenship could expect tougher state scrutiny of his business affairs since the Massey media campaign against the pension bond proposal. \"I think that is justified now, since Don has jumped in there with his personal wealth trying to direct public policy,\" he said at an appearance at an American Electric Power event in Putnam County."}

This daily gathering has drawn both the ire and compassion of the Herndon community. A public hearing Monday night to discuss a new plan drew an overflowing crowd to the Town Council chambers. The Commission said so many people signed up to speak at the hearing that the panel will need to convene again Tuesday night.\nFor years groups and businesses among the community who want to help the day laborers have been working on the issue. In a plan spearheaded by Bill Threlkeld, of the group Project Hope and Harmony, they lobbied Herndon officials to use taxpayer money to build a regulated day laborer center in an old police station at the edge of town. This they say would get the day-laborer group(s) off the street. The plan has the backing of Herndon mayor, Michael L. O'Reilly.\nThe plan would also combine the opening of the center with a new local ordinance that would make it a misdemeanor crime for a laborer to seek work at any location other than the official one. Opponents of the plan say the town would be aiding illegal immigrants if it established the center. \nA Pew Hispanic Center survey found a 25% increase over four years in the number of illegal immigrants in the U.S. The number now is estimated to have reached about 10.3 million. Local governments do not have the authority to enforce national immigration laws, so the town of Herndon must rely on federal officials, who show little interest in getting involved."}

The research confirms that the silk protein used for the egg case is different than that used in spider webs. Spider silks are renowned for their superior material properties, being among the toughest known natural\nfibers. The researchers' findings may lead to new applications of spider silks for novel\nhigh-tech materials. The researchers, Jessica Garb and Cheryl Hayashi, published their findings in the \"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences\" on August 1, in the early edition of the journal.\nUntil now, the sequence of the silk protein used to construct the egg case was unknown. The team characterized the egg case silk protein from multiple spider species and found within a species its gene was composed of nearly identical, repeating sequences. The repeat units were also similar across species that diverged more than 125 million years ago. Their findings suggest that the egg case silk gene has been undergoing what is known as concerted evolution where mutations in one part of the gene \"spread\" to other parts of the same gene, creating a highly repetitive gene sequence.\n\"The protein of the egg-case fibers has a different function altogether from that of the other silks such as dragline or capture silks,\" Garb said. \"Egg-case silk has to last a long time and therefore must be durable under a wide variety of conditions, from freezing to very high temperatures. It needs to be strong enough to protect the eggs from threats such as predators, parasites and molds.\"\nAlthough the egg case silk protein is extremely different, its gene sequence shares certain features in common with all other spider silk genes. According to Garb, this discovery confirms that spider silk genes comprise what is known as a \"gene family\". This means that silk genes first evolved with spiders approximately 400 million years ago and subsequently evolved into different genes specifically used for different functions, such as genes for spider webs or genes for egg cases (Gatesy et al. 2001). The researchers also suggest that there are many more silk genes that remain unknown, particularly as there are more than 37,000 known species of spiders, and silk genes sequences have been described from only a few species. \nAccording to the team, this unknown diversity of silk genes may not only be important for understanding spider evolution but also for the development of genetically modified fibers. \"Collectively, spider silks are some of the toughest natural fibers known,\" Hayashi said. \"Imagine a fabric made from such a substance? It would be incredibly strong, flexible and ultimately, biodegradable.\""}

The security officer of Shefa-Amr, Jamal Aliam reportedly told Army Radio that Zada had been attacked by dozens after he had been handcuffed and subdued by police. Police were unable to control the mob, which wounded 5 officers. Magen David Adom ambulances evacuated the wounded to Rambam Medical Center in Haifa.\nNatan-Zada had been absent without leave from his army unit since mid-June after refusing to participate in preparations for the Gaza pullout. He moved to Kfar Tapuach, a West Bank Jewish settlement dominated by the militant Kach movement. His father Yitzhak Natan-Zada urged Eden to return his weapon and informed the army that his son was dangerous. Eden's mother Debbie, speaking from the family home in Rishon LeZion was told that someone must be AWOL for 45 days to be officially considered a deserter and was advised to go herself to Kfar Tapuah to disarm her son.\nEden had recently become more fanatical and encountered writings on the Internet about revenge and zealots in Judaism published by the outlawed terrorist Kach group in \"The Way of the Torah\". He befriended people from Tapuah over the Internet and apparently became involved in resistance to plans to remove Jewish settlers from territory slated to be turned over to Palestinian control.\nWhen called up into the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) for basic training in May 2005 Natan-Zada went reluctantly, then refused to obey an order and was briefly imprisoned. He spurned advice to seek a psychiatric discharge under Section 21 of military regulations. According to his father, \"When they told him to set up a tent city [next to Kibbutz Re'im] in opposition to his views, he deserted and went to Tapuah.\""}

From the anchor desk or from the field, Jennings covered more than 40 years of national and international news including the erection and destruction of the Berlin Wall, the fall of apartheid, the demise of communism in Europe, the millennium, and the September 11 terrorist attacks.\nJennings was honored with numerous awards for journalism, including 16 Emmys, two George Foster Peabody Awards, several Alfred I. duPont-Columbia University Awards and several Overseas Press Club Awards. \nJennings told viewers back in April in a taped message that he had lung cancer and was going to start chemotherapy treatment for it. He stated he would continue to host \"World News Tonight\" when it was possible, although he never again appeared on the broadcast. During his absence, Charles Gibson and Elizabeth Vargas filled in for Jennings. It is unknown who will replace Jennings at this time.\nJennings first broadcast experience came at age nine, when he hosted his own radio show for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. Following many years of reporting from the Middle East, Jennings began appearing on \"World News Tonight\" in 1978, and became its sole anchor in 1983. During the 1980s and early 1990s, the broadcast became the most popular network news program in the US, surpassing the CBS Evening News in 1986. Jennings followed in his father's footsteps: Charles Jennings served as Canada's first network news anchorman on the CBC.\nA native of Canada, Jennings became a U.S. citizen in 2003. He is survived by his wife, Kayce, his daughter, Elizabeth (25), his son, Christopher (23), and his sister, Sarah.\nSoon after he died his wife, Kayce Freed, issued this statement: \"Peter died with his family around him, without pain and in peace. He knew he'd lived a good life.\""}

Located in the east central United States, the 579-kilometer-long (360 mile) cave is the longest known in the world. Despite its length and a 200 year exploration effort, only eight natural entrances have been located into the vast underground system.\nThe entrance was discovered in September 2003, and a route to known sections of Mammoth Cave was first discovered in March. The actual connection was made at 11:55 p.m. Central Standard Time, March 18, 2005 (4:55 UTC, March 19, 2005) by veteran cavers Alan Canon, John Feil, Dick Market, and James Wells. The latest mapping adds four kilometers (2.5 miles) to Mammoth Cave's total length.\nAlan Glennon, a cave scientist at the University of California, Santa Barbara, describes the find as \"exciting\". \"Such significant discoveries show that we've still got a lot to learn about places right under our feet\", he said. \nExploration of Mammoth Cave is conducted by the Cave Research Foundation and Central Kentucky Karst Coalition. Both groups' membership is open to experienced cave surveyors. The explorers note that the new entrance is located far from the developed, tourist trails within Mammoth Cave National Park.\nMammoth Cave is located at 37.186\u00b0 N 86.100\u00b0 W."}

Edmonton's health authority ordered people not to swim, boat or rescue animals in the lake and to stop using its water or any water from nearby wells for cooking, drinking, showering or brushing teeth. These warnings came 3 days after many residents, including children, had been wading into the oil slick without protective clothing to save wildlife injured by the spill and others had been routinely depending on the lakewater for home use. Why the alert was not issued sooner remains under investigation and may result in criminal charges.

On several occasions, the U.S. has been told that its calculating methods were not valid. A NAFTA report of August 13, 2003 said the U.S. made a mistake in calculating its duties based on U.S. prices, and by not taking Canadian market conditions into consideration, and ordered Washington to recalculate them. NAFTA decisions are legally binding and must be put into effect within 60 days. \nTwo weeks later, a WTO panel concluded that the U.S. wrongly applied harsh duties on Canadian softwood exports. They also found that provincial stumpage programs provide a \"financial benefit\" to Canadian producers. However, the panel made it clear that the benefit was not enough to constitute a subsidy, and did not justify the U.S. duties.\n\"We are extremely pleased that the ECC dismissed the claims of the United States,\" said Canada's International Trade Minister Jim Peterson. \n\"This is a binding decision that clearly eliminates the basis for U.S.-imposed duties on Canadian softwood lumber. We fully expect the United States to abide by this ruling, stop collecting duties and refund the duties collected over the past three years,\" he said. \nNegotiations between Canada and the U.S. are expected to resume next week.\nWhile there have been suggestions that the ruling could bring the softwood dispute to an end after more than four years, the issue may not be resolved. The United States could still file legal challenges outside of NAFTA. \nThe United States has been collecting duties on Canadian softwood lumber since May 2002, after American lumber producers accused Ottawa of subsidizing lumber exports."}

Greenpeace arrived with four fast moving out-board motor boats, manned by thirteen activists, who attempted to drive away the fish. The Coast Guard was called in and ended the confrontation peacefully.\nThe -based Omega Protein Corporation is the largest processor and distributor of protein-rich menhaden and fish oil products in the United States. The company accounts for nearly 90% of the entire East Coast menhaden catch.\nAn Omega spokesman Toby Gascon said of Greenpeace, \"They have now demonstrated that their real agenda is to put Omega out of business, even if it means risking the safety of Omega's fishermen.\" Their fleet is out of Reedville, Virginia, now a top U.S. fishing port due to the recent Omega processing plant opened there.\nChesapeake Bay menhaden are considered an important food source for fish species popular with sports fisherman. They are also, next to oysters, a prime in bay waters. The bay oyster population has suffered drastic declines from disease over the last two decades. Studies of menhaden populations are still inconclusive as scientists try to determine the overall number of bay menhaden.\nGreenpeace says the species is near historic lows and predators that depend on the fish as a food source, such as , show signs of suffering from malnutrition and poor body condition. \nThe \"Chesapeake Bay Foundation\", a not-for-profit organization, had praise for Maryland Governor , and the state's Department of Natural Resources. They secured a commitment from the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission (ASMFC) to seek a cap on commercial harvesting of Atlantic Menhaden. \nA coalition of recreational anglers and environmentalists, called \"Menhaden Matter\", also joined the debate by saying coast-wide population of Atlantic Menhaden has fallen to near record lows. They are also against an encroachment by Omega into Chesapeake waters.\nThe issue is a cap proposed by ASMFC on the menhaden harvest. The Board recommended a Draft Addendum to limit the menhaden harvest to 110,400 metric tons, which is the average over five years of consecutive declines in harvests for the species. The limit would apply to Atlantic and in-land waters of the species. The proposed cap is for years 2006 and 2007 and open to public debate.\nASMFC recently rejected an offer by Omega that would voluntarily cap their harvest at 135,000 metric tons annually for the next four years. They noted Omega also seeks to reopen some waters in Maryland and New Jersey which are currently closed to industrial purse seine operations. A public hearing is scheduled in Alexandria, Virginia in the next few days.\nOmega says that ASMFC's own reports indicate the population levels of Atlantic menhaden are healthy.\nA \"Chesapeake Bay Foundation\" senior scientist, William J. Goldsborough, said, \"I believe that a cap on the purse seine catch of menhaden at current levels, covering the total catch as well as removals from Chesapeake Bay, would be a prudent measure to adopt.\""}

Company officials said the truck was destined for Oklahoma. \nWitnesses said Mr. Stewart appeared to lose control of the truck after entering a curve in the road at a high rate of speed. Utah Highway Patrol Lt. Ken Peay said, \"speed was a factor\" in the wreck of the truck but refused to speculate on how fast the truck was traveling when it wrecked. Lt. Peay said the posted speed limit on the road is 60 mph, but the advised speed is 40.\nAt least 17 people received minor injuries and the explosion left a 35 foot deep crater in the highway. The driver was transported via helicopter to a hospital, where he was listed in fair condition, and was later released. The co-driver Troy Lysfjord, 37, of Blackfoot, Idaho, was helped from the wreck by passers by and listed in fair condition at Utah Valley Regional Hospital in Provo.\nThe wreck site occurred on a major thoroughfare between Denver and Salt Lake City - about 60 miles south of Salt Lake City - was already under reconstruction by nightfall, as road crews began installing 10 inches of asphalt on the two lane road. \nUtah Department of Transportation spokesman Tom Hudachko said officials hoped to have the road fully repaired by Friday afternoon, adding that, \"When you take a look at that hole that was there 24 hours ago, I think it's amazing the progress that was made.\" As of press time, the mouth of the canyon was reopened to traffic, while traffic at the accident site was impassible, and rerouted nearby. \nThe explosion consumed all but about 60 pounds of explosives, and loosened some boulders on the north side of the highway, damaged railroad tracks and some fiber optic lines buried along the roadway.

UN investigators suggest that Rwandan and Congolese milita groups may also have been involved in the attack. The FNL later claimed that the refugee camp was a military base. The UN has found no evidence for this claim, and human rights groups pointed out that nearly half of the dead were children.\n2,000 people, including survivors and relatives of the dead, today attended a memorial service in Burundi, Reuters has reported. \n\"What happened on August 13 was a genocide... One year after the massacre nothing has been done... We demand that justice be done\", Banyamulenge spokesman Binagana Amon is quoted as saying. Amon also criticised the United Nations for its \"silence\" over the attack. \nThe London-based \"International Action Network on Small Arms\" (IANSA) today paid tribute to the 156 victims of Gatumba, who included a local member of the organisation, Pastor Jaques Rutekereza. \n\"His deep faith gave him the courage to face his awful death, and the death of those he loved, with dignity and courage\", IANSA said last year, in a statement honouring Rutekereza. \"The world has lost a great man. It has lost a man of peace.\"\nRutekereza died with six of his children, according to IANSA. \nMembers of the Congolese diaspora have been active in the commemorations. The community in Portland, Maine has organised a weekend of events, including public testimonies from those who lost loved ones in the attack, and a talk by John B. Robinson, who helped produce the film \"Hotel Rwanda.\"\n\"We can't forget them\", Georges Budagu told the Portland Press Herald. \n\"We want to make sure the United Nations and the United States use their influence to bring those people... to justice\". Three of Budagu's cousins died in the massacre. \nThe UN, in turn, asked the Burundian authorities to do more to pursue the perpetrators:\n\"In the name of the victims, and as part of the effort to end impunity for the killings and massacres that have plagued this region for too many years, we urge the Government of Burundi to complete its investigation, issue the report of its findings and bring those responsible to justice.\"\nThe UN also repeated its call for Burundi to involve the International Criminal Court in the investigation. Previous efforts had stalled due to opposition to the Court within the UN Security Council.\nFollowing the FNL's admission of responsibility for Gatumba, the Burundian government produced international arrest warrants for the group's leaders Agathon Rwasa and Pasteur Habimana. Regional heads condemned the group as a terrorist organisation, with South African's President Thabo Mbeki likening the FNL's ideology to that of the Nazis. Yet when Rwasa held a press conference in Tanzania in May, no attempt was made to arrest him. A ceasefire deal signed soon afterwards broke down within days. \nBurundi's refugee minister Francoise Ngendahayo today said that her government is committed to seeing justice for the victims of Gatumba. \n\"Those responsible will be arrested but Burundi cannot do this work alone, we need the collaboration of the DR Congo and the UN\", she told Reuters.\nBurundi's President-elect recently suggested that the FNL could be allowed to join his government. Some analysts believe that offering the group an amnesty might help bring peace to Burundi. Others argue that this could make the situation worse.\n\"For reasons of diplomacy, people are sitting at the exact same table as war criminals, and in some cases granting them immunity. If the atrocities are to end there must be at least some indications that justice will be done\", Human Rights Watch spokesman Stephan Van Praet told Reuters, in the aftermath of Gatumba.\nAction Contre Genocide's Emmanuel Nkurunziza today criticised the UN for what he called a \"paradoxical\" response to the massacre. Despite widespread international condemnation of the attack, the UN representative in Burundi Carolyn McAskie held face-to-face meetings with the FNL in Nairobi earlier this year.\n\"There was no repentance from these killers prior to the meeting; nonetheless, she went on to relay their so-called demands\", he said.\nLocal media recently reported 300 civilian deaths at the hands of the FNL during June and July. An estimated 300,000 people, mostly civilians, have died in Burundi since civil war broke out in 1993. "}

The head of the Criminal Justice, formerly occupied by Christopher Wray, has been empty since May. \nFlanigan is facing tough questioning during his Senate Judiciary Committee confirmation process. Senator Arlen Specter (R-PA) said he is unsure whether he would vote for his confirmation. Flanigan's role in the aggressive interrogation techniques used on detainees from Afghanistan and Iraq and his ties to lobbyist Jack Abramoff are being probed."}

All on board perished. The plane was travelling from Larnaca, in the southeast of Cyprus (Greek:Kypros, \u039a\u03cd\u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2) and scheduled to arrive in Prague after a stop in Athens.\nIn-flight events.\nImmediately after take-off, the pilots reported a problem with the air conditioning system of the aircraft and requested to stay at a low altitude. A few minutes later, the pilots alerted the station that the problem had been fixed and requested permission to ascend. This information however has been denied by the Director of Helios Airways. As the plane approached Athens, all communication abruptly ceased, and the plane never issued a mayday distress signal. Two Greek F-16 military aircraft were assigned to observe the plane. The pilots of the F-16s noted that one airliner pilot appeared to be unconscious and the other was not in the cockpit.\nCBC reported the following: \nOn Wednesday [August 17, 2005], state-run and private media, quoting anonymous defense ministry officials, said the two fighter pilots saw someone in the cockpit take control of the plane, which was flying in a gradually descending holding pattern apparently on autopilot. That person, probably a man who experts say must have had flight training, then banked the plane away from Athens, lowering it to 2,000 feet and then climbing back up to 7,000 feet before the plane apparently ran out of fuel and crashed. \nThe F-16s accompanied the airliner until it crashed.\nPossible malfunctions and causes.\nThe Greek F-16 pilots saw at least one of the aircraft's pilots may have become unconscious before the crash, causing control of the plane to be lost. The emergency oxygen masks were also reported to have dropped.\nThere had been speculation that an electrical fire or some other cause could have flooded the cabin with carbon monoxide or another gas that would render the passengers unconscious. However, the chief coroner of Athens, Greece, said that tests showed none of the passengers or crew had carbon monoxide in their blood. It was also speculated that the air-supply system of the aircraft may have failed, causing a loss of air pressure within the cockpit. This malfunction can cause a steep drop in air temperature. On December 16, 2004 the same aircraft made an emergency landing after failure of the ventilation system at 35,000 feet and 3 passengers were hospitalized. However, an airline spokesman insisted that the plane was airworthy when it took off.\nTests showed that at least 26 people on the flight were still alive when it crashed. \nAfter a cabin decompression occurred onboard a Learjet carrying golf pro Payne Stewart in 1999, all the travelers lost consciousness and the plane eventually crashed with no survivors.\nPassengers.\nHelios Airlines was unable to supply a complete passenger list, having only first initials and surnames available for investigators. \nThe official passenger list released by Cyprus Police, as reported by CNA, indicates that there were 22 young persons onboard aged 4-16. Most of the passengers were Cypriot, a small number were Greek and one of the pilots was German. There were 4 Armenian passengers who lived in Cyprus.\nThe complete list, in Greek, has been published by the Cyprus News Agency.\nPost-crash events.\nAfter the crash, a fire started around the airliner. It was extinguished by firefighters after 2 hours. The fire burned most of the bodies that are now being collected by special firefighter units and transferred to the city of Shisto, near Athens. Meanwhile, the two F-16 pilots were transferred to Ministry of Defense to give their report.\nThe flight data recorder has been recovered. The cockpit voice recorder was found the following morning in bad condition. The two devices will be sent to Paris for examination.\nNektarios-Sotirios Voutas reported that a passenger (his cousin) sent a text message that read: \"The pilot has turned blue [in the face]. [F]arewell we're freezing\". He was arrested the following day as it appeared to be a hoax .\nReactions from Helios Airways.\nHelios has informed the relatives of the victims; however, the company has been met with criticism for failing to release the passenger list quickly.\nHelios Airways released a statement on their website today, stating, \"Our thoughts are with the families of those on board at this difficult time.\"\nAn emergency telephone number in Nicosia, Cyprus can be contacted at +357/70003737, 22 \u2013 446146.\nOfficial reactions.\nThe Cypriot government has declared three days of national mourning and ordered flags to be lowered on half-mast.\nUpon allegations brought by the Communications and Works Minister and the chief of police, warrants were issued by the attorney general to search Helios Airways offices \nTimeline.\n\"Cyprus and Greece are UTC+3, Czech Republic is UTC+2.\"\nAbout Helios Airways.\nHelios Airways was founded in 1999 as Cyprus' first private airline. It is now a subsidiary of Libra Holidays Group of Limassol, Cyprus and is registered in Cyprus. Helios' remaining fleet consists of 2 Boeing 737-800 jets and an Airbus A319. Helios offers flights between Cyprus and London, Athens, Sofia, Warsaw, Dublin and Strasbourg."}

David Lange was Prime Minister for just five years in the mid-1980s, but his administration left an indelible mark on the nation economically and socially, and also reoriented its foreign policy. \nLange, 63, died of renal failure at 10 p.m. on August 13, a day after his family decided to discontinue artificial life support. He had fought a long battle with multiple ailments. In 2002, he was diagnosed with amyloidosis, a rare and incurable blood disorder. Lange defied his doctors' initial predictions that he had only four months to live, and following a round of chemotherapy, appeared to rally for a time, but in mid-2005 his condition took a sudden turn for the worse. He entered hospital in Auckland in mid July, 2005, to undergo nightly peritoneal dialysis and battled end-stage kidney failure. On August 2, he had his lower-right leg amputated without a general anaesthetic, as a result of diabetes complications.\nHis declining health resulted in the publication of his memoir \"My Life\" being brought forward to August 8. He lived to see this happen and gave his last interview on TV3 to John Campbell the same day.\nLange was first elected to the New Zealand Parliament in a byelection in 1977. As a lawyer, he had built up a personal rapport with his Mangere constituency by representing poor clients free of charge. In less than three years, he was elected Deputy Leader of the Labour Party, and, after an initial failed bid for the leadership in 1980, was chosen to replace Bill Rowling as the party leader in 1983. He went on to lead the party to a landslide victory in the general election held on 14 July, 1984, ousting the longtime Prime Minister, Robert Muldoon. \nDespite his nominal socialism, he initiated sweeping reforms to deregulate the economy and boost private enterprise, and his was regarded as a government of the left only in name. In foreign policy, however, Lange remained somewhat further to the left: he banned nuclear-armed and powered warships from entering New Zealand's ports, straining a once-close relationship with the United States. In 1985 he took part in a widely-televised Oxford Union debate , arguing for the proposition that \"nuclear weapons are morally indefensible\", in opposition to U.S. televangelist Jerry Falwell.\nLange won the 1987 election by an even greater margin than in 1984, but internal divisions within the Labour Party were weakening his position. Many rank and file members of the party felt that the government's economic reforms were a betrayal of Labour's socialist ideology. Attempting to appease the left, Lange fired his right-wing Finance Minister, Roger Douglas, late in 1988. When the party caucus, which under Labour Party rules chooses the cabinet, insisted on his reinstatement to the cabinet in mid-1989, Lange resigned on 8 August, 1989.\nLange was widely regarded as a larger-than-life figure, who was never far from controversy. Once regarded as a fervent Methodist, Lange weathered a storm in 1990 after his decision to leave his first wife, Naomi, and move in with Margaret Pope, whom he later married. In 1996, Lange and Pope had a daughter, Edith; Lange, whose health was already in decline, said that his fondest hope was to see Edith grow up. Responding to questions about whether he was afraid of being \"an old dad,\" he replied, \"No ... but I'm afraid of being a dead dad.\" He said in another interview the same year, on announcing his final retirement from politics, that he hoped to spend more time with his family, to concentrate on lecturing and writing, \"and to grow old.\" This last wish did not materialize.\nLange was remembered for his intelligence, his wit, and his loud booming voice. Supporters and opponents alike spoke warmly of Lange. Whether they agreed with his policies or not, they described him as a deeply compassionate man who would be sadly missed."}

They reacted to the recent deaths of Peter Jennings and Barbara Bel Geddes and the disclosure that Dana Reeve has lung cancer by urging people to have their lungs screened with special helical CT chest scans.\nBecause health insurance plans do not cover such screening, anxious patients who can afford it are paying about $300 for the test out of pocket. The American Cancer Society discourages using the advanced CT scan technique for screening because doctors do not yet know how to interpret findings of small lesions. A helical scan can show lumps as small as 2 millimetres in diameter, but doctors do not know what to make of such lesions. The tumors may not actually be cancerous, and even small cancers may spontaneously remit or may grow so slowly that surgery, radiation or chemotherapy would do far more harm than good. Preliminary results of a large ongoing study, expected within a year, may provide tentative guidelines on when to perform a biopsy and when CT screening would be worthwhile.\nSmoking one pack of cigarettes daily for 20 years or more brings a 50 percent chance of dying from lung cancer. For any smoker, 10 years of abstinence cuts the risk in half. Women are more vulnerable than men even if they don't smoke. Environmental pollutants work with smoking to increase risk. People with affected parents or siblings are 2\u20133 times more likely to fall ill with lung cancer. A malignant tumor can grow silently for years. In the United States by the time it is recognized a lung cancer has spread in 3 out of 4 patients. Routine chest X-ray screening does not improve survival rate. Although patients treated after their lung cancer has shown up in a highly sensitive helical (also called \"spiral\") CT scan are much more likely to survive, this may only be because small cancers grow very slowly or would cause no trouble even without treatment.\nOn the other hand, some cancer experts already strongly support performing the screening. They point out that prompt treatment of lung cancer clearly improves prognosis and that an equivocal scan can be repeated after some months to see if a lesion has enlarged. Furthermore, a decision not to wait for conclusive science but to undergo a helical scan would be supported by consideration of a patient's age, family history, history of smoking and other risk factors. Annual scanning has been recommended for people over age 50 who have smoked 1 pack daily for 30 years or 2 packs for 15 and who also have a known lung condition."}

She says her husband Pat, couldn't bear having Casey's things at home and put most of them in storage. \"We grieved in totally different ways. He wanted to grieve by distracting himself. I wanted to immerse myself.\"\nMrs. Sheehan and her husband were part of a group that met with the President following her son's death last year; a meeting that President Bush began with what she thought was an insultingly insensitive greeting; \"Who we'all gonna honor today.\" Mrs. Sheehan says she had mixed feelings about Bush's demeanor at the meeting, but kept quiet. When more information came out about the planning for the war, however, she started to feel utterly betrayed. \"I want the kind of meeting that holds him accountable for the words he's actually said.\", Sheehan told Time magazine reporters."}

In Japan it is called \"Commemoration Day of the End of the War\". In Korea, one of former colonies of Japan, it has been celebrated as Independence Day, literally the Day when light was retreved. It is commemorated in the USA on 14 August, in most countries, on 15 August. \nAt yesterday Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi laid a wreath at the Chidorigafuchi military ceremony and today expressed \"deep remorse\" and \"heartfelt apology\" for his country's past colonial rule and military aggression at the national commemoration ceremony. He also pledged co-operation with Japan's Asian neighbours to maintain peace and that his country would never go to war again. No such apologies were issued by Western governments for their past colonial rule or military aggressions at this or any other commemorations. There has been an apology made for imprisoning Japanese American citizens during WW2.\nThe Japanese ceremony was held at about noon, the exact time the surrender had been announced. Over 6000 people including the Emperor and Empress, political, industal, union and religious leaders as well as families of dead soldiers attended the ceremony in Budokan, Tokyo with a wreath being laid. In Japan, this day is the Commemoration Day of the End of the War\"; the dead during the war, mainly on the battlefield, are commemorated, not only from World War II, but also the Sino-Japanese War, which lasted for fifteen years from 1930. Flags were lowered to half-mast for their commemoration and at the noon bells, sirens and other means urged the people to pray for them in a minute of silence. \nThe national commemoration ceremony this year in Japan was characterised by the absence of any parents of dead soldiers for the first time since 1946. The number of testimonies of that period has also declined. \nThe Japanese Prime Minister Koizumi decided not to go to the Yasukuni Shrine which commemorates Japan's war dead, including 14 indivuduals judged Class A war criminals by the Allies. Forty-one members of the Japanese Diet did, however, visit the shrine, mostly to honour their own ancestors. Last year, Mr Koizumi's visit to the shrine sparked anti-Japanese riots in China.\nCommemoration events have already taken place across the United Kingdom, including a major event at Blenheim Palace -- home of the late Prime Minister, Sir Winston Churchill. The UK previously marked the 60th VE Day and VJ Day in a combined national day of commemoration on 10 July.\nToday, the Duke of Edinburgh \u2014. Patron of the Burma Star Association and a Royal Navy veteran of the war in the Mediterranean and Pacific \u2014. laid a wreath at the Malta Siege Memorial in central London. He later met with veterans of the Far East conflict at a service in the Imperial War Museum in London.\nProminent guests included Viscount Slim (son of the late Field Marshal Slim, commander of the British Fourteenth Army in Burma), Countess Mountbatten of Burma (daughter of the late Lord Louis Mountbatten, Supreme Allied Commander South East Asia Theatre), and Dame Vera Lynn. \nIn Bangkok, Thanpuying Poonsuk Phanomyong, Pridi's widow, attended the unveling of a new memorial dedicated to the Seri Thai at Thammasat University. An exhibition commemorating the end of the war was presided over by the Foreign Minister, Professor Eiji Murashima and Anand Panyarachun. \nRelated News.\nAmerica's atomic bombing commemoration held in Hiroshima"}

They have blocked the gate of Neve Dekalim, one of the largest settlements in the Strip, and called upon the soldiers to refuse their orders. \"You're a partner to a crime,\" they screamed to army members.\nMaj. Gen.

Defence Minister Shaul Mofaz called it a \"painful and difficult, but historic day\".\nIn a televised prime time address, Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon outlined his reasons for the withdrawal: \"This act is essential for Israel. Believe me, the pain I feel with this act is the full realisation that we must do it. [...] We cannot hold onto Gaza forever, more than a milion Palestinians live there [...] crowded in refugee camps, poverty and hotbeds of hatred with no hope on the horizon.\" Sharon also said that if any terrorist attacks by Palestinians were to occur after the pull-out his government would deliever the \"harshest response ever\". But he also stated that if the Palestians would stretch out their hand in peace \"we will respond with an olive branch.\"\nThe Palestinian Authority fully agrees with the Israeli actions. \"We tell the Israeli people, `You have chosen the right path,'. Don't listen to the voices of the extremists who want a continuation of the occupation. I don't want \u2014 and I will not accept \u2014 any clashes with the army or the settlers,\" Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas told Channel 10 TV. Abbas also insisted that Israel must hand over control over the West Bank and East Jerusalem as well in the not so far future.\nThe PA itself has deployed some 7,500 security to prevent attacks by Palestinian extremists.\nThe Gaza Strip has been partially occupied by Jewish settlers for 38 years. The average per capita Palestinian annual income there in 2001 was $625 U.S. dollars and there are extreme dietary deficiencies among the Palestinian people. Israel has given no assurances that there will be a lessening of trade restrictions on goods coming out of the Gaza strip."}

The researchers are working under a $2.8 million grant from the National Institutes of Health in hopes of developing a test which can determine the likelihood of a ram being female-oriented before it is sold as a stud.\nBy studying difference in the animal's brains after slaughter, the study also showed what could be a biological determiner for what makes a ram male-oriented instead of female-oriented sexually. The scientists' results showed that the anterior preoptic area of the rams' hypothalamus was 50 percent smaller in male-oriented rams as opposed to female oriented rams. A 1991 study of human brains of AIDS victims showed a similar hypothalamus size difference between gay and heterosexual men.\nThe sheep researchers postulate that low levels of aromatase hormones in the brain of a developing male sheep fetus may have kept the brain from fully masculinizing, leading to sexually male-oriented rams.\n\"This lends further support to the idea that homosexuality has biological underpinnings,\" Charles Roselli, a professor of physiology and pharmacology, said in an interview with the \"Corvallis Gazette-Times\".\nProfessor Stormshak believes that \"understanding sexual drives and the continuum of sexual behavior could possibly help explain the scientific basis of sexual assault [and] put an end to assertions that homosexuality is a lifestyle choice.\""}

All 121 on board a Helios Boeing 737 died when it crashed near Athens after flying from Cyprus. A text message, reportedly sent from the doomed aircraft, has also been revealed as a hoax.\nGreek Chief Coroner Philippos Koutsaftis stated \"Until now I have done an autopsy on six bodies and first evidence is that when they were killed they had circulation in their heart and lungs. \n\"That does not mean that they were conscious but that they had breath and circulation. They had circulation and heartbeat so they were alive.\"\nInitial reports from the Greek Defence Ministry had suggested the bodies were \"frozen solid\" at the moment of impact.\nThe coroner stressed that as more post mortems were carried out new evidence may come to light.\nNothing is known about the cause of the disaster beyond the fact that everyone on board the airliner was incapacitated at some point, and that emergency oxygen masks had been used. Speculation abounds, with the theory that the airliner failed to maintain pressurisation at some point being the most popular theory.\nHelios has said the aircraft was maintained in line with European regulations and had also received a standard inspection before take-off.\nGreek police have also arrested a man who claimed his cousin texted him from the airliner, saying the pilots were blue in the face and that they were freezing. He was brought to the district attorney where two charges were filed against him, for lying to the authorities and for spreading false information, and a trial was scheduled. The man claimed that his intention was to gain publicity.\nPolice have also attended Helios's offices to requisition documents as part of the investigation into the disaster.\nIt has also been revealed that Helios is owned by a British company, Libra Holidays Group. Helios are giving the relatives of each victim \u20ac19,000 in initial compensation, as is required by the Montreal Convention and EU regulations. "}

Despite this, infants whose names register with the \"no-fly list\" are being impeded at major airports across the nation.\nThe U.S. government has maintained a list of people who are barred from flying or required to pass additional security checks since before the 9/11 attacks, but the list has grown from a few dozen to more than 100,000 since then. Critics of the list, such as the American Civil Liberties Union, say not enough detail is provided on the list to accurately identify who it is meant to be targeting, resulting in innocents being snagged. The TSA is investigating 89 children who either complained themselves that their name is on the list, or had complaints filed on their behalf. Fourteen of them are babies under two.\nRichard A. Altomare, Chairman of the Coalition for Luggage Security sees the babies debacle as indicative of more serious concerns; \"We see articles daily about luggage and airport security. Each one contradicts what the TSA says it is doing to provide safer air travel for the public. The flying public is distracted by hopping on one foot with their shoes in one hand and their belt in another, or babies being held up because their names are the same as or similar to those of possible terrorists on the government's 'no-fly list.' But meanwhile, uninspected or minimally inspected cargo is loaded into the belly of the same plane. This just means there is no true reform, but rather a facade to give the illusion of real reform.\""}

The reports suggest the police shot Jean Charles de Menezes because they mistakenly identified him as Hussain Osman, and had agreed to shoot him if he ran. Hussain Osman was suspected of having placed a faulty or mock explosive in a train.\nThe original reports claimed that de Menezes was acting suspiciously, was wearing a padded jacket, and ran when challenged, even vaulting the ticket barriers. However, the leaked documents, which include statements from officers involved in the operation and photographs of the scene, show that he behaved like any other commuter, used his travel pass to enter the station, even picking up a newspaper on his way. He was not challenged by police, and appears to have been unaware of being followed until after he entered the train. Photographic stills show he was only wearing a light denim jacket. It appears that he only ran in order to reach a train that was about to leave the platform. \nThe leaked document describes CCTV footage, which shows Mr de Menezes entered Stockwell station at a \"normal walking pace\" and descended slowly on an escalator.\nThe document said: \"At some point near the bottom he is seen to run across the concourse and enter the carriage before sitting in an available seat.\"\nAn eye witness, who was sitting opposite de Menezes on the train, is quoted as saying: \"Within a few seconds I saw a man coming into the double doors to my left. He was pointing a small black handgun towards a person sitting opposite me. He pointed the gun at the right hand side of the man's head. The gun was within 12 inches of the man's head when the first shot was fired.\"\nThis report is considerably different to initial reports that claimed de Menezes tripped as he fled onto the train, before being restrained by pursuing officers and shot. Photographs leaked to ITN appear to corroborate this new witness's report as they clearly show blood on the seat in which de Menezes is said to have been sitting.\nOther statements suggest that the Brazilian was seated before being pinned down by a plain-clothed police officer. Plainclothed armed officers had entered the carriage at this point. Several shots were then fired and de Menezes was hit seven times in the head and once in the shoulder. Three further shots missed Mr Menezes.\nA community officer's report (one of the leaked documents) confirms that Mr. de Menezes was seated and restrained at the time of being shot:\n\"I heard shouting which included the word \u2018police\u2019 and turned to face the male in the denim jacket.\n\"He immediately stood up and advanced towards me and the CO19 [the armed unit] officers \u2026I grabbed the male in the denim jacket by wrapping both my arms around his torso, pinning his arms to his side.\n\"I then pushed him back onto the seat where he had been previously sitting \u2026 I then heard a gun shot very close to my left ear and was dragged away onto the floor of the carriage.\"\nThe leaked documents confirm that Police had been given permission to shoot if a suspect was non-compliant, having been told that \"unusual tactics\" may be required and if they \"were deployed to intercept a subject and there was an opportunity to challenge, but if the subject was non compliant, a critical shot may be taken.\" It is thought that when he ran for the train officers felt this was suitable evidence of \"non-compliance\".\nThe Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) said its priority was to keep Mr de Menezes family informed and refused to comment on the details of the leak.\nThe commission said the family \"will clearly be distressed that they have received information on television concerning his death\".\nIn an interview with the Guardian Newspaper, Asad Rehman, spokesman for the family's campaign, called for a public inquiry. \"This was not an accident,\" he said. \"It was serious neglect. Clearly, there was a failure both in police intelligence and on an operational level.\"\nHarriet Wistrich, the family's solicitor expressed concerns, during an interview with ITN, that the Police had withheld information from the investigation for a longer period than was permitted under UK law. Ms. Wistrich also claimed, in a separate interview with the BBC, that the documents suggest that the original information given to the pathologist who carried out the post-mortem examination on Mr de Menezes was incorrect and that the information the leaked documents contained was \"shocking and terrifying\". \n\"What sort of society are we living in where we can execute suspects?\" she asked in the BBC interview. \nAn unnamed senior police source told the Guardian that the leaked documents and statements give an accurate picture of what was known so far about the shooting. Former Flying Squad commander John O'Connor told the BBC \"had the normal procedures taken place in which a warning is given and officers wear specially marked clothing then this young man may not have been killed.\"\nThe IPCC statement added: \"The IPCC made it clear that we would not speculate or release partial information about the investigation, and that others should not do so. That remains the case.\" \nMark Oaten, Home Affairs Spokesman for the Liberal Democrats, said: \"If true, these preliminary findings will create obvious concerns. It is in the best interests of the police and the community for the full report and any recommendations, to be published as quickly as possible.\""}

Its reporting suggested that it had the potential to become one of the most virulent and costly yet seen. This story was unique among cyber-attacks reports as the network apparently learned of the virus through becoming one of its early victims. Media organizations ABC and the New York Times were affected as well. Perhaps first-hand experience gave the studio more insight on the virus while providing an early notice. The coverage that followed, however, raises concerns that the network's perspective was skewed, and that perhaps the damage even diminished its reporting ability.\nCNN treated the story as a potential global crisis in its manner of coverage as well as in the advice given to viewers. For over 45 minutes, by one viewer's tally, CNN devoted exclusive air-time to this topic. Home users were advised to turn off their computers for safety, while businesses were warned that if continued operations prevented this measure, they were at high risk. CNN.com sported a bold red headline above its usual content area, warning of the virus. CNN stated they were requesting reports from key sources across the nation, including California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger.\nAfter some time, the network eventually obtained a Microsoft statement describing the virus as \"low-impact\" and only affecting computers running Windows 2000. CNN also learned from Microsoft that there was a patch available at Microsoft's web site. CNN's coverage contrasted with a lack of actual evidence of widespread infections, in this reporter's view. Much of the discussion and advice came from experts probably not officially associated with CNN, so there is a question of who is at fault.\nChris Carboni of the Internet Storm Center speculated that \"The fact that CNN, ABC and the NYTimes got it may be as simple as reporters from these organizations visiting the same event and connecting to an infected network. While a firewall may have protected their office network up to now, these infected laptops were able to take out the network from the inside once they connected back to it.\"\nSources.\nCNN Television news; August 16, 2005"}

The first song he learned was \"There's an Old Spinning Wheel in the Parlor\". He described his talent saying, \"It was God's gift, something born in me. I was too dumb to learn it any other way. I listened to the (Grand Ole) Opry some. I'd pick it up one note at a time. I was young, with plenty of time and I didn't give up. You'd come home from school, do your lessons and that's it. No other distractions. I don't read music. I play what I hear.\" \nHe didn't always earn his living playing music, though. In the mid-1960s he was employed briefly at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, where he worked on plumbing. He also performed several other blue-collar jobs including work in a Georgia paper mill, as switchman for Atlantic Coast Railroad; he even sold insurance and once owned a potato chip franchise. \nIn his 50 year career he played with artists ranging from Woody Herman, and the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band to The Grateful Dead, Linda Ronstadt and Paul McCartney, and earned at least five Grammy nominations and numerous professional accolades. He once recorded with the pop group the Monkees by happenstance, when he stayed behind after an earlier recording session. He also appeared in Robert Altman's 1975 film \"Nashville\". \nHis 2005 Grammy award for best country instrumental performance was for \"Earl's Breakdown,\" by the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band, and featured Mr. Clements, Earl Scruggs, Randy Scruggs and Jerry Douglas.\nMr. Clements, whose last performance was February 4 in Jamestown, N.Y., was hospitalized earlier this year for 18 days to receive chemotherapy and other treatment. He had been diagnosed in March 2005. \nBorn in Kinard, South Carolina, his musical career began at age 14 when he associated with Bill Monroe, and later officially joined the Blue Grass Boys band where he remained for seven years. In 1957 he joined bluegrass band Jim &amp; Jesse McReynolds where he remained until 1962. In 1967 he returned to Nashville where he became a much sought after studio musician. \nAfter a brief touring stint with Faron Young he joined John Hartford's Dobrolic Plectral Society in 1971 when he met guitarist Norman Blake and Dobro player Tut Taylor, and recorded \"Aereo Plain\", a widely acclaimed newgrass album that helped broaden the bluegrass market and sound. After less than a year he joined Earl Scruggs, who first earned widespread renown for playing the theme to sitcom \"The Beverly Hillbillies\". \nHis 1972 work with the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band on their album \"Will the Circle Be Unbroken\" earned him even wider acclaim, and later worked with the Grateful Dead's \"Wake of the Flood\" and Jimmy Buffett's \"A White Sport Coat and a Pink Crustacean\".\nThough he played numerous instruments, Mr. Clements indicated that he chose the fiddle over guitar recalling that, \"I picked up a guitar and fiddle and tried them both out. The guitar was pretty easy, but I couldn't get nothing out of the fiddle. So every time I'd see those instruments sitting side by side, I'd grab that fiddle.\"\nBig band and swing music were considerable influences upon his style and musical development, and he said that, \u201cBands like Glenn Miller, Les Brown, Tommy Dorsey, Harry James and Artie Shaw were very popular when I was a kid.

I don't think it's a war we need to be in.\"\nSheehan continued to tell the reporters, \"He offered it because he heard about the shots fired at us the other day and he didn't think that was right. He happens to be the third cousin of the person that fired the shots and so he came down and he said he supports us 100 percent.\"\nThe \"shots fired\" were those of nearby resident Larry Mattlage, whose land borders the protesters at their current location. After complaining about the proximity of the protesters, he fired a shotgun twice into the air Sunday - in order to prepare for duck hunting season, he said. Mattlage says at no time was he ever threatening the protesters with his shots.\nNot all Americans agree with Mrs. Sheehan's position. On Monday, a man was arrested and charged with vandalism of Camp Casey's memorial for troops lost in Iraq. Around 10pm the previous night, authorities say the accused used his pickup truck to run over hundreds of small wooden crosses bearing names of U.S. soldiers killed in Iraq.\nIn comments to the press, Bush offered sympathy to Sheehan, \"I sympathize with Mrs. Sheehan. She feels strongly about her -- about her position. And she has every right in the world to say what she believes.\", he said. However, he has still declined to meet her. \"I think it's important for me to be thoughtful and sensitive to those who have got something to say.\" Bush told reporters, \"But, I think it's also important for me to go on with my life, to keep a balanced life.\"\nOthers have commented that Sheehan is being used by those with their own agendas, \"What started out as a grieving mom that we all sympathized with has now turned into ... an orchestrated far-left campaign,\" commented Greg Mueller, a conservative public-relations executive.\nA former FBI special agent, Rowley, and Becky Lourey, whose son was killed in Iraq, will leave for Texas on Thursday and camp at the site for a few days.\nRowley said, \"It puts a human face on this issue; many people, if they don't have a personal connection to the troops, it's so easy for this to become a discussion that lacks seriousness and urgency. I think it's good to show that there are real people that are being affected.\"\n\"Our children are dying and I think it's time to go support Cindy and see if Bush will come out and we can say, 'President Bush, what is the mission exactly?',\" Becky Lourey added. \"Truth has been shifting all around and I think we need to rejoin the world community and not occupy another nation.\" Lourey said.\nSheehan wants the withdrawal of all troops from Iraq.

Ervin &amp; Associates.\nAccording to Ervin, the average price for a litre (.26 gallon) of regular unleaded gasoline is now C$1.04 (US$0.87, \u20ac0.71)\nFuel remains under a dollar a litre in some parts of the country, with retailers in Edmonton offering the cheapest prices of all the major cities at 93.3 cents/litre. Drivers in Montreal were paying $1.14/litre, the highest price in the country.\nThe surging price of crude oil has been cited by Ervin as the reason for the unprecedented prices. Rising demand coupled by ongoing political problems in the Middle East have pushed crude prices to new records at the close of each day of trading. The price at the New York Mercantile Exchange is now averaging over US$65 per barrel, a full $20 a barrel higher than one year ago.\n\"The biggest factor playing into the current pump price is, without a doubt, the high crude oil prices,\" according to Ervin's Cathy Hay. But she added, \"Layering in on top of that is very strong gasoline demand and a decline in inventories.\"\nHay's remarks echo the view of many analysts that despite the record prices, there is not yet any sign of major changes in Canadians' driving habits. \n\"(Canadians) will basically grin and bear it. Well, maybe they won't grin, but they'll bear it.\" Bank of Montreal economist Doug Porter said. \"So far we really haven't seen any response whatsoever on the consumer spending front.\"\nThe rising fuel prices have prompted the country's major airlines, Air Canada and WestJet to levy fuel surcharges. Analysts expect the rising fuel costs to trigger a rise in the price of many goods and services as shipping costs rise. Concerns regarding the long-term effect of higher fuel prices are prompting demands by the Canadian Taxpayers Federation, the Canadian Automobile Association and others that the federal and provincial governments either lower or eliminate gasoline taxes.\nNova Scotian Finance Minister Peter Christie is considering such requests, although he emphasized that such steps would not be taken quickly. Nova Scotian New Democrat leader Darrell Dexter said the province's Harmonized Sales Tax should be removed from gasoline, asserting that since there are already both federal and provincial excise taxes on fuel, it is therefore immoral to charge what is effectively a double tax by adding HST (or the Goods and Services Tax and provincial sales taxes outside Atlantic Canada).\nHowever, federal cabinet ministers were quick to reject calls to lower the federal excise tax to exempt GST. Federal Natural Resources Minister John Efford said the price of gasoline was being driven up by demand for crude oil, not taxes."}

Among them were 17 injured, four requiring hospitalization - one for a leg injury, and three for heat-related illness, said Henrico County Police. Reports of trampling in the stampede were not uncommon, and one driver reportedly tried to drive through the throng of prospective buyers. \nAlice Jemerson, an elderly customer said, \"They bum rushed the gates and I was knocked over, fighting for my life. All these people were on top of me.\"\nShortly after 7am EST officials opened the gates and many residents ran hysterically toward the building where the sale was to occur at 9am. \nAt a post sale press conference, Henrico County Police spokesman Lieutenant Doug Perry told reporters, \"A few bad apples found their way inside. It looked worse than it was.\"\nApple iBooks are the preferred computer for Henrico County schools, and Director of General Services of Henrico County Paul Proto, said changes were made to the event after tremendous interest was generated, some as far away as Europe and California. Officials closed and moved the sale from the Henrico county school warehouse to the RIR, after residents complained that their tax dollars were used to buy the computers, and they ought to have first right to repurchase them. The Henrico County Board of Supervisors voted to amend the County Code so that only residents could purchase the laptop computers. \nAlthough officials had prohibited camping out and overnight parking, some in attendance reported that people began arriving at midnight. \nHenrico Police Chief H.W. Stanley, Jr. said five patrol officers were originally planned for the event, a customary presence for an event the size authorities had estimated. But by 6 am, an enormous crowd was assembled at the front gate. \nOfficials present before opening told the crowd that automobiles would be allowed to enter first, which prompted many to run to their cars. But while some were running back to their cars, others rushed the gate. The resulting confusion created much anger, and guards closed the gates shortly thereafter. \nLong lines encircling the sale building were commonplace, and one observer noted, \"They're going to see themselves on the news tonight, and see what fools they are.\"\nSome citizens, however, considered their wait worthwhile. Hairstylist and mother of two Sheress Blunt was one of the first hundred to buy one of the iBooks; she came with her mother and said they sneaked into the raceway through a side gate. \nTonya Vaughan arrived at 5:30 a.m., also bought one of the first iBooks and said three people offered to buy it from her for as much as $200. She declined however, saying, \"I told them no way! I had worked too hard for it.\"\nLt. Perry said many officers were complimented on the way they handled the crowd, adding that police were seen letting children who had been pushed aside, into the building. \nMr. Proto said, \"There are no plans right now to have another iBook sale.\" \nHenrico County Battalion Police Chief Steve Wood said no arrests were made and the iBooks were sold out by 1pm EST."}

However, as there were only 10 people in the experimental group (and another 10 in the control group), this is not a statistically significant sample. \nIf this surgical procedure is as successful in large-scale studies, it may lead the way for the use of robotic surgery in even more delicate procedures, such as heart surgery. Note that this is not a fully automated system, as a human doctor controls the operation via remote control. Laparoscopic gastric bypass surgery is a treatment for obesity.\nThere were concerns that doctors, in the future, might only be trained in the remote control procedure. Ronald G. Latimer, M.D., of Santa Barbara, CA, warned \"The fact that surgeons may have to open the patient or might actually need to revert to standard laparoscopic techniques demands that this basic training be a requirement before a robot is purchased. Robots do malfunction, so a backup system is imperative. We should not be seduced to buy this instrument to train surgeons if they are not able to do the primary operations themselves.\" \nThere are precedents for just such a problem occurring. A previous \"new technology\", the electrocardiogram (ECG), has lead to a lack of basic education on the older technology, the stethoscope. As a result, many heart conditions now go undiagnosed, especially in children and others who rarely undergo an ECG procedure."}

Prosecuters say Tobin conspired with state GOP official Charles Mcgee and consultant Allen Raymond in Virginia, both of whom are cooperating with prosecutors, to have the consultant's telephone firm make repeated hang-up calls to Democratic and labor union get-out-the-vote phone banks, effectively jamming their phone lines. The New Hampshire Republican State Committee paid $15,600 to the firm. Callers requesting transportation to polling places were thus unable to receive any, allege prosecutors.\nRepublican John Sunonu won a close US Senate race in New Hampshire following the phone-jammings which occurred in November 2002.\nThe RNC has been paying Tobin's legal fees, which have so far amounted to $722,382. The RNC did not specify that the payments were for Tobin's defense in reports with the FEC, but has since confirmed that they were. RNC Chairperson Ken Mehlman said in a May 18, 2005 statement that he \"strongly support[ed]\" a \"zero-tolerance policy\" on election fraud. Some have therefore criticized the GOP for making the payments to the powerful Williams and Connolly law firm. But on August 10, 2005, RNC spokesperson Tracey Schmitt said their support of Tobin through payment of his legal fees is \"based on his assurance and our belief that Jim has not engaged in any wrongdoing.\"\nTobin's involvement is said to have been finding the firm to make the calls. Raymond told prosecutors Tobin explained the scheme to him and asked him to implement it, and his lawyers said that he had believed Tobin was acting under RNC sanction in his then capacity as policial director for New England. Tobin went on to work for the president's re-election campaign.\nPaul Tworney, a volunteer lawyer for New Hampshire Democrats said the RNC's actions suggested more people may be involved. \"It originally appeared to us that there were just certain rogue elements of the Republican Party who were willing to do anything to win control of the U.S. Senate, including depriving Americans of their ability to vote. But now that the RNC actually is bankrolling Mr. Tobin's defense, coupled with the fact that it has refused some discovery in the civil case, really raises the questions of who are they protecting, how high does this go and who was in on this,\" said Twoney.\nThe New Hampshire Democratic Party Chairperson Kathy Sullivan demanded that the state Republican Chairperson Warren Henderson resign."}

The latest data from Chandra and the Hubble Space Telescope indicate that this much-anticipated event has begun.\" an article on the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics' Chandra website states.\nThese events confirm scientists' understanding of stars. As the shock wave continues it will travel through less understood material, hopefully allowing scientists to further their research into the birth and death of stars, and the overall behaviour of the universe."}

This contrasts to averages of $2.55 (67.4\u00a2/L) in the United States and $6.24 ($1.65/L) in Great Britain. Even neighboring Iran pays more at the pump than Iraq; 38 cents a gallon (10.0\u00a2/L).\nThe low cost is due in large part to generous pre-war government subsidies on petroleum products that remain in place today.\nIn its report, the IMF warned the subsidies are a threat to economic growth in the country. The country still suffers near daily insurgent attacks, high unemployement, inflation, and frequent electrical, water, and sewage service disruptions.\nMeanwhile, Iraqi oil output continues to recover. Prior to Operation Iraqi Freedom, Iraq's daily output of crude was 2.5 million barrels a day. This week, oil production is 1.6 million barrels per day.

It also was occupied earlier before back in the 1940s, settled by a couple Jewish families who were able to hold off the Eygptian army.\nAround 1,500 protesters inside the synagogue refused to leave despite warnings from the soldiers. Many protesters have been retaliating to the soldiers' commands, and have even started shoving and punching a few guards. The protesters have linked their arms in a chain to attempt to prevent themselves being removed. The protesters are mostly not Gaza settlers, but are extremist youths from the West Bank and Israel. \nAfter several hours of unsuccessful negotiations unarmed security forces entered the complex to begin removing people to buses waiting outside. Those who did not go as instructed were usually escorted by two or three guards each to the buses. Meanwhile, all male protesters have been removed from the building while the female protesters are still inside the synagogue.\nIn another Gaza town, Kfar Darom, protesters are also making their last stand in a synagogue, and thousands of troops have surrounded the buildings. There, soldiers entered the synagogue as well and are dragging protesters out of the building. They were, however, hampered by protesters on the roof, who, among other things, threw caustic soda at the soldiers. Consequently, the rooftop was taken by security forces as well. Seventy seven people have been injured, two moderately on the roof of the synagogue. Police say that 120 demonstrators were arrested.\nThe evacuations are extremely stressful for protesters and soldiers alike. Having to evict fellow Jews is \"traumatic\" for the soldiers said IDF Capt. Yael Harman. He added in connections to the synagogues evacuations: \"Many of our soldiers are religious, and it's very difficult for them to conceive of the idea of going into a religious building and trying to pull those people out [...] but this is what we must do.\" "}

The full system is the premium edition; it comes with the components and accessories \u2014 including a detachable 20-gigabyte hard drive and wireless controller \u2014 that Microsoft believes necessary for experiencing 'the ultimate digital entertainment thrill ride'. It will retail at $399.99 in the US, \u20ac399.99 in Europe and \u00a3279.99 in the UK. The Core System is essentially a stripped-down version, offering the full power of the Xbox 360 without the add-on features.

The stand-alone Xbox 360 contains $375 worth of hardware. With the console set to retail at $299.99 (or $399.99 with $100 worth of add-ons) Microsoft stands to make a $76 loss on each unit sold. It is expected that 933,000 to 1.2 million units will be sold in 2005, which means that the Xbox 360 could cost its publisher up to $91.2 million for this year alone. Microsoft plans to make up the lost income with sales of its eagerly awaited launch titles. "}

They, as well as Motassedeq who wanted acquittal, are going to appeal before Germany's Supreme Court.\nBack in 2003, Motassadeq was sentenced to 15 years in jail for accessory to murder but that ruling was overturned by the Supreme Court, making this retrial necessary."}

The country's state-owned energy monopoly, PLN, has not determined the immediate cause, and the country's president has ordered the national intelligence agency and police to investigate.\nThe blackout appears related to deficiencies in Indonesia's power generation capacity.\nThe power failure follows attempts to deal with the country's growing energy crisis, including conservation and trying to allow private companies to provide energy, which was ruled unconstitutional in 2004. In January, the Indonesian government held a special energy summit to attract investment in their energy infrastructure. At the summit they set the goal of adding 22,000 megawatts to Indonesia's present capacity of 23,000 megawatts, in order to support the country's growth.\nThe World Bank and others have warned that without more investment in the country's energy infrastructure an energy deficit will result. However, foreign investors remain wary of investing in Indonesia. \"The power outage has resulted in worries over an energy crisis which could hurt the nation's industrial sector,\" said a trader on Indonesia's stock market.\nThe outage began at 10:23 a.m. local time, August 18, 2005, when power failed along the electrical system that connects Java, Bali, and Madura, causing outages in Java and Bali. Almost half of the country depends on the electrical grid that experienced failures. Some of the main lines on the grid are over 20 years old, according to PLN president Eddie Widiono.\nThe blackout caused traffic jams in Jakarta, forced cancellation of several international and domestic flights at Jakarta's Soekarno-Hatta International Airport, shut down Jakarta's electric train service, and disrupted hospital operations. Some larger hospitals were forced to delay surgeries while many smaller hospitals could not receive patients. About 1,800 officers were called into action by Jakarta's metropolitan police to deal with short-term problems caused by the power failure.\nCandles used in place of electric lighting started six fires in Jakarta alone.\nMulyo Aji, a PLN official, said more power failures are likely in the future as energy demand increases, without any corresponding new supplies of electricity scheduled to come online soon."}

In a press release from the Sheriff's Office in Utah County, the department states that previous allegations of sexual abuse at other raves, as well as various firearm and theft violations, were reasons for the investigation. The release continues on to state that the proper permit was not obtained before the event started.\nThe promoters deny this allegation and insist that all permits were legally obtained before the event.\nArmed with semi-automatic assault rifles, tasers, and tear gas, the police used dogs to sweep the crowd for narcotics. At least one helicopter was used in the operation, which served as a large spotlight for the ground teams. Prior to raiding the show, several unnamed police informants had reportedly told police that they had observed some \"illegal activities\". \nThe promoter says the party took place on private property, named Child's Ranch, with express permission from the owner. The property owner has apparently had at least one previous lawsuit with police over a similar event. Utah County requires a permit, bond and county commission approval for all gatherings with more than 250 people present and which can be expected to continue for 12 hours or more. DJ time slots and Pro Audio and Lighting contracts show that the party was scheduled to go on for no more than ten hours. According to a DJ at the event, \"They presold 700 tickets and they expected up to 3,000 people total.\" He added that by the time police arrived \"the crowd was about 1,500\". \nThe police have publicly stated that only a permit from the health department was obtained, and that a Utah mass gathering permit was needed. The promoters have stated that they had the required permit, and have given a permit number (# 2005-11). Jay Stone, who handles mass gathering permits for the Utah County Health Department\u2019s Bureau of Environmental Health Services, has confirmed that the permit was applied for and granted for the party. Officials also claim that the party had spilled over onto public land, and that more than 60 arrests were made in total - for driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs, underage drinking, drug possession and distribution, resisting arrest, assault on a police officer, disorderly conduct, and one instance of a weapons offense, a pistol which was found in the home of the private property owners. Among the confiscated items and drugs found were cocaine, ecstasy, marijuana, mushrooms, alcohol, and drug paraphernalia. Some of the drugs may include those confiscated from attendees by private security guards - who were also arrested. \nAmateur video from the scene shows a number of SWAT police (Sheriff's press release places the figure at 90) screaming orders at the DJs to \"Shut it down \"now\"!\" and yelling at others to \"get out now, or I'll kick your ass in jail.\" Armed police are also seen tackling two attendees, Alaisha Matagi and Paul Maka. It is unclear from the video footage whether these actions were provoked or not. However, those shown on the two-minute long footage that are being forced to the ground do not appear to be resisting arrest. Both Matagi and Maka are charged with failure to obey a police officer and resisting arrest - Maka is also charged with interfering with police. Sheriff Jim Tracy stated in an email that both of them were tackled and arrested after assaulting a deputy, however, neither of them are being charged with assaulting a police officer.\nA first hand account from a DJ booked to play at the party stated that while police were arresting a man accused of possession, the suspect was beaten to the ground and continually \"kicked in the ribs\" by four armed \"soldiers\" dressed in camouflage. The item was not shown on the video footage. According to the account, nobody resisted the policemen, and the crowd was orderly, but tear gas was thrown at the partiers as they attempted to leave as instructed. The DJ also states that police were attempting to confiscate video equipment, but an amateur video has still surfaced on the internet (see sources below). The video appears to have been taken near the DJ stand before it was moved to show more of the action.\nSeveral attendees felt they should have the right to attend an event where drugs may be present, so long as they don't personally use them. \"While it may be true that some individuals choose to take drugs at said events like this, myself as well as many others choose to go for the music. Just like anything, you have bad apples, but you shouldn't cut down the tree,\" said one attendee. \"Raves are not the only musical gatherings where drugs are used and distributed,\" said another.\nOther event-goers felt that the use of force in the shutdown was excessive - numerous eyewitness accounts by concertgoers describe people being beaten, tasered, or attacked with dogs. An email from Sheriff Jim Tracy stated that dogs and tasers were present at the raid, however, he also states that the tasers were not used on anyone, and that no dogs were deployed against concertgoers.\nOne account from an attendee, identified as \"Colby\", states: \n\"I saw at least two people being beaten on the ground while barking, snarling dogs are held just a few feet from them. Weapons were being pointed at unarmed, peaceful civilians. A friend of mine was forced at gunpoint to put his hands on his head and turn around, because he asked if he could get his things from the tent.\"\nUtah County sheriff's Sergeant Darren Gilbert also alleged that a 17-year-old girl was found overdosed on ecstasy, and was treated and released to her parents. According to an advertisement for the event, an attorney was present at the party. The local sheriff is scheduled to appear on Utah TV."}

A total of 8,500 people have been evacuated, and many existing houses have been bulldozed.\nNetzarim is one of the oldest settlements in the coastal strip, and has frequently been the target of Palestinian militant attacks. The village has been targeted particularly often as it divides the strip, and is also the most isolated Israeli settlement in Gaza.\n600 residents are expected to leave peacefully after negotiating with police. They will depart in a fleet of armored buses and head to the Western Wall in Jerusalem, the holiest shrine in Judaism. Settlers will receive the equivalent of hundreds of thousands of US dollars in compensation.\nThree young people were arrested on Sunday after police found them apparently preparing to resist violently, armed with metal spikes and barbed wire. Residents were still working on their buildings until large numbers of troops entered the settlement and began going house-to-house. Although there were tearful scenes, there were none of the protests of earlier in the week.\nOne resident said the evacuation showed the Arabs that the Jews were \"weak and would run away\", and others have said it rewards the Palestinian uprising that began in 2000. However, overall, most Israelis support the withdrawals, with many blaming radical Judaism, including such settlements, for inciting conflict with Palestinians. Others merely consider isolated settlements an unnecessary defense burden on the Israeli military.\nFour small militant West Bank settlements will also be cleared, with 5,500 troops heading there to begin the clearances on Tuesday. The Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon announced at the same time that existing large West Bank settlements will be expanded. More than 230,000 Israelis live there, while 3.8 million Palestinians live in the Gaza strip and West Bank.\nSharon has said that he hopes the pull-out from the Gaza strip will help in negotiations for the retention of large West Bank blocs, even though the US opposes continued construction there. Israel feels that it has a much stronger Biblical claim to the West Bank than it did to the Gaza strip and the Palestinians feel they have the stronger claim to the land. Further small, isolated West Bank settlements may be cleared in the future.\nIt is said that 2,000 Israeli right-wing extremists are preparing to resist the evacuation in two of the four small West Bank settlements that are to be cleared. Hundreds of extremist youths have headed to the settlements from other nearby towns.\nSettlers slashed the tires of Army vehicles over the weekend and set fire to an Army tractor with the driver inside. The Israeli Public Security Minister has said there will be no tolerance for those who oppose the troops. Most weapons have already been collected.\nThe US-backed \"peace road map\" calls on the Palestinians to disarm, which may result in more of the West Bank being cleared. However, the road map also calls on Israel to halt its expansion in the West Bank.\nPalestinian President Mahmoud Abbas hopes the Israeli pull-outs will signal to Muslim militants that peaceful negotiations can work."}

We desperately wanted our brothers and sisters to be with us, I know they wanted to be here too.\"\nMost of the denials were for economic reasons, if someone doesn't have a high enough income or a fixed job it can be assumed that they will stay in the country for work. Representatives from the gathering now plan to go to Kenya in October to share some of the programme with those who were unable to come. \nDespite the missing Friends, the gathering has brought together a mix of different Quaker traditions in a positive atmosphere that has been appreciated by participants. Many Quakers worship in silence (unprogrammed meetings) while others, particularly in America and Africa, have ministers like other churches. Quakers also have differences of opinion over theological issues, including even the existence of God, but the young Friends have not found this to be an obstacle to coming together. Unlike many traditional Christian sects, the Religious Society of Friends, or Quakers, encourage each member to explore his or her own relationship with God.\nChrissy Muhr of Northwest Yearly Meeting (Northwest US) wrote: \"I've been really impressed by how the mix of worship styles has been handled. Almost all the programmed Friends I've spoken to have some prior experience of unprogrammed worship.

The director of the official French anti-doping test laboratory at Ch\u00e2tenay-Malabry, Jacques de Ceaurriz was quoted as saying he had \"no doubt about the validity of our results.\" He said that while being kept for long periods can cause EPO proteins to deteriorate, this would possibly result in negative tests for doped athletes, but not false positives. \nIt should be pointed out that technically this statement is false. EPO is naturally produced in the body. It is present at low levels in normal human urine, and natural levels in a human doing high-altitude training (a known \"trick\" of Mr. Armstrong) could be unusually high. Therefore, false positives can be obtained by setting the sensitivity threshold too low. This is especially true if the number of control samples (for calibration purposes) is limited, as is the case with the 1999 urine samples. These calibration issues are a reason EPO wasn't officially tested for earlier. Incidentally, de Ceaurriz stated that his laboratory worked on numbered anonymous samples, and was unaware when he sent his results to WADA/AMA that some of the results concerned Lance Armstrong.\nIn addition to these accusations, and in response to them, Armstrong has also received open backing from US Cycling , individual cycling officials , from former Tour winners Eddy Merckx and Miguel Indurain , and other public figures.\nSupporters argue numerous irregularities in the doping claim: \"' \"Wada (World Anti-Doping Agency) and the US Anti-Doping Agency, they've all defined a process for collecting samples, managing samples, testing the samples, identifying the people who are involved\",' said Johnson. ' \"They have certain rights in the process. None of that has been followed in this case\".' Officials from cycling's ruling body (UCI), Wada, the French sports ministry and the Tour de France all agree normal anti-doping proceedings have not been followed. ' \"This isn't a 'doping positive. This is just a publication in a French tabloid newspaper. That's our perspective\",'\" added Johnson.'\"--BBC \nThese allegations are still under examination by a number of news and anti-doping organizations. \nOn September 9, after a period of investigation, the UCI finally released a strongly-worded official statement condemning the WADA, the French laboratory in question, and the paper L'Equipe, for having failed to provide any official communication, and having failed to provide any data, evidence, or background on the allegations. The UCI stated that it was still \"awaiting plausible answers\" to its requests to WADA and the laboratory, but also indicated \"We deplore the fact that the long-established and entrenched confidentiality principle could be violated in such a flagrant way without any respect for fair play and the rider's privacy.\" \nThe accusers themselves, in particular the World Anti-Doping Agency, might face an investigation into their own practices, in connection to their allegations against Armstrong. The UCI stated \"We have substantial concerns about the impact of this matter on the integrity of the overall drug testing regime of the Olympic movement, and in particular the questions it raises over the trustworthiness of some of the sports and political authorities active in the anti-doping fight.\" \nOn October 5, the UCI announced the appointment of an independent expert to investigate the leaking of doping allegations against Armstrong: \"French sports newspaper L'Equipe claims that samples given by the American icon on the 1999 Tour later tested positive. Armstrong has denied the allegations. The International Cycling Union (UCI) has now appointed Dutch lawyer and doping specialist Emile Vrijman to probe how the details were released. The UCI said it 'expects all relevant parties to fully co-operate'. Vrijman is a former director of the National Anti-Doping Agency in the Netherlands (NeCeDo).\" "}

Ninety-eight percent of all Venezuelans are Roman Catholic or Protestant.\nRelating to the latest allegations from Ch\u00e1vez that the U.S. is planning to assassinate him, which the U.S. government denies, Robertson said: \"You know, I don't know about this doctrine of assassination, but if he thinks we're trying to assassinate him, I think that we really ought to go ahead and do it.\"\nHe added that he did not believe Venezuela would stop exporting oil if that were to happen as Ch\u00e1vez suggested. He again called Ch\u00e1vez a \"terrific danger\" to the U.S. with the potential to hurt the country \"very bad[ly]\" and concluded: \"We have the ability to take him out, and I think the time has come that we exercise that ability. We don't need another $200 billion war to get rid of one, you know, strong-arm dictator. It's a whole lot easier to have some of the covert operatives do the job and then get it over with.\"\nA spokeswoman for Robertson, Angell Watts, said to the Associated Press that he would not give interviews on Tuesday and had no statement elaborating on his remarks. However, he later issued an apology.\nIn response, Venezuela's Vice President Jos\u00e9 Vicente Rangel accused Robertson of making terrorist threats: \"It's the height of hypocrisy for the U.S. to continue talking about the war against terrorism when at the same time you have someone making obvious terrorist declarations in the heart of the country.\"\nThe U.S. State Department called the remarks \"inappropriate\" and insisted that they do not reflect official policy and that the U.S. is not now, nor ever was, planning to take \"hostile actions\" against Venezuela. \nRev. Barry Lynn, executive director of Americans United for Separation of Church and State, reacted to Robertson's remarks: \"It's absolutely chilling to hear a religious leader call for the murder of any political leader, no matter how much he disagrees with such a leader's policies or practices.\"\nIn an effort to distance themselves from Robertson's statements, many evangelical Christians have publicly condemned his speech. \"This kind of statement, by this well known American Christian leader, is in complete contradiction to the teachings of Jesus Christ who evangelical Christians believe and seek to demonstrate,\" said Geoff Tunnicliffe, International Director of the World Evangelical Alliance. \"Robertson does not speak for evangelical Christians. We believe in justice and the protection of human rights of all people, including the life of President Chavez.\"\nRobertson is considered to have staunch conservative views. His unsuccessful bid for the Republican nomination for president in 1988 led to allegations of partisanship. According to White House press secretary Scott McClellan, Robertson met with President George W. Bush in November 2002 to discuss the Invasion of Iraq. He considers himself to be a supporter of Bush. Today he remains a controversial public figure.\nHugo Ch\u00e1vez has led oil-rich Venezuela into an anti-US, pro-Cuba policy, and called for seizing assets of wealthy families in an attempt to convert his nation from capitalism to socialism. He has also worked against regional trade pacts led by the US. These actions have alarmed some in the US, such as Robertson, as well as many in his own country. His policies are against the interests of powerful families in Venezuela, so he may be a target of local assassins.\nA similar call from a religious leader for assassination came from the now deceased Ayatollah Khomeini of Iran in 1989 against British ex-Muslim writer Salman Rushdie over the content of his book, \"The Satanic Verses\". Iran also offered a multi-million dollar reward to anyone who carries out the killing.\nRelated news.\nUS televangelist Pat Robertson apologizes for assassination remark, August 25, 2005"}

The Hoosier politician also is touting his appeal to traditionally republican voters.\nPopular red state politician.\nAmong the selling points Bayh points to in his likely 2008 bid is that he is a democrat who consistently wins elections in republican red states by appealing to moderate republican and libertarian-leaning voters.\nA former leader and key figure in the Democratic Leadership Council moderate movement in the Democratic party that brought Bill Clinton to the national stage, Bayh is known as a Democrat who won with landslide margins of victory during both terms as Indiana's governor and two U.S. Senate runs in the traditionally Republican-voting state. \nIn an interview with the \"Terre Haute, Indiana Tribune Star\" newspaper, he noted Democratic former president Harry Truman as a role model. In recent news reports he also criticized the national Democratic Party image as being weak on national defense. \nCritics point out this popularity with moderate republicans could be a liability for Bayh in the Democrat Primaries, which are traditionally controlled by left-leaning party activists, also referred to as \"Progressives.\"\nOrganized money raiser.\nBetween January and July 31, 2005, three years before the election, Bayh has raised $1.17 million for a potential 2008 bid--more than most potential 2008 presidential nominees. He out raised fellow democrats Hillary Clinton, John Kerry and John Edwards. Each, unlike Bayh, are well-known household names in the United States. Money-raising results by political action committees are reported to and released by the U.S. Federal Election Commission.\nClinton is widely considered the front runner, and Democratic money leader. She has focused her attention on reelection in 2006 to her New York U.S. Senate seat. For that campaign, she has raised $10 million. \nBayh is being beaten in the money-raising arena by Democratic party chairman Howard Dean, who raised $1.77 million in the first six months of the year. Dean has made a name for himself as an effective money-raiser for liberal causes. But Dean has bowed out of the 2008 race according to reports.\nBayh is trailing the top Republican 2008 presidential; hopeful, Sen. Bill Frist, considered a top Republican candidate for 2008, who collected $1.9 million in the first six months of 2005."}

The remains of the 87-year-old, who died in 1997, were removed under the cover of darkness from the churchyard they were buried in, and have not been found.\nTwo men were arrested in connection with the grave robbery, but were later released without charge.\nThe family hopes that their announcement that the farm will close will lead to the return of their mother's remains.\nA close relative of Mrs Hammond, who spoke anonymously to the BBC, said, \"Gladys was a relative of the Halls by marriage only and had no involvement in guinea pig breeding. She was a kind, gentle country lady who loved animals.\"\nLegal peaceful protesters were overjoyed at the news. Johnny Holmes, a spokesman for Stop the Newchurch Guinea Pigs, said: \"This is the most fantastic day of my life.\" The group, which has picketted the farm for several years, says it will remain until all the guinea pigs have gone.\nThe group's website describes the experiments the guinea pigs were subjected to as being \"horrendous\", and have accused the farm of keeping tens of thousands of animals in poor conditions leading to many dying of malnutrition and neurosis. Video footage taken by the group inside the farm show many young animals dying and under extreme stress.\nThey also say the animals have been used for cosmetics research and for \"unscientific\" medical experiments.\nThe Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry (ABPI), in an online statement, gave their best wishes to the Hammond family, and described the decision as \"regrettable but understandable\".\nTheir director of Science and Technology said, \"Guinea pigs have provided essential information to support biomedical research into respiratory disease resulting in real breakthroughs in the development of new medicines.\"\nThe animals from the farm have been used in biomedical research, especially for respiratory diseases such as asthma.

The residents of the two other towns went peacefully.\nIn the synagogues of the settlements Israeli troops had to cut through barricades of iron bars and barbed wire before carrying out protesters, but they did not resist.

His automobile was found in a campground of Dixie National Forest with a note that he would be back in a few hours. An extensive search and rescue operation was conducted to try to locate this hiker by the Washington County Sheriff's Office in Utah.\nInvestigators in the Sheriff's Office were able to track him down to Cairns, Queensland. Apparently before he was \"missing\", he bought a one-way ticket to Australia. Bryan Butas, the missing hiker, apparently had been under a great deal of stress and \"got sick of it all\", according to a telephone interview by the Associated Press.\nButas has been charged with insurance fraud, a second-degree felony, by Washington County Attorney Brock Belnap. This was because Butas plotted to obtain a $250,000 life insurance policy before faking his own disappearance. He has also been given a bill for $20,000 by the Washington County Sheriff's Office for their search and rescue operations on his behalf.\nHis wife and children have since his disappearance moved to the wife's parent's home in Ohio. Butas's parents came to Southern Utah to help in the search and were \"embarrassed and shocked\" to learn their son had merely run away from marital and financial difficulties, Washington County Sheriff Kirk Smith said.\nWashington County Sheriff Sgt. Jake Adams said his investigation included tracing an application Butas made for a passport, his purchase of a one-way airline ticket to Australia, and the life insurance policy that names his wife and children as beneficiaries. On August 18, Adams said Butas's mother called him to say her son had called home the evening of August 11, several days after the search was officially called off for the missing man. Butas asked his mother for money and an airline ticket home, which she sent.\nButas has since been checked into the Veteran's Administration Hospital in Brecksville, Ohio, according to Adams, but will shortly return to Utah."}

Konchesky will also be available for the Hammers' next game on Saturday when West Ham host Bolton Wanderers. However, the FA's actions contravene FIFA regulations, which demand that any player sent off be suspended for his team's next match, with no right of appeal except for mistaken identity.\nFIFA House had already been in contact with Soho Square over the past week after the FA downgraded a red card that had been given to Newcastle United's Jermaine Jenas to a yellow card on the advice of referee Steve Bennett. The FA had indicated it would eventually issue a reply to FIFA, but the decision to overturn two more cards less than a week after the FIFA communication is likely to displease FIFA president Sepp Blatter.\nFor the past three years especially, Blatter has been adamant that a red card in a football match must result in the player who was sent off missing his team's next game in the same competition. Blatter has clashed with the FA on this issue during that time, going so far as to threaten the English association with expulsion from FIFA. As a result, the FA agreed in 2004 to change their disciplinary process, in particular ensuring the process was expedited so that a player who was sent off did indeed miss his next match. However, it is now apparent that the FA has chosen to also allow for expedited appeals of red cards on grounds other than mistaken identity, which is not provided for in the FIFA regulations.\nAlthough the FA has now permitted Jenas, Welsh and Konchesky to play after being sent off in a previous match, it also extended an automatic three-match ban imposed on Southend United's Freddy Eastwood by one additional match after its disciplinary panel deemed his appeal of a red card received the previous weekend to be \"frivolous.\" The FA also rejected the appeal of Luton Town's Steve Howard, but did not extend his three-match suspension.\nUnlike with Jenas, the red cards issued to Welsh and Konchesky will remain on their disciplinary records because the referees involved did not agree that they made mistakes. This means they will still receive an additional one-match ban should they be sent off again this season. Following Tuesday's decisions, half of the six red cards shown in the Premiership this season have been overturned. And in an interesting footnote, it was Jenas who Konchesky was sent off for fouling this past weekend."}

In doing so, \"Plusnet\" allegedly did not inform its existing customers by e-mail, and instead published new products and prices on their public portal. This manner of notice for the price changes may have resulted in thousands of customers paying almost twice as much for the same service.\nWithin the last month, \"Plusnet\" began Packet Shaping peer-to-peer transfers for users of its 'Premier' service, which is sold and described as a 'clean' connection. \nThey also recently introduced the throttling [enforcing a maximum limit] of customers using more than 150GB per month of bandwidth. Users whose bandwidth is throttled receive service of 70Kbps, while paying for 2Mbps. This figure is based on the PlusNet network contention of 30:1, being 2mb divided by thirty users. The throttle is in place until the end of the customers current billing period, and is meant to help keep broadband access for all \"Plusnet\" users fast by stopping a small percentage of users from using excessive bandwidth. As a result, the ISP has begun receiving numbers of customer complaints and criticism both privately and through their publicly accessible member discussion forums. Though the vast majority of comments on this new Sustainable Usage Policy have been positive.\nWade Woverly, 20, from Leeds (also known as \"Wadev1589\"), started a thread in the \"Plusnet\" member discussion forums challenging the ISP on a number of customer service issues. One of those was regarding the customers who were paying an unnecessary premium for the same internet connection. In addition, Woverly mentioned he was assisting the Trading Standards Institute with an investigation of the legality of terms and conditions of \"Plusnet\". \nThe accusations by Woverly, that customers are being over-charged, are considered speculative. Woverly asked the same questions dozens of times on forum pages, hoping to receive some sort of answer from \"Plusnet\" that he considered satisfactory. Ultimately, he claims the ISP called him on the telephone and said that if he didn't stop posting comments on their forums, they would terminate his ADSL internet connection and forum access. Woverly said \"Plusnet's\" position was that he was using up excessive customer services resources.\nAfter a night of lengthy posts both on \"Plusnet\" boards and at the forums at \"ADSLGuide\", a Customer Services Manager at \"Plusnet\", Carol Axe, allegedly contacted Woverly to inform him that they would be terminating his service, and that he has 30 days to migrate away until his line will be disconnected. Axe refused to allow her conversation to be recorded: \"her voice was that of rude arrogance, not listening at all, it was a true ultimatum of a call,\" according to Woverly. \nNeil Armstrong, the Head of Marketing at \"Plusnet\", commented, \"Our comms team is there to serve all our customers, not to be drained by one unreasonably demanding customer.\"\nThe \"Plusnet\" forums are led by a team of moderators, also customers, whose job it is to deal with problem posters, amongst other things. Forum Moderator Liam Martin, another stirrer, said \"Part of our moderation involves restricting access to those users causing problems... and this is always carried out at our discretion when we believe somebody is causing a nuisance and/or breaking forum rules. 'Wadev1589' didn't come close to being banned, in my book. This has come as a complete shock.\"\nA second user, \"pr100\" from Wargrave, has since then had his service ended after being given the same ultimatum. He was told that it was \"in his best interests\". He responded on the \"Plusnet\" forum, \"I did suggest to her that perhaps PlusNet should allow me to decide what will be in my best interest whereupon she stopped beating around the bush and said that my account was being terminated because of my anti-PlusNet posts in the forum.\" Not all ISP's would give you the option of migrating or losing your BB connection, some would just use their right to end your contract forthwith.\nAnother forum user, \"chuffbears\", commented, \"Carol [Axe] is in a position where she should be taking responsibility for customer service. In my book she should be issuing an apology over this entire situation.\"\nDiscussion board.\nPlusnet Board Thread (Use guest login)"}

Visual Arts Brampton offered kids the chance to create artwork for their Snail Mail World Postcard Art Show, while the Brampton Arts Council gave away pink sand buckets with Region of Peel water bottles. Young visitors were noticeably enthralled by Sassy the Squirrel, the City's mascot.\nPeople who bought passes to the Brampton Day event through the City were encouraged to wear blue wrist bands around the park, for a chance to get spotted and win a prize. A draw was held for prizes including green fees for four at the Peel Village Golf Course, Heritage Theatre tickets, and restaurant gift certificates.\nFestival Square's proximity to Lake Ontario caused its share of trouble, particularly for the arts groups displaying in the south. Tents were blown on their sides, becoming veritable wind sails. Luckily no guests or volunteers were injured by the mishaps. One painting infused with a sculpture, at the Beaux-Arts Brampton tent, was destroyed early in the day after catching a gust of wind.\nAverage windspeed for the Toronto Island Airport area is 12 km/h."}

The protest, which starts on August 30, is expected to attract up to 2,000 protesters. Similar events in the past often had instances of violent confrontations between police and some of the activists. The 30A network is a loose affiliation of groups and individuals co-ordinating the protest. \n30A spokesman Bruce Knobloch, of the International Socialist Organisation, made the call for a peaceful protest in a press release last week.\n\"We want a safe community action showing that people in Sydney oppose Howard\u00b9s plan for a US-style wages system, the war in Iraq and his kow-towing to global corporate chiefs. We pose no threat to the Opera House or the millionaire delegates, or to other users of east Circular Quay,\" Mr Knobloch said.\nThe conference will be held at the Sydney Opera House. The Forbes website says that at the event \"senior figures from the world's leading companies and institutions will discuss the best ways to nurture and capitalize on innovation and reveal the latest global trends.\" It was recently announced that George Bush Sr will be attending the conference, along with former New York mayor Rudolph Giuliani, Prime Minister John Howard, and former NSW Premier Bob Carr. \nMr Knobloch described the attendees as \"a few hundred neo-conservative corporate chiefs\".\nThe protesters have been denied access to the Opera House forecourt for the duration of the conference. Mr Knobloch believes that this decision is unjustified. He also accused the police of deliberately creating the conditions for confrontation.\n\"The police seem intent on creating chaos and confrontation, which is the last thing we need. We've urged police to build a barrier in front of the Opera House proper and to allow us to use the public space in the forecourt. By pushing us out into the CBD the police are going to create problems for commuters and business owners,\" he said.\n30A protestors this week organised a media conference outside Surry Hills Police Station, requesting a meeting to negotiate an agreement. According to an article on Sydney Indymedia, police at the station were unable to discuss the issue, but told 30a representatives that they would be contacted to organise a meeting. \n\"Minimising the protesters right to peacefully rally dramatically increases police powers and strikes at the heart of protesters' democratic right to peaceful assembly,\" the article said. \nASIO has assessed the conference to be \"medium risk\", and this has been used by the police and government to justify the increased security."}

And while Angela Merkel's Christian Democrats (CDU) got the most votes it performed much worse than projected and the SPD is only three seats behind thanks to several overhang seats. But that could change slightly, when the outstanding by-election in Dresden is over. So who will govern the country for the next four years is completely uncertain. Both Schr\u00f6der and Merkel reaffirmed their ambitions for the office of chancellor. But neither the CDU and the Free Democrats (FDP) nor SPD and the Greens have a majority of seats in the Bundestag. A grand coalition between the CDU and the SPD now seems to be the likely option for a future government. But also a SPD-Greens-FDP or a CDU-Greens-FDP coalition seems possible. However FDP chair Guido Westerwelle said this party would not be available for a coalition with the SPD. The Left also doesn't want to form a coalition with any of the parties in Bundestag. They, along with the Free Democrats, are the only real winners of this election. After The Left only had 2 MPs in the last Bundestag, they are now stronger than ever before, getting 54 seats. The Free Democrats also scored one of their best results in their history, gaining 3% and getting 61 seats, which makes them the third biggest party in the Bundestag.\nFDP.\n&lt;br clear=all&gt;\nThe Left.\n&lt;br clear=all&gt;\nBackground.\nAbout 61,9 million citizens were eligible to participate in this early election to the 16th German Bundestag. It became necessary because chancellor Schr\u00f6der deliberately lost a motion of confidence on July 1st. 3648 candidates are competing for the 598 seats (more in case of overhang seats) in the Bundestag. The voters in the constituency of Dresden I are not participating in today's election, the death of a candidate there forced a delayed by-election for the 2nd of October.&lt;br&gt;The all dominating topics of the election campaign were unemployment and the state of the German economy. Other hot issues include a taxation reform and changes to the health insurance system. The race was wide open till the end. Contrary to tradition, all parties concluded their campaigns on Saturday rather than Friday.\nCoalitions.\nAll parties say the possible coalitions exclude the Left, who might support the minority government of SPD-Greens. The Grand coalition (CDU/SPD) is possible only with Schroeder in power according to Schroeder, and only with Merkel in power according to Merkel.\nThe traffic light coalition (SPD-Green-FDP) is excluded by FDP. CDU is likely to try to lure the Greens into coalition, the only option that was not excluded. Also possible are the minority governments. It is still not clear who will be the new leader, and both CDU and SPD claim the right to appoint new chancellor. Although the leftists won, it is possible that conservatives will form government if Greens are willing.\nPreliminary Results.\nParticipation: 77.7% "}

Etymological explanations are also given for the articles in the encyclopedic dictionary that is a product of work with both original resources and rather rich bibliographies. \n\"Encyclopedic Dictionary of Blacksea\", a source for many answers on the Black Sea region of Anatolia, looks like a work of a great labor. The dictionary is being published by Heyamola Publications and printed only in limited numbers. It can be a scientific resource for those who are interested in the history, culture and folklore of Black Sea. \nThe author of the encyclopedia evaluates his work of 1260 pages:\n\"I don\u2019t know why no archeological excavations have been made in the Pontic coast of Anatolia. Querying why no excavations have been made in such a region that has a dense settlement as mentioned in Anabasis of Xenophon (B.C 401) is not the subject of this book. However, undoubtedly it will not be an optimistic experience to see that less excavations have been made here than in Crimea and Colchis. Another interesting and discuss-worthy issue is why a realistic analysis of the original names of villages and quarters, used by the people even after the changes of the names in Republic era, is not been made in works on the region\u2019s culture and history, including studies in Turkish. Limiting myself to cities as Ordu, Giresun, Trabzon, Rize and Artvin, I worked on original words, idioms and toponyms used by Turkish dialect speakers, independent from their native language. I made comparisons with vernaculars from surrounding cities including Samsun, Erzurum and G\u00fcm\u00fc\u015fhane, Anatolia, and from some surrounding countries. I hope that the comparison of the original toponyms with equivalents from Anatolia, Greece/Hellas, Armenia, Georgia, Azerbaijan and other Turkish states could be useful for those interested in regional history, and influential for researchers.\"\nWhile some village names in regions do match with the villages names in Crete and Epirus, no equivalents are found in Anatolia and Northern Hellas. Some village names akin to those in Northern Abkhazia, the motherland of Laz, show remnants of Pelasgi and Thracians, the population of Anatolia and Hellas, prior to the Indo-Europeans. This requires a re-examination not only of Anatolian and regional history, but also of the history of a wider area, ranging from the Caucasus to the Balkans.\nSources.\nAuthor: \u00d6zhan \u00d6zt\u00fcrk \nPublisher: Heyamola Publishing House\nPublication Date: 9/6/2005"}

Swedish is the fifth language to reach this milestone, joining English, French, German, and Japanese.\nThe article growth was quite modest when 100 articles remained, but at 18:09, with less than 50 articles left, people started submitting a lot of articles. Most of them were written in advance, according to visitors at the IRC channel. The 100,000th article is believed to be about a minister of the Faroe Islands, \"J\u00f3gvan vi\u00f0 Keldu\", according to announcement pages on the site minutes after the milestone was passed. Some concerns were raised, however, and a Wikipedian claimed on the village pump that the article \"Epiglottal klusil\" (\"linguistic subject\") was number 100,000.\nThe Swedish edition is said to have been started in May 2001, but didn't see much growth until November 2002 when several contributors arrived. The 50,000 mark was passed less than a year ago.\nThe Swedish Wikipedia operates using the same basic principles as its larger English language sister edition, which include writing from a Neutral Point of View and making content open using the GNU Free Documentation License.\nThe size is quite large compared to the number of speakers of Swedish worldwide (about 9 million). The Swedish edition is larger than some languages with hundreds of millions of speakers such as Spanish, Portuguese, Chinese and Hindi. The reason for this is somewhat obscure, but discussions on the central discussion forum of the site, Bybrunnen (a literal translation of \"village pump\"), say this is because articles are considerably shorter than on other Wikipedias and that the Internet connectivity is very high in Sweden. Other Wikipedias for languages spoken in Northern Europe (including Norwegian, Danish and Finnish) also have a high number of articles compared to the number of speakers."}

Dr. Ayotte said on Tuesday (Aug. 23) that three ethically critical, and important, scientific questions were raised by a four-page doping allegation in the French cycling daily \"L'\u00c9quipe\". \"L'\u00c9quipe\" released lab data with a medical identification allegedly finding banned EPO in five year old samples of cyclist Lance Armstrong's urine, originally taken after he won the 1999 Tour de France. \nAyotte expressed surprise that chemical testing of 1999 urine could have been done in 2004 at the French national anti-doping laboratory at Ch\u00e2tenay-Malabry. She said that she routinely instructs all doping laboratory organizations that EPO deteriorates and disappears after two or three months, even if the urine is frozen. Ayotte does not question whether the new type of analysis is correct; rather she questions the ethics of long-delayed test results. \nThe first ethical problem , in her opinion, is that an adverse finding cannot be confirmed with second samples, as required by WADA regulations. She states that there are normally two samples, \"A\" and \"B\". The Ch\u00e2tenay-Malabry EPO findings were based on Armstrong's \"B\" samples. Armstrong's \"A\" samples were depleted in 1999 for tests that did not include EPO, because no EPO test was available that year. \nFrench Sports Minister Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Lamour said that without the \"A\" samples, no disciplinary action could be taken against Armstrong. \nThe second ethical problem, in Ayotte's view, is that an athlete charged with doping long after the athletic event has no way to submit to additional testing to disprove an adverse finding. \nThe third ethical problem for Ayotte is that \"L'\u00c9quipe\" disclosed Armstrong's medical identity. \"It seems to me,\" Ayotte continued, \"that this whole thing is breach of the WADA code.

{"id": "19695", "revid": "4460", "url": "https://en.wikinews.org/wiki?curid=19695", "title": "UK study claims men have higher average I.Q. than women", "text": "In a study accepted for publication by the \"British Journal of Psychology\", Dr. Paul Irwing (Manchester Business School, Senior Lecturer in Organizational Psychology) and Prof. Richard Lynn (University of Ulster, Professor Emeritus) conclude that men are on average five points ahead on IQ tests. The study also found that men outnumbered women in increasing numbers as intelligence levels rise. There were twice as many with IQ scores of 125, a level typical for people with first-class degrees. When scores rose to 155, a level associated with genius, there were 5.5 men for every woman.\nProfessor Lynn has a number of previous articles arguing that there are differences in intelligence between racial groups. In a 2003 study, he found a correlation between average IQ and prosperity in 60 countries. In a letter to \"The Psychologist\", Professor Lynn claimed \u201cMen have larger brains than women by about 10% and larger brains confer greater brain power, so men must necessarily be on average more intelligent than women.\u201d Most psychologists view brain size as less significant than numerous other gender differences. One reason brain size may not be significant is that the majority of the brain is not involved in \"providing intelligence\" but rather performs mundane tasks; such as regulating pulse and breathing, processing inputs from the five senses, and providing redundancy in case of brain damage. Larger brains may contain more space devoted to such functions, and the same or even less space devoted to intelligence. Colloquially, elephants and whales have brains many times the size of the human brain, yet do not appear to be more intelligent.\nEarlier this year, the president of Harvard University, Lawrence Summers, sparked a controversy when he suggested that \"intrinsic aptitude\" was responsible for the low numbers of women at the top in many fields, especially in science and engineering. In response to Summers comment, Stephen Pinker and Elizabeth Spelke held a debate on the conclusions which can be drawn from the extensive existing scientific research on gender differences. Spelke held that discrimination remained the primary factor keeping women from going into physics, mathematics, and computer science; while Pinker suggested that life choices were more important today. This debate is considered an exceptionally good introduction to the subject for lay-persons. \nSeveral subtle points popularized by the Pinker vs. Spelke debate are relevant to the Irwing &amp; Lynn study. First, females benefit significantly from single sex education, but single sex education has little impact upon males. As a consequence, the Irwing &amp; Lynn study can not lay claim to a biological difference in intelligence, unless it restricts itself to women attending all girls schools. Secondly, the process of natural selection leads males of any species to have more variance in most traits. As a result, Stephen Pinker suggests that one should find \"more geniuses and more idiots\" among human males (see Pinker slide 41). As a consequence, any omission of people at the lower end of the IQ spectrum would bias the average male IQ upward, relative to the average female IQ . \nNeither Pinker nor Spelke suggests brain size is particularly important. However, both agree that men and women have different mental strengths and even handle various mental tasks differently. Both see these differences as an asset to the scientific community.\nIQ tests have been criticized for testing how similar a person's thought processes are to the author of the tests, primarily men, rather than how intelligent they are. In particular, some tests have been biased towards thought processes where males are dominant, such as 3D spatial rotation and visualization. Tests devised by females would be more likely to emphasize female strengths, such as computation and communication. Many modern IQ tests attempt to control for gender differences by including more questions targeted at female strengths. However, such efforts are hampered by the lack of a clear definition of intelligence."}

Bisceglia is chief executive of USA Cycling, principal authority over Armstrong for cycling sports in the United States.\n\"L'\u00c9quipe\" released Paris lab data allegedly finding banned EPO in five year old samples of Armstrong's urine, originally taken after he won the 1999 Tour de France. No official source would confirm medical identification of Armstrong as provider of the anonymously tested urine, and to do so would be a violation of World Anti-doping Agency (WADA) regulations. \nArmstrong suggested motivation for such manipulation is a French national hatred of all non-French sport winners, and specifically because a French rider has not won the Tour de France for a quarter century. As evidence of malice toward him, Armstrong cited a French newspaper poll in which he was named the third most hated sportsman in France. \nDr. Ayotte is Doping Control director at Canada's Institut National de la Recherch\u00e9 Scientifique in Montreal, which is a WADA certified lab nearest to WADA's Montreal headquarters. Ayotte is also a world class scientific authority and instructor on sports doping detection. Dr. Ayotte's expert opinion has significant influence on the outcome of WADA regulatory decisions. \n\"L'\u00c9quipe\" reported that the EPO detection method used was experimental, which raises a scientific question. All experimentally based forensic evidence is subject to the close scrutiny of scientific opinions before it can be used in a disciplinary or legal proceeding. \nAyotte expressed surprise that chemical testing of 1999 urine could have been done in 2004 at the French national anti-doping laboratory at Ch\u00e2tenay-Malabry. She said that she routinely instructs all doping laboratory organizations, that previously detectable EPO protein deteriorates and disappears after two or three months, even if the urine is frozen. \nAyotte thinks that a new statistical mathematics model was used to reanalyze numerical data resulting from earlier chemical testing. \"My interpretation is that retesting itself must have been conducted in 2000 or in 2001, but the results were reviewed using the new mathematical model that is now being developed in Paris.\"\nAyotte does not question whether the new type of analysis is correct; rather she questions the ethics of long-delayed test results. \nThe first ethical problem is that this adverse finding cannot be confirmed with second samples. There are normally available two urine samples, \"A\" and \"B\". The Ch\u00e2tenay-Malabry EPO findings were based on Armstrong's \"B\" samples. Armstrong's \"A\" samples were depleted in 1999 for tests that did not include EPO, because no EPO test was available that year. \nWithout addressing the ethics problem, Dick Pound, the head of WADA, said. \"You can count on the fingers of one hand the times a \"B\" sample has not confirmed the result of the \"A\" sample\".\nBoth France and USA officials observed that \"L'\u00c9quipe's\" unofficial adverse finding was not consistent with WADA regulations. French Sports Minister Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Lamour said that without the \"A\" samples, no disciplinary action could be taken against Armstrong. USA official Bisceglia confirmed that WADA regulations require a confirming \"A\" test to prove guilt.\nThe second ethical problem, according to Ayotte, is that an athlete charged with doping long after the athletic event, has no way to submit to additional testing to disprove an adverse finding. This same ethical problem was also stated by USA official Bisceglia. \nThe third ethical problem for Ayotte is that \"L'\u00c9quipe\" disclosed Armstrong's medical identity. \"It seems to me,\" Ayotte continued, \"that this whole thing is breach of the WADA code. We are supposed to work confidentially until such time that we can confirm a result. By no means does this mean that we sweep a result under the carpet, but it has to meet a certain set of requirements.\" \nIn a further ethical complication, the medical identification of Armstrong is completely unofficial and is made only by \"L'\u00c9quipe\". Ayotte characterized the disclosure as \"leaked\". \nCh\u00e2tenay-Malabry's lab refused to confirm \"L'\u00c9quipe's\" claim that the urine samples belonged to Armstrong. Nor is it likely that Ch\u00e2tenay-Malabry will ever identify Armstrong, because WADA regulations require that all single \"B\" samples used for experimental testing must remain permanently anonymous. Ayotte said, \"I'm worried, because I have a great deal of respect for my colleagues in Paris. I am concerned that they did not cover their backs before being dragged into a very public issue of this kind.\" \nLance Armstrong has responded on his LanceArmstrong.com website, branding \"L'\u00c9quipe's\" reporting as being \"nothing short of tabloid journalism.\" Armstrong says: \"I will simply restate what I have said many times: I have never taken performance enhancing drugs.\"\nFurther confusing public understanding of the EPO doping claim is Armstrong's statement in his autobiography, \"It's Not About the Bike\": he said he received EPO during his cancer chemotherapy treatment. \"It was the only thing that kept me alive,\" he wrote. \nArmstrong last received chemotherapy EPO in late 1996. Apparently speaking from his knowledge of conventional EPO testing, Armstrong agrees that traces of 1996 synthetic EPO should not have been present in his 1999 urine. There are now tests to distinguish natural from synthetic EPO. But it remains an unresearched scientific question whether the sensitivity of the experimental new method could detect use of synthetic EPO from three years previously. By scientific analogy, the polymerase chain reaction process can detect as little as a single molecule of DNA. \nJean-Marie Leblanc, the director of the Tour de France, said that Armstrong owes cycling fans an explanation. Armstrong subsequently provided an explanation claiming urine test manipulation.\nLeblanc also said; \"For the first time\u2014and these are no longer rumors, or insinuations, these are proven scientific facts\u2014someone has shown me that in 1999, Armstrong had a banned substance called EPO in his body.\" \n\"When people start using comments like, 'irrefutable scientific evidence,' that's a pretty strong statement to make,\" said Bisceglia, \"when the person you're making it about has never been given the opportunity to refute the statement. You're making claims about something that took place in 1999. Based on what I've read, it's pretty clear that any opportunity to have a black-and-white resolution to this case has been destroyed.\"\nBisceglia said that USA Cycling, the governing body in the United States, lacks the officially required evidence, and therefore will not investigate the \"L'\u00c9quipe\" report.

The mayor has stated that rising waters from the Category 5 storm are likely to overtake the city's system of levees, which are designed to prevent flooding in the city. Later predictions by NOAA downgraded the hurricane to a strong Category 4 at the time of landfall.\nMaximum sustained winds are reported at 175 mph (78 m/s). Of great concern to New Orleans officials is the predicted coastal storm surge of 18 to 22 feet above normal tide levels. Destruction from flooding is expected since the city is situated below sea level. \nTraffic within the city is completely gridlocked. The governor has advised citizens heading west to take Highway 90 instead of I-10, which is gridlocked. If they cannot evacuate heading north, they should head eastward first, where traffic is lighter.\nThe mayor has also opened the Superdome as a shelter for those with special medical needs or are otherwise unable to evacuate.

In an FCC mandate, VoIP providers such as Time Warner Cable, Vonage and Verizon, were to send notice to customers asking them acknowledge the possible limitations of E911 access and to keep a record of their replies.\nSpecifically, the FCC mandated that VoIP providers must advise subscribers of the circumstances under which E911 service may not be available, and distribute stickers or other appropriate labels with a warning that E911 service may be limited or not available, and instruct the subscriber to place them on or near the equipment used in conjunction with the service. Lastly, the provider is to obtain and keep a record of affirmative acknowledgement by every subscriber, both new and existing.\nA significant number of VoIP customers did not reply to the warning letter. This led the Voice on the Net Coalition, with House Representative Bart Gordon (D-TN) and Senator Bill Nelson (D-FL) and other lawmakers to write FCC Chairman Kevin Martin with their concerns. For some customers, it was feared that if the VoIP service was ended, they would have no phone service.\nThe E911 system allows emergency operators to link a caller's physical location with the phone used to dial for help. Conventional phones have had that capability for years, but not all VoIP providers have the technology for such a system in place. Cell phone companies are also struggling to upgrade their products for E911 capability.\nVoIP use reported by the TeleGeography Research Group showed strong customer growth during the second quarter of this year. Subscribers increased nearly 40 percent over the first quarter, from roughly 1.9 million to 2.7 million.\nUsers of VoIP seem far from scared off by concerns over E911 connectivity despite findings that indicate the majority are interested in it as a primary phone line replacement. \"To get [VoIP telephony], you\u2019ve got to have a broadband connection, that means you\u2019re a reasonably affluent consumer, you\u2019ve got a cell phone, you\u2019ve got some sort of backup plan in place,\" said Stephan Beckert, an analyst for TeleGeography. \"There was a group that said they would not get it because of the problems with E911. But there was a surprisingly large core group that really didn\u2019t worry about it.\" "}

The network sent out a press release purporting to be from the organisers of the Annual Forbes Conference, claiming that former US President George H. W. Bush was to attend the conference. Bruce Knobloch of the 30A network indicated that the purpose of the hoax was to show how shallow the media coverage of the conference and the protest is.\nThe hoax was originally reported by AAP, who checked the claim with a telephone number provided on the press release before publishing it.

As the two individuals left the scene in the stolen car, the resident followed in his own vehicle until the passenger stepped out of the Honda and opened fire with a shotgun. The police came upon the suspects near West 72nd Avenue &amp; Pierce Street, , Colorado, and began pursuit.\nThe chase proceeded southbound on Sheridan Boulevard and northeast on , reaching speeds of 120 miles per hour (190 kilometres per hour). When the vehicle attempted to merge onto southeast-bound in , Colorado the suspects lost control and impacted two other vehicles.\nThe stolen vehicle may have punctured one or more tires, as sparks were observed from the bottom of the car as it began the merge. The stolen car struck the middle of the passenger's side of a Toyota 4Runner in the left-hand lane and sent it careening across the median into the northwest-bound lanes of traffic, where it rolled several times. The stolen vehicle then bounced off the guardrail on the right shoulder and impacted a Ford pickup truck before coming to rest. The two suspects then escaped on foot, discarding some of their clothing as they fled. One of the passengers traveling in the Toyota 4Runner, Brian Kapko, 19, of Costa Mesa, California, was killed. \nAfter eight hours of searching for the perpetrators, the police called off their manhunt. Later in the day, a witness alerted the police about two \"suspicious persons\" near the scene of the accident. The police arrested a Matthew G. Wartena, 19, and a 16 year old male. Wartena was wearing only boxer shorts, socks and a bloody tank top. The juvenile wore only one sock and tan pants. The pair were charged with suspicion of first-degree murder, attempted first-degree murder, vehicular eluding, and criminal trespass. At the time of the incident Wartena was free on bond, having pleaded guilty the month before to forgery of a government document.\nExternal media.\nMap of accident scene "}

The years 1970 to 1994 saw far fewer hurricanes than 1995 to the present. \"The New York Times\" suggests this decrease was a result of generally cooler North Atlantic water driving winds that disrupted potential hurricanes from forming. Some experts say the recent intensification is part of a natural cycle, while others claim that global warming has increased both the destructive power and the frequency of hurricanes. The \"Times\" also pointed out that during 8 recent years the U.S. has been hit by about one-third fewer severe hurricanes than usual.\nBritain's chief scientific adviser Sir David King stated, \"We have known since 1987 the intensity of hurricanes is related to surface sea temperature and we know that, over the last 15 to 20 years, surface sea temperatures in these regions have increased by half a degree centigrade. So it is easy to conclude that the increased intensity of hurricanes is associated with global warming.\" \nMassachusetts Institute of Technology's Professor Kerry Emanuel wrote that rising sea temperatures could account for only part what he claims has been a sharp rise in the destructiveness of tropical cyclones since the 1970s. Eminent hurricane expert, Professor William Gray said that Emanuel's was \u201ca terrible paper, one of the worst I've ever looked at.\u201d \nJ\u00fcrgen Trittin, Germany's Minister of the Environment was sharply critical of the U.S. Government.

To date, Nigeria has resisted repeated claims by Sierra Leone, the United States, and the United Nations to extradite Mr. Taylor saying that they will only do so if called upon by a freely elected Liberian government. Liberia has its first national elections since Taylor's regime scheduled for October.\nThe Bill has significant implications in Liberia, where Taylor was President until ousted by the international community in August 2003, under an asylum deal with Nigeria. The United Nations has maintained a peacekeeping mission in the country ever since. In October, Liberia faces its first national elections since Taylor, and his influence, although against the terms of his asylum, is seen as potentially destabilizing.\nThe front runners in Liberia's presidential race recently spoke on the Taylor issue at a series of presidential debates held on local radio.

Nancy Kissel was handed a unanimous life sentence verdict for murdering her banker husband in this infamous \"Milkshake Trial\", as it came to be known. \nShe sat expressionless and clothed in black throughout the trial, in which prosecutors painted a picture of her as a cold, calculating killer, who murdered her husband because of his desire to divorce her and take custody of their children after learning that she was having an affair with a repairman. His body was found two days after the murder in a rented storage locker, which the prosecution claimed was evidence of her trying to cover up the murder. \nAn autopsy found six types of sedatives in his body, which were powerful enough to knock him out, and a search of her computer brought up her Internet searches with keywords such as \"drug overdose\".\nProsecution lawyer Paul Chapman stated that \"These were five fatal blows with murderous intent ...

Of course, care should be taken to not ingest any of the flood water. People with open wounds wading or swimming through the water may also be at risk of disease.\nExperts at Louisiana State University said that sediments in the Mississippi River and Lake Ponchartrain are not heavily polluted and that the biggest risk of chemical contamination will come when the flood waters recede, leaving shallow pools where the water can evaporate, concentrating heavier chemical pollutants.\nThe widespread damage caused by the flooding is actually one of the factors in reducing the contamination, since the large amounts of water have diluted many of the contaminants. Most of the chemical pollutants that were released were of low quantity, including gasoline from underground storage tanks, dry cleaning solvents, and household and small-scale industrial chemicals, such as cleaning agents."}

This helps spread the disease, according to the UN.\n\"We are about to enter the harvest season where people will be moving around,\" said Herve Ludovic de Lys, the head of OCHA's West Africa office. \"The main goal is to halt the transmission of this disease,\" he said. \"It's not business as usual. This crisis needs a rapid response.\"\nThe following West African nations have all been hit by cholera epidemics: Burkina Faso, Cote d'Ivoire, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, Mauritania, Mali, Niger, and Senegal. The WHO issued a statement on Thursday that more countries were at risk. \"Outbreaks are likely to spread to Central Africa - Nigeria, Cameroon and Chad - in the next weeks,\" it said."}

Three Democrats abstained.\nThe bill's chief sponsor, Assemblyman Mark Leno (D-San Francisco) said, \"We're looking for three votes, and I can't tell you today who the three will be, but I think the power of the success coming from the floor of the Senate today will give us the necessary momentum and encouragement to do what we all know is the right thing to do.\"\nCalifornia Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger's spokeswoman, Margita Thompson, stated that the Governor believes the issue should be decided by the court and not the legislature.\n\"The governor was elected to uphold the laws of California. The people spoke when they voted in Proposition 22. It has subsequently gone to the courts and the governor believes that is where it should be decided. It's an issue for the people and the courts,\" she said.

He was identified by his daughter from a photo taken Monday by a New Orleans Times-Picayune photographer. However, while it is known that Domino was rescued, his whereabouts and the whereabouts of his family are not immediately clear.\nThe singer had told his agent, Al Embry, that he planned to stay at his home with his wife and daughter, rather than evacuate. He had not been heard from since before the storm hit. Domino, 77, lives in the city's 9th Ward, one of the areas hardest hit by Katrina. Attempts to reach Domino by phone proved futile, as phone lines have not been working in the area since the storm hit.\nAntoine 'Fats' Domino first gained stardom with one of the first rock n' roll records, \"The Fat Man\". The record went platinum, selling over a million copies and hitting #2 on the Billboard charts. Of Domino's numerous Top 40 singles, perhaps his most notable were Blue Monday and a cover of Blueberry Hill.\nDomino retired from touring in the 1980s, and has not left the city since, citing his dislike of touring, and his love of New Orleans cuisine. Not even his induction to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame or an invitation to the White House were able to get Domino to leave the town.\nSee also.\nFats Domino missing in the wake of Hurricane Katrina"}

The state rejected that option hours later. Blanco had declared a state of emergency on August 26. Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff has pointed out \"our constitutional system really places the primary authority in each state with the governor.\" \nThe city's police chief warned that storm victims were being raped and beaten on the streets. Even in the Superdome stadium and the city convention center, where tens of thousands had awaited evacuation, fights had broken out, rubbish burned, and dead bodies have been left uncollected. The Superdome evacuation was completed Saturday night. The Superdome had been opened as a refuge of last resort for people who did not participate in the voluntary evacuation of the city before the storm.\n The head of New Orleans' emergency operations, Terry Ebbert, complained that the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) was not doing its job. \"This is a national emergency. This is a national disgrace,\" he said. \"FEMA has been here three days, yet there is no command and control. We can send massive amounts of aid to tsunami victims, but we can't bail out New Orleans.\" Ebbert also said he hasn't seen \"a single FEMA guy\" at the Superdome Wednesday (the main staging area was 6 miles away along the adjoining I-10 at the Causeway intersection); the photo at right had been taken three days earlier by a FEMA worker before the storm. FEMA estimated the damage in all states affected where 637,994 people usually live.\nWeb pundits suggest that Mike Brown, the head of FEMA, will \"be chosen to take the fall\" for the poor response. A critic at the International Arabian Horse Association, which previously fired Mike Brown, said \"He was an unmitigated, total...disaster. I was shocked as hell when captain clueless (\"a reference to President G.W. Bush\") put him in charge of FEMA a couple of years ago.\" It has also been suggested that the impact of the philosophy of privatization has damaged federal emergency response, but the validity of such claims has not been assessed. \nNot all federal agencies are being blasted for their role in exacerbating the disaster. In particular, the Coast Guard has been lauded for its rescue efforts, which began immediately. There was been widespread criticism of the failure to mobilize National Guard units from other states. Such units have now been deployed, but the debate over their slow deployment will rage for some time. Sunday the \"Washington Post\" reported that Louisiana did not reach out to a multi-state mutual aid compact for assistance until Wednesday.\nA significant component of the criticism directed at federal and state governments has been the lack of access given to local volunteers and the Red Cross. Local officials, especially Mayor Nagin, have been harshly criticized for failing to follow existing evacuation plans. In particular, aerial photographs show numerous unused city school buses, which were to have been used in the evacuation.\nOver twenty-five nations, some with assets in the area, have offered aid to the city of New Orleans, but the president has refused all material aid from foreign nations. Such refusal of aid is not uncommon among nations with coldy hostile relationships, such as between the U.S. and Cuba or Venezuela, but it has created a stir among the European media.\nAs of September 4th, the US has extended a \"wish list\" largely duplicating the offer from Germany. German supplies, including an airborne hospital are expected to arrive September 5th. The US has also asked the EU and NATO for assistance. \nExternal media.\nNew Orleans Mayor Ray Nagin's radio commentary - September 1 (MP3 format)"}

The biodiesel mandate was approved by the 2002 state legislature, and was sent to then-Governor Jesse Ventura. Ventura allowed the bill to become law without his signature, stating his concern that the increased cost of fuel would affect the trucking industry\u2014potentially spurring inflation\u2014though he felt that this was nearly balanced by the positive impact the mandate would have on agriculture in the state.\nThe law had an initial target date of July 1, 2005, but would only go into effect once production capacity exceeded 8 million gallons (30 millon liters) per year. At the beginning of 2005, the state was only capable of producing three million gallons each year, but two new facilities in Albert Lea and Brewster increased state capacity twentyfold when they opened this summer. Each of the two new plants can produce 30 million gallons (113 ML) annually. Agriculture Commissioner Gene Hugoson verified production levels in the August 29 edition of the Minnesota State Register, meaning that the law will become effective following a month-long notification period.\nThe prices of diesel and biodiesel have equalized, so the negative economic impact initially feared by Ventura are not expected to come to pass and the effect should be pennies more or less per gallon. Despite the dramatic increase in capacity, biodiesel production is not yet a broad solution to shortages or high prices\u2014in 2001, the state used 14.3 million gallons of petroleum every day.\nSources.\n "}

Their traditional ceremony for the She-Elephant includes dancing and building a wind-break for her out of reeds.\nThe King's current wives include Inkhosikati LaMatsebula, Inkhosikati LaMotsa, Inkhosikati LaMbikiza, Inkhosikati LaNgangaza, Inkhosikati LaHwala, Inkhosikati LaMagwaza, Inkhosikati LaMasango, Inkhosikati LaGija, Inkhosikati LaMagongo, and Inkhosikati LaMahlangu. LaMbikiza has a Master's Degree in Law.\nHe has 27 children from his first 13 wives and wives-to-be, and over 200 brothers and sisters, a result of his late father King Sobhuza II's 70 wives. Mswati must look after all of these relatives with funds from the royal-owned company, Tibiyo TakaNgwane.\nAt the Reed Dance, Mswati repealed the law prohibiting sexual activity for girls younger than 18. This law was first enacted in 2001, to help in the fight against AIDS, which was, and still is, at crisis levels. The ban was set to end in 2006. The law was actually a revival of the ancient \"umchwasho\" rite, a Swazi tradition. In the first weeks this law was enacted, Mswati broke it himself, marrying Inkhosikati LaMagongo. This forced him to pay a fine of one cow.\nForty-percent of Swazis are HIV positive, including 42% of pregnant women, a matter that the King was taken to heart, to some extent. He has travelled internationally to try and raise money, increase awareness, and seek solutions to the epidemic. World-renowned musicians like Michael Jackson have signed on to record an album, to raise funds for orphans in the country. However, the young king does not seem to have realised the importance of leadership by personal example, and the Swaziland Ministry of Health website shows little evidence of his government's commitment to address the issue.\nThe King says he is suffering from stress, finding it difficult to cope with the pressure of work. He told BBC News \"I find very little time with my family most of the time. I normally work until 11pm... and this makes me feel stressed because I'm being overworked, but I have to do everything possible to satisfy my people.\""}

President Bush was criticized for verbally \"pandering\" to public opinion, while little is done about the tragedy. In a WWL radio interview, New Orleans Mayor Ray Nagin called for a \"moratorium on press conferences\" and said, \"[The government is] feeding the public a line of bull, and they are spinning, and people are dying.\" The mayor has since apologised for these remarks. However, the mayor did not address his own alleged failure to evacuate his citizens when he reportedly left hundreds of city-controlled buses idle.\nMalik Rahim, a recent Green Party candidate for New Orleans City Council, describes the poor organization as criminal, and called for his party to come help when the federal government would permit it. Grammy award-winning rapper Kanye West created controversy when he said \"George Bush doesn't care about black people\" and that \"America is set up to help the poor, the black people, the less well-off as slow as possible\" in a telethon for victims of Hurricane Katrina.\nOnsite television news reporters have also levied very harsh criticism against the politicians whom they were interviewing. Anderson Cooper (CNN) took Sen. Mary Landrieu (D., Louisiana) to task for her detachment (WMV, trancsript). Andrea Mitchell (MSNBC), Bill O'Reilly (FOX), Geraldo Rivera (FOX), Scarborough (MSNBC), Shepard Smith (FOX), Robert Siegel (NPR), and Paula Zahn (CNN) have also harshly criticized their interviewees (WMV). One broadcaster bitterly exclaimed \"The only difference between the chaos of New Orleans and a Third World disaster operation, was that a foreign dictator would have responded better.\"\nIn a press release issued September 3rd, 2005, Democratic Senator Mary L. Landrieu of Louisiana claims that President Bush staged a photo opportunity by having rescue equipment quickly moved into the background during the event. Senator Landrieu claims the equipment was dispersed elsewhere the next day. Landrieu says in her press release, \" ... we witnessed a hastily prepared stage set for a Presidential photo opportunity; and the desperately needed resources we saw were this morning reduced to a single, lonely piece of equipment. The good and decent people of southeast Louisiana and the Gulf Coast -- black and white, rich and poor, young and old -- deserve far better from their national government ...\" The breached levee was closed on Monday by a sequence of dump trucks building a narrow pathway across the gap toward helicopter-dropped sandbags. \nSome responses, however, have concerned themselves not with criticizing the response, but praising the hurricane itself. The American Family Association's Agape Press published praise for the hurricane's destruction as an instrument of God's mercy, in that it \"wiped out rampant sin\". Rev. Bill Shanks, pastor of New Covenant Fellowship of New Orleans, said \"God simply, I believe, in His mercy purged all of that stuff out of there -- and now we're going to start over again.\" \"New Orleans now is abortion free. New Orleans now is Mardi Gras free. New Orleans now is free of Southern Decadence and the sodomites, the witchcraft workers, false religion -- it's free of all of those things now,\" Shanks says. "}

Activist groups denounce housing and immigration policies.\nIn the night of August 25 to August 26, a fire broke out a run-down apartment building located at 20, Bd Vincent Auriol in Paris, France. The building housed a number of immigrant families from Africa. These families had squatted the building illegally, until the building was bought by the local government and ran through some charity; even then, the building did not respect applicable safety norms.\nExperts have examined the situation. While no hydrocarbons (fuel etc.) were found on the scene, the speed of the fire seems to indicate a criminal origin. For this reason, the prosecution service of Paris (\"parquet\") opened a criminal investigation for \"arson resulting in death\". An investigating magistrate has been named. Criminals face a maximal penalty of life imprisonment, though lesser criminal qualifications may be retained during the course of the enquiry.\nOn Saturday 4, protests were staged denouncing the recent fires that killed black immigrant families housed in unsafe buildings. Left-wing groups such as the Revolutionary Communist League denounced the immigration, workforce and housing policies of the center-right government, as well as its center-left predecessor, as regressive and promoting racism."}

Although the rate of ibuprofen-sensitive asthma is low, it is a concern due to the number of children who use ibuprofen and have asthma. According to Dr. Jason Debley, more than 100,000 asthmatic children are at risk for asthma attacks brought on by ibuprofen. Debley emphasized that parents and doctors of children with asthma should be careful when administering ibuprofen.\nIbuprofen-sensitive asthma attacks have been known of for quite some time, but a study has never before measured its risks and effects. According to Debley: \"Although it has been recognized for some time that (drugs like ibuprofen) can trigger...an asthma attack in some people, the prevalence of ibuprofen-sensitive asthma in children had previously not been studied in a rigorous manner.\"\nThe study was conducted in Children's Hospital in Seattle to try to determine how many asthmatic children are sensitive to ibuprofen. It was run using 100 children who have mild to moderate asthma. \nThe child subjects were given either ibuprofen or a placebo in the trial. Within two hours of ibuprofen administration, four percent of the subjects exhibited decreased lung function by more than 15 percent; none of the placebo group children experienced this decrease.\nDebley notes that ibuprofen should be given to children with asthma cautiously. He also warns that there may be a higher risk of decreased lung function after ibuprofen has been given to kids with more severe asthma. Parents and doctors should be aware of this and act accordingly."}

The government owns 51.8%, with the remaining 48.2% of Telstra stock held by shareholders, having been partially floated in the 1990s.\nPhil Burgess, senior executive, made comments that Telstra was \"a loser\" hindered by excessive regulations and that he would not recommend purchasing the shares to his mother. The government responded, with Treasurer Peter Costello telling the Telstra management to manage the company and leave industry regulation to the government. Prime Minister John Howard repeated those sentiments, saying Telstra's problem was government ownership over government regulation.\nThere are plans for introducing legislation next week which will approve the sale of the remainder of the government's share. This is the first time such legislation will have gone through the Senate with the Coalition, consisting of the Liberal and National parties, controlling both the Senate and the House of Representatives. This may allow the predominantly Liberal-backed proposal to be passed. However, members of the National Party have spoken out against full privatisation, citing concerns over the future of less profitable rural services. A major base of support for the National Party is in rural areas.\nTwo major financial institutions divested their Telstra stock as shares dropped to their lowest point since mid last year."}

Several million vials of encephalitis vaccine have also been promised by the government, which will help prepare health agencies for next year. Plans for vaccines to be delivered to the historically most affected areas this year were delayed due to lack of funds and low prioritisation relative to other diseases.\nThis is not the first time such an event has occurred.

Louisiana Governor Kathleen Babineaux Blanco commented, \"The buses could have saved an estimated 20,000 people if they had been used for emergency evacuations which President Bush had declared two days before Katrina hit.\", however the evacuation was ordered by Mayor Nagin, President Bush having no direct authority to order evacuations. Thursday, after the storm, Blanco by executive order used school buses for evacuation. \nThe 2000 edition of the southeast Louisiana evacuation plan on page 13, paragraph 5 states:\nThere were however alternative emergency plans, including ones held by state Homeland Security offices, and it is unclear which one was being operated to.\nThe Superdome had been opened shortly before the storm as a shelter of last resort for those who had not evacuated. As FEMA observed at that time: \"Most residents have evacuated the city and those left behind do not have transportation or have special needs.\" Roughly 150,000 people were not evacuated from the city. During the Hurricane Ivan evacuation 600,000 people failed to evacute the city.\nAccording to WWLTV, during a news conference on Sunday before the hurricane struck, Mayor Nagin claimed he \"could and would commandeer any property or vehicle it deemed necessary to provide safe shelter or transport for those in need\". However photos circulated appear to show unused school and privately owned busses left stranded in flood waters. \nIt is unclear whether Mayor Nagin knew these particular buses existed, since the Orleans Parish School Board is not under his jurisdiction and his office would not normally know the location of OPSB bus yards or be able to contact the drivers of those buses to place them into service. Normally it is the job of FEMA to coordinate between the various local jurisdictions such as the OPSB and the City of New Orleans in this case. That is, under the rules of prior hurricane responses, FEMA would ask all local jurisdictions for a list of resources under their control. Then FEMA would have taken a request from Nagin for buses, relayed it to the Orleans Parish School Board or other local jurisdictions which had buses, and at that point the OPSB would have provided the buses to Nagin. That coordination did not happen here, but it is unclear whether Nagin ever made such a request prior to the hurricane and after the hurricane they were underwater and useless. \nHowever, if he had known about them, the declaration of a state of emergency on August 26 gave him the right under Louisiana law to commandeer them for the duration of the emergency. The failure to issue a timely evacuation order in effect made it physically impossible to evacuate the nursing homes, hospitals, and those without automobiles.\nIn a radio interview on WWL-AM shortly after the hurricane, Mayor Nagin said, \" I need 500 buses, man. We ain't talking about -- you know, one of the briefings we had, they were talking about getting public school bus drivers to come down here and bus people out here. I'm like, \"You got to be kidding me. This is a national disaster. Get every doggone Greyhound bus line in the country and get their asses moving to New Orleans.\" \""}

In 2004, federal officials classified 15.6 million new documents, which is 81 percent more than in 2001. Over the same period, the cost of classifying those new documents rose from $4.7 billion to $7.2 billion. These figures do not include documents classified by the CIA, as that agency's information is itself secret.\nThe report is also critical of the fact that only $48.3 million was spent on declassifying old documents in 2004. They concluded that for every dollar spent on declassification, the federal officials spent $148 creating and storing new secrets, more than in any previous year. It is estimated to cost $460 to classify one document.\nThe state secrets privilege allows the executive branch to classify federal court hearings and documents. On average, the Bush administration has used this privilege 33 times more per year than cold war administrations (1953-1976), and nearly three times the 1977-2001 average. The report sees other measures of government secrecy, such as the number of secret patents on the rise as well.\nThe report does not explore the larger economic impact of the increase in secrecy per se. However, it observes that taxpayer savings due to whistleblower activity is on the rise despite the elimination of traditional whistleblower protections.\nIt also notes that 64% of advisory meetings were closed to the public. Such meetings provide lawmakers with advice on scientific and technical matters which are supposed to be free of special interest. Legislation covering such meetings states or assumes that they are open to the public, but some agencies, like the Department of Defense, have traditionally been permitted to hold closed meetings. Once such agencies are excluded, the report finds a threefold increase in closed meetings since 2001.\nThe report is critical of poor funding for processing Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests, with which the majority of federal agencies surveyed can not keep up. There is concern that more of the financial burden for such requests may be being born by those organizations making the requests, instead of the agencies holding the classified documents. FOIA requests increased by 25% between 2003 and 2004, to 4 million, while funding for processing such requests increased by only 5%. \nHow much of this secrecy directly relates to various current events, such as the War in Iraq or terrorism, is unclear. In 2004, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court approved 1,754 requests from law enforcement officials last year to conduct surveillance on foreign nationals within the United States, double the number issued four years ago.\nThe report is also critical of the rise of \"sensitive but unclassified\" information, as well as new state based secrecy initiatives."}

In June, the EU member states agreed to raise the limit by approximately 10%, but EU importers and Chinese producers continue to push for a greater amount of trade.\nConcerns on textiles imported from Asia have split the EU countries: those with strong retail sector support increasing the quotas, while others, which have large clothing industries (Spain, Portugal, Italy) want to keep, or even reduce, limits in the future.\nA similar dispute exists between China and the United States.

The comments were made at a party function approximately twelve hours after Brogden's suicide attempt. Abbott is also reported to have said \"I just want to make it clear I have never told an inappropriate joke, I've never pinched a woman on the backside and I never make inappropriate gestures to women\" at a Kenthurst Liberal Party branch meeting, in reference to Brogden's reported behaviour at a function approximately two months ago.\nThere have been calls for Abbott to resign or be sacked by Prime Minister John Howard from some sectors, such as persons involved in mental health care, as well as the Federal Opposition. They claim that the comments show that Abbott is not mindful of mental health issues when they should be foremost in his mind.\nThe comments were first raised with Abbott by the ABC \"Insiders\" program yesterday. He confirmed that he had made the remarks and offered to apologize \"if anyone is upset\", and later that day made such an apology. The extent of the apology was criticised in the House of Representatives in Federal Parliament that day, with Julia Gillard, the Shadow Health Minister, calling it \"half-arsed\" during debate on a motion to censure the minister for his comments. The motion was rejected as the Liberal/National coalition form Government federally.\nThere is suspicion that the tipoff about Abbott's comments was made by a member of the left-wing faction of the Liberal party, of which Brogden was a member, as a form of payback against members of the right-wing faction, of which Tony Abbott is a member. The Liberal right are said to have been involved in the campaign against Brogden."}

Sharman has said it will appeal.\nIt is unclear whether this will have a significant effect on preventing piracy in the music industry.

This trend amongst users was also observed to happen with Grokster and Napster, two legacy peer-to-peer networks which faced similar suits.\nThis is not the first case in which Sharman has had to defend itself: in a related case in the U.S. Supreme Court which concluded two months ago, the court ruled that file sharing networks could be held responsible for the actions of their users in some circumstances.

Landrieu of Louisiana claims that President Bush staged a photo opportunity, at the breached 17th Street levee, by having equipment quickly moved into the background during the event. Senator Landrieu says the equipment was dispersed elsewhere the next day, but did not provide details. \nLandrieu says in her press release, \" ... we witnessed a hastily prepared stage set for a Presidential photo opportunity; and the desperately needed resources we saw were this morning reduced to a single, lonely piece of equipment. The good and decent people of southeast Louisiana and the Gulf Coast -- black and white, rich and poor, young and old -- deserve far better from their national government ...\"\nThe President and Senator Landrieu toured the 17th Street levee on Friday, and held the photo-op. Senator Landrieu said she believed the repair effort was legitimate, at that time. Less than 24 hours later, she discovered only \"one lonely crane\" working on the site, while giving an aerial tour for ABC's This Week with George Stephanopoulos. A video of her tearful comments, during that tour, has been circulating around the internet (WMV). \nSenator Landrieu made no specific accusations about the photo-op during the ABC tour. However, neither does her press release describe any measures taken to verify that equipment was in-fact pulled from other projects for the purpose of the photo-op, nor where the equipment is now. The canal wall breach, near Hammond Highway, was later shown Sunday on CBS' \"60 Minutes\" with dump trucks and a power shovel building a single-lane pathway across the gap. The breach was closed Monday.\nSenator Landrieu was herself criticized by Anderson Cooper (CNN) on Thursday, after she responded to a question by rattling off a list of \"thank yous\" to other politicians (WMV, transcript). Democratic pundits have excused such detachment as an attempt to gain more federal assistance during the tragedy. Senator Landrieu's press release partially confirms this interpretation by attempting to simultaneously ask the president for more aid, while accusing him of misusing existing resources. \n17th Street Canal engineering.\nAlthough press reports mentioned the 17th Street Canal breach was blocked by the use of metal sheets, sandbags, and dumped fill, details were not available. On Wednesday September 7 it was reported that earlier metal girders, often used for retaining walls, had been hung down from the north side of the Hammond Highway bridge so as to form a metal wall which blocked the canal from the lake. After the breach had been closed, by sandbags and fill delivered by dump truck, the metal wall was opened to allow draining of the city through the canal.\nObviously placing the metal wall required an assortment of equipment which was no longer needed after it was in place. The wall was only visible from the bridge and most dry land as a few feet of metal along the bridge railing. It is not known if Senator Landrieu noticed this work of engineering, nor if she had been briefed as to what was being done.\nHowever, photos of work at the site were later found which showed a lot of activity Sept 4, after Landrieu said the equipment was not there. However, the sheet piling wall in the photo was reported to have been completed September 2. Information of the schedule of similar work at the London Avenue breach has not been found.\nBiloxi event.\nIn related news, Germany's ZDF News reported that the president's visit to Biloxi was largely a staged event(video). Their onsite crew claimed that an \"open air food distribution point Bush visited in front of the cameras was torn down immediately after the president and the herd of news people had left\", and alleges that others being set up were abandoned at the same time. Christine Adelhardt of Germany's ARD Tagesschau said \"the extent of the staging is shocking me [as much as the disaster.]\" She also claimed that, for the purpose of such photo-ops, heavy equipment was being moved to areas which would not require it (video). Senator Landrieu has not complained about any other staged photo-ops, nor has the American press accused the president's press team off any impropriety."}

Flights from New Orleans to Salt Lake City International Airport provided by JetBlue Airways under a contract from FEMA have been shuttling people from New Orleans to many destinations throughout the United States, including Utah. \nIn addition, Utah Air National Guard relief missions transporting food and other supplies to New Orleans relief efforts have also been returning with people in the cargo areas of the airplanes on return flights. \"In keeping with our mission to assist in the security and safety of our homeland, we stand trained, ready, and able to respond to the call to assist our fellow citizens in Louisiana, Mississippi and elsewhere,\" said Maj. Gen. Brian Tarbet, Utah National Guard Adjutant General.\nThe people on board the airplanes had no idea where they were going. In one case the airplane was headed to San Antonio and at the last minute while still airborne the destination was changed to Utah. Peter Coroon, Salt Lake County Mayor: \"Some of the people look dazed. Some of them are just happy to be out of where they were. Some of them are eager to find their loves ones they've been separated. Some of them weren't sure where they were going when they left New Orleans.\" \nGovernor John Huntsman, Jr. utilized surplus state funds by declaring a state of emergency to begin efforts housing and clothing people coming to Utah, however some of this will likely be reimbursed by the Federal Government at a later date. He announced that Utah was willing to take up to 1,000 people at shelters in Utah, and that amount was later increased to over 2,000. On Monday, President Bush signed an executive order granting the emergency declaration in Utah to provide Federal assistance for the evacuees in Utah.\nAfter arriving in Utah, one evacuee said \"I want to thank the people of Utah for their hospitality and for restoring my faith in America.\" Another evacuee said \"it seems like heaven, looking at the mountains and getting a breath of fresh air and saying, 'Thank God we made it.'\"\nNot all evacuees were pleased with the move to Utah. \"I knew where Utah was, but nobody told me that's where we were going. Nothing personal. It's nice. But I don't know anybody here,\" said Bergeron, among the first batch of 152 evacuees to arrive at the Camp Williams Utah Army National Guard training site.\nThe Utah chapter of the American Red Cross has been training volunteers over the Labor Day weekend, and according to one official they have been overwhelmed with community support to help the evacuees. The line of volunteers to receive the training helping those at Camp Williams was litterally out of the door at the Red Cross offices today. One volunteer, Kayelynn Wright said, \"The last couple of days we\u2019d talked about it and said, 'What can we do?' So when I saw it (a call for volunteers) last night, I called (my neighbor) this morning and said, 'We gotta go!'\" The Red Cross has asked that you contact the local office if you plan on volunteering or donating any new clothing and other items to help the evacuees.\nVolunteers from The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints on Saturday gathered at the LDS Humanitarian Center in Salt Lake to assemble more than 50,000 hygiene kits for hurricane victims. Plastic bags were stuffed with toothbrushes and toothpaste, combs, soap, washcloths and hand towels. The supplies will be shipped to a church-owned storehouse Georgia for distribution. \nTransportation requests are also being honored by the Utah state government, and evacuees are having transportation to anywhere in the United States paid for at state expense. In addition, a small amount of extra money is being donated directly to each family to help with immediate expenses. The Utah Transit Authority has already established a regular municipal bus service between Camp William and downtown Salt Lake City, which will begin formal service starting tomorrow morning."}

The Labor Party has been particularly scathing in its attacks. \n\"The bottom line is this: when it comes to helping Australians on the ground, the Australian Government has failed miserably to persuade its closest friend and ally - the United States Government - to allow Australian consular officials access to help our own people,\" said opposition defence spokesman Kevin Rudd. Mr Rudd was referring to the US governments refusal of a request by Australian consular officials to enter New Orleans and search for Australians. \n\"You need a few days to allow people to assess the situation and to deploy personnel. But a week later, we have one official go in and can only stay there until night-time and then has to skedaddle out of there. I mean, what's happening here?

Former Federal Liberal Pary Minister Wilson Tuckey attacked the victims, suggesting that they should have left New Orleans earlier. \n\"Why was the woman quoted by the Leader of the Opposition today so insistent, not that the Prime Minister get her out of her problems, but the Australian taxpayer get her out of her problems, when in fact all the warnings we heard here in Australia [said it] was unwise to stay,\" he said.

This discovery was made after astronomers compiled results predominantly from the Voyager 2 spacecraft, which passed Saturn in 1981, and the Cassini-Huygens probe which entered Saturn's orbit last year. \nOther rings were found to be rotating slower than had previously been estimated with computer models. It was also discovered that the matter composing the rings is of far more widely varying temperatures than had been expected. Sections of Saturn's F ring were also recognised as breaking apart and reforming, depending on the location of one of Saturn's moons.\nThe rings, which are now iconic to Saturn, and known to be common to all Jovian planets in general, were first observed in 1610 by Galileo. The rings have recently become a subject of scientific interest to modern astronomers who believe they are similar in structure to the dust which orbited the Sun, in a similar pattern, and formed the planets some 4.5 billion years ago.\nThis, and other Cassini-related discoveries, were discussed at a meeting of the American Astronomical Society's division of planetary sciences on Monday."}

They currently count more than 232,000 such files. \nAll of \"Commons\" content is published under a free licence, so the use of its files is permitted outside the project itself. Its main mission is to provide the international \"Wikipedias\" with images. Like \"Wikipedia\", the \"Commons\" is based on a simple wiki principle that permits every user to contribute and change content. The project is organized into so-called gallery pages, and/or by adding files into categories organized in multiple topics that help facilitate the speedy location of desired files. Often it exists already a direct link from the \"Wikipedia\" page to the corresponding page in the Commons.\nThe \"Wikimedia Commons\" proposal was originated by the German Erik M\u00f6ller, (Eloquence), in March 2004. Eloquence was until recently the Chief Research Officer of the \"Wikimedia Foundation\". Up until the launch of \"Commons\", it was time consuming to use material from one \"Wikipedia\" language project in a sister project of a different language. Each file had to be uploaded into each language edition of \"Wikipedia\", and be described and licensed again. The goal was to reduce this redundant effort into one upload, which it can be said that this was successful. \nThe language in use on the project's Main Page is English because it is an international project, but many information pages exist in multiple languages. Judging by the experience of other \"Wikimedia Foundation\" projects, it is only a question of time before further localization occurs at \"Commons\". This will make it easier for users with fewer skills in foreign languages to also contribute files.\nThe content in the \"Commons\" is growing at a rapid pace. Within the last month alone, the number of images and other files has grown by more than 43,000. This represents a 22,7 % increase in relation to the prior month. While the \"Wikipedia\" projects usually compare themselves with the more widely known encyclopedias like Britannica and Brockhaus, a competitor \"Commons\" would likely be considered the huge commercial photo archives like Getty Images and Corbis, who possess more than 70 million images each. In relation to them, the \"Commons\" is very small at the moment. However, most of the important buildings and landmarks world wide are already featured in its database. \nLike other \"Wikimedia Foundation\" projects, the \"Commons\" face certain challenges and problems. Sometimes people upload offensive images. The community has had to establish clear criteria about which content is acceptable, and which is not. There should not be unfair censorship. Obvious transgressions can be pointed out by anybody, and they are usually deleted rapidly by the administrators.\nA sensitive topic is copyrights, and the rights of the owner of the pictured images. International rules have not yet been made compatible. In certain ways, the \"Wikimedia Foundation\" opens new territory in the area of intellectual property. Before \"Commons\", it was almost exclusively a domain of professionals to publish images who were well aware of the legal issues. Now it is possible for huge numbers of photo amateurs to publish. Like with offensive content, obvious violations of copyright are deleted the moment they are brought to notice of the administrators. However, it is quite possible there will be an upcoming international debate if the free publication of certain content, e.g. images of national heritage objects, is in the overwhelming public interest. In cases such as this, private interests which might prevent publication are of lesser importance.\nThe contribution of \"Wikimedia Commons\" to a wide array of issues in research, reporting, education, tourism or others, at a global scale, is difficult to fathom at the moment. Most likely though the impact will be gigantic. \nSources.\n&lt;br&gt;"}

The show, which ran for four years, was Denver's first major acting role. It is said that the popular cartoon \"Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!\" was based on the show, and Denver's role of Krebs was the inspiration for the character \"Shaggy\".\nDenver's real fame, however, came with the role of \"Gilligan\", a kind but naive and incompetent bumbler stuck on an island with six other castaways. Nearly every episode involved a plot to get off the island; however, Gilligan always ended up causing the plot to fail, in one way or another. The show, which ran for three years, gained popularity through perpetual reruns. \"It was the mid-'70s when I realized it wasn't going off the air,\" Denver said in 2001.\nAfter the cancellation of \"Gilligan's Island\", Bob Denver starred in \"Dusty's Trail\", a clone of \"Gilligan's Island\", set in a wagon train in the old American West.

Bob Denver was the only actor in common. The show never caught on and was quickly canceled.\nIn May, Denver underwent quadruple bypass surgery, and was subsequently diagnosed with cancer. He died of complications from his cancer treatment at Wake Forest University Baptist Hospital in North Carolina.\nDenver is survived by his wife and four children.\nSources.\n \n "}

Details are few, but one example of a confessed crime is the mass killing of the Kurds in the late 1980s, which resulted in the deaths of thousands of Kurds. \nTalabani says that Saddam deserves to be hanged \"20 times a day,\" although he does not wish to sign his death warrant; he wants his vice president, Adel Abdel Mehdi, to do so. According to Talabani, this gesture is not meant to gain power over the courts, \"My not signing does not mean that I will block the decision of the court.\" Talabani is morally opposed to all capital punishment.\nTalabani also stated that \"There are 100 reasons to sentence Saddam to death.\"\nIraq seems to be starting a general trend of cracking down on criminals \u2013 three were hanged just last week, with possibly more to come.\nSaddam's first trial comes October 19, where he will be tried for the mass killings of Shiite civilians in a town in northern Baghdad in 1982.

Nor was there much success in coordinating so large a program among UN Agencies accustomed to zealously defending their institutional autonomy.\nThere were Iraqi attempts to pass money to former Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali, principally through an Iraqi-American businessman, Samir Vincent, and a Korean lobbyist, Tongsun Park. The Committee has determined that well over $1 million was paid to Mr. Vincent and Mr. Park. However, the Committee has not found evidence that Secretary-General Boutros-Ghali received or agreed to receive monies from Mr. Park and Mr. Vincent.\nThe report recommended better oversight and management, financial disclosure by more UN staff, and that UN agencies should return up to $50 million in excess compensation secured as a result of work performed under Security Council Resolution 1483.\nThe Committee's Chairman, Paul A Volcker, stated, \"The inescapable conclusion from the Committee's work is that the United Nations Organization needs thoroughgoing reform\u2014and it needs it urgently. What is important\u2014what has been recognized by one investigation after another\u2014is that real change must take place, and change over a wide area. Clear benchmarks for measuring progress must be set. The General Assembly should insist, in its forthcoming meeting, that key reforms be put in place no later than the time of its regular meeting in 2006. To settle for less, to permit delay and dilution, would be to invite failure. It would, in reality, further erode public support, undercut effectiveness, and dishonor the ideals upon which the United Nations is built.\"\nHe added, \"Before concluding its work, the Committee also intends a more comprehensive listing of firms participating in the Programme, either in the purchase of oil or the sale of humanitarian goods, as well as a more detailed analysis of the manner in which Iraq and its vendors and oil purchasers unlawfully manipulated the Programme.\" "}

Hurricane Katrina has damaged several NASA facilities, including not only the Kennedy Space Center, but more importantly the Michoud Assembly Facility in New Orleans itself and the Stennis Space Center on the gulf coast of Mississippi, both major worksites of NASA subcontractors that help with the servicing of parts for the shuttle. \nThe Michoud New Orleans facility is the primary manufacturing facility for the external fuel tanks that are used on Shuttle launches. The Stennis Space Center is the manufacturing and test center for the main shuttle rocket engines. NASA is still trying to contact employees who have been evacuated from the New Orleans and Gulf Coast areas who have not reported to work due to the disaster and current situation in New Orleans. NASA announced that the Michoud Assembly Facility will not reopen until September 26th at the earliest.\nThere have been many setbacks for the Shuttle program as well. Hurricane Katrina simply added to these problems. Hurricane Ophelia forced the facilities at the Kennedy Space Center to go into a weather protection status, returning the shuttle Atlantis back to its hanger from the Vehicle Assembly building. The external fuel tank that was earlier scheduled to return to New Orleans prior to Katrina for some minor repairs had to be secured from the storm. \"MSNBC\" reported that Wayne Hale, NASA\u2019s deputy shuttle program manager, suggests that it may be over a year before they can get back to flying another shuttle mission.\nAmong other problems facing NASA, employees at these damaged facilities have faced very personal losses. Some have lost family members, their homes, and more. In some cases, NASA has been unable to locate employees, or employees of contractors. For those that have been located, many of them from New Orleans are being transferred either to the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, or to the Marshall Space Center in Huntsville, Alabama. \nAt the Stennis Space Center, they at first attempted to put the facility to use as an evacuee center to take in some people coming from out of New Orleans. As of Wednesday, those plans were dropped when evacuees were being transferred to other facilities better equipped to deal with their long term needs. The center is now focusing on efforts to recover from the damage to the facility itself. \nAt the Michoud Assembly Facility, the U.S. Marine Corp is also using it as a staging area for its operations in New Orleans, and as a temporary military base."}

Assuming development is successful, consumers could expect to see such a device on store shelves next year.\nBlu-Ray and HD DVD are projected to be the successor formats for current DVDs. Samsung, while leaning towards the Blu-Ray camp, hopes it can cover both bases by distributing a player with dual-compatibility. While this means spending more in development to unify the two technologies and develop a cost-effective production method, dual compatibility may pay off for the company if the formats challenge each other as VHS and Betamax did twenty-five years ago. Despite the support for Blu-Ray, Samsung has also been supportive of a unified standard to avoid such costly competition.\nHD DVD offers single layer capacity of 15GB, more than triple the size of standard single layer DVDs, and benefits from similarities with current DVDs, such as cheap production and compatibility with current DVD players. Blu-Ray can hold 23GB on its smallest single layer version, and is reported to have superior durability and interactivity over current DVD-based technology and HD-DVD. HD-DVD is currently promoted by Toshiba, NEC, Sanyo and Microsoft; while Blu-Ray's base of support is the Blu-Ray Disc Association, which is led by Blu-Ray developers Sony and Philips. It is notable that Sony and Philips, who developed the Blu-Ray format, also competed against the Toshiba-designed SuperDisc DVD standard, which is the standard that is followed today.\nThe first Blu-Ray and HD DVD products are expected to start appearing in mainstream markets within the next year."}

These kiosks are built from donated computers, many of which are unable to run Windows and/or Internet Explorer.

Mike Quealy, a FEMA spokesperson, said the issue occurred because this tool was originally designed for in-house use by people working at the call center.\nTelling the Opera web browser to spoof its user agent, by identifying itself as Internet Explorer, appears to trick the FEMA website into allowing the user to fill out the form.

Safari users can use the Debug drop-down menu (http://developer.apple.com/internet/safari/faq.html#anchor14), and use the \"User Agent\" option to achieve the same effect. Other options are to run Windows and Internet Explorer in an emulator such as VirtualPC on the Mac or VMware on Linux. This option is slow and requires the user to already own or purchase a license for Windows and the emulator software. Purchasing the software can cost several hundred dollars. Implementing a software compatibility layer, like the GPL wine project, allows the user to run certain Windows software on Linux, but still requires valid licenses for Windows."}

According to a CityRail spokeswoman, they were not aware that the train was going to be stopping at Harris Park.\n\"The fault is with the guard and they have been disciplined accordingly,\" the spokeswoman said. \nWhen questioned about reports of the guard laughing at passengers on the platform, the spokeswoman said that she had no information that this had occurred. She said that it was possible that the guards did not even realise that they were stopped at a station. Video footage from the station was used during the investigation. \nMany commuters have expressed their dissatisfaction at the state of the rail network for some time, with many writing to major Sydney newspapers. As a result, timetable changes have been implemented by CityRail and the New South Wales state government, justifying the changes as being necessary to improve safety and reliability. The new CityRail timetable, which commenced on September 1, resulted in a decreased service from Harris Park. There are now only two city trains departing between 8am and 9am, down from the previous four - the next train from that station to arrive after 9:12am is at 9:42am."}

Amongst those dismissed was Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko.\nYushchenko, who won the Presidency almost one year ago, in what became known worldwide as the \"Orange Revolution\" had vowed to stamp out the corruption that was widespread under Leonid Kuchma. Most of the dismissed officials took part in the revolution that swept the popular Yushchenko into power.\nYushchenko announced that Yuriy Yekhanurov, governor of the Dnipropetrovsk province would replace Tymoshenko, as PM and form a new government. He also claimed that he wanted to give a fresh start to an administration that he said failed to meet the high expectations of supporters.\nAccording to Yushchenko, the dismissed officials \"...remain my friends. It is very difficult but today I must remove this Gordian knot,\" criticising the dismissed officials for lack of team spirit.\nIt is hoped by analysts that the technocratic Yekhanurov would help strengthen the country's economy, which has suffered recently from a sharp downturn and inflation.\nThe move is seen as leading to a possible standoff between the President and his dismissed Prime Minister in the upcoming 2006 parliamentary elections, as Tymoshenko is both a powerful political figure and leads her own party alliance. Tymoshenko had a notable role within the Orange Revolution as a public speaker whose speeches brought thousands of supporters to the Yushchenko camp, in a revolution that caught the world's attention. She was recently named the third most powerful woman in the world, behind such major political figures as U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and Wu Yi of the People's Republic of China.\nThere had been noted friction between the President and Prime Minister in recent months, largely over the country's economy. The friction ultimately led the resignation of Yushchenko's chief of staff, who cited deep corruption within the administration. This friction may make it difficult for Yekhanurov to be confirmed by the parliament, in which the Pro-Yushchenko groups do not control a majority.\nAccording to the Ukrainian Constitution, special elections to the Verkhovna Rada (Ukrainian parliament) can be called by the President to be held within sixty days of the initial call. As of yet, with the March elections around the corner, there appears to be no indication that Yushchenko will be calling for special elections. \nInternational response has been mostly similar, with Russian President Vladimir Putin, the U.S. and Ukraine's neighbor, Poland downplaying the dismissals as being of no cause for alarm."}

Much of the city flooded through the openings. One of these was the flood wall forming one side of the 17th Street Canal, near Lake Pontchartrain. The (USACE) is the primary agency for engineering support during such emergencies. A USACE team was assessing the situation in New Orleans on the 29th, water flow was stopped September 2nd, and the breach was closed on September 5th.\nBackground.\nThe breaches that occurred on the levees surrounding New Orleans were located on the 17th Street Canal Levee and London Avenue Canal Levee. The floodwall atop the canal levee was one foot wide at the top and widened to two feet at the base. The visible portion is a concrete cap on steel sheet pile that anchors to the wall. Sheet piles are interlocked steel columns, in this case at least 30 feet long, with 6 to 10 feet visible above ground.\nAnother breach was on a levee by Industrial Canal, which flooded the east side of the city during the storm.\nThe 17th Street Canal Levees and London Avenue Canal Levees were completed segments of the Lake Ponchartrain and Vicinity Hurricane Protection Project. Although other portions of the Lake Ponchartrain project are pending, these two segments were complete, and no modifications or improvements to these segments were pending, proposed, or remained unfunded.\nThe Corps was authorized by Congress to do a reconnaissance study back in 1999 to provide Category 4 or 5 protection. Money was received in 2000 and the reconnaissance study was completed in 2002, which indicated there was a federal interest in proceeding with the feasibility study. Preparation for that study is still underway, and involves issues such as environmental impacts, economics, and the engineering design of the project itself. The feasibility study was scheduled to begin in fiscal year 2006. It may take six years to complete, and there was nothing that could have been done to get this level of protection in place before this storm hit.\nWithin the city there are 13 subbasins, some of which became flooded. There are existing pumping stations to remove water from the basins. Usually there is much less water to remove, and the level became too high for some pumping stations to continue operation.\nAugust 27: Before the storm.\nOne of the services of the USACE is planning, designing, building and operating dams and other civil engineering projects. It has been deeply involved in creating the navigation waterways and flood control constructions around New Orleans, although construction and operation involves various levels of state and local involvement. The Corps is well suited toward emergency activities due to its combination of engineering expertise and being a component of the nation's military forces. Assigned by the as the primary agency for Public Works and Engineering support, USACE supports during disasters.\nOn Saturday, August 27, while Katrina was a Category 3 storm gathering strength in the Gulf of Mexico, USACE's Mississippi Valley Division was preparing and posturing elements from as far as Hawaii. Anticipating the possibility of a Category 5 storm placing water in New Orleans, preparations began for un-watering operations.\nAugust 29: Day of the storm.\nUSACE District Engineer, Col. Richard Wagenaar, and a team worked out of an emergency operations shelter in New Orleans. Other teams waited in the storm's path across the Gulf coast. Corps employees assessed the situation at the 17th Street Canal floodwall that was breached overnight. Corps engineers believed that water over-topped the floodwall, scoured behind the wall, and caused it to collapse. A second breach was known to have occurred on the Industrial Canal during the storm. \nThe Corps worked with the U.S. Coast Guard, Army National Guard and other state and federal authorities to bring in all assets available to expedite the process. \"We're attempting to contract for materials, such as rock, super sand bags, cranes, etc., and also for modes of transportation \u00ad like barges and helicopters, to close the gap and stop the flow of water from into the city,\" said Walter Baumy, Engineering Division chief and project manager for closing the breach.\nPlanning for repairs involved the Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development, the East Jefferson Levee District and Orleans Levee District, to locate materials and access to the breach\narea.\nThe New Orleans District's 350 miles of hurricane levee had been built to withstand a fast-moving Category 3 storm. The fact that Katrina, a category 4-plus hurricane, didn't cause more damage is considered a testament to the structural integrity of the hurricane levee protection system.\nAugust 30: Flood.\nAt 2 or 3 AM, Corps officials got a telephone report of a suspected 17th Street Canal breach.\nFlooding had begun slowly, but the second disaster appeared as water poured in even as the winds abated. Storm surge and rainfall had raised the level of Lake Pontchartrain, providing an enormous amount of water which poured into the city. By the end of the day much of the city was under as much as 20 feet of water.\nPlans were made to begin levee work, including use of 3,000-pound sand bags on the 17 Street Canal. Army National Guard helicopters are expected to begin assisting in the operation August 31.\nAugust 31: Recovery begins.\nThe breach at the 17th Street Canal Levee, a levee-floodwall combination, is about 300 feet long. It's believed that the force of the water overtopped the floodwall and scoured the structure from behind and then moved the levee wall horizontally about 20 feet, opening both ends to flow.\nState Transportation workers began building a road toward the breach with available equipment.\nThe Corps released two contracts to close the breach in the 17th Street Canal. The 3,000 pound sandbag operation at the 17th Street Canal was postponed early in the day when U.S. Army helicopters were diverted for rescue missions. The Corps continued to coordinate with Army officials to have helicopters assist in placement of sandbags at the breaches. The 3,000 pound sandbags are each about 3 feet square.\nCorps officials worked with Orleans Parish and Louisiana Department of Transportation officials and Boh Brothers Construction Company, headquartered in New Orleans, to place piling at the lakefront to stop flow in the 17th Street Canal. This would stabilize the water flow and allow work on the levee, while also helping to stabilize the rest of the levee system.\nAlong with local and state officials, the Corps contracted to build access roads to the breach sites and to fill in the breaches. Rock/stone/crushed concrete would be hauled by truck for road construction and to repair the breaches. One plan called for building an access road from Hammond Highway to the 17th Street breach, and then southward to the end of the breach. The road would have to be built to safely permit backing and dumping of heavy materials.\nSeptember 1: Construction.\nLake Pontchartrain was almost back to normal levels, so little water flowed out of the city. This allows a change of plans, and marine equipment was used to drive sheet piling at the mouth of the 17th Street Canal to seal off the entire canal from the lake.\nShortly after 1 PM the first piece sheet piling is driven, to form a steel wall across the lake's entrance to the 17th Street canal. The opening was expected to be closed by the end of the day. A contractor began bringing in rock to build a road toward the breach. The breach was south and east of the Hammond Highway bridge over the canal, with dry land on the west side of the bridge.\nRock was being transported from offsite to complete the access road and closure at the 17th Street breach. Once the rock required to build the roads arrived in New Orleans and the access road to the breach has been completed, the Corps estimated closure of the breach could be completed in three to four days. Several private firms have volunteered services and provided assistance in design of the closure.\nThe 17th Street Canal Levee, a levee-floodwall combination, was now estimated to have a breach 450 feet long. It was still believed water overtopped the floodwall, scoured the structure, and then moved the structure 20 feet horizontally.\nSeptember 2: Water flow stopped.\nOn east side of the 17th Street Canal, closure by sheet piling of the 200-foot-wide canal was done after the Corps was confident that the lake had fallen to a normal level and water was not trapped inside the city that would otherwise drain out by gravity.\nWater could no longer flow from the lake into the city.\nWith the mouth of the canal sealed, the sheet piling prevented lake water from getting to the levee breach. Since no additional water can get through the breach it was no longer necessary to seal the breach itself. The next step is to get existing pumps working, and to bring in additional pumps to drain the surrounding city and the canal. Later, the canal can be drained so permanent repairs will be made to the levee.\nHelicopters were dropping large sandbags made of strong, synthetic materials in the breach. Heavy equipment on the ground has been placing rock. Ground access was created by building a rock road from Hammond Highway, which is about 700 feet lake-ward of the breach. The 17th Street Canal is a drainage canal whose dimensions and an important bridge, integral to the flood control system, would not permit entry of barges and towboats to haul rocks and placement cranes.\nSeptember 4: Almost done.\nWork continued on the breach. The sheet piling still blocks water from flowing in.\nSeptember 5: Breach closed.\n17th Street Canal breach was closed. After the emergency is over, the canal will be drained and the wall repaired.\n and Chinook helicopters had dropped over 200 sand bags.\nApproximately 125 sandbags had broken the surface of the water.\nThere were three 42\" mobile pumps staged and two 42\" and two 30\" pumps were placed at the sheet pile closure. Sewer &amp; water board, electric utility and 249th Prime Power Engineer Battalion were completing pump house inspection.\nWhen pumps began operation, a 40-foot-wide opening was made in the sheet piling to allow water to flow out the canal.\nSeptember 6: Pumping and moving on.\nThe pump stations began to get online on 17th Street Canal. Pump Station 10 was actually pumping at\nthis point. Pump Station 6 was interrupted to clean up some debris out of the area."}

It was also shown on the Internet and many cable networks such as USA, Bravo and G4.\nThe show was produced by Joel Gallen, the same man behind the September 11th tribute concert \"America: A Tribute to Heroes\".

Critics say that the laws are draconian, too open to abuse, and may restrict the Australian 'way of life'.\nThe government has responded by saying that the laws are necessary to ensure security due to the rising terrorist threat to Australia. It is also considering sunset clauses for some laws, to counter claims that the laws may be abused after the terror threat has ebbed. \nThere has been concern from the Muslim community that the laws are unfairly biased against Muslims.

Only three months ago, when chancellor proclaimed he would seek early elections, a move that at the time was considered to be political suicide by many commentators, it seemed not unlikely that the CDU could even govern on its own, without an coalition partner. While their lead was slowly shrinking in the past few months, there was still a comfortable majority for a coalition with the (FDP).\nThen came the TV debate between Schr\u00f6der and Merkel. Commentators and newspaper editorials first thought it didn't have much impact. Sure, the \"Media chancellor\" Schr\u00f6der was widely considered to have performed better, but that was to be expected. And Merkel certainly wasn't as bad as Schr\u00f6der's (SPD) had hoped. Also the topics they talked about weren't really new. Every position they stated had already been printed and broadcasted over and over again.\nBut something did happen. The CDU plunged between 2-3% in the various polls, while the SPD gained as much as 3.5%. Suddenly the black-yellow (named for the party colors of the CDU and FDP) majority was gone. But the current red-green (this time the colors of SPD and ) coalition is even farther from reaching a majority because there is also the .\nThe Left Party (or simply The Left) is essentially a renamed PDS, which in turn is the successor of the , the former ruling party of the . It failed the 5% quorum in the 2002 election and currently only has two representatives in the ; both won constituencies in East Berlin. The Left originally planned to merge with the , a party mainly consisting of former SPD members who were disappointed by Schr\u00f6der's social reforms, before the election which would have been held in 2006. However, they were caught off guard by the early elections call, so candidates of the WASG for the Bundestag now run under The Left banner. One of them is .\nLafontaine was the Party chair of the SPD. He was also the Finance minister in Schr\u00f6der's first government. But only a few months after the SPD got in power after 16 years of CDU government, he resigned in March 1999 from both the offices of minister and party chair, citing insurmountable political and personal differences with Schr\u00f6der. He largely stayed out of politics, writing only a few books and newspaper columns, but is now, along with , one of two front-runners of the Left Party.\nSo the Party of Left may tip the scales in this election. But all other parties have ruled out a coalition with them and The Left itself also called it impossible that a common ground could be found with the \"neoliberal\" parties currently in the Bundestag.\nSo, assuming neither black-yellow nor red-green reach a majority, what options are left? Maybe, the only remaining possibility is a grand coalition between the SPD and the CDU. But the differences between those two parties seem irreconcilable from today's viewpoint. There are radically different approaches in the fields of taxation, social and labor reforms to name only a few. Angela Merkel has recruited a jurist from the German constitutional court, , to her team. Kirchhof plans to introduce a on income, 25% for everyone, and remove all tax exemptions. While the CDU doesn't want to go that far during the next four years, it has already named Kirchhof finance minister in the case they win the election. The SPD has blasted those plans as \"radically unsocial\" and instead plans to increase the taxes for wealthier people.\nAnother hot topic is Germany's high unemployment. The CDU plans to abolish the dismissal protection of workers to give companies greater flexibilty in the hiring of their employees. Again, this is a no-go for the SPD. \nBut the two parties won't even speculate about this option. Both ruled out a coalition with each other. Nonetheless, 35% of all Germans think this coalition would be the best for the nation, a survey by the ZDF shows. That is still more than the 31% who would favor a black-yellow coalition and 17% who want a continuation of the current red-green government.\nSo, Germans have to wait for the 18th of September to know who will govern them for the next four years. But then again, it might even take two weeks longer because a by-election is required in Dresden, after a candidate died. And if it gets even closer than the aforementioned polls suggest, Germany will have to wait till October 2nd for a new, or the old government."}

In some places, automatic gunfire was heard, with police returning live fire. \nHalf a dozen police were injured, and two men were taken to hospital \u2014 one with a gunshot wound, and another was caught in the blast of an explosion.\nThe parade route was altered by the Parades Commission. The intended path of the original parade route was through a Nationalist part of Springfield Road, with the potential to result in rioting and violence (the route would have had to pass through a 30 foot high security barrier, one of the \"Peace Lines\". Unionists called for the decision to be reconsidered by the Commission; however, no change was made. Instead of passing through Springfield Road, the Orange Order parade was required to proceed through the site of the engineering firm Mackies.\nThe streets of northern and western Belfast echoed with sounds of violence not commonly heard since the late 1990s and the Troubles. Petrol and blast bombs were used by rioters, and water cannon and plastic bullets were used by police. Several cars and a bus were hijacked, and roads were closed off by mobs of people. A number of buildings were set alight with fire around the outskirts of the city.\nThroughout the night, violence spread to outlying towns around Belfast, including Ballymena, Ballyclare, Carrickfergus and Larne.\nPolice Chief Constable Hugh Orde described the rioting as perhaps the worst such situation ever seen in the United Kingdom - particularly because of the use of firearms in a public order situation. He controversially held the Orange Order responsible for the disorder, and complained about the politicians who called for people to protest. The Rev. Ian Paisley had threatened at the time of the parade rerouting decision by the Parades Commission that it \"could be the spark which kindles a fire there would be no putting out\".\nThe response of Unionist politicians has been to accuse the police of brutal and heavy-handed tactics.

He was deemed \"a threat to national security\" by the Australian Department of Immigration, according to a spokesperson from Anti-Deportation Alliance. The ABC has reported that the Federal police have confirmed an American man was arrested on the orders of the Immigration Department (DIMIA) and is in custody.\nMr Parkin, a native of Houston, Texas, USA, participated in an anti- war-profiteering protest outside Halliburton in Sydney on August 31, and was also reported to have attended the Forbes Global CEO Conference protest.\nLiz Thompson from the National Anti-Deportation Alliance (NADA) said Mr Parkin was held by Federal Police at Carlton West police station before being moved to Melbourne Custody Centre on Saturday September 10. She said the incident seemed to contradict Philip Ruddock's denial that Australia was turning into a police state.\n\"This is a major attack on dissent, free speech and the anti-war movement. This should be a warning to everyone about the greater powers that ASIO may soon be granted,\" Ms Thompson said. She was referring to the proposed legislation to increase police and ASIO powers in dealing with suspected terrorists. \nFederal Attorney-General Phillip Ruddock stated that he knew of the case, and that it was an issue for the Immigration Minister. He said that a security assessment of Mr Parkin had been conducted, and it was this security assessment that provided the basis for the decision to revoke his visa. \n\"I understand the decision was based upon a security assessment, and security assessments are not something about which I can comment in any detail,\" he said. \"I understand it's a decision that's been taken by the Minister for Immigration and that there may be legal proceedings surrounding it.\"\nSpokesperson for the Brisbane Peace Convergence Kim Stewart said Mr Parkin's detention and deportation posed a \"dangerous precedent to free speech in Australia\".\n\"By arresting and threatening to deport Mr Parkin, the government is already using its power to silence non-violent peace campaigners and discourage peaceful dissent in our community,\" Ms Stewart said.\nJulian Burnside QC, a prominent human rights lawyer, asked why it took so long for authorities to act if indeed Mr Parkin is a security threat.\n\"They've got the right but the question is whether that right has been exercised in a way that provides sufficient protection for ordinary citizens of Australia,\" he said.\nGreens Senator Bob Brown also criticised the arrest, suggesting that pressure may have been applied by the United States government. \n\"The Howard government appears to be doing the Bush administration\u2019s bidding. As far as I know, Mr Parkin has broken no Australian law. He was granted a visa to enter this country, so his arrest contradicts the government\u2019s own assessment of his credentials,\u201d \n\"It seems to have nothing to do with terrorism. The Howard Government will do whatever Washington asks of it and I am very concerned the request for his arrest came in the wake of information from Washington,\" Mr Brown said. \nThe government is currently calling for increased police powers ostensibly to protect the country from terrorists. Some groups are concerned that these powers will be used against critics of government policy. \n\"Our fears that these [Anti-terrorist] powers would be used against activists have been justified by yesterday's police action,\" said Kim Stewart.\nScott Parkin, on the day of his arrest, was due to give a workshop titled: \"Bringing Down The Pillars - People power strategies against war and capitalism\". The workshop was sponsored by Forest Action Trust, Pt'chang Nonviolence Training Project, and Friends of the Earth Melbourne.\nParkin had done guest lectures and teach-ins in the past; he has been an organizer with Houston Global Awareness, including direct action pertaining to the 2004 and 2005 protests outside the Halliburton Shareholders Meeting. He is also an active participant with Houston Indymedia despite 'outing' Maoist-themed activists by enforcing quasi-apartheid policy of noncollaboration. \nAppeal lodged.\nGreenpeace is providing legal help to Mr Parkin and advised that he had instructed his lawyers to appeal to the Migration Review Tribunal to review the basis on which his visa was withdrawn.\nDanny Kennedy, Greenpeace campaigns director, said: \"The burden of proof in the Scott Parkin expulsion case lies morally with the Commonwealth, to prove that he is a danger. When the Government brought in anti-terror legislation, they promised the public that these laws would only be used to confront a real and present risk of a terrorist attack, not a sweep-all approach against citizens.

The third Test ended in a draw (with England one wicket away from a win), and England narrowly won the fourth Test in Nottingham by three wickets after the English enforced follow on after a poor first innings by Australia.\nThe fifth and final Test started on 8 September at the Oval in London. It entered its final day evenly balanced with all results still possible and the destination of the urn still in doubt. Australia needed to win to force a 2-2 series draw and retain the Ashes; any other result would give them to England, ending 18 years and eight series of Australian dominance. In the end, England managed to bat out the final day, and a draw ensured the Ashes were coming back to England.\nKevin Pietersen and Ashley Giles hit personal bests of 158 and 59 respectively, to bat out the best part of the last day. Pieterson's 158 was his maiden test century, and included 7 sixes. Early in the day, Australia looked to be in with a chance of winning the match, with early wickets leaving England at 67 for 3. Giles and Pietersen's century partnership, though, left Australia with no hope of catching England in the remains of the day, sealing England's Ashes win since 1987.\nEngland's next Tests will be an away series in Pakistan. Meanwhile, the world champions Australia will play an ICC World XI (which inclues Kevin Pietersen, Steve Harmison and Andrew Flintoff) in the Johnnie Walker Super Series in early October. "}

Fire departments around the nation responded by sending crews to the FEMA staging ground in Atlanta. Some of these crews were unaware that they were only going to be used for public relations work. Others, however, merely hoped that FEMA would allocate them to rescue and damage control operations once it saw their qualifications.\nThe firefighter's objections are particularly poignant as one of FEMA public relations training seminars coincided with New Orleans Mayor Ray Nagin plea for firefighters on national television, to relieve his own exhausted crews. It is unclear if FEMA's request for firefighters prevented any municipalities from responding to Mayor Nagin's request.\nSome firefighters have objected to their use as FEMA public relations officers because their municipalities must bear the cost of their salaries, as well as endure reduced firefighting capacity. FEMA has stated that it sought to use firefighters to avoid background checks required of federal employees.\nFirefighters began receiving their assignments Monday, September 5th.

An overwhelming 66% are not satisfied with the current direction of the country.\nThe combination of the above issues are likely contributing to President Bush's declining approval rating.

Some Bushmen are reported to have fled into the Reserve and are evading capture.\nIn 1996 the central government of Botswana adopted a policy of evicting the Bushmen from the Central Game Reserve, an area originally set aside for them to inhabit. A constitutional amendment is also pending in Parliament to revoke the right of Bushmen to live in the Reserve in perpetuity. The government has expressed concern with several issues surrounding their continued presence in the reserve, including the need to supply them with water, the expense of educating them and providing them with health care, and their effect on the animals in the Reserve. They also say that it is in the Bushmen's best interest to join civilized society.\nCritics of the relocation, including the groups Survival International and Botswanian Centre for Human Rights, allege very different motivations. Some believe that the government is moving the Bushmen out of the region to encourage tourism and diamond mining. Others argue that the government is acting out of compassion, but is making the wrong choice; they say that the Bushmen should be left to their hunter-gatherer ways, and that attempting to integrate them into modern Botswania will destroy their identity. They also state that the resettlement camps they are placed in are in bad condition, with rampant alcoholism and prostitution.\nA court case has been in progress for three years against the government for moving them out of the Reserve, and is currently being heard. In August 2005 the United Nations urged Botswana to work with the Bushman to settle the dispute. It is estimated that some 250 Bushmen remain in the Reserve, having evaded eviction or infiltrated back after having been removed.\nAt press time, there were six days left on the government's ultimatum."}

The bulge is located 25 miles outside of the city of Bend, Ore. and three miles from the South Sister.\nThe results of this years survey won't be available for some weeks, but geologists have come to some conclusions based on the past four years of monitoring. The intial discovery was made by using information from the European Space Agency's (ESA) Interferometric Satellite Aperture Radar satellite. Scientists believe the bulge is rising at a rate of 1.4 inches per year and is due to a large lake of fluid (likely magma) that is 4.5 miles below the surface. They also think the fluid covers an area about one mile across and extends to a depth of 65 feet. The pooling fluid could be shifting magma or the creation of a new volcano. \nGround swells aren't an extraodinary occurrence in geology. Geologists suspect that these ground swellings occur in the Cascade Range and at other volcanoes, and the majority of them do not lead to eruptions. Using the same ESA satellite technology, geologists have seen lots of bulges in the Aleutian Islands that have not lead to eruptions. "}
