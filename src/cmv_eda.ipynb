I'm sure I'm not the only one but mastering everything would not be that important to me. The part of immortality that appeals most to me is being able to stick around just to see the amazing things humanity might one day achieve. \\n\\n&gt; If immortality was achieved we would have to stop having children. There we be no more new lives born into this world. Would you really want to live in a world where there can be no new life?\\n\\nWho says we have to stop having children? Sure being biologically immortal would vastly reduce the death rate, however there are still many ways that people could die such as natural disasters/murder/suicide/stupidity.\\n\\nAnd who's to say that we have to be limited to living on this world? There are already people working towards goals such as colonizing mars. Now just imagine if you give these people thousands of years to focus on their work. I don't think it's too far fetched to imagine that we could eventually colonize multiple different planets, thus creating a need for more people to be born.\""

      "text/markdown": "> **CMV: Males and Females are socially and emotionally incompatible and heterosexual relationships are unrealistic and farcical.** \n>  \n>  Hi CMV! \n> \n> I am of the belief that there cannot exist a legitimate emotional bond between a male and a female that lead to a loving relationship (that is - one of romance). Not once have I seen a couple that did not have an enormous gap in interests, composure, speech patterns, and emotional engagement. There's always and awkward disparity between each partner, and they seem to be tolerating each other, whilst there is little to grasp on why they are interested in each other aside from basic biology. \n> \n> As a result of this, homosexual relationships have always seemed purely the logical and socially optimal choice for anyone pursuing a relationship, and heterosexual relationships continue only because of a heteronormitive society and the biology of reproduction (which I believe is immoral, but that's another topic). I may be biased, but from my perspective and experience I've simply never seen a straight couple that was legitimately compatible in most ways. \n>  \n>  **Counter** \n>  \n>  &gt; Not once have I seen a couple that did not have an enormous gap in interests\n> \n> For what it's worth, there are two large biases here with you need to contend with.\n> \n> 1. The couples which you know and see will be influenced heavily with who you associate with and is not representative of relationships in general or the potential which some relationships can reach\n> \n> 2. This also depends heavily upon your judgment of those relationships. Which has the following problems \n> \n>   * You might not have complete indepth knowledge between the dynamics of these couples\n> \n>   * Even if you did, you might midjudge aspects of a relationship. Do you know exactly what the other person needs or is looking for? Do you know what elements create successful relationships? Can you judge those correctly 100% of the time?\n> \n> Also,\n> \n> &gt; and heterosexual relationships continue only because of a heteronormitive society and the biology of reproduction \n> \n> What about relationships which last past this stage? This statement obviously doesn't hold up either.\n> \n> &gt; I may be biased, but from my perspective and experience I've simply never seen a straight couple that was legitimately compatible in most ways.\n> \n> That's basically your argument \"i've never seen it work before therefore it cant work\". It's not a very good position to defend because, as you've already awknowledged, its covered in bias which prevents it from being logically valid.\n> \n> \n> \n> ___\n> \n> I'm personally in a working relationship and the differences between thinking which come from being different sexes is quite apparent, that doesn't mean we cant work with it though.\n> \n> &gt;they seem to be tolerating each other\n> \n> Yes, there's a lot of that in a relationship. After all of the love hormones wear off after a couple of years there is an element of toleration since your partners flaws begin to show and you become to get to know them. The point is though that we're also able to accept each others flaws and let on with our lives despite them.\n> \n> The reason why we can ignore them is because more of the time we are supportive of each other. We communicate openly and honestly and we are good listeners. We enjoy each others company much more often than not. We also accept that if the other falls short for some reason that they are only human and that's to be expected."

I am not sure this is a good idea. I am all for life extension if possible. Living to or even a years like the Asari from the video game Mass Effect would be a good thing.But immortality would be more hell than a good thing. If one is immortal then you have all the time in the world to do things. But eventually I think you will run out of things to do. It could be a years or maybe in but eventually you will have mastered everything and no longer have anything left to do with your life.What if your loved ones somehow die because someone killed them and thus immortality didnt help them? Would you really want to live forever after that?Some would argue that death pushes us forward to do things because we know we have a time limit. Im not so sure of this argument myself. I enjoy life and go to do things not because I have a time limit but because I enjoy doing these things. Nevertheless it is an argument that some has brought up.If immortality was achieved we would have to stop having children. There we be no more new lives born into this world. Would you really want to live in a world where there can be no new life?And finally if immortality was possible do you really think you or I would get it? No the rich and powerful will have access to it. Hitlers year Reich may very well be a possibility. If the rich and dictators achieve immortality then we would be crush under their boots. Anyone ever seen the movie In Time? It would be a lot like that.I think we should extend our lifespans if it is even possible but immortality should be out of the question. Nobody should live forever. \n>  \n>  **Counter** \n>  \n>  If you get to the point that you feel there is literally nothing else to do with your life what is stopping you from ending it through means such as assisted suicide? Im sure Im not the only one but mastering everything would not be that important to me. The part of immortality that appeals most to me is being able to stick around just to see the amazing things humanity might one day achieve. Who says we have to stop having children? Sure being biologically immortal would vastly reduce the death rate however there are still many ways that people could die such as natural disastersmurdersuicidestupidity.And whos to say that we have to be limited to living on this world? There are already people working towards goals such as colonizing mars. Now just imagine if you give these people thousands of years to focus on their work. I dont think its too far fetched to imagine that we could eventually colonize multiple different planets thus creating a need for more people to be born."
