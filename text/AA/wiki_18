The U.N. hopes the meeting will conclude with a road map toward a new agreement on reducing the types of air pollution many scientists believe are driving changes in the earth's climate.\nThe Bali meeting aims to get countries to commit to working out a new agreement on emissions cuts to extend or replace the Kyoto Protocol, which expires in 2012. Conference president Rachmat Witoelar of Indonesia told reporters that a detailed proposal is not necessary at this stage, but participation by all nations is vital.\n\"We will be happy if this Bali road map is general so we will not push for a very detailed in this short time,\" he said. \"The introduction, the process is important.\"\nAs the conference opened, Australia's new prime minister, Kevin Rudd, signed the Kyoto Protocol, limiting his country's greenhouse gas emissions. That act earned a standing ovation in Bali, and focused attention on the failure of the United States to sign the protocol - the only developed nation not to have done so.\n\"While the current U.S. delegation will not join in serious negotiations over mandatory limits on global warming pollution, they won't be around when the final deal is made in 2009. A new team will be on the field with a very different game plan,\" he said. \"The other nations must not allow the U.S. to derail, delay or water down the Bali mandate.\"\nSenior U.S. negotiator Harlan Watson denied his country was blocking progress, saying the U.S. had merely chosen a different course.\n\"It's up to each country to do the analysis and analyze for themselves if the target is do-able. Obviously the U.S. came to a different conclusion,\" he said. \"We respect the decisions other countries have made and of course ask them to respect the decision that we've made.\"\nPresident Bush says that the Kyoto Protocol threatened U.S. economic growth, and believes that any future climate-change agreement will be ineffective unless it includes rapidly developing nations such as China and India, which are among the world's largest producers of greenhouse gases.\nOther subjects on the agenda in Bali include saving the world's remaining forests, and sharing technologies to help developing nations grow in less-polluting ways. The U.N. also hopes to finalize a fund to help countries affected by global warming to cope with the impacts. The money could go toward flood-proof houses, better water management, and crop diversification.\nThe Bali conference will continue until December 14. Thousands of government representatives, scientists and activists are attending."}

The NExBTL facility will be Neste's third such project, and is intended to have a maximum capacity of 800,000 tonnes a year.\nDemand for biofuels is expected to rise greatly over the next few years, as they are often cited as a good way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and are viewed as a renewable alternative to crude oil which has been at record high prices in recent months.\nThe site has been strategically selected to be close to Malaysia and Indonesia, both of whom are leading world suppliers of palm oil, which is intended to be the main fuel for the plant. Between them they account for 80% of global production. However, the use of palm oil is controversial, as some environmental scientists and campaigners believe using it will have a negative effect as increased demand in turn causes higher food prices and greater levels of deforestation.\nEarlier this year, Greenpeace attempted to stop a palm oil tanker ship destined to Neste's existing biodiesel plant in Porvoo, Finland, but failed to stop the delivery. In addition to the Porvoo plant, which began operations earlier this year and is at its capacity production of 170,000 tonnes, Neste plan a second plant to open in 2009.\nThe new plant will increase demand for palm oil, as it will require 200,000 hectares of palm oil plantations to supply the million tonnes of oil it requires per annum. \"The new plantations are to be set up mainly in Indonesia, and increasingly in swamp rain forests,\" said Greenpeace's Lauri Myllyvirta. When such terrain is cleared of trees, the peaty soil begins to dry out. \"In the years that follow, it releases all of the carbon that had been stored in it\", Myllyvirta continues. He concludes that he believes palm oil cultivated in such conditions produces ten times the carbon dioxide emissions of fossil fuels. Jarmo Honkamaa, director of Neste's biofuel sector, countered these claims with his belief that the gas balance remains positive and points to Neste statistics which say biodiesel diesel produces 40-60% less greenhouse gas emissions than standard diesel.\nAnother potential problem has been highlighted by Citigroup, who voiced concerns that Neste may not be able to complete the project on time and within the intended budget. Recently, Neste added a standard diesel production line at their Porvoo refinery. This was finished this year, approximately one year late and at an actual cost of \u20ac750 million, versus a budget of \u20ac500 million. Neste CEO Risto Rinne said in response, \"we have learned our lesson,\" regarding the miscalculations on the new facility, and said that this knowledge, coupled with that obtained during construction of the Porvoo biodiesel plant, had been factored into calculations regarding the Singapore plant.\nConstruction on the third facility will start early next year, and is scheduled to end in 2010. Neste said in a statement that the investment was \"part of Neste Oil's strategic goal of becoming the world's leading renewable diesel producer.\""}

The latest documents they have received are the details of the 2004 copy of the manual signed off by Major General Geoffrey D. Miller of the U.S. . This is following on from the earlier leaking of the 2003 version. Wikileaks passed this document to people they consider experts in the field to carry out an analysis trying to validate it. Following this, they set out to assess what had changed between 2003 and 2004; including attempts to link publicly known incidents with changes to the manual. \nWikinews obtained the document and did an in-depth analysis. The American Civil Liberties Union had previously made a request to view and obtain copies of the same document, but was denied access to them.\nOne of the first notable changes to the document relates to the detainees themselves. Previously they read the camp rules during admission processing. Rules are now posted around the camp in detainees' languages. The English version of the rules is as follows:\nOf concern to groups such as Amnesty International who campaign for the camp's closure, or Human Rights Watch concerned about prisoner handling under the prisoner of war aspects of the , is the fact that policy for newly admitted detainees still allows for up to 4 weeks where access to the detainee by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) may be denied. In addition, guards are not to allow ICRC staff to pass mail to detainees.\nA new process has been formed which allows guards to determine whether or not a detainee receives awards, or is punished. The form is called a \"GTMO Form 508-1 ( to the right)\". According to the manual, the form \"is used to determine which rewards the detainee will lose or gain,\" but \"special rewards\" can also be earned, outside of the process. One special reward is time allowed outside. Another special reward is a roll of toilet paper, but the detainee cannot share it with others. Doing so will result in \"punishment\" and confiscation of the roll. If the detainee already has a roll of toilet paper, he is not allowed to have another.\n\"Guards need to ensure that the detainee doesn't receive additional toilet paper when the detainee already has it. The amount given to the detainee will be the same amount as normally distributed to the detainee,\" states the manual.\nNo matter how bad a detainee may act, \"haircuts will never be used as punitive action\" against them, but they can have hair removed for health reasons. They can, however, be segregated from other detainees.\n\"If a detainee has committed an offense that requires segregation time, even if a segregation cell is not available, the detainee will receive a shave and a haircut for hygiene and medical reasons. If the detainee is IRFed, the haircut and shave will follow the decontamination process,\" adds the manual. Barbers are also part of cell searches.\nDespite these changes, a great deal of effort has gone into ensuring the furore over detainee abuse does not recur. Rules governing the use of pepper spray (Oleoresin Capsicum, or OC) appear at an earlier point in the manual with considerable expansion. Infractions such as spitting, throwing water at, or attempting to urinate on guards appear as explicitly listed cases where pepper spray may not be used. Extensive decontamination procedures are included in the document, including immediately calling for a medical check on any detainee exposed to pepper spray. This was not previously present.\nAs a counter to the clearer instructions on use of pepper spray, Wikileaks asserts that many of the stricter rules for guards (referred to as Military Police or MPs in the 2003 manual) aim to reduce fraternisation that may improve detainee morale and adversely influence any interrogation process. Guards are informed in the manual not to take personal mail and parcels within the detention blocks or at any other duty stations. All electronic devices except issued materiel are prohibited, and guards may face disciplinary action should they keep detainees apprised of current affairs or discuss issues in their personal lives.\nAdditional restrictions on the detainees' chaplain are included in the revised document. Wikileaks speculated that many of these changes might have stemmed from the widely publicised case of . Captain Yee, a graduate, served at the Guantanamo Bay base as a chaplain to the detainees and received two Distinguished Service medals for his work. Following discovery of a list of detainees and interrogators by U.S. Customs in Florida Yee was charged with , aiding the enemy, spying, espionage, and failure to obey a general order. Eventually all charges were dropped with national security concerns being raised should evidence be released.\nThe most notable changes surrounding the role of the chaplain include its removal as a permanent position on the facility's Library Working group and its exclusion from the decision process on appropriate detainee reading material. Wikileaks contacted lawyers representing detainees in the camp to perform their own analysis. Their opinion of the changes were that the library operation had been considerably tightened up. Duplicate books are required for the individual four camps to prevent covert use of books to communicate between camps. Periodicals, dictionaries, language instruction books, technology or medical update information, and geography were additions to the prohibited material. Instructions indicate such books must be returned to the source or donor.\nThe revised SOP manual makes considerable progress on documenting procedures, even those that are remote possibilities. A lengthy addition details rules to follow in the event of an escape or escape attempt. Laced throughout this procedure is an emphasis on having any such incident fully documented and - wherever possible - filmed. The procedure is explicit in how to recapture an escaped detainee with minimal use of force. One additional procedure covers the admission of ambulances to the main base area. A detailed security protocol to ensure only expected and authorised traffic gains access is included, as is a procedure streamlined to ensure the ambulance arrives on the scene as quickly as possible.\nUnchanged from the 2003 manual is the set menu of four ready-to-eat meals ( or MRE) issued to detainees. However, additional steps are to be taken for \"MRE Sanitization\"; supply personnel must remove anything that can damage waste disposal systems\u2014 presumably a military term for toilets. Under normal camp conditions, detainees should be fed hot meals as opposed to MREs, but no details on the variety of menu are included.\nWikinews attempted to get feedback on this. US Southern Command passed a query on to Rick Haupt (Commander, U.S. Navy Director of Public Affairs, Joint Task Force at Guantanamo) who responded that \"questions were forwarded along with a request to authenticate the leaked document; a response is pending.\" At this time no response to emails has been received from the ICRC or Human Rights Watch.\n has requested that the document be removed from Wikileaks because \"information with the FOUO (For Official Use Only) label is not approved for release to the public.\" They then state that the document can be \"made available through a Freedom Of Information Act request through official channels.\""}

She played Rachel Cory, the maven of \"Another World's\" fictional town, Bay City, from 1972 to 1999 when the show went off the air. Wyndham talks about how she was seen as the anchor of a show, and the political infighting to keep it on the air as NBC wanted to wrest control of the long-running soap from Procter &amp; Gamble. Wyndham fought to keep it on the air, but eventually succumbed to the inevitable. She discusses life on the soap opera, and the seven years she spent wandering \"in the woods\" of Los Angeles seeking direction, now divorced from a character who had come to define her professional career. Happy, healthy and with a family she is proud of, Wyndham has found life after the death of \"Another World\" in painting and animals. Below is 's interview with the soap diva.\nCareer and motherhood.\nHow are you doing?\nYou look great. You look amazing.\nHow\u2019s the sculpture?\nBoth of your sons have gone on to creative careers. Christian Camargo is an actor, and the other is a photographer?\nWhen your sons decided that they wanted to pursue careers that were not so assured in income, like a lawyer or a doctor, but more something that is a creative enterprise like a photographer or an actor \u2026\nAs any mother would\u2026\nHow has it been since you left \u2018Another World?\u2019 \nThat\u2019s after \u2018Another World\u2019?\nAnywhere. It doesn\u2019t matter what it is. \nUnrefined talent.\nAwesome. That\u2019s big.\nThey must get a kick out of that though. \nThe politics behind the demise of Another World.\nWhen you\u2019re known so well for one particular role--Rachel Cory in Another World--yet you are multi-dimensional, how do you handle the frustration that must breed inside yourself?\nBut it doesn\u2019t bother you to just be recognized for one role?\nYou weren\u2019t particularly happy with that story line though. At first you didn\u2019t mind, but then after \u2026\nWhy?\nAnd you were one of the main draws on the show? So if they got rid of you \u2026. \nWhy did they not want the show anymore?\n\"'Flopped, like \"Passions\" did. They were throwing midgets out there--\nHow do you not let that go to your head? How do you keep calm after something like that?\nIt\u2019s tenuous, like a tooth hanging by a thread.\nNBC wanted all the profits.\nWyndham's efforts to save Another World.\nIs that the soap opera model, that there needs to be certain character anchors--like a Susan Lucci--on the show that exist and then they can kind of shuffle up the newer characters? \nAlthough it\u2019s a different idea because a soap is daily and you have people who watch it as if it\u2019s a part of their lives opposed to a weekly drama. I mean, you were twenty-five years on \u2019Another World\u2019 \u2026.\nWhat was the updated version of soap operas that you envisioned?\nThey would turn to you for ideas?\nAnd you also knew history.\nI read that they didn\u2019t care about the history and the traditions in Another World?\n\u201cShe\u2019ll never be able to play that off. He\u2019ll be able to\u2026..\u201d That kind of stuff?\nDo you still keep in touch with a lot of the people from the show?\nIsn\u2019t that odd?\nDo you find that that\u2019s true in almost every friendship situation though?\nThat there\u2019s a need for commonality \u2026..?\nThey all move on to the next thing.\nWhat was that?\nWhat\u2019s the fourth wall?\nIs that typical?\nThe future of soap operas.\nWhere do you think soaps are going to go now?\nWould you go back to one?\nBut twenty-five years on a soap. It\u2019s so funny to hear you say you weren\u2019t interested. I understand you had your children. It was a good gig, steady income. It kept you on the east coast. \nIf you\u2019re going to do something, do it well.\nWhy do they not want to change?\nWhere else do you see that in the culture?\nOr Showtime.\nYou saw that with The Sopranos and Six Feet Under.\nPay some writers.\nHow does someone become a soap actor? Is it something they fall into or is it something that is pursued?\nAnd the emotion that goes with live performance.\nReally? Is it more of a function of modernity or more of a function of youth that they\u2018re like that?\nWyndham's career and making it as a creative.\nYou\u2019ve never wanted to do a film?\nAre you turning down projects now?\nYou\u2019re not at that point anymore where you need to work. \nEvery actor\u2019s worry.\nWhy haven\u2019t you gone more toward the writing.\nHave you ever tried to use a pseudonym?\nJust for fun you should do it, just as an experiment. Change your name and send it. Be like, \u201cHi, I\u2019m a young intrepid writer and I have this script.\u201d Not just a soap opera actress.\nBut the difference is what they say and what they do. Show business is known as such a vicious industry. \nTo your face. \nBut isn\u2019t that even more disenchanting when someone is like, \u201cYou\u2019re the best. You\u2019re so great.\u201d And the next thing you know is, \u201cThat person thinks you suck.\u201d And your like, \u201cWe just had this great meeting. I thought that they loved me.\u201d\nHow do you persevere? Even when you were younger and not in the comfortable place you are now?\nAside from good acting, what was the secret to your longevity? It\u2019s not just good acting that gets you staying around that long. \nOr Norman Mailer \u2026\nTelevision's lust for youth.\nAre you putting yourself out there for roles?\nDo you think that that model where you have 23-year-olds playing 18-year-olds and you have 23-year-olds playing 30-year-olds is getting old? Don\u2019t you think people are getting sick of seeing just \u2026\nYeah. Don\u2019t you think it\u2019s at the point where it\u2019s becoming a farce? Is that really what people want?\nI understand the WB and UPN Networks that 16-year-olds want to watch people who look like they\u2019re 16.\nThat\u2019s only a small portion of the populace. \nSome realistic depictions of life or interesting stories that are well written, but not all played by people who are 22.\nCould people transcend that? I was watching The Sopranos last night and Lauren Bacall was on it and I was transfixed watching her. Is it more because it\u2019s Lauren Bacall or is it more so just cause it\u2019s just interesting? Remember like the mother on that show \u2026.\nSo it\u2019s laziness that\u2019s giving us all of this all of this, \u201cOh just throw on a smooth skin and thus we don\u2019t have to worry about the writing as much. We don\u2019t have to worry about whether the story is engaging.\u201d\nWhich Showtime repeated.\nBut they\u2019ve got fat people. They\u2019ve got short people. They\u2019ve got nerds.\nNormal people. And that was wildly popular.\nIt\u2019s self defeating because in the end people stop watching.\nWhy is it so difficult to see?\nWhere do you think the disconnect is? Do you think it\u2019s a disconnect between people who don\u2019t know their product that they have on the air, like you have executives who really don\u2019t follow it and it is what it is and stick with it?\nIt\u2019s the teenagers who come home from school \nHer relationship today to the character Rachel Cory.\nDo you still get mobbed on the streets when you walk?\nHow does that feel? Is it strange for you, because you probably were accustomed to that for so long?\nTo just walk into Saks and shop and not have it.\nIs it annoying to talk about Rachel Cory still?\nWere there certain writers who you just had it out with and you were like, \u2018This is just not going to go?\u2019\nIs there any that stand out that you\u2018d want to name?\nThey were that bad? You remember the good ones, but not the bad ones? \nMatriarch.\nWhat would be one story line that really stands out to you that you were like, \u201cwhy didn\u2019t we explore this more? This was an important issue.\u201d\nWyndham on a higher power and the creative process.\nDo you believe in a higher power?\nWhat is that higher power?\nDo you go to church?\nDo you pray?\nDaily?\nIt\u2019s when you feel moved?\nWhy do you think it\u2019s difficult for people to pull instinct out from inside themselves and actually use it? As an actor, as an artist on any level, you have to? It\u2019s almost like this little well inside yourself that when you get those little goose bumps and say, \u2019Oh, this is good.\u2019\nYou have to go with it. But there\u2019s a lot of people who, even if they have that feeling they talk themselves down from it. \u201cOh, this is actually crap. Oh, this is bad. Oh, this is stupid.\u201d\nHow do you hold on to that feeling without talking yourself down from it?\nIn what way?\nIt took the art out of it?\nAfter AW: Wyndham lost in California.\nIt must get tiresome to constantly need to educate a new person every time, especially if they didn\u2018t get it and you\u2019re like, \u2018No, that\u2019s not what I was saying. This was what I was saying. You misunderstood.\u2019\nThe kids were grown up and you didn\u2019t have to be back here anymore so you tried California?\nBut don\u2019t you feel better for having done it and knowing as opposed to always wondering?\nWyndham discovers painting.\nHow did you get out of that wilderness?\nThat was seven years? Seven years in Tibet?\nWhat\u2019s his name?\nHow did you meet him?\nL.A. is a mess, and you always get stuck in traffic.\nSo the class that you were in was not interesting, but you went to another class?\nThe gooseflesh.\nWhat did it end up doing for you?\nWhat did you do with that experience? You came back to the east coast?\nAnd there\u2019s nothing you can do about it?\nCharles Keating?\nAnd that pulled you out of this funk?\nWhen did you decide to leave and come back?\nWhat was that panic?\nI\u2019m not getting calls.\nWas that hard being divorced from that character?\nHow is the inspiration for the art different from the inspiration you would draw for characters?\nTotally different worlds. \nWhat is it that you\u2019re saying now in your art?\nWyndham on the state of the world.\nIf you could choose the way you die, how would you choose?\nAnd if there is a God, and you went up there, what do you think God would say to you?\nBut say it\u2019s true.\nAnd do you think He would? Or she?\nIt\u2019s true. Has the Iraq war affected you? \nHow so?\nDo you think the country has changed?\nI got into an argument when I was in law school. My professor came out against this really famous opinion which was almost what our entire notions of free speech are called California v. Whitney. It was written by this very famous justice about a hundred years ago named Brandeis.\nYeah. And he said in my class and I\u2014something that law students don\u2019t do; I didn\u2019t fit in very well there\u2014I took him on in the middle of 120 students and said, \u201cI can\u2019t believe you would say that he would not write that opinion today.\u201d And he said, \u2018Everything\u2019s changed. It is thinking like yours that is why we discuss torture.\u201d\nOh he said that we have religious extremism now. We can\u2019t tell who are our enemies. We have all these new things. And I said, \u2018All of these things have existed in the past just because they are wrapped up in a different package or it\u2019s a new mixture of ingredients doesn\u2019t change them. In Vietnam we had people who were disguised as regular Vietnamese, driving our jeeps and blowing up our bases. That\u2019s not anything different than what we have now. I said we had the first World Trade Center attack where that happened. That\u2019s not a reason to all of a sudden start questioning our free speech rights just because it\u2019s dressed up in a different package.\nWorld War I, IRA. That was Protestant versus Catholic regligious extremism. The UK had that. Just because we as Americans haven\u2019t seen a certain kind of thing before doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s new.\nIt\u2019s amazing that we debate these things now."}

Both the declaration of the new Agenda item, as well as the setting up of the Contact group, came after lengthy discussions that were polarized between the Group of 77 + China (G77+C), which is comprised of about 130 nations with developing industries, and the Umbrella group, which consists of most of the nations with highly industrialized economies, but the EU countries. . \nThe sub-body, called the Subsidiary Body for Implementation (SBI) is, as its name implies, amongst other things responsible for preparing and implementing decisions of the main body of the UNFCCC, the Conference of the Parties (COP). After having spent a large part of the morning discussing formalities regarding whether or not technology transfer was to be taken up as a separate item, the afternoon session had to be extended till around 9 pm local time. Even then some of the planned agenda items had not been concluded when the session closed.\nThe cause for discussion in the morning were two different interpretations of a decision the COP made yesterday: Member states of the G77+C believed that the referral of the item of tech transfer by the COP automatically lead to its inclusion on the agenda as a separate item, while the Chairman of the SBI and the US voiced the opinion that to for it to be included, the item would have to be formally agreed upon in the normal manner. Compromise, of one sort or another, could not be reached, and it was only after a legal adviser stated that in his point of view the item indeed was necessarily included on the agenda as a separate item that the matter could be concluded.\nDue to the stalling in the mornings session, discussions on the actual item of technology transfer began after what would have been the scheduled closing time. South Africa made the proposal to set up a contact group for the item, so that it could be discussed in a setting with less participants in an informal way. A number of G77+C nations (including China and Nigeria) spoke out in support of this proposal, emphasizing that rapid progress was needed on the issue. Japan, and the US made critical statements, noting that they believed that the scope of the contact group should first be established, and that it would be more sensible to establish the contact group in 2008. After it was found that the group would nevertheless be established, the Chairman asked for suggestions for Co-chairs of the group, as one from the Annex I and one from the non Annex one would be required. The non-Annex I having already decided that they supported Prof. Philip M. Gwage from Uganda as Co-chair, the Annex I countries decided that Jukka Uosukainen from Finland would be the Co-chair on their behalf after brief deliberations. The decision being reached provoked some applause from delegates and observers, and the session was closed shortly thereafter."}

The House of Representatives has approved US$50 billion of that. But in the Senate, Republican blocked a similar funding package last month because it included a timetable for a troop withdrawal.\nSenate Majority Leader Harry Reid, a Nevada Democrat, said the failure of the Senate to approve the war funding should not be blamed on the Democrats.\n\"If not for the stubborn refusal of the president and his Republicans enablers to work with us, we would have accomplished a lot more,\" said Senator Reid.\nAlthough Mr. Bush had warned that the Pentagon would be forced to begin laying off civilian employees if the funds are not received soon, Senator Reid said the Pentagon could shift funds for the war effort from other accounts.\nBesides funding for the war, Congress must also pass legislation funding government agencies and programs. In addition, lawmakers may also try to revise a wiretapping law that expires in two months."}

At the United Nations Conference on Climate Change in Bali, the group argued developed countries should pay to address the problem, and costs could top $50 billion a year. \nClimate change, which many scientists believe is fuelled by human activities, alters rain cycles and causes increased droughts and flooding. Rising temperatures mean some traditional crops do not grow as well as they used to. The United Nations predicts that in some African countries, crop yields could fall by half.\nOxfam researcher Kate Raworth says coping with these issues will be expensive.\n\"Oxfam has estimated that for all developing countries to adapt to climate change will cost at least $50 billion a year,\" she said. \"And for that to be done with justice we believe that the rich and the most polluting countries should pay the vast share of the money to make possible for those countries most vulnerable and least responsible for causing the problem to cope with the new realities they have to deal with.\"\nThe report released by Oxfam at the conference on Tuesday says some countries are already feeling the effects of a warming planet. In South Africa, farmers are planting faster-maturing crops to adapt to unpredictable rainfall.\nBangladeshis are creating floating vegetable gardens that can thrive in spite of floods.

It also aims to begin deciding how to divide those resources between prevention of further climate change, and adaptation to the changes that are already taking place.\nThe conference involves thousands of scientists, government officials and development group representatives, and runs for another 10 days."}

It was a follow-up to a March 2007 hearing.\nSubcommittee Chairman Carl Levin said in his opening statement: \"Today's focus is on credit card issuers who hike the interest rates of cardholders who play by the rules \u2014 meaning those folks who pay on time, pay at least the minimum amount due, and wake up one day to find their interest rate has gone through the roof \u2014 again, not because they paid late or exceeded the credit limit, but because their credit card issuer decided they should be 'repriced'.\"\nPresent to testify on behalf of credit card issuers were Roger C. Hochschild of Discover Financial Services, Bruce L. Hammonds of Bank of America Corporation, and Ryan Schneider of Capital One Financial Corporation.\nMuch of the 90 minute hearing focused on specific cases where interest rates were raised, allegedly because credit scores of the debtor dropped, and not because they were delinquent or otherwise behind on payments. According to Levin, this practice made it so that almost all payments went towards finance charges with almost none toward repaying the principal. This, he felt, is an unfair practice, as the credit card companies were negligent in informing their customers of the rate hikes and the reason for such hikes.\nThe collective credit card debt of Americans totals an estimated US$900 billion. Issuers have come under pressure to disclose their policies in regards to setting fees and interest rates. The US Truth in Lending Act requires that terms of a loan be set forth up front. Fluctuating interest rates on credit cards would, on the surface, appear to violate this act.\nRoger C. Hochschild disagreed, arguing that \"every card transaction is a new extension of credit ... This makes it difficult \u2014 and risky \u2014 to underwrite, and price, the loan based solely on the borrower's credit-worthiness at the time of application [for the card].\"\nRyan Schneider, agreed: \"The ability to modify the terms of a credit card agreement to accommodate changes over time to the economy or the credit-worthiness of consumers must be preserved.\"\n\"Attempts to interfere with the market here ... will inevitably result in less credit being offered,\" warned Bruce Hammonds. \"Risk-based pricing has democratized access to credit,\" he added.\nAll three credit card executives also mentioned an ongoing Federal Reserve System review of credit card rules that already proposes a 45-day notification ahead of any rate changes.\nCommittee members criticized the industry for varying practices. Included in the criticism was the practice of mailing checks to card-holders, failing to notify applicants that obtaining additional cards could lower their credit score and raise their rates, and \"ambushing\" card-holders with raised rates.\nRanking minority member of the subcommittee, Norm Coleman said, \"families find themselves ensnared in a seemingly inescapable web of credit card debt. They particularly report being saddled with interest rates that skyrocketed on them seemingly out of the blue.\""}

Since acrylamide forms naturally in a wide variety of cooked foods, it is not possible to have a healthy, balanced diet that avoids it,\" said a Food Standards Agency spokesperson.\nAccording to the study, acrylamides, a chemical produced when cooking foods high in carbohydrates over 120 degrees Celsius (248 degrees Fahrenheit) in the frying, toasting and grilling processes, is a likely cause of some womb and ovarian cancers. Although it was found in 2002 that the chemical may be a cause of some cancers, the new study shows, for the first time, a link between the chemical in a human diet being a cause. To date, there is no evidence to suggest the chemical may cause breast cancer.\nScientists followed and monitored 120,000 people over an 11-year-period, of whom 62,000 were women. Of the women, 300 ended up contracting ovarian cancer with 327 contracting womb cancer.\nThe study concluded that more than 40 micrograms of the chemical, or one bag of potato chips per day, is twice as likely to cause cancer in women. \n\"General advice, resulting from this project, is to avoid overcooking when baking, frying or toasting carbohydrate-rich foods,\" said a spokesman for the European Union."}

European states are pushing for steep reductions in emissions, but environmentalists accuse some others of dragging their feet. \nThe European Union's climate chief, Artur Runge Metzger, says his organization wants greenhouse emissions cut by half by the middle of the century.\n\"We would like to see global average temperatures rise no more than an average of two degrees compared to pre-industrial levels,\" Metzger said. \"And that would require that global emissions go down by at least 50 percent of the 1990 emissions by the year 2050.\"\nGreenhouse emissions are thought to be causing global warming. Metzger downplayed differences between the EU and other countries on reduction targets, saying he believes the response to the 50 percent proposal has been increasingly positive. He noted that Japan, Canada and some members of the U.S. congress have expressed support for the idea.\nThose same countries, however, have been targeted by environmental groups, who say they have failed in their initial statements here to come out strongly enough for significant cuts. Hans Verolme of the group WWF says Japan is being criticized for not including binding targets in its proposal for emission control discussions.\n\"That in our view would be quite disastrous. It would delay action and it would in fact lead to dangerous climate change,\" Verolme said.\nJapan says its proposal is merely an attempt to get the conversation started, and U.N. climate change chief Yvo de Boer has also sought to downplay any differences. De Boer repeatedly points out that the Bali conference is not meant to produce a new climate-change treaty to replace the Kyoto Protocol. That 1997 agreement is set to expire in 2012.\n\"This meeting in Bali will not finalize a post-2012 climate change deal, that's much too complicated to do in 10 days, but what it can do is put in place a two-year process to work towards such a deal,\" De Boer said.\nEven the two-degree temperature rise that the European Union talks about is predicted to have serious effects on humans and the environment.

The competition, which along with the Intel Competition are one of the two most prestigious competitions for high school science research in the United States. The Siemens Competition has two competitions, one for individual research and the other for team research. For the first time in history both the individual and team awards were won by women. \nJanelle Schlossberger and Amanda Marinoff, students at Plainview-Old Bethpage John F. Kennedy High School in Plainview, New York won the team section of the competition for their work developing a drug that blocks reproduction of tuberculosis bacteria. Meanwhile, Isha Himani Jain from Freedom High School in Pennsylvania won the individual competition for work involving the bone growth in Zebra fish. Schlossberger and Marinoff will split a $100,000 prize and Himani Jain will also receive a $100,000 prize. Various other students will also receive smaller awards. Many of the other higher-level awards also went to women this year. \nThe success of the young ladies was of particular note because historically women have been underrepresented in math and science. The lack of representation has been a matter of heavy political dispute and figured into the departure of Larry Summers as president of Harvard after he speculated that the lack of representation might be due to innate biological differences. The proportion of scientists who are female has been steadily increasing over the last 50 years. According to James Whaley, the president of the Siemens Foundation, there has been a steady increase in the proportion of students entering the competition who are female and this year 48% of the students entering were female. Many commentators have called the results a sign that the gap between males and females in the sciences is closing or has closed. However, other commentators have said that females will only have reached equality with males in science was when triumphs such as this one are so routine as to not merit headlines.\nThe Siemens-Westinghouse Competition, now known as the Siemens Competition, was founded in 1998 after Siemens acquired Westinghouse but failed to acquire the rights to the Westinghouse competition which instead went to Intel and was renamed the Intel Science Talent Search.\nExternal link.\n "}

These are twofold, one regarding the current Conference, and one future goals. On the talks here at Bali, the Declaration says it is necessary that \"a new global climate treaty [...] needs to begin in December 2007 and be completed by 2009\". It went on to say that \"The primary goal of this new regime must be to limit global warming to no more than 2 \u00b0C\", and that emissions would need to be cut to 40% or less than 2004 levels in order to be able to reach that goal.\nAsked by which means these reductions could be achieved, Professor Richard Somerville from the United States answered that only a combination of technological advances and lifestyle changes would be sufficient to attain the proposed emission levels. \nThe declaration, which is only about a page long, and its signatory list can be found at the Climate Change Research Centre's website (see below)."}

They argue the measure does not ensure that other nations, particularly China and India, will cut emissions.\n\"China's emission will continue to accelerate as it builds coal plants and imports jobs from the United States. This will be enormously expensive to households within seven years as electricity prices skyrocket by 35 to 65 percent,\" said Senator James Inhofe of Oklahoma, the top Republican on the committee.\nBut co-sponsor Republican Senator John Warner of Virginia, who broke with many in his party to support the measure, offered a different view: \"If we do not act, China and India will hide behind America's skirts of inaction and take no steps of their own.

The German foundation, named in his honor, announced today, Stockhausen passed away in his K\u00fcrten home in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany.\nA prolific composer, he wrote more than 300 works during his career, establishing himself as a pioneer of electronic music, as well as a representative of serialism. \"Studie I\", dated 1953, is considered one of the first electronic music works ever produced. \nBorn in M\u00f6drath, Germany, in 1927, he was the son of a mother from a wealthy family and a father who was a teacher. He grew up in Altenberg, where he started taking piano lessons. He studied piano and music pedagogy at the \"Musikhochschule\" in Cologne. It was at University of Cologne, he later studied musicology, philosophy and Germanics.\nHe was influenced by musicians such as Oliver Messiaen, Edgard Var\u00e8se, and Anton Webern, but also by painters such as Piet Mondrian and Paul Klee. Stockhausen's works often departed from usual music styles.\nDuring his life as a musician, Stockhausen explored most of the genres and styles. Starting in punctualism and concrete music early in his career, during the 1950s, he proceeded to research the electronic music area, which at the time was in an embryonic state. In the 1960s, he composed works of choral music, putting side-by-side the chorus and the use of electronic facilities. In the 1970s, he dedicated himself to serialism. Between 1977 and 2003, he committed himself to one of his most ambitious projects: a cycle of thematic works named \"Licht: Die sieben Tage der Woche\" (\"Light: the Seven Days of the Week\").\nVarious artists have stated that they were influenced by Stokhausen, including artists as varied as Frank Zappa, Bj\u00f6rk, Miles Davis, as well as Roger Waters and Rick Wright\u2014two of the Pink Floyd members. The Beatles included a portrait of Stockhausen among the people pictured on the cover of their album \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\". Italian singer/songwriter Franco Battiato dedicated \"Sulle corde di Aries\" to the composer. \nWhile being a controversial artist, Stockhausen became a focus of polemics after he stated that the September 11, 2001 attacks were \"works of art\". He later explained the meaning of his statements, and said that they had been, according to him, out-of-context and misquoted."}

There is a law against it,\" said Senator of Michigan, the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee.\nAt the White House, spokeswoman said President Bush only learned of the matter two days ago, after he was briefed by CIA Director Hayden.\n\"He has no recollection of being made aware of the tapes or their destruction before yesterday,\" said Perino.\nPerino defended the CIA program as legal and critical to national security. She said President Bush supports General Hayden's explanation that the tapes were destroyed to protect the identities of the interrogators.\nBut the Senate's number two Democrat, Senator of Illinois, rejected that argument:\n\"The defence of the CIA is that they wanted to protect the identity of those CIA employees who were engaged in the interrogation,\" said Durbin. \"Mr. [Senate] President, that is not a credible defence. We know that it is possible, in fact, easy, to cover the identity and faces of those who were involved in any videotape. Something more was involved here.\"\nThe tapes, which documented the use of tough interrogation techniques against key terror suspects in 2002, were destroyed three years later, at a time when there was increasing pressure from defence lawyers to obtain videotapes of detainee interrogations and as Congress had been probing allegations of torture.\nThe Bush administration has maintained it does not use torture, but refuses to say what techniques are used by intelligence agencies in interrogations of terror suspects.

However, it has appeared on at least two other sites as a pay-to-download single - MSN Music Finland and MTV3.fi.\nThe song was one of two recorded last month, and will be released by Sony BMG Finland as an actual CD on January 8 . The other song, titled \"Studs and Leather\", was also written for the movie.\nThe cover art for the CD single has already been revealed. It is a direct tribute to the KISS album \"Creatures of the Night\".\nMost of both songs were composed during Lordi's tour of the United States as part of Ozzfest, with the band's lead vocalist saying in an interview with MonsterDiscoHell.com that the main riff of \"Beast Loose in Paradise\" was written in Milwaukee, while the chorus of \"Studs and Leather\" was composed in St. Augustine. \nHe went on to say that \"Studs and Leather\" had originally been intended for \"Bend over and Pray the Lord!\", an unreleased album from 1999 that had been intended to be Lordi's debut. The verses from \"Beast Loose in Paradise\" had been decided on between the whole band during therapy sessions at Christmas 2006. He said that he had written most of the rest between two US tours, the Ozzfest tour and a tour as the support act for American gothic doom metal band Type O Negative.\nHe continued to deny a recent rumour posted in Finnish music periodical \"Soundi\" that the new material was going to be \"more brutal and raw\" than that on Lordi's last album, \"The Arockalypse\". \"Our music is not gonna get any brutal or heavier, but not any lighter [either]... I'd say these two songs are familiar Lordi. Although \"Beast Loose in Paradise\" is more 'movie-esque' and 'horror-ish' on purpose.

It is called the Reduced Emissions from Deforestation in Developing Countries, or REDD proposal.\nEnvironmental scientists say tree cutting in tropical areas accounts for about 20 percent of all man-made carbon dioxide emissions blamed for global warming. Tropical forests soak up vast amounts of carbon dioxide; burning timber to clear land releases it.\nMarcelo Furtado with Greenpeace in Brazil says the REDD plan is needed to fill gaps in the current Kyoto Protocol, an international agreement to limit emissions of greenhouse gases which does not include ways to preserve forests.\n\"We would like to see, at the very least, a REDD mechanism moving forward, because we want to see countries taking action now. We don't want to wait to 2013 to start seeing this action taking place. And this is something this convention, this group of countries could deliver,\" said Furtado.\nFrances Seymour, Director General for the Indonesia-based Center for International Forest Research, is concerned a premature REDD agreement could do more harm than good.\n\"Because in many forested countries, land tenure rights to forest lands and resources are either unclear or contested or both. And you can imagine that if a potential new income stream is available for those who can present themselves as owners of the forest, this could create conflict and create conditions under which some of the world's poorest people, who are people who live in forests, could be pushed aside,\" said Seymour.\nFinancial analysts are also cautious about the proposal.\nCharlotte Streck, the director of Climate Focus, a Rotterdam-based consultancy, said investors are worried about how governments would monitor their forests and ensure the carbon stored in them remains intact.\n\"This is what makes the private sector nervous, because these are risks that they cannot hedge properly, and that they cannot evaluate in the same manner as the project related risks,\" she said.\nConference delegates are still debating how to monitor the world's remaining tropical forests, how to stop logging in one place without shifting the problem to another area, and how to estimate the amount of carbon in a piece of land.\nYvo de Boer, the U.N.'s climate change chief, said a REDD agreement is unlikely during this conference, but a group working on the details is making significant progress."}

Overclocking (running computer hardware at a higher clock rate than normally) is more of an enjoyment for senior gamers or engineers, while the average computer users may lack the basic concepts of it, causing hardware to halt when they attempt it.\nWith those issues in mind, Wikinews freelance reporter interviewed Peter \"Shamino\" Tan, an overclocking expert from Singapore, to clear up some of the basic issues relating to overclocking.\nInterview.\n It was nice to witness this overclocking festival, and this is my second time after I saw an overclocking test at 2007 COMPUTEX Taipei. What portion of the computing population most often try to overclock their computers?\nShamino: Generally, gamers often try overclocking because several games perform best when graphics display and computing are at optimal conditions. They needs high-level hardware to fulfill the requirements of those games. But some senior engineers also try overclocking tests to examine performance on newly-developed hardware before marketing it. Roughly speaking, any user who understands hardware functioning may experiment with overclocking.\n I remember that in a conference, an expert recommended engineers to be cautious for safety reasons, why is that?\nShamino: If someone wants to try overclocking, all hardware should be waterproof and safety is a paramount issue that experts should be concerned about. If they know the risks and can afford the results of overclocking, then the public can rely on those experts when they do overclocking.\n Which software is recommended when overclocking hardware?\nShamino: 3D Mark, CPU-Z, PCMark05, SysTool, CPUCool, and CPUIdle are often used for overclocking, but it depends on the individual users to make their own decisions. Generally, most experts recommend 3D Mark and PCMark05.\n What about overclocking for the general public?\nShamino: Overclocking has some risks as I mentioned before. It's often attempted by general users or the public who have just witnessed someone doing overclocking. But, in fact, if someone does proper research over the Internet before doing overclocking, then an relatively safe overclocking test can be tried.\n Just some facts about TAITRA: a Live Test Center was established at COMPUTEX Taipei in 2005 and 2006, but it was canceled this year. Although some hardware companies won some awards there, what have been the effects of the Live Test Center on the hardware industry?\nShamino: I remember that a foreign magazine set up this pavilion for companies to examine performances in it. If they are seeking to raise the profile of this pavilion by winning awards, I don't think it's practical.\n Many thanks, I think lots of concepts should be modified according to your advice."}

And only with the commitment of African leaders and European leaders can we really achieve some progress.\"\nThe leaders agreed to increase efforts to fight deforestation and desertification.\nThe president of the European Union, Portuguese Prime Minister Jos\u00e9 S\u00f3crates, said the summit's plan to deal with migration was an example of the new partnership. He says the leaders want to combat illegal immigration but encourage legal migration and help immigrants to integrate more fully into their new countries.\nThe leaders agreed to develop information programs for would-be migrants in Africa and to address the drain of African skilled workers by promoting ethical recruitment policies in critical fields.\nOn governance, the head of the African Union, Ghana's President John Kufuor, said Africa has an interest in good governance and respect for human rights.\n\"Transparency is the order of the day,\" he said. \"This is not to saying there is perfection. The point is that we all see that it is with good governance that we will attract the partnerships for development that we need.\"\nHe noted that the AU has created mechanisms such as the Africa Peer Review to promote these ideals.\nThe leaders also agreed to promote security by developing a system for rapid conflict prevention and funds for an African rapid deployment force, but human rights issues brought discord.\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel criticized Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe's human rights record as bringing shame on the continent. This led Mr. Mugabe to accuse her of arrogance. A dispute over whether to invite Mr. Mugabe blocked the summit for five years and was only resolved a few months ago.\nSudanese President Omar al-Bashir met with United Nations officials seeking to deploy a joint U.N.-Africa peacekeeping force in Darfur.

The accords exempt African exports from European tariffs but also call for lower African tariffs on European goods. European officials said negotiations will continue.\nCivic organizations had little praise for the summit. The Oxfam group said African opposition to the trade agreements should serve as a wake-up call to European leaders.\nHuman Rights Watch said the summit failed to make any progress on restoring the rule of law in Zimbabwe, bringing peace to Darfur or preventing banks from protecting the wealth of corrupt officials.\nAnd Save The Children called the meeting a high profile exercise of little substance, noting that five million African children continue to die of preventable causes every year.

How do you respond to people who say that a fence is more symbolic of divisiveness than a resolution of the issues that cause ?\nIs a fence the remedy for that, or is finding a remedy for the needs and causes of those gangs and for the illegal migration of people a remedy? \nWhat were they coming here to do?\nWhere did they come from?\nConcentrating the political power in Congressional redistricting.\n You were originally elected as part of the Reagan Revolution and you came from a historically competitive district\u2014\n But you won! So it sounds competitive.\nDistricts nationwide have become solidly leaning toward one party or another. Do you think that since our districts are being drawn in ways\u2014and both parties do this\u2014in ways that ensure one party wins, do you think that hurts our democracy?\n\"' that districts \"have\" become more concentrated, that the votes have become more lopsided toward one party, whereas it used to be more that you would find percentages of 47/53, whereas now it is 60/40 or 65/35. You consistently win more than 60-70% of the vote in your district. \n But then they changed it. \n Don\u2019t you think this is a problem we have in the country with both parties doing it?\nIran and nuclear capabilities.\n The came out that Iran has not had a nuclear weapons program in years, but the has been warning us that Iran is a threat. Do you think these two pieces of information hurt our international standing?\n But the IAEA and Mohamed ElBaradei have also come out and said that the National Intelligence Estimate jibes with their findings.\n Isn\u2019t that just conjecture?\n But there is no evidence that they are making any weapons with them, correct?\nTerrorism: the greatest threat to humanity.\n What do you think is the greatest threat to humanity?\n You think terrorism is the greatest threat to humanity?\nI think that\u2019s the greatest\u2014\n Are you for nuclear non-proliferation, then?\n What is technology control?\n Do you think we should begin entering into agreements with other countries to disarm the nuclear arsenal worldwide?\n It seems like it is a difficult thing to argue that we have nuclear arms, but other sovereign nations can\u2019t have them.\n Does it not worry you that governments can change quickly? You had Shah Pahlavi, who was very pro-Western for a long time, overthrown in Iran. President Musharraf in Pakistan, which now has nuclear weapons, is also unstable with his hold on power and has nuclear capabilities. \nThe United Nations.\n You are a critic of the United Nations and it would seem like out of any foreign body that is positioned to assume global leadership on this issue, it would be the UN. Do you think it is wise to take an antagonistic view of that body when it seems necessary to have the global cooperation it embodies?\n One of the things you said was, \u201cRest assured no treaty that infringes the sovereignty of the United States\u2026\u201d \n That\u2019s not an accurate quote?\n If you\u2019re concerned about infringing on the sovereignty of the United States, but the concern doesn\u2019t extend for the sovereignty of other countries, how do you form a foreign policy principle that doesn\u2019t make it seem the concern is only what is good for us?\n[\"Break for Congressman Hunter to attend a conference\"].\n Hi Congressman Hunter. How was the meeting?\n That happens a lot where they put disparate bills together in the hopes of moving them together. What are some of the positives and what are some of the negatives of doing that? \nSchool prayer.\nYou support school prayer?\nNot a school mandated prayer?\nMore a moment of silence?\nPornography.\n You sponsored the Parents Empowerment Act--\n That Act would allow parents or guardians to sue in federal court anyone that disseminates material harmful to minors.\n Can you explain how that does not limit free speech, especially on the Internet?\n What about a pornographic website?\n Are there any studies that show it actually harms children?\n I've spent time in Europe, and I have spent time here. It depends on what you are saying pornography is. For instance, in Europe women are allowed to be bare-chested on the beach or in some places on television. It doesn't seem to harm children there.\n Sure, but what is the bar for pornography, then?\n Would a website with a message at the front saying that a user confirms they are over 18 before they enter the site, would that be sufficient?\n They also try to avoid the X label.\nGay Marriage.\n Do you consider yourself States Rights?\n Why would you support the Federal Marriage Amendment if you are for States Rights?\n Doesn't DOMA prevent that? The Defense of Marriage Act?\n But didn't DOMA prevent that? Massachusetts currently has gay marriage. So didn't DOMA prevent that from happening?\n Prevent a swell of people going to Massachusetts and getting married, and then taking their marriage to another state that bans it and forcing them to recognize it? \n So do you no longer support amending the Constitution is my question.\n Essentially you would want to revoke Massachusetts' ability to have gay marriage?\n So that would be anti-States rights to a degree?\n Why do you think gay marriage is one of those issues?\n How does gay marriage devalue marriage?\n Although we are not a Christian nation--\n\"' The argument against that is should government be involved in it \"at all\" then.\n What about when two Muslims marry, then? Because that's not Judeo-Christian.\n Since it exists in all societies, just because it is practiced by a Judeo-Christian society does that make it a Judeo-Christian institution or a human institution?\n You don't believe that?\n Some Christian churches such as the conduct gay marriages."}

The spill originated from the oil platform \"Statfjord A\", one of three platforms in the field, operated by StatoilHydro.\nKristin Hoffmann of Petroleum Safety Authority Norway (\"Petroleumtilsynet\") told \"Dagens Nyheter\": \"This is the second largest in Norwegian history.\" The amount of oil released into the sea is believed to be at least 3840 cubic metres, 25,000 barrels, or approximately 4,000 metric tons. This amount would rank the spill low on the list of oil spills.\n\"It is a significant amount and we are taking it seriously,\" said Vegar Stokset, a spokesman for StatoilHydro, though he said the spill was \"very far from land.\" \nThe accident occurred in rough seas while tanker \"Navion Britannia\" was loading oil from a storage buoy, StatoilHydro said. Christian Sletner of the Norwegian Coastal Administration said, \"StatoilHydro has a good preparedness plan, and a satisfactory system for handling this.\" He added, \"StatoilHydro is responsible for cleaning up. This is the 'polluter pays' principle.\"\n\"The amount of damage could range from completely marginal to relatively large if substantial amounts reach land,\" Sletner said. \"The chances of it reaching land, at the moment, seem to be relatively small.\"\nNo one was injured at the time of the accident and the platform will continue work as usual Thursday, said StatiolHydro Information Director Kai Nielsen. In a press release, StatiolHydro announced that four vessels are on their way to begin the clean-up, though they will have to wait for calmer seas to begin work.\nPetroleum Safety Authority Norway said in a press release that it is demobilizing disaster teams and beginning to prepare for its investigation of the incident. It will also closely follow StatoilHydro's clean-up.\nStatfjord is 200 km (124 miles) off the coast of Norway, located to the east of Bergen. It is an oil and gas field in the Norwegian sector of the North Sea, though approximately 15% of it is in the United Kingdom's waters. At peak production, it produces over 700,000 barrels of oil per day. The field is one of the largest known under-sea oil fields in the world."}

But the talks had to be rescheduled and moved to a secret location after it became apparent that the two sides had little to discuss. \nAryeh Mekel, the spokesman for the Israeli Foreign Ministry says both sides had grievances to air.\n\"The Palestinians chose to use this occasion to raise grievances. Basically our delegation led by Foreign Minister Livni expressed the need for Palestinians to take urgent action vis-\u00e0-vis the security situation and she mentioned the attacks from Gaza,\" said Mekel. \"As you know today there were more than 20 Qassam rockets fired at Sderot and its vicinity. Also she mentioned the lack of security in the West Bank where only two weeks ago, two Palestinian policemen shot and killed an Israeli resident.\"\nJust two weeks ago, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas pledged to re-start peace talks aimed at reaching a comprehensive settlement by the end of next year.

He also says they raised the issue of Israeli military activities in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.\nTuesday, Israeli troops launched a ground incursion into Gaza \u2014 the largest such operation since June, when Hamas militants seized control of the territory from Fatah forces loyal to moderate Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas.\nThe issue of Palestinian rocket fire from the Gaza Strip into southern Israel is raising concerns of a wider Israeli military offensive in Gaza. But Israel's army chief says his forces will focus on carrying out limited operations in the territory and avoid a broader invasion.\nMeanwhile, the mayor of the Israeli town of Sderot, which has borne the brunt of the rocket fire, resigned saying he could not carry out his duties as long as the attacks continue."}

Mr. Ban recognizes the divisions.\n\"Frankly speaking, realistically, it may be too ambitious if delegates would expect to be able to agree on target of greenhouse gas emission reduction,\" he said. \"But, as I told you, some time down the road we will have to agree on that.\"\nMinisters and heads of states, in a series of speeches, urged nations to lower greenhouse gas emissions. These gases, particularly those caused by the burning of fuels, are believed by many scientists to contribute to global warming.\nLeaders said rich nations should make the first cuts and help poorer nations to develop clean technology.\nThe United States strongly opposes emission targets, as do Japan and Canada. U.S. officials say including emission targets would prejudge negotiations expected over the next two years to find a replacement for the Kyoto Protocol, which expires in 2012.\nBut the European Union and environmentalists say setting emission targets in the draft will show that industrialized nations are serious about the fight against global warming.\nThe U.S. under-secretary of state for democracy and global affairs, Paula Dobriansky, who is heading the U.S. delegation to Bali, says Washington is committed to seeing an agreement reached at the Bali conference.\n\"We are very committed to working toward a successful outcome here in Bali. We want to launch a process that is open and does not predetermine or preclude options,\" she said. \"We have been listening carefully to the perspectives of others and will continue to do so in the days ahead. We hope to identify a way forward that will bridge our differences and bring us together on common pursuit of our shared goal of addressing climate change.\"\nThe text of the conference draft is expected to undergo several revisions before being finalized Friday. It calls for industrialized nations to commit to cutting greenhouse gas emissions by between 25 to 40 percent by the year 2020.\nThe Bali conference is expected to end on Friday. "}

However, his stated goal of deciding on a roadmap for negotiations, which he said needed to address the matter of (GHG) emissions reductions after 2012, and would have to be concluded by 2009, is not yet achieved, there being disagreement on a matter of points.\nChina for example restated a position it had made at the beginning of the first week, calling for 2010 as target year for the so called \"Bali Roadmap\". \nBut a bigger point of contention is that the EU and the vast majority of the 190 nations participating in the conference want to set a target of a 25-40% cut in GHG emissions.

Recent data says they may be as old as the solar system itself.\nThe new scans have indicated that the rings are likely three to five billion years old, and will probably be around for billions of years longer. Scientists previously thought the rings to be only about 100 million years old.\n\"Despite what was thought after the [1970s] Voyager investigations of Saturn - that Saturn's rings might be very youthful, perhaps only as ancient as the dinosaurs - we have results that show the rings could have lasted as long as the Solar System and maybe will be around for billions of years. Recycling allows the rings to be as old as the solar system although continually changing,\" said researcher Professor Larry Esposito.\nThe determination was made when Cassini's Ultraviolet Imaging Spectrograph (UVIS) analyzed the light from the Sun reflecting off particles in the rings of all different sizes. The data had shown that there was a lot more clumpy material and as much as three times more mass than what was previously found in the Voyager missions.\nScientists assumed that particles from an exploding comet may have caused the rings to form, but the new data says that it is unlikely to be the case, because the particles are all of different ages.\n\"Although the Voyager observations indicated Saturn's rings were youthful, Cassini shows even younger ages; and because we see such transient, dynamic phenomena in the rings we are able to reach the paradoxical conclusion - because the rings appear so young, they may actually be as old as the Solar System,\" added Esposito.\nCassini is operated jointly by NASA and the European Space Agency."}

He said that he had mentioned the preceding point of view in the presence of an under-secretary of the US government at a business breakfast this morning. He answered to a later question that he felt disappointed at the current stance of the US government, and wished clarity for the moment.\nAccording to a press release by Greenpeace, the German environmental minister Sigmar Gabriel also declared to the press that the EU would not be taking part in the scheduled MEM in January if substantial progress was not made. Amongst other points that are currently being discussed, one which is often referred to is that of whether or not a guideline frame for emissions reductions is to be included in the preamble of one of the final documents. The proposed frame is 25-40% cuts in greenhouse gas emissions for industrialized nations (known as Annex I nations in UNFCCC parlance), from 1990 baselines. The US is amongst the relatively small number of nations, including Canada and Japan, that are opposed to this.\nAsked what he knew of the matter at an earlier press conference, Yvo de Boer of the UNFCCC stated that Stavros Dimas, the European Commissioner for the Environment, had voiced his opinion that if no agreement is reached now, than there would be no need for the Major Emitting nations meeting to be held, because, so he apparently stated, the MEM is meant to feed into the UN process, and you could not feed something into nothing.\nThe talks being held in Bali are expected to lead to a roadmap for negotiations on greenhouse gas emissions caps for after 2012, which is when the current first phase of the Kyoto protocol is going to run out. Multiple parties, observers, and the top UN executive of the Climate Change branch all had expressed their hope that this roadmap would also include a target date of 2009 for the conclusion of negotiations. The major emitters meeting is a convention of those nations that have the greatest greenhouse gas emissions, and was held for the first time at the invitation of the US in Autumn this year."}

Most countries will probably not hold on the treaty as voters would be likely to reject the treaty; some leaders have committed to hold referendums, but are attempting to avoid doing so for similar reasons."}

A train operated by Robert Morgan, 64, passed a red signal at Purley and struck an oncoming service on March 4, 1989, killing five and injuring 80 more.\nMorgan's train had been destined for London Victoria having left Littlehampton, but after passing through the red light struck a Horsham-to-Victoria train at 60mph.\nMorgan, of Ferring, West Sussex, was ultimately convicted of two counts of manslaughter over the accident to which he had earlier pled guilty, and was jailed in September 1990 for 18 months, of which 12 were suspended. A subsequent appeal reduced this sentence to four months. 47 years old at the time, Morgan had never had any previous problems during his 23 years driving trains.\nHowever, after his conviction it emerged that in the five years preceding the crash there had been four separate Signal Passed at Danger (SPAD) incidents involving the same signal, signal T168. The last of these had itself almost resulted in an accident.\nThe court was also told that had Morgan, who was unable to fully remember the collision due to his injuries, been aware of the previous problems at the time he would not have pled guilty to manslaughter.\nLord Justice Latham said on Wednesday in the court of appeal that \"The history of signal 168... would have been a significant factor in any jury's evaluation of the extent to which the appellant's fault could have been said to have gone from being negligent \u2014 breach of duty \u2014 to being the sort of breach of duty which justified the imposition of criminal sanctions.\" He went on to describe the information that had not been available at the original 1990 trial as of \"considerable significance\".\nHe added that a further SPAD incident that occurred two years after the crash at the site, despite improvements designed to prevent a recurrence of the crash, showed that \"something about the infrastructure of this particular junction was causing mistakes to be made. Had a jury known that, it is at the very least impossible for us to conclude that the jury would inevitably have nonetheless convicted the appellant of manslaughter. These facts would have all been matters which the jury would have taken into account when assessing the level of fault of Mr Morgan. There is no way that we can say accordingly that these convictions are safe. The position is that we allow the appeal against convictions.\"\nLatham acknowledged that Morgan had indeed made a mistake when he passed the signal at danger, but described the area surrounding signal T168 as \"an accident waiting to happen\".\nMorgan's legal team issued a statement from him describing him as \"both delighted and relieved\" that Lord Justice Latham and the two other judges had ruled his conviction unsafe.\nSolicitor Gary Rubin said: \"It is unfortunate that at the time when this tragic accident occurred, the significance of this particular signal being passed at danger on four previous occasions was not properly understood. Due to this lack of understanding at the time, Mr Morgan was placed in a position where he had no alternative other than to plead guilty. The impact of the better understanding has been material to the [appeal] court taking the rare step of quashing a conviction where there had been an original guilty plea so long ago.\"\nMorgan told reporters outside the court \"I am pleased that my conviction is squashed and my name is finally cleared. My thoughts will always remain with those who lost their loved ones.\"\nSources.\n "}

However, the ads will return to air in January.\n\"It's totally erroneous to suggest we're pulling anything,\" chairman of the Workplace Safety and Information Board of Ontario, Steve Mahoney said. \"Our plan from Day 1 was to stop the ads around the middle of December when most of the advertising that's in the media is focused on Christmas and purchasing gifts. We just didn't want to be competing with all that stuff.\"\nIn one of the TV ads a woman accidentally slips on grease on the floor and a large steaming pot falls onto her face, and she starts screaming to death. The ads end with the message \"There really are no accidents\".\nA paper ads shows a construction worker who is in a pool of blood with a forklift operation manual stuck in his chest. Another with a man who is slit by a \"Danger\" sign with his leg stuck in a machine. They show the messages: \"Lack of training can kill\" and the other \"Ignoring safety procedures can kill\".\n\"The critics amount to about 25 per cent rating, and I'm delighted they're upset about the ads because I wouldn't want anyone to enjoy watching them.\"\nThe videos have been viewed more than 70,000 times on the Board's website and are gaining large amounts of views on YouTube.\nThe transit authorities of Hamilton and Mississauga will show modified advertisements. The transit authority of Guelph will show the ads in bus shelters, but the transit authority of Windsor will not because of the graphic nature.\n\"We're not against workplace safety, but this is too graphic,\" said Caroline Postma, chair of the Transit Windsor board.\nMississauga city councillour Carolyn Parrish said: \"My son-in-law was telling me that they shouldn't be on in prime time because when [my grandson] watches them he just about bursts into tear. Now he follows his mom around the kitchen to make sure she doesn't spill grease. And he's only four. There's too much of a chance that ... people are really badly affected by it, and can't really do anything about it anyway.\" She suggested the ads only be aired to workers with the jobs shown in the commercials.\nMahoney changed the earlier promise to air the ads only after 8:00pm to after 9:00pm at last nights meeting with Mississauga city council.\nMahoney said the commercials and paper ads are not \"too graphic at all\". And they are \"absolutely appropriate and they're doing what they're intended to do, they're creating what I call a water cooler topic of conversation.\"\nNinety-eight Canadian workers so far have been killed on the job this year."}

Brown in the chest in 1990. He later asked that no charges be made against her and they resumed dating each other. Two of the arrests for driving under the influence occurred this year, once in May while she was working for the Foundation and once a month after she resigned.\n\"He asked me to marry him after I shot him,\" Doran told \"\" on February 22, 1990.\n\"Wikinews\" has confirmed, through police reports, that she was convicted in four DUI's and also the hit and run. It is also confirmed, she faced an additional charge of driving while a license is suspended or revoked (DWLSR).\nIn 1994, Doran was implicated in the murder of a man who was the lover of her friend, Cassondra Sue Betancourt. Betancourt was later convicted of the man's first degree murder in 1995 after a jury trial. According to court documents, Betancourt, \"brought some cocaine to a hotel room that had been rented by the victim, her lover. The next morning, after defendant left the room, the victim was discovered dead.\" \nDoran, who had prior knowledge that Betancourt would deliver the drugs, made a plea deal with prosecutors that if she testified against Betancourt, she would get a lesser sentence for her previous charges of credit card fraud and petty larceny. Although Doran assisted the prosecution in attempting to gain incriminating evidence by wearing a wire while with Betancourt, Doran never received her lesser sentence. \nDespite the attempt, Betancourt's conviction was later overturned in 1998 because \"there was insufficient evidence to support the conviction. The court held that there had only been circumstantial evidence linking defendant to the crime, and that proof by circumstantial evidence was not sufficient to prove first degree murder,\" added the court papers.\n\"Wikinews\" can also confirm that Doran's husband, Sean H. Doran, a former intelligence officer and major for the U.S. Air Force, to whom she was married for only five days, drowned on their honeymoon on in the Cayman Islands in 1999. According to \"The Washington Post\", the cause of the drowning which led to his death was not known. It was later acknowledged in private records given to the Library of Virginia that his death was deemed accidental.\nSix months later she remarried after meeting a man named Christopher Dale Confer in , Colorado. It was earlier thought she used Confer as an alias, because according to PACER, she filed for bankruptcy in 2001 where she is listed as having \"aliases,\" one being Carolyn S. King and the other as Carolyn Confer. \n\"The Register\" quotes Mike Godwin, the Wikimedia Foundation's general counsel, as saying that the Foundation had no knowledge of Doran's prior or current criminal record. \"We've never had any documentation of any criminal record on Carolyn Doran's part at all. As far as I'm concerned, I have no direct knowledge of [her criminal record] yet...We have, in our records, no evidence of any such thing.\"\n\"Wikinews\" attempted to contact Mr. Godwin via e-mail but no response has yet been received. \nDoran was into her COO position by the at the time. Of the seven board members, six supported her position and one did not. The vote was made and agreed upon on January 22, 2007. She was in charge of \"all office/administrative issues\" and \"overall administration and business operations. Areas of responsibility included administration, personnel and fiscal management. In the future, [she will be in charge of] any new employee working in the administrative area,\" according to public e-mails on Wikimedia's main mailing list \"foundation-l\".\nAccording to , the Chair of the WMF Board of Trustees, background checks were not performed on anyone until at least 2007, but that recently, the Foundation began to perform them. During that time, Brad Patrick was acting Executive Director and he did all the hiring.\n\"In fall 2006, we did not perform criminal background checks. From what I understood, Mike took care of this and this is now being done. It is fairly recent, the board did not get any report on this,\" said Devouard on \"foundation-l\".\nDoran was searched and questioned by U.S. Customs agents in Florida after returning from a Foundation board meeting in the Netherlands around June. According to \"The Register\", it was because she violated the terms of her parole by attending the meeting. She was not arrested, but according to police reports, on October 31, 2007, Doran was arrested under a warrant valid for a \"nationwide extradition\". Doran was then extradited back to Virginia, where she is currently being held in a prison in .\nDoran resigned from her position in July 2007, and the Foundation is currently without a Chief Operating Officer."}

Ibori was to be arraigned yesterday at the Federal High Court in Kaduna. He is facing a total of 103 charges. \nJames Ibori had been governor of Delta for the past eight years, until leaving office in May, 2007.

The decision was made at this year's United Nations Climate Change Conference in Bali. The Roadmap establishes a time frame and scope for reaching a post-2012 climate change agreement. This includes setting, for industrialized nations, targets for reductions of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Numerous observers and parties had voiced that they see this as being of great importance prior to and during the conference.\nFollowing the reopening of the plenary at midday, India reiterated its position that part of a paragraph needed to be reformulated. The EU went on to state that in the spirit of negotiations, they agreed with the proposed changes. After some further statements by other nations, the US said that they can not accept the changes, as they would considerably change the balance of the text. This was met with loudly audible booing in the plenary. Some time later, after a number of other nations voiced their opinions and the American delegation could be seen busily debating and writing, the US said they would agree to the consensus position after all. Standing ovations and cheers welcomed this change in position, which allowed the President of the Conference soon thereafter to declare the document decided.\nIndia this morning had raised objections on one of the central documents of what constitutes the Roadmap. This had made a decision impossible for the time being, as the conference can only pass items unanimously. The objection regarded the phrasing of how nations with developing industries are to take action to slow and reduce their GHG emissions. The President of the Conference, the Indonesian Environmental Minister, had declined the request, stating that the proposal he had made was very finely balanced. The President had then suspended the session so that further consultations could be made.\nNo progress was made when the meeting was reopened about an hour later, with China stating that negotiations of the so called Group of 77 and China with the Indonesian Minister of Finance were still ongoing. China then accused the UNFCCC secretariat of deliberately opening the plenary session at a time it knew that their Ministers were in talks. The Chinese delegate went on to demand an apology by the secretariat, and the meeting was again suspended.\nYesterday's negotiations.\nMinisterial negotiations had continued through the night until the early morning hours yesterday and the climate conference had been scheduled to decide on the last outstanding items this morning.\nYesterday evening Yvo de Boer of the UNFCCC had said that the parties were \"on the brink of agreement\", when he was asked where negotiations currently stand. With almost all open matters having been agreed on by a group of 40 ministers, one of the last outstanding points then was still the question of guideline numbers for GHG cuts.\nSome of the issues that had still been open the day before yesterday (for example how deforestation was to be addressed and the matter of financial support for developing countries to send and support negotiators to the UN climate conferences), had apparently been addressed to everyones satisfaction during yesterdays informal talks. But the talks were still on with regard to preambular text of a document that states how further action to mitigate climate change is to be taken, the inclusion of a 25-40% range for reductions in GHG emissions for industrialized nations by 2020 from 1990 levels being contested. \nThe draft decision proposed by the President of the Conference today however, no longer included the numbers, but did make reference to the latest report by the international body of scientists that is charged with assessing the current state of knowledge on climate change. This Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) had presented its Synthesis report earlier this year. "}

Finally, Hillary Bett from Kenya and Tabitha Tsatsa from Zimbabwe won the title at this race, and Yu-fang Hsu and Wen-chien Wu broke records of local runners to win the Taiwan Champions.\nIn the after-race press conference, Wikinews Reporter made a brief interview for Bett and Tsatsa about images of Taiwan. They praised the friendship on people of Taiwan and scenery during the full-marathon races. They also hoped their fellow runners can participate this race in the future to enjoy scenery of Taipei."}

Agreement was reached on the so called Bali roadmap, but opinions differed on the substance of this and other documents that were decided upon.\nThe Roadmap establishes the target year of 2009 and the scope for a post-2012 climate change agreement. This agreement is expected to include the setting, for industrialized nations, of reduction targets for greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, amongst other things.\nWhile the EU had wished for the inclusion of a guideline range of 25-40% for GHG emission cuts by industrialized nations by 2020, this had been opposed by the US and others, and so was not included in the final \"roadmap\" which addresses all nations that are part of the United Nations Framework on Climate Change Convention (UNFCCC). The range was however included in the preamble of the document agreed on by the members of the Kyoto Protocol. \nBali Roadmap breakdown.\nThe \"Bali Roadmap\" document can be seen as having three distinct sections: \nThe first is the preamble, which is non binding and is there to put the following decisions in context. This is where the guideline emissions cut range would have been. Still included is a reference to the latest report by the international body of scientists that is charged with assessing the current state of knowledge on climate change. This Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) had presented its Synthesis report earlier this year. It also recognizes that \"deep cuts in global emission will be required\" to avoid dangerous climate change.\nThe second part is composed of a section calling for a \"shared vision for long-term cooperative action, including a long-term global goal for emission reductions\" and then goes on with a description of the four \"building blocks\" envisioned for tackling climate change. These are \nThe third and last part is the technical part of the document, with a proposed timetable for meetings and similar procedural matters being included.\nCurrent matters.\nBut it was not just the future that was talked about. There was also consensus on a number of current issues, such as the setting up of an expanded adaptation fund, and the necessity of accelerating the transfer and development of \"climate friendly\" technology.\nOpinions.\nPerspectives on the outcome varied, with some non governmental organizations (NGOs) like Greenpeace International being generally happy that an agreement was achieved, but stating that a stronger mandate for the post 2012 negotiations had been wished for, and that current issues were not all addressed satisfactorily either.\nThe UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon on the other hand welcomed the outcome of the conference, stating that all of his three benchmarks for success had been reached. He went on to say that he \"believes that the Bali Roadmap that has been agreed is a pivotal first step toward an agreement that can address the threat of climate change, the defining challenge of our time.\"\nThe EU also welcomed the agreement that was reached, with Commission President Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso noting that \"We have worked hard to achieve this result. It is a very important step forward.\" Both he and Stavros Dimas, European Commissioner for Environment, made it clear that Bali had only been the start of what needed to be done, with the later stating that \"Now the real hard work must begin. It is essential that the agreement to be worked out over the next two years is ambitious enough to prevent global warming from reaching dangerous levels.\u201d"}

At least ten of the carriages that comprised the service between Karachi and Lahore left the track and fell down an embankment, ripping them apart.\nThe disaster occurred some 250 miles north of Karachi at 2:00 a.m. PST (UTC+5). Pakistan Railways says it appears the derailment, which sent carriages hurtling into a waterlogged field adjacent to the track, was caused by extreme cold, which in turn caused a welded joint in the track to contract and split. Brigadier Nazhar Jamil, head of an army rescue team presently on-site, said he believed another possible cause was excessive speed in combination with inadequate maintenance.\nState-run PTV said that Asad Saeed, General Manager of Pakistan Railways, had told them \"A welded track joint broke. Tracks shrink in winter. There are many forces on the track and sometimes this joint breaks.\" He went on to rule out terrorist involvement and point out that the tracks are old and the government is midway through a programme to replace them. He said other services were not affected.\nThe violence of the crash ripped carriages apart, leaving wreckage strewn across the surrounding area. A segment of one of the rails was torn up, and the engine came to rest approximately a mile away from the initial site of the derailment. Sources vary on how many carriages were involved. \"The Times\" says ten carriages derailed and does not state the total number in the train, while \"Sky News\" reports that twelve of the train's sixteen carriages derailed and \"Xinhua\" gives the numbers as fifteen cars of a seventeen-car train. Reports on passenger numbers also vary, with the train carrying between 700 and 900 passengers, mostly returning from the Islamic holiday of Eid ul-Adha.\nJamil told reporters that many lives were saved by local residents, who rushed many of the wounded to hospital using rickshaws, scooters and donkey-drawn carts. Army engineers had to free the last survivors from the wreckage using two rail-mounted cranes and cutting equipment. One of the last to be rescued was a three-year-old girl, who's foot was seriously injured.\nPolice and soldiers carried the wounded to waiting ambulances, which rushed them to three nearby hospitals.\nPresident Pervez Musharraf has ordered an immediate inquiry, which will be conducted by Pakistan Railways. The inquiry will examine whether any responsibility must be taken by any of those involved, as well as ways of preventing another similar disaster from taking place.\nFatal train accidents occur with some regularity in Pakistan, a problem frequently exacerbated by overcrowding. This is the worst accident since the Ghotki rail crash in 2005. Over 120 people were then killed as the Karachi Express\u2014the same service as in this accident\u2014hit a train that had broken down from behind; the wreckage from both these trains was then struck by a third passenger express. The driver of the Karachi Express had misread a signal.\nSources.\n "}

It is a direct response to the decision of the European Union (EU) to add all 51 of Indonesia's air carriers to the list of air carriers banned in the EU.\nThe EU made the decision to ban the Indonesian air traffic due to a string of accidents in the country, including two major disasters this year - the losses of Adam Air Flight 574 and Garuda Indonesia , which killed 102 and 21 people respectively.\n\"We do not need to buy aircraft from Europe as long as the flying ban stays unrevoked,\" Detik.com quoted Djamal as saying, although Xinhua translated the quote as: \"As long as the ban is still in place, it is better we do not buy [aircraft] from Europe.\" \n\"If aircraft are purchased and registered as Indonesian [in Europe], we are worried the planes won't be able to fly to Indonesia because Indonesian airlines' aircraft are banned from flying over Europe,\" he continued. Djamal is concerned that instead new European planes would have to be flown into Indonesia prior to registration, with higher costs incurred as a result.\nThe announcement, which had already been issued to airlines two weeks ago, was made at a joint press conference with Indonesian Vice President Jusuf Kalla in Jakarta. Djamal told reporters that he felt the best option was the lifting of the ban. \"The easiest way is to lift the ban, because the ban goes against the principle of open sky policy,\" he said.\nIndonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono has already postponed a diplomatic visit to Europe, citing the ban as his reason. Normally, the president flies on an aircraft operated by state-owned national flag carrier Garuda Indonesia.\nA European Commission review was held in Brussels on November 28. Although bans were lifted on Pakistani flag carrier Pakistan International Airlines and Surinam carrier Blue Wing Airlines, the sanctions on Indonesian airlines remained in force.\nMultiple local air carriers are considering the possibility of fleet expansions, with some evaluating Airbus jets as possible options. Airbus, in particular, charge an added cost for taking an aircraft to Indonesia for registration. \"There is an additional cost that must be paid by Indonesian airlines that buy the (Airbus) plane from Europe, US$200,000 ,\" said Djamal. \"Because of that we recommend not buying planes from Europe. As long as the EU ban is still in place, there will be additional payment.\"\nHowever, he went on to say that should a manufacturer be willing to pay the cost itself, he did not object to the purchase of the aircraft. He has also confirmed that no Indonesian officers will be sent to Europe to assist with the situation.\nSources.\n "}

We will all be much the poorer for the loss of his talent, his ability and his friendship,\" Mr O'Leary concluded. \"His vision, his expertise and his dedication to aircraft safety was pivotal to the development of Ryanair.\"\nHis former fiance Michelle Rocca, mother of Claudia, expressed her sadness at his passing: \"He was a wonderful father to Claudia; he and I had a very good relationship over the past number of years and he will be greatly missed by all of us.\"\nOthers described him as a \"well-heeled chap\", and one of the few members of Ryanair early in the airline's history to be able to afford expensive items, such as his luxury car and his high-quality suit. Cathal's prosperity had often helped Ryanir through financial problems in it's early stages.\nSeveral colleagues recalled one famous incident where airport authorities had refused to allow an aircraft he was piloting to be refueled unless it was paid for up front due to an unpaid bill. When Cathal was informed of the issue, he produced his gold credit card to pay for the fuel.\nSources.\n "}

The Japanese whaling fleet, however, still plans to hunt almost 1,000 whales this season. Today's decision will save 50 humpback whales that Japanese whalers had planned to catch and kill in Antarctic waters.\nEnvironmental group Greenpeace welcomed the decision, but the Japanese whaling fleet is still planning to catch around a 1,000 minke and fin whales - its largest catch ever - for what the government calls \"scientific research.\"\nJapan has been under pressure from conservation groups, the United States, Australia and New Zealand not to hunt humpback whales - which are considered near extinction.\nAustralia increased that pressure on Wednesday when it announced it would send a ship and planes to track the Japanese fleet and gather evidence that could be used to mount a legal challenge to Japanese whaling. Greenpeace Australia's chief Steve Shallhorn, says it was Australia's firm stand that forced Tokyo's turnaround.\n\"I think there's little doubt the Australian intervention has caused Tokyo to change its mind,\" he said. \"I think the Japanese government found that they could not defend the killing of humpback whales, which are listed under appendix A of the CITES convention, which is the international trade on endangered species convention.\"\nA Japanese government spokesman says Friday's decision was made after talks with the International Whaling Commission, which is currently chaired by the United States. The spokesman says he hopes his government's decision will lead to better ties with Australia.\nAlthough Tokyo vigorously defends the whale hunt as scientific research, whale meat - a delicacy in Japan - ends up in supermarkets. On Wednesday, Australian Foreign Minister Stephen Smith said bluntly that the Japanese hunt was not science, but \"the slaughter of whales.\" "}

He says tests were carried out among a group of people who became infected with the deadly H5N1 strain of the virus in October.\nDoctor Heymann says an analysis of the information is not yet complete, but preliminary results indicate there was human-to-human transmission of the virus. He says there could have been a common source of the infection. \n\"The team feels, we have not seen all their evidence yet, but they feel that this could be an instance of close contact of human-to-human transmission in a very circumscribed area and not sustained,\" he explained. \"Just like happened in Indonesia and in Thailand.\" \nNine people, including five brothers, became infected with the H5N1 bird flu virus in a small town north of Islamabad. One was a vet involved in culling sick poultry. Two of his brothers fell ill and died. The vet and his other two brothers subsequently recovered.\nDoctor Heymann says H5N1 remains an animal disease. He says there have been only occasional instances where human-to-human infections have occurred.\nThe World Health Organization reports at least 209 people have died worldwide from the virus, most in Indonesia. Scientists fear the H5N1 or another as yet unidentified virus could mutate into a form that could easily spread the disease among humans.\nDoctor Heymann says there were three avian flu pandemics in the last century and other pandemics before then. He says there is a clear understanding in the scientific community that there will be another pandemic of influenza.\n\"We do not know what virus will cause that, but we know there are avian influenza viruses out there and those viruses could cause a pandemic eventually,\" he explained. \"As long as H5N1 is circulating anywhere in the world, there is a chance that that virus can, either through an adaptive mutation or re-assortment, cause a pandemic. The problem is nobody can quantify that risk.\" \nDoctor Heymann says countries have to be prepared to take action when a pandemic strikes and that the World Health Organization is stockpiling H5N1 vaccines. \nHe says they would be used to vaccinate essential populations, such as health workers and security forces, in countries where the pandemic is starting. He says the vaccines also would be used to vaccinate people in areas surrounding a contaminated zone to try to contain the virus and stop it from spreading."}

Although games from the NBA series are not the official games of the World Cyber Games, but with fashions of the NBA, and PC gaming population having a stable scale, the NBA game series attracted not only basketball and game fans but also sporting and gaming media world-wide, and its market was progressively expanded from America and Europe to Asia and other countries.\nWith those issues in mind, \"Wikinews\" Reporter briefly interviewed Event Director of NBA Asia Corporation Ritchie Lai about the sports gaming market developments at the .\nInterview.\nNice to visit this gaming competition by NBA Asia. After I received and read the official press release, I'm really surprised that Japan was not selected as the qualifier stage of the NBA 2K8 Asia Championship Tournament, but Singapore, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Korea were. I know that Japan is one of the great gaming countries of the world, why didn't NBA Asia consider not to select this country and instead select Korea?\nRitchie Lai: Generally, Japan is a notable gaming country, but due to some factors on market share, sponsorships, and gaming population in Japan, we finally decided to give up this plan even though we tried to enter the sport gaming market into Japan.\nAs of some facts on the Gamerscore Blog, famous in Europe and America, several cyber-gaming competitions are often held in many divisions from Europe and America.\nRitchie: You got the point. Because the notability of NBA and the prosperous of the gaming population and market in Europe and America, some of the game stores were risen up with conjunction of the sporting industry.\nIt's a good idea with a conjunction between the gaming and sporting industries. I remembered that a sports game had to be named as the official game of the World Cyber Games since 2001, and during some gaming expositions like G-star in South Korea and Tokyo Game Show in Japan, show organizers often held a large-scale cyber-gaming competition which included PC games and console games for gamers from several countries world-wide. As of some good examples, would the NBA consider to cooperate with some show organizers about holding a gaming championship during a game exposition?\nRitchie: Lots of expositions have their regulations for participated companies so that some expos may not arrange the cyber-gaming competition during the expo. If we [the NBA] also consider factors on sponsoring, market share, background and the nature of gaming companies, it must be complexed. But this marketing style is a good idea for us to improve notabilities for companies from sporting, exposition, and gaming industries. We may consider to try this style in the future.\nNice, thanks. It's really rare and special for the public because the NBA often held activity on sports but sometimes on gaming competitions especially in Taiwan."}

Six have been arrested, and two are still at large.\nThe men charged are Naftali Tzi Weisz, 59, a Grand Rabbi from Brooklyn; Gabbai Moseh E. Zigelman, 60, also from Brooklyn and Weisz' assistant; Yaacov Zeivald, 43, of Valley Village; Yosef Nachum Naiman, 55, of Los Angeles; Alan Jay Friedman, 43, of Los Angeles; Joseph Roth, 66, an international accounts manager at a bank in Israel from Tel Aviv; diamond merchant Moshe Arie Lazar, 60; and Jacob Ivan Kantor, 71, an attorney from Tel Aviv. The first six were arrested last Wednesday, and four of them have been released on bail. The FBI believes Lazar to be in Israel. Kantor is also believed to be in Israel according to other reports.\nThe charitable organizations named as defendants in the charges are Yeshiva Imrei Yosef, Yeshivath Spinka, Central Rabbinical Seminary, Machne Sva Rotzohn, and Mesivta Imrei Yosef Spinka. The FBI alleges that these charities issued fraudulent receipts for bogus charitable contributions and were the beneficiaries of fees charged for transfers of funds as part of a money laundering conspiracy.\nBy a 37-count indictment that was unsealed on Wednesday morning, Weisz and Zigelman are charged with one count of conspiracy to defraud the and other crimes, 19 counts of mail fraud, one money laundering conspiracy count, 11 counts of international money laundering, and one count of operating an illegal money remitting business. Zigelman is in addition charged with two counts of aiding in the preparation of fraudulent income tax returns. Zeivald, Lazar, Naiman, and Friedman are charged in the main conspiracy count and with operating an illegal money remitting business. Zeivald is in addition charged with one count of mail fraud. Roth is charged in both conspiracy counts; several mail fraud counts; and several international money laundering counts. Kantor is charged in both of the conspiracy counts and several international money laundering counts.\nThe charges laid are that over a period of 10 years the conspirators solicited USD8.7 million in contributions to these charitable organizations, promising to secretly refund to the donors up to 95%, allowing the donors to claim the full amounts of the donations as tax deductions on their federal income tax returns. According to the FBI, this was done in two ways: Some donors received cash payments through an underground money transfer network involving Zeivald, Naiman, Friedman, and Lazar, some of whom operated businesses in and around the Los Angeles jewelry district. Other donors were reimbursed via loans made from the United States branch of an Israeli bank, organized by Roth and Kantor and secured on funds secretly held in that bank in Israel, to which the donations had been sent via wire transfer. \nSeveral of the Brooklyn charitable organizations are schools. One such is Yeshiva Imrei Yosef, a private Orthodox Jewish school for boys in grades PK\u201312 with 312 students, which is one of 5000 such organizations approved for charitable donations by the Jewish Community Endowment Fund of the Jewish Community Federation of San Francisco. The Jewish Journal of Greater Los Angeles draws a parallel between these charges and the creation of bogus schools in the case of New Square, quoting Jonathan Sarna, a professor of American Jewish history at Brandeis University, as saying \"I think that in Eastern Europe, especially where corruption was rampant, it was very common for Jews to engage in, shall we say, 'extra-legal activities' when they believed they were doing so not for their personal gain but for the good of the community or for some higher purpose.\" \nHis observation is that defrauding a corrupt government is part of the culture that has sometimes been carried in to the United States, and that people justify it when they believe that the money is going towards Jewish education. \"I think the idea is that Jewish education is so important and so expensive and the folks say to themselves, 'we're forced to pay for public education which we don't use', and they manage to sometimes justify in their own minds these kinds of activities that are for the sake of a holy end.\"\nSarna states that violating the law is not condoned by Jewish communities in the U.S., a sentiment that has been echoed in reactions from the Los Angeles Jewish community, such as that by Rabbi Meyer H. May, president of the Rabbinical Council of California: \"One thing is clear: The Orthodox community deplores any attempt to defraud the government of the United States, and there is no excuse for it, and there's no rationalizations that are acceptable. [...] It's against the Torah and it's against our moral foundation. At the same time, regarding these specific individuals, they should be allowed to have a fair trial, as everyone is innocent until proven guilty.\"\nThe FBI's press release contains a similar reminder of the .\nCalls by the \"New York Times\" were unable to obtain any comments on the case from the defendants."}

The interim Federal Government is the third government headed by the Flemish liberal Guy Verhofstadt and was formed after talks to form a centre-right government of Christian democrats and liberals following the federal election of June 10 failed.\nThe new government is the first Belgian Federal Government that includes Flemish and French-speaking parties belonging to different political families. The asymmetrical coalition includes the Flemish liberals of Open Vld, the French-speaking liberals of the MR, the Flemish Christian democrats of CD&amp;V, the French-speaking Christian democrats of CDH and the French-speaking socialists of the PS. The Flemish socialists are not included in the government, nor is the N-VA, CD&amp;V's Flemish-nationalist partner, however, the N-VA does support the coalition.\nOf the 144 Representatives present during the vote of confidence, 97 voted in favour, 46 voted against and one abstained. The parties that voted in favour were CD&amp;V/N-VA, Open Vld, PS, MR and CDH. Vlaams Belang, SP.A-Spirit, LDD, Ecolo and Green! voted against and heavily criticised the new interim Federal Government and its programme. Symbolically, Sarah Smeyers of the N-VA abstained during the vote. The N-VA had announced in advance that one of its members would abstain in order to demonstrate that institutional reform remains a priority for them.\nThe fourteen ministers of the interim Federal Government were sworn in by King Albert II on Friday, after which Mr Verhofstadt outlined his government's programme in the Chamber of Representatives and the Senate. Extraordinarily, the Chamber of Representatives met on Sunday to debate Mr Verhofstadt's declaration and to vote on a motion of confidence.\nPrime Minister Guy Verhofstadt has stated that there should be a permanent Federal Government under the leadership of Yves Leterme, the Flemish Christian democrat who emerged as the winner of the federal election of June 10, by Easter. \nThe interim Federal Government will concentrate primarily on social and economic issues, while Mr Leterme, who is a Deputy Prime Minister and the Minister of Budget in the new government, will attempt to prepare the ground for institutional reforms, an important part of CD&amp;V/N-VA's platform during the campaign for the federal election.\nObservers have noted the lack of enthusiasm for the interim government. Many fear that it may be overshadowed by tensions between the parties in the coalition as they try to negotiate institutional reforms, including more regional autonomy, an issue on which the Flemish and the French-speaking parties are divided. This is one of the reasons earlier attempts by Mr Leterme to form a Federal Government failed."}

The year author Kurt Vonnegut or mime Marcel Marceau died, both at 84?\nLet's take a look at some of the international stories of 2007. Links to the original Wikinews articles are in bold.\n2007: the stories.\nPortugal: Madeleine McCann goes missing.\nMadeleine McCann (3) disappeared on May 3 in Praia da Luz, Portugal. Initially, a local man called Robert Murat was mentioned as a suspect, although on August 7, Kate and Gerry McCann based on forensic evidence.\nUnited States: Virginia Tech shooting, California wildfires.\nOn April 16, 33 dead, 15 injured in Virginia Tech shootings: A single gunman entered the campus and opened fire on students and faculty in two separate incidents, first in the West Ambler Johnston Hall dormitory, then again two hours later at the Norris Hall classroom building, killing 33 people, including himself. It became the deadliest school shooting in U.S. history. The shooter was identified as Cho Seung-Hui, a 23-year old South Korean national. He was studying English and lived on the university campus. Between the two shootings, Cho sent a mail package to NBC News with his manifesto, pictures and videos.\nIn early September, adventurer Steve Fossett went missing. Fossett reportedly took off in a single engine plane to look for a suitable site in the Nevada playas for his planned land speed record attempt. His former crewmate and rival, Sir Richard Branson remained confident he would be found: \"Steve is a tough old boot. I suspect he is waiting by his plane right now for someone to pick him up.\"\nOn October 12, The 2007 Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to former U.S. Vice President Al Gore and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The Nobel committee cited \"for their efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man-made climate change, and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change\" as the reasons for awarding the prize.\nIn late October, 1,000,000 fled their homes in California due to wildfires strengthened by the Santa Ana Winds. A state of emergency was declared by President Bush and California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger. At a last-minute FEMA press conference with regards to the wildfires, FEMA employees posed as reporters asking what were regarded as overly friendly questions.\nEconomy: Subprime mortgage crisis.\nMany banks in the USA saw their share prices falling after people were found to be unable to pay back many of their mortgages. The mortgages lent to people who may not be able to afford to pay back their loans are known as subprime mortgages.\nThis spread across the stock markets internationally and UK bank Northern Rock had thousands of people queuing outside their bank after they borrowed money from the Bank of England, which is known as \"the lender of last resort.\"\nIraq: US troop surge.\nOn January 10, 21,500 more troops to bring Operation Law and Order to Baghdad was made public. The U.S. forces began to collaborate more intensely with Iraqi troops.\nOn February 21, the UK and Denmark announced troop withdrawals from Iraq. \"The next chapter in Basra\u2019s history can be written by Iraqis,\" said Tony Blair. Following a reduction in violence and troop deaths in the second half of 2007, the U.S. announced troop reductions in November. Meanwhile, Turkey said it would use military action against PKK rebels attacking the country from neighboring Iraq, which the U.S. pledged support for and \"hoped to avoid\".\nRussia: Vladimir Putin and Boris Yeltsin.\nVladimir Putin was named \"man of the year\" by Time Magazine. He would finish his 2nd and last term as President in 2008, although he said he would accept to subsequently become Prime Minister. Under Putin, Russia strove to increase its position as a geopolitical superpower, for example by claiming the North Pole. During 2007 former chess grandmaster Gary Kasparov, now a political activist, drew the attention of the international media.\nBoris Yeltsin, former president of Russia, died at 76 on April 23. Boris Nikolayevich Yeltsin (Russian: \u0411\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0301\u0441 \u041d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u043b\u0430\u0301\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0447 \u0415\u0301\u043b\u044c\u0446\u0438\u043d) was the first President of the Russian Federation from 1991 to 1999. The Yeltsin era was a traumatic period in Russian history\u2014 marked by widespread corruption, economic collapse, and enormous political and social problems. Yeltsin maintained a low profile since his resignation, making almost no public statements or appearances. However, on February 1, 2006, Yeltsin celebrated his 75th birthday. He used this occasion as an opportunity to criticize a \"monopolistic\" United States foreign policy, and to state that Vladimir Putin was the right choice for Russia.\nAfghanistan: opium production, David Hicks.\nMore British troops were sent into Afghanistan, where the war that started after the 9/11 attacks continued with a large number of news events. In late August, it was reported that opium production in Afghanistan reached record highs. Australian David Hicks would become the first Guant\u00e1namo Bay prisoner to be sentenced, after which he returned to an Australian prison to serve out his time and was released on December 29.\nFrance: Sarko for President.\nMay 6: Sarkozy wins 2007 French Presidential election, defeating S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal.

Mahmoud Ahmadinejad pardoned them after 12 days, saying: \nWhile the President of Iran was in New York City for the United Nations General Assembly in September, he was invited to a controversial debate at Columbia University. When challenged by the University President about Iran's treatment of LGBT's, Ahmadinejad stated that: \"In Iran we don't have homosexuals like in your country,\" drawing laughter from the audience. \"In Iran we do not have this phenomenon, I don't know who has told you that we have it.\"\nTurkey: Hrant Dink and Abdullah G\u00fcl.\nOn January 19, Turkish-Armenian journalist Hrant Dink was assassinated in front of the Agos newspaper office where he worked as the editor. Dink was known for writing about the controversial issue of Armenian genocide and the mass killings of Armenians by Turks under the rule of the Ottoman Empire. His assassin was then treated by some Turkish security troops as a \"national hero\".\nIn April and May, several large protests were held across the country by pro-secular Turks, out of fear that Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan would run for President, then due to concerns about Presidential Candidate Abdullah G\u00fcl, whose wife wears the islamic headscarf. G\u00fcl was not appointed in the first parliamentary round, when opposition lawmakers boycotted the vote. The opposition also appealed to the Constitutional Court to declare the process unlawful. General elections followed and G\u00fcl became President on August 28.\nBurma: protests.\nIn Myanmar (formerly Burma) government forces arrested hundreds of monks in September after several days of peaceful demonstrations, but despite the violent treatment from military personnel, the monks returned to the streets. Australian Minister for Foreign Affairs, Alexander Downer, had called \"the continued detention of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and over one thousand political prisoners\" unacceptable. Pro-democracy leaders were arrested and a death toll of more than 1000 was reported. In late October, Myanmar opposition leader and 1991 Nobel Peace Prize laureate, Aung San Suu Kyi left her house arrest to meet with government official.\nUnited Kingdom: Gordon Brown succeeds Tony Blair, floods, and lost discs.\nOn June 24 this year Gordon Brown took over from Tony Blair as leader of the UK labour party and therefore Prime Minister after a long period of time where reporters were predicting the date of Blair's departure.\nAfter this the UK was hit by its worst floods in 50 years. In late November, two computer disks were lost containing the entire Child Benefit database, estimated to contain the names, addresses, dates of birth, child benefit and National Insurance numbers, and sometimes the bank or building society account details of 25 million individuals, in what has been described as \"one of the world\u2019s biggest ID protection failures\".\nNorthern Ireland: home rule, end of Troubles.\nIan \"Dr. No\" Paisley and former IRA commander Martin McGuinness agreed to share power and have home rule return to Northern Ireland after four years of central rule from London. \"I believe we're starting on a road which will bring us back to peace and to prosperity,\" said Paisley, who took the post of First Minister of Northern Ireland.\nJust one day after a car bomb was defused in central London on June 29, a Jeep was driven into the Glasgow International Airport terminal and burst into flames in an unsuccessful terrorist attack. Several people aided the police in detaining the assailants, including baggage handler John Smeaton who received the Queen's Gallantry Medal for his actions.\nAustralia: Kevin Rudd.\nOn December 3, Kevin Rudd was sworn in as Prime Minister of Australia after John Howard and the Liberal Party and Coalition were defeated in the election. After the ceremony, Mr. Rudd signed documents to ratify the Kyoto Protocol on climate change calling it the first official act of the new Australian government.\nGermany: G8 summit in Heiligendamm.\nA post-Kyoto agreement on climate change and combating poverty in Africa were the main topics at the summit of the 7 richest industrialised countries and Russia in Heiligendamm in June.\nWhile France and Germany were calling for quantifiable greenhouse gas emission cuts, the U.S. and Japan believed that growing economies such as India and China would need to join in on such efforts. Advocacy groups were critical about the aid promised to Africa: \"Do they think we can\u2019t read or count?\" asked musician/activist Bono. \"We are looking for accountable language and accountable numbers: we didn\u2019t get them today.\"\nThe G8 Summit was preceded by mass demonstrations, such as the one in Rostock, where several hundred protesters were arrested.\nFinland: Jokela highschool shootings.\nEight people were killed in a school shooting in Jokela, Finland. The shooter, an 18-year-old male student named as Pekka-Eric Auvinen, was arrested after a siege situation, but died due to a gunshot wound from an apparent suicide attempt. The killer had uploaded a home-made movie to YouTube announcing the \"massacre\" one day prior to the shooting. His profile featured several movies regarding an ongoing depression and unsuccessful treatment with SSRIs. Additionally, some movies of him shooting his new gun had been uploaded weeks prior to the shooting. Auvinen also had a personal website which featured images, music and documents, including a manifesto.\nAfter the incident, Finland considered toughening gun legislation. Until then, Finland had actively resisted plans for all European Union member states to limit gun ownership to persons aged 18 and over. The law stipulated that Finns could apply for a gun permit at the age of 15.\nArgentina: Kirchner and Kirchner.\nCristina Kirchner was the favourite candidate to succeed her husband as President. N\u00e9stor Kirchner decided not to run for a second four-year term, without giving an explanation. Mrs Kirchner consistently used her first name during her electoral campaign, which is a similarity to United States presidential candidate Hilary Clinton. However Cristina told the media: \"I don't want to be compared with Hillary Clinton or with Evita Per\u00f3n, or with anybody... There's nothing better than being yourself.\"\nBali: Climate conference.\nThe two-week long ended with an agreement on the so-called Bali roadmap, which was welcomed with cautious optimism. The roadmap details the process for a post-2012 climate change agreement. European Union Commission President Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso stated: \"We have worked hard to achieve this result. It is a very important step forward.\" The European Commissioner for Environment made it clear that Bali had only been the start of things: \"Now the real hard work must begin. It is essential that the agreement to be worked out over the next two years is ambitious enough to prevent global warming from reaching dangerous levels.\u201d\nBelgium: long government formation.\nMore than half of the year in Belgium focused on politics, as the general elections on June 10 promised some difficult coalition talks. PM Verhofstadt recognised his defeat by Christian-Democrat Yves Leterme of Flanders, while the liberals broke the socialist hegemony in Wallonia. Orange-blue coalition talks failed to produce a government for 192 days, when it was Verhofstadt who gathered consensus for an interim government.\nEarlier in the year, Belgium's first black city registrar organised a mass wedding against racism that caught international media attention.\nCanada: RCMP under scrutiny.\nThe RCMP, received a negative spotlight in 2007, particularly for their handling of a distraught passenger at Vancouver International Airport in November. \nRobert Dziekanski, 40, was immigrating from Pieszyce, Poland to live with his mother, Zofia Cisowski, in Kamloops, British Columbia. Since Dziekanski did not speak English airport security guards were unable to properly communicate with him. He started yelling at the airport staff because of this. He used chairs to prop open a door between a customs clearing area and a public lounge, he then threw a computer and threw a small table at a luggage section window. The police tasered him twice and he died.\nFollowing the shooting deaths, in separate incidents, of two mounties stationed in northern communities, there were calls for policy changes related to how and when individual officers should call for back-up. \nItaly: Pavarotti dies.\nOne of the world's best-regarded tenor singers, Luciano Pavarotti, died 6th September. His funeral drew thousands including Bono of U2, and fellow tenors Pl\u00e1cido Domingo and Jos\u00e9 Carreras. Pavarotti succumbed to pancreatic cancer which was diagnosed in July 2006.\nEconomy: Apple's iPhone.\nIn January, Apple announced its iPhone, which hit U.S. markets on July and made customers queue in the U.K. in November. Apple's decision to lock the phone to use one network exclusively was criticized as \"anti-competitive\", and imposed on the phone.\nEuropean Union: Eastern-European expansion and Lisbon Treaty.\nOn January 1, 2007, Slovenia adopted the euro currency, and Romania and Bulgaria joined the European Union. In December, E.U. leaders signed the Treaty of Lisbon, a landmark document which is to redefine foreign policy for the E.U. and creates an E.U. president. The treaty is a replacement for the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe which was abandoned after suffering defeats in referendums in France and the Netherlands. United Kingdom Prime Minister Gordon Brown arrived late and added his signature later.\nSports: Formula One spying controversy.\nFollowing alleged espionage, McLaren (the team of Fernando Alonso and newcomer Lewis Hamilton) was initially cleared but then in September fined $100 million and excluded from the Constructor's championship. The highly controversial and enthralling 2007 season came to an when Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen won the 2007 Championship."}

None of the ten people on board were injured, but the modified Douglas DC-3 was substantially damaged in the accident.\nThe accident occurred on the morning of December 20 local time, about 550 miles from McMurdo Station, a US-run Antarctic base. The aircraft was carrying a crew of four, and six researchers. The flight was part of the Polar Earth Observatory Network project, which is part-funded by the NSF. The project sets up GPS equipment and seismic sensors in various locations across Antarctica, in order to monitor changes in the ice sheets that cover the continent. It is thought that this will aid understanding of global warming.\nAlthough the NSF refused to publicise any details of the crash, one anonymous passenger has come forward about the accident, releasing his account in the form of an online report. According to the passenger, one side of the plane failed to lift off, and the aircraft's wing subsequently dug into the ice.\n\"My seat came unbolted from the floor with me still strapped into the seatbelt,\" the passenger said. \"When we finally came to a halt, we were all in big pile in the corner of the plane with all of the equipment. We got shaken up pretty bad, but there were no major injuries other than some minor cuts and bruises... The wings, props, and tail all got bent up pretty bad. The landing gear, skis, and hydraulic system all were ripped from the plane and strewn about the ice.\"\nFollowing the accident, all those on board spent about twenty hours before they were flown back to McMurdo Station on board two Twin Otter aircraft sent from the base on a rescue mission.

Meanwhile, other areas were devastated by major flooding, with water reaching two metres high in some locations.\nSearch and rescue chief Eko Prayitno in Java told reporters that police, soldiers and volounteers were working together to attempt to reach survivors, some digging with their hands or traditional tools. Heavy equipment is available and efforts are underway to get it into place, he said, but blocked roads are making such efforts difficult.\nPrayitno also said that a single landslide in the Karanganyar region buried 61 people who were attending a dinner to celebrate a successful clean up of a house affected by another landslide, which had caused no injuries. \"They were having dinner together when they were hit by another landslide... At least 61 people were buried.\" Landslides affected the region over a four hour period from 01:00 a.m. to 05:00 a.m. local time. Meanwhile, seventeen people are feared dead in the neighbouring district of Wonogiri, which has also been hit by landslides after twelve hours of nonstop torrential rain.\nAndi Mallarangeng, spokesperson for president Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, told reporters \"The president sends his deep condolence, and has ordered Home Minister [Mardiono] to inspect the scene [in Karanganyar] and monitor the emergency responses.\" \nMany fleeing residents have attempted to salvage their possessions, with some using tyres to float television sets and refrigerators to dry ground. Another single massive slide in Tawangmangu, a mountainous resort, buried 37. Metro TV News was told by an eyewitness, identified only as Karsidi, that \"Those people were gathering for a tea break during communal works after the rains, and suddenly the land collapsed onto them.\"\nThe affected regions spread across Java, Sumatra and Sulawesi. The population distribution in Indonesia has worsened the situation, with many people living on river flood plains to utilise the fertile soil and many more living in inaccessible mountain regions. The total death toll is estimated at up to 81 people, and eyewitnesses and local media report that thousands of homes are affected.\nLandslides are common in Indonesia, where large-scale rainfall is a regular occurrence. This is often exacerbated by deforestation. However, Heru, head of the local disaster coordinator agency in Karang Anyar, commented that \"The forest in the area is thick,\" and consequently he did not believe deforestation was a causal factor. The region he is responsible for has recorded 36 deaths and 30 more buried in thick mud near the banks of the Bengawan Solo river. Meanwhile Julianto, another provincial government official, said \"The landslides took us by surprise. This is the first time in the last 25 years anything of this scale occurred here in Central Java.\"\nJulianto also commented that thousands of people displaced from their homes by flooding and landslides have been forced into temporary accommodation in buildings and tents provided by emergency response teams.\nToday's disasters coincide with the third anniversary of the Asian tsunami, which killed an estimated 230,000 people. A tsunami drill on Java was unaffected as the seasonal poor weather did not have an adverse affect on the area of the drill."}

He also said there was \"a serious lapse of security.\"\nUnited States President George W. Bush said the act that took place was a \"cowardly act by murderous extremists who are trying to undermine Pakistan's democracy\".\nIn a statement today, United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon condemned the killing of Bhutto. \"I am shocked and outraged by the assassination of Mrs. Benazir Bhutto, the leader of the Pakistan People's Party and former Prime Minister. This represents an assault on stability in Pakistan and its democratic processes,\" said Ban. \"I strongly condemn this heinous crime and call for the perpetrators to be brought to justice as soon as possible.\"\nThe Secretary-General also expressed condolences to Bhutto's family and the people of Pakistan. \"While strongly urging for calm and restraint to be maintained at this difficult time, I call on all Pakistanis to work together for peace and national unity,\" said Ban.\nFormer Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif called it \"the saddest day\" in Pakistan's history. \"Something unthinkable has happened,\" he said. Sharif said his party will boycott Pakistan's January 8 elections in the wake of Bhutto's death. "}

It has emerged that last night a bridge was swept away by the swollen river it stretched across, leaving around 40 to 50 people missing in Madiun, East Java. Meanwhile, the total toll of those known or feared to be dead has reached 130.\nAccording to local police chief Supardi in a telephone conversation with \"Xinhua\" the flood waters weakened a foundation, resulting in the collapse. At least twenty motorcyclists, car drivers and passengers are thought to be dead, but as of midnight, no bodies had been recovered. However, three bikes have been retrieved. 100 rescuers have been dispatched to the scene. Continuing heavy rain forced the search to be abandoned temporarily. \nJava as a whole is the worst affected island; in addition to the bridge collapse most of the landslides occurred in two Central Java districts. Health ministry official Rustam Pakaya told reporters that at least 28,000 people have been forced to abandon their homes in central Java, although exact figures are not yet available. The Red Cross commented that 45,000 East Javanese people have been similarly displaced. Thousands are seeking shelter in mosques and other public buildings.\nLandslides buried houses and made roads impassable, while hundreds police officers, military personnel, local officials and volunteers have been digging with farm tools and even their hands to search for survivors. Heavy machinery is available but the road conditions have prevented it arriving at the areas where it is required. Jakarta has dispatched aid in the form of five tonnes of biscuits and instant meals, ten tonnes of baby food and multiple boats.\nHeru Aji Pratomo, head of the disaster management centre in the worst-hit district of Karanganyar has confirmed the recovery of twelve more bodies. This brings the total confirmed death toll in the area to 48. He said that most bodies were recovered from three metre deep mud and required heavy digging machinery to retrieve. 28 remain missing.\nLocal resident Siswo told AFP \"Suddenly I felt my house shaking, and I thought it was an earthquake. When I got outside, I saw that the houses next to mine were already covered by earth,\" and that it struck twelve neighbouring houses.\nIn the next district, Wonogiri, disaster management centre head Sri Mubadi told reporters they had retrieved two more bodies, reaching a total of six, with eleven more missing. He also confirmed that they currently have no access to heavy equipment.\nIn Tawangmangu about 1,000 rescuers were also searching for bodies and survivors without the aid of heavy machinery. Three more bodies were retrieved today.\nIslamic cleric Abu Bakar Bashir toured a Karanganyar village, at which time he commented that he felt the disaster had been caused as a form of divine revenge, saying \"This was likely caused by immoral acts going on here,\" and \"This could be a lesson to be learned.\" The 69-year-old served two years after being linked to the 2002 Bali bombings, before having his conviction overturned last year.\nChalid Muhammad, director of Walhi, an Indonesian environmental group, had a different opinion. \"For five consecutive years landslides and floods have occurred in Java, claiming many lives. The main trigger is ecological destruction caused by deforestation, forest conversions and chaotic spatial planning,\" Chalid told Reuters.\n\"There have been no adequate efforts by the government to protect the people from disasters. When the landslides happened officials were on holiday and there was no access of heavy equipment to the affected areas.\"\nSources.\n "}

Because many of these sites were located in Antigua, the Antiguan government filed a complaint with the WTO saying that the US prohibition constituted unlawful restriction of trade. When the WTO agreed, Antigua pressed for US$3.4 billion in punitive damages. They asked to have this penalty assessed as permission to copy US intellectual property, since there was no trade embargo that Antigua could impose on the US to collect the amount for itself.

Meanwhile, violence has erupted across the nation in protest to the 54-year-old opposition leader's death.\nThe Pakistani government has claimed to have evidence to suggest that al Qaeda were responsible for attacking her at the end of her address to an election rally. One spokesperson for the Interior Ministry said \"We have intelligence intercepts indicating that al Qaeda leader Baitullah Mehsud is behind her assassination.\" Mehsud, believed to be in Pakistan near the border with Afghanistan, is one of Pakistan's most wanted criminals.\nMustafa Abu al-Yazid, a head of al Qaeda in Afghanistan, told the \"Asia Times\" by telephone that the group had indeed been responsible, saying \"This is our first major victory against those who have been siding with infidels in a fight against Al Qaeda and declared a war against mujahideen,\" and that anti-Shi'ite militant group Lashkar-i-Jhangvi carried out the attack on al Qaeda's behalf.\nUnited States federal bodies are attempting to verify that al Qaeda were responsible. One official told the \"Associated Press\" that a bulletin circulated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Department of Homeland Security to law enforcement groups mentioned several Islamist websites posting claims of responsibility. Director of National Intelligence spokesman Ross Feinstein commented that they were \"in no position right now to confirm who may have been responsible.\"\nUnrest in Sindh, Bhutto's home province, was to the extent that the military has been called in to the area. According to officials, unrest since her death has resulted in 32 deaths, including those of four police officers. 23 of the deaths were in Sindh. It is feared that recent events could cause Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf to postpone an election intended to place Pakistan back under civilian rule, which is currently planned for January 8.\nSoldiers were told to shoot to kill violent protesters on sight, as scores of people set up roadblocks and torched hundreds of cars, trucks and buses. Other areas also saw violence; an election meeting in the Northwest suffered a bomb attack that killed a candidate for Musharrif's party and seven others, whilst one was killed in the city of Lahore.\nThousands lined the way as Bhutto's coffin, draped in the tricolor of the Pakistan People's Party, was transported the 7km to the family mausoleum, accompanied by Bhutto's husband Asif Ali Zardari. She was laid to rest alongside the body of her father, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, himself a former Prime Minister hung after a military coup. Zardini prayed at the site alongside their three children, son Bilawal, 19, and daughters Bakhtawar, 17 and Aseefa, 14. Bhutto's two brothers, whose deaths remain officially unexplained, are also buried at the site, which she had herself arranged the construction of.\n\"Reuters\" reported that many at the scene chanted slogans in opposition to Musharraf and to the United States, who for many years have supported Musharraf. \"Shame on the killer Musharraf, shame on the killer U.S.,\" the news agency quoted the mourners as saying. Meanwhile, one farmer told them \"Bhutto was my sister and Bhutto was like my mother... With her death, the world has ended for us.\"\nMusharraf, a former army general, seized power in an armed 1999 coup. For many years he has had US support in the hope that he can keep control in the unstable country, which is afflicted with Islamic extremist violence.\nEconomics in the country have also been much affected, Koichi Ogawa, chief portfolio manager at Daiwa SB Investments, commented that \"Unrest in Pakistan is eroding the market sentiment dramatically as Pakistan, unlike North Korea or Iran, is known to really have nuclear weapons.\" Although the affect was generally to decrease values, lower risk investments, such as gold, went up in demand. \nIndia has reacted to the violence by ordering immediate suspension of all cross-border bus and rail services with Pakistan amid fears that violence will spread. Extremists are known to attack trains, including one attack in February where 68 people died on an Indian train heading for Pakistan. Indian border forces have been put on alert, although no specific threats have yet been identified. Relations between the two countries are peaceful but tense, and Indian border forces regularly go on alert at times of crisis in Pakistan.\nSources.\n "}

On December 25, Tatiana, one of two Siberians at the Zoo, climbed the wall and attacked three people, killing one. Reports say that Tatiana used her front claws to grab on the observation ledge of the enclosure and pull herself up out of her habitat.\nOn Wednesday the Director of the Zoo, Manuel A. Mollinedo told the media that the enclosure's wall was 18 feet high, but today he came forward and admitted that the wall was only 12 feet 5 inches high. The Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA) recommends the wall be at least 16 feet high. Mollinedo also said that he believes Tatiana escaped her enclosure by jumping or climbing it.\nThe Zoo is accredited with the Association through 2011. According to the Association's website, for a zoo or aquarium to become accredited with the AZA, they must fill out an application and \"the [AZA] Accreditation Commission [must] evaluate every zoo or aquarium to make sure it meets AZA's standards for animal management and care, including living environments, social groupings, health, and nutrition. We also make sure that animals are provided with enrichment, which stimulates each animal's natural behavior and provides variety in their daily routine.\" The commission meets twice a year to evaluate applications.\n\"The San Francisco Zoo is a great zoo, it's an accredited AZA member in good standing, and it has our support during this difficult time. AZA mandatory accreditation standards require that the San Francisco Zoo provide a thorough report to its independent Accreditation Commission, which will review it and determine any actions that need to be taken. We will not speculate on what action might be taken until the facts are fully reviewed,\" said a statement on the AZA's website posted on Wednesday.\n\"AZA-accredited zoos are safe. Until this incident, there had not been a visitor fatality resulting from an animal escape at an AZA-accredited zoo. AZA mandatory accreditation standards require safety and emergency protocols that go beyond federal, state or local requirements. Regular safety training and annual emergency drills are required by these mandatory accreditation standards,\" added the statement.\nAccording to Mollinedo the Association inspected the Zoo in 2004, but never pointed out that the wall was too short. The enclosure is also surrounded by a dry moat that is 12 feet deep at the corners and 13 feet deep at the center.\nPolice are still investigating the incident and deny reports that the injured brothers Kulbir Dhaliwal, 23, and Paul Dhaliwal, 19 along with their friend Carlos Sousa Jr., who was killed, were taunting Tatiana by dangling a leg into her enclosure. Police do say that a footprint was found at the scene, but no further details are known. The brothers both received severe upper body and arm lacerations, but are expected to be released from the hospital on Saturday.\n\"We have no information at this point that they did or did not go over the railing,\" said Chief of the San Francisco Police Department, Heather Fong.\nOn Wednesday, Fong stated that \"[The incident is being treated as a crime] because we're not certain why the incident occurred - as result of human action or whether this was an incident where the animal was able to get out of the grotto.\"\nThe Zoo remains closed for business and it is not known when it will reopen."}

A trial is scheduled to begin on August 14, 2008.\nThe charges stem from an arms deal with a French company, which is alleged to have involved bribes and fraud. Zuma's financial adviser at the time, Schabir Shaik, was convicted in 2005 of attempting to solicit a bribe of US$72,500 per year from the arms company on Zuma's behalf and was sentenced to 15 years in prison. Zuma was fired as deputy president in 2005 by South African President Thabo Mbeki due to the scandal.\nTwo-term ANC leader Mbeki recently lost an ANC leadership contest to Jacob Zuma, who garnered about 60 percent of delegate votes in his win.\nZuma had been charged with corruption in 2005, but the case was dismissed on procedural grounds. Michael Hulley, Zuma's defence lawyer, indicated that they will strongly contest the new charges in court. Hulley also suggested that the South African government's National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) and its anti-organised crime division known as The Scorpions, have carried out a smear campaign against Zuma.\n\"These charges will be vigorously defended, in the context of the belief that the Scorpions (NPA) have acted wrongly and with improper motive calculated to discredit Mr. Zuma and ensure that he play no leadership role in the political future of our country,\" said Michael Hulley in a statement.\nGiven that the ANC has been the governing party in South Africa since the end of apartheid in 1994, it is likely that Jacob Zuma could become the next president after general elections in 2009. Zuma has said, however, that he would resign if he was found guilty by the courts."}

As part of the plea agreement, all but nine months of the sentence was suspended and in May of 2007, Hicks was transferred to Yatala.\nA contentious part of his sentence was a ban placed on Hicks to prevent him from speaking with the media for a period of one year from the time he pleaded guilty, which was in March, 2007.

He received treatment for around five minutes before being stretchered off and transferred to a waiting ambulance. David Clarkson, O'Donnell's nephew, was also playing at the time and had scored twice but was taken off due to being visibly distressed by O'Donnel's collapse.\nMedics from both teams believed he had suffered a seizure. Attempts were made in the ambulance to revive him, but these failed and he was pronounced dead at 17:18 GMT, having been taken to Wishaw General Hospital.\nBorn on March 25, 1972 O'Donnell made his debut for Motherwell in 1990, and scored the following year in the final of the Scottish Cup, which Motherwell defeated Dundee United 4-3 in. In 1993 he earned his only international cap for Scotland as a substitute in a World Cup qualification match against Switzerland.\nThe following year he was bought by Celtic for \u00a31.75 million ($3.5 million). He stayed with them for five years, after which he was transferred to Sheffield Wednesday. A high number of injuries caused Sheffield Wednesday to release him after four years, and the next year, 2004, then Motherwell manager Terry Butcher awarded him an 18-month contract. In 2006 he was appointed captain, and in April the following year, upon the expiration of his original contract, signed a new one as a player-coach.\nMotherwell chairman Bill Dickie said \"Unfortunately I can confirm very, very sad news that Phil O'Donnell has lost his life.

The violence has left at least 44 people dead and dozens injured. Mr. Musharraf insisted the measures were to protect people. VOA's Ayaz Gul reports from Islamabad that a bitter dispute has also erupted over how the 54-year-old politician died and who was behind her assassination.\nThursday's assassination of Ms. Bhutto has plunged the Pakistani nation into a situation that many perceive as a crisis, with violent protests across the country. Officials say the violence has also caused tens of millions of dollars in damages. Most of the deaths have occurred in southern Sindh province, which is Ms. Bhutto's political stronghold.\nThe worsening security situation prompted President Musharraf on Saturday to order his security chiefs to deal firmly with violent protesters.\nMs. Bhutto was killed when an unknown attacker fired shots at her and then blew himself up as she was leaving an election rally in Rawalpindi on Thursday.\nPakistani officials say that Ms. Bhutto's death occurred when the force of the suicide blast crashed her head against a lever on the sunroof of her vehicle. An official investigation is under way, but leaders of Ms. Bhutto's party have rejected the official account of her death as \"ridiculous.\" \nMs. Bhutto's senior advisor, Sherry Rehman, says she helped wash the slain politician's body for burial. She alleges the government is trying to cover-up its failure to protect Ms. Bhutto, who was campaigning for January 8 elections.\n\"It is very clear, it is running on all the Pakistan TV channels, the footage of an assassin who took clear aim at her with his gun and fired the shot that went through the back of her head and came out the other,\" she said. \"I have seen the bullet wound myself. I was part of the bathing ritual party and she bled to death from that wound.\"\nInterior Ministry spokesman Javed Cheema told reporters in Islamabad Saturday that the government's version is based on a medical report and other evidence collected from the scene of the attack.\n\"Now, if there is any doubt, if they say that she died of the bullet wounds, we don't mind,\" he said. \"If the Peoples Party's leadership wants, her body can be exhumed and post-mortemed. They are most welcome, but we gave you what the facts are.\"\nPakistani authorities have accused a pro-al-Qaida fugitive tribal leader, Baitullah Mehsud, of ordering Ms. Bhutto's assassination.\nBut a spokesman for Mehsud has denied the militant leader had anything to do with the assassination. Government spokesman Cheema says investigators have collected irrefutable evidence of Mehsud's involvement in the suicide attack on Ms. Bhutto.\n\"No criminal would ever accept responsibility of a crime that one has committed.

We were first warned of the possibility of this additional work on 6 December.\"\n\"Because of the seriousness of the situation we felt it necessary to refer the matter to the Office of Rail Regulation. We simply cannot have NR bullying train operators in this way just because their engineering planning processes are in a mess.\"\nThe company has warned passengers that journeys are likely to be extended by an hour or more in some cases. \nWhilst the ORR will be investigating the complaint from Virgin, they have ruled that the work should still go ahead. \nA spokesman for Network Rail said, \"Work will be ongoing for most of the next year, but the Christmas period is the last major opportunity we have to do key work while passenger numbers are down during the relatively long holiday period.\n\"It was only realised at the beginning of December that work was falling behind. Rail companies are usually given 12 weeks notice of engineering work. Virgin were told only at the beginning of the month, so that is very late.\n\"Network Rail is extremely sorry and apologises to passengers for the inconvenience.\"\nAccording to the company, the engineering works will contribute to enabling increases in service frequencies and reductions in journey times on the West Coast Main Line from December 2008."}

This broke Peyton Manning's record of 49 touchdown passes and Jerry Rice's record of 22 touchdown catches. The Patriots also ended up with a record-high 589 points for the season.\n\"In this game of football, it's hard to go 16-and-0,\" Moss stated. \"As a football player and a fan of the game, my hat's off to this organization.\"\nDon Shula, coach of the undefeated 1972 Miami Dolphins, commended the Patriots, saying \"going undefeated during the regular season is a remarkable achievement.\"\nIn an attempt to reach as many viewers as possible, the game was simulcast on three networks, with the coverage from NFL Network (only digital/satellite channel) being broadcast on NBC and CBS.

JTF-GTMO estimated that he was born in 1939.\nAccording to the JTF-GTMO press release that announced his death:\nAbdul Razzak was one of the few Guantanamo captives who continued to attend his Combatant Status Review Tribunal and his annual Annual Review Board hearings. \nAbdul Razzak had disputed all but one of the allegations against him, at each opportunity, and had provided his JTF-GTMO interrogators and the officers who sat on his CSR Tribunal and ARB hearing with easily verifiable corroborated details. At each of his Administrative review the officers were unaware of the exculpatory details he had provided.\nThe one allegation that Abdul Razzak acknowledged was that he had been subjected to involuntary conscription, and had served the Taliban for three months out of every year for the five years they were in power before he fled Afghanistan. He had, however, not served in the Taliban's armed forces, but had been a truck driver, delivering non-military supplies.\nOne of the main allegations against Abdul Razzak was that he had plotted to help free Taliban leaders. Abdul Razzak testified that, on the contrary, two years prior to al Qaeda's attacks on September 11th, 2001, he and his son had played a key role in a successful plot to free three imprisoned senior Northern Alliance leaders, who he identified as \"Ismail Khan, Haji Zahir, son of vice president Haji Qadir and General Qassim.\" -- Ismail Khan is currently the Minister of Energy.\nAbdul Razzak testified that his son, one of the relatively few Afghans who was fluent in English, had been conscripted by the Taliban, so he could provide some computer support. His son had contacted anti-Taliban forces, secured funds to purchase a four-wheel drive vehicle. His son, using the trust the Taliban had placed in him, due to his computer support, had lead the three men out of their imprisonment. Abdul Razzak had driven the four by four. \nThe vehicle was damaged by a land mine. Abdul Razzak's hand was injured. His son lost a foot. But the Northern Alliance leaders were rescued.\nAbdul Razzak testified that when they arrived in Iran the Afghanistan Council paid his living expenses. But, when Hamid Karzai assumed power, following the ouster of the Taliban, he was told that the pension would be discontinued, because Afghanistan now had a democratic government. \nAbdul Razzak testified that he then returned to Afghanistan, where he was falsely denounced by a distant cousin named Mohammed Jan. Mohammed Jan's branch of the family was engaged in a feud with his branch, that had lead to the death of his father, two uncles, and three of his sons.\nAbdul Razzak was also accused of being a leader of anti-coalition forces, and of being a member of the Hezb-e-Islami Gulbuddin, an older militia, which was first founded to oppose the regime of Mohammed Daoud Khan,\nthe politician who had ousted Mohammed Zahir Shah, the last King of Afghanistan, in 1973.\nIn 1979 this militia split, and has been lead, since then, \nby Gulbuddin Hekmatyar.\nGulbuddin Hekmatyar's militia played a major role in the resistance to the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan. This militia acquired a reputation for ruthlessness, and disregard for civilian life.\nAbdul Razzak testified that his only contact with the Hezb-e-Islami Gulbuddin militia was early in the war against the Soviets. He testified he was imprisoned for four and a half months in an underground pit. They had captured him because he had served as a driver for a member of the communist regime.\nAmerican intelligence analysts assert that, when Osama bin Laden was leaving Sudan, Gulbuddin Hekmatyar offered him sanctuary in the areas of Afghanistan under his control.\nAlthough not part of the Northern Alliance the Hezb-e-Islami Gulbuddin militia fought with the Taliban, prior to their ouster. When the USA allied with the Northern Alliance and other resistance forces to oust the Taliban the Hezb-e-Islami Gulbuddin militia fought against the USA. In 2003 the Hezb-e-Islami Gulbuddin formed an alliance with the rump of the Taliban.\nAbdul Razzak was also accused of being the Abdul Razak who had been the second in command of the Taliban's 40-man unit, even though witnesses described Abdul Razak the commander as a much younger man, with a full black beard. Americans held five other men in Guantanamo named Abdul Razak."}

The operator decided to close the lift and waited for the lift to unload all passengers; at the moment of the catastrophe the bottom station of the lift was already closed, but 75 passengers were still on the lift.\nAccording to the Swiss law, every chair lift must be designed to withstand a lateral wind load of 250 newtons (approx. 25kg) per square meter. However there is no law limit at which wind speed or lateral loads the chair lifts have to be stopped. This safety aspect is left to the responsibility of the operator. The safety of the lift was checked by the Swiss Federal Office of Transport in January 2006. This chairlift accident is said to be the worst in Switzerland for the last 8 years. "}

Anjana Pasricha reports from New Delhi the withdrawal is largely symbolic because the Norwegian-brokered truce collapsed two years ago. \nThere have be many clashes between the government and the rebels since mid-2006. This happened despite the fact that they were still in a cease-fire.\nThe government's decision to end a 2002 truce agreement with Tamil rebels came as a vast majority of people believed that the pact existed only in name.\nThe announcement came late Wednesday after a meeting among senior Cabinet ministers. \nSri Lanka's foreign secretary, Palitha Kohona, says the government is \"reluctantly\" ending the truce because it did not achieve what it was supposed to - a peace settlement with the rebels, known as the LTTE.\n\"From the beginning it was observed only in the breach by the LTTE. In the first couple of years, it used the cease-fire agreement to regroup, rearm, and then in 2005 it launched massive attacks on government forces,\" said Kohona. \"In a real practical sense, this agreement served very little purpose.\"\nBoth the rebels and the government routinely blame each other for the resumption of hostilities. The fighting began soon after a hard-line government took over in Colombo, and the rebels accused the government of a lack of seriousness in pursuing peace talks. The Tamil rebels want an autonomous homeland for Sri Lanka's minority Tamil community. \nIn the past two years, near-daily clashes on the battlefield, assassinations and bombings have killed about 5,000 people.\nPolitical analysts say ending the truce will polarize the two sides even further. They say the government , which has scored some military successes against the rebels, wants to defeat them on the battlefield. \nSri Lankan foreign Secretary Kohona says ending the country's ethnic conflict should not be linked to negotiations with the rebels. \n\"A political settlement is not necessarily going to be with the Tamil Tigers,\" added Kohona. It will take into account the concerns of the Tamil people of Sri Lanka and the other minorities of Sri Lanka.\" \nNorwegian mediators have expressed concern about the government's decision to end the truce, calling it a \"serious step.\" Norway's foreign ministry Web site says there have been increasingly frequent and brutal attacks by both parties, and there is concern that violence and hostilities will escalate further. \nThe truce had received wide international support, and raised hopes of ending the country's quarter-century long ethnic conflict.

The researchers evaluated records of 6,789 cardiac arrest patients in 369 hospitals. Medical guidelines recommend shocking cardiac arrest victims' hearts back to life within two minutes using defibrillator paddles. \nWhen the defibrillation was delayed, only 22.2 percent of patients survived long enough to be discharged from the hospital, as opposed to 39.3 percent when the shock was given on time. The researchers compared those statistics with more than 50 percent of patients who survive heart attacks while in a crowded airport or a casino, where defibrillators are readily available.\nThe researchers concluded that delayed defibrillation is common and is associated with lower rates of survival after in-hospital cardiac arrest."}

The fuel sensors are part of a system to prevent the shuttle from running on an empty tank, which could cause pumps in the engine of break and possibly trigger a disastrous explosion. \nWhen the problem reoccurred, NASA ran a fuel test, which led them to believe the problem lied in the faulty connector. The connector was then removed from the tank and taken to Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama, where it is currently undergoing extensive analysis and modification.

The ACRO reports that fatal aircraft accidents involving planes carrying over six people were at their lowest since 1963, while Aon reports that fatal accidents on commercial airliners totaled 23, which \"Flight International\" reports to be an all-time low.\nACRO reports that 136 crashes killed a total of 965 people worldwide. It says this is 28 fewer crashes than 2006, and also a 25% decrease in fatalities. \"Flight\" reported that 23 fatal commercial airliner crashes killed a total of 597 people. That accident rate is the lowest it has ever been, and both figures are well below the average for the last decade, which came in at 35.5 and 846.3 respectively. In 2006, 27 fatal commercial aviation accidents killed 863 people.\nAon reports that in 2007 there were 47 commercial hull loss accidents, including all 23 fatal accidents. That includes three accidents involving mishaps occurring to parked aircraft (including China Airlines Flight 120, a Boeing 737-800 that caught fire at the gate with passengers still on board). One hull loss is not included in the statistics; an Airbus A340-600 was destroyed after it rammed a wall during ground testing in Toulouse, but was not counted because the new aircraft was still with Airbus and was yet to be delivered to its first owner, Etihad Airways.\n\"In 2007, more than two billion were traveling worldwide and we have thousands and thousands of aircraft, airplanes flying every day worldwide, it means that airplanes, aviation is one of the safest transport modes in the world,\" said Ronan Hubert, aviation accident historian and head of ACRO.\nAccording to Hubet, the highest number of accidents recorded in an individual country was 34 in the United States, followed by Canada, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Colombia and Indonesia. However, he defended US air safety, pointing out that North America accounts for most of the world's air traffic and therefore it was to be expected that there would be a high level of accidents there. He went on to criticise African air safety, which is so poor that most African airlines are on the list of air carriers banned in the EU. He blamed this on political factors. \"We know today that countries like Somalia, Sudan and DRC [Democratic Republic of Congo], they are totally unsafe,\" said Hubert. \"But, we know why. Somalia is today a country of which you have a civil war for many years. Sudan, you have big problem of corruption. You have the Darfur problem. You have the civil war also and on the DRC there is plenty of corruption problems also.\"\nHubert makes a distinction between fly-by-night operators in several African countries and reputable national carriers in most African countries. He says national carriers in Kenya, South Africa, Sudan, the North African countries and others are reliable and safe. He says international flights to and from Africa are not the problem, as most of the plane crashes and deaths take place during internal flights in Africa by small, dangerous carriers.\nThe worst aviation disaster all year was the crash of TAM Linhas A\u00e9reas Flight 3054, an Airbus A320 that overan the runway at Congonhas-S\u00e3o Paulo International Airport in Brazil killing 187 on board and 12 on the ground. The disaster was one of just two fatal commercial passenger aircraft accidents that did not either occur in the third world or involve an aircraft registered there. The other was the crash of UTair Flight 471, a Tupolev Tu-134 which crashed while attempting to land at Samara Kurumoch Airport, Russia, killing six of the 57 passengers on board.\nCongo saw more fatal commercial air crashes than any other country. Four cargo aircraft and two Let 410 passenger flights suffered fatal crashes. One of these accidents involved an Africa One plane which came down in the capital of Kinshasa, killing many on the ground. Indonesia also had a particularly poor year, with two major disasters. Adam Air Flight 574 crashed near Sulawesi; all 102 on board are missing, presumed dead. Later, Garuda Indonesia Flight 200 shot off the runway at Yogykarta International Airport, killing 22.

Riot police used force to break up the protests, and Mr. Saakashvili declared a state of emergency, which included the closing of independent media.\nCandidate David Gamkrelidze, leader of the conservative New Rights Party, says lack of time prevented him from extensive campaigning, particularly in Georgia's mountainous rural areas.\n\"And, of course, these 45 days [were] not enough when you have such shortage of money,\" he said. \"It was quite difficult to bring all your messages, all ideas, all program priorities to voters.\"\nGamkrelidze also accuses Mr. Saakashvili of using administrative resources of the presidency to run his campaign.

They also held a press conference declaring their freedom.\n\"We are no longer citizens of the United States of America and all those who live in the five-state area that encompasses our country are free to join us. This is according to the laws of the United States, specifically article six of the constitution,\" said Means during the press conference.\nSince then, Russell Means has gone on to announce the formation of a \"provisional government\" of the \"Republic of Lakotah\" with himself as Chief Facilitator, as well as to promote the establishment of a bank and a utility company for the country. Despite the claim Means has made, Naomi Archer, liaison of Lakotah Oyate stated to \"Wikinews\" that Means took control of the organization and hijacked it and its website on December 29. Archer also said that Lakotah Oyate or the delegation are not a government entity and do not make decisions for the Nation.\n\"The legitimate actions of the Lakota people are not determined by one person [Russell Means] or even one group, but by the [Lakota] people themselves,\" added Archer. \nOther signers of the withdrawal letter are all still involved in the movement, including Canupa Gluha Mani who heads the Strong Heart Warrior Society which will \"probably become the paramilitary force\" of Lakotah, said Archer. \"Wikinews\" asked Archer if Means would still be involved in the movement, but she refused to comment.\nThe Bank of Lakotah and Provisional Government of Lakota are not supported by Lakotah Oyate; Means is acting without having consulted the other elders of Lakotah; Means is himself, at age 69 [sic], an elder, and \"people need their elders to set better examples than that,\" said Archer.\nWhile the idea of establishing a power company, bank, and other such institutions was an idea that had come from Means and the rest of Lakotah Freedom Delegation knew that he was going off to Washington D.C. on his own to conduct negotiations, they did not know what the negotiations were going to be regarding. Lakotah Oyate hopes that this dispute will be resolved in a few weeks because this \"all has to be about the people\".\nSince the Delegation's press conference, the Rosebud Sioux Tribe and the Cheyenne River Reservation have rejected Means's and the delegation's declaration of secession.\n\"They're individuals acting on their own. They did not come to the Rosebud Sioux tribal council or our government in any way to get our support and we do not support what they've done. We do not support what Means and his group are doing and they don't have any support from any tribal government I know of. They don't speak for us,\" said Rosebud Sioux Tribe president, Rodney Bordeaux.\nDespite those rejections, Archer said that the Pine Ridge Reservation's council may \"consider the proposal.\" A representative for the Standing Rock Reservation's council has said that that reservation is also considering Lakotah Oyate's proposal. Lakotah Oyate have also been holding discussions with \"about 150\" other indigenous organizations in the U.S. and mentioned particularly the Native Hawaiians."}

Newspapers in Senegal have described the cancellation as a death sentence. Meanwhile, the town of in Portugal, intended to be the rally\u2019s first scheduled stop, are considering filing for damages against Amuary.\nVictor Anderes, vice-president of a New York firm specialising in high-profile event security, called the cancellation an unprecedented one in sporting history, saying \u201cSmaller cultural events have been cancelled , but this hasn\u2019t happened with such a major international event.\u201d However, he did accept that \u201cThe threat is significant.

Allegations of intimidation, media bias, and vote buying were widespread.\nIn a report, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) called the election \"consistent with most O.S.C.E. and Council of Europe commitments and standards for democratic elections\", but also noted violations, including people apparently voting more than once at certain polling stations and some ballot boxes not being properly sealed.

Along with technology writers for \"Slate\", \"PC Magazine\", \"USA Today\", \"BusinessWeek\", \"Aviation Weekly\", \"Wikinews\" was invited by the America-Israel Friendship League and the Israeli Foreign Ministry to review Israel\u2019s technology sector. It's part of an effort to 're-brand the country' to show America that there is more to Israel than the Palestinian conflict. On this trip we saw the people who gave us the Pentium processor and Instant Messaging. The schedule was hectic: 12-14 hours a day were spent doing everything from trips to the Weizmann Institute to dinner with . \nOn Thursday, the fifth day of the junket, David Saranga of the foreign ministry was able to arrange an exclusive interview for with the President of Israel, Nobel Peace Prize recipient Shimon Peres. For over an hour they spoke about Iranian politics, whether Israel is in danger of being side-lined in Middle Eastern importance because of Arab oil wealth, and his thoughts against those who say Israeli culture is in a state of decay. \nShimon Peres spent his early days on kibbutz, a bygone socialist era of Israel. In 1953, at the age of 29, Peres became the youngest ever Director General of the Ministry of Defense. Forty years later it was Peres who secretly gave the green light for dialogue with Yassir Arafat, of the verboten Palestine Liberation Organization. It was still official Israeli policy to not speak with the PLO. Peres shares a Nobel Peace Prize with Yitzak Rabin and Arafat for orchestrating what eventually became the Oslo Accords. The \"roadmap\" that came out of Oslo remains the official Israeli (and American) policy for peace in the Palestinian conflict. Although the majority of Israeli people supported the plans, land for peace was met with a small but fiery resistance in Israel. For negotiating with Arafat, former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu shouted at Peres, \"You are worse than Chamberlain!\" a reference to Hitler's British appeaser. It was during this time of heated exchanges in the 1990s that Yitzhak Rabin was assassinated by Yigal Amir, a Jew who thought it against Halakhic law to give up land given by God (Hashem).\nPeres is the elder statesman of Israeli politics, but he remembers that he has not always been as popular as he is today. \"Popularity is like perfume: nice to smell, dangerous to drink,\" said Peres. \"You don\u2019t drink it.\" The search for popularity, he goes on to say, will kill a person who has an idea against the status quo. \nBelow is 's interview with Shimon Peres, the President of Israel.\nIsraeli technology.\nDavid Shankbone: One of your big initiatives in technology has been nanotechnology. \nDS: What made you focus on nanotechnology as a sector for Israeli investment?\nDS: The bomb?\nDS: To miniaturize?\nDS: That\u2019s amazing.\nDS: Are you satisfied with the progress in the nanotechnology sector here in Israel?\nThe future of the peace process in Israel.\nDS: Mr. President, as a Nobel Peace Prize recipient and as one of the fathers of the modern peace process in Israel, do you still think that there is a future to the peace process?\nDS: How do you approach the difficult challenge of talking to the Palestinians when, in the end, they don\u2019t want Israel to exist. How do you come to an understanding to make peace possible?\nDS: How do you feel about that?\nThe waning importance of history.\nDS: Isn\u2019t the answer to that question that wise decisions are made with a basis from memory? Although a computer can have\u2026\nDS: What about the adage, \u201cThose who forget history are doomed to repeat it\u201d?\nDS: Don\u2019t you think Darfur is repetition?\nDS: Like Dubai?\nDS: A criticism of the Arab states is that back in the 1990s they had squandered the wealth that they were making on the high oil price because they had not invested it wisely. It seems that that has changed, that the Arabs are creating these new wealth funds and that much of the money that is generated in the Middle East is now coming from Arab states. Are you worried that Israel will become increasingly marginalized in the Middle East? Right now it\u2019s very Iraq War focused or Iran-focused or the Emirates around the Gulf with their money.\nIs Israel a united society?\nDS: As you know, I\u2019m part of a group from a technology mission over here of journalists. We went to Meytav, your largest technology incubator, and spoke with their Vice President Norman Sandberg. One of the things that he raised as an issue is that Israeli society is becoming dichotomized between Tel Aviv and the rest of the country. How do you develop the brainpower without Israel becoming a city-state with Tel Aviv? Mr. Sandberg told us nobody wants to go to the North. They want to stay in Tel Aviv. They don\u2019t want to actually spread out and work on developing the rest of the country and invest outside of there. Is that a problem that you foresee that this bubble is forming around Tel Aviv in terms of brainpower?\nDS: When you speak of language, Hebrew is very unique. At a time when languages are disappearing, Hebrew is the only example that I know of a language revived successfully. Although I don\u2019t speak Hebrew, I understand that the quality of Hebrew spoken by the younger generations has decreased.\n\"'DS: You used to not want to see the legs. [\"Laughs\"]\nDS: What informs the question I asked about Hebrew is that it seems to build such a cohesive society here in Israel. It\u2019s one of the binding forces...\nDS: One value used to be military service. 20 years ago it was anathema to not serve in the military and that was another binding cohesive force in Israeli society and now it\u2019s quite common...\nDS: Do you think Israel\u2019s security is at a point where it can move from being concerned with military service to being unconcerned and moving more towards competition in sports or the creative elements?\nIran: will Israel strike first?\nDS: With Iran, do you think that Israel would ever need to act unilaterally again, to make a strike, in response to their nuclear capabilities? The U.S. National Intelligence Estimate, which is quite controversial, said that they\u2019ve stopped their nuclear weapons program, yet there are many centrifuges in Natanz that are still producing material.\nDS: Are you saying the Iranian people will be the agents of change?\nDS: But there was so much hope for Mohammad Khatami and yet his administration ended up a disappointment--\nDS: But the Iranian people seem to be rallying around their nuclear program.\nDS: As part of a coalition?\nDS: And you feel it would be a mistake for Israel to act unilaterally, or not?\nDS: You don\u2019t feel America plays that role with Israel?\nDS: Although they face it quite often in Iraq and Afghanistan.\nThe 2006 Lebanon War.\nDS: How did the Lebanese War help Israel\u2019s security?\nDS: Do you think it\u2019s hurt the peace process, the Lebanese War?\nDS: Do you think there is still a strong peace movement in Israel?\nOn American politics.\nDS: How have you seen America\u2019s role in the peace process change between Clinton to Bush?\nDS: You earlier spoke about modernity and the importance of science and how a lot of the terrorists are very scared of modernity and how it will affect their traditions yet one of Israel\u2019s greatest supporters are the evangelicals in America, who are often seen in America as fighters of science and modernity.\nDS: Mitt Romney\nPeres on his Presidency and learning from the future, not the past.\nDS: What do you hope to achieve with your presidency?\nDS: Do you hope to have another term as president?\n\"'DS: [\"Laughs\"] I think you are already seen as both of those things.\nDS: It is unique that when you look at your standing 20 years ago versus now, it\u2019s so different--\n\"'DS: [\"Laughs\"] Well...\nDS: What do you look at as your greatest legacy in your career?\n\"'DS: What pops into your head right away when I asked that? [\"Laughs\"]\nDS: You don\u2019t speak to your children about the things you\u2019ve done in you life or your grandchildren?\nDS: They probably know Wikipedia.\nDS: You\u2019re very unique in your generation but also in Israel as someone who\u2019s saying \u201cListen to the younger people.\u201d Wikipedia is something that was basically built by people under 30 and it\u2019s become perhaps the most influential media in the\u2014\nDS: Mr. President, I think that that is advice that many of our presidential candidates could heed as much as any young person.

Upon this then he also added the President (Kibaki) has also asked him to invite the president of Ghana that is President Kufuor of Ghana to be there to help calm the situation. This is what was said yesterday that President Kufuor is going to Kenya to talk to the two leadership and then make them come to if you like some the peace pipe so that things in Kenya will calm down so that of course the necessary things could be done, and then ensure that people go about their normal businesses,\u201d he said."}

Two men, Ralph Baze and , who were convicted of murder in the Commonwealth of Kentucky and sentenced to death, sued the state in 2004 arguing that the use of lethal injection as a method of imposition of capital punishment violates the Eighth Amendment's prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment. \nThirty-seven states and the Federal Government have capital punishment for some crimes, all except Nebraska (which uses electrocution) use lethal injection. The process uses three chemicals in a \"cocktail\", which, by the procedures that are used to apply them to the condemned, (three injections given consecutively) allegedly \"create a significant and unnecessary risk of inflicting severe pain that could be prevented by the adoption of reasonable safeguards\", their lawyers said in court papers. \"Kentucky seeks to execute in a relatively humane manner and has worked hard to adopt such a procedure,\" Kentucky Attorney General Gregory Stumbo has said. The state has also argued in its brief against supporting the plaintiffs' appeal that it will lead to \"an endless road of litigation. ... Condemned inmates will never run out of ideas for changes to the procedures, drugs or equipment used during lethal injection.\"\nBaze was scheduled to be executed on January 8 after Governor of Kentucky Ernie Fletcher signed his death warrant, but the Kentucky Supreme Court suspended his execution on September 12, 2007, arguing it needed more time to examine arguments he had made in a separate appeal. He was convicted of killing Powell County Sheriff Steve Bennett and Deputy Arthur Briscoe in 1992 while the lawmen were trying to serve him with arrest warrants. Bowling was convicted of killing Edward and Tina Earley in Louisville in 1990. \nAccording to the article on lethal injection in Wikipedia, the three chemicals used are Sodium thiopental to render the offender unconscious; Pancuronium/Tubocurarine: to stop all muscle movement except the heart, causing muscle paralysis, collapse of the diaphragm, and would eventually cause death by asphyxiation; and Potassium chloride to stop the heart. The chemicals apparently cannot be combined together as they could precipitate into a solid and be ineffective. It is argued that thiopental is a very short-term anesthetic and may wear off during the procedure, causing anesthesia awareness and excruciating pain from the effects of the other drugs.\nIn oral hearings today, the justices seemed skeptical that the chemical concoction causes extreme pain or that a better method was available. A lawyer for one of the plaintiffs argued that if insufficient anesthetic is given, when the inmate is given the paralyzing drug, they will experience agonizing pain, but be unable to react, and that it is even illegal in Kentucky to euthanize animals in this fashion. Some of the justices have considered sending the case back for further hearings to determine if a single barbiturate would be superior to the current method.\nWhile the Supreme Court has examined the application of the death penalty many times over the past 40 years, this is the first time the court has reviewed the issue of the method of execution in 100 years, according to lawyers for the plaintiffs. A ruling is not expected until June. There are about 3,000 people on death row in the United States, and about 60 are executed each year. Since the case was accepted by the Supreme Court, all executions in the United States have been temporarily suspended pending the decision.\nThe case name is \"Baze v. Rees\"."}

In this case, it\u2019s an early omen of solar storms that will gradually increase over the next few years,\" said solar physicist Douglas Biesecker of National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\u2019s (NOAA) Space Weather Prediction Center.\nThe new sunspot, identified as #10,981, is the latest visible spot to appear since NOAA began numbering them on January 5, 1972. Its high-latitude location at 27 degrees North, and its negative polarity leading to the right in the Northern Hemisphere are clear-cut signs of a new solar cycle, according to NOAA experts. The first active regions and sunspots of a new solar cycle can emerge at high latitudes while those from the previous cycle continue to form closer to the equator.\nThe sunspot has been reported by several observatories, confirming this is the first spot which developed into a visible sunspot group. SpaceWeather.com reported that it produced auroras on Jan. 5th. \"It was a nice flowing display that persisted for an hour and a half,\" reports photographer Calvin Hall of Palmer, Alaska.\nA sunspot is an area of highly organized magnetic activity on the surface of the sun. The new 11-year cycle is expected to build gradually, with the number of sunspots and solar storms reaching a maximum by 2011 or 2012, though devastating storms can occur at any time."}

NZA1 left the tarmac traveling at around 270\u00a0km/h, whereas Black Beauty had just sped past at 300\u00a0km/h.\nIn the second race, Black Beauty managed to win despite having a slower start due to surface water on the runway. But water was not too much of a problem because the track was straight, Mr Reid says.\nBlack Beauty was not able to reach its top speed due to a speed limiter being required for A1GP races.\nPrior to the commencement of the first race, Captain Morgan said that the biggest challenge he faces is trying to keep NZA1 on the ground due to less fuel than normally on a test flight, and no passengers.\nAuckland International Airport managed to accommodate the race while just adjusting scheduled times and keeping the rest of the airport fully functional after being approached with the deal six-months ago. The airport has never closed since opening 42-years ago.\nThe stunt was used for promotion of the next race, to be held on January 20 at Taupo, New Zealand.

The talks are supposed to lead to the formation of a Palestinian state by the end of this year. However, neither side said when the talks would start. \nTalks between the two sides have been bogged down since last November's Annapolis, Maryland Mideast peace conference, with Palestinians angry over continued Israeli settlement expansion in East Jerusalem and the West Bank, and Israelis angry over continued Palestinian militant attacks. \nMahdi Abdel Hadi who heads the Palestinian research group PASSIA says both Mr. Olmert and Mr. Abbas are politically weakened, and it is unlikely either man can probably give the other what he wants. \n\"I think both leaders, Olmert and Abbas are weak, vis-\u00e0-vis their constituencies,\" he explained. \"It is what they can deliver to their own societies.

The plane crashed into frigid waters a short distance from the runway, killing six of the ten on board, including the pilot, and leaving the other four hospitalized.\nThe US National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) is investigating the accident, and NTSB investigator Clint Johnson said \"There have been some incidents and accidents that did result from the door coming open. We don't know yet if there are similarities.\" He refused to speculate on accident cause, pointing out that a full investigation would take some time to complete.\nThe remains of the fuselage have been laid out in a maintenance hangar close to the Kodiak Island accident site and is scheduled for examination tomorrow pending arrival of an accident investigation representative from Piper, who will provide detailed technical assistance. The nine-passenger complement had chartered the Servant Air plane to fly to Homer, and represented maximum capacity for the twin-engined plane.\nIt appears that the survivors were seated at the rear of the plane. The deceased were identified as pilot Robin Starrett, 50, of Kodiak and five Homer residents - Stefan F. Basargin, 36, Pavel F. Basargin, 30, Zahary F. Martushev, 25, Iosif F. Martushev, 15, and Andrian Reutov, 22. The survivor's names have now also been released; they are Karnely Ivanov, 32, of Anchor Point, Feodot Basargin, 33, of Anchorage, Anton Rijkoff, 30, of Anchorage, and Andrean Basargin, 25, of Homer.\nThere have been two previous cases of Alaskan Piper Navajo crashes confirmed to have been caused by open forward cargo hatches. In April 1990 a compartment opened during takeoff from Deadnight; this caused separation of an engine cover which proceeded to strike and damage the horizontal stabilizer. No-one was injured.\nIt was discovered that a vital spring designed to exert pressure and thus keep the door shut was missing; the operator had improvised its own device to shut the door without correctly locking it.\nThe second crash occurred in May 1996. A Cape Smythe Air Services owned-and-operated aircraft attempting takeoff at Point Hope had its forward door unexpectedly open as the nose lifted off. Cargo went through the left propeller, forcing an emergency crash landing on the ice severely injuring two people. \nThe pilot had loaded the hold and then visually inspected the door. Under the false impression that it had been secured properly he proceeded to takeoff. He had originally attempted to turn the aircraft around and told the NTSB he had thought that the aircraft should have been able to fly despite the open door, although he appreciated aircraft documentation did not specifically mention such conditions.\nSmall, local-based Servant Air had been operating the 1979 aircraft since 2004 without any difficulties. As with many such carriers, the pilot is responsible for loading and checking the door. The door is approximately 3 1/2 feet wide and 2 1/2 feet high."}

In the video, which was shot from the USS Hopper, and runs for some four minutes, shows the speedboats racing at the US ships. In the audio, a warning said to come from the Iranians can be heard: \"I am coming at you; you will explode.\" Near the end of the footage, the Americans issue their own warning to change course or become \"subject to defensive measures.\"\nTuesday, U.S. President George W. Bush called the actions of the Iranians a \"provocative act\":\n\"My message today to the Iranians is they shouldn't have done what they did. It is a dangerous situation. They should not have done it, pure and simple. . . . I don't know what their thinking was, but I'm telling you what my thinking was. I think it was a provocative act,\" said Bush during a press conference in the White House's Rose Garden today.\nThe boats disappeared a short time later, just as the U.S. ships were preparing to open fire on the vessels.\nIran claims that their troops may not have recognized the ships as being from the U.S. and says that the incident is \"normal\" for both nations.\n\"That is something normal that takes place every now and then for each party,\" said Mohammed Ali Hosseini, a spokesman for the Foreign ministry in Tehran.\nFurther, Iran claims that the footage released by the Pentagon is just a part of a propaganda campaign. \"The footage released by the US Navy are file pictures and the audio has been fabricated,\" Revolutionary Guard sources said on Iranian TV."}

Like many e-mails, the document is a chain of forwards, replies, and attachments. The attached Portable Document Format (PDF) file was from a PowerPoint presentation, entitled \"Wikimedia Foundation: Past, Present, and Future\". The presentation is watermarked confidential, do not distribute, and details the Foundation's recent financial, technical, and traffic history, outlines near-term forecasts for all three, and makes suggestions for slightly longer horizons as well. By itself the document led to several inter-connected news stories.\nWikimedia Foundation approaches donors.\nSue Gardner was, in part, hired to find innovative routes to secure funding for the Foundation. What is interesting in this case is who she approached, and with whom.\nThis presentation was used during a meeting with Sun Microsystems. Sun has long been a supporter of Wikimedia, and has previously offered hardware and financial support. A loan of a Niagara machine allowed performance testing, which showed that hardware and software setup was not suitable for the Wikimedia environment which existed at the time, but both Wikimedia's environment and Sun's hardware and software have changed since those tests.\nGardner's delegation included Roger McNamee, a technology financier with Elevation Partners among other connections to Silicon Valley's investors and visionaries.\nThe document does not explain the details of the meeting, but mentions donation proposals for short term and long term. \"In general, I don't want to have a conversation with the media (even friendly media!) about meetings we have with other organizations, until and unless there is something worth talking about,\" Ms Gardner replied to an e-mail inquiry regarding the presentation.\nMediawiki technology.\nThe software which underpins the Foundation's projects is constantly being developed, both from within and from third parties. Mediawiki is an open source software package, one with a significant share in its market; efforts to add functionality often have their own development projects and timelines. The presentation outlined some of these efforts and their respective timelines. \nOther technologies were also shown in the presentation, but these specific examples show some of the types of projects and their ambitious initial completion dates.\nKaltura collaborative video.\nSome of these technologies are joint ventures with commercial entities, such as the \"Kaltura widget\"extension designed to support collaborative video on the Mediawiki platform. The code for this project is promised to be open sourced, and the main page of the Kaltura site has a link to sourceforge, but the http://sourceforge.net/projects/kaltura/ cvs is currently empty though it is marked to be GPL. An inquiry into the current output of the extension finds it is embeding a flash object into the output. The special page allowing video editing was not operational after creating a user account (8 Jan 2008). The Wikimedia Foundation is expected to release an announcement regarding this project on January 14, however the current Kaltura extension, which requires proprietary flash and Kaltura's proprietary server, won't be used on Wikimedia sites.\n\"The Wikimedia Foundation is strongly committed to open source, open formats, sustainability, and privacy,\" said , Wikimedia Foundations Chief Technical Officer. \"We're excited to see Kaltura working towards making their collaborative video editing system open source and more compatible with the open world, and look forward to further work in that area. The initial version of Kaltura's extension for MediaWiki is an early demonstration, and will not be used on Wikimedia's web sites.\"\nAn enthusiastic version of what was intended to be a joint announcement appeared for a time on the Kaltura website. At 13:29 on January 8, the page read, \"The Wikimedia Foundation, and Kaltura, Inc. announced on _____ that the companies have joined forces to bring rich-media collaboration to Wikipedia. With the launch of this joint venture, users have been invited to test new functionality that will enable Wikipedia articles to include collaboratively created video, audio, animations, and slideshows as well as text and images. You are invited to experiment with this functionality at this Wiki, as well as at wikiducator.org/____.\"\nFlagged revisions.\nOther projects have been initiated from within the Wikimedia communities. The extension developed from the German Wikipedia community's desire to have an approved version of an article being the default view, with registered editors able to choose whether to see the default view or the most recent revision. The code is primarily developed and maintained by Aaron Schulz and Joerg Baach on Wikimedia's SVN server. Quality.wikimedia.org and the external site wikixp.org/qa are involved in testing the extension and the concept implementation.\nFlagged revisions allow the community to display versions of an article which have not been vandalised and do not contain misinformation. It is a part of several efforts to improve the quality of Wikipedia articles, spearheaded by the German Wikipedia. The German model is two-tiered, with a subset of users being able to select a \"sighted version\" or a \"validated version\". The former have been examined primarily for vandalism and simple accuracy, while the latter would involve an in-depth review of the article's content and quality.\nThe initial 1.0 release of the extension was in the first half of 2007, and it continues under active development as testing at the beta stages goes forward. Community models for its implementation have not yet been finalized, and they would be needed for every project and language.\nForecasts and financials.\nIn addition to discussing technical forecasts, future expenditures were given general forecasts and a breakdown of salary growth were presented based on pre-audit details.\nCosts between June 2007 and June 2008 were predicted to double, from US$2,650,000 to US$5,700,000 (normalized). The largest growth is expected in salaries as the Foundation undergoes re-organization and fills long-vacant positions, tripling the 2007 payroll.\nFlorence Nibart-Devouard, current Chair of the Board of Trustees of the Wikimedia Foundation, expressed pleasure at discovering the projections. \"We have not [had] a complete financial picture for some time. It was requested of Carolyn while she was employed with us[, and] it was one of the priorities for Sue Gardner to give quarterly updates, but these did not happen yet because there is so much to do,\" she said during a phone interview on 7 Jan. \"\u2026 The board did not request these projections, but I think it should be a good idea if they were informed of them. Especially when we prepare next year's budget, in April or May.\"\nThe Foundation's Chief Operations Officer, Carolyn Doran, resigned in July 2007. Although Ms Gardner was hired in July, Board member , former treasurer, provided financial information to the board through much of 2007."}

The rest of the tribes have remained silent.\nThe central figure the movement has been Canupa Gluha Mani, a longtime activist whose tactics have led repeatedly to his arrest and imprisonment \u2014 most recently in June 2007, when Canupa Gluha Mani was one of six arrested who participated in blockading a road in Nebraska to keep outside alcohol from entering his where it is banned. \"Wikinews\" talked to Canupa Gluha Mani about the movement and Lakota Oyate in an exclusive interview.\nAlso called Duane Martin Sr, Canupa Gluha Mani prefers to be referred to as just that, \"Canupa Gluha Mani\"; it means \"He walks as he protects the pipe\", though much of the meaning is lost in translation between English and the delicately-nuanced Lakota language. Canupa Gluha Mani prefers to speak in this, his native tongue \u2014 he \"hates\" that the English language has become the everyday language of the Lakota, and decries the extinction of many indigenous American languages \u2014 but uses English fluently and earthily.\nCanupa Gluha Mani talked about the Cante Tenza, the Strong Heart Warrior Society, which he heads and which forms the paramilitary force of Lakotah. The society, an \"okolakiciye\" or warrior society, originated in the . He told the following story: Four warriors in the hills ran across a and gave it chase. And as the coyote ran he turned into a Lakota man, and in his changing the man left four objects: a rattle, a drum, a lance, and a with which the Lakota people could be defended. Canupa Gluha Mani is a warrior leader, and his position with relation to the treaty council which traditionally governs the Lakota is \"whip-man\", loosely \"sergeant at arms\" \u2014 that is, he enforces order and decorum when passions grow heated during tribal discussions.\nThe authority of the Lakota Freedom Delegation, he says, comes not from the -recognized governments but rather from the \"people who understand treaties\", i.e. the treaty council, from among the Seven Sister Bands of the Lakota. This traditional government is based on the idea of \"staying quiet and listening to the people who have answers\", the \"itacans\" or expert headmen.\nCanupa Gluha Mani also endorsed Naomi Archer, who has acted as Lakota Oyate's liaison; indeed, as the Lakota Freedom Delegation prepared its trip to Washington DC he called in Naomi Archer, who though of non-native extraction is his adopted sister and a fellow Cante Tenza member, to handle media support. \"I support the understandings of what she's saying\", he said, referring to a previous interview with Archer which revealed an apparent split between and other members of the Lakota Freedom Delegation. \"She as an individual has integrity.\" However, the previous interview missed nuances and the perceived gap between Lakota Oyate and Russell Means' Republic of Lakota is not so great. \"There's no division here...it's communication, that's all. We can always get past this.\"\nWith regard to Russell Means, who has declared himself Chief Facilitator of the , he said, \"I've worked with my uncle Russell Means in positive venues. And I'm still behind him, I have love for him;\" He emphasized the familial bond between himelf and Means, noting that Means had adopted him as a nephew. However, \"the Lakota have to be recognized.\" It was \"genocide\", he said, that of all the races of humanity, American Indians are not represented at the United Nations.\nOn the subject of Lakota activist Alfred Bone Shirt, who organized the Lakota Oyate's first freedom celebration and information meeting on Saturday, 5 January but has since made comments attacking the legitimacy of Canupa Gluha Mani, Naomi Archer and Lakota Oyate, Canupa Gluha Mani had this to say. \"I have nothing to do with Mr Bone Shirt, nothing against him\". He also noted that Lakota Oyate had respected Bone Shirt's call to take down invitations for donations, but expressed a wish that Mr Bone Shirt would make the same call to any other website inviting donations to Lakotah.\nThe traditional decision making process within the Lakota, he said, was informal discussions among the women of the Lakota rather than pronouncements and declarations. Ideas like western forms of government \u2014 referencing the \"Republic\" \u2014 and the use of the English language were part of the reason for both the misunderstanding of the dispute between Russell Means and Canupa Gluha Mani and the Lakota's problems: \"It's hard for Indian people to adapt to this modern lifestyle...It's white teaching that cause Indian problem...leave us alone...This country has not learned a thing about its own First Nations people.\"\nUS governing of Lakota has led directly to the economic and social decline of the Lakotah people, he argues. Canupa Gluha Mani noted that the life expectancy for Lakota men is only 44, and that alcohol and drug use are epidemic, as are infectious diseases such as tuberculosis. But revival of the Lakota has to be not just economic to improve the circumstances of the people, but cultural too: \"Our language is at stake right now\" but the US government-backed institutions like the Tribal Police are just \"the second coming of the white man's cavalry\".\nCanupa Gluha Mani is on record as saying in a previous interview that \"we'll probably get killed for\" withdrawing from the United States. Now, he is tight-lipped on the future, and when asked about the possibility of a confrontation with the US will only say that \"anything's plausible.\" \nAnd if the United States government leaves the Lakota alone? \"Then we can take our practices forward in good will.\" Canupa Gluha Mani, who is married to a woman of European descent, says that the traditional American Indian lifestyle can coexist with the western lifestyle, but \"every wound has to heal\". \"We can be self-sufficient. We can govern ourselves.\" Having withdrawn from the outstanding treaties with the United States, will Lakota Oyate make a new arrangement with Washington? \"That has yet to be exonerated.\" Lakotah continues to seek international recognition; although no country has declared recognition for Lakotah, he is \"confident with the Bolivians\" and also noted a positive response from the \"Bulgarian freedom fighters\" pressuring the US to recognize Lakota independence.\nCanupa Gluha Mani then addressed the Lakota people directly. \"What needs to get out there is, I love my people...This is your dream come true. That's what the symbolic meaning of Lakotah is. It's called freedom. \"Hoka hay.\"\""}

The decision made by the Chinese Cabinet, the State Council, is intended to reduce the amount of plastic bags used in China, currently being estimated at three billion per day. The State Council also announced that at the same time as the ban, the manufacturing, sale and even use of very thin plastic bags, which are defined as being under 0.025mm thick, will be banned. Any company that does not follow this ban can be fined. \nThe ban of free plastic bags and complete ban on very thin bags will, the government hopes, help reduce the amount of crude oil used for plastic packaging, which is currently at five million tonnes per year according to \"Times Online\". The notice issued by the Chinese government said: \u201cWe should encourage people to return to carrying cloth bags, using baskets for their vegetables.\u201d\nThe People's Republic of China is not the first country to ban or restrict plastic shopping bags and the notice names Uganda and South Africa according to \"CNN\".

Still, many of the world's leading polluting countries, including the United States of America, have not yet introduced any legislation intended to reduce the usage of plastic bags.

Bush set foot on Israeli soil for the first time in his presidency.\nFollowing a discussion with Ehud Olmert, the Israeli Prime Minister, George Bush said he would provide pressure if necessary. He made this clear by saying \"If there needs to be a little pressure then you know I will provide it,\" after the talks.\nHe spoke of the strong ties between the United States and Israel. He says the source of that strength is a shared belief in the power of human freedom.\n\"We will do more than defend ourselves. We will seek lasting peace. We see a new opportunity for peace here in the Holy Land and for freedom across the region,\" said Mr. Bush.\nLike President Bush, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert kept his comments at the arrival ceremony broad in nature, avoiding any direct reference to issues related to the peace process.\n\"From the very beginning, your policies have reflected a basic understanding of the challenges facing Israel in this troubled region and a solid commitment to our national security,\" he said.\nIt fell to Israeli President Shimon Peres, who is considered by some to be largely ceremonial, to offer some tougher talk.

Among them: the borders of a future Palestinian state, competing claims to Jerusalem, and the status of Palestinian refugees.\nConcerns about rocket attacks into Israel from Gaza and Israeli settlement activity have created tensions since the American-led Annapolis Mideast conference in November. President Bush is expected to use his trip to encourage both sides to look at the big picture and keep focused on the need for peace.\nDuring the flight to Israel, White House National Security Advisor Stephen Hadley told reporters traveling with the president that Mr. Bush is not coming to the Middle East to interject himself into the negotiations. He said, instead, the president wants both sides to stay focused, and look beyond what he called \"a lot of distractions.\"\nHadley also talked about the recent incident involving Iranian vessels and U.S. Navy ships in the Persian Gulf.

Solar Films produced the film in co-operation with Northern Film, Media Foundation POEM and the North Finland Film Commission.\nOulu is considered a good choice for the premiere, as it has a reputation amongst Finns as the \"film-friendly town up north\" and because Dark Floors was filmed there over the course of summer 2007. 5,000 people are expected to attend the premiere and accompanying show.

It has also been banned by France and Spain, and has run into some service and license problems abroad, making it unavailable in the Netherlands, South America and Canada while it has not officially been banned in any of these regions.\nThe station was launched by Hezbollah in 1991 with the help of Iranian funds. By 2004, Al Manar was estimated to hold 10-15 million viewers daily worldwide. Critics claim al-Manar's agenda is influenced by Iran by virtue of the \"significant portion\" of Hezbollah's budget shortfall that is covered by Iran, via some of the \"100 and $200 million a year\" Iran provides to Hezbollah itself. Al-Manar officials strongly deny this, saying they are subsidized by the Hezbollah party and donations from other Muslims, not by Iran. Al-Manar calls itself the \"Station of the Resistance\" (qanat al-muqawama) and is a key player in what Hezbollah calls its \" against the enemy\"\n\"It's a war. Al-Manar is Hezbollah's main communication tool, through which it spreads anti-Israeli, anti-Semitic, and anti-American incitement. It spreads Hezbollah and Iranian values of radical Islam,\" Dr. Reuven Erlich said. Erlich is the head of the Terrorism Information Center in , Israel. He added that the fact that Al-Manar can now be seen in south-east Asia, means that Indonesia and Malaysia, two countries with a large Muslim population, are open to its messages of hatred.\nThaicom said it is considering its response and will only offer a formal reaction over the weekend adding the decision to transmit Al-Manar broadcasts was a \"purely business decision, which had nothing to do with politics.\""}

President Abbas has appointed a caretaker government in the West Bank that has received widespread recognition, and he resumed peace negotiations with Israel.\nOne of Mr. Abbas' senior negotiators in talks with the Israelis is Saeb Erekat.

It was three people.\"\n\" and Duane Martin [Canupa Gluha Mani] and that lady [Phyllis Young], they do not speak for the nation. You've got to have consensus\" among the eight tribes of the Lakota, he said, which the Lakota Freedom Delegation has not obtained. Mr. Hand stated that he was speaking as a tribal delegate with the consensus of the Oglala Treaty Delegation and his chief, .\nHand furthermore called the treaty withdrawal event a \"publicity stunt\" and that furthermore the 1974 meeting was not authorization to act on behalf of the Lakota people. While Means, Canupa Gluha Mani, and the rest of the delegation \"have free speech\" and can do as they wish, he said, the Elders of Lakota \"stated that they should remove themselves from treaty territory,\" that is, the Reservations inhabited by the Lakota. But \"they're still living here\" (Canupa Gluha Mani has been residing in , North Carolina since the treaty withdrawal press conference on December 19).\nWhen asked if the above decisions represented the consensus of the whole Treaty Council, Hand stated, \"we all do the same because we're all fullbloods. We all speak our own language.\"\nHand went on to explain, though, that the Treaty Council was planning to reconsider the Lakota's arrangement with the United States government. The Treaty Council of all eight Lakota tribes, which will meet on 28\u201330 January 2008, will consider whether to \"sit down to negotiate\" with the federal government. Members of the Lakota Freedom Delegation are expected to take part in that meeting. European-Americans, Hand said, are \"not honoring\" the which connected the Lakota to the United States, and noted that the Lakota were the only people to \"conquer\" the United States during the of the 19th century.\nThe arrangement with the United States, which he called a \"contract\", \"handcuffs us through the federal programs\". On their own, Hand said, \"if we rely on a sovereign nation as a nation, relating to other nations with our economic development I think we can survive.\" Hand noted that one possibility under consideration was asserting the right to negotiate independently of the US government with foreign powers in areas such as airport access rights. The Lakota, he said, would charge foreign airlines half what the United States charges to make use of airports on Lakota soil. \"We can be well off,\" he argued.\nIn another contradiction of the Lakota Freedom Delegation's program, Hand said that the Treaty Delegations \"don't want technology on our reservation\". One of his concerns was environmentalism. People of European descent are \"taking too much out of Mother Earth\", he said, making reference to ongoing environmental effects of uranium mining which has long been a contentious issue on the Lakota reservations. The Treaty Delegation's goal, he said, is \"preserving the land and animals and letting the water remain free.\"\nHowever, one of the plans of the Lakota Freedom Delegation is to install renewable energy technology on tribal land, such as solar and wind farms. This follows projects in the past, whereby wind turbines were erected on the Rosebud Reservation. Such projects would lessen dependence on foreign energy sources, as well as coincide with the Lakota's traditional respect for the environment.\nHand also expressed hope for ethnic solidarity among the non-European peoples of the world. \"All the people of color in this world will go for unity and understanding and peace\" if they overthrow the Europeans and establish their own governments, he said."}

Although Baghdad sometimes sees hail and sleet, snow has never been seen in living memory.\nSnow was also recorded in the western and central parts of the country, where it is also very unusual, and in the Kurdish north, which is mountainous and commonly sees snowfall.\nA statement by the meteorology department read \"Snow has fallen in Baghdad for the first time in about a century as a result of two air flows meeting. The first one was cold and dry and the second one was warm and humid. They met above Iraq.\"\nDawood Shakir, director of the meteorology department, told \"AFP\" his take on the causation of the snow: \"It's very rare. Baghdad has never seen snow falling in living memory. These snowfalls are linked to the climate change that is happening everywhere. We are finding some places in the world which are warm and are supposed to be cold.\"\nTemperatures in some parts of the country fell below freezing, compared to winters that are normally mild in a climate that sees summer temperatures of 120 degrees Fahrenheit. Snow fell in the capital city from prior to dawn until just after 9 a.m. local time. The flakes failed to provide a covering of snow, instead melting quickly. However, many local people still had positive things to say about the once in a lifetime event.\nMohammed Abdul-Hussein, a 63-year-old in retirement, commented \"For the first time in my life I saw a snow-rain like this falling in Baghdad. When I was young, I heard from my father that such rain had fallen in the early '40s on the outskirts of northern Baghdad but snow falling in Baghdad in such a magnificent scene was beyond my imagination.\"\nFawzi Karim, who runs a small restaurant in Hawr Rajab, six miles from Baghdad said \"I asked my mother, who is 80, whether she'd ever seen snow in Iraq before, and her answer was no... This is so unusual, and I don't know whether or not it's a lesson from God,\" while college student Talib Haider said \"a friend of mine called me at 8 a.m. to wake me up and tell me that the sky is raining snow. I rushed quickly to the balcony to see a very beautiful scene. I tried to film it with my cell phone camera. This scene has really brought me joy. I called my other friends and the morning turned out to be a very happy one in my life.\"\nResident Aysar Khaled told \"Reuters\" \"I woke up and I saw snow falling, so I woke up all the family and told them to come and see the snowfall. Everyone in Baghdad is delighted because this is a new thing, this is the first time that it snows in Baghdad... The view is very beautiful.\"\nSome viewed it as a sign of impending peace, or at least of an improving situation in the war-torn country. Hassan Zahar, a 60-year-old resident, said \"It is the first time we've seen snow in Baghdad. We've seen sleet before, but never snow. I looked at the faces of all the people, they were astonished... A few minutes ago, I was covered with snowflakes. In my hair, on my shoulders. I invite all the people to enjoy peace, because the snow means peace.\"\nThe snow was \"a new sign of the new Iraq,\" according to traffic policeman Murtadha Fadhil, who spoke to \"Reuters\" whilst sheltering under a balcony. \"It's a sign of hope. We hope Iraqis will purify their hearts and politicians will work for the prosperity of all Iraqis.\"\nThere are no reports of any bloodshed during the time the snow was falling.\nSources.\n "}

Opposition leaders says that the vote count, which has been surrounded by allegations of rigging, was a violation of the constitution and that the courts are in Mr. Kibaki's pocket.\nFlanked by opposition presidential candidate and ODM lawmakers who won parliamentary seats, Nyongo called the vote-rigging and the government's stance a betrayal of the rights of all Kenyans.\n\"The Kibaki side does not want a just solution,\" he said. \"It is hell-bent on clinging to power regardless of the verdict of the people of Kenya.

On Thursday, Ghana President left Kenya after failing to achieve a deal between the two sides.\nPresident Kibaki has named several members of his new Cabinet despite the controversy over the vote, which international observers say appears to have been rigged. Almost all of those appointed are political allies, a fact that the opposition has said is proof of his unwillingness to compromise.\nThe government says it is committed to constructive dialogue, but opposition leader Nyongo says that is a sham.\n\"Stealing is still going on, cheating is still going on, and quite honestly, Kibaki should be embarrassed to be, embarrassed every day by the fact that he stole,\" he added. \"I don't think it's a very good sign to be a head of state who has the extra title of eminent thief.\"\nMeanwhile on Thursday, former United Nations Secretary-General was to arrive with several prominent African leaders to try to broker a compromise. Mr. Odinga's team has said it only wants talks to take place through a mediator, while President Kibaki has insisted on face-to-face negotiations."}

He said that will depend on recommendations by General Petraeus, who is due to report to Congress on that issue in March. A day earlier, the president told the NBC television network that U.S. troops could remain in Iraq for at least a decade.\nMr. Bush also called on Syria to cut what he called \"the flow of terrorists\" into Iraq. He accused Iran of supporting militias and extremist groups in Iraq, and urged it to stop.\nLater, the president addressed a crowd of some 1,500 American troops at a U.S. military base in Kuwait.\n\"The history will say, it was when you were called upon, you served, and the service you rendered was absolutely necessary to defeat an enemy overseas so we do not have to face them here at home,\" he said.\nMr.Bush said the troops were part of what he called \"an ideological struggle\" against \"cold-blooded murderers\" with a \"hateful vision of a future.\"\nIn his speech Bush said \"Iraq is now a different place from one year ago,\" and that \"we [Americans] must do all we can to ensure that 2008 will bring even greater progress\"\nHe said the best way to defeat an ideology of hate is with an ideology of hope, based on liberty.\n\"There is no doubt in my mind that we will succeed,\" he said. \"There is no doubt in my mind when history was written, the final page will say: Victory was achieved by the United States of America for the good of the world; that by doing the hard work now, we can look back and say, the United States of America is more secure, and generations of Americans will be able to live in peace.\"\nKuwait is the most pro-U.S. country in the Arab world, but even so there is deep anxiety there about some U.S. policies in the Middle East. With a large Shi'ite population and a large U.S. troop presence, Kuwait is worried about the possibility of a U.S. military strike on Iran. The emirate has said it will not allow its territory to be used in such an attack.

The disaster occurred near a busy bus station in Port Harcourt.\nPort Harcourt is located in an oil rich area, and is the central point of the Nigerian oil industry, which has a value of billions of US Dollars. It is consequently a regular target for extremists, but a police spokesman said terrorism is not believed to be a factor.\nAccording to \"CNN\", the same spokesman said a car's driver lost control whilst being chased by police, striking the tanker and triggering the explosion. However, \"AFP\" reports that the tanker itself was being chased for carrying stolen petrol, and said the vehicle overturned after hitting a barricade on a partially constructed section of road in a bid to escape. The \"Associated Press\" (\"AP\") makes no mention of a police chase, and says the lorry overturned after suffering a blowout.\nThe crash occurred at a major junction in Eleme district. Fuel was spilled over cars and shop entrances before igniting. Local shop owner Matthew Eliagwu described the disaster to \"AP\": \"I heard a loud bang and I came out of my shop. I saw fire running down towards my shop, but I escaped. It was impossible to help anyone, because I had to run for my life.\"\nAt least 15 vehicles are known to have been destroyed, ten of which were buses, as well as 20 shops. Most victims are believed to be street vendors in the vicinity of the tanker at the time. It took hours for firefighters to bring the flames under control. At present no figures are available for numbers of injuries, but at least 30 are dead.\n\"AFP\" reports that although no arrests have yet been confirmed, local residents placed the tanker's driver amongst the survivors and said he was receiving treatment in a local hospital.\nNigeria is the world's eighth-largest exporter of crude oil, although violence has caused this to be reduced by over a quarter. The Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta has claimed responsibility for a series of recent attacks, including one aimed at four ships in the - the nation's largest oil and gas terminal - and an explosion and fire yesterday on a seagoing oil tanker berthed in Port Harcourt's sea terminal.\nFuel tanker and pipeline explosions are common in Nigeria, often triggered by looters. Just eleven days ago, on January 1, another fuel tanker rolled over and caught fire in Port Harcourt, destroying dozens of shops and houses, although there were no fatalities. In March 2007 an overturned tanker in Kaduna State exploded whilst being targeted by looters, killing 93.\nAccidents are common as the country's roads are inadequately maintained, as are many of the vehicles that use them. Death tolls are often high because vendors crowd many major roadways."}

The group is demanding the prison be shut down. Meanwhile, a U.S. appeals court in Washington has ruled against four British men who allege they were tortured during their detention at Guantanamo. \nAmnesty International, the American Civil Liberties Union, and other rights organizations used the anniversary to again call on the Bush administration to close down the Guantanamo facility. A crowd of about 200 protesters, many dressed in orange jumpsuits similar to the ones worn by Guantanamo prisoners, gathered in the pouring rain in Washington, D.C. yesterday. Around 80 were thought to have been arrested, as protests are forbidden in the area surrounding the courts. Larry Cox, the Executive Director of Amnesty International USA said Guantanamo has become a symbol.\n\"It's become the symbol of everything that's wrong with the U.S. approach to fighting terror and making people safer,\" said Cox. \"It's become a symbol of human rights abuses, it's become the symbol of things which deviate so grossly from the values that this country has always upheld that people are horrified and shocked.\"\nAmnesty also staged protests Friday in the Philippines, Sweden, Paraguay, Bahrain, Ireland, and Israel. Major events included a gathering outside the American embassy in London, UK and a walking protest through the streets of Sydney, Australia\nPresident Bush and several senior members of his administration have repeatedly said they would like to close Guantanamo down, but there is the question of how to make sure the terrorist suspects detained there do not return to target the United States if handed back to their countries of origin.\nDefence Secretary Robert Gates said last month there has not been much progress in efforts to close the prison down because of legal concerns in Congress.\nAmnesty's Larry Cox says his organization has worked out an action plan to close it, which has been endorsed by lawmakers from 30 countries.\n\"There is an easy answer to this, which is to shut down Guantanamo, to put people into U.S. detention centres, to charge them if they're guilty of crimes, they should be charged, and to bring them to trial,\" said Cox. \"And to let other people, either go back, if they can, to their countries or to get asylum in other countries.\"\nDemocratic Senator Tom Harkin has introduced legislation that would close the detention centre and restore due process to the detainees, but it is not clear if and when it will come to the floor for debate.\nMeanwhile, a U.S. appeals court in Washington, D.C. has thrown out a lawsuit filed by four British ex-prisoners who say they were systematically tortured during their two-year detention at Guantanamo Bay. The four plaintiffs are all British nationals and residents, who were released from Guantanamo in 2004.\nThe U.S. Supreme Court is currently considering another case that involves other prisoners still at Guantanamo Bay and if they have a right to challenge their confinement in U.S. courts."}

Our board is working with management to look at all strategic options to remain a leader in the industry, including potential consolidation transactions. [Delta] won't provide updates on the board's process.\"\nThe airline has been in exploratory talks with both Northwest and United since late 2007, and it is believed that the purpose of the New York meeting was to select which airline offered Delta the better deal and authorise moving talks on to the next level. If a deal goes ahead and survives regulatory checks and potential opposition from politicians and consumer advocates then a merge with either airline would be the biggest between two US airlines, and would result in the biggest airline in the world.\nRapidly rising costs in the aviation industry are driving airlines towards merges. In particular, the price of jet fuel jumped 58% in 2007, driven by the rapidly increasing price of oil. When Anderson joined Delta in early September, he commented that he was not interested in potential merge deals. However, as prices rise and shares fall for airlines, he publicly changed his stance to being open to Delta-led mergers. Shares in all three companies shot up amid the news of a potential deal, although they have begun falling again, and did not hit last year's highs. Delta has a current market value of around $4.2 billion, less than half the amount US Airways offered last year in an attempt to buy Delta, which failed.\nSources.\n "}

The front edge of the cloud has already begun to hit the galaxy.\n\"The leading edge of this cloud is already interacting with gas from our Galaxy. This is most likely a gas cloud left over from the formation of the Milky Way or gas stripped from a neighbor galaxy. When it hits, it could set off a tremendous burst of star formation. Many of those stars will be very massive, rushing through their lives quickly and exploding as supernovae. Over a few million years, it'll look like a celestial New Year's celebration, with huge firecrackers going off in that region of the Galaxy,\" said Felix J. Lockman of the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO), one of the astronomers who headed a study to research the cloud. The University of Wisconsin-Whitewater also participated in the study.\nAstronomers used the Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope (GBT) to study the cloud, which was first discovered by an astronomer in 1963. The study found that as many as a million new stars, much like our own Sun, could form from the gas when it does collide with our galaxy. \nCurrently it is 8,000 light years away from full impact of our galaxy, and is traveling at over 150 miles a second. It is 2,500 light-years wide and over 11,000 light-years long. Astronomers believe it will strike the Milky Way's disk at a 45-degree angle.\nIt was earlier believed that the cloud was traveling away from the Milky Way or might have been part of the galaxy itself but, due to the technology at the time, images were not clear enough to see what was really happening. Using the highly sensitive GBT, astronomers have now been able to capture over 40,000 different images of the cloud. The researchers now believe that the cloud is, in fact, moving toward the Milky Way and pushing the gases of the galaxy up onto itself as it progresses.\n\"If you could see this cloud with your eyes, it would be a very impressive sight in the night sky. From tip to tail it would cover almost as much sky as the Orion constellation. But as far as we know it is made entirely of gas -- no one has found a single star in it,\" added Lockman."}

The Chargers' big-play defense then held on downs at its 7, and stopped Indy again in the final moments to preserve their eighth straight win.\nTo make it nine in a row and advance to their second Super Bowl -- the other was a loss to San Francisco after the 1994 season -- the Chargers will need all the resourcefulness they showed at Indianapolis. Being undermanned against undefeated New England hardly is an enticing prospect.\nStill, with All-Pro cornerback Antonio Cromartie getting an interception and fumble recovery, and linebackers Shawne Merriman and Shaun Phillips plaguing Peyton Manning, the Chargers showed they have the ability to throw off any offense. Maybe even the most prolific attack in NFL history.\nThe Chargers didn't come close against the Patriots in Week 2, falling 38-14. That was the beginning of a slide to 5-5 for San Diego, but the Chargers (13-5) are rolling now.\nIt was a gutty showing by Rivers, who threw for three scores -- he banged his right knee on a 56-yard screen pass TD by Darren Sproles to end the third quarter. And Turner, who could be a starter elsewhere but usually sits behind league rushing leader Tomlinson, gave the offense the balance it desperately needed in the late stages of the upset, rushing for 71 yards.\nThe Chargers' opportunistic defense, which led the league in takeaways (48) and turnover margin (plus-24), grabbed two interceptions -- both on tipped balls -- and a fumble. While San Diego couldn't stop Manning's offense from steadily marching downfield most of the game, it could make the key plays that get you closer to the Super Bowl.\nStill, if Tomlinson is limited or sidelined, how much chance do the Chargers have against the perfect Patriots? Not to mention perhaps missing Rivers or tight end Antonio Gates, who courageously played much of the day on a dislocated toe.\nFor the Colts (13-4), it was a bitterly quick elimination from the postseason.\nA year ago, they won three playoff games, then beat Chicago in the Super Bowl. They couldn't recapture their touch on offense or defense this time, and a defense that allowed the fewest points during the season wore down against the equally physical Chargers.\nManning did throw for 402 yards, completing 33 of his 48 throws, but both interceptions killed deep scoring threats.\nRivers was 14-of-19 for 264 yards, and Volek went 3-of-4 for 48 yards in his clutch relief role. Vincent Jackson became Rivers' top target and had seven catches for 93 yards and a score.\nScoring Summary.\n\"Note: Green indicates San Diego Score, Red indicates Indianapolis Score\""}

The team was led by Dr. Doris Taylor, director of the University's Center for Cardiovascular Repair, used a process called \"decellularization\" in which the hearts were taken from newborn rats and stripped of their cells. The resulting non-living mass, called an extracellular matrix or ECM, contains no cells and therefore will not be rejected by its new owners. New muscle and endothelial cells are then injected into the ECM and stimulated electrically.\nThe first micro-contractions occurred within two days of the new cells being injected into the ECMs and visible contractions began to occur within seven to eight days. The rat hearts beat strongly enough to pump fluid out the aorta, although the force at which they beat was only equivalent to 2 percent of a normal adult rat or about 25 percent of a 16 week old human fetus.\nThe researchers will next be testing the process of pig hearts for which ECMs have already been created. A pig heart is roughly the size of a human heart. The eventual hope of the project is to be able to use the process on human hearts taken from cadavers or pig hearts with human cells injected, though it remains to be seen whether or not the process will work on a heart from a larger animal, such as a pig or human. The team also plans to experiment with the process on other organs such as kidneys, livers and lungs."}

The action, coinciding with President Bush's visit to Saudi Arabia, is part of a broader U.S. effort to bolster Gulf allies in the face of a more assertive Iran. VOA's David Gollust reports from the State Department.\nThe Bush administration has already briefed Congress on its arms sales plans for Saudi Arabia. Monday's announcement sets in motion a 30-day period in which the House and Senate can block the plan with a joint resolution - an action that appears highly unlikely.\nUnder the proposed deal, worth more than $120 million, the United States would provide Saudi Arabia with 900 kits and associated equipment to convert conventional gravity bombs into GPS-guided smart-bombs, known as JDAMs.\nThe weapons are a mainstay of the U.S. military arsenal and their accuracy would vastly enhance the capability of the Saudi Air Force, which has top-of-the-line U.S.-made fighter-bomber aircraft.\nThe sale is part of a broader $20-billion arms package for Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states announced by Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and Defense Secretary Robert Gates last August on a mission to the Gulf, aimed at shoring up U.S. allies concerned about Iranian influence in the region.\nSeveral elements of the broader package including sales of Patriot anti-missile systems to Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates, and upgrades for Saudi Arabia's AWACS airborne command and control planes, have already gotten congressional assent. Officials here say they also expect the Saudi J-DAMS sale to proceed despite concerns expressed by some congressional supporters of Israel.\nAt the time the Gulf weapons sales package was announced last year, the Bush administration also committed to a 10-year, $30-billion arms package for Israel, representing a 25 per cent increase in annual U.S. arms aid to that country.\nBriefing reporters, State Department Spokesman Sean McCormack said the administration has assured Congress it would do nothing to upset Israel's military edge over potential enemies in the region.\n\"We've spent a lot of time assuring that we abide by our commitments to a qualitative military edge for Israel,\" said Sean McCormack. \"This is something that President Reagan first talked about and it's been reiterated and reconfirmed by each successive president after that. We're committed to maintaining that qualitative military edge for Israel.\"\nIsrael itself has not protested the pending sale. Israeli officials have said they anticipate being provided with a new-generation U.S. smart bomb more capable than J-DAMS, which have been in service for more than a decade.\nA spokesman for House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Tom Lantos, a prominent advocate for Israel in Congress, said he does not intend to push a resolution of disapproval.\nHowever one House member, New York Democrat Anthony Weiner, said he would introduce such a measure and already has more than 30 co-sponsors.\nCritics of the package have faulted Saudi Arabia's record in combating terrorism and advancing political reform. Under questioning here, Spokesman McCormack said the Saudi government has made \"quantum leaps\" in action against terrorist cells and financing in recent years and has begun the process of reform, though not necessarily at a pace that would please some critics.\nTwo-thirds majorities of the members in both houses would be required to block the sale and officials here say chances for that appear nil.

Japan's Institute of Cetacean Research (IRC) deny Sea Shepherd claims that they have been abused. The Japanese government has assured the Australian Government the release of the men.\nAccording to the conservation agency Sea Shepherd, Australian Benjamin Potts, 28, a helicopter assistant, and Briton Giles Lane, an engine room worker, were detained on board a \"Yushin Maru\" No. 2 after delivering a letter asking the ship to exit Antarctic waters .\nCaptain Paul Watson of the Sea Shepherd's vessel, \"Steve Irwin\", said that the Japanese \"tried to throw them overboard, then they tied them to a bulkhead and were beating them\". \nHe alleged that the men were tied to the radar masts before being brought below deck after which the men were not seen. Sea Shepherd's international director, Jonny Vasic, claimed that they were \"basically strapped by the arms with zip-ties and tied with rope around their chests\" for 2\u00bd to three hours.\nThe captain said he was surprised as he expected Japanese whale ships to treated his men more decently.\n\"We are concerned but I know the Australian and British governments are in touch with the Japanese government.\"\nSea Shepherd said it has photographic evidence that the whalers were abusing the men.\nHowever, the Japanese ship refuted the allegations.\n\u201cAny accusations that we have tied them up or assaulted them are completely untrue,\u201d Director-general of the IRC Minoru Morimoto said in the press release, \u201cIt is illegal to board another country\u2019s vessels on the high seas.\" \nDetaining the activists was the \"only way\", he said. \"You couldn't have them running around the deck not knowing what they're going to do.\"\nHe said that the activists were making attempts to entangle the screw and were throwing bottles of butyric acid, as rancid butter, onto the deck of the vessel before boarding the vessel. Mr Watson has confirmed this and said that they were to act as a stink bomb but their actions were still peaceful.\nHideki Moronuki, the chief of the whaling section of The Fisheries Agency of Japan, claimed that \"nobody took violent action against the two illegal intruders\".\nMr. Moronuki said that they were treated \"very, very humanely\" and were provided with \"a warm, delicious hot meal\", \"[a] warm, nice bath\" and \"[a] nice bed with clean white sheets\".\nAustralian foreign minister Stephen Smith said that the Japanese government promised him the release of the men late yesterday night.\n\"Late last night I was advised the Japanese had agreed to this and they had instructed the relevant whaling ship to return the men to the Steve Irwin,\" he told ABC radio.\nMr. Moronuki said the \"two illegal intruders\" will not be released by the vessel's captain until \"Paul Watson has accepted the conditions of the safety of the Japanese vessel\". He said he knew nothing of the comments that the Japanese government agreeing to release the men.\nMr. Watson said the Japanese were \"[holding] hostages and make demands\" and were acting like \"a terrorist organisation\". A press release said Sea Shepherd \"will not negotiate with poachers and demands that the Japanese whalers release Benjamin Potts and Giles Lane as soon as possible\".\nMr. Watson said he would not send a zodiac to collect the men as requested in an email because it \"endangers the life of the crew, to put them out in these waters in a small boat, 10 miles out of view\".\nOn Sky TV, IRC spokesman Glenn Inwood said Sea Shepherd were \"not answering phone calls or emails at this stage\" to take advantage of \"fair amount of media coverage\" but they were \"still making attempts to contact them\".\nAn Australian Federal Police spokeswoman said that Sea Shepherd made a police report at around 7:00 UTC."}

The promotional video appeared on video-sharing sites including YouTube, Gawker.com and radar online.com, and clips from the video were also shown on Wednesday morning talk shows in the United States. \nIn the 9-minute video produced by the Church of Scientology, Cruise is seen discussing his beliefs while the theme from his \"Mission: Impossible\" films plays as background music. Cruise appears wearing a black turtleneck sweater, speaking about his dedication to changing people's lives. The format of the video appears to be an interview with Cruise, and it is edited with questions cut out. Some of Cruise's responses end abruptly.\nThroughout the video, Cruise uses Scientology jargon terms such as \"KSW\": \"For me, it\u2019s all about KSW.\" The term stands for Keeping Scientology Working, which refers to a 10-point letter written by Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard in 1965 to ensure the organization's survival. Cruise also discusses \"SPs\", or Suppressive Persons, \"PTSPs\", a \"potential trouble source\" influenced by a Suppressive Person, and the need to \"confront and shatter suppression\".\nCruise makes assertions about programs which use Hubbard's teachings such as Criminon and Narconon \"We're the authorities on getting people off drugs. We're the authorities on the mind. We're the authorities on improving conditions. We can rehabilitate criminals. Way to happiness. We can bring peace and unite cultures.\" Of the manner in which he wishes to spread Scientology's message, he says \"You're in the playing field or out of the arena.\" Cruise also expresses his disdain for psychiatrists, \"Crush these guys [psychiatrists]! I've had it! Psychiatry doesn't work. No mercy! None! Go to guns!\"\nThe video concludes with Cruise laughing, and then a voiceover says: \"Scientology can be defined by a single question: would you want others to develop the knowledge you have? In answering that question, Tom Cruise has introduced LRH [L. Ron Hubbard] technology to more than 1 billion people on earth. And that is only the first wave he has unleashed. That is why the story of Tom Cruise, Scientologist, has only just begun.\" \nAccording to \"Reuters\", the Church of Scientology stated that the video was shown at a 2004 meeting of the International Association of Scientologists. In a statement, the Church of Scientology said that the video was Cruise's acceptance speech after he had been given the organization's \"Freedom Medal\", and was shown \"before an audience of 5,000 church parishioners and their guests.\" The statement also called the video that appeared on the Internet a \"pirated and edited version.\" A representative for Cruise confirmed the Church of Scientology statement: \"The video is of Mr. Cruise making an acceptance speech to fellow parishioners at a private church event in 2004.\" David Miscavige, head of the Church of Scientology, had presented Cruise with the \"Freedom Medal of Valor\" at the 2004 ceremony. Eighty Scientologists have received the \"Freedom Medal\" since the award's establishment in 1985, but Cruise is the only recipient of the Freedom Medal of Valor. Andrew Morton's \"Tom Cruise: An Unauthorized Biography\" characterizes Cruise as the second most powerful individual within the organization.\nThe video first appeared on the Internet on Sunday, and disappeared after the footage was linked to from Gawker.com and The Huffington Post. Gawker.com posted a copy of the video Tuesday morning, and said that the video had \"been passed around privately by reporters and writers investigating Cruise's ties to Scientology.\" Gawker.com noted that a smaller video clip which had previously been available on YouTube \"is no longer available, most likely after the Church of Scientology sent in a copyright infringement notice.\" Gawker.com has stated that the video will stay up on its site, and has reprinted correspondence with Ava Paquette, an attorney with Moxon &amp; Kobrin, a law firm representing the Church of Scientology. Nick Denton of Gawker.com commented on the posting of the video \"It's newsworthy, and we will not be removing it.\"\nInvestigative journalist Mark Ebner is helping to post more than two hours of additional footage related to the Cruise video, and called it \"the most unintentionally hilarious footage you've ever seen,\" and characterized it as \"better than\" when Cruise jumped on Oprah's couch during a May 23, 2005 appearance on \"The Oprah Winfrey Show\", and the \"South Park\" parody of Cruise in the controversial episode \"Trapped in the Closet\". Ebner appeared on \"The Today Show\" on Wednesday, and discussed the video's appearance on the Internet. In response, the Church of Scientology called Ebner a \"fraud\". Ebner told the \"New York Daily News\" that \"These tapes were made for purposes of recruitment.\"\nAttempts by the Church of Scientology to stop distribution of the video via the Internet \"seem to have backfired spectacularly,\" according to \"The Press Association\", and by Thursday the video was viewable on websites other than Gawker.com, including the \"New York Post\", Independent Television News and the BBC. For websites based in Britain usage of the video is protected under copyright laws, specifically for reporting news and current affairs. Still other reports on the video linked to locations where it could be watched, including a report in \"The Times\". Copies of the video were not available on Google Video on Thursday, but were still available on YouTube.\nAttorney Mark Stephens of London-based firm Finers Stephens Innocent commented on the Church of Scientology's attempts to remove the video from the Internet: \"The Scientologists, by taking action to enforce their copyrights, have made it a news story. The mistake was not to foresee that a news story has special protection in copyright law in reporting news and current events.\""}

A coalition of Native American tribal leaders, fishermen, farmers, various governmental agencies, and environmental groups developed the proposal after two-years of negotiations. \nThe project would cost an estimated $1 billion to complete, and would be the largest project of its kind in U.S. history. The earliest dam removal would begin is 2015.\nWaterWatch, Oregon Wild, the Hoopa Valley Tribe, and some farmers oppose the proposed agreement for a variety of reasons. \nIf implemented the removal would allow for 300 more miles of river habitat for spawning salmon. It would also include a new tribal reservation covering 90,000 acres for the Klamath Tribe. Funding has yet to be allocated for the entire project that includes habitat restoration in addition to the removal of the dams. \nAdditionally, it has yet to be determined who would pay for the actual demolition of the dams owned by PacifiCorp. Discussions that led to this proposal began in 2004 after PacifiCorp applied to renew its power generating licenses for its dams on the river."}

Chief of Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief, John Holmes, says the funds are urgently needed to provide humanitarian and early-recovery assistance over the next six months to approximately 500,000 people who have been affected by the violence that erupted in late December. The United Nations estimates that about half those affected have been internally displaced.\nAbout two dozen donor countries from Europe and elsewhere have been asked to help. The money will go to support 63 U.N. and non-governmental organizations who intend to deliver food aid, protection, shelter, water and sanitation and disease outbreak prevention. The largest amount of the appeal - ten million dollars - is intended to be allocated to food aid. \nThe European Union has said it may temporarily stop giving aid to Kenya unless the issues surrounding the election are resolved.\nHolmes says the U.N. hopes the situation in Kenya normalizes soon.\n\"What we want is a return to normality, a political solution as soon as possible, and also as I said last week, every effort to be made by all the leaders concerned - political, religious, whoever they may be - to prevent violence, to extend protection to civilians of all kinds, and to stop any kind of downward spiral of ethnic or other violence which may be very difficult to reverse once its stopped,\" said John Holmes.\nMany parts of Kenya have seen violence following the announcement of the December 27 presidential election results. More than 600 people are believed to have been killed in post-election violence, a quarter of a million have been driven from their homes and another 6,000 have fled to neighboring Uganda. "}

Higa is alleged to have thrown the child from a pedestrian overpass into oncoming traffic on Honolulu's H-1 Freeway. \nThe local coroner's office noted that the child died on impact after falling 30 feet (9 meters) from the overpass. This occurred during Thursday's lunch rush hour in the heart of downtown. Upon impact, several cars struck the child, which caused traffic to grind to a halt. \nThe toddler, Cyrus Nainoa Tupa\u02bbi Belt, was pronounced dead at the scene at 12:07 p.m. (2207 UTC), approximately 27 minutes after being allegedly being ejected from the overpass by Higa. The portion of H-1 was closed for approximately five hours with traffic diverted to side streets. The freeway was reopened in time for the evening commute.\nAt first the relationship between Higa and the child was unclear, but later reports stated that Higa lived adjacent to him and had babysat him on previous occasions. The boy's mother was out of town at the time of his death, but it was revealed that the child was supposed to be in the custody of his father and not with Higa.\nHiga graduated from Roosevelt High School in 2003. In the summer of 2004 Higa was involved in an incident where police reports indicate a three-car race resulted in the death of a friend. Higa has since had a criminal history, with more than a dozen arrests but no convictions, and reports from neighbors of erratic behavior. \nQueen's Medical Center, which houses a psychiatric ward in Honolulu, noted that he was a patient there as recently as December 11, 2007. When arrested, Higa was wearing hospital scrubs, which were not immediately conducive to whether Higa was a patient in Queen's psychiatric wing in the last couple of days. A representative of Queen's declined to comment on whether Higa was admitted in the last week."}

Bush, the president of the United States has suggested an economic growth package that could be worth almost 1% of the United States' GDP (the US GDP is appoximately US$15 trillion). The package is expected to come in the form of tax cuts. \nIn a speech which took place yesterday Mr.Bush said that the economy is an area of \"real concern,\" to the US government. He added that the US \"economy is still creating jobs, though at a reduced pace.\"\nDemocrats want the tax refunds to cover payroll taxes paid by lower-income groups and be combined with more unemployment benefits, food stamps and federal aid to states. It warned against bundling proposals to make Bush's first term tax cuts permanent with the stimulus package, and the Bush administration has separated the two in this proposal. \nWhen announcing the proposal George Bush said that \"as Congress considers such a plan, there are certain principles that must guide its deliberations: This growth package must be big enough to make a difference in an economy as large and dynamic as ours -- which means it should be about 1 percent of GDP.\" He added that \"this growth package must be built on broad-based tax relief that will directly affect economic growth -- and not the kind of spending projects that would have little immediate impact on our economy. This growth package must be temporary and take effect right away -- so we can get help to our economy when it needs it most.\" He also added that he believed the package \"must not include any tax increases.\"\nIn the speech George Bush also made it clear that he believes the package should be passed through congress quickly. He said that his belief was that by passing the package through congress quickly would \"provide a shot in the arm to keep a fundamentally strong economy healthy. And it will help keep economic sectors that are going through adjustments, such as the housing market, from adversely affecting other parts of our economy.\""}

On Friday, internet users in Turkey found the website replaced by a notice saying:\nA Turkish court issued a similar order in March last year, after a row between Turkish and Greek users escalated and resulted in insults of Atat\u00fcrk, a serious offense in Turkey. Internet service providers such as T\u00fcrk Telekom (the largest and formerly state-owned ISP) can use the domain name system to put the ban into effect.\nAt the moment, it remains unclear which videos or comments exactly are to blame. Some media sources say that the video compared Atat\u00fcrk with a monkey. This led some YouTube users to suspect that a video entitled 'ataturk was a gay and a monkey turkey turkiye turks' led to the block. This video was added on November 7, 2007, and is a series of images with Atat\u00fcrk's face on monkeys, homosexuals, obese individuals and several pictures of Borat. The uploader of the video, known as gaymal45, has several other videos which mock Prime Minister Erdogan and President Abdullah G\u00fcl.\nUnder article 301 of the Turkish penal code, public denigration of Turkishness, the Republic of Turkey, Atat\u00fcrk, and other national symbols, is punishable by imprisonment. The article received a lot of attention because it resulted in the prosecution of intellectuals like Literature Nobel Prize Winner Orhan Pamuk and murdered journalist Hrant Dink.\nIt is also unclear how long the ban would last. The ban in March was lifted after 3 days, when YouTube sent evidence to the Turkish prosecutor that the video had been removed."}

Paul has 14% with McCain currently trailing at 13%. Democrats also cast votes Saturday, with results expected later in the afternoon.\nThe Nevada caucuses were largely overshadowed by the Republican South Carolina primary, which is being held on the same day.

South Carolina was stripped of half its delegates after violating party rules by holding a primary contest before Super Tuesday.\nNew York state Senator Hillary Clinton has won the Nevada Democratic Caucus with 52% of the votes needed to win beating her opponent Barack Obama by 8% who had 44% of the votes. Hillary's win was boosted by minority Latino and women voters. There was some controversy over the fact that some at-large Democratic caucuses would be held in casinos, giving casino workers a chance to vote, the Nevada State Education Association and six individuals filed a lawsuit claiming this was unfair and would give more delegates then other locations and that this violates state law.

The \"History\" section of the site explains, in a satirical fashion, that the incident was prompted by the Church of Scientology's attempts to remove a promotional video featuring Scientologist Tom Cruise from YouTube. Though YouTube is complying with the Church of Scientology's requests to take down the video, other sites such as Gawker.com have stated that they will keep hosting the video. \nWriting in a blog post, Matthew Ingram of \"The Globe and Mail\" dubbed the ongoing conflict involving the Church of Scientology's attempts to remove the Cruise video from the Internet: \"Scientology vs. the Internet, part XVII\". He characterized the conflict between the Church of Scientology and anonymous posters of the Cruise video as \"another small skirmish in a war that Scientology has been waging for almost 15 years, since the early days of newsgroups such as alt.religion.scientology, which posted internal church documents in 1994. Lawsuits have been filed, mailing lists have been shut down, homes of discussion group participants have been raided and their computers seized -- an all-out war.\"\nOne poster admitted to being a part of the effort, writing in a blog post \"I have myself, as per instructions, loaded up Gigaloader and started bombarding the Scientology homepage.

Critics of Scientology at the Internet newsgroup alt.religion.scientology were critical of the attacks to the Church of Scientology website, with one poster writing \"How can people look at both sides if one side is gone?\"\nTraffic to the Scientology website had already increased 18-fold prior to the attack, following increased attention after the Tom Cruise video appeared on the Internet.

Church of Scientology related websites, such as religiousfreedomwatch.org have been removed due to a suspected distributed denial-of-service-attack (DDoS) by a group calling themselves \"Anonymous\". On Friday, the same group allegedly brought down Scientology's main website, scientology.org, which was available sporadically throughout the weekend. \nSeveral websites relating to the Church of Scientology have been slowed down, brought to a complete halt or seemingly removed from the Internet completely in an attack which seems to be continuous. The scientology.org site was back online briefly on Monday, and is currently loading slowly. \nOn Monday, the group released a video titled: \"Message to Scientology\" on YouTube concerning their intentions to attack the Church of Scientology. A robotic voice on the video begins with \"Hello leaders of Scientology. We are Anonymous,\" and continues by explaining their motivations: \"Over the years we have been watching you, your campaigns of misinformation, your suppression of dissent and your litigious nature. All of these things have caught our eye. With the leakage of your latest propaganda video into mainstream circulation the extent of your malign influence over those who have come to trust you as leaders has been made clear to us. Anonymous has therefore decided that your organisation should be destroyed.\" The message goes on to state that the group intends to \"expel Scientology from the Internet\". As of Wednesday, the video had been viewed 370,347 times, favorited 2,473 times, and is currently YouTube's top third video of the day.\nThe \"Message to Scientology\" video was highlighted as the \"YouTube Video of the Week\" by \"The Michigan Daily\". Commenting on the video, the piece states \"if this video is any indication, it seems like the assailants mean business\". In a blog post on \"USA Today\"'s website, Jess Zielinski wrote that it was \"not a shock that hackers hold a grudge against Scientology,\" and in a followup post on another \"USA Today\" blog, Angela Gunn wrote that \"those of us who remember ... the adventures of Operation Clambake are fascinated to see this kind of thing flare up again\". Blogging for \"Wired\" magazine, Ryan Singel wrote about the incident in a piece on Wednesay titled \"War Breaks Out Between Hackers and Scientology -- There Can Be Only One\". Singel wrote that the Project Chanology wiki page \"directs Anonymous members to download and use denial of service software, make prank calls, host Scientology documents the Church considers proprietary, and fax endless loops of black pages to the Church's fax machines to waste ink\". According to \"Wired\", \"The Church of Scientology did not immediately respond to a call for comment\".\nThe viewpoints expressed in the video are echoed on the \"Project Chanology\" website, an open source of information and direction for those within Anonymous, which talks of tactics such as blackfaxing and prank calling alongside other \"real-life\" methods of attack. The satirical website Encyclopedia Dramatica also has a similar page devoted to \"Project Chanology\".\n\"Anonymous\" released a statement on Monday in the form of a press release, \"Internet Group Anonymous Declares \"War on Scientology\": \"Anonymous\" are fighting the Church of Scientology and the Religious Technology Center\". In the statement, the group explained their goal as safeguarding the right to freedom of speech \"A spokesperson said that the group's goals include bringing an end to the financial exploitation of Church members and protecting the right to free speech, a right which they claim was consistently violated by the Church of Scientology in pursuit of its opponents.\" The press release also claimed that the Church of Scientology misused copyright and trademark law in order to remove criticism from websites including Digg and YouTube. The statement goes on to assert that the attacks from the group \"will continue until the Church of Scientology reacts, at which point they will change strategy\".\nThe attack was reportedly motivated by the Church of Scientology's attempts to remove a promotional video featuring Scientologist Tom Cruise from YouTube. After the Church of Scientology lodged a copyright infringement complaint with YouTube, the site took down the video. The Tom Cruise video is still available on Gawker.com, which has stated it will not remove the video \"It's newsworthy, and we will not be removing it.\" \nGawker.com discussed the actions of the \"Anonymous\" group, in a post on Monday titled \"Scientology vs. the Internet: Why Kids On The Internet Are Scientology's Most Powerful Enemy\". Gawker.com briefly outlined actions of other anonymous users critical of Scientology, including actions taken in the past by users of YouTube, Digg, and YTMND \"This isn't the only group of Internet users unafraid of the intimidating cult; a whole range of sites has turned the Church into a mockery by doing what mainstream celebrity-coverage outlets wouldn't dare.\"\nA poster on the newsgroup alt.religion.scientology (a.r.s.) was critical of the actions by the \"Anonymous\" group. In a post titled \"Open Letter to Anonymous\" Jeff Jacobsen, webmaster of lisamcpherson.org, posting as \"cultxpt\" wrote that \"It's understandable that people get upset over the things the Church of Scientology has done online and off\", pointing out that the Church of Scientology had \"tried to shut down a.r.s.\", and \"spam our newsgroup to this day\". In 1999 \"sporgery\", a form of nonsensical spam tactic, was used as an attempt to disrupt discussion on the newsgroup. Previously in 1995 Helena Kobrin, an attorney for the Church of Scientology, attempted to remove the a.r.s. group from Usenet. Kobrin sent a rmgroup message which stated: \"We have requested that the alt.religion.scientology newsgroup be removed from all sites\". This later led to a declaration of war by the hacker group Cult of the Dead Cow, and an increase in popularity of the a.r.s site. This initial conflict came to be known as \"Scientology versus the Internet\".\nThe post from Jacobsen went on to criticize the actions of the \"Anonymous\" group, stating: \"We're supposed to be the good people,\" and stated that contrary to the Anonymous group's tactics, \"Our weapons as critics are reason, evidence, argument, and free speech\".\nOn Tuesday, the founder of Operation Clambake, a non-profit organization and website critical of Scientology based in Stavanger, Norway, released a statement about the attacks by \"Anonymous\". Andreas Heldal-Lund was critical of the \"Anonymous\" groups actions, stating: \"The author of Operation Clambake does not condone such activity. Attacking Scientology like that will just make them play the religious persecution card. They will use it to defend their own counter actions when they try to shatter criticism and crush critics without mercy.\" Heldal-Lund went on to emphasize the right of all people and organizations to freedom of speech - including the Church of Scientology: \"Freedom of speech means we need to allow all to speak - including those we strongly disagree with. I am of the opinion that the Church of Scientology is a criminal organisation and a cult which is designed by its delusional founder to abuse people. I am still committed to fight for their right to speak their opinion.\""}

In the lower house, Prodi supporters still command a clear majority, in the form of Prodi's L'Unione, which took power after the 2006 elections.\nHowever, Thursday's vote in the Senate is expected to be very close. L'Unione has become destabilized due to the defection of UDEUR Populars, a somewhat small centrist party, but it can tip the balance of power. As a result, Prodi has come under pressure to resign before the vote.

The United States, meanwhile, has offered to train Pakistani security forces in their fight against the al-Qaeda-linked militants. \nThe fighting took place in South Waziristan province late Wednesday and Thursday. The army says security forces backed by helicopters attacked suspected hideouts of militants led by the country's most wanted man, Baitullah Mehsud.\nIn recent months, bomb attacks blamed on Mehsud's followers have claimed the lives of more than four hundred people throughout the country. Most of the violence has been aimed at the security forces, but both the United States and the Pakistani government blame Mehsud for the assassination last month of the opposition leader and former prime minister, Benazir Bhutto.\nThe army has retaliated with raids like the one this week, and can claim some battlefield success. The military said Thursday it had cleared three districts of militants, losing eight soldiers in the fighting.\nBut not everyone believes this is an effective way to deal with the insurgents.\nThe tribal region is a traditionally lawless and conservative region, whose inhabitants have been said to have never trusted the central Pakistani government. The region is also now home to scores of Taliban and al-Qaeda fighters who fled Afghanistan after the U.S.-led invasion of that country in 2001.\nRetired Lieutenant General Asad Durrani, the former chief of Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence group, is now a noted political analyst. He says the army's increased activity in the tribal areas only exacerbates the problem.\n\"It increases the level of insurgency in that area and that is what has been happening for the last, about four years,\" said Durrani. \"It is never a good thing, especially when you are using it [force] against your own people\u2026This was the wrong approach.\"\nInstead, Durrani says, the government should try to resolve the conflict through existing tribal structures, and mediation by influential figures trusted by both sides.\nAs fighting intensified in the region this week, Admiral William Fallon, the head of the U.S. military's Central Command, proposed that U.S. troops help train the Pakistani security forces in their fight against the militants.\nDurrani said that if the government agrees, it will anger many Pakistanis.\n\"It will make it worse\u2026There is hardly anything anyone can teach us\u2026The environments are different,\" he said. \"The approach may be generally the same, but the environments are different. So only we, and with the involvement of the people there, can resolve it. There is no special training required.\"\nThe government has not yet replied to Admiral Fallon's offer."}

Some want a reform of election rules before a new election is called. Recent opinion polls indicate that Silvio Berlusconi would become Prime Minister once more if elections were held.\nIt was the current election rules, introduced by Berlusconi during his most recent stint as Prime Minister, that allowed Prodi to assume power after the 2006 parliamentary elections.\n\"Now we must go to vote. We will say what we want to do in the first 100 days of our government,\" said former prime minister and opposition leader Berlusconi, demanding elections.\nIn a speech prior to the vote, Prodi said, \"Stopping the government's work is a luxury Italy cannot afford,\" and warned that Italy \"cannot afford a power vacuum.\""}

Bush and Congressional leaders from both political parties have reached agreement on US$150 billion in tax relief in an effort to help stimulate the United States economy. VOA White House Correspondent Scott Stearns has the story.\nThe agreement includes provision to give up to US$600 in tax rebates to millions of wage earners and an additional US$300 refund for each child. It allows businesses to immediately write off 50 percent of capital equipment purchases.\nPresident Bush says it is an effective, robust and temporary set of incentives that will boost the economy and create new jobs.\n\"This package has the right set of policies and is the right size,\" he said. \"The incentives in this package will lead to higher consumer spending and increased business investment this year.\"\nThe president says he knows Americans are concerned about their economic future, with the challenges of higher energy prices and a falling housing market slowing growth.\nPresident Bush is urging the House of Representatives and Senate to pass the agreement as soon as possible.\n\"We have an opportunity to come together and take the swift, decisive action our economy urgently needs,\" he added.\nStock markets around the world dipped sharply early this week amid widespread fears of a U.S. recession and its potential to drag down foreign markets as well.\nThe stimulus deal was an unusual display of bipartisanship in Washington, with Democrats and Republicans in the House making concessions to get the deal done quickly.\nRepublicans dropped a provision that would have allowed businesses to reclaim taxes previously paid. Democrats dropped their demands for increases in food stamps and unemployment benefits.\nHouse Speaker Democrat Nancy Pelosi says she is not totally pleased with the package, but knows it will help stimulate the economy.\n\"This bipartisan package should be acted upon rapidly and can help alleviate the economic pain felt by millions of Americans,\" she said.\nJohn Boehner is the leader of Republicans in the House of Representatives. He says it was not easy for Republicans and Democrats to agree on a plan, but he is confident it is in the best interests of the nation.\n\"This agreement is a big win for the American people,\" he said. \"It will stimulate our economy in the most direct and effective way possible by putting money in the hands of middle income American families and by giving businesses incentives to create and build new jobs in our country.\"\nTreasury Secretary Henry Paulson was the president's lead negotiator with Congress.\n\"I know the work isn't done yet,\" he noted. \"As the Speaker said, we've got more to do. And I am looking forward to working with the Senate and working with the House to get a package as soon as possible, because, again, speed is of the essence.\"\nSenate Majority Leader Democrat Harry Reid says he wants to get the plan to the president for signature by February 15.

Yesterday, the book hit the number one spot on \"The New York Times\" Best Sellers list. The book is not for sale in Britain or Ireland, and the \"New York Post\" has reported that British tourists to the United States are buying copies of the book to bring back home.\nMorton makes some controversial assertions in the book, including that Cruise is second in command at the Church of Scientology, and that Scientology was the cause of Cruise and Nicole Kidman's separation.\nCruise's attorney, Bertram Fields released a statement which said that the book was \"absolutely loaded with false statements.\" Cruise has threatened a USD$100 million lawsuit against Morton and the book's publisher, St. Martin's Press. The Church of Scientology also responded to Morton's claims in the book. In a 15-page statement, the Church called the book \"bigoted\" and a \"defamatory assault,\" and said that Cruise \"holds no official or unofficial position in the Church hierarchy.\"\nMorton was interviewed by the \"Associated Press\", and responded to some of the statements made by the Church of Scientology. When asked if he had attempted to interview Cruise for the book, Morton said \"I asked Tom for an interview and he declined.\" In response to a statement released by Cruise's publicists that he had not interviewed \"one person who has known or worked with Tom\" in the past twenty-five years, Morton responded \"I interviewed everyone from scriptwriters to producers to actors to actresses to teachers to girlfriends to pupils to Scientologists to people who have audited him.\" When questioned about his assertion that Cruise is \"second in command\" of the Church of Scientology, Morton stated \"Scientology would be a shadow of what it is today if it had not been for the involvement of Tom Cruise.\"\nJanet Maslin of \"The New York Times\" wrote that parts of the book \"push the limits of responsible reporting.\" A review in the \"Chicago Tribune\" was also critical, and Teresa Budasi wrote \"If you read Andrew Morton\u2019s unauthorized biography of Tom Cruise with a fan\u2019s curiosity in one hand and a thinking person\u2019s skepticism in the other, you\u2019ll likely end up in the same place you were before you read it: not all that interested.\" In his review of the book, Dave Shiflett of \"The Wall Street Journal\" commented on the litigious nature of the Church of Scientology, writing \"Mr. Morton, apparently unfazed by the reputation of the group's notoriously hair-triggered legal department, leaves few stones unhurled.\"\nShortly before the book's publication, a video produced by the Church of Scientology featuring Tom Cruise promoting his beliefs appeared on the Internet. After the Church of Scientology sent a legal complaint to the online video-sharing website YouTube, the video was taken down from that site, but is available on Gawker.com. A group of Internet users calling themselves \"Anonymous\" subsequently announced a \"War on Scientology\" including denial-of-service attacks against the Church of Scientology's main websites. Andreas Heldal-Lund, founder of the Scientology-critical site and Norway-based non-profit organization Operation Clambake released a statement on Tuesday critical of the actions of the \"Anonymous\" group, saying that the Church of Scientology deserves the right to freedom of speech.\nActor Jerry O'Connell, who had previously acted alongside Cruise in the 1996 film \"Jerry Maguire\", produced a parody of the Cruise video which was released on Wednesday. Other Hollywood acquaintances of Cruise, including comedians Adam Sandler and Ben Stiller, released statements defending Cruise and criticizing those who have mocked him for his beliefs. Sandler stated \"To see anyone\u2019s private life invaded and mocked like this is sickening,\" and Stiller commented \"People lose sight of the fact that Tom Cruise is actually a person. I feel for him.\"\nOn Wednesday the \"Associated Press\" reported that Cruise will be a presenter at the Screen Actors Guild Awards ceremony on Sunday."}

All that remains of 711chan.org is an apparent message to the members of the site to \"run\" and \"hide.\"\n\"711chan is full of fucking fail for siding with Gaia. I'm out of here, faggots.

It also refers to Anonymous' attempt to bring down the Church of Scientology (named 'Operation Chanology'), saying that \"chanology is lame, scientology is lame\". It thereafter declared that the message board where Anonymous had been discussing Operation Chanology had been removed. Minutes later, 711chan stopped responding to queries.\nThe legitimate administrators of 711chan regained control after only three minutes, but it took nearly six hours to restore the site with recent additions missing. However, The Regime took the site down again twelve hours later, claiming to have removed the backups and stating, \"all your db are belong to us\" (an allusion to the phrase \"all your base are belong to us\").\nA new video posted to YouTube by someone who claimed to be \"The Regime\" shows a logo and uses a computer animated voice to threaten 711chan.org and their affiliates. \"The Regime\", however, denies making the video saying \"we are in no way responsible for making, nor are we tied to that video in any way.\"\nThe video declares, \"Dear 'Anonymous'. We are The Regime. Your attacks on Scientology have not gone unnoticed.\" The video's text description states that \"Your attacks on Scientology have not gone unnoticed, we have the money, resources and tools to put an end to your SP behaviour and so called hacking activities. You have soiled the good name of LRH and now it is you that have *our* attention.\" \nThe acronyms in the text description are Scientology jargon \"suppressive person\" (a person who criticizes Scientology) and Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard. Both terms were also used recently in a leaked internal Church of Scientology video featuring Tom Cruise promoting his beliefs. The video goes on to state that \"Anonymous\" has been declared \"Fair Game\" (another Scientology term).\nThe title of \"The Regime\" video, \"Re: Message to Scientology\", is a reference to the video \"Message to Scientology\", which was posted by \"Anonymous\" to YouTube on Monday.

They also stated to \"define affiliated\" when \"Wikinews\" asked if they were part of the Church of Scientology.\nTheir motivations are still not clear. When asked what motivates their group to do what they do, they replied, \"What motivates any human to do anything? Money, Power, Respect?

It is currently the intention for this to remain the case.\nSmith said of the effect on relations with the US - which have been strong since World War II - \"It's not something which I believe will disturb what to date has been a very good working relationship between the new government and the (U.S.) administration. It's a very strong alliance - an alliance which transcends changes in governments. Administrations come and go, governments come and go, but the alliance is a long-term, enduring fundamental relationship between our two nations.\"\nThe confirmation is important as Australia saw a new government elected in November. Prime Minister Kevin Rudd (Labour) defeated Conservative head and former PM John Howard. Howard is a supporter of US President George W. Bush and his government."}

No-one was killed as the scheduled flight from Beijing, China lost power during final approach on January 17.\n136 passengers and 16 crew were on board when power was lost to the two Rolls-Royce engines about two miles from the runway, at a height of 600 feet. Autopilot and autothrottle were engaged at the time, the latter having just commanded an increase of thrust to the engines when power was lost. Co-pilot John Coward, in control at the time, was subsequently praised for being able to glide the disabled plane to within 1,000 feet of the runway, clearing a number of houses along the way.\nSubsequent investigation has revealed that not only did the engines not fail simultaneously, but neither failed completely, contradicting initial belief. A preliminary report by the United Kingdom's Aircraft Accident Investigation Branch (AAIB) stated that after the autothrottle commanded more thrust \"The engines both initially responded but after about 3 seconds the thrust of the right engine reduced. Some eight seconds later the thrust reduced on the left engine to a similar level... Both engines continued to produce thrust at an engine speed above flight idle, but less than the commanded thrust.\" This situation prevailed until impact.\nOn Wednesday the AAIB stated that they were examining \"All possible scenarios that could explain the thrust reduction and continued lack of response of the engines.\" However, it also went on to specifically mention attention to the jet's fuel system, saying \"This work includes a detailed analysis and examination of the complete fuel-flow path from the aircraft tanks to the engine-fuel nozzles.\" The AAIB also ruled out the plane having completely run out of fuel, stating that there was \"adequate fuel\" in the tanks when the plane crashed. In addition to the fuel required to get to the target destination or emergency alternative airport - whichever is further - aircraft typically carry between thirty and forty-five minutes worth of extra fuel as a safety margin.\nPossible scenarios being examined include fuel contamination, coming either from fuel taken on at Beijing or leakage from an unknown source. In particular, a heavy contaminant at the bottom of the tanks would explain a lack of earlier problems on the flight, as the fuel levels would only have become low in the final stages of the trip. Another possibility is that a central part of the fuel system developed a leak, reducing the amount of fuel available to the engines.\nIt is known that, according to the AAIB, \"the autothrottle and engine-control commands were performing as expected prior to, and after, the reduction in thrust,\" suggesting that all software in the aircraft was functioning correctly and rendering a software failure unlikely, although this possibility also remains under investigation."}

Some sources have said that there have been over 80 deaths in the last 3 days. The latest deaths come as former U.N. secretary-general Kofi Annan is in Kenya to try to broker a compromise.\nPolice had imposed an overnight curfew in the city of , about two hours north of Nairobi, after new violence broke out on Friday. The killings appear to be ethnically motivated, as Kikuyus seek revenge for attacks against their fellow tribesmen in recent weeks.\nOfficials estimate that nearly 800 people have been killed since the vote, which saw President Mwai Kibaki, a Kikuyu, defeat opposition candidate Raila Odinga by just 230,000 votes. Odinga supporters from the Luo, Kalenjin and other smaller ethnic groups claim the election was stolen, and international observers say the vote was flawed.\nWidespread anger at the election results sparked violence in Nairobi's slums and parts of the west, and tens of thousands of Kikuyus fled their homes. The violence had largely died down in recent days, but has erupted again in Nakuru.\nPolice also said Saturday that at least 15 people have been killed in the town of Molo, west of Nakuru. The two towns are in the Rift Valley, an ethnically mixed area that has seen violence in the past over land and resources.\n\"The Kalenjins had already pushed and got the Kikuyus earlier so what they are doing is the Kikuyus are trying to revenge and get back their places, get back their houses,\" said Jimmy Mucheru, who is a local safari guide in Nakuru. \"There is not much hope for peace because the two groups are really after each other.\"\nThe new wave of violence came as former U.N. secretary-general Kofi Annan was in Kenya trying to resolve the crisis. In a news conference on Saturday, he urged followers of the two leaders to remain calm. He said he saw several camps for people who have been displaced by the crisis.\n\"What we saw was rather tragic,\" he noted. \"We visited several IDP camps, we saw people pushed from their homes, from their farms, grandmothers, children, families uprooted. And I think it is important that all Kenyans respond with sympathy and understanding and not try to [seek] revenge.\"\nOn Thursday, Mr. Annan managed to secure the first face-to-face meeting between Mr. Kibaki and Mr. Odinga, a move hailed as a breakthrough. But the two sides have shown no willingness to negotiate issues of substance. Mr. Kibaki insists he is the legitimate president of Kenya, while Mr. Odinga is demanding a new vote.\nMr. Annan urged people to give more time to Mr. Kibaki and Mr. Odinga to work out a solution.\n\"No one should take the law into his or her own hands,\" he added. \"Allow the leaders the opportunity to resolve these issues - and as I said - including the long-term issues. And we are here to help them, that was the purpose and objective of that meeting.\"\nMr. Annan told reporters it is unacceptable that no one has been held accountable for the violence, though he did not apportion blame.\nEarlier this week, the New York-based Human Rights Watch reported what it said was evidence that the opposition had organized some attacks. Mr. Odinga's team has denied those claims."}

On the one hand, since most of the earth's surface is water or unpopulated, death or property loss due to any falling fragments, which may result from the satellite entering the atmosphere, is statistically unlikely. On the other hand, it cannot be ruled out entirely. According to General Gene Renuart, of the United States Air Force, there is a chance that the satellite may re-enter over North America. After entering the atmosphere, some debris could possibly fall on land.\n\"Numerous satellites over the years have come out of orbit and fallen harmlessly. We are looking at potential options to mitigate any possible damage this satellite may cause,\" said Johndroe.\nConcerns have also been raised that some materials used in the satellite's construction could be hazardous if they reach the ground. The satellite contains quantities of toxic hydrazine fuel, which is used for maneuvering, although this is likely to burn up on re-entry. Some of the optics aboard the satellite may contain beryllium, which is also toxic.\nAs the satellite was part of a classified U.S. military program, no other details, including its name, have been made public. The satellite is publicly identified by the codenames \"USA-193\" and \"NRO L-21\". It was launched in December 2006, by a Delta II rocket from Vandenberg Air Force Base. Ground controllers lost contact with the satellite shortly after it reached orbit. Amateur observers had been tracking USA-193 for some time, and believed that its orbit was decaying. "}

An insurgency against The Church of Scientology.\"\nNot long after their attack, a previously unknown group called \"The Regime\" used keylogging to gain an administrator password to 711chan.org.\n\"I was actually away from home when I noticed my personal dedi was compromised (my bash_history file had lots of strange entries), so I informed Partyvan IRC staff (the CoS raid room as well as 711chan's IRC room are there) and minutes later, 711chan's machine was also compromised. I arrived home around an hour later, and immediately restored the contents of the 711 machine back to a previous state. I also got the passwords reset on my dedi and that was back in order. I went to bed shortly after that,\" said Plasma in regards to \"The Regime's\" attack on \"711chan\".\n\"The next morning I wake up to hundreds of MSN windows and emails telling me both servers have been compromised again, and our backups for 711 have been removed. The software we use to run 711chan's machine got bugged up somehow and make it difficult for me to fix things, which is why the site didn't respond at all for most of the day. At the time of writing this I still haven't got the backups reloaded onto the machine,\" added Plasma.\nPlasma states that \"711chan.org\" will be off line at least until the end of January, possibly longer, but the site is not expected to change.\n\"I shut down our server to prevent any more damage. Right now, our plan is to lay low and get stuff started up on a more secure machine. We'll be back up by the end of the month, hopefully. 711chan will probably be staying the same it is, however,\" said Plasma.\nBut they didn't go down without a fight adds Plasma.\n\"As who the \"Regime\" is? I took a look at one of the things they planted on my machine, which lead me to #!!regime on GameSurge IRC. `immortal' and about 30 drones were in that channel. Members of the g00ns community (allies of 711, also linked to Partyvan IRC) found out they had dox (documents such as phone numbers, addresses, SSN numbers, names, that sort of thing) on `immortal' and his wife. I actually have these details and attempted to call him, but it went unanswered,\" said Plasma.\nThe information that \"711chan.org\" obtained was later posted on the website operated by \"The Regime\". \"Wikinews\" has attempted to contact \"The Regime\" a second time regarding the incident, and they have only replied with \"your articles are bullshit.\""}

We are going along fighting al Qaida, fighting militant Taleban and fighting Talebanization flowing outside,\" he said. \"And also fighting extremism in some segments of our society in Pakistan.\"\n\"The question that needs to be asked is how come if General Musharraf is our best bet to fight terrorism, how come terrorism is increasing by leaps and bounds. Last year was the bloodiest year for Pakistan, culminating in the assassination of [opposition leader] Benazir Bhutto,\" said Khan. \nPresident Musharraf's government has come under increasing criticism at home and abroad, and world leaders have repeatedly urged him to move ahead with democratization.\nPresident Musharraf said he reassured Prime Minister Brown about the upcoming vote.\n\"I did inform the Prime Minister [of] our strong desire to go forward with the elections and to ensure that elections will be fair, free and transparent,\" said Mr. Musharraf.\nThe elections are scheduled for February 18 and opposition politician Imran Khan says they will be vital. He said it is also important that western powers support the process.\n\"In my opinion the only way forward for Britain and the United States is to back not people, not individuals, not political parties, but the democratic process. They should back free and fair elections in Pakistan. It is the only way out of this quagmire,\" he said.\nKhan was among hundreds of anti-Musharraf protesters outside Prime Minister Brown's offices at Number 10 Downing Street."}

The decision was made by the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority, which oversees the national curriculum.\nMcDonald's said it will offer a \"basic shift manager\" course, which will train staff in marketing, customer service, and other areas of restaurant management. Completion of this course will be the equivalent of passing the GCSE, the standard exam taken at age 16, or the Advanced Level, taken at age 18.\nNetwork Rail plans to offer a course in rail engineering, while Flybe is developing a course involving aircraft engineering and cabin crew training. Passing Flybe's course could result a university level degree.\nPrime Minister Gordon Brown supports the plan. \"It is going to be a tough course, but once you have got a qualification in management you can probably go anywhere,\" Brown said. He emphasized the importance of higher education, saying, \"Every young person needs a skill and to think about going to college, doing an apprenticeship or university.\"\nJohn Denham, Secretary of State for Innovation, Universities and Skills, called the decision \"an important step towards ending the old divisions between company training schemes and national qualifications\" and said it will \"benefit employees, employers and the country as a whole.\"\nHowever, some people are unsure of the plan's effectiveness.

The video \"Call to Action\" uses the same computer synthesized voice as a previous video titled \"Message to Scientology\", which was posted to YouTube last Monday. The \"Message to Scientology\" video has been viewed over 1,400,000 times, and the \"Call to Action\" video has already been viewed over 237,000 times.\nAnonymous is taking action against the Church of Scientology in response to what it sees as suppression of freedom of speech on the Internet. The group was first motivated after the Church of Scientology issued a copyright infringement claim to YouTube regarding a promotional video of Scientologist Tom Cruise speaking about his beliefs and using Scientology jargon. The Church of Scientology also issued a legal complaint to the website Gawker.com which is also hosting the video, but Gawker has stated it will not take the video down because it is newsworthy.\nAnonymous set up a movement called \"Project Chanology\" to coordinate their efforts, and took down several Church of Scientology websites through denial-of-service attacks. Members of Anonymous have also participated in prank calls to Church of Scientology centers, as well as protests or \"raids\" outside Scientology buildings, and have posted some of their exploits to YouTube. \nIn the \"Call to Action\" video, Anonymous denies that they are composed solely of \"super hackers\", stating \"Anonymous is a collective of individuals united by an awareness that someone must do the right thing, that someone must bring light to the darkness, that someone must open the eyes of a public that has slumbered for far too long.\" The video goes on to state \"We want you to be aware of the very real dangers of Scientology,\" citing what they term \"gross human rights violations\". \nSpecific controversial events in Scientology history are cited in the video, including Operation Freakout and Paulette Cooper, and Operation Snow White. Operation Freakout was the name of a Church of Scientology operation whose goal was to \"get P.C. [Paulette Cooper] incarcerated in a mental institution or jail or at least to hit her so hard that she drops her attacks.\" Paulette Cooper had written a book critical of Scientology called \"The Scandal of Scientology\". Operation Snow White was the name of a Church of Scientology operation where members of the Church's secretive Guardian's Office infiltrated United States government agencies in Washington, D.C. including the I.R.S. The F.B.I.'s investigation into Operation Snow White led them to discover the planning of actions taken against Paulette Cooper.\nThe video concludes by inviting the viewer to \"take up the banner of free speech\" and protest with Anonymous world wide. In an email to \"CNET News\", Anonymous stated that cities where unknown activities are planned on February 10 include New York City, Montreal, Houston, London, Melbourne, and Los Angeles.\nOn Friday, two spokespersons for the Church of Scientology commented on the recent actions of Anonymous. A spokesman told \"News.com.au\" \"These types of people have got some wrong information about us,\" and Church spokeswoman Yvette Shank told \"Sun Media\" that she regarded members of Anonymous as a \"pathetic\" group of \"computer geeks\". On Monday, \"Radar\" reported that the Church of Scientology has asked the U.S. Attorney General's office in Los Angeles, the F.B.I., and the LAPD to start a criminal investigation of possible criminal activity related to the Internet attacks. A source told \"Radar\" that the Church of Scientology is arguing that the Internet attacks are a form of \"illegal interference with business.\" \"Radar\" also reports that the Church of Scientology is emphasizing its status as a religious organization in the United States, in order to assert that the Internet attacks can be classed as hate crimes.\nOn Saturday, Mark Bunker of the website XenuTV.com posted a video to YouTube criticizing the illegal actions of Anonymous and suggested legal methods for them to retaliate against the Church of Scientology, including peaceful protesting, writing letters to their government representatives, and persuading the United States government to take away the Church of Scientology's tax exempt status. In the video, Bunker states \"I'm mainly concerned because you shouldn't be doing things that are illegal, you just shouldn't. It's not morally right, and it's not right when Scientology does it, it's not right when we do it.\" Bunker's video post has been viewed over 156,000 times. On Sunday, Bunker posted a follow-up video to YouTube where he gives advice to Anonymous on how to peacefully picket. He also provides viewers with resources and weblinks to more information on how to hold a peaceful protest. He concludes this video by imitating Obi-Wan Kenobi's Jedi mind trick technique and voice from \"Star Wars\", stating \"And if I may, as Obi-Wan, tell you: \"You will do nothing illegal\" \"."}

He claims he had his head was forced back and one of the Blue Men forced the tube in him. The joke is to show footage from the inside of the audience member.\nThe Blue Man Group says that nothing actually goes down anyone's throat.\n\" 'Esophagus Video' is simply an illusion,\" the group wrote in its press release. \"A camera is held in an actor's hands, the actor's hands are placed near an audience member's mouth (not on or in). The live-feed video screen then switches to a pre-recorded medical video, resulting in the hilarious and absurd illusion that the audience is peering down an individual's esophagus. Because the camera never enters the mouth, the execution of this illusion could not possibly put anyone at risk of injury.\"\nThe group added the skit and skits like it have been performed for the past 15 years by them without complaint.\nThe Californian is suing on the basis that the alleged tube was unsafely dirty and that his experience being cornered gave him post-traumatic stress and nightmares.\nSrodon also claims he lost fillings and dental work because of the tube. The suit is reported to be seeking damages of more than $500,000, however the group reported that they have not been served papers as of Friday morning.\nThe Blue Man Group has a lot of audience participation as part of their show and is a Las Vegas fixture.

Since State of the Union addresses are traditionally only given yearly in January, he will likely not give another one.\nRather than focus on the past, Bush talked at length about the issues that will shape his legacy - starting with the war in Iraq and his decision to send in an additional 30,000 U.S. troops.\n\"Some may deny the surge is working, but among the terrorists there is no doubt,\" he said. \"Al-Qaeda is on the run in Iraq, and this enemy will be defeated.\"\nAbout half the speech dealt with foreign policy, with a heavy focus on the Middle East. President Bush talked about his hopes for an Israeli-Palestinian peace deal, and issued a challenge to the government of Iran.\n\"Come clean about your nuclear intentions and past actions, stop your oppression at home, and cease your support for terror abroad,\" he said. \"But above all, know this: America will confront those who threaten our troops, we will stand by our allies, and we will defend our vital interests in the Persian Gulf.\"\nBush also spoke of his determination to protect the American economy. He acknowledged many Americans worry the slowdown in economic growth could evolve into a full-blown recession, and he sought to calm their fears.\n\"In the long run, Americans can be confident about our economic growth,\" he said. \"But in the short run, we can all see that growth is slowing.\"\nThe president called on Congress to pass the economic stimulus package the administration worked out with Democratic and Republican leaders in the House. And he urged lawmakers to re-authorize a program that enables the government to secretly monitor communications between Americans and terror suspects abroad without a prior court warrant.\nOn these and other matters, Bush said everyone should put politics aside.\n\"In this election year, let us show our fellow Americans that we recognize our responsibilities and are determined to meet them,\" he said. \"And let us show them that Republicans and Democrats can compete for votes and compete for results at the same time.\"\nTwo of the Democrats running for their party's presidential nomination \u2014 Senators Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama \u2014 were in the chamber for the president's speech.\nThe official Democratic response to the address was delivered by Kansas Governor Kathleen Sebelius.\n\"Tonight's address begins the final year of this presidency, with new leaders on the horizon and uncertainty throughout our land,\" she said. \"Conditions we face, at home and abroad, are results of choices made and challenges unmet.\""}

In the resulting standoff, approximately 30 employees and customers were taken hostage.\nToday, after the standoff has lasted more than 24 hours, with a helicopter hovering above, the bank is surrounded by hundreds of heavily armed police, television crews, and the victims relatives. The gunmen released a few hostages on Monday evening and two employees escaped, including a security guard who ran from the building as the gunmen fired shots at him.\nThe hostages, which are said to include a pregnant woman and small children, occasionally appear in the windows of the bank, ostensibly to show relatives that they are still alive. One hostage displayed a placard in of the windows. It read, \"We are in real danger. They can kill us. Please help.\"\nThe hostage takers are demanding an ambulance in which they wish to be allowed to drive away with their stolen goods and a handful of hostages. Negotiators said they had turned down an offer to let them surrender in front of live cameras with guarantees that police would not fire a shot.\nPolice cut off running water to the bank, but have made deliveries of food, drinking water, and diapers. Some hostages have sent text messages to relatives and one even managed to place a phone call to regional radio station.\nSpeaking on Uni\u00f3n Radio, local security official Manuel Granadillo said, \"They appear to be new at this.

Young people can talk with the team via email and mobile phone texting, and they also have the opportunity to talk with other similar like-minded people through the on site Internet forum. Ms Bagnall said that research undertaken proved that text and email were the most \"effective\" ways of communicating with youth. \"We also consulted and pre-tested with young people.\"\nTexting is the preferred method for communication.\nMs Bagnall said they were unsure how much the service - which started December 6, 2007 - would cost annually, but expected it to be near the half-million dollar mark due to the recent nature of the site and on going development.\nThey do not receive any free services from Internet providers and mobile phone companies. However this isn't a worry for them because, as Ms Bagnall says, it is a \"public service, not a commercial one so it is not trying to run at a profit.\"\nThe Lowdown is always able to be reached. A trained health professional is available between midday and midnight each day, including Christmas Day. Ms Bagnall said, \"They work shifts and have their holidays at other times.\"\nThere are six staff members at The Lowdown. However, Ms Bagnall says, \"The Ministry is aware of gaps [...] in the number of health professionals available to young people. The Lowdown is one of many attempts to improve access to services to young people in need.\"\nNot only do they have health professionals on staff, but they also have support from celebrities. Local New Zealand celebrities accompany the exploration of the site giving helpful advice; sharing their own personal experiences and stories on depression; and home grown music provided free of charge. \"The musicians were extremely generous with their time and music. They were very supportive of the purpose of the website and didn't get paid for their contributions, but their music is being promoted through the site.\"\nAn average of 320 visitors per day have visited the depression-focused help site between January 1 and January 23, 2008. Ms Bagnall said that most of those accessing the service are in the targeted market. \"The service has been running for only a few weeks so we don't have accurate figures yet and we don't know the ages of site visitors unless they access the help services.\"\nNew Zealand has high suicide statistics for both youth and older people. Each year there are 500 suicides, of which young people account for 100. Compared to other OECD countries, males between 15 and 24 years of age have the second highest suicide rate behind Finland. New Zealand is placed third behind Finland and Japan for females of the same age group. Age-standardised rates for males are fourth highest in the OECD, the fifth highest for females."}

Political pressure is also building on the government for its failure to anticipate and solve the problems. \nA top Chinese disaster relief official was quoted by Hong Kong's \"South China Morning Post\" newspaper Thursday as calling it the worst natural disaster since the People's Republic was founded in 1949.\nTens of millions of Chinese have been affected by the snowstorms across the central and southern parts of the country. Hundreds of thousands are camping out in train stations, hoping the snowed-in trains will start running again to take them home for the lunar new year holiday. An unknown number of people are stranded on icy highways, cut off from adequate heat and food.\nThe situation is so serious that Premier Wen Jiabao has personally visited train stations in Hunan and Guangdong provinces in the past couple of days. He is telling stranded workers the government is trying to get transportation moving so they can get home for the holiday. But other officials have advised migrant workers to forget about going home, and stay in their places of work.\nOfficials say unusually low temperatures and heavy snowfalls have destroyed crops and greenhouses, and are severely affecting winter food production. Chen Xiwen is the deputy director of the Communist Party's leading financial team. \nChen says the impact of the disaster in southern China on winter crop production is extremely serious. He says the impact on fresh vegetables and fruit has been catastrophic in some places.\nPrices for fresh fruit and vegetables have doubled in some of the worst-hit areas. The situation is exacerbating the rise in food prices that began last year. \nChina's consumer price index rose nearly 5 percent for all of 2007, and was up 6.5 percent in December alone. A major part of the increase was in food prices. \nChen, however, says he does not expect inflation this month to get worse, despite the crop damage being caused by the snow. \nChen says winter grain and edible oils are grown mainly in the north, which is outside the storms' reach, and winter wheat production will not be seriously affected. \nTwo weeks of ice and snowstorms have killed more than 60 people and caused more than three billion dollars in direct damage.\nChina's top weather expert told state media Thursday the storms will last well into the new year holiday, which begins February 6. \nThe lunar new year is China's most important holiday.

But we'll still keep several songs from Namco original, Japanese-pop, and classical music in this upcoming game.\n I believe that a developer should be aware of international copyright coordination before choosing a song for a game, not only in rhythm games, but also games of other types. For instance, I know that some controversy erupted in Taiwan after some covers of Japanese songs were recorded in other languages without agreements from the original singers and composers. Before the release of this upcoming game, have you coordinated with record companies about the copyright issues?\nYabushita: Everyone should respect copyrights, as you said. I guarantee that every song from the \"Taiko no Tatsujin\" series in console and arcade versions is licensed through coordination with those companies.\n Some gamers may be confused because the console version of the \"Taiko no Tatsujin\" series is only available for PS2. After the release of the \"Taiko no Tatsujin 11: Asian Version\", will the NBGI release different versions in different countries similar to the way \"Taiko Drum Master\" was released with special designs for American and European gamers?\nYabushita: Currently, we'll focus our developments on the arcade version and temporarily not to consider different releases for different countries. This is because we will evaluate opinions from amusement stores and gamers after its release.\nSummary.\nThe \"Taiko no Tatsujin\" series became a hot topic after amusement stores imported several arcade machines in Taiwan.

The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control found 19 cases of resistance among 148 samples from last November. Among 16 samples from Norway, 12 showed resistance.

The Ycu\u00e1 Bola\u00f1os supermarket fire in Asunci\u00f3n left 374 dead, 450 others injured and nine missing, presumed dead.\nStore owner Juan Pio Paiva, 64, received 12 years imprisonment whilst his son Daniel Paiva, 40, was given 10 years. A security guard, Daniel Areco, was given a five-year sentence while three business associates of the Paivas were cleared of any criminal activity.\n2,000 people were in the store when fire broke out on August 1, 2004, including many families with young children. Fire doors were shut to prevent looting, worsening the situation.\nThe investigation found that flames broke out in a badly built chimney because of inadequately maintained equipment. A lack of fire escapes, fire detection system and fire suppression system all contributed to the disaster. Most of the deaths were caused by asphyxiation due to the smoke. The nine missing bodies are believed to have been completely destroyed by the extreme temperature.\nPaiva senior was convicted on the basis that as the owner and chief administrator of the business, including the building, he was responsible for overall safety. His son was responsible for the food court area, the site where the blaze started. The security guard was convicted for blocking the exits, although he was acting on senior orders. The three other businessmen were acquitted as they were not involved in the administration of the store.\nThe Paivas were both convicted of manslaughter and exposing people to danger within the workplace. Areco was found guilty of negligence.\nThe three judge tribunal was headed by German Torres. It replaced an earlier trial in 2006, when the court announced that it was 2-1 in favour of more lenient sentences, but got no further as friends and relatives stormed the courtroom and rioted in the streets outside. The court had been going to hand out five-year sentences to the Paivas.\nA peaceful protest was also held at yesterday's verdict, with demonstrators shouting \"Assassins! Assassins!\" and \"This kind of justice is injustice!\" Ten women who lost relatives fainted in the heat and were hospitalised. The protestors were pressing for those involved to receive the maximum possible sentence of 25 years. One, Lys Torres, vowed to use the appeals courts to press for tougher sentences. \"Its an outrage. They're responsible for the death of 400 people and they've been given ridiculous sentences,\" said Lys, who is a spokeswoman for the relatives and survivors group. \"This shows that in this country, people with money can kill with impunity,\" Bersabe Meza, who lost her husband in the fire, said.\nChief prosecuter Edgar Sanchez, who had also requested maximum sentences, said \"My conscience is clear. I've done my job.\"Meanwhile, relatives laid out a white plastic chair in the streets for each of those killed, adorned with signs bearing such notices as \"If there is no justice, the people will rise up.\"\nThe ruined store remains standing, graffitied and adorned in tribute to those who died."}

But no new crossings are being permitted.\nHamas-affiliated militants on the Gaza side of the border have been turning people back and telling them it is closed. There were reports of scuffles with Gazans who still wanted to cross into Egypt, but most reports said the situation remained fairly calm.\nA senior Hamas leader in Gaza, Mahmoud Zahar, said Saturday there had been an agreement between Egypt and Hamas to control the border, and suggested that the closure might be temporary. Egyptian officials have not commented on the existence of any deal with Hamas, but have repeatedly vowed to regain full control of the situation at the border.\nLocal resident Ibrahim Mohammed Ahmed owns a small grocery shop in Rafah. He spoke to VOA by telephone from the nearby town of Sheikh Zuwayad. \nHe said the situation is tight and controlled now. The government has closed the entire border in Rafah and all the roads. Every 100 meters there is a checkpoint. \nA Palestinian who crossed into Egypt to visit relatives, Essam Ibrahim Issa, spoke to VOA by phone from another small community near Rafah.\nHe said all the roads are blocked and Egyptian security forces are making Palestinians return to Gaza. He said, They put them in trucks and take them back to Rafah.\nIssa said Hamas has indicated that the border will re-open in about a week, and he is hoping for a new agreement that will let him cross into Egypt legally.\nHe said he would be heading home to Gaza later in the day, but once the border crossing is officially reopened, he wants to return to Egypt legally, allowing him freedom of movement.\nThe border closure ends 11 days of unrestricted movement across the Egypt-Gaza border. Gunmen in Gaza blew open sections of the border barricade on January 23, days after Israel began imposing a near-total blockade on the territory. Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians crossed into Egypt to buy food and other supplies that had become scarce or expensive in Gaza. \nEgyptian security forces set up a cordon around the border town of Rafah, trying to keep Palestinians from moving further into Egypt. Egypt says at least 17 Palestinians have been arrested in Sinai carrying weapons and explosives since the crisis began.\nThe international community and the Fatah-led Palestinian Authority have objected to any border deal involving Hamas, which violently seized control of Gaza in June. \nEgypt, however, views the open border as a serious security risk and has pressed Fatah to accept some kind of deal with Hamas in order to see that it remains under control.

Christopher Speer, in addition to attempted murder, conspiracy, providing material support for terrorism, and spying. The charges stem from a 2002 incident in which the 15-year old allegedly threw a grenade at U.S. troops after they directed an air-strike at the Afghan compound he was sharing with Mujahideen insurgents.\nA number of groups, including Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, have sent a letter to Secretary of Defence Robert Gates alleging that the military tribunal is \"not equipped to meet juvenile justice standards\" and that Khadr should either be tried before a civilian court or repatriated to Canada.\nJennifer Daskal, senior counter-terrorism counsel at Human Rights Watch explained that the United States \"should not make matters worse by prosecuting him before an unfair military tribunal.\"\nKhadr's lawyer Dennis Edney challenged the attempts to label the 21-year old as a war criminal asking \"...Why is he not being treated as a child soldier?\" Lt Cdr Bill Kuebler, the American military commissions counsel in the case, agreed that the charges should be dismissed since the tribunal lacked the jurisdiction to prosecute minors.\nCanadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper however, has said that his country will not intervene in the case to seek extradition of Khadr, re-affirming Canada's status as the only Western country who has not demanded the release or extradition of their citizens held in Guantanamo.\nClaiming to have been abused, threatened with rape and forced into painful positions since his arrival in Guantanamo in 2002 , Omar Khadr has been the subject of two psychiatric assessments that claimed he suffered from mental disorder as a result of his imprisonment, and was at risk of suicide.\nKhadr was previously charged by the Guantanamo military commission in November 2005, before the judicial body was ruled \"unlawful\" by the Supreme Court. Last June, a military judge dismissed a second series of charges against Khadr because his 2004 Combatant Status Review Tribunal had classified as an \"enemy combatant\" rather than an \"illegal enemy combatant\", meaning that he did not qualify under the Military Commissions Act. Three months later, however, the Court of Military Commission Review ruled that the Commission would be allowed to make its own determination of the legality of a combatant."}

The group was initially motivated by the Church of Scientology's attempts to remove a promotional video featuring Scientologist Tom Cruise from the Internet. The Church of Scientology issued legal complaints to YouTube and to Gawker.com; YouTube took the video down, but Gawker has refused to do so.\nProject Chanology participants successfully took down several Scientology websites in mid-January utilizing denial-of-service attacks. The group has organized a series of nonviolent protests to take place outside Church of Scientology centers worldwide on February 10, 2008. There are expected to be at least 217 protests taking place on the 10th outside Church of Scientology buildings around the globe, including New York City, Montreal, Houston, London, Melbourne, and Los Angeles.\nProtestors at the Orlando, Florida rally held signs with messages including \"Knowledge is Free Scientology Isn't\", \"Who Is Lisa McPherson?\", \"www.xenu.net\", and \"Honk if you hate Scientology.\" An unnamed organizer of the rally told the \"Orlando Sentinel\" that the group is protesting \"a gross violation of the right to see free church material,\" referring to the Tom Cruise video the Church of Scientology attempted to suppress. According to \"WKMG-TV\", protestors claim the Church of Scientology is a \"dangerous cult\" and said the organization is responsible for crimes and deaths. \nDr. Lee Sheldon of the Church of Scientology of Orlando released a statement regarding the protests: \"While we recognize the right to legal protest, when such protest escalates to spreading lies and hate speech, it is a concern for everyone. We look forward to continuing to provide service to the city of Orlando and Central Florida.\" \nAccording to a post from a protestor to the online newsgroup alt.religion.scientology, Scientologists complained to the police during the protest that the event should be shut down for advocating \"hate speech\", but the \"Orlando Sentinel\" reported that police monitored the event and made no arrests.\nMark Bunker of XenuTV.com had previously criticized Project Chanology for the denial-of-service attacks against Scientology websites, but in a YouTube video post on Sunday, Bunker spoke positively of Saturday's nonviolent protest in Florida. \"I saw a video today from Orlando and there were a hundred and fifty people out on Saturday to protest and it looked like a lot of fun. Got a lot of car honks and everything looked peaceful and I want to say nice job and I hope everything goes as smoothly on February 10th. I have to say a hundred and fifty people in Orlando that's pretty impressive. Can't wait to see what happens at other cities around the country and around the world actually.\""}

Brown-Waite's &quot;foreign&quot; comment", "text": "\"The Orlando Sentinel\" published a scathing editorial rebuke of Ginny Brown-Waite in its Monday edition. The editorial specifically addressed comments made by the lawmaker last week that Puerto Ricans are \"foreign citizens\" and therefore should not receive tax rebate checks from the United States government.\nIn a press release sent out last Tuesday, Rep. Brown-Waite (R-FL) said, \"...The bill sends hundreds of millions of dollars to people who do not pay federal income taxes, including residents of Puerto Rico and territories like Guam. I do not believe American taxpayer funds should be sent to foreign citizens who do not pay taxes. Americans want an economic stimulus for Dunnellon, Brooksville and Clermont, not for San Juan or Hag\u00e5t\u00f1a. As the legislation moves forward, it must be changed to ensure that only federal taxpaying American citizens receive rebate checks.\"\nRep. Brown-Waite represents the fifth congressional district of Florida, which covers much of the Tampa Bay and Orlando metropolitan areas, which are home to sizable numbers of Puerto Ricans. Puerto Rico is a commonwealth, or an unincorporated organized territory, of the United States. While Puerto Rico natives do not pay federal income tax if they are non-Federal employees, they do pay toward Social Security, Medicare and other salaried taxes. Puerto Ricans have been citizens of the United States since the passing of the Jones-Shafroth Act in 1917. Also mentioned in Rep. Brown-Waite's statement are residents of Guam, who do pay taxes but the revenues stay on the island, located in the western Pacific. Guamanians have been American citizens since 1950.\nEduardo Bhatia, the Washington, D.C.-based representative for the Governor of Puerto Rico, wrote a letter to Rep. Brown-Waite condemning her remarks. \"Your comments...published in the Orlando Sentinel complaining that Puerto Ricans are 'foreign citizens' and should not benefit from the federal economic stimulus plan were not only wrong but also highly insensitive,\" Bhatia wrote, continuing on to hypothesize that her remarks \"stemmed from sheer ignorance about Puerto Rico.\" After making that remark, Bhatia went on to chastise Rep. Brown-Waite's press release further, citing that there are over two million Puerto Ricans living in New York and Florida, the state Rep. Brown-Waite is from and the state she represents in Congress, respectively.\nJos\u00e9 Aponte, the Speaker of the House of Representatives of Puerto Rico, also condemned Brown-Waite and her remarks, asking for a full apology to Puerto Rico and Puerto Ricans living in the United States. \"Congresswoman Brown-Waite's statement is infuriating and contradictory as it pertains to four million of her fellow American citizens that live in our island...the distorted perception she has of Puerto Ricans is incredible given that she is part of a state with a large population of Hispanics of which close to a million are Puerto Ricans.\"\nThe Puerto Rican community in Central Florida, which numbers 220,000 in the Orlando area alone, were livid after hearing of Brown-Waite's remarks. \"She is an ignoramus,\" said Emilio P\u00e9rez, president of the Puerto Rican Chamber of Commerce of Central Florida. \"I think we should make an example of her. Puerto Ricans should unite to support whoever is running against her in the next election.\" Zulma V\u00e9lez Estrada, a Puerto Rican activist in Kissimmee, called for protests in an open letter she wrote to the Puerto Rican community. \"Are we going to consent to this nonsense or are we going to stand for our dignity and demonstrate our place in history, and in this community?\"\nHowever, it was \"The Orlando Sentinel\" that had a sizable say in Monday's edition, dedicating their second editorial column in the past five days to Rep. Brown-Waite and her remarks. \"It's bad enough that an elected official serving in Washington should be so clueless, but Mrs. Brown-Waite then became defiant when she was called out on her historical hiccup,\" the editorial stated, which represents the majority opinion of the editorial board at Central Florida's largest newspaper. The \"Sentinel\" goes on to claim that her press representative remarked that her comments were \"fine as is.\" \"No, it isn't,\" the editorial read. \"It's embarrassing that a U.S. congresswoman can't get her facts straight on who's a U.S. citizen.\"\nIt still remains to be seen what avenue Rep. Brown-Waite will take next, if any, to repair the rift her remarks caused with many of her constituents."}

There were also fears that if Afflecks did remain open, \"rents would rise\".\nThese initial fears were eventually propagated closer to the end of the year when a letter from the management of Afflecks Palace told individual stall holders that \"... management have received no formal response from Bruntwood to a tenancy request notice served in October [2007]\", going on to add that \"We can only assume therefore that they do not intend to offer us a new lease\".\nFollowing the release of this letter, public support for Afflecks Palace was quickly made obvious when a 5,000 signature petition was submitted demanding the centre remain open for business. This seemed to prompt talks between Bruntwood and the Afflecks Palace management and, eventually, lead to this week's news that the market was - indeed - to remain open. The result of the talks was that Bruntwood \"bought out\" the Afflecks Palace brand. \nA joint statement between the management of Afflecks Palace and Bruntwood said: \"After 26 years of trading, Afflecks' management has sold their company to Bruntwood in an agreement that protects the future of Afflecks. Bruntwood will manage Afflecks while they look for a new owner who is skilled in running market style businesses and can bring a similar level of enthusiasm and dedication that the existing management has.\"\nA spokesperson speaking on behalf of Bruntwood also added that: \"Never in our 30 year history have we bought one of our customer's businesses, but Afflecks is a Manchester icon that we wanted to protect. We aren't however expert in managing markets, so will look for a suitable long term owner. In the meantime, the most important aspect is that we have arrived at a solution with Afflecks management that protects an independent retail environment and provides the existing stallholders with security.\"\nTraders from the market celebrated the news by holding a party yesterday."}

Wikipedia\". \nScott opened the session by sharing a disparaging quote from Robert McHenry (former editor-in-chief of Encyclopedia Britannica) comparing Wikipedia to a public restroom. He then shared a quote from Andrew Keen, author of The Cult of the Amateur, in which he stated Wikipedia is the blind leading the blind. Scott shared Wikipedia usage data from a 2007 Pew Internet study showing 36% of adults have consulted Wikipedia and that that Wikipedia receives 10,000-30,000 searches per second. Scott also pointed out that Wikipedia now has over two million articles in English alone (over nine million articles in 250 languages). So there is a discrepancy here, lots of critics and lots of use.\nScott then shared some historical information in order to provide a context for understanding Wikipedia. This included some important names and dates in the history of encyclopedias\u2026 including Pliny the Elder (23-79 C.E.) who published 37 Volumes of Natural History, and Joachim Sterck van Ringelbergh (c. 1499-1556) who first used the term encyclopedia, and then d\u2019Alembert and Diderot who published 17 volumes of their French Encyclopedia from 1751-1765. Encyclopedia Britannica was first published in Scotland in serial format 1768-1771.\nWhy history matters -- copyright and piracy, censorship, authority, organization, and content are all issues that are relevant..\nScott also discussed more recent history, sharing a photo of Ward Cunningham \u2013who is credited with being the inventor of wiki software. Wikipedia was founded on Jan 15, 2001 by Larry Sanger and Jimmy Wales. Sanger left Wikipedia in 2002 and founded Citizendium in 2007 a complementary project which now has 4500 articles.\nAfter the historical perspective, the class moved into using Wikipedia. Everyone in the audience had used Wikipedia. The class explored the content of Wikipedia, realising there is a whole lot going on. Scott demonstrated that the article about \"frogs\" for example, is semi-protected. The \"history of science\" article was examined, including the history of changes. Discussion covered how people contribute, who contributes and edits. The group also talked about Wikipedia bots, which aid in routine tasks in a semi-automated or automated fashion. \nA discussion about teachers, school media specialists and students regarding their use of Wikipedia ensued. Some teachers and school media specialists are negative about Wikipedia, but Scott's hope is that they will use it to start a discussion about the need to evaluate and critically think about information (even when it's from more traditionally reviewed and edited sources).\nAn unanswered question from an audience member was, \"What was the first Wikipedia article?\"\nDiscussion topics from Scott to audience were as follows: "}

After a request by Indian police via an Interpol \"red notice\", Canadian police located a house in Brampton owned by Kumar, who has been dubbed \"Dr. Horror\" by the Indian press.\nThe house is occupied by a woman, presumed to be his wife, and two young children. Kumar purchased the 5,600 sq ft (~510 m\u00b2) home on February 2, 2007 for C$610,000. Reportedly, additional upgrades were performed at the home, including an in-ground pool, at a cost of C$100,000. The family drives an expensive SUV. The children, two boys aged 4 and 5, are said to be enrolled at private schools.\nDr. Kumar, a nephrologist, born Santosh Rameshwar Raut, was known to his neighbors. He told them that he was a cardiovascular surgeon in India, but that he wanted to buy a hotel in Canada and, after one last trip to India to tie up loose ends, permanently relocate to Canada.\n\"We are completely shocked,\" a neighbor told the \"Toronto Star\". \"We used to joke at parties that he must be loaded to get such a beautiful wife, but nothing prepared us for this.\" Another neighbor told the paper, \"It's very unusual for someone to come here from India and buy a big house like this and a Lexus. Doctors in India just don't make that kind of money.\"\nMeanwhile, investigators are no closer to Amit Kumar, than they were a few days ago. It is widely believed that he is trying to flee India for Canada via Nepal, a country for which he is alleged to have a passport.\nPolice in Mumbai, however, believe he is still in India. \"He is very much in India,\" commissioner Rakesh Maria said on Tuesday. \"We suspect he will never leave.\"\n\"He will stay in India \u2014 it won't be easy to conduct his illegal activities anywhere else,\" he said. \"In a country like Canada, it would almost be impossible to find [kidney] donors in large numbers.\"\nHowever, after a request by the Haryana state government, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) will soon take lead in the investigation.\n\"We haven't yet received a final word to start investigations,\" CBI Director Vijay Shankar said. \"We will begin working on the case as per legal process.\" Thus far, police in Gurgoan, Moradabad, Mumbai and Rajasthan have been investigating the case separately.\nThe case has called attention to medical tourism, the practice of traveling abroad for health care at more affordable rates. Kumar is alleged to have charged US$50,000 for a kidney transplant. The donors are said to have been paid the equivalent of US$1,200. Even so, the donors, according to widespread reports and testimonials, may not have realized what they were getting into when they went with a stranger for a well-paying job.\nThe \"Toronto Star\" interviewed a medical tourism travel agent, who operates openly. Aruna Thurairajan, who runs Overseas Medical Services in Calgary, Alberta, says that she frequently gets calls from patients in need of a kidney. Thurairajan refuses to give referrals for transplants because it \"gives medical tourism a bad rap.\"\n\"Money is a big factor for people to decide where to go. Often they want to bargain how much to pay the vendor [organ donor]. Some of them can be quite selfish and mean. They think they can buy the kidney for peanuts. That's why the likes of [Amit Kumar] can prosper. So the patient should also be blamed along with him, because the patient bargains down the price,\" said Thurairajan.\nBut the victims of this illegal trade are not exclusively the poor day laborers but sometimes the clients themselves, according to a report by \"Hindustan Times\". The investigation cited a driver for a close associate of Amit Kumar and claims that at least three foreigners died on Dr. Kumar's operating table. He was able to name three Turkish nationals who all died in India between 2003 and 2005, officially from cardiac arrest. The driver, Harpal, says that the bodies were brought to a hospital in Ballabgarh, Faridabad, where the local authorities colluded with the doctors to list the cause of death as heart failure."}
