Most productions, like \"High School Musical\" and \"Degrassi: The Next Generation\", do principal photography shoots during the summer. Since the Bratz film had a summer release, and the Santee school goes year-round, such a pattern was impossible.\nDirector Sean McNamara \"was adamant about using this school\", named in the film as \"Carry Nation High\", said production designer Rusty Smith. \"We knew it was going to be complicated, and it was, but we pulled it off. I'm sure it was a big distraction for us to be there and it's really a compliment to the principal and the students\u2019 cooperation because we couldn\u2019t have done it without them.\"\nOne of the stars, Chelsea Staub, agreed. \"I was amazed at how orderly and respectful the students at Santee High were during our invasion.\" She admits that she \"would have had issues walking by our heavenly omelet station every morning,\" if she were a Santee student.\nSuch good behavior could be deemed extra surprising considering the school, which opened in 2005, is located in an area known for its amount of gangs. Some students walk through 50 different gang \"territories\" on the way to school, 18 of which have documented members enrolled as students. Students have brought AK-47s to class, and jumped police officers for their guns. A two day melee at the school, whose principal is a former cop, resulted in 34 arrests and 10 hospitalizations, mostly for pepper-spray-related injuries. Half of the instructors, as of March 2006, were in their first year of teaching.\nThe school board superintendent and Los Angeles mayor Antonio Villaraigosa rode the bus to the first day the bus was routed through the neighbourhood; a photographer for the \"Los Angeles Times\" caught a 10th grader tagging a window. The first gun shots rang out the second day the school was open.\n\"Bratz: The Movie\" is a story based on an internationally successful line of dolls. Three \"best friends forever\" are forced by the queen bee of the high school to separate into various existing cliques. Growing lonely, they rebel by choosing to be true to themselves.\n\"Filming at a real high school was interesting because you could see real cliques and compare them to the simulated cliques in the movie,\" commented Logan Browning, one of the movie's stars, herself a senior in high school.\nStaub, who plays the antagonist Meredith, also felt the real-life location was beneficial to the movie. \"All the sounds and background images helped make it real for me. The shifting echoes of students on the bleachers and school bells that released the chaos of kids changing classes made me feel like I was truly a part of the high school experience as opposed to doing a scene on a soundstage.\"\n\"The presence of that school and the way it's laid out, almost like a prison, became a major character in the film,\" said production designer Rusty Smith. (Interestingly, Meredith's mantra in the movie is \"take no prisoners\".) The school, devoid of color, easily contrasted against the vibrant and unique bedrooms of the Bratz girls. \"We knew it was going to be complicated and it was but we pulled it off. I'm sure it was a big distraction for us to be there and it's really a compliment to the principal and the students' cooperation because we couldn't have done it without them.\"\nA 16-foot high sculpture was added to the school courtyard, to help transform it into Carry Nation. The sculpture was of Nation, the most infamous and formidable member of the Women's Christian Temperance Union in pre-prohibition America, wielding her hatchet in one hand and Bible in the other.\nThe production also filmed in the residential neighborhood of Studio City, and The Grove, a popular shopping centre at the heart of West Hollywood, both areas of Los Angeles.\nThe film opens in theaters across the United States and Canada on August 3, in the United Kingdom on August 17, in Spain on August 24, and Australia and New Zealand September 20.\nSources.\n "}

After the crash, the air show's announcer (also a pastor) led the crowd in a prayer for Jim's survival and healing. LeRoy died while the helicopter was making its way to Miami Valley Hospital.\nThe portion of the show was just prior to when the Thunderbirds would have flown, who stepped down to allow airport security and the TSA and FAA to conduct their investigation. Videos of the crash were requested by the agencies. The show was then closed for the day, to allow the investigation to continue, and airport police stood by to \"remove cars as fast as possible.\""}

Ltd. in India. Although the toothpaste is not approved for sale in Canada, it has been found on store shelves in Western and Atlantic Canada. It is also possible, though not confirmed, that the product may be found in stores across Canada.\nToothpastes that have been approved for sale in Canada will have on the packaging either an eight-digit Drug Identification Number (DIN) or a Natural Product Number (NPN).\nConsumers have been advised by Health Canada to discontinue use of the suspect toothpaste and ensure that the product remains out of the reach of children. As per Health Canada instructions, consumers are to return the toothpaste to the store from which they purchased it.\nHealth Canada describes DEG as \"a poisonous chemical used in antifreeze and as a solvent. It may cause nausea, abdominal pain, dizziness, urinary problems, kidney failure, breathing problems, lethargy, convulsions, coma and even death when ingested.\" DEG has been used by makers of counterfeit products as a cheaper alternative to using common sweeteners.\nTo date, Health Canada has not been made aware of anyone becoming sick from using \"India Neem Active Toothpaste with Calcium\".\nThere is an increased concern for DEG-containing toothpaste with respect to its use by children. While most adults do not ingest toothpaste, it is often swallowed by young children. Chronic exposure to DEG, according to Health Canada, \"is a particular concern in specific vulnerable populations such as children and consumers with kidney or liver disease.\"\nThis current warning from Health Canada follows a similar recall of 24 brands of toothpaste from China, including some counterfeit Colgate brands, which were found to contain not only DEG, but also high levels of a harmful bacteria from the Enterobacteriaceae family.

He was 89. The exact cause of death is not known.\n\"It's an unbelievable loss for Sweden, but even more so internationally,\" Astrid S\u00f6derbergh Widding, president of The Ingmar Bergman Foundation, told \"Associated Press\".\n\"This is an enormous loss, not only for artistic Sweden but because he was one of the most well-known Swedes in the world,\" Jon Asp, a spokesperson for the Ingmar Bergman Foundation, said in a telephone interview with \"Bloomberg\". \"Had it not been for his struggles in the 40s and 50s, Swedish directors such as Jan Troell and Bo Widerberg may not have been able to make films.\"\n\"He was one of the world's biggest personalities. There were Kurosawa, Fellini and then Bergman. Now he is also gone,\" Danish director Bille August said to \"Associated Press\". \"It is a great loss. I am in shock.\"\nHungarian director Istv\u00e1n Szab\u00f3 told \"MTI\": \"The Bergman films are to viewers like the novels of a great novelist, the poems of a great poet or the works of a great drama writer ... He valued contact with the audience very much and the story which can be told to them, while he did not attribute a great value to stories which can only be understood by snobs and highly qualified aesthetes.\"\nBiography.\nBorn Ernst Ingmar Bergman in 1918 in Uppsala, Sweden to a Lutheran minister of Danish descent, Bergman grew up surrounded by religious imagery and discussion. He had a strict upbringing and went through two five-month stretches of mandatory military service. He attended Stockholm High School and Stockholm University, without completing his degree in literature and art. He instead became interested in theatre and later in film.\nDespite his devout upbringing, Bergman said that he lost his faith at age eight but did not come to terms with this until later in his filmmaking career.\nSince the early sixties Bergman lived much of his life on the island of F\u00e5r\u00f6, where he made a number of his films. In 2004 he said he would never again leave the island.\nHe was married five times and had nine children.\nCareer.\nAlthough Bergman was universally famous for his contribution to cinema, he was an active and productive stage director all his life, and was manager and director of a number of the most prestigious theatres in Sweden.\nAs a director, Bergman favored intuition over intellect, and chose to be unaggressive in dealing with actors. Bergman saw himself as having a great responsibility toward them, viewing them as collaborators often in a psychologically vulnerable position. He stated that a director must be both honest and supportive in order to allow others their best work.\nHis films usually deal with existential questions of mortality, loneliness, and faith; they also tend to be direct and not overtly stylized. \"Persona\", one of Bergman's most famous films, is unusual among Bergman's work in being both existentialist and avant-garde.\nBergman usually wrote his own scripts, thinking about them for months or years before starting the actual process of writing, which he viewed as somewhat tedious. His earlier films are carefully structured, and are either based on his plays or written in collaboration with other authors.\nBergman stated that in his later works, when on occasion his actors would want to do things differently from his own intentions, he would let them, noting that the results were often \"disastrous\" when he did not do so. As his career progressed, Bergman increasingly let his actors improvise their dialogue. In his latest films, he wrote just the ideas informing the scene and allowed his actors to determine exact dialogue.\nSelected filmography.\nIngmar Bergman, who made over 50 films, rarely watched them. \"I don't watch my own films very often. I become so jittery and ready to cry ... and miserable. I think it's awful,\" Bergman said."}

Bush at Camp David in Maryland for their first formal talks since Brown took office in June.\nGordon Brown arrived at Camp David on Sunday, July 30. Monday, they addressed the press in a joint press conference. According to reports, the talks focused on Iraq, Afghanistan, Darfur, world trade and climate change, amid speculation whether the two leaders could work together. Correspondents say they appeared relaxed as they faced reporters after their talks.\n \nBoth reiterated a commitment to fighting terrorism, which Prime Minister Brown called \"a crime against humanity\", and discussed ways of making sure that the two countries' security systems are \"properly aligned\" and share information.\nPresident Bush spoke of waging an ideological struggle between those who \"believe in freedom and justice and human rights and human dignity, and cold-blooded killers who will kill innocent people to achieve their objectives\" and said that defending the \"young democracies\" of Afghanistan and Iraq was a way to defeat \"an ideology of darkness\" with a \"more hopeful ideology\". \n\"It's very important for us to make it clear to those who are in harm's way that these missions will be driven not by local politics but by conditions on the ground,\" the President added.\nIraq.\nPrime Minister Brown acknowledged a responsibility to support the Iraqi government and said the U.S. and the U.K. had a threefold aim: security for the Iraqi people, political reconciliation, and a stake for Iraqis in their future. \nThe Prime Minister spoke of a step by step transfer of control to the Iraqi government and security forces, with the British forces moving from a combat to overwatch mode in three of the four provinces under their responsibility. He said military commanders will determine when a similar transition will be made for the remaining province - Basra and that the recommendation will be placed before parliament. The head of the British military said last week that that the transfer is likely by the year end. \nSeven of Iraq's 18 provinces, mostly in the Shia dominated south and the Kurdish north, are now formally under the control of Iraqi government and security forces. On being asked if U.S. deployment will continue till after the presidential elections next year, President Bush reiterated that this was going to take a long time, and said he will not prejudge a report by U.S. Commander in Iraq, General David Petraeus, on how the recent troop 'surge' has altered the security situation.\nUK Prime Minister proposed setting up a Basra economic development agency to bring jobs and businesses - \"economic hope\" for the region, and offered financial support for the project. \nDarfur, Iran and the Middle East.\nBoth leaders expressed strong concern over the situation in Darfur, and agreed to step up pressure to end the violence in the region by expediting a U.N. resolution mandating a U.N.-African Union peace force. \nMeanwhile, at the U.N. Security Council, a revised draft resolution is being circulated today that drops language critical of Sudan government forces and scales back the peace-keeping force's mandate to monitor arms violation, following Sudan's objections. The peacekeeping force is to assume responsibility by the year's end but it will take up to a year to be fully deployed.\n\"We're agreed on encouragement for early peace talks, a call to cease violence on the ground, an end to aerial bombing of civilians, and support for economic development if this happens, and further sanctions if this does not happen.\", Prime Minister Brown said.\nPrime Minister Brown expressed support for President Bush's \"bold initiative\" in the Middle East peace process and said the two leaders agreed that sanctions against Iran were working and that they were prepared to toughen sanction with a new U.N. resolutions. \nTrade and aid.\nBoth leaders expressed support for measures to combat poverty, lack of education and healthcare, particularly malaria and HIV/AIDS, including ways to bring public and private sectors, faith groups and civil society to achieve the Millennium Development Goals.\nPrime Minister Brown, who has already spoken to several leaders around the world regarding the Doha round of trade talks, said contact between world leaders will be stepped up to quickly reach an agreement, which both leaders stressed was an important goal that they were optimistic of attaining.\nClimate change was an important issue and needs to be tackled in the context of sustainable development as well as energy security, Prime Minister Brown said, and said that this agenda, agreed at this year's G8 in Germany, would be discussed in meetings over the next few months."}

The Copyright (New Technologies and Performers' Rights) Amendment Bill now makes this legal as long as there is only one copy for anyone in the same household, the original CD is kept and it is not sold. The bill had previously included time restrictions for this, but they have now been removed.\nThe report also wishes the bill to be amended to give more power to the copyright holders. The proposed amendment would allow the copyright holders to decide whether or not they wish their works to be exempt under the new, proposed law. The only condition is that the consumers are informed of this decision.\nCommentators have cried out against this, they state that there is not much of a point if they can decide not to be applicable to the law.

A conviction would pose either a NZ$150,000 fine or five years in jail.\nDavidson says that InternetNZ does not support the bill in its amended form by the committee. \"Overall, the Bill as reported back does contain improvements on the draft.

The UN Security Council voted unanimously to send troops to the region.\nAt least 200,000 people have been killed in four years of fighting in the region and more than two million have been displaced. \nTroops will be sent to the region under Chapter 7 of the UN charter which states that the UN \"shall determine the existence of any threat to the peace, breach of the peace, or act of aggression and shall make recommendations, or decide what measures shall be taken to maintain or restore international peace and security.\" \nLanguage authorizing the troops to seize illegal weapons caches and mentions of possible future sanctions if Sudan does not co-operate was removed during negotiations. The resolution does allow troops to monitor weapon caches. \n\"If any party blocks progress and the killings continue, I and others will redouble our efforts to impose further sanctions. The plan for Darfur from now on is to achieve a cease-fire, including an end to aerial bombings of civilians; drive forward peace talks ... and, as peace is established, offer to begin to invest in recovery and reconstruction,\" said the new British Prime Minister Gordon Brown on Tuesday while visiting the UN headquarters in New York.\nTroops are expected to be in the region no later than December of this year but may take up to a year to fully deploy. This will be the largest peacekeeping force ever deployed and cost over US$2 billion per year to keep the force in the region.

They include having more of a \"say\" in the security and protection of Iraq, and call for the release of prisoners who are not being charged with crimes.\n\"The government is continuing with its arrogance, refusing to change its stand and has slammed shut the door to any meaningful reforms necessary for saving Iraq.

Tim Dolan, the Minneapolis Police Chief later stated that \"several [adding to the four] people are confirmed dead at the scene,\" but would not elaborate on how many. At least 79 have been injured and at least 8 are still missing, still believed to be in the rubble. \nThe road was busy with bumper-to-bumper traffic in four lanes when the entire 1907 foot (581 m) steel arch bridge collapsed. At least 50 cars were traveling on the bridge, including a school bus. The Red Cross said that 60 children were aboard a school bus, and that ten of those were admitted to a hospital. \nThe entire length of the bridge over the river collapsed at 6:05 p.m. CDT (UTC-5). The bridge, built in 1967, cleared the water level by 64 feet; the deck surface and pavement were considerably higher.\nReports say that people may be trapped in the water. Further, \"many voids may contain survivors, but we cannot search those voids until it's safe,\" said Jim Clack, Minneapolis Fire Chief, during a press conference. \n\"One has died from drowning,\" said a doctor from the medical center during an 8:00 pm press conference, who also said that so far 22 are in \"yellow condition\" and at least six are in \"critical condition.\" \nMinneapolis officials have stated during an earlier press conference that \"people are being sent downtown and all survivors are off the bridge. We are seeking help from the Red Cross.\" and \"[...]at least 60 children are receiving trauma care some with severe injures, some with minor injuries.\"\nMost of the injured have been received by Hennepin County Medical Center in downtown Minneapolis for medical treatment. Area hospitals are requesting all off duty staff and all Minneapolis ambulances to report. Residents are being encouraged to stay away from the area to let emergency crews do their work.\nIt is not known what caused the collapse, but there was construction being performed on the bridge's road surface which included the use of jackhammers and the FBI has ruled out terrorism.\n\"Although it is much too early to make any determination of the cause, we have no reason at this time to believe there is any nexus to terrorism,\" said Paul McCabe, an FBI spokesman.\nIn 2001 a stress inspection was done and Minnesota Department of Transportation stated that the bridge \"should not have any problems with fatigue cracking in the foreseeable future.\"\nTypically an eight-lane bridge, the bridge was reduced to four lanes (two in each direction) during the current construction. The Minnesota Department of Transportation (Mn/DOT) had just announced overnight lane reductions on the bridge to one lane in each direction for the late evening hours of July 31 and August 1.\nMayor's Statement.\nR. T. Rybak, the Mayor of Minneapolis, has issued a statement, posted on the front page of his website saying, \"Our heartfelt grief goes out to the families and loved ones of those who perished in tonight's I-35W bridge collapsed [sic] over the Mississippi River. The impact of this tragic disaster is felt by every resident of Minneapolis as we pray for those lost to this terrible accident.\n\"We are deeply grateful to Minneapolis' brave emergency first responders who risked their lives to immediately respond to this disaster and rescue those caught in the collapse. Their dedication and service will not be forgotten.\n\"I am directing every available City resource to guarantee that our emergency response teams work to ensure that nearby infrastructure, streets and bridges are safe. We will also work with our state and federal partners to complete a full and thorough investigation into the cause off [sic] this disaster.\"\nU.S. President and Transportation Secretary remarks.\nUnited States President George W. Bush said in a press conference at 10:50 a.m. (eastern time), \"I understand what it is like to carry the burden of grieving people. We are in prayer for those who suffered. I thank my fellow citizens for helping those who are suffering. We in the federal government must respond and respond robustly to help the people there not only recover but to make sure that lifeline of activity, that bridge, gets rebuilt as quickly as possible.\"\nMary E. Peters, the Secretary of Transportation, arrived in the Minneapolis area to survey the damage caused by the collapse.\n\"We will take every step possible to make sure something like this will never happen again,\" said Peters who also stated that at least US$5 million is set aside to clean up the wreckage and to help with rebuilding the flow of traffic in the area. Peters later signed off on an advisory to the Federal Highway Administration. It urges state transportation departments to do inspections on bridges, similar to the one which just collapsed in Minneapolis.\nDetour Routes Announced.\nThe Minnesota Department of Transportation is urging commuters to follow signed detours around the collapsed bridge. The official detour will be to use Minnesota Highway 280 and Interstate 94 to bypass the damaged section of Interstate 35W. Highway 280 will be temporarily converted to freeway operation by closing the intersection at Broadway Ave. and County Road B and green lighting all highway 280 traffic through that intersection. Interstate 35W will be closed between the Mississippi River and Stinson/New Brighton Blvd. The northbound lanes of 35W north of Interstate 94 will also be closed.\nBus service altered.\nMetro Transit announced that extra buses will be added north of Minneapolis due to the altered traffic situation. Additional buses will run from 6 am to 9 am at the following park-and-ride locations:\nMinnesota Twins.\nA baseball game between the Minnesota Twins and the Kansas City Royals was minutes from starting when the nearby bridge collapsed. Because most of the fans were already at the stadium, it was decided to play the game because releasing thousands of cars would greatly interfere with the numerous rescue vehicles at work in the area. There was a moment of prayer held before the Wednesday game and fans were encouraged to stay off their cell phones. Most of the rescue work had been completed before the game ended. Thursday's Twins-Royals game, as well as the ceremonial ground-breaking for their new ball park, have been postponed due to the collapse. Minneapolis officials earlier stated the \"Metrodome is safe.\"\nExternal links.\n __NOEDITSECTION__"}

The Community of Christ is seeking a preliminary injunction, which would prevent use of the name until the case is settled. \nSeveral other Restoration Branches have also been using the name but no legal action has been taken against them at this time.\nThe Joint Conference of Restoration Branches voted in April this year to use the RLDS name, as recommended by their Succession Committee. It is not yet known whether the Raytown South Branch is associated with this effort or whether this will effect any other Restoration Branches who are or have been using the RLDS name.\nThe Reorganized Church, founded in 1860 by Joseph Smith III grew out of the original Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints founded by Joseph Smith Jr. in 1830. Historically, the RLDS have claimed to believe in the original tenets of the Latter Day Saint movement, and do not adhere to major Mormon doctrines. \nIn the 1980s, a split occurred between conservative and liberal factions resulting in the \"RLDS\" which subsequently renamed itself the \"Community of Christ\" and which up to recent times has been uncontested as the legal successor to the original RLDS church, and the Restoration Branches, a scattered group of local churches who became separate from the main organization in protest of what they saw as incorrect changes to fundamental doctrines. \nMany members of Restoration Branches believe they have been disenfranchised in church government by the Community of Christ, citing the rights of branches listed in the \"Articles of Incorporation of the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints.\" (1872) They argue that the methods employed to institute a policy called \"Supreme Directional Control\" violated the branches and individual members rights to voice and vote in the deliberative assemblies of church government."}

The Mir-1 and a second Mir-2 submarine face the challenge of diving 13,980 feet (4,261 metres) deep, and then having to resurface at the exact location where they've submerged, because they are not strong enough to penetrate the ice themselves. The nuclear ice-breaker vessel Rossiya is keeping the ice open for the research ship and the submarines.\nThe expedition ship Akademik Fyodorov is carrying over 100 scientists to the North Pole. \"Apart from the purely scientific goal of a comprehensive study of the climate and seabed at the North Pole, this expedition may help Russia to enlarge its territory by more than one million square kilometers,\" the Russia's Arctic and Antarctic Research Institute said.

Canada, the United States, Norway and Denmark (through Greenland) have an Exclusive Economic Zone 200 miles north of their Arctic coastline, established under international laws. Russia is claiming a larger area, extending to the North Pole, saying that a continental shelf called the Lomonosov Ridge runs from Siberia on the Arctic seabed to the North Pole. As such, it would be an extension of Russian territory.\nIn 2001, Russia made a case with the United Nations to extend its boundaries to the Arctic, but the U.N. requested more scientific data to strengthen the Russian case. The current mission is collecting evidence to submit another request in 2009, under the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea. Canada and Denmark last year sent out a joint mission to establish whether the Lomonosov Ridge is connected to their territories, and Norway is investigating this possibility too.

There are over 100 presenters holding a total of 65 sessions.\nFlorence Devouard, Chair of the Wikimedia Foundation, in the opening to the conference, reviewed what has been accomplished in the past year. Among the accomplishments are the creation of the Wikimedia Taiwan chapter, and the creation of Wikiversity. Florence also said that the Russian Wikipedia was the fastest growing Wikipedia, with the Chinese Wikipedia coming second. There still is huge disparity in language though, with projects such as the Afrikaans Wikipedia having 6 million native speakers, but less than 8,000 articles\nAn estimation of the current total assets of the foundation was stated to be around $3.5 million. Florence Devouard also discussed the need for scalable sources of revenue for the foundation. These sources, she stressed, must be consistent with the foundation's non profit status, with the open/free content movement and with community wishes. Potential revenue sources include the continued sale of live datafeeds, a print on demand service, board games, puzzles and other merchandising. She stated that the foundation will not sell DVDs or paper versions due to legal risks.\nAlso, Jimmy Wales, in the press conference, mentioned that in mainland China, lots of media or information is still unfree or not to be unveiled, such as Baido.com, so that may restrict the development or providing of freely contents and correct information, and is surely not a good example. And then he'll come to visit mainland China to solve those problems of freely contents developments.\nOther speakers included Benjamin Mako Hill discussing the definition of free culture, Kat Walsh on Wikimedia foundation use of free content, Samuel Klein on the one laptop per child and addressing systemic bias, Jimmy Wales, Angela Beesley and Gil Penchina on Wikia."}

During a recent interview, Mr. McCormick compared the ten major interconnected power regions that comprise the \"North American Grid\", to a string of Christmas lights that\u2019s been active non-stop since the 1950s. Mr. McCormick's qualifications include being a licensed red seal interprovincial/interstate electrical engineer and he's worked at numerous power generating stations mainly in Canada, but also across the U.S. He's participated in building regional infrastructure related to both generation and distribution. Additionally, Mr. McCormick is Orange Level qualified as an Atomic Radiation Worker (ARW) registered in Geneva, Switzerland.\nMr. McCormick offered his candid assessment of today\u2019s continental \"power grid\" by making several observations about this critical, civilization-supporting industry. His power plant experience includes both nuclear and coal, and he\u2019s a certified expert in alternative fuel technologies such as wind, solar and hydrogen. He said that, from nuclear to coal, the majority of power generating plants operating across North America have momentous deficiencies, and the collective 10-region \u201cpower grid\u201d has not been maintained properly (across the board) since the 1960s. Population growth has created a state in which North American power consumption is far greater than what is being yielded by current technological capacity to generate consumable energy. Mr. McCormick indicated that the infamous August 2003 blackout, in which the Northeastern U.S., Mid-Eastern U.S. and most of Ontario suffered stifling, life-interrupting blackouts, was just the beginning of something much more significant. In reference to the \"North American Power Grid Initiative\", he said that it\u2019s nothing more than a case of, \"too little, too late\".\n\"You\u2019re frequently seeing substandard parts and equipment being employed, on sites across the continent, and being used for sensitive construction projects, often related to components integral to the grid system itself. North American nuclear energy generating plants are among the worst when it comes to safety violations, not only endangering on-site employees with blatant disregard but also literally thousands of people with regard to unregulated, unnoticed pollution and waste being dumped in rivers, lakes and oceans, into the atmosphere and, more specifically, our entire ecosystem,\" said McCormick.\nMr. McCormick strongly feels that another major breakdown of the grid system may occur by the end of this year, and he further stated that he\u2019s also concerned that domestic power grid system is in grave danger of being undermined by terrorists."}

We would never take it lightly to send astronauts to the underside of the vehicle to do anything,\" said the mission management team chairman, John Shannon who also said that until the damage is inspected, \"it's way too early to determine whether any repairs are required.\"\nIf the damage is found to be irreversible and cannot be fixed, the crew of Endeavour would stay on the ISS. NASA says that supplies would last until a rescue mission could be launched October 8 by sending up Discovery.\nDuring lift off of Endeavour on August 8, cameras had shown moisture which had gathered on the camera's lens, but NASA states that the object which caused the damage was not caught on camera. At least nine pieces of debris were reported to have been filmed while the shuttle took off, but NASA says that only three of those pieces of debris had a possibility of hitting the shuttle.\nAstronauts are expected to use a laser that is attached to the shuttle's robotic arm to measure the exact depth and size of the gouge on Sunday. The tile could be repaired by affixing a metal plate over the tile, filling it with putty, or sealing the gouge."}

The draw means that India win the Test series in England 1-0.\nThis is India's first series win in England since 1986 and England's first home series loss since 2001. \nIn the at Lord's, England started off the match with a first innings of 298, then bowling India out for 201. England then followed that up with a score of 282. India then worked their way to 282/9 before the weather turned for the worse and rain came to their rescue and ended the first test as a draw.\nThe proved a better one for India where the left-arm seamers dominated. After England had been shot out for 198, India took the advantage by starting their innings with a 147 run opening partnership, and India didn't look back. They ended their innings with a score of 481. There could have been centuries had it not been for two horrible umpiring decisions which left Tendulkar on 91 after being wrongly adjudged lbw and Sourav Ganguly was left on 79 after missing a ball going down the leg-side but which the umpire thought he nicked. After England had been bowled out for 355, India went in for the kill and won the Test. There were also several behavioral problems, including Sreesanth's shoulder barge into Michael Vaughan which cost Sreesanth half of his match fee and the jelly bean scandal in which the England players allegedly put jelly beans on the pitch to distract Zaheer Khan. This would prove costly however, as Zaheer Khan got fired up and then went on to take 9 wickets in the match.\nThe third Test proved to be a closer game. Having won the toss and chosen to bat, India racked up a massive 664 in their first innings which included eight half-century partnerships, a first in Tests, and Anil Kumble's maiden Test century. England were then bowled out for 345, well short of the total needed to avoid a possible follow-on, with Ian Bell top scoring with 63. Paul Collingwood and Alastair Cook followed with 62 and 61 respectively. \nIndia though, did not enforce the follow-on and opted to bat again. India stuttered to 11/3, losing both opening batsmen within the first four overs, followed by the wicket of Sachin Tendulkar for just one run. Sourav Ganguly and Rahul Dravid however steadied the innings. Ganguly had the highest score of the innings with 57 while Dravid was uncharacteristically slow and scored 12 runs off 96 balls. \nIndia declared on 180/6, setting England a massive target of 500 runs. England then batted out the remaining 110 overs of the match to score 369/6, including a century from Kevin Pietersen, ending the match as a draw.\nA seven-match One-Day International series will be played between the two countries following the Test series, with the first to take place at the Rose Bowl, Hampshire on 21st August.\n&lt;br&gt;\nEngland: A J Strauss, A N Cook, M P Vaughan (capt), K P Pietersen, P D Collingwood, I R Bell, M J Prior (wkt), C T Tremlett, R J Sidebottom, M S Panesar, J M Anderson&lt;br&gt;\nIndia: W Jaffer, K D Karthik, R Dravid (capt), S R Tendulkar, S C Ganguly, V V S Laxman, M S Dhoni (wkt), A Kumble, Z Khan, R P Singh, S Sreesanth&lt;br&gt;\nPlayer of the Match: A Kumble (India)&lt;br&gt;\nPlayers of the Series: J M Anderson (England) and Z Khan (India)&lt;br&gt;\nUmpires: S A Bucknor (West Indies) and I L Howell (South Africa)&lt;br&gt;\nTV umpire: P J Hartley&lt;br&gt;\nMatch referee: R S Madugalle (Sri Lanka)&lt;br&gt;\nReserve umpire: J W Lloyds"}

Those interviewed were Sue Kedgley, Jonathan Coleman, and Steve Maharey, the broadcasting spokespeople for their respective parties; the Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand, the New Zealand National Party, and the New Zealand Labour Party.\nFreeview, modelled after the United Kingdom's Freeview, is competing directly with New Zealand's only other digital pay TV provider, Sky Network Television. Sky reaches around 44.5% of New Zealand households. However, unlike Sky, Freeview has no on-going subscription fees, and only has a one-off fee for a set-top box and, if needed, a satellite dish.\nThe Labour-led Government has provided Freeview with around NZ$25 million over a five-year period to help New Zealand change from the old analogue technology and align itself \"as the rest of the world moves to digital television broadcasting,\" Mr Maharey said. The funding use is monitored by the Ministry for Culture and Heritage. Dr Coleman also described the same reasons why Freeview was necessary for New Zealand and is supported by the National Party.\nHowever, Ms Kedgley takes a different approach and describes the Freeview service as \"a belated and inadequate response to the digital challenge\", but does state that digital TV is the \"growth area.\" She also said that the Government is now trying to catch up after they scrapped TVNZ's (Television New Zealand) digital plan, which she describes as far more ambitious.\nNational, despite being supportive of Freeview, think that the Government has not done a good job with Freeview, describing it as a \"white elephant\". Firstly because Dr Coleman says there isn't enough good programming currently available to get people interested in switching, and, secondly, there hasn't been a definite date when analogue transmission will be cut off.\nMr Maharey said that the Government is engaging various broadcasters and interested parties to get a definite analogue switch off date, and talk about other various regulatory factors. He expects the date to be within the next six to ten years.\nWhile the Greens do welcome the new government-funded TVNZ channels, a news and current affairs channel and a family-related channel (TVNZ 7 and TVNZ 6 respectively), \"The whole exercise however, smacks of too little, too late.\" They also say that the amount of funding allocated to new programming cannot pose a threat to Sky. But do support \"packaging and marketing [...] existing TVNZ content on the emerging digital platforms.\" MediaWorks, which runs TV3 and C4, will announce their two new channels in around 18-months. And Triangle TV will add their own channel, Stratos TV, in October, 2007.\nNational are questioning Mr Maharey why he hadn't released the viewer number figures. Dr Coleman said that Mr Maharey was trying to distance himself away from the \"reality\" of what was going on. So \"Wikinews\" requested, under the Official Information Act, the amount of set-top boxes sold. The request was denied as Freeview was to release the information themselves in a months time. On August 13 the figures were released, with a total over 21,000. General Manager Steve Browning said that \u201cwe're tracking well ahead of forecast\u201d. Mr Maharey concurred with what Mr Browning said, saying it exceeds their first year expectations.\nMs Kedgley, Dr Coleman, and Mr Maharey all say that they don't have Freeview, nor know anyone who has the service. Though, Mr Maharey will consider getting it when more channels and the 2008 terrestrial service is launched in eight major New Zealand cities."}

The claim is made by Gunter Nimtz and Alfons Stahlhofen, both of the University of Koblenz.\nThe pair claim that in an experiment they set up, microwave photons travelled \"instantaneously\" between two prisms that had been moved apart to distances ranging from a few millimetres to three feet. According to Einstein's calculations, to propel an object faster than the speed of light - which is about 300,000 kilometres per second (186,000 miles per second) - would require an infinite amount of energy.\nThe scientists originally began experimenting with the prisms placed against each other to form a 40 cm cube. They then passed microwaves of wavelength 30 cm through the prisms. As they moved the prisms apart, some of them were refracted, and some, as predicted, began quantum tunnelling across the gap. The scientists say that both the refracted and the tunneling particles reached the detectors set up for each at the same time, suggesting the tunnelling photons had jumped the gap at significantly beyond the speed of light.\nThe duo were conducting various experiments in quantum tunnelling, a bizarre phenomenon which allows sub-atomic particles to behave in manners that are apparently impossible. Quantum tunnelling occurs when photons cross over a seemingly uncrossable barrier. However, Nimtz said of his discovery to the New Scientist magazine \"For the time being, this is the only violation of special relativity that I know of.\"\nSome sources believe the pair misinterpreted their results, citing another phenomenon, known as the Hartman Effect. This effect predicts that \"the tunneling (sic) time becomes independent of barrier length for thick enough barriers, ultimately resulting in unbounded tunneling (sic) velocities\", i.e. an individual photon may appear to be travelling at significantly beyond the speed of light. And research published by Herbert G Winful of the University of Michigan casts further doubt on the claim, stating that unusually brief delays in tunnelling \"should not be linked to a velocity since evanescent waves do not propagate\".\nExternal links.\n "}

Over 250 Army, Navy and Air Force personnel left for London on Sunday 5 November, the contingent comprises a Royal Guard, Cataflaque Party, Maori Cultural Group and tri-Service Band.\nNew Zealand Prime Minister Helen Clark said she hoped it could be a part of London that New Zealanders could always call home.\n\"It's genesis lay in the desire to commemorate the shared sacrifice of New Zealanders in times of war, alongside the people of Britain,\" Helen Clark said.\n\"New Zealand's relationship with Britain dated back to the 18th century, and Captain James Cook's exploration of New Zealand,\" she said.\nBritish Prime Minister Tony Blair said the link between the two nations was not just historic. \"The bonds of friendship between our two countries, remain as strong as ever. Our peoples are close, they come and go between our two countries as much as ever, we invest in each others' economies, we share culture and sport - where friends become rivals.\" \nDesigned by architect John Hardwick-Smith and sculptor Paul Dibble the memorial consists of 16 cross-shaped vertical bronze 'standards' set out in formation on a grassy slope. Each standard is adorned with text, patterns and small sculptures. \"Through the words and images, any New Zealander visiting the memorial will recognise home, and British people may learn something of the relationship between our two countries,\" explains Paul Dibble.\n\"We set the memorial in a position where the main pedestrian route runs through the memorial so that visitors will walk amongst the sculptures, encouraging people to stop and explore. Through the words and images, any New Zealander visiting the memorial will recognise home, and British people may learn something of the relationship between our two countries.\" \nThe memorial is located at Hyde Park Corner, diagonally opposite the Australian War Memorial which was completed in 2003. \nIn October 2004, 12 designs teams were selected from the 68 who submitted expressions of interest. These teams submitted designs for the memorial, and an expert panel, appointed by the Ministry for Culture and Heritage, selected the final design. The memorial design is a collaboration between Dibble Art Co and Athfield Architects, led by sculptor Paul Dibble and architect John Hardwick-Smith, with Jon Rennie as the team's London representative."}

The first fire, caused by a short circuit, damaged five floors, burning from floors 12 to 16. The building is 17 stories high.\nToday's fire destroyed seven more floors, starting on the 4th around 2:30 p.m. and being propelled up to the 10th by strong winds in the area. The deceased was a male shipping company official, who was assisting efforts to extinguish the blaze. According to the \"International Herald Tribune\", he lost consciousness after inhaling smoke and fumes, and was pronounced dead on arrival after being rushed to hospital. However, The \"Hindu News\" reports that officials said he died near the scene from a heart attack, brought on by the ensuing disaster. The \"Hindu News\" also gives his name and occupation as Vijay Kumar, an administrator and manager employed by the PNSC.\nFour firefighters received injuries from falling glass shards and other assorted debris. One technician was trapped on the roof where he had been performing maintenance on a communications tower installed there. He was rescued by one of two navy helicopters dispatched to the scene. In addition to the helicopters, 115 firefighters and 25 fire engines from the city fire brigade and the Karachi Port Trust attended, as well as a number of ambulances from relief organizations.\nIt is reported by some that the likely cause of the fire was another electrical short circuit, similar to the one that triggered February's fire. However, Pakistan's Minister for Shipping and Ports Babar Ghouri said that subversive or terrorist activity could not be ruled out and it was strange that the last time a blaze broke out in the building was also a Sunday. \"We are going to carry out a full-scale investigation into this fire because they are certain things that appear strange,\" Ghouri said.\nSources.\n "}

He faked a legal judgment and sent it to a father who was pleading in Taunton family court to be able to remain involved in his child's upbringing. The lawyer, London barrister Bruce Hyman, now awaits his sentence. The judge indicated that he could receive a prison sentence. Bruce Hyman is well-known in media circles, having produced \"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\" on BBC Radio. He also produced a series with Clive Anderson, at Above the Title Productions, called \"Unreliable Evidence\".\nThe father, a former City financier, had attended a series of court hearings in order to make suitable arrangements to see his child following an acrimonious divorce. Shortly before one of these hearings he received an email, ostensibly from a self-help group to which he belonged, which had attached a Court of Appeal case that appeared favourable to an application he had made for the judge to stand down from the case. The father, who was representing himself, duly showed the case to the judge. At this point, Bruce Hyman, the lawyer representing the former wife, claimed to the judge that the case was a forgery, which indeed it turned out to be.\nAfter confirming that the self-help group had not sent him the email, the father then embarked on some detective work his own. The fraudulent email was traced via its header to a dial-up internet connection and a phone number belonging to a shop in London. The shop was able to recover CCTV footage which showed a man sending the email from an Apple laptop. The man turned out to be Bruce Hyman.\nSentencing of Hyman is due in Bristol Crown Court on the 19th of September."}

Another man had to be rescued from the roof via helicopter. 31 people were in the office at the time of the fire, including eight PNSC security guards and six other PNSC personnel, the rest working for private companies.\nThe provincial investigation team's findings are expected to be announced in around fifteen days. In addition, the Karachi Building Control Authority and several private organizations have been asked to inspect the building, and the course of action to be taken regarding the site will be determined after they have submitted their reports. \u201cEven if the current PNSC building is demolished, it will be replaced by another PNSC building. The plot will not be given to anyone else,\u201d Ghauri said.\n\u201cI have spoken to the prime minister on the telephone. I told him that the incident should be investigated by independent parties and ministry personnel should not be part of these investigation teams,\u201d Ghauri said. Meanwhile, the Senate Standing Committee on Ports and Shipping confirmed that they will send a team to assist in investigative efforts.\nThe fire, which consumed floors four to ten, is being treated as suspicious because it is the second the building has suffered this year. The previous fire, which occurred on February 18, was deemed by a multi-national investigation at the time to have been caused by an electrical fault. The minister has, however, promised that the fact both fires occurred on a Sunday will be part of the investigation.\nThis latest fire has destroyed the records of several private shipping companies, causing Farhatullah Babar of the Pakistan Peoples Party to declare that the fire was a deliberate act to destroy undesirable PNSC documents. However, Ghauri was dismissive of the allegations, saying \u201cBabar merely wants some cheap publicity and leveled allegations at us,\u201d and adding that PNSC records have not been affected by the fire. The records are computerised, and stored on the untouched first floor. The offices destroyed by the fire housed private corporations, such as Mega Shipping Company, Attock Cement, Engro, Meezan Bank and others.\nThere was already a known security issue in the building, with PNSC Chairman Tanvir Naqvi telling reporters \u201cWe were just about to issue tenders for improving security in the building when this happened.\u201d\nPeople described as 'sources in the PNSC' told reporters that the building was constructed by a company based in Turkey for Rs 30 million in 1958. \u201cThis building will not be demolished. Damages will be repaired and the building can be made usable,\u201d said one.\nOne man who worked on the fourth floor of the structure, who requested anonymity because he was not authorised to represent the PNSC, told the \"Daily Times\" newspaper that \u201cThe fire initially did not break out on the fourth floor,\" as originally reported, saying instead \u201cAt around 2:00 p.m. we saw smoke coming through our lighting fixtures. Within 36 seconds the smoke was so thick that we could not recognize people standing right in front of us. There is no air exhaust system on the emergency exits. If we had not evacuated immediately, we would have suffocated and died on the emergency exits.\u201d\nHe goes on to claim that of a number of PNSC employees present, not one knew how to operate the fire extinguishers supplied. They started panicking. I broke the glass and used the hose to try to put the fire out. But the smoke was too thick. We were in contact with Adeel (the worker on the roof of the building).\u201d\n\u201cThe fire started in the ducts of the building. The pillars had already been damaged by the February blaze.

Flynt eventually received his bachelor's degree from Sul Ross after attending another school where he earned the last 12 credit hours he needed. He transferred those hours back to Sul Ross. Flynt enrolled in graduate school so he can take advantage of his final semester of Division III eligibility.\nFlynt is giving new meaning to being a college senior. After all, he's a grandfather. He's eight years older than his coach and has two kids older than any of his teammates. His youngest child just started at the University of Tennessee.\nFlynt's position is still being determined, but he used to play linebacker. Wherever he lines up, just getting into a game likely will make him the oldest player in college football history. Neither the NCAA or NAIA keeps such a statistic, but research hasn't turned up anyone older than mid-40s.\nAnd with around 200 pounds (90 kg) on a 5-10 (178 cm) frame, about the only visible difference from his playing days is a shaved head. He's in tremendous shape for his age because he's made a living out of working out. Flynt, who declined an interview request, is paying his own tuition because Division III schools do not offer athletic scholarships."}

The new fossils say that the split may have happened as long as 10.5 million years ago.\n\"Based on this fossil, that means the split is much earlier than has been anticipated by the molecular evidence. That means everything has to be put back,\" said researcher at the Rift Valley Research Service in Ethiopia and a co-author of the study, Berhane Asfaw. \nDespite the finds, other researchers are not convinced that the findings are correct.\n\"It is stretching the evidence to base a time scale for the evolution of the great apes on this new fossil.

The third commercial flight company in New Zealand will start by focusing on New Zealand's three major cities, Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch.\nBudget airline, Pacific Blue Airlines, which is run by Virgin Blue, already runs flights in New Zealand to international destinations. And, despite only major cities currently being serviced, smaller cities and towns will be considered on November 15.\nThe service is set to start on November 15, with a special deal currently available of NZ$39 for all services per ticket for one way. This deal will be available until the latest of September 16. The normal online air fares range from $69 for Auckland to Wellington and Christchurch to Wellington. These fares are 22% cheaper than those offered by Air New Zealand. An air fare for Auckland to Christchurch is $10 more expensive at $79.\nVirgin Blue Chief Executive Officer, Brett Godfrey, said they expect to face a few hard years while the new services are starting. \"We expect actually to lose a little bit as we find our feet but our loss will be the travelling public's gain.\"\nSir Richard Branson, Chairman of the Virgin Group, said that he was \"absolutely delighted\" that Pacific Blue is set to enter the New Zealand domestic market, \"bringing its unmistakable fun, flair and affordability to travel within New Zealand.\" It was first rumoured that when Sir Branson was in New Zealand earlier this year that a domestic service was to begin, \"[Sir Richard Branson] promised that domestic services were something of interest to us under the right circumstances and at the right time.\"\nGodfrey describes the new services as a major investment and a long term commitment. \"The time is right to bring some much needed competition to the existing duopolistic market.\"\nDue to Pacific Blue starting a domestic service, New Zealand's flag carrier, Air New Zealand, has lost 8.6% on the share market in total this week. The day before Pacific Blue's announcement, Air New Zealand lost $179 million to due to share value drop. Head of research at Forsyth Barr, Rob Mercer, said, \"Air New Zealand has fallen $1 billion in value in the last couple of months, yet their earnings have got stronger.\"\nMercer says, \"Call me an optimist but competition can sometimes be a good thing. And if someone really puts in a product that stimulates the market and grows it, it can actually be a good thing, and Air New Zealand being the incumbent can actually be quite a beneficiary out of that environment.\"\nThe Chief Executive of the Travel Agents Association, Paul Yeo, describes New Zealand's current airfares as too high, due to lack of competition. Yeo now expects this to change with Air New Zealand and Qantas matching Pacific Blues prices.\nAir New Zealand did in fact drop its cheapest airfares to match those offered by Pacific Blue, effective September 1.\nFor the new flights, Pacific Blue is set to add two new Boeing 737-800 to their existing fleet of 53 Boeing 737s.\nAustralian aviation analyst Peter Harbison said Air New Zealand could come under further pressure on domestic routes with Singapore-based budget airline Tiger Airways expected to cross the Tasman by the middle of next year. Australian aviation analyst, Peter Harbison, expects Singaporean airline, Tiger Airways, to be operating in New Zealand by mid-2008."}

With the recorders at a depth of approximately 1,700 meters (1 mile), salvage operations could cost as much as US$6 million (\u20ac4.45 million).\nExperts have predicted that the recovery could be further complicated by strong currents in the area, which may have buried the recorders in sediment or else dislodged them from their original location. \nAccording to one crew member, the recovery vessel - the \"Eas\" - has a 16-member crew and carries a mini submarine, which can reach depths of 6,000 meters (20,000 feet), as well as being equipped with sonar and deep sea cameras.\nThe crash is one of three this year, which in combination have caused all Indonesian airlines to be added to the list of air carriers banned in the EU.

The wasps then attempt to mate with the flowers, before moving on, often to another orchid, thus pollinating them. The discovery received worldwide attention at the time.\n\"I wanted to know what it was about the five orchids that could persuade the male that they were all a female [wasp],\" she says, adding that the flowers all look very different to the human eye, and that usually only one species of insect pollinates one species of plant.\n\"I have accumulated the first compelling evidence of an ongoing and escalating arms race between orchids and their unwitting insect pollinators,\" Gaskett, says, \"Over generations the insects learn to avoid having sex with orchids, and this means only the most persuasive orchids reproduce, which drives the acceleration of orchid subterfuge.\"\nGaskett has discovered that the wasp, however, quickly learns to avoid the orchid, meaning that \"...only the most persuasive orchids will continue to reproduce,\" she says. She has also discovered that the flowers have various structures that feel like parts of a female wasp to a male, including mimic 'love handles', which the male would normally hold on to during mating. Gaskett says of this particular discovery that the flowers have \"curves in all the right places\".\nGasket has also used a spectrometer to analyse the colours of four of the orchids and a female wasp, and found that, although they look very different to humans, they actually match almost exactly.\nGasket's research is important to the conservation of the orchids, and to developing sensitive control methods for use against agricultural pests. She says of the wasps \"these insects might be fools for love, but their role as orchid pollinators makes them indispensable.\"\nGasket has currently turned her attentions to the role of scent in the process, and is testing the effect of the perfumes of the orchids on the antennae of the male wasps.\nSources.\n "}

Some of the gathered demonstrators, notably union leader Dave Coles, could be seen and heard telling the officers to leave, put down the rock, and remove their bandannas: several protesters then tried to remove the officer's bandannas. The undercover officers retreated behind police lines and could be seen being put to the ground and restrained by the riot police.\nThose at the protest said the officers were acting like agents provocateurs by provoking violence from within the crowd.

On Friday, August 24, at 1 p.m., while investigating another water infiltration incident, The Bay employees noticed that the ceiling of the tunnel portion of The Bay's basement sales area had descended one inch over a 7 meter length. They subsequently called police. The police and firefighters evacuated the basement of the downtown Bay store. The police closed de Maisonneuve Boulevard from Aylmer Street to Union Street, over the area of the crack.\nAt 4 p.m., firefighters evacuated the Parkade Montreal Building and The Bay Department Store after finding pieces of concrete falling from the Parkade Montreal structure, a multi-story carpark with five levels of offices on top.

After consulting with city engineers, Centre 2001, the loading dock of the Bay and its Hertz car rental agency, Les Promenades Cathedrale underground shopping centre and office tower, and a neighbouring office tower to the Parkade were also evacuated. Police cordoned off an area from Bleury Street in the east to University Street in the west, and from Ste-Catherine Street in the south to President Kennedy Street to the north.\nThe closure of the Metro caused havoc to the Friday afternoon rush hour, as over 40,000 people regularly use the Green Line (Line 1) every day. Montreal Transit Corporation workers issued directions during the day, though some may not have been informed of a provisionary bus service to replace the lost subway service. Loudspeakers announced that commuters should use the unaffected Orange Line (Line 2), which has lines between 5 and 10 blocks south of Line 1 (Green Line), and also connects to Lionel-Groulx and Berri-UQAM stations. \nThe downtown area is intended to remain closed for at least the weekend, along with portions of the underground city, or RESO. The tunnel was built in 1966.

The tunnel roof lies five meters below street level. \nResidents of Montreal are frustrated with the crumbling infrastructure in and around the city, including the collapse of the de la Concorde Boulevard overpass over Autoroute 19 expressway last year, the shattering of a column holding up the Autoroute 720 Ville Marie elevated expressway last month, and other incidents."}

In addition, the yield per hectare was up from last year, due to favourable weather conditions. In 2007, opium yields were 42.5 kg per hectare, while in 2006 yields were 37.0 kg/ha. Overall in 2007, Afghanistan produced 8,200 tons of opium, an amount 34 percent greater than in 2006.\nThis marks the sixth consecutive year that production has increased despite the United States' US$600 million counter-narcotics program in Afghanistan. When commenting on the report\u2019s overall findings, William B. Wood, the American ambassador to Afghanistan, said, \"I think it is safe to say that we should be looking for a new strategy, and I think that we are finding one.\" He refers to the possibility of such enhanced U.S. efforts including spraying poppy crops with herbicides.

Immediately following the announcement of the action, the Ministry commenced proceedings to gain a High Court injunction against the POA.

The phone is expected to be available by 2008.\nMost of the features are the same as the iPhone's. They include music, games, and many other features, even ones that the iPhone may not have. Ovi (in Finnish meaning \"Door\") will be the door for more than 2 million songs and games available for download on the new device. Users will be able to download wirelessly in their own home or anywhere there is access to a computer.\nBut this is not the first time Nokia has made an attempt like this to increase its revenue. In October of 2003 the company revealed the N-Gage, a game-playing cell phone, but was \"stocked-out\" due to poor sales. The N95 smartphone, which was released in the U.S. on April 7, 2007 (before the iPhone on June 29, 2007) includes WiFi, a GPS, a music player, and a 5 megapixel digital camera. The three other phones that were revealed at the event in London will be in-stock next quarter. The new N81 and the modified N95 smartphones were among the revealed at yesterday's event; the N81 is a new member to Nokia's smartphone family; the N95 has been modified by having more memory and a sleeker LCD screen.\nWhen Nokia was asked about the striking similarity between this and the iPhone, Nokia's Executive Vice President and General Manager of Multimedia, Anssi Vanjoki, said, \"If there is something good in the world then we copy with pride.\"\nNokia first demoed their iPhone rival August 29th. During their demo they omitted the fact that the demo was for the software to be in use, not the actual hardware."}

They are moved forward during final approach for landing to increase lift from the wing, allowing the plane to fly slower than it can when the aircraft is configured for cruise without entering a stall. The bolt in question is mounted to the main slat tracks, on which the slats slide back and forth. As they are extended for landing, they can cause the bolt to be pushed through the adjacent wing fuel tank, rupturing it in the way it is believed the China Airlines plane's tank was.\nThus far, the inspections have discovered four airliners in which the bolt was loose. These discoveries give the authorities cause to believe that loose wing slat track bolts may be more widespread than originally considered, and accordingly reduced the inspection deadline from 24 days to 10 days. After that, inspections must be made every 3,000 operational hours, an unchanged schedule from the original set out at the same time as the 24-day deadline.\nThe Emergency Airworthiness Directive that the inspections are laid out in is believed to affect a total of 2,287 aircraft sold by Boeing around the world, although the FAA only has the authority to make the inspections compulsory for the 783 aircraft currently being operated in the U.S.\nAlthough the FAA refused to release any details on which aircraft were found to have loose bolts, CNN and Agence France-Presse both reported that a fifth plane also exhibited the fault, belonging to Air Nippon and in operation in Japan. Although the fault was located elsewhere in the assembly, it is believed to have an identically high chance of causing a rupture to the fuel tank. All 22 other 737 NextGens in Japan have been checked, with no problems being identified.\nMeanwhile, Norwegian Air Shuttle demonstrated it's faith in the aircraft by placing a US$3.1bn (UK\u00a31.5bn) order for 42 Boeing 737-800 passenger jets with an option to buy 42 more, having already ordered 11 in May this year."}

The new developments are the result of an investigation into four to six alleged dog fights. Dog fighting is a breach of animal cruelty laws in Finland, and the case will be considered for prosecution in October. They are being investigated under suspicion of breaching the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act.\nChief Inspector Olli T\u00f6yr\u00e4s of the Keskusrikospoliisin told reporters, \"I would not like to speculate on the motives for the arranging of these dog fights. At least thus far there has been no evidence of illegal gambling on the outcome of fights. There also does not seem to be any large-scale organisation behind the incidents or connections with organised crime groupings. It would appear to be the pastime of a group of individuals.\" Despite this, the group is known to have links throughout Scandinavia, as well as possible links to Russia.\nHe added that about a dozen pit bulls from America were involved in the incidents.\nKey evidence includes video footage and testimony from veterinary surgeons, who were present when police raided several locations suspected to be involved. \"Statements by veterinary surgeons are a significant part of the investigation. They play the same role here as forensic pathologists would in a normal violent crime investigation,\" Inspector T\u00f6yr\u00e4s said.\nThe investigation was begun as a result of an investigation into dog fighting in the United Kingdom by the state-run British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC). A BBC journalist teamed up with a man with military experience to infiltrate a notorious dog fighting ring from Ulster, Ireland, known as The Farmer Boys. This uncovered links to a group involved in comparable activity in Finland. The documentary, which is part of the \"Panorama\" series, was broadcast in Finland yesterday by YLE.\nThe BBC had contacted Finland regarding it's discoveries in April. The BBC itself had begun it's investigation after Gerard Cavlan, a football player from Northern Ireland, was convicted on charges related to dog fighting.\nThe programme included graphic scenes of a dog fight in Finland, filmed using hidden cameras. The show's team also purchased a pit bull from a dealer in Finland with false documents showing it to be another breed (pit bulls are illegal in Britain) and successfully transported it back without detection via Germany and Ireland, taking a ferry into England from Northern Ireland.\nThe dog breeder is a member of SATHY, an organisation which describes itself as \"a Finnish club devoted to dog breeds not recognized by FCI related associations (such as the Finnish Kennel Club, and some others). [The] Most important breeds for us are the American Bulldog, American Pit Bull Terrier, Toy Fox Terrier, American Hairless Terrier and Olde English Bulldog.\"\nSATHY has issued a statement via their website to the affect that they felt the programme was misleading, and that Finnish dog breeders have initiated legal proceedings against the British journalist responsible for the programme. One of the dog breeders shown during the programme denied any criminal activity when approached by the Finnish \"Helsingin Sanomat\" news service. \nPrivacy laws in Finland required the faces of those believed to be involved to be pixelated during the Finnish version of the broadcast, although this was not mirrored in the UK screening - which, in an unprecedented move, coincided exactly with the showing in Finland. The show was widely discussed on the internet, with large volumes of material requiring deleted by site administrators as breaching Finnish privacy legislation.\nThe investigation is the only one ever conducted into dog fighting in Finland. T\u00f6yr\u00e4s explained the problem to journalists: \u201dWe have only had vague unconnected hints of this sort of activity in the past, and on the basis of these it was not possible to mount an earlier investigation.\"\nSources.\n "}

Now it's filled with so many mosquitos that it's turned a little brown. There are times you can literally hear the screech of millions of mosquitoes caught in those webs.\"\nMike Quinn, an invertebrate biologist with the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department, described a high level of interest in the web: \"I've been hearing from entomologists [sic] from Ohio, Kansas, British Columbia, all over the place.\" It was Quinn who originally posted images of the web on the internet, sparking the intense interest.\nThere is much debate amongst experts over the reasons for the web's construction, with some believing it was created by social spiders living as a colony, and others suggesting it is possibly a system of mass dispersal, with the spiders building webs in order to spread out. There is also uncertainty over the species of spider responsible, although it is known that smaller webs of an otherwise similar nature have been discovered elsewhere in the park, on another trail. It is thought that the species is likely a member of the genus \"Tetragnatha\".\nJohn Jackman, a professor and extension entomologist for Texas A&amp;M University and author of \"A Field Guide to the Spiders and Scorpions of Texas\", said that the phenomenon is not particularly unusual and that reports are submitted to him every few years detailing similar webs. \"There are a lot of folks that don't realize spiders do that,\" Jackman said. \"Until we get some samples sent to us, we really won't know what species of spider we're talking about.\"\nHowever, other experts disagree over the unusual nature of the discovery. \"From what I'm hearing, it could be a once-in-a-lifetime event,\" said Herbert \"Joe\" Pase, a Texas Forest Service entomologist. \"It's very, very unusual.\"\nThe web is expected to begin to disintegrate soon, as the spiders die out over Autumn. \"It would make a good Halloween set, wouldn't it?\" said park ranger Freddie Gowin, who found the giant web while mowing last month.

This alleged scenario would allow Gordon Brown to announce a troop withdrawal in a statement at the time MPs return to Parliament.\nThe speculations have sparked criticism from U.S. military commentators this weekend. General Jack Keane said the withdrawal had \"much more to do with conditions in the U.K.\" than with the situation in Iraq. Frederick Kagan, of the American Enterprise Institute, said the expected withdrawal \"highlights the growing divergence between the British and American approach.\"\nJust yesterday, former General Sir Mike Jackson called Donald Rumsfeld's approach to the U.S. presence in Iraq \"intellectually bankrupt\".\nAn official statement from the British Ministry of Defence said that decisions about the number of troops in the Southern Iraqi province would take into account the position of the Iraqi and U.S. government. The Ministry said that even after \"a competent Iraqi security force\" will have replaced them, some troops could still remain in Basra. Until now, Gordon Brown has consistently refused to set a time table for a pull-back."}

It is the largest in Canada and the fifth largest in North America.\nThe three day Canadian International Airshow, the horse show called \"Tom Bishop's Trick Riding Show\", and many other events were the main attractions at this year's CNE. An estimated 1.3 million people attend the CNE every year.\nThe 680 News tower made entirely from Lego's was on display, with a fence around it.\nOn Saturday at 1:00 p.m. was the airshow, which featured award winning aviators, including the Canadian Forces (CF) snowbirds, flying planes used in Afghanistan. The United States Air Force (USAF) also flew planes used in the military and a new F-22 Raptor fighter aircraft for its first time in an international show. A CF-18 Hornet, Canadian version of the USAF F/A-18 Hornet, 1943 Boeing Stock Stearman PT-17, and many other rare planes were also flown. Everyone could see the airshow but for a good photo and video opportunity freelance Wikinews journalist and others paid CA$5.00 to get on top of Ontario Place, across from the exhibition grounds. There was a ton of stairs to get to the top, but it was well worth it if one wanted excellent photos and video to watch with their family.\n\"I used to come to the air show every year with my dad ... being out there flying over Lake Ontario in my hometown is unbelievable,\" said Capt. Yanick \"Crank\" Gregoire of the CF-18 Hornet, on its 25th anniversary.\nGeneral Rick Hillier, Chief of the Defence Staff of the Canadian Forces, made a brief speech and talked about Canada's mission in Afghanistan. Followed by was a pre-recorded speech made by Prime Minister Stephen Harper. Then the American and Canadian national anthems were played and the show begun, it even included a live pilot in a Canadian Forces plane talking through his microphone into the speakers on top of Ontario Place. The airshow was something not to be missed as the staggering planes are always best watched live.\nIn the Direct Energy Centre at Exhibition Place were many vendors and people selling books, cloths, inventions, and even some live cooking shows. There was also a arts, crafts, and hobbies building, which was one of the best places to visit at this year's CNE. Rides and attractions filled the grounds across Ontario Place.\nThe famous Iams-sponsored Superdogs performed dog tricks for an audience in a large area, while behind the curtains were salespeople at booths advertising and selling Iams dog food. They perform at the Royal Winter Fair in Toronto and other fairs in Canada.\nAt 5:00pm was the horse show at the Riding Academy \"Horse Palace\", hosted by Tom Bishop Sr. There was a woman representing Ontario, a 15-year-old girl from Alberta representing Canada, and a man from the United States on a black horse. One of the horse riders, a champion, was from Canada but moved to the U.S. and has toured both countries. Tom Bishop Jr. stood and rode on top of two \"Canadians\", the most rare and oldest horse breed in North America. The horses had to jump over a line of gas-led fire, Tom Bishop Sr. noted beforehand that horses are scared of fire.\nAt 9:00 p.m. was the Human Cannon Ball, from the U.S. Performed by David \"The Bullet\" Smith, Jr., son of Cannonball Smith, is the second person in the world that can do the \"don't-do-this-at-home-or-else!\" stunt. It is their third year at the CNE. Most people came 20 minutes before to get a good spot. The shot was so loud that some had to plug their ears, and if one didn't their heart would be beating hard. Smith jumped out like he's done that stunt a thousand times, he did a push up on the ground and quickly ran back.\nWhile walking to the Ontario Place parking lot, as soon as the \"Human Cannon Ball\" was finished, the Canadian Forces had several of their vehicles used in Afghanistan on display outside. A snowbirds plane, some LAV III's, tanks, a helicopter, and a boat were on display. Soldiers were outside to greet and talk to the visitors, and had photos taken. A large banner was hung and old music was playing. People even signed a board beside a tank showing their support and thanks to the soldiers currently deployed. There was also a large tent with real Canadian soldiers giving away bracelets and showing actual uniforms used. They were very heavy and one soldier actually said the cloths are comfortable. It wasn't clear which base the soldiers came from but one said that he came from Halifax, Nova Scotia.\nThe CNE closes every night at 11:00pm.\nIt ends on Labour Day at 7:00pm."}

The west side is higher and that's where the tadpoles hibernate until winter. After that, they mature and go back to their old location to breed.\nAccording to the \"Canadian Press\", the recent young toads also escaped from the local wetlands into the highway instead of using the fence that guides them. An interesting fact is that when the toads come back in the winter they do not use the highway, they cross at streams and rivers instead.\nThe Ministry of Transportation has now put buckets beside a fence along the highway so the toadlets jump into the buckets and local volunteers and conservation groups bring them across the road into the Millar Creek area.\nBut this is a regular practice for the toads. It has been happening for several weeks now. According to environmental technician Kate Paul, 25,000 toadlets per day have been rescued from becoming roadkill.\n\"We've been walking the fence and collecting the little guys that end up in the pails. Once we've made a full sweep of the fence, we'll then take them across the highway and let them go,\" said Paul.\n\"Right now we're estimating we've transported about a million toadlets across the highway to the other side,\" said Paul. \"The numbers are starting to decrease a little bit now, so there's a chance this migration may be over within the week.\"\nPaul noted since in some parts of the U.S. toads are considered an endangered species, they are doing their \"best to increase their survival rates\" and they do their \"best to help them out.\"\n\"It seems the population has just spiked, and there are thousands and thousands and thousands of them and they still seem to prefer the road than to the culverts,\" said Sue Pauwels, area manager with the Ministry of Transportation.\nThe toadlets were described as brownish green or black and were camouflaged."}

Now, the prosecutor has finished the inquiry. The accounts against Scientology and some of its members include blackmailing, swindling of its members, breaking trade and privacy laws, unlawfully practicing medicine, and forming a criminal organisation.\nIf it comes to a trial, it would be the first time the movement is prosecuted on this scale. In some countries Scientology is recognised as an official religion, and Scientology has celebrities such as Tom Cruise and John Travolta as followers.\nMembers follow expensive trainings for their spiritual development, but some accuse Scientology of manipulation and brainwashing. The Church has come under controversy before with a wide variety of accusations, including a variety of criminal charges such as in 1978 when prominent members were caught engaging in wiretapping, and stealing documents from United States Internal Revenue Service. Yesterday, the European bureau could not give a reaction to the Belgian press. In the past however, the movement has repeatedly denied allegations against it."}

Craig Venter Institute and the University of Rochester. This is the first example of large-scale horizontal gene transfer between single-celled and multicellular organisms. Although horizontal gene transmission is common among single-celled organisms, it is rare among multicellular organisms, and large scale transfer like that of an entire genome had previously not been suspected. \nThe scientists found that in addition to Wolbachia engaging in almost complete genome transfer into Drosophila ananassae, it also had made significant transfer in 3 other insects species and 4 species of nematodes. The researchers found candidate species by scanning genetic databases for sequences found in Wolbachia. The scientists also found that these added sections were conserved by reproduction; that is the added sections stayed in the genomes after multiple generations. Moreover, there is evidence that suggests that the segments of Wolbachia's genome increased the reproductive fitness of the insect species. \nThe transfers likely occurred during attempts at DNA repair in which the repair mechanisms incorporated Wolbachia DNA (available since the cells were infected with Wolbachia) into the genomes. These results could have major implications for understanding of evolution. The research also has implications for various forms of sequencing research, since when sequencing species, bacteria sequences are frequently ignored as they are generally assumed to be contaminants rather than good data. \nWolbachia, a genus of bacteria that normally infects arthropods, especially insects, is already known for its odd behavior that can affect species in strange ways. For example, Wolbachia has been shown to be correlated with fast evolution among species it infects and is suspected for being responsible for a variety of speciation events as a side effect of Wolbachia creating reproductive barriers. Wolbachia by some estimates infects more than half of all arthropods and is already thought to play a major role in the evolution and speciation of many invertebrates. \nSince Wolbachia can generally only reproduce through females, it has adopted a number of strategies that treat males and females of species differently that can result in reproductive barriers. These strategies include killing of males, forced parthenogenesis, and preventing infected males from reproducing with uninfected females."}

Joe Stewart is the Unit Manager of the Department of Internal Affairs new Anti-Spam Compliance Unit, and David Farrar is Chair of InternetNZ\u2019s Public Policy Committee, who also had significant input into the final bill.\nKeith Norris, CEO of the New Zealand Marketing Association, didn't respond to multiple requests for an interview. \nThe anti-spam legislation, or the Unsolicited Electronic Messages Act 2007, promotes spam education and awareness and will enable international agencies to work together to share information and will enable cross-border pursuit of serious law breakers. And it doesn't just cover e-mail spam, but all electronic messaging such as SMS/text messaging, etc.\nHowever, New Zealand isn't the most up-to-date country with implementing similar legislation, Farrar says, \u201cWe are in fact almost the last country in the OECD to have such legislation.\u201d He urges Eastern Europe and China to take part in the fight against spam.\nStewart said that the new law would only help combat a small amount of spam, as 99%-99.9% of all spam received originates from overseas. He says the legislation alone will not solve the problem.\nAs well as it helping to fight New Zealand-sourced spam and preventing New Zealand from \u201cbecoming a haven for spammers\u201d, it will promote good practices within the e-marketing community, Stewart said.\nThe new Act will affect legitimate marketers in New Zealand by making sure they have expressed or inferred consent to continue sending marketing messages to people on their database. Inferred consent is where the marketers have the e-mail address and send messages to those on their database, but didn't get expressed consent to send messages. Stewart does issue a warning against using inferred consent saying, \u201cThey may have been sending these people messages for years, but this does not establish consent.\u201d\nA surge in emails has also been felt with companies/marketers making sure they have consent to continue the e-mails and asking those to confirm they wish to continue their subscription.\n\u201cHowever, many marketers are already fulfilling these requirements because they are standard good e-marketing practice,\u201d Stewart said.\nDue to legislative requirements, as well as having consent, businesses will have to provide details about the company sending the item, and provide a free way to unsubscribe from future mailings.\nThose found breaking these requirements deliberately could find themselves facing a personal fine of up to NZ$200,000. Organisations could face a fine of up to $500,000. Farrar said, \u201cExperience from Australia shows most cases are dealt with by way of education.\u201d\nFarrar also gives a final piece of advice to those annoyed with spam levels, \u201cNever ever respond to a spam e-mail, and only give your real address out to people you trust.\u201d"}

More than 300 Proton rockets have been launched, all from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan. Following the launch failure, Kazakhstan suspended the launch of Proton rockets from Baikonur, Interfax news agency reported.\nJSAT Corporation immediately placed an order with Lockheed Martin, the satellite manufacturer, for an identical replacement satellite based on the A2100AX design.\nFailure investigation.\nA Russian State Commission will be responsible for determining the cause of the failure. In addition, a Failure Review Oversight Board will review the commission's final report and corrective action plan in accord with U.S. and Russian government export control regulations, International Launch Services, the launch service provider, said.\nEnvironmental concern.\nThe propellants used by the rocket are highly toxic. Possible environmental contamination at the crash site is a particular concern, an insurance company spokesman said. The rocket came down in the central Kazakh steppe, 50 kilometers (30 miles) southeast of the town of Dzhezkazgan, and a team has been sent there to determine the extent of any pollution."}

On August 10th, Pavarotti, 71, was admitted to Modena University Polyclinic in Modena, Italy with a high fever. The cause of the fever was unknown, though some reports stated that he was being treated for pneumonia.\n\"The Maestro fought a long, tough battle against the pancreatic cancer which eventually took his life. In fitting with the approach that characterized his life and work, he remained positive until finally succumbing to the last stages of his illness,\" said Terri Robson, Pavarotti's manager in a statement to the press.\nPavarotti had been diagnosed with pancreatic cancer last year, and in July of 2006 he underwent surgery to remove a cancerous mass. According to Nicoletta Mantovani, Pavarotti's wife, he had also been receiving radiation treatments.\nPavarotti's death came only one day after becoming the first recipient of the new \"Excellence in Italian Culture Award\" from the Italian government, the Italian Culture Ministry reported on Tuesday evening. The tenor received the award for promoting Italian culture abroad and within Italy itself. The opera house where he performed for the first time 40 years ago, La Scala opera house in Milan, stated it will organize a singing contest in honor of the Italian tenor. "}

This short course Triathlon starts in the canal in Sluis, the Netherlands, where the athletes swim 1000 metres. Then the 41 kilometres cycling part of the race goes through the nature domain Het Zwin, to the city of Knokke in Belgium, where the athletes had 10 kilometres of running on the seawall ahead of them. The finish was at the casino in Knokke.\nIn the Men's race, Stijn Goris surprisingly beat living legend Luc Van Lierde and Rutger Beke, known for being acquitted from allegations that he had used EPO. Goris, the leader in the overall ranking in the Olympic distance, could just follow Luc Van Lierde during the swimming part. He completed the cycling race together with Van Lierde, but had better legs during the footrace. Number four was Bart Aernouts, a duathlete champion who increasingly focuses on triathlon. Young talents Marc Geerts and Lander Dirken followed, before Frederik Van Lierde and Koen Hoeyberghs, who won the competition in the age group of 40 years and older (40+).\nKristien Vleugels was the first female athlete, before Knokke's local favourite and category 40+ athlete Fran\u00e7oise Wellekens. Another favourite, Joke Coysman, stopped her race after fainting during the running section. Sofie Goos followed, while Marjolein Truyers managed to keep her advantage before Inge Vancauwenberghe and Anne-Marie Dupont. The winners from each race took home \u20ac2500.\nAlmost 1000 athletes came to Knokke for the triathlon, professional and recreational, men and woman, and also hand-bike athletes. A typical element of this triathlon is the fact that some competitors finish the race in a costume. Among these, \"Spiderman\" was the first to cross the finish line. Other characters came from the Belgian comic albums of Tintin, from the fairy tale Peter Pan, there was a Roman soldier, a Tarzan look-a-like, a Chiquita Banana, and more."}

The eight Russian jets were flying in airspace patrolled by Nato, officials from the UK claimed. The long-range bombers were initially followed by Norwegian F16 jets, after Russia's recent decision to reinstate Cold War-style long-range patrols. \n14 strategic bombers were flying on long-range patrol, according to Russia's Defence Ministry. They also confirmed that none had approached a foreign state and had been shadowed by aircraft from Nato countries. \nThe Ministry of Defence in the United Kingdom released a statement that the Russian Tupolev Tu-95 Bear aircraft, flying in four loosed pairs, were tracked by Norwegian aircraft before entering Nato airspace on Thursday morning. The UK currently holds responsibility for the Nato airspace, and launched four F3 Tornados from RAF Leeming in North Yorkshire, UK, to identify the bombers. The bombers eventually left the Nato zone, under tracking by UK aircraft and RAF radar in Northumberland. \nAn MoD spokesman confirmed that Russia was entitled to its long-range patrols, adding 'The motivation behind any Russian military activity is a matter for the Russian government.' Lt Col John Inge Oegland, spokesman for the Norwegian armed forces, said there had been several similar incidents in recent months, but that the Russian flights were not causing alarm in Norway. \nRelations between Britain and Russia have worsened recently, particularly after Russia's refusal to allow the extradition of a former KGB bodyguard suspected of murdering emigre Alexander Litvinenko in London last year. Relations with Russia would \"continue as normal outside the unresolved extradition request\", a UK Foreign Office spokesman said."}

Broken windows and walls were found ripped open.\nThe terms \"Kike\", \"Fuck Jews,\" and \"White Power\" were written in white around the house, as well as a large green swastika.\nThe woman's husband Mr. Allan Schwarz, was returning home to their house on King Street East, the town's center, to bring home a present for their 40th wedding anniversary when he found the house not the way he left it. \nBought to start an antique store, the Schwarz's started a cattle business instead and later rented it out. Ten years ago their tenant started to rent the house, just five months ago he stopped paying rent saying he was on welfare. Ms. Schwarz offered to lower his rent. He vandalized and fled, with his son and daughter, from the house on Tuesday morning, the day he was to be evicted.

The facility had been designed to house 300 boys. Surrounding the existing school buildings was a barbed wire fence. It was not the typical POW camp, having good food and prisoners being well treated. It had gardens and even a swimming pool was built. Movies were shown each week, music concerts were held, and stage plays were produced.\nMr. Schwarz fled from Germany to Canada in 1938. Marion, a Toronto native, and her husband moved to Bowmanville to start a new life.\n\"In 1938, we found safe haven in Bowmanville,\" said her son Alan. \"It was wonderful place to settle and my parents have been here basically for 70 years.

The tool allows users to search for some edits to several editions of the online free-content encyclopedia Wikipedia made from Internet addresses assigned to particular companies.\nThe media buzz made Virgil's tool near-inaccessible as it was swamped with queries. Initially broken by Wired, the articles highlighted edits from network addresses assigned to Diebold and the CIA, and encouraged readers to reveal and share their findings. Mainstream media such as the BBC revealed that edits made from CIA addresses had made changes to the article on Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, and that edits were made from Vatican addresses to Gerry Adams's article.\nReaders of the BBC news website were quick to point out that edits to Wikipedia also originated from the BBC network addresses. Peter Clifton, head of BBC Interactive, confessed to writing about himself and revealed that a prankster within the BBC had edited George W. Bush's entry to state that his middle name was \"Wanker\". The BBC's Internet address range had a total of nearly 8,000 edits to other various English Wikipedia articles such as Janet Jackson, Super Furry Animals and Freeview.\nWithout confirmation such as Peter Clifton gave, it is usually impossible to determine from the IP address alone if the edits made from it were even performed by an employee of the organization. While it is likely that the majority of edits are from an organisation's employees there is the possibility that visitors could be using a company address, or a public-wifi could be on offer. All of this would appear to be edits from the company according to Wikiscanner, and even when the edits do come from employees or representatives, there is no way to tell from the data alone whether the company endorses the edits, or even knows about them.\nWhile Wikipedia advertises itself as the encyclopaedia \"anyone can edit\", there are guidelines on the site directing how users may edit the articles\u2014and even, in some cases, who shouldn't be editing them. None of Wikipedia's \"conflict of interest\" policies attempt to limit what people can edit based on the Internet address that they are using.\n\"Wikinews\" had already started an investigation into just what edits the tool revealed. Hampered by the difficulty getting results due to the traffic load on the web server, we began checking company names and names of media groups. In addition to verifying that the vast majority of edits from network addresses assigned to the BBC were beneficial to the Wikipedia project, the others, CNN, MSNBC, Reuters and AP received a fairly clean bill of health. People using Reuters' Internet connectivity appeared the first to discover Wikipedia, editing as early as February 2002. Users from AP had made a few edits to articles about the AP, none of which could be considered negative contributions, other contributions included additions to several The Simpsons episodes. However, edits originating at address space assigned to FOX News, and its parent company, News Corporation were more frequently unproductive, many which under Wikipedia and most other Wikimedia project policy, would be considered vandalism and would usually result in a block or ban of editing Wikimedia projects.\nThe edits from FOX's address space, now totalling almost 700, start with an edit to the article on FOX which deleted links to websites critical of FOX. Some of the edits could be characterized as an attempt conceal criticism voiced in the documentary Outfoxed: Rupert Murdoch's War on Journalism which alleges bias by FOX News. This was replaced with a link to the company's official response and another to a story put out by FOX News questioning the validity of the film's sources. The same Internet address at FOX News then removed criticism from the article on Alan Colmes.\nOther addresses within FOX also edited articles on FOX News employees such as Brit Hume, Shepard Smith and Chris Wallace inserting positive information, highlighting their ratings successes and slogan, \"fair and balanced\" before going on to describe the New York Times as \"left wing\" and blanking the quotes section on the article about their columnist Mike Straka. The current version of this article is disputed on neutrality grounds as the entire biography and criticism sections have been removed. Including comments about anti-war protesters - \"\"whom he has denounced as \"smelly\", \"stupid\", \"stinking\", \"jobless\", \"anti-American\" and \"traitors\".\"\"\nMore recent edits include downplaying Sean Hannity's importance to the show Hannity and Colmes by removing the fact that he is the shows executive producer and referring to him as simply \"host\" or \"co-host\". Details of Wendy Murdoch's previous marriage to the husband from the couple who sponsored her trip to study in the United States were excised by another Fox News address. \nInvestigation of a wider field of media organisations revealed that the News Corporation subsidiary British Sky Broadcasting has the same history of juvenile and prank edits with insults posted against staff on their payroll as well as UK celebrities. The main proxy server that allows their staff on the Internet currently has a large warning of who the IP address belongs to and a list of block messages and block/edit warnings. Some of the vandalism committed through their proxy has been described as \"racist\" and \"potentially libelous\".\nWikiScanner cannot identify the origin of any edit made by a registered user. Users are not required to register an account to edit Wikipedia, and those who do not register have their edits associated with an IP address. Edits from unregistered users are, inaccurately, called \"anonymous\" edits.\nWikimedia's privacy policy does not allow revealing the IP address of registered users except as dictated by Wikimedia's . Users of Wikiscanner cannot find out about editing by registered users, even if they are coming from the same IP address as the \"anonymous\" users who did not register. \nVirgil's conditions for speaking to the media include the format of a link to his website. His goal, to get a Google search for \"Virgil\" to return his page as the top listing. As of publication he's succeeded."}

It is believed that the motorcade was waved through security checkpoints on Macquarie Street and ended up just metres from the hotel where United States President George W. Bush was staying. Police moved in on the group when one of the pranksters emerged from a vehicle dressed as Osama bin Laden.\nPolice commissioner Andrew Scipione said the prank could have resulted in someone being injured. \"The reality is...

Assembly Bill 821 bans the use of lead bullets for hunting within California. The bill, which was sponsored by Assemblyman Pete Nava and has letters of support from a number of conservation and environmental groups, was passed by a majority of 23 to 15.\nBill proponents argued that an important reason to support the ban rests in the threat lead bullets pose to endangered species such as the California condor.\n\"I am elated that the fight to save the condor, North America\u2019s largest bird, is one step closer to reality,\" stated Nava. \n\"The California Condor is a national treasure and with the recent death of a California condor at the Los Angeles Zoo last week from lead poisoning, further highlights the urgent need for my legislation so that our children and grandchildren can know and see these magnificent birds in the wild,\" added Nava.\nBill opponents, primarily groups that support hunting and the right to bear arms, argued that lead bullets were not a significant source of the threat to California condors. A statement posted on the web site of the National Rifle Association states, \"the most recent scientific review provided to the Commission revealed that previous science attempting to show a link between lead ammunition and condor mortality is severely flawed.\"\nScientists at the Zoological Society of San Diego, an organization that has worked to reproduce condors and place them back in the wild since the 1980's state that there is strong evidence to support the effect of lead bullets on California condor populations. \n\"All of the California condors which die in the wild are brought to us to determine the cause of death,\" stated Allison Alberts, Director of Conservation and Research for the Zoological Society of San Diego. \n\"Of these condors, 24% have died of lead poisoning. Studies indicate that this lead is coming from bullet fragments and shot that have been ingested when eating carcasses,\" added Alberts.\nAn article published by Bird Conservation International cites the ingestion of trash picked up from the environment as another serious threat to condor populations. This study indicates the threat is primarily for juvenile condors in the nest however."}

Several protesters claimed that Sydney had been turned into a \"police state\" as a result of the security measures. Commissioner Scipione said \"all allegations of police misconduct would be investigated\".\nA second protest, held in Belmore Park attracted around 1,000 people from Vietnamese and Tibetian backgrounds protested against Chinese President Hu Jinato's human rights record.

Two large concrete sections dropped onto oncoming cars and motorised rickshaws, damaging several severely.\nA large emergency effort was immediately activated, but experienced severe difficulties in reaching the site due to congested traffic resulting from the collapse. Ambulances from the 108 EMRI Service and Appollo Hospitals attended the scene, and rushed the injured to a variety of nearby hospitals. All the region's major hospitals, particularly the nearby Nizam Institute of Medical Sciences, have placed their medical staff on emergency alert. Rescuers are now using cranes and cutting equipment in an effort to reach anyone who may still be trapped. It is expected that the death toll could rise further as many vehicles remain trapped under tons of debris.\nVarious politicians also attended the scene, including the local district collector, Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh Dr. YS Rajasekhara Reddy, Senior Congress Leader and MLA from Khairathabad P Janardhan Reddy and several other ministers.\nPolice have asked both the public and the press to keep away from the area, in order to prevent further collapse of the unstable structure. Preliminary investigations suggest the flyover had been been poorly constructed. The construction project had been carried out by leading contractor Gammon India Limited. It had been delayed, the original foundations having been built in 2005. After a successful request by the company to have the deadline for the project extended, work was slated to cease in November of this year, with the flyover entering operation by December. It is believed heavy rains in the area a few hours prior to the collapse may have contributed to the disaster."}

Hamilton's position was not as stable, however, when Felipe Massa overtook him on the start, but the Londoner took back his position on the first chicane.\nAfter ten laps Massa drove his car to the pits, possibly too soon, then suddenly slowed down on the track. It became clear that the race was spoiled for Ferrari team, with only the red car of Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen, doing his best not to fall too far behind Hamilton, remaining in the race. His risky single pit-stop strategy allowed him to stay ahead of Hamilton for a couple of laps, but the fresh tyres of McLaren after their second pit-stop left no additional chances to Raikonnen who suffered a crash into the wall of tyres in the Friday practice session.\nBoth BMW Saubers of Nick Heidfeld and Robert Kubica took 4th and 5th places.\nTop eight closed by Nico Rosberg's Williams-Toyota, Heikki Kovalainen's Renault and Jenson Button's Honda.\nAs a result, McLaren strengthen the lead over Ferrari to 23 points, with 166 points total.

The Coalition also asks why none of his plays mention his home town of Stratford-upon-Avon, and also how a 16th Century commoner could have such extensive and accurate knowledge of the worldwide settings in which they take place.\nConspiracy theories since the 18th century have claimed that the works could have been written by authors using the pen name Shakespeare, particularly Francis Bacon, Christopher Marlowe and Edward de Vere. Sir Derek Jacobi, actor and member of the Shakespeare Authorship Coalition, believes that the famous plays could have been written by more than one writer. \"I subscribe to the group theory,\" Sir Derek said. \"I don't think anybody could do it on their own.\" \nA \"declaration of reasonable doubt\" was presented to Dr William Leahy, Head of English at London's Brunel University.

Mills High School. Doninger had won the Class Secretary position at the high school. Earlier Doninger had posted derogatory comments on her blog about school officials and the school administration did not allow her to take the position as Class Secretary. Doninger alleges that the school's actions violated her First Amendment right to free speech. \nAlso at issue is whether Doninger's use of the school's email system for an earlier mass email played a part in the school's decision. The school claims that the email led to serious disruption while Doninger claims that the email was only cited retroactively.\nKravitz ruled that there was not a substantial likelihood that Doninger would win her case against the school and thus declined to grant the injunction. Kravitz stated that although Doninger did not write the blog entry while on-campus, \"Avery's blog entry may be considered on-campus speech for the purposes of the First Amendment.\" Kravits reasoned that the blogs' arguable on-campus nature together with Supreme Courts precedents that students have more limited free speech rights while on campus combined to give Doninger a weak case. \nThe ruling has been criticized, with some observers arguing that by Kravitz's logic, almost any online speech by students can be severely restricted by school administrators. This ruling is a setback to Doninger, although she and her family stated that they intend to appeal the injunction and also continue with their lawsuit.\nDoninger's case gained national attention earlier after Doninger set up a website to appeal for donations to help with legal fees associated with the cause. The exact limits of students free speech rights in public schools has been a matter of controversy since 1969 when in Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District the United States Supreme Court ruled that students have some free speech rights in schools. In later cases, such as Bethel School District v. Fraser, and Morse v. Frederick, colloquially known as the \"Bong Hits 4 Jesus\" case, the Supreme Court ruled that students in public schools while engaging in actions on campus or otherwise affiliated with the school do not enjoy the complete First Amendment protections that would normally apply to citizens in other circumstances.

It's to put into place the laws that Parliament has passed, so I hope they will reconsider this decision,\" Harper said in Australia after the APEC summit officially ended. \"But in the meantime, if that doesn't happen, Parliament will have to consider what actions it's going to take to make sure its intentions are put into place...We just adopted this past sitting in the spring, Bill C-31, a law designed to have the visual identification of voters. It's the purpose of the law \u2026 and I think this decision goes in an entirely different direction.\"\nBy disallowing the wearing of veils Elections Canada can determine if a voter is voting twice on the same day. But about eighty-thousand Canadians voted by mail during the 2006 general election, which makes the problem seem even more complex.\n\"It's primarily because no (Muslim) groups came forward requesting special treatment,\" said NDP leader Jack Layton.\n\"We would ask Elections Canada to reconsider its decision, and to require veiled women to unveil their faces to confirm their identities,\" Liberal leader Stephane Dion said in a statement on September 7.\nThe Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois proposed a bill asking people with veils to take them off on when they vote in federal elections, as well as Quebec premier Jean Charest, who made his complaints public on September 7 . They wrote a letter to Elections Quebec asking that Muslim voters be required to unveil in three upcoming by-elections next Monday. The decision ended allowing Muslims to wear their veils. \"In the case of a niqab or burka during the federal byelection that'll take place Sept. 17, the [chief electoral officer] has made the identification of electors impossible,\" said lawmaker Michel Guimond.\n\"We designed the bill to improve the possibility of identification of the voters...It's not a question of numbers. When you go to a polling station, you must show your face,\" Guimond said at a press conference in Ottawa earlier on Monday, before the final decision was made.\nIf Muslims don't want to unveil and if they don't have ID with them they can just make an oath verifying their identity and provide an address before voting, says Marc Mayrand, Chief Electoral Officer with Elections Canada. Elections Canada volunteers at the voting stations can also ask for the unveiling of a voter. Or another person, who lives in the same riding, can verify their identity. If the voter only brings one piece of information then they may be asked to unveil (but are not required), although a picture (or unveiling) is not required if two ID's are presented. However, voters are always asked to use the election cards that were mailed to them. It is the safest and most effective way to vote.\n\"The prime minister has indicated that he feels I may have misinterpreted the act,\" Mayrand said. \"I can only presume it's because it's been raised so actively in the media . . . probably people did not pay enough attention (before).\"\n\"If it's not clear to the chief electoral officer, then as of this afternoon we'll make it clear,\" Minister of Transport, Lawrence Cannon, said.\nBut Sarah Elgazzar, a spokeswoman for the Canada Council on American-Islamic Relations, says that Muslims aren't afraid of unveiling: \"If anybody had actually bothered to ask the women that are actually concerned, and we are talking about a very small minority of women, they would have told them that they always take it off to identify their faces,\" she said. \"And they do it at the bank, they do it at border crossings, they do it at the airport.\"\nThe Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms states:\nElections Quebec, in charge of voting in the province of Quebec, during the provincial elections in March, were forced by all three provincial party leaders to disallow the wearing of veils. There were many protests among the Muslim community and a few organisations.\nCurrently in Canada if a person does not have a voting card on election day they need, at least, two pieces of ID, and one must have their address, neither is required to have a photo. Just last year an American residing at a Toronto university voted at a polling station with ID and a bill showing his name and address. Elections Canada volunteers approved it, without knowing. It was later found out that he spoiled his ballot, meaning he drew over the circle.\n\"I invite Parliament to review, and if it wishes to do so, amend the provisions governing the conduct of the vote in light of the many comments voiced by politicians and the public,\" Mayrand said.\nLayton and Dion both say that they accept the decision made by Mayrand. Guimond and the Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois continue to disagree with the decision saying they will \"strike back\" with another bill."}

Darrow then posted the video on the internet on places like YouTube.com.\nIn the beginning of the nearly 13 minute video, the police officer states that Darrow was being pulled over because his vehicle \"seemed suspicious.\" Officer Kuehnlein claims that high crime rates in the lot caused Darrow to be pulled over.\nKuehnlein then asks Darrow to step out of the car and asks to see his ID.

Vice President Solomon Berewa of the Sierra Leone People's Party (SLPP) had garnered 36 percent support, according to the country's election commission.\nHowever, only 18 percent of the polls had been tallied so far and the election commission pointed out that the early poll results came mainly from an area in western Sierra Leone having strong support for APC. It could take up to 12 days to count all the votes. For the results that have been tabulated, voter turnout has been determined to be approximately 73 percent.\nThe lead-up to the run-off election had been marred by reports of violence and, on election day, monitors had observed some irregularities such as ballot box stuffing and excessive voter registrations. However, most observers, both domestic and international, agreed that the elections were carried out in an orderly fashion.\nOn September 2, the two presidential candidates signed a communiqu\u00e9, which outlined ten \"matters of concern\" to be dealt with \"immediately\". The agreement laid out a framework for cooperation on issues such as security and a weapons ban. There was a declaration to condemn \"all actions of intimidation, harassment and use of provocative language, physical violence directed at any person/persons or the malicious destruction of property for any reason.\"\nOne group of election monitors from the U.S.-based National Democratic Institute for International Affairs (NDIIA) expressed their satisfaction with the election process. \"Despite heightened tension and several reported instances of election-related violence during the campaign period, the delegation considers that the overall electoral process was generally transparent and peaceful,\" said NDIIA in a statement on September 10.\nThe September 8 run-off elections followed the first round of presidential and parliamentary elections held on August 11, which were the second held since 2002 after the end of the civil war. Opposition leader Koroma, 54, garnered 44 percent of the vote, while Berewa, 69, won 38 percent support. Should Koroma win ultimately, it would mark the APC's return to power for the first time since it was overthrown in a 1992 coup.\nIn a statement following Saturday's run-off elections, the spokesperson for the UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon expressed Mr. Ban's support for the process. \"The Secretary-General is pleased to note that the second round of the presidential election in Sierra Leone took place on September 8 in a generally orderly and peaceful atmosphere, in spite of the tensions and violence that marred the campaign period. The Secretary-General urges the political parties and people of Sierra Leone to exercise restraint as counting of the ballots proceeds and to resolve all arising disputes through the existing legal channels.\"\nSpokesman for the U.S. Department of State Sean McCormack relayed the sentiment of the administration. \"The United States congratulates the Republic of Sierra Leone for the peaceful presidential run-off electoral process on September 8, 2007. We commend the independent National Electoral Commission, the Sierra Leone Police, and especially the people of Sierra Leone for the overall calm and sense of order shown as voters cast their ballots.\"\nThe winning candidate will take over from current president Ahmad Tejan Kabbah who, by law, must step down after his current, second term in office."}

These reports surfaced because FINA, the international governing body of the sport, had discovered that Tunisian authorities had known about the positive test and only given him a warning. The rules state that when an athlete tests positive for a banned substance, he or she must be given a 2 year ban from the sport. Therefore, FINA had taken the case to the Court of Arbitration for Sport. Finally, after months of speculation, yesterday Oussama Mellouli lost his case before that Court.\nHe escaped the worst possible punishment, because the timing and the retroactive status of the suspension give Mellouli a chance to compete in the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, where he is a favorite in several medium distance races. \nHowever, he loses the distinction of having become the first Arab world champion in the history of competitive swimming (in 800 m freestyle), and loses another silver medal (in 400 m freestyle) from his best-ever showing at the Australian world championships."}

Serapio who also faced similar charges of plunder and perjury were proclaimed not guilty.\nA special division of the anti-graft court was created to specifically hear the case of Estrada and found beyond reasonable doubt that the former President was guilty of plunder.\nThe court's decision stated that Estrada received money from illegal gambling and collected commissions from the sale of publicly listed Belle Corp. shares. \nThe court stated that it found not enough evidence to tie Estrada to charges of misappropriating tobacco excise taxes and amassing wealth deposited in the so-called \"Jose Velarde\" account. \nThe 262-page decision stated that, \"The predicate acts alleged [in the two cases] were linked by the fact that they were plainly geared towards a common goal which was the accumulation of ill-gotten wealth ... and that they shared a pattern or a common method of commission which was the abuse or misuse of the high authority or power of the presidency.\" \nAs a result of the court's decision, the state will forfeit Mr. Estrada\u2019s accounts that includes P545.29 million (US$11.5 million) credited to the Erap Muslim Youth Foundation and the P189-million (US$ 4.10 million) Velarde account, including the so-called Boracay Mansion in New Manila, Quezon City.\nEstrada, who was also a popular movie actor said in an interview after the verdict that the three person panel of judges of the anti-graft court were \"pressured\" to ensure the legitimacy of the incumbent administration of President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo.\nMrs. Arroyo assumed the office of the President on January 20, 2001 when a peaceful uprising forced Mr. Estrada to step down from office.\nThe 70-year-old former President declared this Sunday that his lawyers will appeal should the court find him guilty and he is prepared to face incarceration. Estrada added that he will not ask for any form of pardon from incumbent President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo who assumed office when Estrada was ousted.\nMr. Estrada proclaimed before members of media after the verdict was read saying, \"I submitted myself to the rule of law when I allowed the impeachment proceedings against me to take its course. I did not resort to influence, the trial nor to any acts that may constitute obstruction of justice, whitewash or cover-ups.\" \nThe former president re-emphasized his position that he will never ask for any form of pardon from Mrs. Arroyo's administration and he was prepared to serve his sentence at the National Penitentiary among the common people with no special privileges.\nEstrada, has been on detention by virtue of a \"house arrest\" at his rest house at Tanay in Rizal Province, east of the capital Manila. \n\"I am at peace with myself notwithstanding the guilty verdict because you, my beloved countrymen, have overwhelmingly acquitted me,\" Estrada added.\nThe Philippine government placed the entire military and police on its highest level of alert, more than a week ahead in preparation for the Estrada verdict. \nTraffic around the anti-graft court was re-routed and classes from among nearby schools were also suspended to pre-empt any possible security problems resulting from pro-Estrada supporters.\nOn May 1, 2001, thousands of Estrada supporters amassed before Malaca\u00f1an Palace to protest the incarceration of the former President and attempted to unseat Mrs. Arroyo to restore Estrada.\nThe office of President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo appealed before the public to \"let the rule of law prevail.\"\nMrs. Arroyo stated during a speech before a mix group of delegates at the Presidential palace calling for \"peace and reconciliation\" after the verdict has been rendered.\nThe president has also called for an end on \"political drama,\" to allow the country's economy progress to move forward with no fear from political instability."}

This affects leading carriers around the world, including SAS, Alaska Air 's Horizon Air subsidiary, Flybe, Japan Airlines, Austrian Airlines Group and Augsburg Airways, and covers around 60 aircraft.\nSAS and Horizon Air have grounded 27 and 15 aircraft respectively, while Flybe have grounded six. Another airline, Porter Airlines, which operates the type exclusively against any others, have pointed out that their aircraft have not undertaken enough flights to be affected by the measures.\nThe landing gear are manufactured in the United States by Goodrich Corporation. One industry analyst, Cameron Doerksen, said that he felt that although the incidents and groundings obviously constitute bad publicity, he feels it would not influence the decision of a carrier considering whether to purchase Q400s.

Goodrich stock rose 19 cents to $64.96 on the New York Stock Exchange.\nThe groundings have caused hundreds of flights to be cancelled, leaving thousands of passengers stranded every day.

The Meteorology Agency of Indonesia recorded the quake at a magnitude 6.9.\nThe epicenter was located 164 kilometers (102 miles) west, southwest of Bengkulu, Sumatra, Indonesia with a depth of 47 km (29.2 miles), and the Meteorology Agency recorded it at a depth of only 10 km (6.2 miles).\nThe Meteorological Agency issued a tsunami warning for the west coast of Sumatra, but was called off a short time later. The USGS did not believe a tsunami will occur saying \"the earthquake is not big enough\" and that they \"generally need to be over 7.2\" to generate one.\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) had issued a bulletin stating that \"no widespread destructive tsunami is expected based on historical earthquake data,\" but that there could be \"local tsunamis\" located \"not more than 100 k.m.\" from the quake's epicenter.\nThere is no word on any injuries, deaths or damage. The region has been almost continuously rattled by earthquakes and aftershocks since a major magnitude 8.4 quake struck the region on September 12 killing at least 13 people and injuring hundreds. Several towns report that most of their buildings have been destroyed.\nVolcanologists say that the domino effect of the quakes could make some volcanoes in the region active. \"We expect a triggering effect on volcanoes in the region which have already shown some activities in the last couple of years,\" said a Department of Earth Sciences Professor in Indonesia."}

The Center was opened to the public in 1971 and was envisioned as part of the National Cultural Center Act, which mandated that the independent, privately-funded institution would present a wide variety of both classical and contemporary performances, commission the creation of new artistic works, and undertake a variety of educational missions to increase awareness of the arts. \nIn a statement, Kennedy Center Chairman Stephen A. Schwarzman said that \"with their extraordinary talent, creativity and perseverance, the five 2007 honorees have transformed the way we, as Americans, see, hear and feel the performing arts.\"\nFleisher, 79, a member of the Peabody Institute's music faculty, is a pianist who lost use of his right hand in 1965 due to a neurological condition. He became an accomplished musician and conductor through the use of his left hand. At 67, he regained the use of his right hand. With the advent of Botox therapy, he was once more able to undertake two-hand performances in 2004, his first in four decades. \"I'm very gratified by the fact that it's an apolitical honor,\" Fleisher said. \"It is given by colleagues and professional people who are aware of what [an artist] has done, so it really is apolitical -- and that much more of an honor.\"\nMartin, 62, a comedian who has written books and essays in addition to his acting and stand-up comedy career, rose to fame during his work on the American television program Saturday Night Live in the 1970's. Schwarzman praised his work as that of a \"renaissance comic whose talents wipe out the boundaries between artistic disciplines.\" Martin responded to the honor saying, \"I am grateful to the Kennedy Center for finally alleviating in me years of covetousness and trophy envy.\" \nRoss, 63, was a product of Detroit's Brewster-Douglass Projects when as a teeager she and friends Mary Wilson and Florence Ballardis formed The Supremes, a ground-breaking Motown act. She portrayed singer Billie Holiday in the 1972 film \"Lady Sings the Blues\", which earned her an Oscar nomination and a Golden Globe award. \"Diana Ross' singular, instantly recognizable voice has spread romance and joy throughout the world,\" said Schwarzman. Ross said she was \"taken aback. It is a huge, huge honor and I am excited to be in this class of people.\" \nScorsese, 64, is one of the most accomplished directors the United States ever produced, whose work includes \"Mean Streets\", \"Taxi Driver\", \"GoodFellas\", \"Cape Fear\", \"The Last Temptation of Christ\" and \"The Departed\", for which he won a 2006 Academy Award for Best Director after being nominated eight times. Scorsese said, \"I'm very honored to be receiving this recognition from the Kennedy Center and proud to be joining the company of the very distinguished individuals who have received this honor in years past.\"\nWilson, 65, along with his brothers Dennis and Carl, formed the Beach Boys in 1961. They had a series of hits that included \"Surfin' U.S.A.\" and \"Wouldn't It Be Nice.\" Their 1966 album \"Pet Sounds\" is considered one of the most influential recordings in American music. \"This is something so unexpected and I feel extremely fortunate to be in the company of such great artists,\" said Wilson, who is currently on tour.\nThe Kennedy Center's board of trustees is responsible for selecting honorees for \"lifetime contributions to American culture through the performing arts.\" Previous honorees, including Elton John and Steven Spielberg, also submitted recommendations. A wide variety of people were under consideration, including Emanuel Ax, Evgeny Kissin, Renee Fleming, Laurence Fishburne, Francis Ford Coppola, Melissa Etheridge and Kenny Chesney.\nPresident Bush and first lady Laura Bush will attend the center's presentation at its opera house on December 2, 2007, which will broadcast on December 26 on CBS."}

In fact, Siemens hoped every industry in Taiwan to understand the opportunity and advances of process of automation and obtain information in it with the \"exiderdome\" show in Taiwan. Even though this show is chosen during Semicon Taiwan 2007, but the solution ratio for semiconductor industry is only 2 or 3 percents because Siemens had lot of views on combinations from lower to upper factories and transformations on life cycles of products for every industry not only semiconductor.\nCheng: This the only and the first time Siemens held \"exiderdome\" show in Taiwan because Siemens cooperated with many industries and companies such as Taipei 101, Taipower, Taipei MRT, AU Optronics, AMD, National Semiconductor and had lots of achievements. Also, Siemens AG Headquarter chose Taiwan with the promotion of development on every industry and enterprise for the needs of the process on enterprise and automation.\nSolutions on the Trend of Product Life Cycle.\nBrock: As of the Press Conference by SEMI on Tuesday, some of exhibitors remarked that lots of companies and enterprises in Taiwan should obtain new materials and upgrade production technologies because of trend of tracing new ideas and following the fashion by consumers, with those trends, how will Siemens have to do?\nHuang: Siemens played as a roll of a solution provider for industries such as prime silicon and esoteric materials. Currently, lots of factories are particular about \"product integration\" and \"quality than quantity\". Factories in Taiwan should also pay attention with the load of the industrial electricity, so that Siemens introduced \"Totally Integrated Power\" and \"Total Integrated Automation\" solutions for industries to the best result of reducing costs and unwanted waste at this \"exiderdome\" show.\nSiemens on other investments.\nBrock: As I knew, Siemens was ever remarkable at telecommunication industry in Europe and ever cooperated with BenQ to build a brand new \"BenQ-Siemens\" CI. Why Siemens withdrew this industry afterwards and the effect on other departments of Siemens?\nHuang: Surely, Siemens was ever well-known in telecommunication industry, but when the trend of communication generation (2G, CDMA, 3G, 3.5G, ...) changes rapidly, Siemens lag behind Motorola slowly in the innovation of communication products. Afterwards, Siemens withdrew this industry but didn't take any effect on other department such as electronics, RFID, and security. As people in Taiwan saw the night illumination devices at Taipei 101, Train of Taipei MRT, power supply on Taipower Co., Ltd., Siemens is surely proud with the achievement of them.\nCheng: We provided lots of solutions for different industries in Taiwan. To standardize the procession in every industry is what Siemens have to do currently. That's why we turned from the competitor to service provider.\nOther features on \"exiderdome\".\nBrock: Besides of the main two objects, is there any other feature on \"exideerdome\" in Taiwan?\nHuang: In this exhibition, we provide solutions based on power supply, RFID technology, automation and sensor, each industry has its unique own solution. Also, at the multimedia guide of Atrium 2, we set a virtual environment with rotated mirrors on 3 walls for visitors who can rapidly enjoy the moment of the automation world and understand the advantages of automation for enterprises. That's exactly matched with one of our main solution - \"Total Integrated Automation\".\nSiemens in Taiwan.\nHuang: After visiting the guides on 1F and 2F, you can witness the image and achievement by Siemens in Taiwan. Siemens has three branches in Taiwan and expand from the headquarter in Taipei. What Siemens do is to provide solutions for every industry, for the 2007 Semicon Taiwan, we also provide a standalone solution on semiconductor industry, and that's why we chose Xinyi Shopping Area as the place in Taiwan to exhibit.\nSummary.\nWe can often see some exhibitors set lounge or held special activity on the Xinyi Shopping Area outside of TWTC showground to show their enterprise image or new technology. At past some years of Taipei Telecom, some companies chose East Area in Taipei as their showing stage like TransAsia Corporation. But in Computex Taipei, not only East Area in Taipei, but also Xinyi Shopping Area. Some of companies or exhibitors may invest some cost on the advertisement outside TWTC such as footbridge between Taipei 101 and TWTC or NYNY Department Store. Those were the good effect for some of trade shows in Taipei.\nAt Semicon Taiwan 2007, an exhibitor Siemens rented A13 Parking lot and imported containers to Taiwan to exhibit their results and solutions and had a good effect and promotion on exhibitions, and surely showed the excellence of their solution and image. We can predict that sideshow will be a great focus outside of main exhibition."}

The nut and bolt were vital to the locking mechanism for the starboard landing gear, and consequently the structure collapsed.\nThe SLV does not specifically address why this occurred, but according to SLV spokesman Thorbjoern Ancker the problem is a design flaw, and not a maintenance issue as previously suspected. In his own words, 'All speculation that this was an error by SAS is now shown to be wrong... It's a constructional weakness.' He explained that Bombardier maintenance documents supplied with the aircraft did not require maintenance personnel to inspect the bolt in question, and that accordingly this had not been done.\nPending completion of landing gear inspections by SAS, Norwegian, Swedish and Danish authorities will make a decision regarding whether the air carrier's Q400 fleet should remain grounded, or be permitted to resume operations.\nA spokesman for Bombardier refused to comment on the findings when contacted by reporters, preferring instead to wait until the publication of the final report into the accident. He did, however, make one comment regarding speculation that SAS would be compensated if the accident was proven to be the responsibility of the supplier, saying, \"That will be part of the discussions between Bombardier and airlines.\"\nScandinavian Airlines have canceled 111 flights today as their Q400s are grounded per Air Transport Canada orders, while SAS have concealed 110 flights today and tomorrow while their aircraft are grounded. \nBombardier have circulated a document to all operators of the type, containing advice recommending a revised inspection program.\nShares in Bombardier fell 14 cents, or 2.2%, to CA$6.21 and most recent reports have them at $6.25. The company is therefore currently valued at $11 billion. Goodrich, who manufactured the equipment, fell 9 cents, or 0.1%, to US$65.11. SAS, who own Scandinavian Airlines, fell 2.25 kronor, or 1.9%, to 115.75 kronor. A continuing fall in SAS shares prices over the last six weeks has almost negated all gains this year."}

Researchers call it an \"extreme\" situation and say that the ice is now shrinking at a level of about three million square kilometers a year, up from one million square kilometers per year in 2005.\n\"The strong reduction in just one year certainly raises flags that the ice may disappear much sooner than expected,\" said DNSC spokesman Leif Toudal Pedersen in a statement.\nThe new findings have put Canada and the United States at a standoff, both laying claim to the passage because it could be a valuable resource for the shipping industry. The passage goes through the boundaries of both nations. In 1985 diplomatic relations on the passage were strained after a U.S. icebreaker passed through without the U.S. notifying Canadian officials.\nAs a result, the Canadian military is building two new bases at both ends of the areas they claim to be theirs. There will also be at least six new naval patrol ships built, that will be stationed in the passage.\nThe U.S. claims that regardless which country boundaries the passage passes through, the waterway should be open to anyone who wants to use it.\n\"We believe it's an international passage,\" said U.S. President George W. Bush.\nDenmark, Norway, and Russia all also lay claim to the vast amounts of minerals, natural gas, and oil."}

The illness had been unidentified until laboratory test results confirmed the presence of the virus.\nDRC President Joseph Kabila described the situation as being contained. \"The village of Kampungu has been quarantined to prevent population movement towards Kananga,\" Kabila said on Thursday. Kananga is the provincial capital. \"The situation is at the moment, I cannot say under control, but at least the problem has been contained very well in the area,\" he continued. \"There is no risk that the whole country will be affected.\"\nWHO is working closely with officials from the DRC Ministry of Health and MSF to improve local facilities in order to better contain the virus. A mobile field laboratory is to be established in order to provide rapid sample analysis and, subsequently, diagnosis of patients. There are concurrent outbreaks of other diseases, such as dysentery (Shigellosis), that have been complicating diagnoses and need to be identified as well. \nEbola haemorrhagic fever generates mortality rates in the range of 50 to 90 percent, typically. There is currently no vaccine or effective treatment for Ebola. WHO describes the symptoms of Ebola as being \"characterized by the sudden onset of fever, intense weakness, muscle pain, headache and sore throat. This is often followed by vomiting, diarrhoea, rash, impaired kidney and liver function, and in some cases, both internal and external bleeding. Laboratory findings show low counts of white blood cells and platelets as well as elevated liver enzymes.\"\nMSF, who now have 14 experts in DRC, arranged for eighteen tons of supplies, such as medical and sanitation material, to be delivered to the province of West Kasai. MSF indicated that the transportation of supplies from the airport to the affected areas has been a challenge, due to poor road conditions. It has taken up to three days to travel the 250 km to the outbreak area from the provincial capital city, Kananga. \nMSF experts will provide advice on sanitary burial procedures, which would include the use of body bags and spraying. Both the WHO and MSF will disseminate information to the local population regarding the transmission of the virus and measures that could be taken to reduce the spread of the disease. \nThe MSF emergency team coordinator in Kampungu, Rosa Crestani, described the isolation ward set up at Kampungu's health centre. \"Our isolation centre is basically divided in three parts. One is completely isolated, where the sick patients are; another is where the staff dresses with the complete protection uniform and then undresses after having been in contact with the patients; and the third part is a space for disinfection in between,\" said Crestani. \"In the coming days, we will decide with the Ministry of Health and the WHO whether we set up isolation structures in other locations of the health zone.\"\nNeighbouring countries, such as Rwanda and Zambia have issued alerts to their citizens, warning of travel to and from DRC. Zambian Health Minister Brian Chituwo stated that all people coming into Zambia from DRC will be watched for symptoms of Ebola for up to eight hours. Chituwo noted, however that it would be unlikely for an infected person to travel into the country, as the time between onset and death is very rapid and that the symptoms are severe.\nThere has been a minimum of 395 people affected by haemorrhagic fever, including 160 deaths, in DRC in the past few months. Since arriving in Kampungu in early September, MSF have seen 25 patients admitted with suspected Ebola haemorrhagic fever, of which eight have died."}

According to court documents obtained by Wikinews, Chambers has decided to sue God, looking for a judge to issue a \"permanent injunction\" against the highest power.\nChambers says in his suit that God has spread fear across the globe causing \"widespread death, destruction and terrorization of millions upon millions of the Earth's inhabitants. [God also caused] fearsome floods, horrendous hurricanes, earthquakes, plagues, famine, genocidal wars, birth defects, terrifying tornadoes and the like\" and he wants the courts to order God \"to cease certain harmful activities and the making of terroristic threats.\"\nThe suit is in an apparent retaliation for a recent ruling where the words 'rape' and 'victim' were banned from a recent criminal case involving a sexual assault incident. The woman who was assaulted, Tory Bowen, filed a lawsuit against Jeffrey Cheuvront, a district judge in the city of Lancaster when he banned the use of those words in her criminal case. Chambers says that her lawsuit is \"frivolous\" and he filed his suit to show people that \"anybody can sue anybody.\"\n\"This lawsuit having been filed and being of such questionable merit creates a circumstance where my lawsuit is appropriately filed. People might call it frivolous but if they read it they'll see there are very serious issues I have raised.\" stated Chambers. \"The Constitution requires that the courthouse doors be open, so you cannot prohibit the filing of suit. Anyone can sue anyone they choose, even God,\" he added.\nRichard Kopf, a U.S. District Judge has ordered that Bowen must show evidence to support her lawsuit, saying that her case does not have \"any legal basis whatsoever\" until she does so.\nIt is not known when or if any additional hearings have been scheduled. Mr Chambers complaint consists of in part, \"despite reasonable efforts to effectuate personal service on Defendant God has been unable to do so.\"\nAttempts by a \"Wired News\" reporter to contact God for comment were not successful."}

It emitted a sweet but noxious odor. It has now been blamed for a mass illness affecting roughly 200 villagers with \"nausea, vomiting, digestive problems and general sickness,\" according to a local health department official, Jorge L\u00f3pez. \"Boiling water started coming out of the crater and particles of rock and cinders were found nearby. Residents are very concerned,\" said L\u00f3pez.\nPolice officers who went to investigate the meteorite are among those who have fallen ill and been taken to Desaguadero Hospital. The impact of the meteorite left a crater 18 feet deep and 30 yards across in the Andean territory that is home to less than 1,000 people. Originally, the villagers thought a plane had crashed. Under consideration is the declaration of a state of emergency. \nPeruvian Nuclear Energy Institute engineer Renan Ramirez said scientists who went to investigate the crater found no indication of radiation, although, the fumes from the crater were so pungent that one scientist said his throat and nose were irritated despite his use of a mask.\nVillagers are said to be avoiding the local water out of fear of contamination. Sulfur, arsenic and other elements common in meteorites can react with ground water to produce fumes. Ursula Marvin, a meteor expert at the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory in Massachusetts, said a meteorite \"wouldn't get much gas out of the earth\" and that a more likely explanation for the health problems was the dust cloud caused when the rock hit the Earth.\nOther explanations abound. Don Yeomans, head of the Near Earth Object Program at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, said \"Statistically, it's far more likely to have come from below than from above,\" noting that meteorites do not give off smells and it is likely the result of hydrothermal activity, such as a local gas explosion. Dr Caroline Smith, a meteorite expert with the Natural History Museum in London, thought more likely the villagers saw a common fireball and in the process of investigating it, did not find a 'crater' but \"a lake of sedimentary deposit, which may be full of smelly, methane rich organic matter.\" And one science blogger, David Syzdek, theorized that in fact the crater is a mud volcano \"that is producing toxic gasses [sic] such as methane, water, and perhaps other hydrocarbons. Many hydrocarbons can cause illness.\""}

The Dawn probe, costing over US$250 million, will visit the dwarf planet Ceres and the asteroid Vesta. The launch was originally planned for mid-June, however due to a damaged crate, shipping delays, and a damaged solar panel, NASA chose to delay it until now. Last week the spacecraft was delivered to the launch pad, and engineers performed tests to ensure that it is ready for launch. Today, the payload fairings were installed, and the probe is ready for its launch next week onto its 5 billion kilometer (3.2 billion mile) mission.\nAs the Delta II launches, three stages of rockets will propel the probe towards its first target. With the help of ion thrusters, it will reach Mars in mid-2009. Using Mars' gravity, the probe will speed up and proceed towards the first asteroid, Vesta, in late 2011. After orbiting for seven months, it will leave Vesta in mid-2012, and arrive at Ceres in 2015. After making scans of Ceres, it will enter an orbit around Ceres that will ensure that it does not impact the asteroid for half a century. This is required due to the United Nations' \u201cOuter Space Treaty\u201d, which states that \u201charmful contamination\u201d of these asteroids must be avoided.\nThe targets of this mission, Ceres and Vesta, couldn't be less alike. Ceres (diameter 975 km, 600 miles) is larger than Vesta (578 km, 350 miles). This makes Ceres approximately the size of Texas. NASA believes Ceres could contain water beneath its outer crust because, like Earth, its inner layers are heavier than the outer layers, and Ceres' outer layer is lighter than water. Vesta, on the other hand, is the size of Arizona, and has a surface of volcanic rock, which astronomers believe came from its hot inner layers. Vesta also has a large crater \u2013 almost 500 km (300 miles) across \u2013 on its southern pole. The collision that caused this likely blasted enough rock into space to fill a container 160 by 160 by 80 km (100 by 100 by 50 miles).\nThe probe will make several observations of these asteroids: it will compare the makeup, shape, size, and densities, analyze craters, and determine mass, gravity, rotation. To determine the makeup, the probe carries a mapping spectrometer, and tools to map emissions of neutrons and gamma rays. Using this information, NASA can compare the formation of these bodies to learn more about our solar system, for example, to test a theory which states that a number of stony meteorites may be debris from Vesta.\nThere's one more piece of equipment aboard the probe: A small silicon chip containing the names of 350,000 people who submitted their names to the \u201cSend Your Name to the Asteroid Belt\u201d campaign. After next week's launch, the spacecraft will deploy its solar panels and undergo two months of testing before it begins the cruise to Mars."}

The ad called \"GORGEOUS YORKSHIRE TERRIER FOR FREE GRAB HER NOW!!!\" had a picture of a \"Yorkie\" in a white basket.\nThe seller of the puppy asked the women over the phone to pay $200 for the shipping fee, the next day he asked for $250 to put the dog in a crate, and again the next day $50 for ownership. He did not tell her it would amount to $500. On the third day he asked for $100 for a shot for his puppy. She immediately contacted authorities.\n\"Are you trying to call me a scam?

Some analysts say that the Federal Reserve's September 18th dramatic rate cut to 4.75% from 5.25% may be a case of \"too little, too late\", or that it was excessive and dooms the dollar.\nToday, Saudi officials declined to cut interest rates in lockstep with the US Federal Reserve for the first time in decades. According to Ambrose Evans-Pritchard, International Business Editor for The Daily Telegraph, \"it's a signal that the oil-rich Gulf kingdom is preparing to break the dollar currency peg in a move that risks setting off a stampede out of the dollar across the Middle East.\"\nHans Redeker, the Currency Chief at BNP Paribas, also stated today that Saudi Arabia's move to not adjust their own interest rates in sync with the Fed's cuts is a very dangerous situation for the US dollar. Redeker points out that \"Saudi Arabia has $800bn (\u00a3400bn) in their future generation fund, and the entire region has $3,500bn under management. They face an inflationary threat and do not want to import an interest rate policy set for the recessionary conditions in the United States.\"\nSaudi central bank officials said that \"appropriate measures\" would be taken to stop the large capital inflows into the country. The Federal Reserve's half-point rate cut has already caused a plunge in the world dollar index to a fifteen-year low, reaching the weakest level ever against the Euro at just under $1.40.\nThe Fed hopes that by making it cheaper to borrow, people will start spending and investing more. However, some analysts fear the cut will worsen inflation, making it harder to get personal loans, and further decrease confidence in the dollar around the world. There are already signs that global investors have started rejecting U.S. Treasury securities, and recent U.S. government data on foreign holdings show a decline in purchases of US securities from $97bn to just $19bn in July. \nIn response to Ben Bernanke's statements today about a potential mortgage and housing market crisis, CNN anchor Wolf Blitzer said, \"If adjustable mortgage rates go up, people may not be able to afford their mortgage payments.\" Former Federal Reserve chief Alan Greenspan said earlier this week that housing prices may fall by \"double digits\" as the subprime crisis bites harder, prompting households to cut back sharply on spending.\nJim Rogers, the economic commentator and former partner of George Soros, stated, \"If Ben Bernanke starts running those printing presses even faster than he's already doing, we are going to have a serious recession. The dollar's going to collapse, the bond market's going to collapse. There's going to be a lot of problems.\"\nIn recent months, the U.S. dollar has taken several other significant hits including Kuwait's decision in May to also break its dollar peg, and threats by China to interfere with the U.S. economy, calling it their nation's \"nuclear option\". According to public sources, the Chinese government has begun a concerted campaign of economic threats against the United States, hinting that it may liquidate its vast holding of US treasuries if Washington imposes trade sanctions that seek to force a Yuan revaluation."}

Massport spokeswoman Lisa Langone described the device as a fake bomb strapped to her chest. The woman was identified as Star Simpson, a second year student from Hawaii attending the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). Simpson was asking for information on her boyfriend's arriving flight from Oakland at an information desk when the police were notified.\nPolice say that the device was made from a computer circuit board (in fact a white breadboard as used in MIT course 6.002 (Circuits and Electronics) laboratory kits), LED lights forming a \"star\" shape, and wiring. The wiring was connected to a 9V battery, allowing the device to light up. According to Maj. Scott Pare of the Massachusetts State Police, Simpson stated that she had created the device as a piece of art that she created to stand out at a career fair. It was attached to the front of a black sweatshirt with a hood that Simpson was wearing, the sweatshirt had \"Socket to me, Course VI\" written on the back. She was holding Play-doh. She was arrested at about 8:00 a.m. Police say that the device was part of \"art\" and that Simpson is cooperating with the investigation.\n\"This is a serious event and was handled quickly and safely. She claims this was art and just wanted to display the art. She didn't understand the seriousness of the situation and she is lucky we did not use deadly force because we had machine guns on scene,\" said authorities during a press conference at 11:00 a.m. today.\n\"She's extremely lucky she followed the instructions or deadly force would have been used. And she's lucky to be in a cell as opposed to the morgue,\" said Pare.\nPare later said that, \"[Simpson] did seem a bit upset that she was in custody. However, she was rational, and she did answer all questions as required.\"\nSimpson reportedly arrived to at the airport via the subway. She was wearing the device during her trip on the subway, and had in fact been wearing the device during an MIT job fair the previous day. \nSimpson was arraigned today on charges including disturbing the peace and possessing a hoax device. Assistant Suffolk District Attorney Wayne Margolis requested a $5,000 cash bail, stating that Simpson had shown \"a total disregard to understand the context of the situation\u2026an airport post-9/11.\" Ross Schreiber, Simpson's defense attorney, called the amount \"completely unreasonable\" on the grounds that she had not pretended the circuit was anything else and that she was a student in good standing at MIT. Simpson pleaded not guilty to the charges and was released on $750 bond.\nFellow MIT classmates reportedly describe Simpson as \"impulsive\" and \"creative.\""}

Like many rejuvenated communities in the United States, Posner's historic south Fifth Street has become the Tribeca of Miami, a fashionable, trendy nightspot with a maelstrom of growth in hotels, restaurants and boutiques that have out-priced many long-term residents. \nLocal activist Frank Del Vecchio asked Posner if she would appear in the eight-minute \"Close the Loophole\" video, directed by Emmy award-winning documentarian Robyn Symon, to state her belief that a loophole that allows popular local restaurants such as Prime One Twelve and Devito South Beach to exist in her residential neighborhood should be amended to limit the amount of seats in the establishments in proportion to their number of rooms. Her segment began, \"Hi, I'm Trisha Posner. I'm a journalist and columnist for \"Ocean Drive\" magazine. I am married to Gerald Posner, the author.\" Within a few hours after her appearance, she was fired by \"Ocean Drive\" publisher Jerry Powers. \nPosner was aghast and bewildered. Attractive and comely, as a health columnist she is an unlikely candidate as a civic instigator; but those qualities belie Posner's buffalo stance on doing what she feels is right for her community. \"I hate being in the public eye and I prefer to be low key,\" Posner told Wikinews in an interview. \"To do the video I was nervous. Only in person do I feel comfortable.\" Wikinews reporter recently spoke with Posner.\nDS: What were the circumstances surrounding your dismissal?&lt;br&gt;\nDS: Did you receive a call from Jerry Powers?&lt;br&gt;\nDS: Had you informed the magazine of your appearance beforehand?&lt;br&gt;\nDS: Did you ever have any other problems at the magazine?&lt;br&gt;\nDS: Why do you think Powers fired you?&lt;br&gt;\nDS: Has any other employee of \"Ocean Drive\" appeared publicly before and been identified as such?&lt;br&gt;\nDS: Your husband, author Gerald Posner, wrote a piece in \"The Huffington Post\" about your dismissal. Several of the comments to it state that since \"Ocean Drive\" is a large glossy magazine dependent upon advertising from the entertainment industry, that you bit the hand that fed you. How do you respond to such criticism?&lt;br&gt;\nDS: Some of the comments that were made in HuffPo were that even though it was despicable that you were fired for expressing your opinion on a civic matter, that you should have expected it. Do you think comments like that are par for the course of apathy in the United States today, where people disagree with something, but shrug their shoulders instead?&lt;br&gt;\nDS: Another comment said, \"The magazine itself sounds like a total contribution of everything that [is] wrong with America right now. Instead of promoting smart growth and longevity, it prostitutes itself to every new development, even at the cost of other developments (advertisers) who will lose out when this new one opens.\" What are your thoughts on the magazine?&lt;br&gt;\nDS: What are your feelings about Jerry Powers?&lt;br&gt;"}

The idea to the video is just as wild as the cover song itself: a battle metal band covering a 70's disco hit. Just as the song, it is a crossover of the 70's kitsch attached to the Boney M. track, but performed by us as we do it. Director Vesa-Matti Vainio and the whole crew did a great job on this one and to me, this is a good pick for our first video ever. I assure you, there are plenty of ideas on epic spectacles to be looked into later.\u201d\nHe goes on to explain how the unusual cover came to be in the first place: \"We've been begged to record Rasputin pretty much since we first played it live a couple of years back. It's amazing how popular this cover version of ours have become at our gigs during the last year and it really makes us feel like we must have done something right here looking at big crowds going totally mental over a 70's disco hit! I remember getting the idea for this cover years back - in 2001 I think. I was on a ferry trip between Finland and Sweden and there was this cover band performing 70's disco hits. The minute they blasted 'Rasputin' I knew, that at some point, we would need to do it in some form or another. It was just obvious that it would work amazingly well given a slightly more modern and heavier touch-up. Personally I've always preferred these old 70's disco bands\". \nExternal links.\n "}

This is the right thing to do and indeed, it is required by the existing norms of free speech\"\nBollinger then gave his opening address, turning to Ahmadinejad and stating:\nAfter reciting the and asking for guidance from God, Ahmadinejad countered that \"In Iran, tradition requires that when we invite a person to be a speaker, we actually respect our students and the professors by allowing them to make their own judgment and we don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessary before the speech is even given to come in with a series of claims...\" \nAhmadinejad's most pointed arguments, though, were directed at the administration of George W. Bush. \"They do not respect the privacy of their own people. They tap telephone calls \u2026 They create an insecure psychological atmosphere, in order to justify their war-mongering acts in different parts of the world.\" \nThe Iranian president attacked what he considered to be errors of American imperialism. \"By using precise scientific methods and planning, they begin their onslaught on the domestic cultures of nations, which are the result of thousands of years of interaction, creativity and artistic activity. They try to eliminate these cultures in order to strip people of their identity.\"\nAhmadinejad questioned U.S. nuclear policy. \"Making nuclear, chemical and biological bombs and weapons of mass destruction is yet another result of the misuse of science and research by the big powers.\" He added, \"Without the cooperation of certain scientists and scholars, we would not have witnessed production of different nuclear, chemical and biological weapons. Are these weapons to protect global security? What can a perpetual nuclear umbrella achieve for the sake of humanity? If nuclear war is waged between nuclear powers, what human catastrophe will take place?\"\nIn a rebuttal to claims that his country oppressed women and homosexuals, Ahmadinejad responded by claiming \"It is wrong for some governments, when they disagree with another government, to...spread lies\", pointing to the fact that over 50% of Iranian voters are female, and the two female Vice Presidents. When challenged by Bollinger for he stated that \"In Iran we don't have homosexuals like in your country,\" drawing laughter from the audience. \"In Iran we do not have this phenomenon, I don't know who has told you that we have it.\" \nHe framed as stifled academic debate: \"Right now, there are a number of European academics who have been sent to prison because they attempted to write about the Holocaust or research it from a different perspective, questioning certain aspects of it,\" later adding that \"you shouldn't ask me why I'm asking questions, you should ask yourselves why you...want to stop. Do you ever take what is known as absolute in physics? We had principles in mathematics that were granted to be absolute for over 800 years, but new science has...gone forward.\"\nThe first question from the audience addressed the controversial issue of the leader's position on Israel. Ahmadinejad did not directly respond to the subject of Israel - stating \"We love all nations. We love the Jewish people. There are many Jews living in Iran, with peace and security.\", and concluded that it was not a question of Israel's right to exist, but of Palestinian self-determination. \nCountering claims that his country supports terrorism, he replied, \"We\u2019re a cultured nation. We don\u2019t need to resort to terrorism. We\u2019ve been victims of terrorism ourselves. It\u2019s regrettable that people who argued they are fighting terrorism \u2014 instead of supporting the Iranian nation \u2014 are supporting the terrorists and then turn the finger at us.\"\nThe final question from the audience asked whether Iran would engage in talks with the United States, to which he replied \"If the U.S. government recognizes the rights of the Iranian people, respects all nations and extends a hand of friendship to all Iranians, they will see that Iranians will be among their best friends.\"\nIn closing, Ahmadinejad extended gratitude and thanks to the University, and welcomed both students and faculty to attend Iranian universities and give lectures themselves to the students."}

Under the proposal, previously approved by the state Senate and Assembly and signed by the governor Jon Corzine, New Jersey would borrow US$450 million over a ten-year period to be used to fund stem cell research. Shuster's ruling was in response to a suit by the pro-life Legal Center for the Defense of Life on behalf of 15 New Jersey residents and the anti-abortion group New Jersey Right to Life.\nThe suit asked for an injunction to keep the proposal off the ballot, arguing that the ballot measure was deceptive since it did not reveal that the funding might go to human cloning and that property taxes might be raised as a means of paying off the debt. Proponents of the measure argued that the bill would not in fact allow cloning and that allowing the use of property tax to pay off debt was standard for similar ballot measures. \nShuster ruled that the plaintiffs had waited too long to file their case and that they did not made a convincing enough claim of imminent harm to justify the unusual and disruptive measure of removing an item from the ballot. An injunction now would create complications to military personnel who vote by mail as well as civilians who use absentee ballots. \nStem cell research has been a controversial topic in the United States, where it is wrapped up in the abortion debate. Opponents, principally religious groups, have condemned such research when it would use embryonic stem cells which they view as endorsement of abortion. Since many of them view abortion as murder, the use of embryonic stem cells is in their eyes tantamount to murdering people for scientific research. Also, some have expressed concern that the research is a slippery slope to reproductive cloning. In response to funding restrictions on federal money to stem cell research and an earlier veto by President Bush of a federal bill for stem cell research a number of states such as New Jersey and California have adopted measures to fund stem cell research, which proponents argue could be useful for curing a variety of diseases, including Alzeimer's, Parkinson's and diabetes."}

He rose to national prominence for his strong stance against illegal immigration and his announcement that he was a Republican candidate in the 2008 Presidential election. recently spoke with the Congressman and posed questions from Wikipedia editors and Wikinews reporters:\nDS: Throughout my life my father, a lifelong Republican and an avid listener of Rush Limbaugh, told me that all we needed in this country was a Republican Congress, Republican Senate and a Republican White House to get this country on the right track. Last year he expressed his disappointment to me. So many Republicans, like my father, feel lied to or let down by the party. The rationale for the Iraq War, the sex and bribery scandals, the pork barrel projects, and, as Alan Greenspan recently pointed out, the fiscal irresponsibility. People feel there have been many broken promises. Why should someone vote Republican today?&lt;br&gt;\nDS: You yourself said you would only serve three terms in Congress, but then broke that promise. What caused you to reverse yourself?&lt;br&gt;\nDS: There are an estimated 12 million illegal aliens in the U.S. To round up and deport millions of people would be a major government undertaking, requiring massive federal spending and invasive enforcement. What level of funding would be necessary for U.S. Immigration and Customs to achieve the level of enforcement that you'd like to see?&lt;br&gt;\nDS: How long would full enforcement take for you to succeed?&lt;br&gt;\nDS: Can you explain your remarks about bombing the Islamic holy sites of Mecca and Medina as a deterrent to terrorists operating against the United States.&lt;br&gt;\nDS: But wouldn\u2019t an attack on Mecca and Medina be an attack on a sovereign state?&lt;br&gt;\nDS: Aside from becoming President, if you could be granted three wishes, what would they be?&lt;br&gt;\nDS: Farmers rely heavily on seasonal manual labor. Strict enforcement of immigration laws will inevitably reduce the pool of migrant labor and thus increase costs. Do you support tariffs or other government intervention to keep American farm products competitive?&lt;br&gt;\nDS: Do you agree that our forefathers intended birthright citizenship? &lt;br&gt;\nDS: You and Karl Rove engaged, in your words, in a screaming match over immigration, and Rove said that you would never again \"darken the doorstep of the White House.\" Are you still considered \"persona non grata\" at the White House?&lt;br&gt;\nDS: Psychologist Robert Hare has discussed in his work the use of doublespeak as a hallmark of psychopaths, and social scientists have pointed out that the use of doublespeak is most prevalent in the fields of law and politics. Do these two trends alarm you?&lt;br&gt;\nDS: What is the proper role of Congress in the time of war?&lt;br&gt;\nDS: Politics is dominated by lawyers. What other group of people or professions would you prefer to see dominate the field of politics and why?&lt;br&gt;\nDS: Do you think lawyers are better for handling legislation and as politicians? &lt;br&gt;\nDS: You have supported proposed constitutional amendments that would ban abortion and same-sex marriage. You are also a strong supporter of the Second Amendment. Why do you believe that the U.S. Constitution should regulate medical procedures and personal relationships, but not gun ownership?&lt;br&gt;\nDS: You recently spoke out against the Black and Hispanic Congressional caucuses, stating, \"It is utterly hypocritical for Congress to extol the virtues of a color-blind society while officially sanctioning caucuses that are based solely on race. If we are serious about achieving the goal of a colorblind society, Congress should lead by example and end these divisive, race-based caucuses.\" Do you also believe there is no longer a need for the NAACP?\nDS: You were one of a handful of Republicans who voted for a bill proposed by Maurice Hinchey and Dana Rohrabacher to stop the Department of Justice from raiding medical marijuana patients and caregivers in states where medical marijuana is legal, citing states' rights concerns. On the other hand, you have suggested state legislators and mayors should be imprisoned for passing laws contrary to federal immigration law, and you support the Federal Marriage Amendment to ban gay marriage nationally. How do you reconcile these seemingly contradictory positions?\nDS: If you had to support one of the Democratic candidates, which one would it be and why?"}

Ahmadinejad's presence on one of the United States' most prestigious universities brought out protesters from many causes to make their opinions known: whether Ahmadinejad should speak or not, the war in Iraq, Israel,George W. Bush, American imperialism', God and morality, all of which created a powder keg of opinions which made the air feel as if at any moment it would explode into fisticuffs. \nAhmadinejad has been widely criticized for his anti-semitic remarks and as a holocaust denier, as well as Iran's support for terrorism. He also believes that 9/11 was an \u201cinside job\u201d, involving Israel's Mossad or American \u2018intelligence and security services.\u2019 9/11 family members have been loudly critical of Ahmadinejad, since last week when he requested a visit to Ground Zero to lay a wreath -- what has been widely viewed as a photo op.\nThe New York tabloid press splashed their covers with antagonizing headlines. The \"Daily News\" ran the headline \"The evil has landed\" and \"The New York Post\" labeled Ahmadinejad the \"Madman Iran Prez\". Since New York hosts the headquarters of the United Nations, whose charter requires that all member nations have access to the governing body, delegations of governments identified as enemies of the United States --North Korea, Cuba, Iran-- live and work in the city. At times, their governments come to address the governing body, as the Iranian President did on Monday. \nAhmadinejad's presence tore apart the usually close-knit community of students and academics that inhabit Columbia's enclave in Morningside Heights. \"A high-quality academic discussion depends on intellectual honesty,\" wrote Columbia Law Dean David M. Schizer, \"but, unfortunately, Mr. Ahmadinejad has proven himself, time and again, to be uninterested in whether his words are true. Therefore, my personal opinion is that he should not be invited to speak.\" The Columbia Conservative Alumni Association said \"the university is extending not a courtesy, but continuing a policy of anti-Israeli and anti-American leftist nihilism under the guise of academic freedom.\" \nRichard Bulliet, an Iranian expert at Columbia who was instrumental in arranging the visit, defended the notion that it is imperative to listen to one's enemies. \"If there is any likelihood of war between the U.S. and Iran, it is important for Americans to have some access to the direct words of the president of the other country. At least they are getting Ahmadinejad's views directly from him and not a reporter who has an ax to grind.\"\nSunsara Taylor, a member of the Revolutionary Communist Party and a student, had a mixed view. Although in theory Taylor did not have an issue with the Iranian President's presence on campus, she had a problem with \"The event without any intervention or debate from the students...is reinforcing a bad dynamic where people feel they need to choose between Islamic Fundamentalism and U.S. Imperialism. I think it's fine for him to speak, but I think it's a responsibility of people in this country not to be bamboozled into going along with a war against a country's people just because that country's leader is a reactionary.\" \nSources.\n "}

He flew a distance of 1,300 kilometres in a wheel well of a Boeing 737 and lived. The fifteen year old Andrey Scherbakov spent two hours in the wheel well of the airplane at extreme temperature of \u221250\u00b0 centigrade. The rear wheels do not go all the way into the plane; the wheel merely retracts into an opening and remains exposed. The boy managed to bypass security at the Perm city airport to hide in the plane as it took off. Airport workers found the boy after the plane had landed at Moscow. He had collapsed on the tarmac.\nThe boy was delivered to the hospital by the airport staff and is said to be in a critical condition. His arms and legs were so severely frozen and swollen that the rescuers were not able to remove his coat and shoes. There is a probability that his hands may have to be amputated. However, according to the medical staff at the hospital, it is nothing short of a miracle that the boy survived the ordeal. The Boeing 737 has a cruising speed of 900 kilometres per hour and was flying constantly at an altitude of 10,000 metres for two hours. As a result, the boy suffered severe frostbite in both of his hands. Doctors in Ural city would have to remove his fingertips, which contracted gangrene after they had frozen, but they were committed to do everything within their power to stop it from spreading.\nWhen Scherbakov finally came to his senses, he told the police that he had run away from his family so as to escape his alcoholic father. He said that he was wandering around the territory of the airport and noticed a hole in the fence. He fell asleep during his examination of the stowaway of the plane. He woke up when the plane was already flying. It is curious how the inspection staff and the technicians found nothing on their inspection of the aircraft just before the flight. The boy claims that he fainted soon after and came around only when the plane had landed in Moscow after traveling hundreds of kilometres from Perm.\nThe airport did not confirm the report. However, Moscow's air and water transport control department said that the claim was true. A department spokesperson said that the incident happened on Friday, and the boy's parents were immediately informed and flew into the capital on the same day.\nStowaways in wheel wells risk freezing to death after take-off or being crushed when the wheels retract.

In that film, VOA reports Nagai was \"thrown to the ground by a soldier and shot at close range.\" Tokyo based Yomiuri Shimbun reports the anonymous local testimonies of that incident: Nagai was shot from a near distance while he filmed the anti-government demonstration. The local testimonials state that military and polices aimed at many citizens with cameras.\nAfter being informed of the death of Nagai, the Japanese government demanded that the Burmese government investigate the death and punish the killer, Yomiuri reports. \nAPF, the Tokyo based news agency for which Nagai worked, reports that Reporters Without Borders, the Paris based non-profit, issued a protest against the Burmese government in response to his death. According to APF, RWB states Burmese government disturbs communications in several ways, including disturbance of cellular connection and blocking of blogs. According to Jiji, a Tokyo based newswire, RWB also requested Japanese government sanction of Myanmar. \nAlso, European Committee spokesperson accused the Burmese military government of being responsible for Nagai's death as well as all other violence in Burma. European Committee expresses their concern of the Burmese government attitude toward foreign press. "}

The airstrike, by an F-16 carrying two 500 lb bombs, came hours after a tip that al-Tunisi would be holding a meeting that day. \nHowever, al-Tunisi had been reported dead more than a year ago. \nThe Tunisian militant had come to American attention during the Second Battle of Fallujah in November 2004, and had overseen anti-aircraft missions and participated in the 2005 attack against Abu Ghraib. His death was reported by Abu al-Zarqawi's army on May 20, 2006 in an al-Hesbah communique later translated and released by FBI Terrorism consultant Evan Kohlmann. He was reportedly killed after a US helicopter attack in Yusufiyah killed him and four other insurgents.\nFollowing this week's bombing, Brig. Gen. Joseph Anderson addressed a press conference at the Pentagon stating that the death of al-Tunisi would \"fracture\" the Sunni insurgency within the country - claiming that the man was \"one of the most senior leaders\" and \"part of the inner leadership circle\". His name did not appear on the Iraqi Government's list of 41 Most Wanted.\nAnderson also stated that al-Tunisi's group, the Aisha Battalion of anti-aircraft operations, was responsible for the kidnappings and deaths of US soldiers in June of 2006, a month after he was reported killed. While the Army could not confirm which soldiers Anderson was referencing, a June 16 kidnapping led to the death of Spc. David J. Babineau, Pfc. Kristian Menchaca and Pfc. Thomas Tucker who were guarding a bridge into Baghdad. \nal-Tunisi was said to be a potential replacement for al-Qaeda in Iraq leader Abu Hamza al-Muhajir who was killed by tribesmen in May of this year. Multinational Force Iraq spokesman Maj. Winfield Danielson stated that \u201cThis is one more al-Qaeda in Iraq criminal who will never kill another innocent civilian,\u201d although all of al-Tunisi's known targets were American soldiers, not Iraqi civilians.\nWhile the military stated that they had \"definitively identified\" the body as being al-Tunisi, they refused to elaborate on their methods of verification - stating only that two captured Iraqis told them that it was al-Tunisi. Although a letter found inside the house referred to being \"desperate\" and being unable to travel outside the city - it was unsigned, and the only evidence that it was written by al-Tunisi was that it \"was with his belongings\".\nThe tip was confirmed by a local Iraqi arrested near the site of the house just before the bombing, which killed three. Military press releases reported that al-Tunisi's body had been \"definitively\" identified and that his handwriting was evident on papers inside the bombed house.\nKohlmann said the contradiction raised \"some pretty serious questions\", and that any claims that al-Tunisi could have faked his own death to deceive US military intelligence would be \"virtually unprecedented\" behaviour for the insurgents.\nIn May, the US military was forced to admit that Brig. Gen. Kevin Bergner's announcement declaring the death of al-Qaeda in Iraq lieutenant Kamal Jalil Uthman was incorrect after the San Francisco Examiner pointed out that the army had already reported Uthman killed a year earlier, in a document entitled \"Tearing Down al Qaeda\"."}

And others always know when they see Evan coming what it is that he wants.\nSince his time at Harvard Law School when he wrote a paper on the topic, what Wolfson wants is the right for gay people to marry. The issue gained national prominence in 1993 when the Hawaii Supreme Court held in \"Baehr v. Lewin\" that the government had to show a reason for the denial of the freedom to marry, not just deny marriage licenses to the plaintiff gay couples. Wolfson was co-counsel in the historic 1996 Hawaii trial in which he argued that the government does not have a sufficient reason for excluding same-sex couples from marriage. In 1999, Wolfson contributed to \"Baker v. Vermont\", the case that led to the creation of civil unions; advised the lead attorneys in \"Goodridge v. Department of Public Health\", the case that led to same-sex marriage in Massachusetts; and since 2003, when he founded the primary umbrella organization coordinating the efforts to win marriage for gay people, Freedom to Marry, Wolfson has played a role in every marriage equality case in the United States. He is the movement's founder and leader, and his focus remains square on winning that right. \"For years,\" said Matt Foreman, executive director of the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force, \"many of us were saying to him, 'We're not ready. The country's not ready. And, by the way, you're crazy.'\" \nWhen I make a statement to him about his devoting his life to gay marriage, he corrects me: \"I\u2019ve played a part in cases that span the entire spectrum of eliminating gay people\u2019s exclusions and limitations on who gay people are, and I\u2019ve also written on immigration and economic justice, and I have worked on cases involving race discrimination in jury selection and women\u2019s inequality. I don\u2019t think one has to pick one of these things; they work together.\"\nIndeed, he has. Wolfson was lead counsel before the Supreme Court in \"Boy Scouts of America v. Dale\", the case arguing against the expulsion of gay scoutmasters. As an intrepid young assistant district attorney in Brooklyn, Wolfson worked on \"People v. Liberta\" to end the exemption that allowed women to be raped by their husbands legally, a right in New York State as early as 1984. And he helped end the practice of choosing jurors based upon their race. \nWolfson's entire career has been at the center of the most explosive legal and cultural issues of the last 30 years in the United States, and his influence has been profound. sat down with him to discuss some of the recent decisions affecting gay marriage, gender in marriage and reactions in the gay community to his fight for their rights.\nWolfson and gay marriage.\nDS: You are one of the leaders, arguably the founder, of the modern gay marriage movement\u2014\nDS: The argument is posed that it\u2019s not the same given that marriage has traditionally been a heterosexual institution.\nDS: How has marriage changed recently?\nDS: That was here in New York?\nDS: How did you first become involved in the marriage issue and why was it something you decided to dedicate yourself to?\nDS: But why marriage and not immigration, or adoption? There are many areas where gay people are excluded from participation. Why do you personally focus on marriage?\nThe gay community and marriage.\nDS: It does not appear many gay people are galvanized to fight for the marriage right.\nDS: Larry Kramer, a very prominent gay critic of his own community, has taken it to task for its inaction and focusing on sex and having a good time instead of working to change their place in American society. But you are saying that there is no case of wider apathy amongst gays nor a relative disengagement with their issues? \nDS: Do you feel disappointment with the level of involvement of the gay community in the marriage issue?\nDS: In July of 2006 there was a proclamation that went out called Beyond Same-Sex Marriage. It was signed by a lot of well-known people: Cornel West, Armistead Maupin, Gloria Steinem, Terrence McNally. All friends of the gay movement\u2014\nDS: \u2014That proclamation said too many resources are going toward gay marriage. In a similar vein, one Wikipedia editor asked, \"Should we be fighting for the ultimate 'prize' of same-sex marriage when most states haven't even given the basic gay rights of non-discrimination in employment, non-discrimination in housing and non-discrimination in public places/accommodation?\"\nDS: Have any of the signatories rescinded their support of the Beyond Marriage statement?\nDS: What was the motivation behind the letter? People such as Richard Kim, associate editor of \"The Nation\" and one of the organizers, said it supported the notion that too many resources were going toward marriage fights.\nDS: Why not?\nDS: Are too many resources going toward marriage fights?\nDS: Some argue that marriage fights are \"too much, too soon\" and that it hurts the other fights; that it causes a backlash.\nThe Iowa and Maryland decisions.\nDS: Was it a win in Iowa, or was it a brief respite?\nDS: Last week, Maryland's Court of Appeals became the latest high court, after New York, Washington and New Jersey, to refuse to grant marriage rights to gay couples. What\u2019s your reaction to the decision? There haven\u2019t been many gay marriage gains recently.\nDS: Why is momentum in your movement seemingly stalled?\nDS: The decision was quite strong.\nDS: But the court ruled against even domestic partnerships.\nFreedom to Marry\u2019s role.\nDS: What role does Freedom to Marry play in these cases?\nDS: Were you an adviser and consultant to the plaintiffs in the Maryland case?\nDS: Does Freedom to Marry play more of a coordinating function?\nDS: How do you handle losses such as the one in Maryland?\nDomestic partnerships and civil unions.\nDS: Why are domestic partnerships or civil unions not adequate?\nDS: People like Alan Dershowitz have raised an argument that the word 'marriage' should be reserved for religious contexts, and in civil and legal contexts we should use a uniform concept of civil unions.\nDS: He\u2019s not arguing against marriage, but against marriage as a civil institution.\nDS: People argue that system is already broke. Half of marriages end in divorce. If that system isn\u2019t working for straights, why should we introduce it for gay people?\nTransgender people and marriage.\nDS: Transgender people face specific issues in marriage since what constitutes a man or a woman is often legally defined. How does the marriage movement address this issue?\nDS: Do you see the issues interrelated, or does winning the freedom to marry itself usurp any problems faced by intersexed or transgender people?"}

The base was completely destroyed. One of the soldiers killed in the attack was Senegalese, while the majority were Nigerian.

In addition, he said that while the AU was in the process of creating new emergency security plans, not much more could be done without an increase to the funds and troop levels of the bases in Darfur.

He was 105 years old.\nKeating, born on January 2, 1902 and raised in the townland of Ballygamboon, Castlemaine, County Kerry, received his education in local schools, including the Christian Brothers' School in Tralee. Tralee was also the place where Keating did his apprenticeship. During this time he became a skillful Gaelic football player in his native Kerry.\nKeating joined Fianna \u00c9ireann in 1918. In 1920, during the Irish War of Independence, he joined the Boherbee B Company, 3rd Battalion, 1st Kerry Brigade, Irish Republican Army. On 21 April 1921, Royal Irish Constabulary Constable Denis O\u2019 Loughlin was shot dead in Knightly public house in Tralee. Keating, Jimmy O\u2019Connor and Percy Hanafin were suspected of the killing, and were forced to go on the run. On 1 June Keating was involved in an ambush between Castlemaine and Milltown which claimed the lives of 5 RIC men. On 10 July, a day before the truce between the IRA and British forces, Keating\u2019s unit was involved in a gun battle with the British Army near Castleisland. This confrontation resulted in the deaths of four British soldiers and five IRA Volunteers.\nKeating opposed the 1921 Anglo-Irish Treaty and fought on the Republican side in the Irish Civil War. He was involved in operations in counties Kerry, Limerick, and Tipperary, before his column was arrested by Free State Forces. Keating spent seven months in Portlaoise Prison and the Curragh Prison before being released in March 1923.\nKeating remained an IRA member for a long time after the Civil War. He was arrested several times during the thirties on various charges. Keating was active in London during the 1939/1940 IRA bombing campaign.\nKeating subsequently returned to Dublin and worked as a barman in several public houses. He retired and returned to his native Ballygamboon, Kerry in 1978. To his death he refused to accept a state pension because he considered the 26-county Republic of Ireland an illegitimate state which usurped the 1916 Irish Republic. In 2002 he refused the state's standard \u20ac2,500 award to centenarians from president Mary McAleese. After former IRA gun-runner George Harrison died in November 2004, Keating became patron of Republican Sinn F\u00e9in."}

Duncan Hunter introduces bill to cut federal funding for Columbia University", "text": "On September 26, United States Representative Duncan Hunter (R-Calif.) introduced a bill to prohibit federal grants to Columbia University in response to Columbia's decision to allow Iran's President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to speak on campus. The legislative bill, titled \"Restore Patriotism to University Campuses Act\", states that \"[t]hrough their invitation, Columbia University provided a public, prestigious platform on United States soil from which on September 24, 2007, President Ahmadinejad spoke and defended his wide-ranging support for terrorist activities.\" The bill arrived at the House of Representatives within two days after the speaking engagement. \nA portion of the bill requests a denial of funds to the University, \"for permitting State terrorist access to campus.\" According to the Council of Foreign Relations in the United States, its country's State Department has called Iran, \"[the] most active state sponsor of terrorism.\" \nIran's parliament, in September this year, labelled the U.S. forces as terrorists.\nHunter, who is seeking the Republican Presidential nomination, argued in favor of the bill last week. \"If the left-wing leaders of academia will not support our troops, they, in the very least, should not support our adversaries,\" he said. \"By hosting President Ahmadinejad, Columbia University openly insulted the thousands of servicemen and women serving in Iraq, most of whom are direct targets of the munitions that he is sending across the Iraq-Iran border.\"\nPrior to Ahmedinejad's speech, U.S. President George W. Bush expressed a different view, saying that Columbia's invitation \"really speaks to the freedoms of the country.\" \"I'm not so sure I'd offer the same invitation, but nevertheless, it speaks volumes about the greatness, really, of America. We're confident enough to let a person express his views,\" he said."}

Vitter put the earmark into the labor, health and education financing bill for fiscal year 2008. The bill specifies the Louisiana Family Forum received the money \"to develop a plan to promote better science education.\" \nVitter has close ties to the LFF through Dan Richey, a former politician and the group's grass-roots coordinator, who received $17,250 as a consultant in Vitter's 2004 Senate race. Also Vitter's campaign paid Beryl Amedee who is the education resource council chairwoman for the Louisiana Family Forum. \nAs part of the Louisiana Family Forum efforts to \"combat\" the teaching of evolution, the group included Kent Hovind's \"Battle Plan\" on its website. Hovind, whose education from the non-accredited Patriot Bible University is widely considered to be a diploma mill, is currently serving a ten year prison sentence for tax evasion and obstructing federal agents.\nIn a written statement Vitter explained, \"This program helps supplement and support educators and school systems that would like to offer all of the explanations in the study of controversial science topics such as global warming and the life sciences.\" However, reporter James Gill poked fun at Vitter's admission of using the services of \"Pamela Martin and Associates\", a prostitution service ran by Deborah Jeane Palfrey, and his recent creationist earmark. \"We were better off when Vitter, in between homilies on the sanctity of marriage, was blowing his own money on prostitutes.

All miners have been rescued, and none of them were injured. The mine is owned by Harmony Gold Mining Corporation.\nThe mining company says that a lift electrical cable broke on a basket that was carrying miners, trapping thousands at least 2,200 meters (1.3 miles) below the earth's surface. Reports from \"MSNBC\" and the \"Guardian Unlimited\" say that the shaft may have collapsed when a water or air pipe burst. The rescue operation went well with no complications, with the rescue taking just under 24 hours to complete.\n\"They were underground when the accident happened and they were not able to surface because an electric feeder cable that is connected to the mine lift was severed,\" said a spokeswoman for the mining company, Amelia Soares. The snap was caused by a \"fatigued\" air pipe which burst and fell down the shaft damaging the \"steelwork and electrical feeder cords,\" added Soares. \"They are all in good condition.\"\n\"They are all safe. There have been no injuries or deaths,\" said CEO of Harmony mining, Graham Briggs who also said that the miners were previously contacted and were given \"food and water.\"\nEarlier reports had stated that Lesiba Seshoka, a spokesman with the National Union of Mineworkers, said that the miners have not been heard from for hours and that they could have been enduring temperatures as high as 105 degrees Fahrenheit (40 degrees Celsius).\n\"This is a terrible situation. The only exit is blocked, probably by a fall of ground,\" said Seshoka.\nRescue workers used a mine shaft that is next to the damaged one in an attempt to reach the trapped miners, and lifted them out, 75 at a time. There was no emergency exit in the shaft which is reported to have \"not been maintained for ages,\" added Seshoka.\n\"An escape route is the most important thing and they have failed miserably. They need to ensure that the shaft is maintained. This is why we have this disaster. Our main worry is for more than 3,000 people who are underground,\" said National Union of Mineworkers for S. Africa chairman, Deon Boqwana.\nCurrent reports say that \"negligence\" was the initial cause for the pipe burst and that there has been a history of negligence from the mine. \"We suspect negligence. Because of continuous operations there is no time to make adequate checks,\" said the President of the Miners union, Senzeni Zokwana to reporters during a news conference.\nThe Elsrand mine is currently under development and has been since February 2001 when Harmony bought the mine. Officials state that the mine will remain closed for a minimum of six weeks, while an investigation is performed, and the mine is deemed safe for miners to continue working in it.\nThe mine is located in the Witwatersrand Basin of South Africa, which is said to be the location of the largest area of raw gold on the planet."}
