He knows what turns you on and he knows whether it is a problem for you. Merlino, who is the psychiatry adviser to the \"New York Daily News\", is one of the more accomplished psychiatrists in his field and he is the Senior Editor of the forthcoming book, \"Freud at 150: 21st Century Essays on a Man of Genius\". The battle over interpreting Freud's legacy still rages, a testament to the father of psychoanalysis and his continuing impact today. \nOn the eve of the book's publication, \"Wikinews\" reporter went to the Upper East Side of Manhattan to discuss the past and future of Freud and psychoanalysis with Dr. Merlino, one of the preeminent modern psychoanalysts. Shankbone took the opportunity to ask about what insanity is, discuss aberrant urges, reflect upon sadomasochism (\"I'm not considered an expert in that field,\" laughed Dr. Merlino), and the hegemony of heterosexuality. \nDr. Merlino posits that absent structural, biochemical or physiological defects, insanity and pathology are relative and in flux with the changing culture of which you are a part. So it is possible to be sane and insane all in one day if, for instance, you are gay and fly from the United Kingdom to Saudi Arabia.\nWhat is normal and what is insane?\nDS: How do we know what is normal and what is insane?\nDS: And that would be considered insanity?\nDS: So insanity is always relative to a society?\nDS: So eccentricity would be a form of insanity in principle, relative to whatever society found it eccentric, since it is a violation of social norms and mores?\nDS: \u2014is 'pathological' better than 'insane' as a term?\nDS: So a woman who goes walking down the street naked in the middle of Manhattan, but fully cognizant of it and doing it to elicit a reaction, she has a pathology?\nDS: How often are people who are considered to have a mental disorder or pathology aware that their behavior is thought of as problematic by other people?\nDS: Such as a person who has an anger management problem? The problem isn't that they are brought to anger, it's the external influences. Even though that they know anger is not a preferable state to be in, they don't see themselves as the problem, even though they know that people get them there is a problem. In other words, my anger is not good, but the real problem is that you made me angry.\nHomosexuality and psychiatry.\nDS: The declassification of homosexuality as a mental disorder was a controversial debate in the psychiatric community, and it is still presented 30 years later as if it is this raging debate, and that it is just activism that was the impetus for change as opposed to any real hard science.\nDS: If the issue was presented today, would it be 58% still, or would it be a greater number that do not believe homosexuality is a mental illness?\nDS: But it still has credence?\nSigmund Freud.\n\"'DS: Did Judeo-Christian outlook infuse any of Freud's thinking, like it did Michel Foucalt in the \"The History of Sexuality\"? \nDS: \u2014but treated?\nDS: How did he discern whether a person's homosexuality was a problem with the person internally, or whether it was an external problem brought about by societal reaction to the individual?\nDS: Is his model of psychosexual development model outdated as to be useless, or is it still functioning?\nDS: How would psychoanalysis handle something like Obsessive-compulsive disorder? It seems like the treatments that have been most successful are behavioral-cognitive and SSRI therapy.\nGender identity and Heteronormativity.\nDS: How do you explain the exaggerated femininity of some gay men?\nDS: Chris Crocker, the YouTube celebrity known for his in-your-face femininity, perhaps falls in that category. \nDS: What is the process by which a person develops a gender?\nSadomasochism.\nDS: Do you think there are psychological distinctions between sadism and masochism in men?\nDS: Freud assumed sadism in men resulted from a distortion of an aggressive component of male sexual instinct, whereas masochism in men was seen as an aberration, completely contrary to the nature of male sexuality. Is that still a function of psychoanalysis?\nDS: What is the motivation behind S&amp;M? Pain for sexual pleasure? Gratification from cruelty? Pleasure from power and the absence thereof?\nDS: \u2014the missionary gets boring after awhile\u2014\n[\"A follow-up note from Dr. Merlino:\" The above discussion assumes S&amp;M is a consensual sexual relationship. The gamut of behavior can run from healthy and normal to disturbed and pathological. Clearly sadism in the context of the detached inflicting of pain on others based on the belief one has the right to do so and that others are there to be abused (e.g. rapists, batterers, etc) is pathological. Similarly, masochistic behavior rooted in depression or a self-defeating personality make-up is pathological.]\nParaphilias, urges and fetishes.\nDS: What constitutes a paraphiliac?\nDS: Can a person be a paraphiliac and not have it be a problem?\nDS: When would cross-dressing become a disorder? \nDS: So pathology is almost always defined in relation to your interaction with the outside world? If I lived on an island I could just do anything I wanted and nothing would be a pathology because I am a person unto myself and it doesn't affect anyone else?\nDS: What about autoerotic asphyxiation where a person engages in that activity that can be highly dangerous\u2014fatal\u2014yet they don't believe it? Is it a 'smoker's denial'? \nDS: With obsessions such as paraphilias, a person presents things to themselves in a series of questions. What if I'm really gay? What if I really want to seduce my patient? What if I really was aroused by a picture of that child? If someone comes to you and says, 'I just can't get out of my head the thought that I want to kill my baby', how do you handle such a challenging problem?\nDS: The difference is between having a thought occur, and actually acting it out in one's head? It's \"I thought about wanting to kill my baby,\" versus, \"I'm picturing drowning my baby in the bathtub almost every night I wash her.\"\n\"'DS: I have a personal example that makes me laugh. There is a 60-year-old woman at work named Barbara who I have never met, but to whom I have spoken on the phone. I don't know many Barbaras, but I remember the opening scene of \"Night of the Living Dead\" where the brother and sister are in the cemetery and to give the sister, Barbara, a scare, the brother starts going, \"Baahbarah, Baaahbarah, they are coming to get you, Barbara.\" It makes me laugh to imagine a scenario of calling this 60-year-old Barbara at work and saying that into the phone. I have acted this out many, many times with my office mates, and it makes us laugh. It's making me laugh now, the thought of doing something that bizarre\u2014 \nDS: Behind it is the idea...I would never...\nDS: No, she's just another co-worker, who I've never even met. We've just spoken on the phone once. She has a kind voice. But I have acted this out in my head often, as a way to give myself a chuckle. To actually do it would be mortifying. It might scare her and I wouldn't want to do that.\nDS: [\"Laughs\"] But would that be a pathology, that I've acted this harassing phone call out in my head? And if it's not a problem, is it because the act is relatively harmless, as opposed to wanting to drown my baby?\nDS: Such as, why do I find violating a social norm or more amusing?\n\"'DS: Is there always a connection? For instance, just that opening of the movie sticks in my head and I don't meet many Barbaras. It was just something that popped into my head, synapses fired. And that movie \"did\" play a role in my life, trust me. But would it always signify something deeper than that?\nCultural psychology in the United States today.\nDS: Have you noticed any affect that the current political culture has had on your patients, in terms of the Iraq War? Either in pathologies where the war is manifesting itself, or in just a general discomfort with the state of the culture and society as it is?\nDS: What do you mean when you say 'doing anything about it'?\nDS: We have been in this war for four years. Is it important to discuss it?\nDS: Do you think people are putting their heads in the sand, or do you think it is too much for people to process what is happening?\nDS: But we respond to it.\nDS: How do you think that affects personality development, that our interactions today are so two-dimensional?\nDS: It seems a lot of pathology comes from people being isolated, living in their own heads and coming up with their own theories absent the interaction of other people. They develop entire systems of beliefs and what they think motivates other people.\nDS: But it's not going to go back. It's here to stay.\n*About Joseph Merlino.\nDr. Joseph Merlino is Director of Psychiatry and Behavioral Health at Queens Hospital Center.

The new discovery was made by NASA's Spitzer Space telescope.\nAccording to scientists, dust and rock orbiting a ten million year old star in the system HD 113766 contains \"enough [material] to build a Mars-size planet or larger.\"\n\"The timing for this system to be building an Earth is very good. If the system was too young, its planet-forming disk would be full of gas, and it would be making gas-giant planets like Jupiter instead. If the system was too old, then dust aggregation or clumping would have already occurred and all the system's rocky planets would have already formed,\" said NASA scientist Carey Lisse from the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory located in Baltimore, Maryland.\nLisse states that the dust and rock, which was examined by the telescopes infrared spectrometer instrument, is more processed than the snowball-like stuff that makes up infant solar systems and comets, which are considered cosmic \"refrigerators\" because they contain pristine ingredients from the early solar system, but he also says that the material is not quite ready to form an actual planet, meaning that the material is currently in a \"transitional phase\" or in a phase just before a planet begins to form.\nThe dusty material Lisse says, does not contain \"any water ice, carbonates, or fragile organic materials,\" making the star system a fairly young celestial body.\n\"The material mix in this belt is most reminiscent of the stuff found in lava flows on Earth. I thought of Mauna Kea material when I first saw the dust composition in this system - it contains raw rock and is abundant in iron sulfides, which are similar to fool's gold,\" said Lisse. Mauna Kea is a well-known volcano in Hawaii.\nScientists remain excited knowing that they have the chance to observe a planet forming right before their eyes. \"It is fantastic to think we are able to detect the process of terrestrial planet formation. Stay tuned - I expect lots more fireworks as the planet in HD113766 grows,\" added Lisse."}

When Field is charged, he will face 15 charges relating to bribery and corruption.\nJudge Justice Tony Randerson said in his ruling that it was within the public interest to see the \"extremely serious\" charges laid against the independent MP. Justice Randerson said that the allegations made, \"strike at the heart of the administration of government and the integrity of members of Parliament.\"\nWork, worth around NZ$10,000, was undertaken on seven houses the MP owns in Auckland, Wellington, Tonga and Samoa by Thais. In return, Field helped them with immigration applications into New Zealand. Justice Randerson said, \"There is no question that the respondent undertook immigration work for the named individuals and that they carried out painting, plastering and tiling work for the respondent on the various properties.\"\nThe trial will focus around two aspects. Firstly, whether the work carried out was undervalued and secondly, if work was being done in return for immigration assistance via a corrupt arrangement and was treated as such.\nIf convicted, Field will face a maximum sentence of seven years in jail under Section 103 of the Crimes Act 1961.\nThis ruling sets a precedent in New Zealand as Field is the first MP to face these types of charges. In June, there was a court hearing to argue if charges were to be laid against the former Labour MP by the Crown. In June, Crown Prosecutor Simon Moore said, \"The rational for a High Court judge being involved in the exercise appears to be based on the need to avoid the appearance of a ministerial or political interference in making a prosecutorial decision.\"\nAt the same June court hearing, Field said he was innocent of all allegations. \"I have nothing to hide. I am innocent and it is best that I front up.\"\nWhen the allegations first surfaced, Phillip Field was a sitting Labour MP. He resigned from the party in February and returned to Parliament as an independent.\nThe ruling will be appealed by Field's lawyers."}

He often corresponds with his readers and his public functions are a mix of parties, nightclubs, academic lectures, university panels and film premieres. \nHe is friendly and frank, and he welcomes people to join him in his world (\"I just got a message that Michael Lucas died!\" he says staring wide-eyed at his phone; the message turned out to be false). \"Wikinews\" reporter spoke with Musto about his life and his relationship to the world of celebrity journalism.

Recently, Cindy Adams wrote in her column a blurb about something Alan Greenspan said, and then she said something to the effect of, 'and I'd mention the name of his book if he had told me that to me first,' as if Greenspan is going to go run to Cindy Adams just to get a book mention in her column.

How do you criticize, yet live off of that world?\nDS: Were you ever part of that world?\n\"'DS: [\"Laughs\"] \u2014you look a little hung today\u2014\n\"'DS: You recently did a column that opened talking about how gays don't want to bottom anymore; later you talk about Michael Moore's \"Sicko\" and the problem of hospitals over-medicating their patients. Do you think that style of mixing glitz and substance reaches people, or do you think they tend to gloss the substantive parts?\nDS: It seems to be because it's a reaction of a community to a health related topic, since you were saying it was a health consciousness that is causing a dearth of bottoms. Bare-backing is still the rage.\nOn outing gay celebrities.\nDS: What stands out as a story that you did where you were bowled over by the reaction to it.\nDS: \u2014You outed Rosie O'Donnell and Ellen Degeneres\u2014\nDS: Do you have a theory or philosophy you follow about outing?\nDS: What about the argument that it is more appropriate for people who are working against the gay community, a Larry Craig, if you will?\nDS: There are a lot of gay people who aren't talked about in Hollywood now. Merv Griffin was an example. Do you not feel the need to spell it out for some people who lead very openly gay lives but that nobody talks about?\nDS: But why not write something before he died?\nDS: Did you ever come under editorial pressure over those?\nDS: You are pretty accessible to your readers as well, right?\nOn New York City.\nDS: Where do you see Manhattan's culture going?\nDS: Do you miss the old New York?\n\"'DS: A friend of mine said that if you transplanted someone from 1983 New York into 2007 New York they would be \"shocked\" by how many people there are walking around; they would be like, 'Where did all these people come from?!' People don't realize that there were a lot of empty streets back then.\nDS: How do you define freaky?\nDS: Do you think drugs makes for a fun party scene?\nDS:' So the people you are hanging out with who are swinging from the chandeliers, they are just naturally that way?\nMusto on Musto.\nDS: How would you choose your own death?\nDS: What's a lesson your father taught you?\nDS: It's so true, isn't it?\nDS: Has the Iraq War affected your writing at all?\nDS: Has if affected your world view?\nDS: Hillary or Barack?\nDS: Who would be your dream candidate?\nDS: By magic microphone you have to talk to Osama bin Laden, but you can't apprehend him.

Since the September 11, 2001 attacks the United States has increased by a factor of over 40 the funding for research related to potential biological weapons as well as other virulent infectious diseases, such as Anthrax, Ebola and Smallpox. Since 2003, there have been at least 100 incidents involving United States laboratories. These incidents have ranged from missing shipments of deadly viruses and bacteria to accidents in which lab workers have become infected. According to the Congressional panel even where research is going on is not precisely known. \nThe recent investigations were prompted in part by the suspension of research at Texas A&amp;M University after repeated laboratory accidents and failure to report serious breaches to the Center for Disease Control including an incident in which someone was infected with brucellosis, a disease which can infect humans and a variety of domesticated animals and is generally not fatal in humans. Concern about safety and security procedures focus primarily on two risks: terrorists obtaining biological agents from laboratories or labs accidentally releasing infectious agents into the general population.\nCritics have questioned the influx of new research as being unnecessary, unguided and dangerous both to workers and to the people around them and have pointed to the case of Janet Parker who was the last recorded case of someone dying from smallpox and had contracted the disease by working in a building with poor containment systems.

Of the plane's crew, only the Congolese flight engineer survived the accident.\nThe Congolese air safety record is one of the worst in the world, and this is the latest and deadliest in a string of recent aviation accidents and incidents. According to presidential spokesman Kudura Kasongo, the reason behind the sacking of transport minister Remy Henri Kuseyo Gatanga is \"for being incapable of organising the aviation sector\".\nTransport Minister R\u00e9my Kuseyo had previously said the aircraft should never have taken off due to a ban imposed three weeks ago on the use of Antonov aircraft in the country due to safety concerns. He feels his dismissal is unjust, saying \"Measures had been taken... \"I had taken measures, but I am not the one who was to have put the measures in place on the ground.\"\nSaleh Kinyongo of the Humanitarian Affairs Ministry revised previous information that the entire flight crew had been killed, saying to reporters \"We now know there is a survivor in hospital. He's the mechanic (of the plane)... He's alive and well. He's talking and he's even been on TV.\" His name was given as Dede Ngama and he is receiving treatment at the Roi Baudouin hospital in Kinshasa. Previously, Russia's foreign ministry had reported that all three of the flight crew were Russian nationals and were killed in the crash. This has, however, been confirmed as accurate for the pilot and co-pilot.\nIt is known that shortly after takeoff, the plane experienced technical difficulties and initiated fuel dumping, then contacted air traffic control to request an emergency landing. Aircraft often dump fuel prior to emergency landings shortly after takeoff, as the aircraft are too heavy to land safely with full fuel loads. However, after about ten minutes, the plane suddenly plunged down into a market and houses in a residential area. The Russian Foreign ministry reported that upon takeoff the plane lost a propeller, and that a wing sheared off when the plane impacted a bank of trees.\nAn emergency meeting of Congo's cabinet was held yesterday to investigate how existing air safety regulations could be improved, including possibilities of better inspections and tougher penalties for non-conformers.\nThe crash site has proved difficult to secure from onlookers and petty criminals. Local police have already arrested several people attempting to steal scrap metal, engine parts and any other valuables from the fire-scorched wreckage.\nThe crash has provoked national outrage, with local newspapers using headlines such as \"Another flying coffin kills again,\" and \"Congo's killer skies,\". The government had promised to improve poor safety standards.\nThe plane belonged to Africa One, but had been leased to Manilla Airlift. The aircraft had undergone a safety inspection prior to it's departure from nearby Ndjili international airport.\nThe International Air Transport Association has described Congo's aviation safety record as 'an embarrassment', while all Congolese airlines except Hewa Bora Airways are on the List of air carriers banned in the EU.\nSources.\n "}

The university staff worried that \"Roberts risked the non-profit status of the university by insisting\" students work as volunteers for Miller's mayoral campaign. In May 2006, after the IRS contacted ORU about its involvement Miller's campaign, Brooker said he told to \"fall on the sword\" while taking \"full and total blame.\" This would have required covering up the directives made by Roberts. Days after the three professors brought this to the attention of the school, they were fired by Stephanie Cantese, Richard Robert's sister-in-law.

The items, which were beneficial to the Roberts family was not recovered and though Richard was confronted he took no action.\nThe lawsuit also claims Paulita Brooker, Tim's wife, \"was fired partly because Swails had reported that Vice Provost [Jeff Ogle] sexually harassed another professor\" and took no action regarding the sexual harassment.\nResponses.\nJohn Hagee, a ORU Board of Regents member, said the university's executive board \"is conducting a full and thorough investigation.\" The lawsuit alleges \"members of the Board of Regents are painfully aware- have omitted from this Petition to preserve, as much as possible, the remaining image of the University.\" Furthermore, the court filing quoted Roberts as saying \"if a Regent appears to give me trouble, I remove him. I stack the deck. . .\"\nOn Wednesday Roberts said, \"This suit has been filed by an attorney who has over the years filed many suits against Oral Roberts University . . .

The report says that on September 16, four Blackwater vehicles and two helicopters opened fire without provocation in Nisoor square, following a car bombing near a meeting involving a USAID official under Blackwater protection. The report says that at least 14 Iraqi civilians were killed in Nisoor square, and that two or three more were killed at a nearby intersection. \nThe U.S. normally makes compensation payments to the families of civilians killed in battle, but at amounts far lower than the $8 million per family demanded in the report.

However, the report argues that Blackwater's license to operate in Iraq expired in 2006, and thus it is no longer immune from prosecution under the 2004 law.\nAlthough Blackwater has not yet responded to the Iraqi report, it has previously stated that its employees were acting in self-defense in the Nisoor square incident.

While metal detectors were present in the building, they were not always in use; it is unclear whether they were in use at the time of the shooting.\nThe school, SuccessTech Academy, is a non-traditional school within the Cleveland Metropolitan School District, described on their web site as a \"small, nontraditional high school that provides a learning environment in which all student believe in their ability to succeed.\" It opened five years ago.\nSuccessTech is located on the third, fourth and fifth floors of a building in downtown Cleveland that also houses some administrative offices.\nThe school owes its existence in part to a grant from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which helped to fund the creation of the school."}

The reason given for giving the prestigious award to Doris Lessing was to honour \"that epicist of the female experience, who with skepticism, fire and visionary power has subjected a divided civilisation to scrutiny\". \nLessing herself, who will turn 88 on October 22, has been named a potential candidate over the last 30 years - so long in fact, that she herself once exclaimed: \"I'll never get it\".

He had just flown back from Colombia and he was cranky. \"I'm happy to do an interview with you,\" he said, \"but what the hell could you ask me that's not already out there? Have you even bothered to look?!\u201d \n\"Jeez, Mr. Talese, lots of things,\" was my response. I lied. The truth is that when I call people to interview them, I do not have a set of preconceived questions. My agenda is to talk to them and gain a sense of who they are; to flesh them out as humans. To find out what they think about the world around them at that moment. With Gay Talese I had little interest in talking about \"Frank Sinatra Has a Cold\" and with Augusten Burroughs I had little interest in discussing \"Running with Scissors\". I want to know what they think about things outside of the boxes people have placed them in.\nWith a memoirist like Burroughs, even this is a challenge. What parts of his life he has not written about himself, other interviewers have strip-mined. When we met for dinner at Lavagna in the East Village, I explained to Augusten this issue. I suggested we make the interview more of a conversation to see if that would be more interesting. \"Instead of you in the catbird seat,\" I said, \"let's just talk.\" \nWe struck an instant rapport. What set out to be an hour and half interview over dinner had turned into four hours of discussion about our lives similarly lived. I removed half of the interview: the half that focused on me.\nBelow is \"Wikinews\" reporter \u2019s conversation with writer Augusten Burroughs.\nOn addiction and getting sober.\nDavid Shankbone: It's difficult to be creative and innovative. When you come up with an idea and then come across a place where it has already been done, how do you overcome disenchantment that can ruin your inspiration?\nDS: You started drinking when you were 13, but 16 was when you were really--\nDS: How did you get over the problems of dating? Just by being sober-?\nDS: Which is what one tends to do.\nDS: As happens.\nDS: I know that feeling.\nDS: You saw all this, but how long did it take before you started saying, 'I need to stop'?\nDS: Gin blossoms kind of stuff.\n[food arrives]\nDS: You were proud of it.\nDS: That accomplishment is so difficult.\nDS: That gives you some amount of respect for people who write a book of crap, but yet write a book.\nDS: It\u2019s like, you can have the talent, but if you don't have that discipline to actually carry it through, the talent's wasted.\nDS: How did you get the discipline?\nDS: You were sober at the time?\nDS: And you couldn't have probably done all this without being sober.\nOn the Turcottes and his mother.\n\"'DS: Did you read the \"Vanity Fair\" interview with the Turcottes?\nDS: You just don't have an interest?\nDS: A debate that is not a debate.\nDS: It's like Holocaust denial.\nDS: Do you think the memoirist has a responsibility to inform people that they're writing about that they're writing about them?\nDS: Although you could with this.\nDS: Did you listen to the NPR interview with your mom?\nDS: She's still in that \u2018I\u2019m Anne Sexton\u2019 thinking?\nDS: It\u2019s ironic that the notoriety she's received has been via you; do you think that in some ways she likes it?\nDS: There's no such thing as bad publicity.\nDS: Make that time.\nDS: Intellectually, that\u2019s nice, but I mean, in the end --\nDS: -- it's still your experience too, and what you went through. It's almost like someone who pleads the insanity defense. You can't really blame them. But they still killed your mom, raped your sister or whatever.\nDS: She takes credit for your writing career.\nDS: Does that bother you at all?\nDS: Elizabeth Berg writes a lot about parental and domestic relationships. Do you think that you're dealing with latent issues with your mom through your love of Berg?\n\"'DS: In the \"Vanity Fair\" article Teresa said that she had come down to New York to visit you with her kids--\nDS: And that you were saying that you want to marry her, how great she is, what a kind person she is\u2026\nDS: She's really going to be there with you.\nDS: Do you think that's what it was, the motivation?\nDS: They got what they wanted apparently from settling with Sony?\nDS: Setting the record straight?\nDS: Yeah.\nOn his work.\nDS: Do you read reviews of your work, and commentary on it?\nDS: Did it ever bother you if you came across somebody using the Twelve Steps in a review of your work?\nDS: I mean comparing the things you did with your writing and comparing them to how they conform to the principles in the Twelve Steps. It happened with Frey too, where all of a sudden you had these alcoholics coming out and saying, \"Oh, this is such a typical alcoholic, doing this or doing that. It\u2019s not very Step Eight,\u201d or whatever\u2026 You never came across that?\nDS: Do you still feel that way? \nDS: That's the \u2018nothing\u2019s original\u2019 thing, isn't it?\nDS: Do you know anyone who is?\nOn the response to his work from addicts.\nDS: How does it feel to be a hero to addicts?\nDS: You replaced it with writing?\nDS: Have you ever had an alcoholic write you and ask you to be their sponsor?\nDS: When people write to you, and they say they relate to your work, what element do they say they responded to--your upbringing, your relationship with your mother, your contending with alcoholism? You write on such a variety of topics--\nDS: Is there a theme that seems to resonate most with people in your life?\nDS: George W. Bush?\nOn belief in a higher power.\nDS: Do you believe in a higher power?\nDS: Did you ever come close to believing?\nDS: Through a program?\nDS: Did it feel false to you?\n[\"dishes are removed from table\"]\nDS: Which I think a lot of people do.\nDS: 'Fake it 'til you make it.'\nDS: What was your higher power, then?\n\"'DS: [\"chuckles\"]\nDS: Sounds like something--that it would be great if one of your fans drew for you.\n\"'DS: [\"chuckles\"]\nDS: A swarm of cows and cartoon Jesuses. You\u2019ll have to start a collection.\nDS: When did you lose it, though? When did you lose the belief in the higher power?\nDS: I meant more so in recovery, when you said to yourself, \u2018I'm just not getting the higher power thing\u2019, or, \u2018I just have to give up on the cartoon Jesus.\u2019\nDS: Once you were stronger.\nDS: It's a very small thought.\nOn the gay community.\nDS: What are your feelings about the gay community? Do you feel part of it?\n[\"Waiter stops by\"]\nDS: You had bigger issues to--\nDS: I always found the idea of pride--I mean, I understand the genesis of it.\nDS: I do understand where it came from. But now when I hear it, it sounds like such an anachronism. It's like--\nDS: \"I proudly serve Starbucks coffee.\" The word \"pride\" is so bandied about in so many venues, and it's like, what do you mean, you \u201cproudly\u201d serve Starbucks coffee? What do you mean that you're \u201cproud\u201d about being gay, or --\nDS: You accepted yourself--\nDS: Yeah. I can understand that.\n\"'DS: [\"Laughs\"] That's great\u2026\nOn his new book, \"A Wolf at the Table\", a memoir about his father.\nDS: How did you teach yourself to write about difficult things in your life with such humor?\nDS: But originally you didn't, right? I heard an interview where you said you started writing something and you were like, 'Oh, God, this is just so depressing'--\n\"'DS: And then you put it away, and decided that you were going to write something funny, which I think was \"Sellevision\"?\nDS: Did you make a choice--\nDS: Why was the choice made?\nDS: Did you try to write it funny at first?\nDS: 'Oh, another Burroughs!'\nDS: No.\nDS: But also, too, your fans should realize that you're not one-dimensional.\nDS: With your writing, that you don't have a--\nDS: It's like, \"Oh, we wanna see Data from 'Star Trek' be Data; we don't want to see him in his full range of emotions,\" you know--\nDS: Versatile.\nDS: Why do you think you are so serious in person?\nDS: Is it like a purpose-ness? That you're very purpose-driven now, or--?\nDS: Do you and Dennis yuk it up at home?\nDS: How can anyone--\nOn women's breasts and tattoos.\nDS: What's your favorite curse word?\n\"'DS: [\"Chuckles\"] That's always the one that--\n\"'DS: It \"does.\"\nDS: It\u2019s a cutting word. Do you have a favorite euphemism for women's breasts?\n\"'DS: [\"Chuckles\"] What would you name your breasts?\nDS: Would Claire be the bigger one? \n\"'DS: [\"Laughs\"] Really?\nDS: You're not like most gay men who have a fascination with breasts?\nDS: Do you like them on other people?\nDS: Do you have a breast fetish?\nDS: My sister has stretch marks on her stomach that she's really self-conscious about--\nDS: We've been talking about that!\nDS: I had suggested to her tattooing a band of stars across it, that--\nDS: Yeah, like where it starts out small, and goes like bigger over the marks?\nDS: And she was all for it. We were going to take her to my tattoo guy, over here on First Avenue--\n\"'DS: And she all of a sudden has been like, \"Mmmmm, I don't really know.\" And she's like, \"Maybe I'm going to get a belly button ring.\" But that's going to \"highlight\" it! \nDS: No! So--\n\"'DS: [\"Laughs\"] I should--it would only take one drink with her.\nOn losing his hair.\nDS: Was it difficult losing your hair?\nDS: It's really hard.\nDS: I freaked out on my mom one time because she made a joke about it. I went overboard, I just freaked out. This was years ago, when it was just first starting to go a little bit. But I also always had a high peak, always.\nDS: As a matter of fact, people made fun of me about it in my Georgia high school.\n\"'DS: Yeah. [\"In a southern accent\"] \"Sportin' a pretty big forehead, there, Day-vid.\"\nDS: I freaked out. \"You don't know what it's like! You don't have any idea!\u201d It was Christmas. But a person has to get to a point where he accepts it.\nDS: Like when you see guys who try all these creative styles to--\nDS: You know, pushing all their hair forward, when it's really--\nDS: You know, and you think--\nDS: Let it go. It makes it seem like they have trouble dealing with things.\nDS: There's wider implications.\nDS: Or reflection of psychological issues.\nDS: Yeah. You look very nice, without\u2026\nDS: Yeah, yeah.\nDS: Like a hat.\nDS: Wouldn't it be great if you were Jewish, and you could have a yarmulke with a hairpiece underneath it?\nDS: Or, or you wore a hairpiece as a yarmulke.\nDS: But you have one of those really great heads that are conducive to having a shaved head. Like sometimes you see guys, and you're like, \"Oh, you don't really have the head for having a shaved head,\" you know?\nDS: Misshapen heads\u2026\nDS: Thank you, thank God. I was told that by my sister, and I was like, \"Oh, thank God,\" And she\u2019s very honest with me.\nDS: And I said, \"Thank God,\" because I don't really have a choice?\nDS: Well, this is why I also do the scruff here, because I'm losing my hair. It's completely like\u2026\nDS: I used to think that beards were a form of male self-mutilation. Now, if I don\u2019t do it I feel like I look like Norman Mailer or something. \nDS: Do you have nightmares?"}

The Turkish government has warned that the resolution threatens its strategic partnership with the U.S.\nThe resolution, passed 27-21 by the U.S. House Committee on Foreign Affairs on Wednesday, states that \"[t]he Armenian Genocide was conceived and carried out by the Ottoman Empire from 1915 to 1923, resulting in the deportation of nearly 2,000,000 Armenians, of whom 1,500,000 men, women, and children were killed\". The resolution calls on the President \" to ensure that the foreign policy of the United States reflects appropriate understanding and sensitivity concerning issues related to human rights, ethnic cleansing, and genocide documented in the United States record relating to the Armenian Genocide.\" \nThe World War I era killings, commonly referred to as the Armenian Genocide, have been recognized as genocide by 22 countries, including France, Russia, Venezuela, Argentina, and Canada. The killings have also been officially labeled as \"genocide\" by 40 of the 50 U.S. states. Turkey acknowledges that Armenians were killed, but calls it a massacre rather than an organized campaign of genocide.\nOn Thursday the Turkish government released a statement saying that \"It is unacceptable that the Turkish nation should be accused of a crime that it never committed in its history.\" \"We still hope that the House of Representatives will have enough good sense not to take this resolution further,\" the statement added. A statement on the Turkish Foreign Ministry web site said that the resolution \"will not only endanger relations with a friendly and allied nation but will also jeopardize a strategic partnership that has been cultivated for generations.\" \nOn Thursday, Turkey recalled its U.S. ambassador Nabi Sensoy, and warned of further repercussions. \"Yesterday some in Congress wanted to play hardball,\" said Turkish foreign policy adviser Egemen Bagis. \"I can assure you Turkey knows how to play hardball.\"\nWhite House spokesman Scott Stanzel said he was \"disappointed\" by the vote. While acknowledging that \"[w]e understand the feelings that people have about the tragic suffering of the Armenian people,\" Stanzel warned that \"Turkey is playing a critical role in the war on terror and this action is problematic for everything we're trying to do in the Middle East and would cause great harm to our efforts.\" U.S. President George W. Bush had lobbied against the resolution, saying that it would damage relations between the U.S. and Turkey.\nHouse of Representatives speaker Nancy Pelosi said the resolution will go forward for a vote in the House despite Turkish opposition. \"As long as there is genocide, there is a need to speak out against it,\" Pelosi said."}

The military escalation is a great source of concern...Haven't we seen enough violence and hopelessness? Don't we see what is happening to the social fabric of Darfur ... torn apart completely -- is this what we want to perpetuate?\"\nEliasson also warned that any delay in the negotiations would be detrimental in stopping the violence in the region. Despite protests from rebel leaders, he pleaded for affiliates from all of the numerous rebel groups to attend the peace talks, currently scheduled for October 27th in Libya. Mark Malloch Brown, Britain's Minister for Africa, said Wednesday that rebel groups who do not participate in the peace talks will not benefit from any possible ceasefire deals. \n\"Anybody who wants to be a legitimate representative of the Darfuri people needs to go,\" Lord Malloch Brown said. \n\"If they opt out, they should understand the consequences of doing that - probably their role in the peace negotiations may be finished.\" \nThese comments came on the same day that forces believed to be from the Sudanese government and janjaweed militias attacked a fortification in Muhajiriya of the Sudanese Liberation Army (SLA), the only rebel group to co-sign a 2006 peace agreement with the Sudanese government. At least 40 people were killed in the attack. \n\"Until now the number of dead civilians are at least 40, with 80 missing and a large number of injured,\" the SLA said in a statement sent to Reuters. They believe that Sudan's army was responsible for the attack, although the government has refuted this accusation.\n\"There has to be an international investigation immediately,\" said Minni Arcua Minnawi, an SLA leader who became a presidential advisor in Khartoum. Speculation is rampant about the motivations for the attack, although analysts in Nairobi claim that the rebel movement and the government were barely allies even after the signing of the peace pact.\nAnother crisis in the peace process occurred Thursday when the main southern political party pulled out of the government due to Khartoum's inability to share power. Former rebels from the Sudan People's Liberation Movement (SPLM) withdrew from the national government after the escalation of violence against rebels.\nAdding even more to the uncertainty leading up to the peace talks, UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said in a report that Khartoum was delaying the deployment of the African Union-UN hybrid peacekeeping force.\n\"The implementation timeline for UNAMID is being delayed owing to ... delays in obtaining feedback regarding the list of troop-contributing countries submitted to the government of Sudan,\" said the Secretary General's report.\n\"I remain extremely concerned about the continuing violence in Darfur. The ongoing loss of life and displacement of civilians is unacceptable and is not contributing to an atmosphere conducive to peace talks.\" \nThough these events have put the peace talks at risk, all involved know that the success of the talks is critical for the well-being of the region. As Eliasson said, \"To miss this opportunity is a tragedy -- this is the moment of truth,\". "}

However, there is a to make corn ethanol uses more energy than the ethanol itself produces. \nBelow is David Shankbone's interview with Senator Sam Brownback.\nOn running in and possibly leaving the Presidential race.\nDavid Shankbone: Senator Brownback, how are you?\nDS: I read that.\nDS: Is it pretty gratifying for you to work with people on the other side of the aisle to try and find solutions?\nDS: I remember sort of the old days where you'd hear about being best friends with ; do you think that the period ushered in an era where people were too opposed to each other on the sides of the aisle?\nDS: Running for President has to be a grueling experience, and there must be a million things that you see out there when you're on the road that either you had not thought about before or you didn't know existed. Could you tell me about one?\nDS: That's great. Throughout my life, my father, who is an avid lifelong Republican, he used to tell me--this is a question that I'd asked Tom Tancredo as well, but I think it really comes down to one of the central issues in this race--he had said, \"All we need is a Republican Congress, a Republican Senate, and a Republican White House to get the country on the right track.\" And last year, he expressed to me that he was very disappointed with where things have gone with the Republicans running things. He feels let down; he feels like he was lied to by the Party, either through the rationale for the Iraq war, the sex and bribery scandals, the pork barrel projects, and, as said, the fiscal irresponsibility. He feels like there have been many broken promises. Why should someone like my father vote Republican today? And I can assure you he will. But why do you think he should?\nDS: When you think about dropping out of the race, what emotions do you feel?\nDS: You've discussed it, and I'm just wondering when it's a thought that occurs to you-- not an inevitability---just when you think about it as a possibility, how do you feel when you reflect upon it?\nDS: Do you feel sad when you think about possibly leaving?\nOn the role of religion in the Presidential race.\nDS: candidates haven't fared particularly well in this primary season. What do you think is the reason for that?\nDS: The Democrats often have concerns about the electability of their candidates; , for example. Do you think that it might scare some people that in this point in time that Evangelicals aren't particularly electable?\nDS: Do you think 's is an issue that people should take into consideration?\nDS: What if someone was a ?\nDS: Or a .\nDS: Really?\nDS: Even though religious beliefs are so fundamental to a person? It's more of a policy issue than it is a faith issue?\nDS: If someone told you that they were scared to vote for someone who doesn't believe in , what would you say to that person?\nDS: You don\u2019t think that evolution is incompatible with an theory? That we could have evolved based upon the evolution idea, but that it could have still been the work of God?\nDS: What's your personal belief on that?\nDS: It works.\nOn the culture of life.\nDS: What do you think is the greatest threat to humanity?\nDS: What is the ? How would you describe that phrase?\nDS: Bobby Schindler, 's brother, endorsed your candidacy by saying that \"Sam Brownback is the pro-life conservative we can trust to stand for all life, regardless of political calculations.\" Do you think the detracts from the culture of life?\nOn the Iraq War and the Middle East.\nDS: A common question I've asked in my interviews is about the Iraq War and how it has affected someone as a person. People often proffer their opinion on the war, but they don't really talk much about how it has affected them personally, perhaps in their world view. The writer insisted the war has not affected him at all. \"I wish it had,\" he said. Talese thinks there's a problem with Americans not sacrificing enough, and he argued that we need . Do you think we need conscription, if not to support the manpower of the war, to make Americans more involved with the wars that we are fighting?\nDS: What you think the proper role of Congress is in a time of war?\nDS: Do you feel the American people were misled with the war in Iraq?\nDS: What do you think is going to happen to Egypt after Mubarak?\nDS: Do you think it's a bad idea to have elections in countries if it's possible that an will win, such as happened in Palestine with ?\nDS: Do you think that things like the are projects that shouldn't be funded? And I'm using that popular phrase--I realize it's a little emotionally charged--but things such as that.\nDS: You support the that would essentially allow Israel to keep the entire West Bank while taking little responsibility for its Arab residents. The plan is against U.S., Israeli, Jordanian and Palestinian policies. Why do you think that would advance peace in the Middle East?\nOn gay rights.\nDS: I interviewed the writer Augusten Burroughs. I would like you to answer a question that he posed. He said that \"God does not care that the person I watch TV with also has hairy arms, that the idea that a God would not like homosexuals is patently absurd, that it doesn't even begin to become logical in any way, that the idea that the architect of gravity, the being that created the ability for elemental particles that are absolutely nothing to come together and create living organisms and bricks and buildings and cars and jets, that the architect of absolutely everything would care about the sex of the person that this little human loves seems ridiculous.\" Why is that not ridiculous?\nDS: Why do you think it would bother God that somebody is gay?\nDS: In what country that has passed same-sex marriage has traditional marriage declined?\nDS: Got you.\nDS: Why did you vote against the Federal expansion of hate crimes to include sexual orientation?\nDS: Ministers speaking out against homosexuality would come under the province of a hate crime?\nBrownback on Brownback.\nDS: If you could choose your manner of , how would you die?\nDS: It's a question.\nDS: But you've never thought about how--if you could choose how you'd prefer to die?\nDS: It seems like such a basic human thing to contemplate, one's mortality. I mean, I believe you, but--\nDS: What weren't you happy with?\nDS: That was your--\nDS: Was that your impetus to run for the Senate?\nDS: What trait do you deplore in other people?\nDS: Oh...\nOn environmentalism and energy.\nDS: Do you believe that a good Christian should also be a good environmentalist?\nDS: How so?\nDS: And you don\u2019t think that Arctic drilling contradicts that notion?\nDS: What about ?\nDS: Do you think we should lower tariffs on sugar in order to be able to import more Brazilian sugar ethanol?\nDS: But it would reduce our dependency on foreign oil, thus increasing our national security, wouldn't it? Or is the ethanol industry here more important?\nDS: But the energy that you derive from that .\nOn Wikipedia.\nDS: Senator, do you think that is important?\nDS: Definitely. What do you find important about it?\nDS: I tried to get an interview with of the , and I spoke to their Director of Public Relations; I had about a twenty-minute phone call with him, and he was very hostile to it. One of the things that I'd said to him--because he was saying that a lot of information is incorrect--I made the point to him that, \"You know, it may be incorrect, but the idea is that you can have Scientologists go on there to correct it.\" It's not a one-sided place for information; if you feel that there's inaccuracies, the idea is that you can also have people who know the truth go on there and correct it and debate about it, if that is what is necessary to get an accurate view. Whereas if you say something to Newsweek, and they print something that's incorrect, you're stuck.\nDS: Very good to talk to you. Best of luck, Senator Brownback."}

They operate a national communication network and provides network feeds and broadcast services for the major television and radio networks in New Zealand.\nThe annual report shows Kordia Group Limited's net profit, after tax, at NZ$11.9 million, the 2006 result was $9.8 million. Revenue was up from $201 million in the 2006 financial year to $264 million this year; a 31% increase. Chairman of Kordia, Wayne Brown, described this financial year as \"solid achievement\" while being \"on track to record further growth in the exciting fields in which it operates.\"\nThese increases is despite the major acquisition of Orcon Internet Limited, an ISP (Internet service provider). Kordia will use Orcon, acquired on 2 July, 2007, to invest and deliver the possibilities of the current progress of local loop unbundling, new Wi-Fi zones, and WiMAX technology. CEO of Kordia, Geoff Hunt, said, \"Orcon will soon offer a complete range of Voice over IP products\". Orcon is being operated at arms-length to the rest of the company.\nOther areas where Kordia is advancing itself is mobile television transmission where they are already prepared to start services once content providers have been secured. Hunt said, \"Spectrum is available, so all we need are the content providers and some good consumer demand. Then we'll be ready to roll.\"\nKordia is also immersing itself further in the television sector as well as its mobile television service. Other advances includes New Zealand's new digital television service, Freeview with it set to start terrestrial transmission next year.\nParliament TV also began this year in July. All House proceedings are available via the Parliament website and a broadcast quality feed is provided to all broadcasters, with full coverage being televised by Freeview and Sky Network Television. The manager of Kordia's Transmission Control Centre, Merv Brooks, said, \"This is another example of people and technology coming together to deliver a truly unique product to New Zealanders.\"\nBeing a SOE, Kordia is required to give the Government a dividend. The Government will receive a total dividend of $8.4 million; $6.8 million in 2006. A $3 million dividend had already been received by the Government so a payment of only $5.4 million was made."}

Every day from Wednesday October 10 to Sunday October 14 they will write and podcast about the big names to meet, the events not to be missed and their very personal experiences and thoughts. Three of the bloggers write in English, two English language podcasts are done, to widen the reach of the Book Fair 2.0. The blog entries and podcasts will be available until after the book fair at http://www.book-fair.com/en/wordpress/ and the bloggers themselves can be visited on the weekend at hall 4.2, Q411, though until now it is more the media and less the visitors of the fair, the bloggers come in contact with.\nEBooks and Digitalization.\nDigitalization and digital media, especially books and magazines offered digitally, are a hot topic at this year's Frankfurt Book Fair, as more and more publishers want to see the digital counterparts of their traditional media not just as a field to be present in, but as a possible profit center. With scientific books, this move already was quite successful: Publishing house Springer for example, offering over 40,000 ebooks and over 1700 electronic magazines, of which over 1200 are still actively continued with Springer, nowadays does an ebook-variant of every traditional scientific book they print - and already has the largest part of their cash-flow from digital media. \nThis is harder for fiction publishing houses as the Pabel M\u00f6wig group (VPM), which has become active early. They do offer the digitized new adventures of \u2013 say, the outer-space-hero Perry Rhodan -, but the turnover is still only a small addition to the print and other media versions. Readers become readier to read on a screen, but their readiness is still growing slowly. Since a new generation of readers is growing up using the internet as a reference work \u2013 especially Google and Wikipedia \u2013 it will become more and more natural in the future.\nA growing number of service companies in the publishing sector therefore offers re-digitalization apart from increasingly effective content management systems, with which new forms of media can easily be compiled from the contents of a data base. Older works, of which the publishing house owns the rights, but for which a reprint might not be profitable, are scanned, divided into content sections and tagged. When the original type face isn\u2019t good enough, books are typewritten in third world countries two or three times which are corrected and merged into a final version. Once in the system, digitalized books can be at disposal as MobiPocket ebooks or Print On Demand (POD) and with aid of the Amazon BookSurge program remain available, possibly even within 24 hours. \nDigital content can also be used as a marketing-tool with the \"Search Inside\" from Amazon.com, where the full text of a book is visible but only small parts of the book are shown at a time. \nRight after Amazon, Google also presented their own projects for the digitalization of books, where publishers have the option of just sending a box or container full of their books in printed form and leave the job of digitalization to Google, where afterwards their content will be findable with Google Book Search. The difference between those two internet services was obvious, though: Amazon wants to earn money with books, while Google's business is advertising, their revenue model is AdSense and AdWords, targeted as perfect as possible with full text search. Both services had to answer questions as to how they will protect the content from unpaid exploitation, as probably fewer and fewer users will be willing to pay for a digital eBook when they can read the content for free, up to twenty pages at a time. The freeloader mentality of many Internet users was seen as a threat by many of the publishers. \nPirates threatening the audiobooks.\nOne product seen as endangered more than other media by the widespread internet piratery is the audiobooks. One of the more ambitious audiobook productions on five CDs would cost about 80,000 Euros and needs about 30,000 copies sold to sell at a profit. Once only 10,000 copies are sold and 20,000 downloaded via illegal filesharing on the internet, the model isn't profitable anymore, and the audiobook market, now thriving, might wither away again, explained Johannes Stricker of 'Der H\u00f6rverlag' publishing. Sideprofits possible in the music business are not possible for audiobooks: concerts are not the same as the public readings, which are often a deficit affair, and no one wants to pay for audiobook ringtones. On top of that, one complete work is much more costly than an album full of music, often 29, 49, 79 or even 99 Euros have to be paid for a full length reading. These prices in mind, especially young listeners rather take the free filesharing, especially as a bad conscience or the thought that this is illegal is absent from the young minds, as Oliver Rohrbeck, a famous speaker of one of Alfred Hitchcock's 'Three Investigators' detectives in Germany, complained. He admitted that he had compiled a tape for a friend as a gesture of love from time to time. Anyone using illegal downloads for such a gesture of love nowadays would face harsh fines, if only it were easier to get a little criminal to court."}

Syria's President Bashar al-Assad previously said that Israeli jets had dropped bombs on an unused military building.\nAlthough Syria has signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, it has a legal right to build a nuclear reactor for the purposes of generating electricity, and it is not obligated to disclose work on such a reactor during the early stages of construction. \nAccording to The New York Times sources, the Bush administration was divided at the time over whether to support the Israeli attack. The article quotes an American official as saying that \"[t]here wasn\u2019t a lot of debate about the evidence [of the reactor's existence]\", but that \"[t]here was a lot of debate about how to respond to it.\" \nThe attack is reminiscent of a 1981 Israeli raid that destroyed the Osirak nuclear reactor in Iraq shortly before it was scheduled to come online. Bush administration officials have stated that the 1981 attack set back Iraq's nuclear program by many years. The New York Times article quotes an Israeli official as saying that the purpose of the strike was to \"re-establish the credibility of our deterrent power.\""}

According to the official, Russian intelligence has reason to believe that the terrorist groups have already been assembled and include individuals training to kidnap the Russian President, and to sacrifice their lives during a suicide bombing.\nKremlin deputy spokeman Dmitry Peskov told \"Reuters\" that there were currently no plans to cancel Putin's historic trip, the first visit to Iran by a Kremlin leader since Josef Stalin during a wartime summit in 1943. The Russian president is planning to visit Tehran to attend a summit of the five states which border the Caspian Sea. He will arrive in Iran on Wednesday.\nPutin is also expected to meet with Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to discuss a peaceful solution to the questions regarding Iran's nuclear program, specifically its desire to acquire an atomic bomb. Although Russia has supported two rounds of restrictive UN sanctions against Iran, the Russian government says publicly that it believes that direct engagement is the most effective way to handle the situation. Russian officials have told \"Reuters\" privately that they do not support Ahmadinejad's radical ideas, and that visiting Tehran could very well widen the gap of differences with the West over how to handle Iran.\nRussia has sold weapons to Iran in the past, despite American protestation. The Russian government is currently helping to build a nuclear power facility at Busehr, Iran, on the Persian Gulf. \nAnalysts say that delays in finishing the Bushehr power station are an indication that, regardless of what it says publicly, the Kremlin is uncomfortable with the Ahmadinejad administration. Moscow says the delays have been caused by technical problems.\nAre the Reports Reliable?\nMohammed Ali Hosseini, the Iranian foreign ministry spokesman, denied the reliability of the reports.\n\"Reports published by some media are totally baseless and are in line with the psychological war launched by enemies who want to harm Iran and Russia's relationship...Such erroneous reports will have no effect on the program already decided upon for Mr. Putin's visit to Tehran,\" he said. He seemed to indicate that the report was a creation of Iran's western enemies. \nConversely, a member of the Russian parliament's security committee has said that the report is likely reliable.\n\"For me this report has not come as a big revelation, because, unfortunately, today there are enough radical organisations, forces and movements of an extremist nature, oriented against Russia, which would like to settle a score with the Russian president,\" Gennadiy Gudkov told the state-owned Russian news channel, Vesti TV. \n\"There are certainly organisations of this kind in Tehran, which in recent times has unfortunately been a stronghold of radical Islamic organisations,\" he said. \nThe Moscow correspondent for the Christian Science Monitor, Fred Weir, told Al Jazeera that assassination plots against the Putin had previously been uncovered in the Ukraine and Azerbaijan, both believed to be connected to the separatist movement in Chechnya. \n\"It could be some international scheme, perhaps connected with Russia's enemies like the Chechens,\" he said. \n\"Or it could be some elaborate rumor, in Russia we have this transitional phase, we are not sure if Putin is leaving his job or changing his job next year. All of this sort of thing excites power struggles and rumors are a major weapon in that.\" "}

The wreck caused a massive fire that burned for over six hours. It was previously believed that only 13 semi trucks were involved.\n\"The fire burned in a very intense state for approximately four hours and basically consumed everything that was burnable,\" said John Tripp the Fire Chief for L.A. county. \nAs a result of the crash, the Governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger issued a declaration of a state of emergency for Los Angeles County.\nThe debris has been removed and officials say that a full inspection will have to be done on the tunnel before it can be used again because the structure of the tunnel has been compromised. The tunnel passed inspection in June of 2006.\n\"The walls of the tunnel are fairly heavily damaged. None of the rebar appears to be melted, damaged at this point in time. But it's completely separated from the walls in a number of areas, so we lose vertical support when that happens,\" said California Department of Transportation official, Doug Failing.\nTripp added that more bodies could be buried in the wreckage, saying \"...we're going to have to do a very methodical search. There could be unfortunately more people that were not able to escape.\" So far authorities have yet to identify the three people who were killed.\nA full investigation is being conducted into what caused the crash."}

Several others who helped in the conference's creation include: Andrew Guyton, Dan Rosenthal, Geoff Swanstrom, Hillary Lipko, Jessica Gibson, Matt Britt, and \"Wikinews\" administrator and contributor .\n\"We went forward after Wikimania because we felt that we had a good idea on our hands, and all the organization and manpower should not go to waste. We can still make a difference here in our own hemisphere, which as far as Wikimedia goes, has been overlooked in favor of the world picture. We want to show the work done by people here, and how it impacts people here,\" said Halterman in an exclusive interview with \"Wikinews\".\nThe conference is focused on \"discussions of Wikimedia and the free culture movement and how they relate to communities (national/regional, social, linguistic); discussions about the impacts free culture movements have in these communities, and by the work done in said movements in everyday life,\" says the announcement. The discussion includes North America, specifically the United States and Canada, along with the countries of Latin America. Wikimedia Argentina and the WMF have also been given a proposal, but decisions on endorsement are still pending for both.\nThere will also be a journalism segment that will be held inside the Turner Broadcasting building on Techwood Drive in Midtown Atlanta.\nAfter the location of Wikimania 2008 was announced to be in Alexandria, Egypt, the LGBT community spoke out, wondering if the jury, a group of Wikimedians who selected the location, took into account , safety of all attending, , or free speech in the country before making their decision. There has since been discussion and controversy over the location posted on several public mailing lists.\nDespite that, Halterman, who was on the bidding team to have Wikimania 2008 in Atlanta, states that the \"Conference of the Americas\" was not formed in retaliation, revenge or to \"out maneuver\" Wikimania 2008 and that the discussion for the COTA was taking place long before the location of Wikimania was announced. He also states that the conference's purpose is not to compete with it, but to give those who are in the western hemisphere a chance to attend a Wikimedia event for the Americas.\n\"This was never something that was supposed to be 'the American solution.' We aren't trying to compete with Wikimania at all. We're not out to make a statement against Wikimania. This isn't done out of anger, it's done out of a drive to unite, not to divide. We have over 100 interested parties all over the United States who want to volunteer and/or attend in some fashion or another. Reaching out to the other communities is high on our list of priorities and we really do want to make this a hemispheric effort\" as \"it's more expensive for people to go to Egypt over something in their own country or something close enough to it,\" said Halterman to Wikinews.\nThe conference is sponsored by Georgia Tech, the , the Public Journalism Network (pjnet), and the Carolina Open Source Initiative."}

The raids were under the Terrorism Suppression Act 2002 and Arms Act.\nThe raids, conducted by over 300 armed police officers, focused on indigenous M\u0101ori and environmental activists, including activist Tame Iti. Iti faces eight counts relating to firearms, including having a semi-automatic shotgun and two molotov cocktails. He is well known in New Zealand for many high profile cases, including a sedition charge for shooting the New Zealand flag, for which he was later acquitted, during Waitangi day in 2005.\nPolice Commissioner Howard Broad said that those targeted were from various ethnicities and from different motivations.\nCommissioner Broad said, \"It was military-style activity they were training for\", adding that he did not believe \"protest activity involves firearms or other weapons.\" One training camp raided by police was \"guerilla-style\" in the Urewera mountain ranges. Guns, ammunition and grenades were found in the camp. \nNo one has yet been charged with a crime against the Terrorism Suppression Act, only with charges relating to the Arms Act. \"[The Police] are proceeding with full care in talking to people and assessing information before we can determine whether there is sufficient evidence to seek the consent of the Attorney General through the Solicitor General to charge anyone under [the Terrorism Suppression Act],\" Commissioner Broad said. \"This is the first time that the Terrorism Suppression Act has been considered in terms of an operation.\"\nWarrants were executed in New Zealand's largest city, Auckland; the capital, Wellington; Christchurch; Palmerston North and towns in the Eastern Bay of Plenty region. The warrants were issued under the Summary Proceedings Act, which allows searching for evidence of committing an offence against the Terrorism Suppression and Arms acts.\nThe police were informed of the existence of the camps by hunters who stumbled across a training operation being conducted by the groups. The raids were undertaken after evidence was gathered during 2006 and 2007 and followed months of police work. Police had infiltrated the camps, and taken video footage of weapons training. Phone and text message communications and conversations between suspects were recorded. Commissioner Broad said, \"Based on the information and the activity known to have taken place, I decided it was prudent that action should be taken in the interests of public safety.\". Reports have indicated a specific threat to the Prime Minister, Helen Clark, was involved.\nPrime Minister Helen Clark was briefed on the raids last week by police but refused to comment to reporters earlier today.\nThose who have been arrested and appeared in court today were given interim name suppression."}

How is the tour going?\nDS: You guys played in Southpaw right; how was that?\nDS: This interview may be something different than you guys are used to, because although the questions will be about your music, they will be more about the both of you. They are surveys of the landscape. For instance, in the last week I have interviews the proprietors and mistresses of an S&amp;M dungeon; Evangelical Christian Presidential candidate Sam Brownback, the President of the ACLU, Augusten Burroughs, and the High Priest of the Church of Satan, and now you.\nDS: A lot of the questions might be a little different than what you are typically used to; maybe that will make it more interesting for you, or less pleasant. One of the first questions I like to ask musicians is about the challenge to be innovative when so much has already been done. How do you not let that affect your output? \nDS: Was that your Dogme influence?\nDS: You embrace it.\nDS: It's too self-aware?\nDS: Since you are so upfront about your influences, you do still have unique sound. Do the constant comparison in the music media grow tiresome?\nDS: Did you guys follow the Phil Spector trial?\nDS: Knowing Ronnie Spector it must have been an interesting perspective to see it from.\nDS: Dogme influenced you guys early on, does it still?\nDS: Are you more inspired by things in nature or man made things?\nDS: Sure; made by man.\nDS: It's an open question.\nDS: Like cities vs. mountains.\nOn America.\nDS: Sune, you went through a period where you got really tired of LA and New York and traveled around the United States.

The ACLU of Nevada had appealed to halt all executions in the state.\nAn overwhelming legal uproar over death by lethal injection has compelled the U.S. Supreme Court to review the constitutionality of a method of execution for the first time since 1878, while also halting capital punishment throughout the country. \nAlmost all of the 38 states which employ the death penalty rely on the same three-drug combination to execute inmates, including Nevada. In California, opposition to lethal injection has halted executions for nearly two years. The U.S. Supreme Court's recent decision to determine the constitutionality of Kentucky's lethal injection procedure has ensured a near-abeyance on executions until the justices make their ruling next year.\nHoward Skolnik, the Nevada Corrections Director, said Castillo was disappointed when he told him about the delay.\n\"He asked if it would be possible to get a little more medication to calm him down and take the edge off,\" the director said.\nWhen speaking of the two members of Brendt's family hoping to witness the execution, Skolnik said \"They were hoping for some kind of closure today which they did not get.\"\nOne of the ACLU lawyers who pleaded the case Monday in front of the Supreme Court supported the decision, which had been signed by all seven justices.\n\"Clearly, this was the right thing to do, legally and morally,\" Lee Rowland said.

Like \u2018Trotskyite\u2019--there never really existed this phrase \"Osama bin Ladenist.\" Do you think it elevated bin Laden?\nDS: But the thinking is there. Right after the Soviet Union ended--you could sense it, you could feel it in the air--this \"Who do we set our sights on?\" I think that all of us felt that way to a degree, if not just because we were socialized to think that way.\nDS: Denouncing \u2018Islamofascism\u2019...\nDS: Do you think it's a little bit trying to fit a square peg through a round hole, like the old paradigm of the Soviet Union as the evil empire, and now the evil empire is this very disparate range of peoples from Indonesia to Iran and trying to make them into a \u2018Soviet Union?\u2019\nDS: It's worked. It's sold.\nDS: They are going to be spending a lot more; it'll be a trillion dollar war.\nDS: Was there a moment where your switch was flicked, where you were like, \"I've had enough.\" Was there a breaking point?\nDS: [chuckles]\nDS: Did you really?\nDS: Is he dead?\nDS: Or suffering--\nDS: Orwell forms such a fundamental basis for so much neoconservative thinking, almost as an ideological text. Like The Outsiders forms our sense of what a rebel is to a degree, and Orwell gives us a worldview of--\nDS: What about 1984?\nDS: All of a sudden you'll be in an Orwell genre: Orwell criticism--\nDS: 1984 is used by both liberals and conservatives to attack each--each in different ways--\nOn the future of the narrative.\nDS: As a writer there's always a desire to be innovative and original, but you can't be original anymore in writing. It's very difficult. Almost everything has been done. I think that I read somewhere that the only genre of art that hasn't fully been mined is maybe poetry.\nDS: How do you handle the challenge with wanting to be--\nDS: What are they?\nDS: Can you conceptualize that to an example?\nDS: On an Internet forum.\nDS: Once you can envision it, the technology will follow, though. Once you can start seeing it.\nDS: A very common thing for a writer is to be riddled with self-doubt, and that can often ruin a lot of inspiration and creativity and make you lose your way in what you're doing. How do you handle a challenge like that?\nOn changing the literary canon.\nDS: Do you have a memory that has stuck with you that--where you continually turn back to it to learn new lessons?\nDS: Is there one that stands out?\nDS: She smells like a street urchin?\nDS: And that brings back a lot--the olfactory memories?\nDS: No, I'd love to hear your dream.\nDS: Sure.\n[\"both chuckle\"]\nDS: Do you do dream analysis?\nDS: Like Animal Farm?\nDS: What's a book that every kid in high school reads that you think should be removed?\nDS: Clearly a lot can be gained from literature, and as you've have shown talking about Shakespeare here. But you think there might be a problem with building a new generation of readers, in that we train people to read things that they can't relate to? It would be like raising kids to watch Bette Davis movies, and then you get to watch the Harry Potter film.\nDS: Is there at all a movement for that?\nDS: But can't you see such a reaction against that change?\nDS: [laughs]\nDS: There's a magical thing that happens when people feel they discover things that went to the wayside--think about bell bottoms! I remember in the early 90s, the idea of bell bottoms, or even just large pants at the bottom, was just anathema.\nDS: And then all of a sudden it's like people get bored with the same thing, and boom! Bell bottoms are back.\nDS: People who are raised watching \"Die Hard\" and Schwarzenegger, all of a sudden they discover old Joan Crawford films.\nOn belief in a higher power.\nDS: Do you believe in a higher power?\nDS: How do you raise your children?\nDS: How do you circumvent that in the rearing of children, then?\nDS: Why would you be afraid to have it published that you're part Jewish?\nDS: [chuckles] As a big \"Fuck you\" to Judaism, or--?\nDS: So you're going to be baptized into the Gnostic church?\nDS: It's an odd concept.\nDS: Southern Baptist?\nDS: They're one of the least intolerant.\nDS: I went through a Southern Baptist phase when I lived in Georgia.\nDS: Yeah, yeah. The Southern Baptist convention is probably the most conservative out there.\nOn politics.\nDS: If you were forced to choose, which war would you prefer to fight in, Iraq or Afghanistan?\nDS: On the side of the United States.\nDS: Afghanistan?\nDS: Hillary or Barack?\nDS: If you remain that lean on the campaign trail, when they're having all those--\nDS: [\"laughs\"]\nOn self-destruction and survival.\nDS: How would you choose to die?\nDS: You think that most men, pre-parenthood, lose their sense of mortality and their fear of it?\nDS: Were you ever afraid of it?\nDS: Did that affect your behavior?\nDS: \"Where does it go?\"\nDS: An afterlife?\nDS: What's a trait you deplore in yourself?\nDS: Isn't that always the case?\nDS: How is it your best trait?\nDS: Is that also how it's one of your worst, then?\nDS: What\u2019s a time that this trait screwed you over.\nDS: How so? Typical drug, alcohol problems, or--\nDS: Like Joseph Grand in The Plague where he was rewriting the same sentence over and over?\nDS: What do you think it is that drives many artists to sink their own ships?\nDS: Do you think that Norman Rockwell had that inclination?\nDS: I don't know, either. No by his popular image.\nDS: What's your most treasured possession? You can't include kids, because they're not really possessions.\nDS: Is it your most treasured?\nDS: Yeah, definitely.\nDS: Mmm. I feel that, yeah.\nDS: What makes it a scraper?\nDS: You could be scraping meat off bones.\nDS: I have treasured possessions, but I also have treasured memories. I found a suicide in the woods when I was thirteen: a kid my age, who was probably fourteen. It's a treasured memory in some ways, one that\u2019s lasted my whole life, and it's come back in a lot of ways. On my MySpace profile, I make an allusion to that in my narrative. I don't think people actually read that. I think that people look at pictures, and then they move on. But that's not really true. I have been contacted by both that individual's younger sister, who was eight when he killed himself, and the girlfriend he killed himself over. Separately.\nOn raising children.\nDS: Really?\nDS: Gives it depth and also maybe opens you up to a new audience.\nDS: Especially based in New York.\nDS: Do you find that when you have friends outside the city, and they know you're raising kids here, they bate their breath? So many people still have this vision of New York from like \"The Warriors,\"; from the Abe Beame days of New York.\nDS: So many parents think that--my sister would be one--the preference of that controlled atmosphere is better for the kids. They don't realize what they lose not living in an urban center.\nDS: People creating this thriving environment where we can influence each other, and kids --\nDS: --have more stimulus. When you see news reports that on the discovery of an Earthlike planet does that affect your perspective or does it go unnoticed?\nDS: If you had to choose, and you had to choose or both would be devastated and destroyed, which continent would you have blown up, Asia or Africa?\nDS: Or they both go.\nDS: So it would be a sum total of human life, as opposed to your judgement of cultural significance, or--?\nOn paedophilia and the death penalty.\nDS: What do you regard as the lowest depth of misery?\nDS: Augusten Burroughs made the exact same point; the death penalty came up when we were talking, too.\nDS: He's a very dynamic person to talk to. He was like, \u2018I'm not one of those people who cares about the whole taking another life. I feel like when you damage a child, you've damaged them. You've given up your right to be here amongst us.\u2019\nDS: I'm pretty ambivalent on the death penalty. It doesn't bother me on some philosophical level, like the death, you know? But I think that the argument that makes me ambivalent as opposed to pro- what worries me is the idea that there's innocent people being put to death.\nDS: They're still out there. Just recently, there was some 15-year-old girl who was--\nOn personal relationships.\nDS: What do you value most in your friends?\nDS: Loyalty?\nDS: Before you got married, what would have been a bigger turnoff for you with your wife, her speaking in a baby voice, or her being overly flatulent?\nDS: Say, both scenarios in bed.\nDS: Than a baby voice.\nDS: Like what?\nDS: Is there a lot of brainy pillow talk in your household?"}

Wilson and Peter H. Raven predicted dire consequences for the planet's biodiversity and habitability unless current trends in consumption and environmental degradation are reversed. The two scientists were awarded the Addison Emery Verrill Medal by the Peabody Museum of Natural History for their contributions to natural science before a capacity crowd at Yale's Sprague Hall. Both are known for their environmental activism as well as extensive research and popular writing.\nWilson, known for his contributions to island biogeography as well as the controversial field of sociobiology, said that humans\u2014like all earth species\u2014are adapted to \"this\" world. But most people have the dangerous attitude that this world is \"a waystation for a better world\", warned Wilson. Humans could cause the extinction of half of all species by the end of the next century, he stated.\nThe event was billed as a debate between the two scientists, but they found little to disagree about. (Raven quipped that he did not care for Wilson's tie, the extent of their disagreement for the evening.) Raven pointed to unsustainably high levels of consumption, especially in the United States, that will lead to ecological disaster if left unchecked. Levels of consumption have to be cut drastically, he argued. But Wilson claimed that it would be possible to maintain and even improve quality of life even while significantly reducing the population's ecological footprint. Current models, he said, predict that human population will peak at around 9 billion, and that \"if we use what we have\" intelligently, the world could be a sustainable paradise by the 22nd century.\nRaven and Wilson both argued for the compatibility of Christian and environmentalist viewpoints. According to the second chapter of Genesis, said Raven, man was put on the earth in order to preserve it. Wilson said that we need to \"form an alliance\" to save life on earth\u2014an alliance including both religious and non-religious people\u2014and that one can be a \"conservative right-wing Christian\" \"and\" an environmentalist. His recent work, including the Encyclopedia of Life, has focused on creating such an alliance.\nThe most important thing, Raven said, is to expose children to nature. Invoking the argument of Rachel Carson's 1965 \"A Sense of Wonder\", Raven said that children between the ages of four and ten are extremely impressionable, and that teaching them to appreciate the natural world will be the most effective way to ensure environmental consciousness in the next generation. But although Raven was a naturalist from a young age, he said that he \"didn't give a thought to conservation\" while in graduate school in the 1950s. Carson's 1962 book on the dangers of pesticides, \"Silent Spring\", was Raven's introduction to dangers of environmental degradation. Wilson also emphasized Carson's legacy for the environmental movement; he proudly noted that Carson biographer Linda Lear had recently called him the \"only surviving person who actually helped Rachel Carson\" put together \"Silent Spring\".\nRaven and Wilson were only the 16th and 17th, respectively, to receive the Verrill Medal, which is the highest honor awarded by the Peabody Museum. Before a sympathetic crowd, Wilson tactfully avoided any mention of his own institution, Yale's rival Harvard University."}

The patent examiner, however, rejected claims 1 to 5 and 11 to 15. Amazon now has up to six months to amend the rejected claims to overcome the examiner's rejection, provide arguments to demonstrate that the examiner is in error and/or provide evidence to demonstrate the patentability of their claims. During this period, the entire patent is still considered valid under US patent law.\nThe USPTO is reconsidering the patentability of the claims due to a request for reexamination filed by New Zealander Peter Calveley. Mr. Calveley used internet archives to show that defunct company Digi Cash used a similar technique prior to Amazon. Despite costing a substantial sum of cash and requiring donations to prepare and file the request for reexamination, Calveley said he did it as a game and hopes that his success inspires others to play the same game.\n\"One Click\" shopping is an ecommerce technique, which allows a customer to purchase products via the Internet without repeatedly entering personal information such as name and address. At the time it was introduced it eased the frustration of on-line shopping. \nAmazon filed the patent application for 1-click shopping in early 1997 and was granted the patent in September 1999. 23 days later Amazon sued rival Barnes &amp; Noble for alleged infringement by its \"Express Lane\" ordering which was introduced in 1998. In December 1999 Amazon won an interim injunction against Barnes &amp; Noble but the USA Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit lifted this injunction in February 2001. The parties then settled their dispute for undisclosed terms. Amazon has since successfully licensed the technique to other e-sellers such as Apple."}

How do you feel about the community partnering with such a big name in journalism?\nMike: The proposal is basically that Turner will give us a venue for the conference and bring in industry people to speak, in addition to more citizen-oriented speakers and our own from Wikinews. I know personally I didn't believe such a media conglomerate would want to partner with free culture, so it was surprising to me. Does it surprise you, or do you see a good working relationship between \"free\" and \"for profit\" journalism outlets?\nBrian: we had a reporter with the beeb for a week\nDodge: And the BBC used some of our content earlier\nMatt: Do you think the fact that they can reuse what we make in partnership with them is one of the reasons for people wanting to partner with us, whereas a lot of traditional media want to retain copyright on work?\nBrian: If they don't understand GFDL, is CC-BY (per Wikinews) better for their legal folks?\nMatt: Do you believe that (at least for non-profit news sources), releasing material into the public domain makes it simpler for them to manage/handle?\nBrian: or do they not understand PD?\nBrian: For wikinews all they have to do is credit us with the story to comply with the license\nBrian: Yes, a link to us would be nice too\nMatt: Yeah, as long as they state its CC-BY-2.5 and give our name, they can use it.

Will they be turned down because they have written for an online website like Wikinews, which is not particularly fond of the mainstream media, and not traditional media?\nMatt: Although you have an account on the English wikinews (), you have never edited.

The crash sent the market tumbling down 508 points, losing nearly 24%. On Friday, the Dow Jones nearly broke that record when the market closed at -366.94 points, down almost three percent.\nSeveral factors could be to blame for the loss, one being Turkey's government approving a measure on October 18 to send Turkish troops into Iraq in an attempt to take out militants of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK). This sent oil prices skyrocketing to the highest prices in history, with the highest record being just over US$89.00, which was set on October 18.\nFears that the housing market in the U.S. has come to a standstill has also lead Caterpillar Inc., which manufactures and sells construction equipment to issue a warning that the standstill would cause profits to drop, and the American economy to be severely hurt.

Instead, live missiles were placed on the planes wings, along with six of the \"dummy missiles,\" before it took off from Minot AFB. The air force says that this was a \"serious error\" on the part of the military, and is launching a formal and ongoing investigation. \nSo far, the investigation states that the missiles loaded onto the plane were supposed to be inspected by looking through a portal on each missile, where a code would determine whether or not the missile was armed or a dummy. The inspector who loaded the missiles onto the plane only looked under the wing where the armed missiles were located and the plane's navigator also failed to perform a proper inspection.\nThe numbers on an out-dated piece of paper were also not checked prior to the missiles being loaded on the plane despite the fact that the air force already had a system which is supposed to track the missiles.\n\"[The incident is an] erosion of adherence to weapons-handling standards. In the countless times our dedicated airmen have transferred weapons in our nation's arsenal, nothing like this has ever occurred. This was an unacceptable error that resulted in an unprecedented string of procedural failures,\" said Air Force Deputy Chief of Staff, Major General Richard Newton who also said that the plane's crew did not know that the missiles were on board the plane.\nU.S. air force officials state that there was no threat of a nuclear explosion had the plane crashed, but that a radiation leak was possible.\nOfficials said that they want to make sure they \"hold ourselves accountable to the American people and want to ensure proper corrective action has been taken.\"\nAt least four colonels and at least one lieutenant were suspended from duty. At least 66 other personnel were also relieved including Colonel Bruce Emig, the commander of the B-52 5th Bomb Wing team and two other members. Officials say that criminal charges have not yet been filed against anyone involved in the incident, but did not rule them out."}

Bush and Russian President Vladimir Putin have been in a war of words this week, with Bush suggesting that the Iranian nuclear program could be the lynchpin for launching World War III.\n\"So I\u2019ve told people that, if you\u2019re interested in avoiding World War III, it seems like you ought to be interested in preventing them from having the knowledge necessary to make a nuclear weapon\" and \"we got a leader in Iran who has announced that he wants to destroy Israel. My intent is to continue to rally the world, to send a focused signal to the Iranian government that we will continue to work to isolate you in the hopes that at some point somebody else shows up and says it\u2019s not worth the isolation,\" said Bush during a press conference.\nThe Tehran Times responded to Bush reporting that \"either Bush has gone totally mad and now makes statements without consulting his advisors, or the neo-conservatives are dreaming of a new world order and no longer feel compelled to hide their goal and U.S. officials should put a muzzle on Bush to prevent him from giving people the impression that the United States is the main threat to world peace.\"\nPutin in a telephone question and answer session advises that Russia is developing a \"big, grandiose\" plan to boost the country's defenses with new types of nuclear weapons to defeat the U.S. anti-missile system based in Europe.\n\"Our plans are not simply considerable, but huge. At the same time they are absolutely realistic. I have no doubts we will accomplish them. I can assure you that such steps are being prepared and we will take them,\" stated Putin.\nAnalysts said Mr Putin's latest remarks were designed to reassure his public that Russia still had an effective nuclear deterrent. But they were also a message to Washington: that its new and costly missile shield was effectively useless against the latest Russian technology.\nPutin even suggested that the U.S. might be after Siberia\u2019s resources and the U.S. has considered invading Russia. One thing Putin was certain of is that there are quite a few politicians in the United States who engage in what he described as \"political erotica,\" something that \"may or may not give pleasure to people, but is unlikely to generate any results,\" Putin added."}

The suit alleges that the band's cancellation cost fans between US$500,000 (\u20ac349,944) and $3 million (\u20ac2.1 million) in travel and accommodation costs, as well as other related expenses.\nThe sold-out September 26 Maui concert - originally planned months before as the final show of a world tour that began in Brazil in April - was canceled by the band on the basis that they could not make it to the island in time after a September 24 concert in Chicago. The Chicago concert, which attracted 18,000 people, was rescheduled at the last minute after the original September 10 concert date had been postponed due to illness.\nThe band canceled the show at Maui's War Memorial Stadium, which was set to be attended by 9,000 people, and apologized to fans. The band's management company, HK Management Inc., gave no initial reason when they canceled on September 20, but blamed logistical reasons by the next day. \nHowever, just days later, on September 29, the band traveled to the neighbor island of Oahu to play a corporate event in Honolulu for car dealers and private guests. An audience of 6,000 people celebrated the 50th anniversary of the Japanese automobile manufacturer at the University of Hawaii, with Toyota paying $500,000 (\u20ac349,944) to hire the campus. Aerosmith received $1 million (\u20ac700,000) to perform at the event. Faria alleges that Aerosmith abandoned the scheduled public concert on Maui in favor of the more lucrative corporate event on Oahu.\n\"...Defendants simply canceled the only public performance by Aerosmith in favor of the larger Chicago venue and the lucrative, private concert for the Toyota car dealers,\" the complaint states.\nLocal officials had hoped the concert would attract other big names to the island.\nFaria said that \"I've had people contact me being out of pocket at much as $800 or $900,\" adding that if the cancellation is found to be deceptive ticket holders may be eligible for a minimum of $1,000 each. The complaint also says that those aged 62 or over should receive at least $5,000 each. Currently about a dozen ticket holders are involved with the suit. If the action is approved by a judge, steps will be taken to contact everyone who purchased a ticket."}

{"id": "82895", "revid": "39076", "url": "https://en.wikinews.org/wiki?curid=82895", "title": "Teacher sexual misconduct rampant in American schools, says AP", "text": "An \"Associated Press\" investigation published Sunday revealed findings of more than 2,500 cases of sexual misconduct by educators in the American educational system over a five year period. \nThe cases reported in the investigation ranged from the merely strange, with cases involving verbal abuse, to the barbarous, with cases involving molestation and rape.\nInvestigations suggest that many cases of sexual abuse are never reported, and those that are reported often do not lead to punishment for the offender. The cases do not always include enough evidence, and for this as well as other reasons the schools, courts, state governments, and federal governments cannot be sure that they are keeping sexual deviants out of teaching.\nCertain academic studies estimate that only about ten percent of victimized children report sexual abuse of any kind to a person who can take action to help them. When sexual misconduct is reported, teachers, administrators and some parents frequently cannot, either subconsciously or consciously, recognize the warning signs of a crime.\nAfter examining records in all 50 states and the District of Columbia, the AP found that 2,570 educators had their teaching licenses taken away, denied, surrendered voluntarily or restricted from the period of 2001 through 2005, all as a result of sexual misconduct allegations.\nMinors were the victims in at least 1,801 of the cases, and more than 80 percent of those minors were students of the accused criminals. More than half of the educators who were disciplined by their state governments were consequently convicted of crimes related to the allegations of misconduct.\nThe cases that the AP found were those of all types of educators -- teachers, school psychologists, and even principals and superintendents. The accused are often popular with students and parents, and are widely perceived as good teachers. In nearly 90 percent if the cases, the offenders are male. While certain educators were accused of sexual misconduct in school, others were cited for abuse that occurred after hours and did not always involve one of their own students. At least 446 of the cases uncovered by the AP involved educators with multiple victims.\nA preponderance of cases involved teachers in public schools since many private schools do not require their teachers to be licensed and most private schools do not allow their disciplinary records to be publicly viewed.\nThe American Federation of Teachers (AFT) and the National Education Association (NEA), two large teaching unions, each decried sexual abuse while pinpointing the importance of considering educators' rights.\n\"If there's one incident of sexual misconduct between a teacher and a student that's one too many,\" Kathy Buzad of the AFT told the Associated Press.\n\"Students must be protected from sexual predators and abuse, and teachers must be protected from false accusations,\" said NEA President Reg Weaver in a press release.\nHowever, while the AP found attempts to stop particular offenders, it also discovered a firm resistance towards identifying and preventing abuse. In schools, fellow teachers often ignore the abuse or feel they cannot help. School administrators cut backdoor deals to sidestep lawsuits or bad press. And in state governments and Congress, lawmakers are weary to impose harsher punishments or any national policy in fear of harming an important profession. \nFor example, in the state of California some of the most sadistic sex abuse is flagged, but state law allows a multitude of offenses to remain confidential in disciplinary records, even when teachers are sentenced to imprisonment and become registered sex offenders. \nThe dearth of information is evidence of a system of disciplining teachers that, nationwide, is often cloaked in secrecy. It is difficult for states to share necessary information about those accused of misconduct and allows some to find classroom jobs in other states.\nAn additional problem is that while the National Association of State Directors of Teacher Education and Certification maintains a listing of educators who've been disciplined for any reason, it only shares this information with other state agencies. Also, many teachers do not appear on the list because they resign before losing their licenses.\n\"(Schools) might deal with it internally, suspending the person or having the person move on. So their license is never investigated,\" says Charol Shakeshaft, an expert in educational sexual abuse who leads Virginia Commonwealth University's educational leadership department.\n\"There is the possibility that one of these people could move to another jurisdiction, most likely another state, and you wouldn't be able to find out their history,\" says Todd Spitzer, a Californian assemblyman, former prosecutor, and former high school English teacher. \nAnother disturbing trend is that cases of misconduct seem to be on the rise in many places. According to a New York State Education Department report, the number of \"moral misconduct\" accusations against educators in New York has doubled in five years. In 2005, 134 cases of \u201cmoral misconduct\u201d were reported involving teachers and other school employees, as compared to just 70 cases in 2001. According to an overview of the cases, almost 75 percent of the \u201cmoral conduct\u201d cases involved sexual acts or an improper relationship. In all, 485 misconduct cases occurred over the five year period in New York state.\nThe AP's national analysis shows Texas and California with the most sexual misconduct cases, each with two to three times as many cases as New York. Florida proved about the same as New York.\nMary Green, a parent in Washington County who rallied against a teacher she suspected of misconduct, says the key to stopping the abuse is listening. \n\u201cIf a child says such-and-such a person, teacher, coach or neighbor is `weird,' the parent should not simply dismiss this comment, but have the child explain why the person is weird,\u201d she said. \u201cOften we simply shush them without finding out why the child feels that way. People tend to think it won't happen to them.\u201d"}

The $103 million rookie import from Japan, Daisuke Matsuzaka (nicknamed \"Dice-K\"), pitched five innings for Boston, allowing two runs on six hits. Cleveland's Jake Westbrook started and took the loss.

He entered the game with runners on first and second and no outs, but quickly retired the side and in the ninth managed to maintain the nine run lead, once again giving fans a performance of his Riverdance style victory dance. \nIn the seventh inning, Red Sox rookie second baseman Dustin Pedroia hit a two-run home run off of Rafael Betancourt that drove Boston's Fenway Park wild. Boston scored a total of 6 runs in a crazy eighth inning, on a single by J.D.

Youkilis was the first batter he faced in relief of Betancourt.\nThe Sox will go on to face the Colorado Rockies, the surging National League Champions.

It crossed a road and then struck an embankment, bursting into flames, before stopping in a rice field, some 252m from the end of the runway.\nThe pilot is found to have been singing as he began the final descent, in direct contradiction to the Garuda Basic Operations Manual, which calls for activation of the Sterile Cockpit Rule at 10,000 feet and below.\nThe pilot was probably emotionally aroused because his conscious awareness moved from the relaxed mode \u201csinging\u201d to the heightened stressfulness of the desire to reach the runway by making an excessively steep and fast, unstabilised approach,\u201d the report continued. However, it does say that he was fully aware that something was wrong during the approach, as he is recorded as having said \u201cOh, there is something not right.\u201d\nThe report found that that the aircraft was flown by the pilot in command at a speed far exceeding that at which the wing flaps were able to operate properly. The report continues to criticise the pilot further, saying that a cockpit alert by the Ground Proximity Warning System informing the pilot he was flying too fast sounded no less than 15 times, but the pilot failed to abort the landing. He also ignored the co-pilot telling him to execute a 'go-around procedure' after the aircraft struck the runway at speed and bounced back into the air.\nThe co-pilot is himself found to be at error by the report, which points out that he should have taken over the controls from the pilot when it became clear the aircraft was being flown in a dangerous manner. However, the report did note that Garuda Indonesia had failed to give him any simulator training replicating a situation whereby the co-pilot would take over control duties from the pilot in charge due to unsafe handling of the plane; in fact, training was found to be inadequate for both members of the cockpit crew.\nIn the report's own words: \"During the approach, the Ground Proximity Warning System (GPWS) alerts and warnings sounded 15 times, and the copilot called for the pilot in command to go around. \n\"The aircraft was flown at an excessive air speed and steep flight path angle during the approach and landing, resulting in an unstabilised approach. \n\"The pilot in command did not follow company procedures that required him to fly a stabilised approach, and he did not abort the landing and go around when the approach was not stabilised. \n\"His attention was fixated or channelised on landing the aircraft on the runway and he either did not hear, or disregarded the GPWS alerts, and warnings, and calls from the copilot to go around.\" \nAuthorities were also found to be at fault, with the Indonesian Director General of Civil Aviation criticised for failing to identify inadequacies in pilot training procedures. he was also criticised for the fact that the aircraft had managed to go virtually un-inspected, with only two safety checks in a decade.\nThe report adds that the Aircraft Rescue and Firefighting facilities at the airport were also lacking on the day of the accident, for struggling to access the crash site and for not having the appropriate fire suppressant upon their eventual arrival. The report says these delays likely had an impact on the survivability factors on board the plane in the moments after crashing, when the aircraft was in flames. It ultimately took more than two hours before the fire was put out. Another criticism leveled at the airport was that it failed to comply with international runway safety regulations.\nThe report has triggered a call from Caroline Mellish, sister of \"Australian Financial Review\" Morgan Mellish, one of five Australians killed in the accident, for greater co-operation between different Indonesian authorities. \"I think not working together as different departments in a government shows a lack of any sort of system,\" She said from , to which she had travelled for the release of the final report.\n\"If they can't work together in different departments, I don't know how they are going to run a country and make any difference investigating this sort of accident and ensuring the recommendations do get carried forward to ensure that no more accident happen.\"\nHowever, she did have some sympathy to spare for the pilot who was in control of the plane that day when the possibility of his prosecution was raised: \"I think having 21 deaths on your conscience is probably enough. I don't think prosecuting the man is going to make any difference.\"\nNational Transport Safety Committee chairman Tatang Kurniadi said that no information from the report would be used in any criminal or civil liability investigations. \"I would like to go back to the objective of this, the report was made by NTSC for safety purposes only, not for blaming,\" he said. \n\"If any institution wants to ... follow up that accident, that's their own decision.\n\"The report contained the results from the cockpit voice recorder and flight data recorder, but according to international regulations on aviation these black boxes are not allowed to be used for... liability purposes.\n\"We will not give police or any institution (information) other than for safety purposes only - it's in international regulations and we want to follow those regulations.\" "}

The study said that rising levels of CO2, the main greenhouse gas blamed for climate change, threaten to accelerate global warming. The study attributes the change in CO2 levels to increased use of fossil fuels and a decline in the amount of gas being absorbed by the oceans and land.\nCO2 emissions have increased by an average of 3.3 percent per year since 2000, compared with 1.1 percent per year in the 1990s. The rate has increased 35 percent more than scientists had anticipated based on economic growth, according to Corinne Le Quere, one of the paper's authors.\n\"The causes of the acceleration are surprising,\" Le Quere said. \"One is that we are not as efficient at using CO2 as we had anticipated, and the second cause is that it appears that the CO2 sinks are weakening.\" The main natural CO2 sinks are the oceans and plants.\nThe study attributed approximately half of the unexpected growth to an increase in the carbon intensity of the global economy, a measure of the amount of carbon emissions per unit of economic activity. \"For 30 years we were becoming more efficient at using CO2 for producing energy and wealth, and this has completely stalled since 2000,\" Le Quere said, adding that increased use of coal by developing countries such as China and India was partially to blame.\nThe remaining unexpected growth was attributed to a decline in the ability of the oceans and land to absorb CO2. Most climate models do not account for a weakening of CO2 sinks, Le Quere said. Alan Robock, associate director of the Center for Environmental Prediction at Rutgers University, called the reduction of the oceanic CO2 sink \"really shocking\".\nThe study \"raises some very important issues that the public should be aware of: Namely that concentrations of CO2 are increasing at much higher rates than previously expected and this is in spite of the Kyoto Protocol that is designed to hold them down in western countries,\" said Kevin Trenberth, the head of the Climate Analysis Section at the National Center for Atmospheric Research and a lead author of the 2007 assessment report of the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).\nThe IPCC predicted in February of this year that temperatures would rise by up to 6.4 degrees Celsius over the next century. However, Le Quere suggested that this scenario might be overly optimistic. \"There\u2019s quite a significant difference from what was forecast,\u201d she said. \"It\u2019s rather scary and the IPCC scenarios are, therefore, rather too optimistic \u2014 as if they weren\u2019t bleak enough already. The whole thing is likely to mean mitigation is rather more difficult than was thought.\""}

Five Australians were among the 21 killed when the Boeing 737 jetliner overshot the runway at Adisucipto International Airport, near Yogyakarta, Indonesia on March 7 this year.\nAustralian Minister for Foreign affairs, Alexander Downer, said that the \"very credible report\" made it clear the two-man cockpit crew were responsible for the accident. The report found that alarms sounded no less than 15 times to warn the pilot in command that he was flying at an excessive speed for proper operation of the flaps, and that the co-pilot had also been ignored when he asked for a go-around to be made. The co-pilot was criticised for not taking control of the aircraft. The pilot was found to have ignored 15 emergency activations of the Ground Proximity Warning System telling him to slow down. Other criticisms were leveled at the inadequate training provided by the airline, the inadequate inspections by authorities, the lack of a mandatory runoff area at the runway and improper fire suppressants and slow response from the Aircraft Rescue and Firefighting facilities at the airport.\n\"I've asked our ambassador today to make it absolutely clear to the Indonesians that we want people prosecuted for this accident,\" said Downer. \"I want to see people who have negligently allowed Australians \u2026 to be killed, I want to see those people brought to justice,\" he added. He has also expressed a pledge to discuss plans for a class action suit with survivors and relatives of victims, but he commented that \"you're dealing with the Indonesian system here, it's a different system from our own, so it's not necessarily going to be very easy.\" Bill Madden from the law firm Slater and Gordon, who have a speciality in class actions, disagreed: \"It would seem as though the families and people injured would have a fairly strong case,\" he said. \"You'd be holding an airline responsible for the negligence of a pilot and that's a fairly standard approach that the law can follow.\"\nMeanwhile, the 'Sydney Morning Herarld' spoke with Ari Sapari, head of operations at Garuda Indonesia. He told reporters that the pilots, who remain grounded after the crash, may be sacked next week, when any disciplinary action is expected to be announced. However, if they are charged over the crash, he has promised the airline will assist in their defence, saying \"They are still our employees, up to now. They have the right to be assisted.\" Police say they are examining closely the possibility of charging both with manslaughter, which could see them sent to prison for up to five years if convicted. When queried about the fact that the report found the crew had not received adequate simulator training from the airline, he defended the company, saying \"Nobody is perfect in this entire world.\" Since the suspension of the pilots, all other Garuda pilots have undergone the appropriate training missed out by Garuda.\nAustralian Prime Minister John Howard said in a statement made after the report came out \"I am quite astonished. I can understand how people who are still grieving, both in Indonesia and Australia, might feel.\" \nThe Opposition Leader, Kevin Rudd, has said he has telephoned secretary-general of Indonesia's foreign affairs department and former ambassador to Australia Imron Cotan, telling him that he wanted those responsible \"prosecuted to the absolute full\". \"This is a serious matter, many Australians visit Indonesia, Garuda is an often used airline and there is a basic national interest at stake here as well,\" he said.\nIt is, however, stipulated in the Convention on International Civil Aviation that accident reports and related material, specifically transcripts of interviews, communications with crew and cockpit voice recorder and flight data recorder (collectively known as black boxes) readouts, must not be used for any purpose other than determining the cause of an accident or incident. The only possible exception to this is where potential benefit would outweigh the \"adverse domestic and international impact\" on the investigation in question or any other either in progress or in the future. This legislation is in place to provide protection to witnesses on the basis that without it they may be less likely to cooperate with investigational procedures.\nDowner's response to this law was to comment that \"I think our first priority is to make sure those who are responsible - who survived the accident - are brought to justice.\" Aridono Sukman, the police member in charge of the criminal investigation, has said that the contents of the black box are vital evidence. Officials have commented that some relatives have expressed their frustration over the legal challenges involved in the prosecution effort.\nTatang Kurniadi, chairman of the Indonesian National Transportation Safety Committee, has already confirmed that investigators cannot speak to the police, with the only permitted testimony under the legislation being to testify at a court hearing. He also pointed out that the document does not actually appoint any blame. \"The investigation determined the flight crews' compliance with procedures was not at the level to ensure the safe operation of the aircraft. That's enough,\" he said. However, Sisno Adiwinoto, a police spokesperson, told reporters the police would attempt to summon the investigators to court as expert witnesses on aviation, rather than as the actual investigators involved with the disaster.\nAnother fact that has become apparent is that the runway at Adisucipto International will not be lengthened to meet international standards despite assurances that work would begin shortly. The airport claims it cannot build the mandatory 90-metre runway end safety area because, says a small-print comment by the state-owned airport operator, the airport does not have the land.\" It has, however, promised to bring other airports under its jurisdiction up to standard, with work initialising next year. The company has also stated that a study of engineering methods providing alternative solutions could be completed by June."}

Iran is pursuing the technology that could be used to produce nuclear weapons, and ballistic missiles of increasing range that could deliver them,\" Bush said in a speech at the National Defense University. \"Today, we have no way to defend Europe against the emerging Iranian threat, so we must deploy a missile defense system there that can.\"\nIn his speech, Bush emphasized the threat posed by the range of Iran's missiles. \"Last November, Iran conducted military exercises in which it launched ballistic missiles capable of striking Israel and Turkey,\" Bush said. He warned that, with \"continued foreign assistance\", Iran could develop an ICBM capable of reaching the United States by 2015.\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has suggested that the United States and the West could rely on Russian-operated early warning radar in Azerbaijan to counter missile threats from Iran.\nThe U.S. missile defense plan includes 10 ground-based interceptors in Poland and a radar system in the Czech Republic. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said previously that the shield was seen a \"potential threat\" by Russia and that Russia could take measures to \"neutralize\" it. In his speech, Bush said that the missile shield was not designed to intercept missiles from Russia and \"would be easily overwhelmed by Russia's nuclear arsenal.\"\nAlso on Tuesday, U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates proposed delaying the activation of part of the missile shield if Russia cooperates with the project. \"We continue to encourage the Russians to partner with us in missile defense and continue our efforts to reassure them that these facilities are not aimed at Russia and could benefit Russia,\" Gates said. He also suggested that the missile shield could remain inactive until \"definitive proof\" of a threat arose. \"We would consider tying together the activation of the sites in Poland and the Czech Republic with definitive proof of the threat, in other words, Iranian missile testing and so on,\" he said."}

With Computex Taipei 2008 will add Taipei World Trade Center Nangang Exhibition Hall (TWTC Nangang) area, how TCA transform their ways and goals with operating their IT shows? It will be affected on the notibility of domestic or trade shows. For the three expos status and TWTC Nangang topics, \"Wikinews\" Reporter interviewed TCA Secretary General Enoch Du for some important questions that should be respected by organizers and governments.\nInterview.\nBrock: We saw three expos continuously appeared this week and witnessed the determination from TCA. But before the three expos, with the 2008 Computex Taipei Local Exhibitors' Coordination by TAITRA last month for the exhibition hall usage, what should TCA face on the twin halls (TWTC Hall 1 and TWTC Nangang) problem? How to solve the problem with TWTC Nangang? Because more than ten years before, when Computex Taipei exhibited at Sungshan and TWTC halls, the show didn't have a good work, and I've asked Commissioner of Department of Transportation in Taipei City Hsiao-hsien Lou for the traffic issue with TWTC Nangang, he looked it as a pessimistic way.\nEnoch: We still contact with TAITRA currently for the twin halls issue, The advantage for TWTC Nangang is exhibition spaces, but to the opposite way, traffic is surely a great headache for governments, organizers, and exhibitors. We still try to solve problems with this. Even though Computex Taipei will be located at TWTC Exhibition Hall and TWTC Nangang same time with the plan of TAITRA, but without solving problems, Computex Taipei will still be in a trouble even though we want to challenge the World's 1st scale against CeBIT.\nBrock: It's apparently that lots of organizations care about the traffic near TWTC Nangang. By the way, for the 1st time TCA holding 2007 IP Comm Asia, why should it be transformed from a long-historical trade show - Taipei Telecom by TAITRA, suspended from this year?\nEnoch: TCA explained some reasons for the transformation in the starting of 2007. In fact, lots of famous local participants (exhibitors) usually promoted their products with show-girls (models) so the quality of Taipei Telecom went from bad to worse in past 2 to 5 years. This is surely a damn bad demonstration in Taiwan's society. With suspending Taipei Telecom and promoting IP telecommunication industry in Taiwan, TCA finally decided to hold this professional trade show and named \"IP Comm Asia\" for the global market opportunity this year.\nBrock: Continued with \"IP Comm Asia\", how this show connect with \"2007 WiMAX Forum Taipei Showcase &amp; Conference\"?\nEnoch: Communication and networking (including WiMAX) industries should be complementaries. In Taiwan, IP telecommunication infrastructure shouldn't be looked down, with the trendy change of telecommunication industry, even though traditional telecommunication (fax and phone) industry is currently in a prior position, but IP telecommunication will be a new industry besides of communication and networking with computing technology. If consumers can communicate via Internet including Wi-Fi, its development will take advantage. Currently, some of telecommunication companies tried to change the quality of VoIP and experiment related applications for the market preparation, if the wireless network contained broadly and WiMAX infrastructure improved rapidly in Taiwan, I think that IP telecommunications will be the main stream in the future.\nBrock: Something interesting. Some of electronic trade shows held by TAITRA had a great transformation with combinations and changes such as a 3-in-1 show (TaiwanRFID, TAITRONICS, PV Taiwan) held past 2 weeks. Recently, TAITRA set \"Broadband Communications Pavilion\" at 2007 TAITRONICS Autumn to promote \"Broadband Taiwan 2008\" at TWTC Nangang and recruit companies with Taiwan Electrical and Electronic Manufacturers' Association. How the TCA think about this idea?\nEnoch: With trendy changes of electronic industry in Taiwan, several (electronic) trade shows suspended or transformed to other industry shows. As of TAITRA, they should fill up vacancies with some specified trade shows by some grown up industries. With their idea, they successfully transformed a simple electronic show to a grand combination with multiple industries' show. As you talked about the pavilion at TAITRONICS, this was a great chance for TAITRA to reposition and restart. Every show organizer always hopes their (international) show can keep good images for international buyers. Hope TWTC Nangang can bring a bright future and have a good start, and TAITRA can complete solutions for TWTC Nangang to keep TWTC Exhibition Hall in a steady position.\nBrock: Nice thanks. Hope I can visit some good shows by TCA.\nSummary.\nTCA surely worked hard with promoting IT industry by executing governmental plans and holding trade shows at TWTC or outside of Taiwan. That's why the IT industry in Taiwan can market to the world. TCA usually reposition some IT trade shows from quantity (factor) to quality with holding shows. Exhibition organizers in Taiwan should respect quality of exhibitions and conventions so that Taiwan can be visible world-wide in the future. With Du's words, if Computex Taipei should use twin halls, then TAITRA should solve the main issue of Nangang's traffic as Commissioner Luo said to keep them in a steady position, origins and quality."}

This article follows on from interviews with republican, Lewis Holden; and monarchist, Noel Cox.\nThe idea of libertarianism is where consent is required for all actions between people, and that these interactions are voluntary. Over four million people will be given freedom to run their own lives as Mr Milmine said. He says the Government doesn't follow this generally accepted principle. \"They take money without consent, order us around, and tell us what we can and cannot put in our bodies.\" Their party website states, \u201cWe will put paid to bloated government bureaucracy and its authoritarian inclinations.\u201d\nMr Darnton said that one of the biggest jobs of Libertarianz is to show New Zealanders how their lives could be better. \"Most parties complain when others steal their policies. We just smile and get on with the next thing.\" Libertarianz is, as Mr Milmine says, \u201cprincipled opposition to the idea of a large nanny-state government in New Zealand.\n\u201cA burglar stealing your TV is in the wrong because they are taking without permission. The government steals a proportion of your wealth every year, the fact that they allow a minor amount of input from you into how they are going to distribute the stolen loot does not change the fact that they stole it in the first place.\u201d\nMr Darnton also describes the current system of governance as a game. \u201cWhat's right or wrong doesn't really matter as long as the red team or the blue team or whoever is scoring more points. I think that's a terrible way to approach government.\"\nThe reason this political philosophy, underpinned by objectivism, isn't well accepted in the New Zealand culture is because New Zealanders are generally wary of major change, vote for the party they always have, and vote for the party they think will win, not the one they want to win, Mr Darton believes. \"These sorts of behaviour reinforce the big parties, even though neither have much to offer,\u201d Mr Darton said, \u201cWhat Libertarianz is proposing is something quite different to anything any other party is putting forward.\u201d Mr Milmine sees New Zealanders accepting libertarianism because, \u201cSlowly people see that the government doesn\u2019t solve their problems, it caused them in the first place.\u201d And when this is followed by a significant minority, Mr Milmine says, the change will happen very quickly.\nAlthough Mr Milmine does say that he cannot predict what will happen to New Zealand if it were to change to a libertarianism state, \"because it is asking me to predict the interactions of over four million people when they are given freedom to run their own lives.\"\nAs well as changing the system of Government, Libertarianz also propose New Zealand becoming a republic and removing the constitutional monarchy. Mr Darnton said, \u201cThe monarchy is so distant in New Zealand that I don't think becoming a republic would make a big difference in many people's lives.\u201d Mr Milmine says, \u201cA head of state has a valid role to play as a check on the power on the government, but it cannot perform this role if it is toothless.\u201d\nAlthough Mr Darnton believes that New Zealand will eventually become a republic, he is wary of making a push to it too quickly. He cites anti-prosperity and the governmental interference as issues that could make it into a written constitution and making it harder to shift later. While Mr Milmine says they would run into problems with people disagreeing with the Treaty of Waitangi if it were placed into a written constitution. But says a written constitution is needed, \u201cThere are examples of where [a written constitution] has worked and there are plenty of examples of the government ignoring the rights in our Bill of Rights because of the lack of a written constitution.\u201d\nAnd the final question asked to both Craig Milmine and Bernard Darnton was whether they were a Holden or a Ford fan. Mr Milmine said he preferred \u201cSubaru \u2013 I prefer the rallies \u2013 they allow more freedom\u201d while Mr Darnton bluntly said, \"No, I'm not.\""}

With this in mind he approached Howard Tayler, creator of the .\nTayler's response was not as McNeil expected, prompting a \"Wikinews\" investigation. Tayler refused to help the foundation raise money although he conceded that he does sometimes use the site. Instead he explained that some members of the webcomic community feel slighted by Wikipedia because over 50 articles on webcomics were deemed not to meet their notability guidelines and were deleted during January and February of 2007. Some members of the webcomics community considered this unacceptable. Whilst some of the comic related articles deleted did not qualify for inclusion in the encyclopedia under Wikipedia guidelines, the deletion of a large number of articles in such a short time period struck some webcomics writers and fans as a selective purge.\nMuch of the criticism has been focused on Wikipedia editor Dragonfiend, who has described notability as \"whether a topic has been noted by independent reputable sources\". She has said that \"If we include every article that anyone wants to write, then the encyclopedia becomes useless because nobody can find the actual needle of worthwhile information on a topic hidden in that hay stack of trivia.\" She has said Wikipedia should only have articles on webcomics like , , , and .\nThis deletion of numerous webcomic articles has not sat well with some in the webcomic community. editor and blogger Eric Burns has written that \"There are people -- and Dragonfiend is clearly one of them -- who are clearly going through Wikipedia looking for articles that should be weeded out as non-notable. and they're doing it in fields they clearly -- I mean, clearly -- have no interest, experience or knowledge.\" \n and writer Rob Balder has expressed similar viewpoints, calling the deletion of the webcomics articles a \"goddamned crime\" and describing a \"deletionist jihad\" by \"the politest bunch of book-burning assholes on the planet\". Balder also labelled \"\" as a form of \"naughtymancy\" magic in Erfworld. Deletionism refers to the Wikipedia ideology that favours relatively rigorous standards for maintaining access to articles, as opposed to which favours keeping and amending problematic articles.\nThere is concern among some webcomic groups that the notability guidelines are too rigorous for the typical webcomic. The standards usually require significant coverage in reliable sources that are independent of the subject, which is rare since even comics with dedicated followings do not always attract mainstream book publishers or reviews from mainstream journalists. It seems that this policy has alienated webcomic artists and fans and discouraged them from contributing to Wikipedia. \nConflicts such as this are not uncommon. Members of a Wikimedia Foundation mailing list pointed to other examples where the application of the rules has been perceived to be selective, leaving other communities disgruntled with a variety of Wikimedia projects, not just Wikipedia.

The Crimes (Repeal of Seditious Offences) Amendment Bill was passed by the New Zealand Parliament by an overwhelming majority of 114 to 7.\nSedition is the crime of inciting insurrection against the state. New Zealand's sedition law criminalised speech intended to \"bring into hatred or contempt\" or \"excite disaffection\" against the monarch or the government or to incite or encourage \"violence, lawlessness, or disorder\". The law had been widely criticised following the conviction of Timothy Selwyn in 2006 - the first sedition prosecution in 75 years - and repeal had been recommended by the New Zealand Law Commission.\nMinister of Justice Mark Burton criticised the law as an infringement on freedom of speech and a tool of political persecution - a view widely echoed by MPs from across the house. Green Party MP Keith Locke noted that \"the roll-call of those charged is a roll call of our political heroes\". However, New Zealand First MP Ron Mark advocated retaining the law in light of current fears about terrorism. New Zealand First was the only party to vote against the bill.\nThe bill repeals all seditious offences, and will come into effect on January 1, 2008."}

We have firmly established these moonlets exist in a relatively narrow region of the \"A\" ring, and the evidence indicates they are remnants of a larger moon that was shattered by a meteoroid or comet,\" said one of the researchers, Miodrag Sremcevic.\nThe Cassini spacecraft captures eight new propeller-like features within Saturn's A ring in what may be the propeller \"hot zone\" of Saturn's rings. Propeller features form around small moonlets that are not massive enough to clear out ring material, but are still able to pull smaller ring particles into a shape reminiscent of an airplane propeller. Scientists believe that propellers represent moonlet wakes, which are denser than the surrounding ring material and appear bright in the images. The length of the belt in which the moonlets were discovered is almost 2,000 miles long.\nScientists estimate that the size of the moon was relative to the size of Pan, the innermost moon of Saturn.

The news comes as Indonesian authorities announce they are pressing ahead with a possible prosecution.\nThe final report into the disaster, released on Monday, found that Komar, 45, had exhibited what was described as a \"fixation\" to land the plane, resulting in the excessively fast approach.\n\"If you look at his long flying experience, it's impossible that he would try to land at that speed,\" Captain Geraldus said, adding that marrital problems with wife Norma Andriani, a former air hostess, were \"common knowledge\". This was backed up by Dudi Sudibyo, an analyst at Angkasa magazine (translated: 'Airspace').\n\"I understand he was arguing with his wife until late that night,\" said Sudibyo, who went on to express concern at the lack of addressal of potential mental problems on the part of the pilot in the report. Sudibyo is himself a licensed pilot.\nLack of sleep may also have contributed. Both Komar and Gagam Rochmana, the flight's co-pilot, reported for duty at 4:30 a.m., with the flight departing Jakarta for Yogyakarta as scheduled at 6 a.m. \"What I want to know now is: why he didn't report that lack of sleep and ask to be shifted to the next flight, or maybe he felt extremely confident he could fly - overconfident,\" Sudibyo specualted. The report did not find any explicit evidence that they were unfit to fly, but did comment that \"they did not provide the investigation with information about (their) activities during the 72 hours prior to commencing duty\".\nPolice officials have commented that a prosecution is likely with the only personnel required to complete the case against the pilot and co-pilot being expert witnesses, and that the pilots had been grounded since the accident. \"We're looking to prosecute under criminal negligence causing death and serious injury,\" Inspector-General Adiwinoto said.\n\"We need witnesses who can prove there was negligence, and since this was an aviation matter, that could be someone from the National Safety Transportation Committee, or it could also be a medical doctor because of the deaths and injuries.\n\"We have been proceeding with this investigation all along, but we needed enough preliminary evidence, which we now do have, with the report that says, yes, there was human negligence.\" He also said that the airline may itself be prosecuted for failing to provide necessary training to the flight crew. This new development comes at the same time as six Garuda Boeing 737-400s are grounded for failure to comply with import regulations."}

When many did not, FEMA brought in agency officials to pose as fake reporters and ask questions. The option for reporters to call into the conference was also available, but the ones who did call in only got to listen to the press conference, and could not ask questions. No reporters were actually present during the conference, parts of which were carried live on \"Fox News\" and \"MSNBC\".\nDuring the briefing, FEMA employees asked Deputy Administrator Harvey Johnson a series of what \"The New York Times\" called \"decidedly friendly questions\" such as \"What type of commodities are you pledging to California?\", \"What lessons learned from Katrina have been applied?\" and \"Are you happy with FEMA's response so far?\". The briefing followed the format of a press conference, with FEMA's press secretary at one point cautioning that he would allow just \"two more questions\", then calling later for a \"last question\". Officials who posed as fake reporters included the deputy director of public affairs Cindy Taylor and Director of External Affairs John \"Pat\" Philbin. \nWhite House officials said that they do not condone FEMA's actions and also state that they had no idea that the conference was taking place.\n\"FEMA has issued an apology, saying that they had an error in judgment when they were attempting to get out a lot of information to reporters, who were asking for answers to a variety of questions in regard to the wildfires in California. It's not something I would have condoned. And they \u2014 I'm sure \u2014 will not do it again,\" said Dana Perino, the White House's press secretary in a statement.\nFEMA apologizes for the mishap and says that their intentions were only to get the information to the citizens of California.\n\"[The purpose was] to get information out as soon as possible, and in trying to do so we made an error in judgment. Our intent was to provide useful information and be responsive to the many questions we have received. We can and must do better,\" said Harvey E. Johnson, the agency's vice administrator. \"The real story -- how well the response and recovery elements are working in this disaster -- should not be lost because of how we tried to meet the needs of the media in distributing facts,\" a FEMA statement said.\nFEMA is currently deciding whether or not any officials should face punishment for the incident. One of the officials responsible, Pat Philbin, is going on to be the new head of public relations for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. \nThis is not the first time that the Bush administration has come under fire for planting reporters at press conferences. In February of 2005, White House reporter Jeff Gannon was accused of being planted to ask softball questions to President Bush. FEMA itself had earlier undergone criticism during Hurricane Katrina for using disaster workers for public relations in 2005."}

All 14 people on board were killed in the crash in September last year. \nGraham Knight, father of Sergeant Ben Knight, who died in the accident aged 25, told reporters that he had received internal RAF emails detailing prior concerns about the fuel leak problems on the Nimrod. One email originally sent on December 2, 2005 commented that \u201cXV230 [the tail number of the Nimrod that would go on to crash] has fuel-leak issues which need to be rectified before the aircraft can be deployed.\u201d Another, from February 2006, had the following to say: \u201cThe age of the airframe, combined with the aggressive tempo with which we are flying the jets in stark temperature shifts, is contributing to our leak headache.\u201d \nAnother email later the same month highlighted the serious nature of the problem: \u201cFuel leaks on the Nimrod MR2 aircraft now pose a significant threat to the force being able to meet commitments and operational tasking.\u201d \nThe emails were quietly forwarded to Knight, who has gone public with them via Sky News. \u201cI have evidence that a fuel leak caused the crash and the Service was fully aware of the risk months beforehand. I believe the RAF killed my son,\u201d he said.\nHe said that the emails were all written by senior members of the RAF, adding \u201cthere are so many people within the organisation who are not happy with what has been going on.\u201d\n\"The more I have dug, the deeper the conspiracy gets - essentially, I think the major failures have been down to communication problems.\"\nA board of inquiry has recently completed deliberating the cause of the accident, with a final report expected in about two weeks time. It is expected by many that the report will find a fuel leak was to blame. The crash was the largest loss of life from any UK service in a single incident since the Falklands war. Although the report will determine the cause of the crash and make recommendations to prevent it's recurrence, it will not attempt to establish blame for the disaster.\nThe Ministry of Defence (MoD) had previously admitted they were experiencing Nimrod fuel leaks, saying in January that in the six months proceeding there had been no less than 25 fuel leaks in RAF Nimrod aircraft. Nimrods were grounded after the crash, but were subsequently phased back into operation, and are currently back in full service flying regular reconnaissance missions in Afghanistan.\nThe MoD's response to these recent allegations was as follows: \"RAF Nimrod aircraft are designed and certified to strict airworthiness and safety standards. \n\"If we didn't have confidence in the aircraft, we would not continue to fly them. \n\"Nimrod has a good safety record and remains a potent and respected aircraft. \n\"The Board of Inquiry to establish the cause of the accident last September is continuing and it would be unhelpful to speculate on the outcome until the board's findings are published.\"\nAll 12 of the crewmembers on board were from 102 Squadron at RAF Kinloss, Scotland. The loss was so large as in to have an adverse affect on the air base. The other two personnel on board were a marine and a solider.\n\"An aircraft should not suddenly burst into a ball of flames in mid-air,\u201d Knight commented. He has been conducting his own investigation based on documentation obtained under the Freedom of Information Act. One important document is a recommendation made by BAE Systems in 2004 following a safety audit that concluded that it would be impossible to extinguish a fire on a Nimrod. The recommendation was to install a fire detection system. It was never acted upon.\nSources.\n "}

I'd say, 'Go ahead. Make my day.'\"\nFew reporters will ever reach the stature of Talese. His 1966 profile of Frank Sinatra, \"Frank Sinatra Has a Cold\", was not only cited by \"The Economist\" as the greatest profile of Sinatra ever written, but is considered the greatest of any celebrity profile ever written. In the 70th anniversary issue of \"Esquire\" in October 2003, the editors declared the piece the \"Best Story Esquire Ever Published.\"\nTalese helped create and define a new style of literary reporting called New Journalism. Talese himself told National Public Radio he rejects this label (\"The term new journalism became very fashionable on college campuses in the 1970s and some of its practitioners tended to be a little loose with the facts. And that's where I wanted to part company.\") \nHe is not bothered by the Bancrofts selling \"The Wall Street Journal\"\u2014\"It's not like we should lament the passing of some noble dynasty!\"\u2014to Rupert Murdoch, but he is bothered by how the press supported and sold the Iraq War to the American people. \"The press in Washington got us into this war as much as the people that are controlling it,\" said Talese. \"They took information that was second-hand information, and they went along with it.\" He wants to see the Washington press corp disbanded and sent around the country to get back in touch with the people it covers; that the press should not be so focused on--and in bed with--the federal government. \nAugusten Burroughs once said that writers are experience junkies, and Talese fits the bill. Talese--who has been married to Nan Talese (she edited James Frey's \"Million Little Piece\") for fifty years--can be found at baseball games in Cuba or the gay bars of Beijing, wanting to see humanity in all its experience.\nBelow is \"Wikinews\" reporter David Shankbone's interview with Gay Talese. \nOn Gay Talese.\nDavid Shankbone: Does it bother you that your name has come to mean 'homosexual'? \n\"'DS: [\"Laughs\"] \"Sports Gay-zing\"?\nDS: Is your ancestry Sicilian or Northern?\nDS: Southern, not Sicilian?\nDS: Do you ever pay any attention to Italian politics and the happenings with the Lega Nord?\nDS: They can't seem to do anything politically.

I think Iran is another good example, where we are consistently fed images and notions about a people and a culture that aren't really accurate.\nDS: Or fair minded. But the reality is far more interesting than the same stories we are consistently fed.\nDS: And Americans are the donkeys as well?\nDS: But people are still consuming what they're throwing out there though.\nDS: It's dangerous to actually go out there and hit the pavement. \nDS: How could there not be?\nDS: Sure.\nDS: Have you been there?\nDS: Why haven't you?\nDS: That shouldn't be too hard for you.\n\"'DS: \"Esquire\"?\n\"'DS: \"Esquire\" does political reporting.\nDS: What would be the difficulties for you in achieving that?

It's a top 25 law school in a very vibrant city with a lot of thinkers. I told this anecdote to Floyd Abrams: I was in a Constitutional Law class right after Alito was nominated to be on the Supreme Court. The professor asked 120 law students on the first day of class how many of them thought he should be confirmed. About five students raised their hands. \"New York,\" I thought. Then he asked how many of them thought Alito should \"not\" be confirmed. About ten students raised their hands. Then he asked how many did not feel they had enough information to know. about another five students raised their hands. What is that? 100 students in a Constitutional Law class at a top school can't proffer an opinion on a Supreme Court nominee? Is that apathy...confusion...fear...? What is it?\nDS: After Hurricane Katrina there was a lot of debate on whether we would rebuild one of our own cities as we were over in Iraq demolishing their cities. How did you feel about that?\nDS: Yeah, the high areas; the rich areas--\nDS: More than it used to be?\nDS: Every year you go to Selma?

Nobody laughed, because they were all coming from the same place.\nDS: Because nobody reported about it, or they just said he bombed. Then it went out on the internet and took on a life of its own and people said, \"This isn't bombing, this a roasting of the entire power structure and the power structure decided they didn't like it.\"\nDS: A view of the federal government from the national scene? \"Here in Denver the reaction to Washington...\"\nDS: Reporting?\nDS: The way it is now, they don't get an interview with so-and-so if they write something, or they don't get to go to someone's party!\nDS: Do you think Bob Woodward is still an intrepid Washington reporter? He's often been accused of being too close to the people he covers.\nOn travel to Cuba.\nDS: When I was in my teens and early twenties my travels were very Europe-centric. But as an adult I have been drawn to places either seemingly \"dangerous\" to me or places that I don't feel like I know because I've read so much about them or seen so often in books and magazines. So Europe is off my map now, though I did sneak into Cuba.\nDS: In 2002.\nDS: Through the Caymans Islands.\nDS: Just took a flight on Aero Caribbean. Now they've stopped using the dollar. But back then, they were very much encouraging American tourists to come via Mexico.\nDS: 2002.\nDS: They stopped using the dollar.\nDS: You have the Cuban pesos. \n\"'DS: I'm not really sure now because when I was there they had the system where you could actually just use dollars. That's what we used. The local currency was called \"pesos convertibles\" that were convertible into dollars. Of course they have no value anywhere else in the world except in Cuba, but then they stopped doing that. Castro has kind of created Batista's society in some ways; not in every way. The poor are certainly a lot better off than they were under Batista. But with the embargo, the economy is now very tourist-based, which creates this tourist class. We didn't stay in the hotels. We wanted to stay in what they call \"casa particulars\" and I remember talking to a woman who made $30 a month as a doctor. But running this \"casa particular\", she was making around $300, $500 a month, which made her very rich.\nDS: Like a rooming house. Exactly.\nDS: That's probably the best analogy. Staying at those the money goes more to the people. The other thing they tell you when you go to Cuba is to bring aspirin and all these things that are in short supply there. The people who run these Bed and Breakfasts, if you will, make out with all the stuff the tourists give them to be dispersed in their communities. I went to Ecuador. I went camping in the Amazon. These are the places that interest me now. Do you find it similar in your own travels to really seek out things underneath, to pull up rocks and try and find places off the beaten path. Going to Timbuktu or wherever. Do you have a travel philosophy?\nDS: And talk to the people.\nDS: And a happy society. At least I found a lot of people who were very content. They may not have an easy life, but they were quite content.\nDS: People dancing in the streets at night.\nDS: And friendly.\nDS: My friend I was with was Colombian from Miami, and he made the exact same observation. He had a prejudice against Cubans from his time in Miami and he said, \"These people aren't anything like the Cubans in Miami.\"\nOn Chinese gay bars.\nDavid Shankbone: Do you have a favorite country you have visited?\nDS: You talk about China a lot.\nDS: Is it interesting to you to watch China change?\nDS: Do you get tired of going to the same region and then you're like, \u2018I need to go to Asia for a while?'\nDS: I haven't been to Asia. It doesn't particularly interest me all that much. There are countries I would like to see, Cambodia being one. South America is one of the areas that I am most interested to explore because I speak Spanish.\nDS: What are the gay bars like?\nDS: Are they flamboyant?\nDS: It's because they kill them.\nDS: How did you get introduced to a gay bar in Beijing?\nDS: Including the European ones, right? English is the international language.\nDS: And it's so basic.\nOn the literary canon.\n\"'DS: I spoke with a young novelist named John Reed. He wrote a book called \"Snowball's Chance\" that was an attack on Orwell and we were talking about the literary canon that's taught in grade school and high school. He raised an interesting idea that I wanted to run by you. His point was that kids are not becoming readers. So much of what they learn with books and reading doesn't seem applicable to their lives. I read in \"Newsweek\" that your five favorite novels and there was a lot of classics \u2013 \"The Scarlet Letter\", \"The Great Gatsby\", things like that. Reed's point was that kids have a hard time bonding with these materials. What should be taught at those levels is modern literature. At the more senior levels, once they've developed acumen for reading and they relate to it on a personal level, then they'll go exploring the classics and it's almost more pertinent to them being able to understand it. An analogy would be as if you had children and they only watched Bette Davis and Joan Crawford movies and then the film genre would wither because young people found it difficult to relate to it. What do you think about that idea?\nDS: Not kids.\nDS: That's a phenomenon. It's not really that typical; I mean, it stands out because it's a billion dollar author.\nDS: And they can't say certain things.\nDS: Would you agree with the idea that children don't grow up reading much anymore, outside of what's required?\nDS: You're saying that there never was really a time when people read more unless they had cause to read a lot based upon their circumstances?\nDS: Is that who you were reading at that age?\n\"'DS: I've read \"The Plot Against America\"."}

We've had at least two reports of a new star. When the Deep Impact probe hit Comet 9P Tempel, there was almost no change in brightness. This outburst by Comet Holmes is extreme!\" said Minor Planet Center director, Brian Marsden.\nNot more than a few days ago, the comet began to get brighter and appear larger in the sky, in what scientists call an \"outburst.\" The comet is usually only visible through telescopes, but the outburst has caused it to be visible through the naked eye and it will continue to grow brighter with its coma eventually reaching the size of The Moon. Currently, only people living in the Northern Hemisphere are able to get a glimpse of the show. Binoculars and a small telescope can be used to get a close up view.\nThe comet took just 24 hours to get more than 400,000 times brighter than it usually is, and is currently over one million times brighter, but Marsden says the comet's brightness could dim in days or even weeks.\nThe comet was discovered on November 6, 1892 by Edwin Holmes while he was looking at the Andromeda Galaxy through his telescope. Researchers say that the comet may also have had an outburst at the time it was discovered. It was seen once after that in 1899 and then 1906, but disappeared until it was \"rediscovered\" in 1964 after a prediction Marsden had made.\n\"Since then, it\u2019s been behaving well \u2013 until now,\" added Marsden."}

Alberta premier Ed Stelmach, Calgary mayor Dave Bronconnier, and other public officials were there. \"Congratulations on winning a third term. As a three-term prime minister I can tell you that's when things get rough,\" Blair told Bronconnier.\nDuring the speech he talked about Canada on the world stage, the controversial military role in Afghanistan, defending the country in war-devastated places, as well as other large issues facing Canada.\nBlair said it's not about being on the left or right side of politics, it's about being open or closed.\n\"If we want to win, we can't just be for democracy and freedom. We have to be for justice and fairness,\" Blair said to the audience that paid CA$400 to attend the event. \"It's a battle of ideas.\"\n\"If we're going to fight this terrorism off, we're going to have to show them we're as tough as they are ... and stay the course.\" Blair said even though it'll be a long-road in the war it's important to not give up the fight against \"the forces of extremism.\"\nBlair is an Envoy in the Quartet on the Middle East, which is involved in mediating the peace process in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

I'm still adjusting.\"\nHe also commented about Alberta's oil and gas royalty dispute saying, \"I'm just glad it's not my decision,\" and after three terms of being PM he's \"learned when to keep my mouth shut.\" Alberta has the second largest oil reserves in the world and Abu Dhabi National Energy Co. recently made their third offer for $5-billion to buy Alberta-based company Prime West Energy Trust. In relation to that, Blair said, \"Calgary is not only the new centre of Canada or North America, but a global centre for the world.\"\n\"I often say to people, Canada will become one of the most powerful nations in the world.\" He also pointed out, \"As power grows... so does more responsibility. What you need to do is carry with it your optimistic spirit.

That is why, in the Speech from the Throne, we committed to introducing legislation to confirm the visual identification of voters,\" said Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Peter Van Loan. \"Today, with the introduction of this Bill, we have fulfilled that commitment.\"\n\"While there was no apparent case of fraud in the recent Quebec by-elections, it was widely reported that numerous individuals voted while purposefully concealing their face,\" said Member of Parliament Lawrence Cannon. \"This caused people to question the credibility and integrity of the voting process. In a democratic system, it is crucial that confidence in our democracy be maintained. This Bill will maintain that confidence.\"\nMuslims will need to uncover when voting at all federal elections, by-elections, and advance polls. Citizens who are vouching for a voter who doesn't have an ID will have to uncover their face as well. People who are medically required to have their faces covered are given an exception but will need to show photo ID and two pieces of other ID, or they will have to be vouched for by someone, who is not wearing a face covering, or removes their face covering. Alternatively they can make an oath saying it would be against the rules of their doctor or be harmful to their health to remove their face covering.\nElections Canada volunteers would need to, somehow, suit the voter to their religious needs, if necessary.\nAccording to the press release it will allow \"someone to be recognized, who is attempting to commit an offense at the polls (e.g. someone trying to vote twice),\" and it will \"restore public confidence in the electoral process.\"\nBill C-31 allowed voters to wear veils as long as they showed two pieces of ID, with one displaying their address. If they only brought one piece, photo ID or not, they would be required to remove their veils. If the person had a voting card, the problem would not exist. However, the new proposed bill would require Muslims to remove their veil regardless of if they have a voting card.\nThe Chief Electoral Officer for Elections Quebec refused to come to agreement with the Federal Government's opposition of his position of letting voters only remove their veils when they only brought one photo and no other ID, so they could compare their identity to the photo. He could have supported the Federal Government's opposition and change the requirements, but since he didn't the Canada Elections Act has been proposed to be amended.\n\"If anybody had actually bothered to ask the women that are actually concerned, and we are talking about a very small minority of women, they would have told them that they always take it off to identify their faces. And they do it at the bank, they do it at border crossings, they do it at the airport,\" said Sarah Elgazzar, a spokeswoman for the Canada Council on American-Islamic Relations in September."}

Governors General Micha\u00eblle Jean will meet with him at her Rideau Hall residence, followed by a meet with Liberal MPs at a hotel on Tuesday.\nThis is the second time the Dalai Lama will meet with a Canadian Prime Minister. Former Foreign Affairs Minister Peter Mackay and the PM made a controversial move and appointed the Dalai Lama honorary Canadian citizenship in June 2006. Jason Kenney, who visited the house of former Communist party chief Zhao Ziyang in China, and accidentally went to a rally supporting the People's Mujahedin of Iran, was instrumental in granting him honorary citizenship. Paul Martin later criticised him for visiting the home. Kenney is a member of the Canada-Tibet Committee.\nFormer Liberal Canadian PM Paul Martin met with the Dalai Lama at a Roman Catholic archbishop's house, showing he respected the figure but there were some wide religious differences. Harper is also a Catholic.\nTwo weeks before, U.S. President George W. Bush met with the famous religious figure, which sparkled up controversy from the Chinese government. He is the first sitting U.S. president to appear with the Dalai Lama in public.\n\"I think what some of these countries are now seeing is that the changes that were promised in China have not happened at a fast enough rate, and that the Dalai Lama's travels are an opportunity for those countries to continue the exertion on China for democratic reform and better protection of human rights,\" said executive director of the Canada-Tibet Committee, Dermod Travis.\n\"China is not looking very good in all this. They're coming across as bullies. China can send out these press releases, but I don't believe they'll stop doing business with all these countries,\" said Consiglio Di Nino, a Canadian senator, who is co-chairman of the Parliamentary Friends of Tibet, and was instrumental in organising the visit.\n\"Whoever this young man was he had taken a tremendous risk.

Held at the Aristo centre in a suburb of the city and run by Wikimedia Netherlands, the conference was a short train ride from Amsterdam Centraal railway station. The topic, Wikis and Education (\"Wiki's en Educatie\" in Dutch). This was an opportunity for Wikimedians and people in education to come together and see how collaboration could help both.\n\"Wikinews\" freelance reporter caught a train from Brussels in Belgium and attended, making an impression on the Wikimedia Foundation chair, Florence Devouard, by spilling her coffee over the first two speakers approximately three minutes before they were supposed to officially open the conference.\nMorning sessions.\nKicking off at 10:00 a.m., the opening speaker was Elly Waterman, chair of Wikimedia Netherlands. The introduction was a mixture of Dutch and English, with Elly commenting on how Wikimedia, or more specifically Wikipedia, is gaining increasing coverage in mainstream press. Not all this coverage is positive, one anecdotal case was a town mayor being described as \"boring\" in the Dutch Wikipedia. Unfortunately, this made headline news in one of the country's papers. \nFollowing Elly was the Wikimedia Foundation's chair, Florence Devouard. Her speech was on \"The Wiki Potential for Education\". One of her slides referred to \"Living in exponential times\", a sound bite that encapsulates the explosive growth of available information as well as the computing power to sift through and process it. This was a new presentation with a video used a number of times in the past, but as Florence admitted she deviates from the script and rewrites parts a day or two before giving her presentation. At an early stage in her presentation, she pulled up a photo from Wikimania 2007, highlighting a couple of people huddled over laptops and unwilling to leave the virtual world long enough to look into the camera. Following this those with laptops were requested to close them and stand up, the attendees then were told to introduce themselves to each other. Later on, a prolonged period speaking caused Florence's laptop to start up its screensaver, revealing the more human side with pictures of her children, and some of her favourites from Wikimedia Commons.\nAfter a brief recess for coffee, and trips outside for those with a nicotine addiction, the conference split into a number of talks. Cormac Lawler, from the University of Manchester in the United Kingdom, introduced the Wikimedia Foundation's youngest project, Wikiversity. Cormac, who is writing his PhD thesis on Wikiversity discovered the Wikipedia project about three years ago and was fascinated. He described how Wikiversity was initially incubated within the Wikibooks project and properly launched in August 2006, like Wikinews there is scope for original research, but as was admitted this is not yet clearly defined. Lengthy discussion has taken place within the Wikiversity project, a distillation of that can be found here, in the . In delving further into how Wikiversity may end up working, Cormac highlighted one aspect of online resources which differs from hardcopy. An axiom of all projects is \"wiki is not paper\", so despite the \"versity\" suffix that most people will assume means tertiary level material, an online resource can cover everything - right down to how to paint your house.\nIn parallel with Cormac's talk, the first lightning ten minute talks session was given, speakers included Walter Vermeir who spoke on the topic of Wikimedia Stewards, and Harm Dillen who discussed the competition for MediaWiki, the software used for Wikipedia and its sister projects. Another room held Erwin Kroekenstoel's presentation about the , a special server which is used to write software to automate wiki editing and analysis tasks. Erwin's session was shared with Bryan Tong Minh speaking about MediaWiki. An extended session kicked off in room D, a workshop on MediaWiki.\nAfter another coffee break for all but those in the workshop, a set of Dutch-only presentations were given; \"Creative Commons while in school\" by Martijn Arnoldus and \"practical applications of a school wiki\" by Dries Declercq. Room B saw Inge Habex giving a presentation on Wikibooks, with Walter Vermeir giving a presentation entitled \"A Wikimedia Community? Conquering Babel\", about the difficulties of communication between Wikimedia-communities. There have been some initiatives, like the and the , the success of which, however, has been limited.\nAfternoon.\nLunch was followed by three sessions running in tandem. A shorter MediaWiki workshop was held again in room D, Merlijn van Deen spoke on pywikipediabot, and the main room held Eliane Metini's talk, \"The Global educators' Open course\". Eliane is the director of the International Education association, a Lebanese NGO. She is also chair of iEARN (International Education And Resource Network). She discussed at length the challenges of preparing both students and tomorrow's teachers for the 21st century. Bob Hoffman from the Netherlands also spoke briefly, one of Eliane's colleagues on the project. iEARN has been running for 20 years, and is active in 115 countries.\nAfter the last keynote speech by Eliane, the three-track program continued with sessions going more into the education. Presentors from the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam and the Radboud University of Nijmegen explained how they used the Wiki in their education as a tool in room A, and in room B the focus was on how Kennisnet, a Dutch NGO focusing on internet in education, is using Wiki's in it's projects, why Kennisnet is so involved with Wiki's and the Wikimedia projects, and WikiKids, a Dutch website where kids write together on an encyclopedia for kids. At the same time, in room C the second session of the Lightning Talks started, including a presentation about Wikinews, Jurispedia, Wikipedia in study books and Wikimedia Commons.\nOne of the latest sessions was about using the wiki-module in Moodle, presented by Hans de Zwart. Moodle is an open source program to structure learning. It can also use wikis in such a way that students can work on reports or assignments on one or more wikis specially created during and for this course (even per student). OpenUniversity have adopted Moodle for their courses and will add a more suiting wiki (non MediaWiki) as of the 1.9 versions of Moodle. At the same time, in room B, Delphine M\u00e9nard was explaining the true meaning of 'free' and Cormac Lawler explained more thoroughly what Wikiversity actually is. In room C Finne Boonen and Kim Bruning explained more about the technical infrastructure behind Wikimedia, and Gerard Meijssen explained what Wikidata is all about in a more technical session.\nFinally the conference was ended by a grand discussion, involving all attendees and led by former board member Oscar van Dillen. The discussion was a wrap-up of the whole conference, which was very well visited with roughly 110 visitors from the Wikimedia Communities, the Dutch educational sector and other interested people. This has been a major increase compared with the 2006 conference, which drew 45 attendees. An evaluation will follow soon."}

There are several variants of the disease but type 1 and type 2 NF account for the vast majority of cases.\nThe disease manifestations can vary from very mild to severe. Major symptoms include growths on and under the skin; skin pigmentations called caf\u00e9 au lait spots in type 1; acoustic nerve tumors and consequent hearing loss in type 2. Growths can affect nearly all parts of the body, and pressure on nearby structures can cause a wide variety of complications. There is a small risk that the tumors transform into malignant cancerous lesions.\nNF is one of the most common single-gene human diseases; around 1 in 2,500-4,000 live births are affected by NF-1, whereas NF-2 occurs in about 1 in 50,000-120,000. Both type 1 and 2 are autosomal dominant conditions, meaning that only one copy of the mutated gene need be inherited to pass the disorder. A child of a parent with neurofibromatosis and an unaffected parent will have a 50% chance of inheriting the disorder. The gene responsible for NF-1 and possibly NF-2 is thought to function as a tumor suppressor gene.\nIn most cases of neurofibromatosis 1, patients can live normal and productive lives. In about 25-40% of patients there is an associated learning disability with or without ADHD. In some cases of neurofibromatosis 2, the damage to nearby vital structures, such as the cranial nerves and the brainstem, can be life-threatening. When tumors are causing pain or disfiguration, surgery is thus far the only proven beneficial treatment option.\nReggie Bibbs is a 43-year-old-man living in Houston, Texas. Mr Bibbs was born with a genetic disease called neurofibromatosis (NF), which causes him to develop tumors on his body (see infobox on the right). NF can be a subtle disease, but in Bibbs' case it has left him with a disfigured face and deformed leg. But he is happy with the way he looks, and doesn't want to change his appearance to please other people. He has launched a successful campaign entitled \"Just Ask\", and that's just what \"Wikinews\" did in a video-interview.\nThe interview was prepared by \"Wikinews\" reporter with the help of Bertalan Mesk\u00f3 (who has a popular genetics and web 2.0 blog).

Chase immediately took action by contacting \"NBC\" executives, who are charge of the debate.\nThe letter was sent and it includes an explanation as to why \"NBC\" should not censor Gravel, and also holds an offer of US$1 million to include Gravel. The US$1 million offer could be given to \"NBC\" in exchange for allowing the senator to participate in the 2-hour debate, by either Chase purchasing a million dollars worth of advertising space on their network, donating the million to \"NBC's\" favorite charity, or giving the million dollars to \"NBC's\" parent company, General Electric.\nThe decision made by Chase to give the million dollars to \"NBC\" is due to criteria that Gravel did not meet, which includes the following; having campaigned in New Hampshire and/or Iowa at least 14 times in the past year, not polling high enough in national polls, and Sen. Gravel's campaign had not raised more than US$1 million.\nAccording to the \"Gravel for President\" campaign, Gravel reportedly visited either New Hampshire or Iowa at least 14 times since his announcement on April 17, 2006, and according to a recent poll by \"CNN\", Gravel is tied with fellow candidates Rep. Dennis Kucinich, Sen. Joe Biden, and Sen. Chris Dodd and 1% behind Gov. Bill Richardson.\nThe fundraising requirement is the only criteria not achieved.\nBelow is the letter in full that was sent to \"NBC\" and Democratic National Committee executives.\nAs of October 26, 2007, Chase has not received a response from \"NBC\" regarding the offer."}

If this would be the case, 'Cristina' would win the elections in the first round, as the Argentinian electoral law states that to win the elections, someone has to obtain more than 40% of votes, and the difference with the next candidate has to be over 10%. The exit polls say the in the province of Buenos Aires, Daniel Scioli has gained more than half of votes.\nVoting started this morning at 08:00 local time, and Cristina Kirchner was the favourite candidate to succeed her husband, current President of Argentina N\u00e9stor Kirchner, who decided not to run for a second four-year term, without giving any explanation. Mrs Kirchner consistently used her first name during her electoral campaign, just like Hillary Clinton does in the United States. Clinton is also a lawyer and a senator wanting to succeed her husband as President. But Cristina replied recently: \"I don't want to be compared with Hillary Clinton or with Evita Per\u00f3n, or with anybody... There's nothing better than being yourself.\"\nMrs Kirchner's husband is very popular because of the successful economic reforms after the economy collapsed six years ago. The current President oversaw steep reductions in poverty and unemployment rates. This was the reason for Cristina's campaign slogan, \"Sabemos como hacerlo\", 'we know how to do it.' However, accusations of corruption have emerged during the last year, and rising inflation rates are becoming problematic, while there are concerns that the government's inflation statistics are flawed. Crime rates have also been a key campaign issue.\nSeveral voting offices had long waiting times and voting was extended for one hour until 19:00 local time (UTC 16:00). There were also various protests because of the lack of voting forms. A spokesperson for candidate Roberto Lavagna, who might become third in the Presidential race, said there was a \"systematic lack\" of voting forms. Anibal Fern\u00e1ndez, Minister of the Interior, said that this was the responsibility of the provincial authorities.\nWhile voting, Mrs Kirchner told the press how important the right to vote was for her, in a reference to the military dictatorship of 1976-1983. \"When I was 18 I couldn't vote, so this [voting] is very important... It's important that in the tranquility of democracy, citizens can decide in what kind of country they want to live,\" Mrs Kirchner said.\nEight new provincial governors and new members for half the parliament and a third of the senate will also be elected today."}

Bait was used to attract animals which consisted of a \"aromatic deer attractant\" and various mineral in the form of a block that the deer would lick.

Those people include gays, Nazis, women seeking abortion, gun owners, mailers and drug users. People who are often not popular with various segments of the public. The ACLU's philosophy is not that it agrees or disagrees with any of these people and the choices that they make, but that they have personal liberties that must not be trampled upon. \nIn \"Wikinews\" reporter 's interview with the President of the ACLU, Nadine Strossen, he wanted to cover some basic ground on the ACLU's beliefs. Perhaps the area where they are most misunderstood or have their beliefs most misrepresented is their feelings about religion in the public sphere. The ACLU categorically does not want to see religion disappear from schools or in the public forum; but they do not want to see government advocacy of any particular religion. Thus, former Alabama Chief Justice Roy Moore's placement of a ten ton monument to the Ten Commandments outside the courthouse is strenuously opposed; but \"Lone Ranger of the Manger\" Rita Warren's placement of nativity scenes in public parks is vigorously defended. In the interview, Strossen talks about how certain politicians and televangelists purposefully misstate the law and the ACLU's work in order to raise funds for their campaigns.\nDavid Shankbone's discussion with Strossen touches upon many of the ACLU's hot button issues: religion, Second Amendment rights, drug liberalization, \"partial-birth abortion\" and whether or not George W. Bush should be impeached. It may surprise the reader that many ideas people have about the most visible of America's civil libertarian organizations are not factually correct and that the ACLU often works closely with many of the organizations people think despise its existence.\nStrossen's background.\nDavid Shankbone: Why did you want to be an attorney?\nDS: Why?\nDS: What family experiences?\nDS: What were you taught about him?\nDS: When you went to Harvard, were you an activist on campus?\nDS: What would you say the atmosphere was like on campus back then, with all the issues that were being contended with, how would you describe it?\nReligion in schools.\nDS: You had mentioned that one of the things that affected you with your family was seeing points of view not being allowed to be expressed. Many religious conservatives would say that the ACLU opposes having their points of view in the schools. How would you respond?\nDS: So there isn\u2019t any opposition to having religious groups meeting inside of public schools?\nDS: Would you defend someone\u2019s right to have a religious meeting in a public school?\nReligious symbols.\nDS: The ACLU has been involved in removing religious symbology from the public forum. Can you state your views on that?\nDS: Can you give an example of a religious symbology case where the ACLU supported religious freedom?\nHow the ACLU is misrepresented by politicians and televangelists.\nDS: Do people misconstrue or misunderstand your work and what you have argued for or against?\nDS: \u2014and the ACLU said\u2014\nDS: \u2014Roy Moore?\nDS: When does a symbol become historical and when is it intrinsically religious? For instance, a community that was once a mission and they have had a large cross on a mountaintop that to them is more historical marker.\nDS: Well, two years.\nDS: Almost a slave.\n\"'DS: Yes, 3/5ths! [\"Laughs\"]\nDS: That\u2019s always the problem in law: who is that reasonable observer? Someone from the community, someone who has just moved into the community?\nDS: Going back to when you have debated religious conservatives and they make the charge that what the ACLU is working toward is no religion in schools, and you can\u2019t have a prayer group, do you think there is a conscious motivation to misrepresent what you have done and want, or is it a misunderstanding?\nThe abortion debate.\n\"'DS: Don\u2019t you think the way both sides go about engaging each other harms America? Take the partial-birth abortion Supreme Court case. Did you read Justice Stevens' \"New York Times\" interview with Jeff Rosen?\nDS: He said it was a silly decision that wasn\u2019t particularly important\u2014\nDS: Yes. He said it was, in the end, not a particularly important case.\nDS: He was talking about in terms of the effect, that it didn\u2019t have much of an effect because there were other legal alternatives to that particular method of abortion.\nDS: The question I have is that on its face it was deciding one particular issue in the abortion debate, but a lot of pro-choice organizations paint this as, \u201cWe are now getting ready to ban abortion; this is the first step on what might be a short road\u2014\u201c\nDS: Yes, a slippery slope. Isn\u2019t it almost the same thing when the evangelicals say, \u201cThey are coming for your prayer, your kids aren\u2019t going to be able to pray or allow God in schools.\u201d\nDS: Is it healthy for us to be ringing these alarm bells every time one nuance in the argument gets addressed?\n\"'DS: But let\u2019s say the Christians give you that, and they say, \u201cThis is just the first step and what they ultimately want is not to have the word God said \"anywhere\" in the public square.\u201d\n\"'DS: Whereas in the abortion argument it is a stated goal to bring about the end of \"Roe v. Wade\".\nJudicial activism.\nDS: When you hear the phrase \u201cjudicial activism\u201d what comes to your mind?\nDS: So you believe in the living Constitution?\nDS: \u201cThese are cruel and unusual punishments\u201d\nDS: Do you think there is a right to privacy in the Constitution?\nCapital punishment and criminal justice.\n\"'DS: What argument for capital punishment do you think is \"most\" compelling for it?\nDS: The criminal justice system is a rehabilitative system?\nDS: Is that what it should be?\nDS: How does it do that?\nDecriminalization of drugs and suicide.\nDS: Are you an active member of NORML?\nDS: Do you believe in the decriminalization of marijuana? \nDS: Can you give me your case for that?\nDS: Should suicide be legal?\nDS: So how would you like to die?\nDS: You wouldn\u2019t want a Terri Schiavo situation?\nDS: So you have the choice, what is your choice?\nWar and threats to humanity.\nDS: What do you think is the greatest threat to humanity right now?\nDS: However you interpret the question.\nDS: How has the Iraq War affected your world view?\nDS: Have you seen a precipitous drop?\nDS: Ahmadinejad came to Columbia and brought that argument up.\nDS: It\u2019s surprising that Hagel gave that criticism since it is his party that has instituted the fear of government into our culture. Such as Reagan\u2019s famous line that the most terrifying words in the English language are, \u201cI\u2019m from the government and I\u2019m here to help.\u201d\nDS: When I interviewed Gay Talese, I asked him how the Iraq War affected him and he said it had not. He said, \u201cI wish it did!\u201d He said he doesn\u2019t feel anything and that he doesn\u2019t think anyone else does, either. He feels you can\u2019t have a war affect people unless you have conscription.\nDS: But they see it as voluntary service. It\u2019s a voluntary army.\nDS: --That\u2019s what Talese said. Senator Brownback told me he is against conscription, and it\u2019s interesting that the people who are most for the war are the people who are most for a voluntary army. \nDS: Rangel\u2019s bent is that if people were actually fighting in the wars, or forced to fight, that it would bring public opinion against the war.\nShould George Bush be impeached?\nDS: Do you think George Bush should be impeached?\nDS: You just don\u2019t think it would be productive.\nGun rights.\nDS: Where do you stand on the Second Amendment and the rights of gun owners? Are the rights accorded to well-armed militias, or is it accorded to unfettered rights of individuals to own guns?\nStrossen's philosophy.\nDS: Last question: what trait do you deplore in people?\n\"'DS: That\u2019s about the best answer I can think of coming from the President of the ACLU! [\"Laughs\"]\nDS: That you deplore in people.\nDS: Do you deplore any in yourself?"}

The other three are journalists, there to cover the \"rescue.\"\nThe prosecutor in Ab\u00e9ch\u00e9, Ahmat Daoud, said: \"For the nine French people it is a matter of kidnapping of minors...as well as extortion.\" They face 20 years in prison if convicted.\n\"Zoe's Ark\" describes the children as orphans and says that they would have a better life in Europe. \"The team is made up of firemen, doctors and journalists,\" said spokesperson, Christophe Letien, at a news conference. \"It's unimaginable that doubts are being cast on these people of good faith, who volunteered to save children from Darfur.\" However, French news agency CAPA published an interview in which a \"Zoe's Ark\" member said they could not be completely sure the children were orphans in need of help.\nAccording to Annette Rehrl, spokesperson for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, few of the children appear to actually be orphans. \"They keep saying that they want to return to their parents. Most of them are between three and six years old. It\u2019s very difficult to ask three-year-olds their names and where they come from. Also, some children have already changed their names and stories,\" Rehrl said.\nFrench officials say that they warned the group against this operation for months. \"Zoe's Ark\" offices in France were searched to see if the group broke French adoption law by promising families that they could adopt and not just host the children.\nThe President of Chad, Idriss D\u00e9by, says that it is a case of \"kidnap, pure and simple.\" He further suggested that \"Zoe's Ark\" may have sought to supply the children to pedophile rings or use them as donors for organ transplant.\nThe European Union is about to deploy a peacekeeping force, which includes French soldiers, along the border between Chad and Sudan. D\u00e9by has assured his French counterpart, Nicolas Sarkozy, he will not attempt to block the EU troops."}

Tavera-Mendoza and John H. White, Vitamin D intake may also be beneficial in the prevention of cancer, multiple sclerosis, diabetes, and fighting tuberculosis, influenza and inflammatory bowel disease. The researchers say that there is an emerging \"widespread consensus\" among experts that a large part of the population has levels of Vitamin D in their bodies that is well below optimal concentrations for health, particularly in temperate regions, due to decreased sunlight and or less time outdoors, and during or just after the winter months. One study indicated that as many as 92% of adolescent girls in Northern Europe may have deficient levels of Vitamin D and 37% have severely deficient levels. \nThe problem is far worse among African-Americans than Americans with lighter skin. Almost half of African-American women may be seriously Vitamin D deficient, with presumably still another fraction deficient. Furthermore, the authors say researchers at Harvard University and elsewhere believe the FDA minimum recommended daily allowance of Vitamin D is far too low. The Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) ranges from 200 to 600 International Units (IU). In fact, the authors themselves take Vitamin D supplements. The first author takes 1000 IU during wintertime and the second author takes 5,000 IU in wintertime. They do caution, however, that there is a level at which Vitamin D becomes toxic.\nSimilar research has also been recently performed by researchers at the Queensland University of Technology who found that many elderly were likely not getting sufficient Vitamin D due in part to insufficient exposure to the sun.

The band gained either further recognition when their song I'm Shipping Up to Boston, which based on lyrics written by Woody Guthrie, was featured in the soundtrack of the Academy Award-winning Best Picture \"The Departed\". Papelbon chose the song as his to play when taking the field and became a huge hit with the crowd after performing a Irish step dance to the song after winning the AL East title in the beginning of the month and performing it again after winning both the ALCS and the World Series. Papelbon was joined by fellow pitchers, Hideki Okijima and Mike Timlin.\nThis may not be the last rolling rally Boston will see this year, currently the Foxborough, Massachusetts based American football team New England Patriots are currently undefeated in the NFL and appear at this time to be headed to another Super Bowl and possibly to becoming the second NFL team in the league's history to go undefeated an entire season.

The location where dolphins are culled was moved to a secluded cove this year to hide the activity from television crews and protesters.\nAfter successfully defending the hunt, by using boat propellers and boat hooks against the group of surfers, who were joined by actress Hayden Panettiere, the fishermen have started their annual cull. \nWhaling in Taiji usually yields 2,000 dolphins per year using the dolphin drive hunting method. The dolphins are diverted from their migration route by banging metal rods. As fear can affect the taste of the meat, after being speared and bludgeoned to death, they are left to hang for a day before being cut up. Television crews and campaigners opposed to the culling were prevented by fishermen and local police from filming these activities.\nAlthough the practice of aquatic mammal hunting is condemned by many groups worldwide as well as within Japan, whaling is seen by those involved as a long-practiced cultural tradition that should be defended. As the demand for whale and dolphin meat for use in sushi has declined, the Government of Japan now has to financially subsidize the industry to support the local economy. Japan argues that whaling is still carried out for scientific reasons, to understand species population numbers. This claim is disputed by the scientific community outside of Japan as well as by environmentalists. "}

Washoe was the first chimpanzee to learn sign language, although whether or not Washoe's and many other great apes' communication is actually language is still a subject of controversy.\nIn the early 1960s, attempts to teach apes to speak had consistently failed. Allen Gardner and Beatrix Gardner hypothesized that this was due to physical constraints on the vocal apparati of the apes rather than a lack of brain power. To test their hypothesis, in 1966 they took the baby Washoe and began to teach her sign language which turned out to be successful; Washoe learned over 250 symbols from American sign language, and other researchers quickly began to make similar experiments with other chimpanzees and great apes.\nHowever, later work by Herbert Terrace suggested that the behaviour of Washoe and others was, to a large extent, imitating the researchers rather than spontaneous. Furthermore, Washoe and other chimpanzees never learned how to use grammar or how to construct recursions, two things which many linguists point to as unique aspects of language. Later attempts to have chimpanzees learn by observation as human infants do have also been successful, but there are still no signs that they have learned grammar. Some linguists such as Noam Chomsky have suggested that humans have specialized areas of the brain devoted to processing language and that we are hardwired to do so. Such hypotheses explain why apparently intelligent apes are unable to form language.\nThis is the second death this year of an animal famous for possibly learning language. In September 2007 Alex the Grey Parrot, who had learned to speak a variety of words and distinguish colors and shapes, died after a protracted illness.\nWhen Washoe and other apes who had learned ASL interacted with each other, they used ASL to communicate. \nWashoe spent the last few years of her life at Central Washington University at the Ellensburg campus.\nA memorial service is planned for Washoe for November 12, 2007. Details will be made available from \"Friends of Washoe,\" a non-profit organization."}

Children from the village of Khairat were given the opportunity to learn how to use the XO laptop. During the last year XO was distributed to children from Arahuay in Peru, Ban Samkha in Thailand, Cardal in Uruguay and Galadima in Nigeria. The OLPC team are, in their reports on the startup of the trials, delighted with how the laptop has improved access to information and ability to carry out educational activities. Thailand's \"The Nation\" has praised the project, describing the children as \"enthusiastic\" and keen to attend school with their laptops.\nRecent good news for the project sees Uruguay having ordered 100,000 of the machines which are to be given to children aged six to twelve. Should all go according to plan a further 300,000 machines will be purchased by 2009 to give one to every child in the country. As the first to order, Uruguay chose the OLPC XO laptop over its rival from Intel, the Classmate PC. In parallel with the delivery of the laptops network connectivity will be provided to schools involved in the project.\nThe remainder of this article is based on Carla G. Munroy's \"Khairat Chronicle\", which is available from the OLPC Wiki. Additional sources are listed at the end.\nIndia team.\nThe Mumbai team (OLPC-India)\nIn setting up the first pilot of the project in India, Carla and the OLPC team worked with Navi Mumbai telecommunications specialists - referred to as the Mumbai Team - who located the school for the XO laptop trial and established a relationship with the staff, students and community of Khairat school. Liaising with a local who sponsors schools in the area, Mr. Iyer, Carla's chronicle states, \"it turned out that they struck a gold mine in terms of kindness and pro-activity of the teacher, children, and community.\"\nAccording to the Khairat Chronicle report the Mumbai team was in two parts, but with little to separate them. A strategic team, working for OLPC-India in general and getting the project off the ground, started up in July, with the team's Mr. Joshi visiting the village with Carla's group on a number of times. He attended parent's meetings and acted as an advocate for the OLPC project, stressing villagers' involvement and explaining the role of Carla's team.\nAmit joined the team in September, bringing a technical background on the Linux operating system. He was introduced to the educational aspects of the project and assisted greatly with the technical aspects and community-building efforts.\nOn the whole, the Mumbai team were based in Navi Mumbai.\nThe OLPC team\nIn India from Late September, Carla was working on the educational side of the project, helping out as needed on technical issues and relations with the community. Carla was joined by Arjun and Manu early in October, working with Amit from the Mumbai team setting up the network infrastructure and testing it. Work on Marathi fonts was also carried out with Amit. After a little over two weeks during which the children were given their XO laptops and introduced to them the OLPC team left, providing long-distance support to the Mumbai Team and the Khairat community.\nKhairat.\nKhairat is a small village with around 200 people, placed near Mumbai in Maharashtra state. Carla described houses in the villages as \"spacious and minimalist in their furniture.\" A section of each of the 20 or so house is set aside for cattle, only an outside door is present on each house, and cooking is done with a wood-fired stove. In most cases a partial second roof or attic is where people will sleep.\nThe town school.\nChildren go to school 5 days in week, from Monday to Friday, from 10.30 AM to 5.30 PM and they attend also on Saturdays from 8.30 AM to 10.00 AM. The students are from 5 to 10 years old.\nKhairat school (Vastishala Khairat-Dhangarvada) is a one-room schoolhouse, it is years old. The land to build it was donated by a villager. Carla was told that she used to go and help the construction workers with the building of the school. She also came to help organize the digging of the hole for grounding the server. The building itself was sponsored by a villager who has a lot of land in the area. He also supports, on a continual basis, with other items the school needs.\nThe schoolhouse has three cabinets. The one with glass panes is where the children keep their textbooks, and it also contains reading books that children can grab to read. On the top shelf, there is a statue of Ganesha, to whom children bring some fresh flowers. In one corner is the water bucket, glasses, and dishes. On the other, is the raw rice bucket and the server cardboard box that sometimes is a desktop for the teacher and other times a table to drink milky, sugary Indian tea. This arrangement is recent though, because he volunteered his desk for setting up the server.\nA broad black strip is painted horizontally across all the walls, on which varied learning stuff is colorfully sketched with colored chalk, such as the Marathi and English alphabets, the water cycle, Mahatma Gandhi's face, the numbers in Marathi. Hanging from the ceiling, there's a fan and a few light-bulbs, which are rarely used because the sunlight that comes in through the door and the three grated windows is enough.\nThe workplace.\nThe first girl to arrive to school early in the morning sweeps the floor. The second girl to arrive helps her remove things from the corners. Other children help by taking out and placing at the entrance two small palm trees they keep inside when the school is closed. The older girls go to the village well for water to refill the water bucket and have water to drink during the day. They also count the rations of rice to be cooked for lunch and take it to the person who will cook it. Three rows are made with mats on the floor. The floor is the seat where the students sit, the surface on which they write, the boundless space they can use to adopt any position they find comfortable as well as to work in pairs or groups, and a classmate\u2014or the teacher\u2014can come and sit next to anyone to help.\nThe school is multilevel. Children from first to fourth standard take classes in the same classroom with the same teacher. Sometimes they all listen to the same explanation or work on the same assignment, but the teacher usually assigns different tasks to each level, and when the younger ones get stuck and he is busy working with other students, children from third and fourth standard help the first and second standard ones. They learn so much by always being in touch with the 'basics' and previously learned facts, knowledge, or skills, and by teaching others, they reinforce their knowledge. With the XO, they help each other by explaining or by pointing a finger at the screen or keyboard or by checking the work done. And it's not necessarily the older ones who help the younger, nor age or grade level what determines how they group together. You can also see children by themselves, focused on their work, oblivious to what is going on around them, even to what the teacher is saying or doing\u2014and in this case it is perfectly alright to not pay attention to the teacher.\nAlthough the teacher conducts the activities and is the leader and most knowledgeable one in the room, there reigns an atmosphere of independent work and independent grouping and consultations. The smaller ones are natural scouts and keep on exploring the laptops on their own, and when they find something interesting or need some help, they go to others to show them their findings or be helped out.\nMarathi.\nThe people in the village speak Marathi. The teacher speaks some English too. The children and the villagers talk to me in Marathi. Carla keep the communication channel open by smiling, which is easy and effective. Amit helps a lot by translating. \nTeacher session.\nThe plan was to just work with the teacher. However, as soon as he got his students back in school, the teacher started working with them and teaching them how to write their names in English and how to do several other things on the laptops.\nThe work with the teacher was on how to best use laptops as a tool to \u201clearn learning\u201d by expressing, constructing, designing, modeling, imagining, creating, critiquing, debugging, collaborating with the children, carrying out hands-on activities and project based work, retrieving specific data from the Internet, and publishing content and collaborative production of content on Wiki pages shared on the Internet.\nBecause one of the Third World's main problems is education, a \"Wikinews\" reporter has asked Carla about this question:\nP: Zana Brisks \"Born into Brothels\" film show that children have problem with their education, cause their mothers are prostitutes, but they take photos and they want to be photographers. Do you think that collaboration between OLPC, Kids with Cameras (children from Zana Briks documentary) and Wikimedia Foundation (I think about Wikimedia Commons) is possible?\nP: Media don't want write about 3rd World's problems (too often). How can we change this situation? Is it possible?\nParents' meetings.\nOct 3. Mr. Joshi came to Khairat school and organized a small impromptu parents' meeting. Few parents came because of such short notice. Basically, the idea was to explain the project to them and to invite them to take part in the learning of their children. The teacher explained the potential of the XOs in class and of all the relevant stuff that was now at their children's fingertips for them to learn or do, to which they had no opportunity before.\nEvery child at school.\nThe students' names in this article are pseudonyms."}

This foundation is matched as Doritos' brand symbol - Bold &amp; Creation, and \"Coolpedia\" made a impact with a great challenge in Taiwan's Internet culture.\nBrock: With visiting this website and referred some backgrounds provided by Ogilvy Public Relations Taiwan, I found an interesting idea on the pursuit of \"followed Wikipedia's example\".

I believe that Coolpedia and Wikipedia effected Internet culture in Taiwan deeply.\nBrock: What's about the internationalization with several Chinese People from many countries world-wide?\nClaire: Doritos is a notable world-class international brand by Pepsico. Many branches from Pepsico has their own ideas with their country culture, therefore, we won't promote the inter-language version of Taiwan's Coolpedia.\nBrock: I've ever participated lots of press conferences and seminars such as YouTube, Microsoft, and some companies from IT industry in Taiwan. Those above mentioned on some issues of media reusing, copyright, and practices in society in Taiwan. Especially in some cases, some companies was sensitive on the computing crimes, pirate and illegal copy issues because those above were discussed by some people from governmental and security industries in Taiwan. And also, some Internet users may spread their own files created by the others so that the common practice will turn from bad to worse. With those issues, what should Pepsico regulate participants from Coolpedia?\nClaire: We've regulated policies for participants. Of course, copyright violation will disadvantage Taiwan's Common Practice. If some participated works violated common practice, we'll decline those participations.

Aside from the physical risk, the violence that surrounds daily life in Baghdad creates an isolated atmosphere and a sense of futility. The idea of traveling outside the fortified zone is outlandish and only under heavy guard (the Blackwater guards accused by the Iraqi government of attacking Iraqi civilians were guarding diplomats). \nThe only association the diplomats have with civilian Iraqis is with those who work at the embassy. Even those Iraq nationals fear for their lives as they are targeted as \"collaborators.\""}

The mice have been dubbed \"mighty mice\" or \"supermice\" by the popular press and have been compared to cyclist Lance Armstrong.\nThe changes were created by adding an extra copy of a single gene, PEPCK-C. This gene is already present in the mouse genome, but the modified gene is designed to be strongly active \"(transcribed)\" in skeletal muscle. (The natural copy of the gene, most active in the liver, continues to function normally). The gene mediates a crucial rate controlling step of gluconeogenesis and glyceroneogenesis, and its activity helps to allow energy production by the mitochondrial citric acid cycle. In the transgenics, more energy is available to muscle through the burning of fatty acids, with much less production of lactate (a chemical that leads to sore muscles when one exercises). This is not as major a change to the mouse genome as it might seem to the layperson. The PEPCK-C gene is already present in the mouse and a variety of natural mutations could likely cause similar results. The study appears today in the \"Journal of Biological Chemistry\" in a paper with lead author Parvin Hakimi from the laboratory of Richard W. Hanson.\nThe altered mice can run at 20 meters per minute (0.75 miles per hour or 1.2 kilometers per hour) for up to six kilometers (nearly four miles) without stopping. The average treadmill time for strenuous exercise on a 25-degree incline is 31.9 minutes, well in excess of the 19 minute average of unmodified mice. Females can breed at two and a half years of age, whereas most female mice cannot breed after the first year. \nA colony of 500 mice has been bred, starting from six independent germline transformations (\"founder\" mice). The level of PEPCK-C in muscle is 9 units per gram of muscle as opposed to only 0.08 in normal mice. Levels of triglycerides and the number of mitochondria are also increased.\nHanson said that he did not expect that the results would be applicable to humans due to both practical and ethical considerations in addition to the fact that the genes might not function the same way in humans. \nThis is not the first time that the press has dubbed a genetically modified mouse a \"mighty mouse\". Earlier scientists at John Hopkins University announced that they had made mice with massively increased muscle mass that were larger and stronger than their normal cousins. These alterations increased strength rather than endurance through the genetic modification of myostatin and follistatin, or by injection of a soluble form of ACVR2B to block myostatin activity in normal mice."}

He had been on the run since 1983. His son Sandro Lo Piccolo and two other top mafiosi, Gaspare Pulizzi and Andrea Adamo, were arrested as well. All four men were among Italy's top 30 most wanted Mafia suspects, according to police officials.\nPolice fired several warning shots in the air as they moved in against the mafiosi, who were all armed but apparently did not put a fight. Sandro Lo Piccolo, in tears, shouted \"I love you dad!\" several times as he was being handcuffed. The four were put into a police helicopter and flown towards Palermo's main police station. At the police station there were scenes of jubilant disorder. As the convoy of police vehicles hurtled towards the entrance, officers wearing face masks gave \"V for victory\" signs to applause from a crowd outside.\nThe arrests came on the day that Palermo held a day of memory for all victims of the Mafia. Outside the Palermo police-station a crowd of dozens of curious onlookers began to gather as well as anti-Mafia activists.\nPax mafiosa.\nAfter the arrest of Corleonesi boss Provenzano, Salvatore Lo Piccolo and Matteo Messina Denaro were thought to be the new leaders of Cosa Nostra. Pizzini (small slips of paper used to communicate with other mafiosi to avoid phone conversations) found at Provenzano's hide-out indicated that Provenzano\u2019s joint deputies in Palermo were Salvatore Lo Piccolo and Antonio Rotolo. \nA 'pax mafiosa' initially settled in after Provenzano's arrest because neither Lo Piccolo nor Messina Denaro appeared to have sufficient forces to seek control of Cosa Nostra, according to the Italian news agency ANSA. Subsequent investigation revealed that Lo Piccolo and Messina Denaro had reached an accommodation and that the real threat to Lo Piccolo came from Rotolo who was arrested in June last year.\nAccording to Ansa, \"police were concerned by a couple of top-level hits they feared might spark a full-blown war of succession. Police said Lo Piccolo had the upper hand because he had been Provenzano's right-hand man in Palermo and his greater experience won him the respect of the older generation of bosses as they pursued Provenzano's policy of keeping as low as possible while strengthening their power network. These bosses had been reined in by Provenzano when he put an end to the Riina-driven war against the state that claimed the lives of Mafia crusaders Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino in 1992.\"\nStrengthened links with the American Mafia.\nLo Piccolo is believed to have strengthened the links between the Sicilian and American mafia. Sicilian families, who were forced to flee the island in the 1980s after losing the power struggle with the Corleonesi, were being brought back from the US to fill the void left by the arrests of Provenzano and many of his lieutenants.\nIn August, police arrested 14 people in an operation which uncovered close ties between local Cosa Nostra families and the US-based Mafia. According to investigators, the trans-Atlantic alliance uncovered in August involved drug trafficking and money laundering.\nLo Piccolo was reportedly betrayed by one of his closest lieutenants, Francesco Franzese, who was arrested in August. He started to collaborate with the authorities and members of Franzese's family were taken to an undisclosed location for their protection."}

The previous record from 1988 was broken today after 149 days without a new government.\nChristian Democrat Yves Leterme won the elections in Flanders together with his nationalistic coalition partner, and they promised more powers for the Dutch-speaking majority. Wallonian parties however remain reluctant to give in to unilateral demands and are asking for symbolic gestures and compromises in symbolic debates over the electoral district of Brussels and Halle-Vilvoorde.\nFlemish politicians argue that the time is high to split the district now, because a high court ruling from 2003 found the district unconstitutional. But their counterparts believe that everything works in two directions in Belgium, and unilateral demands have no place in a federal state.\nSome progress has been made in such areas as economical reforms, but the key debate of the elections lingers on. More than ever, the future of Belgium as a federal state is at stake, although immediate independence of the economically flourishing Flemish region is not currently being discussed by the negotiators.\nOn Wednesday, a commission of the Flemish parliament will vote on the topic of voting rights in Brussels, and it is expected that this will again stress Flanders' call for progress on autonomy for the region. Walloon Christian-Democrat Joelle Milquet, already dubbed \"Madame Non\" (Madame No) in Flanders because of her refusal to set aside her electoral promises to her constituency, warned during the weekend that such a move would be perceived as hostile, and that she would leave the negotiations table.\nCandidate Prime Minister Yves Leterme has called for unity last Friday: \"It's time for government negotiators to assume their responsibility in the national interest. It's time to stop mutual provocations.\" Many Walloons perceive Leterme as a defender of Flemish rather than Belgian values, as a notorious quote marking the Wallonians as intellectually incapable of learning Dutch, haunts him.\nBelgium is a federal state made up of some 6 million Dutch-speaking citizens in the north and some 4.5 million French-speaking inhabitants south of the language border. Brussels is bilangual, and there is a minuscule German-speaking community.\nWith no new coalition to follow them, the previous ruling parties continue to meet under former Prime Minister Guy Verhofstadt on a regular basis to make a few straightforward but necessary decisions, to avoid too many complications of the enduring political vacuum."}

The F-15 reached initial operational capability for the Air Force in September 1975.\nThe F-15C, D and E models were deployed to the Persian Gulf in 1991 in support of Operation Desert Storm where they proved their superior combat capability. F-15C fighters accounted for 34 of the 37 Air Force air-to-air victories. The F-15E's were operated mainly at night, hunting SCUD missile launchers and artillery sites using the LANTIRN system.\nThey have since been deployed for air expeditionary force deployments and Operations Southern Watch (the no-fly zone in Southern Iraq), Provide Comfort in Turkey, Allied Force in Bosnia, Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan and Iraqi Freedom in Iraq.\nThe Air Force is replacing its aging F-15 fighters with the F-22 Raptor. The F-22 is an advanced stealth fighter aircraft combining stealth for in both air-to-air and air-to-ground missions. However, budgetary concerns have caused the Air Force to reduce their total order of F-22s. "}

Two Democrats joined the nine Republicans to yield an 11-8 vote. Observers believe that Mukasey will easily succeed in the Senate vote.\nThe nomination of Mukasey by George W. Bush had originally drawn broad support. Nonetheless, Mukasey triggered a political row, during pre-confirmation questioning, when he refused to state that waterboarding amounted to illegal torture. In the end, he was able secure the votes of the two Democrats after assuring them that, if Congress passed legislation that made waterboarding illegal, he would in fact work to enforce such a law.\nPatrick Leahy, Senator from Vermont, who opposed Mukasey said: \"Some have sought to find comfort in Judge Mukasey\u2019s personal assurance that he would enforce a future, a new law against waterboarding if this Congress were to pass one. Unsaid, of course, is the fact that any such prohibition would have to be enacted over the veto of the president.\"\n\"Now, I wish I could support Judge Mukasey\u2019s nomination,\" Senator Leahy further said. \"I like Michael Mukasey. We have many things in common in our past careers. I certainly don\u2019t question his intellectual ability or his independence.\"\nThe two Democrats that voted for Mukasey were Senator Chuck Schumer of New York and Senator Dianne Feinstein of California. Schumer has been reported as suggesting Mukasey as Attorney General to White House during the search for a nominee.\nSchumer defended his vote, saying: \"If six months from now ... the same policies continued, the victory in defeating Mukasey would seem hollow. No one questions that Judge Mukasey would do much to remove the stench of politics from the Justice Department. I believe we should give him that chance.\"\nFeinstein said that her vote for Mukasey was because, otherwise, Bush could have an acting Attorney General, who would not need confirmation, until the end of his term. In explaing this, she said: \"I don't believe a leaderless department is in the best interests of the American people or of the department itself. [Bush] appointed this man because he believes he is mainstream.\"\nSenator Ted Kennedy of Massachusetts did not agree with Mukasey's view on waterboarding. \"Waterboarding is already illegal under United States law. It's illegal under the Geneva Conventions, which prohibit outrages upon personal dignity, including cruel, humiliating and degrading treatment,\" he said.\nWhite House Press Secretary Dana Perino said of the committee vote: \"Judge Mukasey has clearly demonstrated that he will be an exceptional attorney general at this critical time.\""}

At least 20 million toys are affected.\nSo far at least three children from the U.K. and at least two from Auckland, New Zealand have fallen seriously ill and are currently receiving medical attention. The toy is also sold in the United States as \"Aqua Dots\", with two reports received by the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) of children needing hospitalization after ingesting the beads.\n\"We've asked all our customers to take them off the shelf while we retest everything to make sure the toys comply with all regulations,\" said the company in a statement, although no mandatory recall has been issued for the product. The statement also says that the plant in Hong Kong was not using a chemical mixture approved by the company.\n\"This substitution was not at any time approved by Moose nor was Moose made aware of any substitution by the supplier,\" added the statement.\nThe toys were supposed to contain a non-toxic chemical known as 1,5-pentanediol, but instead 1,4-butanediol, which is mainly used in creating the illegal drug GHB, was used in the toys. When humans consume 1,4-butanediol, the body converts it into GHB and could make the individual seriously ill, causing headaches, seizures, dizziness and in some cases death. GHB is a natural chemical found in a variety of things such as beef, wine and some varieties of citrus fruits. It is also used as a pharmaceutical which is sold as Xyrem.\nRecent animal research indicates that drugs are available for human use which may work as antidotes to the poison, either by hindering its conversion to GHB with 4-methylpyrazole (fomepizole, Antizol) or by blocking GHB's effectiveness at the receptor (SCH 50911). Rodent testing has found the lethal dose of 1,4-butanediol to range from 1.4 to 2.5 grams per kilogram body weight, but an antidote can increase the lethal dose by a factor of 10.\nIt is not known how the chemicals got mixed up, but officials for the toy company say that they are continuing the investigation. The toy is currently banned in all of Australia, but the company says all those who bought it will be refunded their money.\n\"The issue of how a dangerous substance was used in these beads and not the non-toxic substance ... that is going to take us a few more days to uncover,\" said Australia's Fair Trade Minister, Linda Burney in a statement to the press.\nThe toy was recently named Australia's number one toy for 2007."}

At least 12 people were injured from glass and other injuries during evacuation, but are not in serious danger. Besides the eight that perished, only one other person has been reported to have received a gunshot wound, but is also reported to be out of serious danger. \nAt a news conference at 18:00 EET (UTC+2), police said that they arrested the shooter after a siege situation at the Jokela School Centre. The shooter is said to be an 18-year-old male student, named as Pekka-Eric Auvinen, who attended the school. \nThe police say that the shooter had probably shot himself at some point in an apparent suicide attempt. He died at nearby T\u00f6\u00f6l\u00f6 Hospital at 22:14 EET. The police confirmed that they had not used weapons during the incident.\nApparently, the killer had uploaded a home-made movie to YouTube announcing the \"massacre\" one day prior to the shooting. His profile featured several movies regarding an ongoing depression and unsuccessful treatment with SSRIs. Additionally, some movies of him shooting his new gun had been uploaded weeks prior to the shooting. Several hours after the event, YouTube decided to suspend his account due to terms of use violation. \nAuvinen also had a personal website which featured images, music and documents, including a manifesto. The site has since been removed by the service provider. In the manifesto, he called for a war on the \"weak-minded masses\" and said he was willing to die for his cause. \"I cannot say that I am of the same race as this miserable, arrogant and selfish human race. No! I have evolved a step higher,\" he wrote.\nPrayer vigils are being held at churches around Finland.

They are roughly equal in population according to their last censuses; which do you choose?\nDS: So is China.\nDS: It\u2019s more cohesive now, but China, once the Communist Party loses its grip on power, it\u2019s going to fall apart.\nDS: You have Muslim provinces, you have Tibet.

The cost of transferring the pensions of BBC Resources staff from the BBC pension scheme to its new owners could be up to \u00a350 million according to a Guardian Newspaper report.\nManagers from the division will meet with union representatives from BECTU on Monday to discuss this and related sale issues. BECTU general secretary, Gerry Morrissey is quoted as saying: \"If the BBC gets less than \u00a350 million for BBC Resources then how can it fulfil \"[sic]\" its duty of care to licence fee payers?\"\nIt is believed that the BBC had hoped that a surplus in its pension fund could be used to bridge the possible \u00a350 million gap \u2014 but the trustees of the fund have said \"no\". A BBC source said: \"This is being discussed at the highest level\".\nSince April 2004 members of the BBC pension scheme have seen their contributions into it increase regularly, the BBC \u2014 like many other employers \u2014 having reduced its contribution (to 4.5% of payroll) over a ten year period when the stock market was booming in the 1990s.\nThe Guardian is seen as a reliable source on BBC matters, having reported the proposed sale of BBC Television Centre back in January 2007, with the formal announcement finally being made by BBC Director General Mark Thompson on October 18, 2007.\nBackground to the Resources sale.\nThe Resources business-to-business unit was formed in 1998 and operates television studios, post-production and outside broadcast facilities for it's parent share-holding company, the BBC. It does not own any studios or premises, its assets being staff and equipment.\nAdvertised for sale on 16th August in the Financial Times, The Times and Broadcast and last year making profits of \u00a35.2 million with a revenue of \u00a3126 million, the disposal \u2014 led by Ernst &amp; Young \u2014 invited expressions of interest for the whole division or for each of its three operations separately. The BBC has yet to release the names of the short-listed companies. \nBBC Resources was the first of the BBC's commercial business-to-business divisions to be set up as a limited company and will be the last to be sold, the BBC having previously divested itself of BBC Technology and BBC Broadcast \u2014 BBC Worldwide, formerly BBC Enterprises, will remain in-house as it earns revenue from the archive, media and licensing of products \u2014 in the year to 31 March 2007 Worldwide had a turnover of \u00a3810.4 million, generating profits of \u00a3111 million.\nThe BBC wants to use any money raised to be put into international commercial expansion and content, most probably through Worldwide.\nIt had been intended to float Resources back in 2005, but this was postponed for two years following strike action and ACAS talks in June 2005 \u2014 the BBC giving an undertaking that there would be no preparations made to sell the company until January 2007, and no sale allowed before July of this year. The current time-scale would see its disposal by the end of the current financial year in March 2008."}

The scientists, including Prof. Klaus H. Theopold and graduate student Kevin A. Kreisel, believe the compound contains a quintuple bond, i.e., five bonds between the two chromium atoms.\nIn general, shorter bonds containing more electrons will be stronger. Although single, double and triple bonds occur in nature, quadruple and quintuple bonds have so far only been found in the laboratory. The first compound with a quintuple bond was reported in 2005. \nTo make the complex, the scientists first reacted chromium chloride with a bis(2,6-diisopropylphenyl)diazadiene ligand, which has the structure Ar-N=C-C=N-Ar (Ar is a bulky aryl group). This intermediate dark-green compound was then reduced using KC8 (potassium metal in graphite) to give the unusual product. The compound crystallises from ether as red/green plates. The quintuple bond between the metals is weakened by some mixing in from antibonding orbitals, reducing the overall bond order to around 4.28. The bond length is 0.026 \u00c5 shorter than the previous record, a dichromium complex reported in 1978 by F. Albert Cotton and coworkers, which featured a quadruple bond 1.828 \u00c5 long."}

The Boeing 737-400 aircraft overshot a runway at Yogyakarta, Indonesia on March 7.\nThe inquest indicated that Alison Sudradjat, Brice Steele and Mark Scott died from injuries sustained in the crash. Cahill commented that this finding would also apply to the deaths of two other Australians on the flight; the remaining fatal injuries were sustained by Indonesians. The inquest was opened at the request of families of the three victims involved in this inquest after the repatriation of their bodies.\nCahill agreed fully with a recent report issued by the Indonesian National Transportation Safety Committee, which indicated that the pilot-in-command attempted to land the aircraft at extreme speed despite 15 automated cockpit warnings and a request from the co-pilot to perform a go-around. He went on to suggest that the pilot should be prosecuted over his mistakes.\n\"I recommend that CASA and Air Services Australia and all Australian airlines review the report to consider whether any of the safety deficiencies identified have relevance to Australian aviation operations and therefore need to be addressed,\" he said.\nHe went on to describe concerns with how these deficiencies are being addressed in Indonesia: \"It is of some concern that the Indonesian regulator, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation, did not provide the National Transportation Safety Committee with details of safety action to address the recommendations which were in the draft report.\"\nAlison Sudrajat's daughter had this to say in light of the findings: \"It was very informative and it was nice to know what exactly happened, because he went into quite some detail about everything.\" \n\"It was quite comforting, but it's not going to bring anyone back.\""}

Nine people, including the gunman, were killed when Pekka-Eric Auvinen, 18, went on a shooting spree at his local school.\nUntil now, Finland has actively resisted plans for all European Union member states to limit gun ownership to persons aged 18 and over. Currently, the law stipulates that Finns may apply for a gun permit at age 15.\nHowever, Anne Holmlund, Finnish interior minister, told reporters today that \"Finland has changed its position to the EU firearms directive.\" Holmlund told the press that the intention is now to raise the age for ownership to 18, and require those aged 15-18 to be under parental supervision when carrying or using a firearm.\nPrime minister of Finland Matti Vanhanen had earlier commented that the shooting would likely cause a change in Finnish gun control policy, but Holmlund denied a direct connection. \"There is no direct link (to the school shooting). ... It is important that our new position is clear,\" Holmlund said.\n\"We were the only EU member country that was willing to keep its regulations untouched and it was obvious we would be left alone.\" She added.\n\"As all other EU countries are ready to accept the age limit of 18 years for the acquisition of firearms ... Finland does not want to oppose the said amendment to the directive under the circumstances.\"\n\"The cabinet is ready to agree on a proposal which says that those under 18 years old can use a gun only under parental or adult guidance,\" commented cabinet spokeswoman Sanna Kangasharju.\nMinistry spokesman Ilkka Salmi agreed that a potential change in legislation was being considered months beforehand, but added that, \"It's obvious that this kind of tragic incident has probably sped up the decision.\"\nAuvinen had obtained a license for his .22 caliber handgun via a local shooting club just weeks prior to the attack, on October 19. He opened fire on students and staff shortly before lunch break was due to start, killing five students and two staff members with the gun, which he called 'Catherine' in internet discussions, before turning it on himself. He later died in hospital. There is also evidence he attempted to set the building on fire.\nPolice have commented that he had apparently acted with intent to kill as many as possible, but selected his victims at random. The day prior to the incident, he posted a video on YouTube announcing his intentions. Police have also recovered a suicide note that said that he hated society.\nIn related news, police are investigating after an internet posting claimed Kirkkoharju middle school in Kirkkonummi was going to be the subject of another attack. Police say they are treating the incident as a \"bad joke\".\nFinnish gun ownership per capita is the third highest in the world, due largely to a long tradition of hunting sports in the country, but fatal attacks are exceedingly rare. Around 13% of the 5.2 million inhabitants own a gun, with only the United States and Yemen having higher levels of gun ownership."}

Suzanne Culpepper, the Roberts' former nanny, said Lindsay (Richard' second wife) and Richard spent money wildly. This included 275 pairs of shoes for Lindsay, 120 pairs of shoes (including 18 pairs of golf shoes) for Richard, 165 suits for Richard and other large amounts of clothing in their walk-in closest.\nPreviously the Roberts were accused of illegal political and financial wrongdoing, which forced the president to step down from his position.\nA United States Senate committee is currently investigating six major ministries over their finances. Three of these ministries are headed by members of ORU's Board of Regents.\nRecently Tulsa World wrote that Oral Roberts University raised $8.8 million starting in 2001 for a new student center, but construction has begun and officials said \"the school has used some of the money for scholarships and operations.\" Tulsa World requested documents about the ORU student center, but the \"university released details but not records about money raised for the center.\""}

With those changes in mind, \"Wikinews\" reporter interviewed You-peng Wang, chairman of the Taipei Electrical Commercial Association (TECA), the main organizer of TAVF, about the 60th year anniversary of TECA and the changes to the show.\nInterview.\nPart 1: Yuanshan Hall in The Grand Hotel.\nRico Shen: This show features exhibition at the twin halls, The Grand Hotel and Taipei World Trade Center, why did TECA decide to exhibit at these two halls?\nWang: In past years of TAVF, many participants promoted subwoofers, loudspeakers, and AV-media devices for sale, but some world-class Taiwanese companies may need good environment for the Hi-End experiences. As of this year, you can see some exhibitors imported a truck container house or rented a guest room for soundproof and high quality experiences and to serve senior AV-media consumers.\nRico Shen: Particularly the Hi-End quality is the best arrangement for TECA. Also, I sincerely congratulate TECA for the 60th year anniversary. By the way, what are the changes in Taiwan's AV-media industry?\nWang: In the past, some Taiwanese companies served as agencies and foundries for international manufacturers. They used original design manufacturers (ODM), manufacturing for other brands. Now, local brands and products (OEM) with good quality are increasingly marketed to the world, receiving praise by world-class professional media outside of Taiwan. We at TECA are proud of this success.\nRico Shen: In recent press conferences, some gaming and video companies cooperated with AV-media companies for high-definition and quality promotion. It caused some companies to become notable. What does TECA think about this trend and fashion? Does TECA support this way of promotion or cooperating?\nWang: We are extremely encouraged by our member companies who cooperate with different companies from the other industries like gaming, video, and information technology. I believe they've seen good factors at high-definition AV-media infrastructure in Taiwan.\nPart 2: TWTC Hall (Taipei World Trade Center).\nBefore returning to TWTC, Wang mentioned on the effectiveness of soundproofing, after a visit to a container house, some exhibitors thought soundproofing to be a key factor when experiencing loss-less Hi-End sound and said: \"We must provide the best experience and conditions to show the greatest performances of loudspeakers\". The interview below mentions the \"quality conception\".\nRico Shen: At the 60th year anniversary of the TECA this year, besides of the twin halls exhibition, what's the reason for the feature of the \"Global Audio &amp; Video History Corridor\" Pavilion at TWTC Hall?\nWang: If you're involved with the AV-media industry for the first time, you may not understand the evolution of its industry especially \"old antiques\". We made several old consumer AV-media players available to trace back on the history of the AV-media industry world-wide. And newbies (new consumers who just got involved with this industry) can learn the evolution of this industry by viewing the display of notable AV-media products from the past to the present.\nRico Shen: I just forgot to say something at Yuanshan, because TAITRA and Taipei Computer Association (TCA) ever held \"Exhibitors' Coordination of 2008 Computex Taipei\" last month, and I interviewed Enoch Du, the Secretary General of TCA. Both of those mentioned the recent issue of traffic problems. With the twin halls' exhibition, how the TECA solve the traffic issue during the show?\nWang: We [TECA] submitted the traffic solutions to the Department of Transportation of Taipei City Government and applied the shuttle bus service to Metropolitan Transport Corporation (MTC) for the visitors' convenience to go TWTC or Yuanshan and back. During the weekend hours, MTC will supply more shuttle buses to decrease the waiting period. For the MRT stations, we decided to improve the MRT shuttle bus service at MRT Yuanshan Station rather than Taipei City Hall Station because Capital Bus Co., Ltd has served the Taipei 101 shuttle bus for a long period.\nSummary.\nTaipei Audio Video Fair in this year is different than the past years. It is not just a \"local domestic show\" but conjoined education with enjoyment so that the 2007 TAVF takes advantage of the show's contents. The quality of a show is more valuable than the results to keep its good image with the media and the public."}

Many Asian countries dislike each other tremendously, and the conflict over Tibet is just one enduring multi-national battle.\nAccording to \"Vanity Fair\" contributing editor Craig Unger, it is not that Americans do not have these deep-seeded conflicts; it is that they do not remember them and thus have no context in which to see them as they resurface in our political culture. \nOn the same day he spoke to the Dalai Lama\u2019s representative, Shankbone sat down with Unger, author of \"The New York Times\" best-seller \"House of Bush, House of Saud\". In his new book, \"The Fall of the House of Bush\", Unger attempts to fill in some of the blanks of an epochal narrative in American politics. Using a mix of painstaking research, interviews with cultural and political leaders and delving into previously classified records to come up with some overview of how America has arrived at this particular political moment. \nTo make sense of such complicated history, Unger draws upon three themes: He illustrates the conflict within the modern Republican Party via the oedipal conflict between George W. Bush and his father, George H.W. Bush. Things are not well within the House of Bush. Bush Jr. has not only shut out his father and his allies from his administration\u2014something Bob Woodward discovered in his interviews with the President\u2014but he also appointed many of his father\u2019s bitterest enemies to key cabinet positions.\nUnger\u2019s second theme draws upon this Bush family feud: many of Bush Sr.\u2019s foes happen to be leaders of the neoconservative movement, who had been working against the President\u2019s father since the 1970\u2019s. Back then the neoconservatives did not have a base of political support within the Republican Party, which brings Unger to his third theme: the marriage between the neoconservatives and the Christian right to create a formidable ideological block.\nUnger is a Fellow at the Center for Law and Security at NYU\u2019s School of Law. In addition to his work at \"Vanity Fair\", he is a former editor-in-chief of \"Boston Magazine\", and former Deputy Editor of the \"New York Observer\". A journalist of the old school who believes in verifying his sources\u2019 veracity, Unger illuminates the Republican Party\u2019s ideological struggle between the old and the new and traces its history for those who do know it.\nUnger disputes the recent assertion by \"The New York Times\" that these forces are dead; they are thriving. Below is \u2019s interview with Craig Unger about his book, \"The Fall of the House of Bush\". \nOn the likelihood of an attack on Iran before the 2008 election.\nDavid Shankbone: Tim Wirth sent David Mixner this article by Jim Holt in the London Review of Books, and Mixner sent me a link to it. It posits that the Bush administration has all along planned on having a permanent military presence in Iraq. Have you seen it?\nDS: You\u2019ve written that Iran is definitely on the agenda for a military strike by the Americans.\nDS: If the neconservatives succeed, two years into the future where will we be?\nDS: Are there any Republican front-runners that would not undertake an assault on Iran?\nDS: So it could have been anybody but they ingratiated themselves with Bush?\nDS: And he wasn\u2019t particularly well-informed, giving them an \u201cin\u201d to educate him?\nDS: Within the United States, what are the neoconservatives and Christian right concerned will happen that could scuttle their agenda?\nDS: Would that still work after all this time?\nThis history behind the Bush family feud.\nDS: Is there a movement within the Republican Party that is working against the fundamentalism in the party?\nDS: Bob Woodward was astonished when Bush Jr. told him he had not spoken to Bush Sr. about the Iraq War at all. Do you come across what is behind that? \nDS: That was to educate Bush? The Daily Show did this piece where they did a debate splicing Texas Governor Bush\u2019s views of what he said when he was governor versus what he has said as President, and they are polar opposites. When he was governor he was saying we can\u2019t go out nation-building.\nDS: What was the problem with the intelligence apparatus at that time that the neocons needed to take control of it?\nDS: How did they bring Team B into the present?\nBush appoints his father's enemies to his Cabinet.\nDS: So Rumsfeld and Cheney are not seen as old Bush Sr. people.\nDS: Weren\u2019t they considered part of the realpolitik school?\nDS: What effect did it have on Bush Sr. that some of his bitterest foes were assuming positions in his son\u2019s administration?\nDS: I remember that mentioned.\nDS: Why was there a dispute between Rumsfeld and Bush Sr.?\nPaul Wolfowitz and the Office of Special Plans.\nDS: Coming back to current times, what continues to transpire in the formation of Bush Jr.\u2019s 2000 cabinet?\nDS: I believe Riza was called Wolfowitz\u2019s \u201cneoconcubine\u201d by his critics.\nDS: What does Mrs. Wolfowitz do about his extramarital affairs?\nDS: So they decide to redo the entire intelligence apparatus for Wolfowitz?\nDS: What was the CIA\u2019s reaction to this?\nDS: Was Powell aware of this?\nDS: Why?\nWhat the neoconservatives want.\nDS: What is the end goal with all of these machinations?\nDS: Saddam was so unpopular in the region; how did they foresee they would ruin the coalition if they rid Iraq of a very brutal dictator?\nDS: It still is.\nDS: Arafat didn\u2019t\u2014\nDS: So what is the end goal?\nDS: To control it?\nDS: Was that a surprise?\nThe Christian right and the neoconservatives.\nDS: In your book you talk about a confluence of social forces. You have the Christian right and you have the neoconservatives, who came together to assist each other in their agendas.\nDS: To the 1970s?\nDS: Did they openly talk to you about these things? \nDS: How did the neoconservatives and Christian right come together?\nDS: It would seemingly take a lot of collusion between them. How does it work?\nDS: Bush is convinced this is all God\u2019s will?\nOrthodox Jews and Fundamentalist Christians.\nDS: You have a chapter about the assassination of Yitzak Rabin; how did that advance the neoconservative agenda?\nDS: Are the Israeli orthodox Jews in touch with the Christian right in the United States?\nDS: What does the Christian right have to gain from this?\nDS: The End of Days?\nDS: This is so much material to be covered in just one book.\nDS: They have a model of the Supreme Court for arguing these fights.\nDS: Our society has always been complicated, but there are so many layers to this complex onion of a social movement that it must have been a challenge to articulate it in your book. We hold a lot of myths about our history. \nDS: Exactly, they recycle the same thematic stories over and over and that one has been written before.\nDS: But Scowcroft is loathed by George W.\u2019s administration for coming out against his foreign policy.\nDS: What does Bush Sr. think or say about Scowcroft\u2019s public statements?\nDS: Why would Bush Sr. not feel he has a moral obligation to the nation to make his feelings known to his son instead of keeping quiet and not speaking up?\n\"'DS: The neoconservative\u2019s policies are so high-risk and there are so many things that could make it go even more wrong. Grover Norquist came out and said that nothing the supporters of the war said would happen with Iraq has happened, and that everything the critics said would happen \"has\" happened. If Mubarak suddenly dies in Egypt and that country erupts into a civil war, which is a scenario that is often discussed as likely, that would implode the region even further. How do they account for all these risks they are laying in the lap of the United States?\nOn the press.\nDS: What sort of reaction do you get to your work?\nDS: You painstakingly researched this\u2014\nDS: Who have lost almost all credibility with the public...\nDS: We\u2019re stuck with them.\nDS: I interviewed Gay Talese, who had nothing but contempt for the Washington press corps. He feels they should be broken up and dispersed around the country to report on the federal government. Report on Washington from Denver, from Austin...national reporting from the states. \nDS: You get to go to a party; you get to ride in Air Force One\u2014\nDS: Just to be able to say, \u201cI interviewed Donald Rumsfeld.\u201d\nDS: Talese also said that the press is as much responsible for getting us into this war as are the people running it."}

Later, a wreath-laying ceremony took place to honor military veterans buried at Arlington National Cemetery just outside Washington.\nIn the Chicago area, the Edward Hines Jr. VA Hospital had a dedication ceremony, to commemorate a gift of 500 new wheelchairs from the Wheelchair Foundation and the Knights of Columbus. It provided an opportunity for soldiers of different generations to meet.\n\"It's an honor to shake hands with veterans who came before me,\" said Christian Tecson, to the \"Chicago Tribune\". Tecson, 27, who is in the National Guard, served two tours of duty in Iraq with the Marine Corps. \"They paved the way for us, and we're carrying on the tradition.\"\nIn Denver, like so many other cities, a parade was held on this day. However, the Denver United Veterans Council told a number of anti-war groups that they were not invited, regardless of whether they were also veterans groups. In the end, they were permitted to march in the parade, but got a mixed reaction from the crowd. \"Leave your politics at home! This is about veterans, not politics,\" shouted Alex Cuellar.\nPresidential candidate John McCain paid tribute to veterans at the New Hampshire Veterans Cemetery. McCain, in turn, received praise for his own service by the other speakers.\n\"The war and Iraq has divided America, but none of us is divided in our appreciation and our love and affection for those men and women in the military who are serving the cause of freedom,\" McCain said in his speech. \"Some of us here were in another war where America was divided in their support and that made our challenge of welcoming and bringing home all of veterans all the harder.\"\nIn Boston, Massachusetts' Govenor Deval Patrick honored the five surviving Tuskegee Airmen. Patrick called them \"heroic pioneers,\" as he presented them with the Congressional Gold Medal, which they were awarded in March. At the same event, Air Force Captain Jenny D\u2019Olympia, an Iraq War veteran, led a tribute to women veterans.\nPresident George W. Bush said in his weekly radio address: \"America owes a debt of gratitude to all those who have served in our Armed Forces. On Veterans Day, we remember those who have served in previous wars, those who are serving today, and those who did not live to become veterans.\"\nVeterans Day is largely intended to thank veterans for their service, to acknowledge that their contributions to United States national security are appreciated, and to underscore the fact that all those who served \u2014 not only those who died \u2014 have sacrificed and done their duty. It was first observed on November 11, 1919, a year after the Armistice with Germany, though then it was known as Armistice Day, which is observed in many other countries."}

It sounds like you were a hothouse flower.\nDS: They almost sound Soviet Communist.\nDS: What\u2019s your relationship with them now?\nDS: Why?\nDS: That\u2019s the reason you don\u2019t speak with them?\nDS: That must be a difficult thing to contend with, that a career would be the basis for a relationship.\nDS: Would you say in your previous work some of your conflict of dating would have been birthed from how your relationship with your family? How do you see the arc of your work?\nDS: Has the Iraq War affected you as an artist?\nDS: How has it affected you personally?\nDS: The struggle to be original in art is innate. When you are coming up with an idea for a song and then you all of a sudden stumble across it having been done somewhere else, how do you not allow that to squelch your creative impulse and drive to continue on.\nDS: When I interviewed Augusten Burroughs he told me that when he was in advertising he completely shut himself off from the yearly ad books that would come out of the best ads that year, because he wanted to be fresh and not poisoned by other ideas; whereas a band called The Raveonettes said they don\u2019t try to be original they just do what they like and are upfront about their influences.

As a result, he is likely to face criminal charges.\nMr Komar broke down outside his Jakarta residence as he told reporters \u201cI didn't plan for this to happen. The point is that I want people to know I am deeply in mourning and also that I understand what the families feel. I just did my job as normal, as usual, flying as a pilot.\u201d\nMr Komar is currently undergoing psychological treatment for mental problems caused by the crash.

I have explained everything to the KNKT (Indonesian National Transportation Safety Committee) and to the police,\" he said.\nMr Komar said he couldn't comment on technical aspects of the crash, or of the criticisms of his conduct, as the matter is still under police investigation. He is likely to face negligence charges which carry a prison sentence if convicted.\nThree other Garuda employees are currently being questioned in Jakarta by police as part of the investigation. They've been told that they are being interrogated as \"witnesses\".\nMeanwhile, Emirsyah Satar, managing director of the airline, has announced an intention to resume flights to Europe next year, assuming success in a current bid to get the airline off the list of air carriers banned in the EU, where all Indonesian airlines were placed earlier this year.

The United States Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice also denied that an attack was imminent, stating that there is no Congressional authorization for military action against Iran.\nThe denials came as \"The Observer\" ran a report saying that US personnel involved in interrogating insurgents in Iraq are under \"huge\" pressure to find evidence against Iran. It quoted Micah Brose, a privately contracted interrogator working for the US military there, as saying that information on Iran is \"gold\".\n\"They push a lot for us to establish a link with Iran\", Brose claimed in the interview, adding that \"it feels a lot like, if you get something and Iran's not involved, it's a let down.\" He further claimed that people have said to him that \"they're really pushing the Iran thing.\" Brose denied being asked to manufacture evidence, but stated that \"if a detainee wants to tell me what I want to hear so he can get out of jail ... you know what I'm saying.\"\nThe US has in the past been accused of using exaggerated and fabricated evidence to build its case against Iraq prior to the war.\nThe article by the British based newspaper said most military intelligence officers refused to comment but that one said \"The message is, 'Got to find a link with Iran, got to find a link with Iran.' It's sickening.\"\nOn Monday, Admiral William J. Fallon, the commanding officer of United States Central Command which is responsible for the Middle East, East Africa and Central Asia, speaking in \"Financial Times\", said that a strike against Iran is \"not in the offing.\"\n\"None of this is helped by the continuing stories that just keep going around and around and around that any day now there will be another war which is just not where we want to go,\" Fallon continued. \"Getting Iranian behavior to change and finding ways to get them to come to their senses and do that is the real objective. Attacking them as a means to get to that spot strikes me as being not the first choice in my book.\" Despite saying this, he refused to rule out a strike against Iran in the future.\nMeanwhile, US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice was on ABC's \"This Week\" on Sunday, saying that a Senate resolution designating Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard as a terrorist organization does not authorize military action.\n\"There is nothing in this particular resolution that would suggest that from our point of view. And, clearly, the president has also made very clear that he's on a diplomatic path where Iran comes into focus,\" Rice said.\n\"This resolution is saying that there needs to be strong measures taken against Iran, which we have definitely done,\" Rice continued. \"And if the Iranians suspend their enrichment and reprocessing, I'm prepared to meet my counterpart anyplace, anytime, anywhere. So the question isn't why will we not talk to Tehran. The question is, why will Tehran not talk to us?\"\nSenator Hillary Clinton, who is running for President, voted for the resolution. She has said that the resolution could not be used to justify war, but rather it seeks to escalate diplomatic efforts. \"We wish to emphasize that no congressional authority exists for unilateral military action against Iran,\" she said in an open letter on November 1, 2007.\nLast week, former Foreign Minister of Germany, Joschka Fischer said that he was worried that the upcoming US Presidential election could heighten tensions between the US and Iran. He found particularly worrisome a statement by Presidential candidate Rudy Giuliani in October that \"If I am President of the United States, I guarantee you, we will never find out what they will do if they get nuclear weapons, because they are not going to get a nuclear weapon ... the military option is not off the table.\""}

Tar-like sands laden with oil and seaweed were piled on the shore, while oil-covered birds in slick-covered water tried to flap their wings. Regional coast guard officer Anatoly Yanhuck said once weather improves they will begin pumping oil from the tanker, then tow the ship to port.\nTwo fuel-loaded barges and Turkish freighter \"Ziya Kos\" also ran aground in the area, but there was no further environmental damage, said Petrov. Ten ships altogether were sunk or run aground in the area of the Black Sea near the Straight of Kerch and the Straight itself; a Russian freighter carrying metal was also reported as having sunk near the port of on Ukraine's . \nOne of the sulfur-carrying freighters reported three crew members as drowned, and five more as missing, while two members of the sunk freighter carrying metal were reported as drowned and another remains missing. The oil tanker's 13 crew members were all rescued safely, and all members of the second freighter were also reported as safe. \nCaptains had been warned Saturday morning of the stormy conditions, regional prosecutor Maxim Stepanenko told Russia's Vesti 24. The oil tanker was not built to withstand fierce storms, having been designed to transport oil on rivers during times, he said. \nChemist with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's of response and restoration, Jim Farr said the spill from the two freighters wouldn't create a \"hazardous situation\", a statement backed up by Alexei Zhukovin, expert with the Emergency Situations Ministry's branch in Southern Russia. Although on land sulfur is used as a fungicide, in a marine setting it wouldn't act as one, said Farr; instead a sulfur spill can be compared to dumping sand on a reef and smothering it, or placing a blanket on a bed of grass. Long-term effects are more difficult to speculate on, however, without better knowledge of the area and its currents. Oleg Mitvol said that although the sulfur spill doesn't present an environmental danger, the two freighters might also leak fuel oil from their tanks, adding to the pollution.\nRussia, Turkey, Bulgaria, Romania, Georgia, and Ukraine all border on the Black Sea."}

The farm is owned by Gressingham Foods.\nOfficials also say that it is likely that the virus arrived in the U.K. by way of migrating birds and that the virus resembles the H5N1 strain that was discovered in August in Germany. Other possibilities of infection are currently being investigated by officials such as infected turkey food or being brought overseas by humans.\n\"Everybody needs to be concerned, this is avian influenza. We are asking every poultry keeper to be vigilant, to house their birds where they are required to do so in any restricted area and carry out good bio-security measures and report any signs of disease. This is a particularly challenging site and our priority is to adhere to strict bio-security, and the health and safety of staff on site is paramount,\" said Fred Landeg, a chief officer of veterinary medicine.\nHealth officials say that all of the birds on the farm, at least 5,000 ducks geese and turkeys, will be killed, most of which already have been. They have also designated a radius of three (1.9 miles) kilometers from the farm, a \"protection zone\" and are monitoring the situation from at least a 10 k.m. (6 mile) radius of the farm to attempt to prevent the spread of the disease. It is not known if the virus has spread beyond the farm. All cars entering and exiting the area are reportedly being sprayed with a disinfectant. Birds on farms nearby are being kept indoors and away from any other wild birds.\n\"We will be looking at the movements on to the premises and off the premises of birds and movements of people, vehicles and things, to see whether there is another origin somewhere in the country or whether the disease could have spread,\" added Landeg.\nOfficials also say that the commission for the European Union have been notified.\nIn April of 2006, the deadly H5N1 virus was found in the remains of a wild Mute Swan in the village of Cellardyke in Fife, Scotland. In February, poultry producer Bernard Matthews' farm in Suffolk had more than 160,000 birds killed after they were infected with the H5N1 virus.\nOther deadly diseases have recently took a hold on the U.K. and farmers. An outbreak of bluetongue disease was reported last September, while foot-and-mouth disease reemerged in August after a breach in biosecurity at a U.K. research laboratory."}

He did not clear customs at the airport for over eight hours and his mother was unable to locate him when she went to meet him at the airport. Since Dziekanski did not speak English airport security guards were unable to properly communicate with him. He started yelling at the airport staff because of this. He used chairs to prop open a door between a customs clearing area and a public lounge, he then threw a computer and threw a small table at a luggage section window.\nHe had calmed down and was standing with his hands at his side in the customs room until four Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) officers arrived and tasered the man, at least twice. Dziekanski began to convulse and was tasered a second time after falling to the ground, where the four officers pinned him down and handcuffed him. He screamed before he stopped moving. Paramedics arrived at the scene, but were unable to revive him and pronounced him dead.\nDziekanski's mother had told him to wait in the luggage area where she would meet him, not realizing that this was inside the airport's security zone, which was inaccessible to her. Arriving international passengers need to pass through customs first, before being able to meet people waiting to pick them up. His mother had tried in vain to get a message to him and eventually left the airport when told by airport staff that he wasn't there.\nPaul Pritchard, who had just arrived from China back to Victoria, shot a video of the incident and gave it to police. The police promised they would return the video within 48 hours. They gave him back his camera without the video.\nPritchard immediately hired a lawyer, held his own news conference, and threatened that he would take them to court to get it back.\nCBC, CTV and Global television paid Pritchard several thousand dollars for the video, and he says he will use the money to take care of his father.\n\"It was against his [Pritchard's father] wishes completely and my lawyer's wishes as well. Profit is such an ugly word, and I hope people realize that it's not a personal profit,\" said Pritchard.\n\"I extend my heartfelt condolences to Mr. Dziekanski's family, knowing that I could not hope to speak to the loss that they have suffered.

He was not making a gesture that he intended to fight anybody\" and \"he didn't know what to do. In fact, he was in search (of) help.

The deal will be delivered to the European Commission ahead of a November 19 meeting in Brussels to review the placement of all 51 of Indonesia's airlines on the list of air carriers banned in the EU in June after a string of aviation accidents earlier in the year. Indonesia is already planning to give a presentation on air safety improvements at the meeting.\nUnder the deal, the airlines have promised to increase supervision of security and safety issues, while the government pledged to increase numbers and abilities of regulation staff. The deal comes a week after EU inspectors suggested that the airlines would benefit from increased safety standards and larger numbers of more highly trained management staff. Ultimately, the deal is intended to bring Indonesia fully up to the standards set down by the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO).\nThis is a part of a serious effort by the operators and regulators to improve our aviation safety and meet international standards,\" Transport Minister Djusman Syafii Djamal told \"Radio Elshinta\" of Jakarta after the ceremonial signing of the document, adding hopes that the deal would cause the removal of the EU ban.\nThe deal was arranged by the National Team for Transportation Safety and Security, which was set up to investigate Indonesia's failing transportation infrastructure, particularly the aviation sector. \nThe six-man group was chaired by Marshal Chappy Hakim, a retired Air Force chief of staff. He told reporters that he felt \"We need to work hard to prove we can meet international standards, and that starts with this declaration,\" \nThe ban was orriginally placed after three accidents involving Indonesian airliners - the New Year's Day crash of Adam Air Flight 574, which killed 102 people, the subsequent accident involving Adam Air Flight 172, which cracked in half on a hard landing but held together, preventing serious injury, and the March crash of state-run Garuda Indonesia Flight 200, which claimed 23 lives.

Indonesia has since been taking steps recently to improve it's air safety, having already started ranking airlines on safety and signing a deal with the ICAO to set up an independent regulatory body and improve Air Traffic Control operations. Earlier this year, Indonesia shut down several airlines that it viewed as not meeting safety standards. A team from the European Aviation Security Agency has inspected Indonesian airports and interviewed the managers of Garuda Indonesia, Mandala Airlines and Air Fast to gauge how far safety has improved.\nThe ICAO will evaluate Indonesia's progress in late 2008."}

He died later in hospital, having never regained consciousness.\nAll last week repair teams have been working to eradicate all traces of the event, with large numbers of bullet holes in walls and doors being filled in, broken windows and torn blinds being replaced, and total renovation of one corridor which Auvinen had attempted to set fire to.\nStudents had previously been permitted into the school last week, in order to collect belongings left behind as they rushed to evacuate the school.

People have questioned the decision of a survey last month to designate Finland as the world's \"most livable country\". Psycho-social service manager Anna Cantell-Forsbom from nearby Vantaa has spoken out about her view that the shooting was mainly caused by a lack of psychiatric care available to the Finnish youth and therefore did not reflect on Finnish society.

A Midwest Airlines plane carrying 24 people and a United Express aircraft carrying 31 people came within 600 vertical feet and 1.3 horizontal miles apart.\nThe eastbound Midwest Airlines jet was accidentally directed to descend into the direct path of the westbound United Express flight. The mistake was made after an air traffic controller erroneously removed the latter aircraft's identification aircraft tag in preparation to handing off the aircraft to the air traffic control centre for a neighbouring sector of airspace.\nThe Traffic Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) installed in the cockpits of both aircraft sounded emergency warnings advising the pilots to take evasive action. The Midwest Airlines plane promptly pulled up out of danger. Had TCAS not activated, it is believed the jets would have struck each other. \"If they didn't suddenly climb, there would have been a convergence,\" said Midwest spokeswoman Carol Skornicka.\nHad the aircraft struck each other, they would have been traveling at a combined speed of about 700 m.p.h. Airspeed would normally be higher, but congestion around O'Hare International Airport had slowed things down. The incident occurred at the end of a rush period, during a change in shift at the control centre.\nJeffrey Richards, president of the National Air Traffic Controllers Association, told reporters that pilots had mentioned three times in the course of the flight how close aircraft were coming, quoting them as saying to air traffic control on one occasion \"Center, you really lined us up on that last clearance.\"\nNear air misses are classified on a scale of D to A by the Federal Aviation Authority, A being the most serious. The incident was classed as a B, the third incident of such severity in just six weeks caused by mistakes at Chicago Centre. The minimum permitted distance for aircraft traveling at an altitude of 25,000 feet, as these two were, is five horizontal miles and 1,000 vertical feet.\nRichards said that on the night of the incident controllers at Chicago Centre had been working close to the two hour working limit between rest breaks. \"These controllers are fatigued from working such long stints and very few breaks compared to just three years ago,\" said Richards, who added that this was particularly true of the 26-year-old veteran who made the mistake. \"Each of his sessions were right up to the two-hour limit,\" Richards said, adding that he was nearing the end of his shift and had returned from a break just minutes before the near-collision.\nRichards said that at the time the building contained a staff of 11 controllers, five trainees and one supervisor, which is one supervisor and one controller lower than usual. He went on to say that before a retirement wave, 17 controllers monitored the airspace. He says this is a part of a larger issue whereby retirements are exhausting the supply of skilled operators, in what he describes as \"a systemic problem,\".\nThis latest incident raises important safety issues at Chicago Centre, which is currently undergoing a dispute between the controllers union and management over how many controllers are adequate to run the centre. The site is soon to have to handle large quantities of traffic as an annual holiday season starts. However, the FAA says that it currently has no issues with staffing at the facility, although Richards contends that low levels of staff and increasing workloads have long been a worrying factor at the facility.\nSkornicka said of the incident that it was \"part of a bigger debate taking place,\" and that she felt \"this is just one situation that highlights the need for modernization and overhaul of the air traffic control system.\""}

In this segment he talks to downtown legend Murray Hill, former New York City mayoral candidate and comedian, on the last night of Mo Pitkins' House of Satisfaction.\nMurray Hill the performer.\nDavid Shankbone: Where is Murray Hill from?\nDS: What does Murray Hill do on a Saturday?\nDS: Do you ever talk about the Iraq War in your routines?\nDS: Has the war affected you at all?\nDS: Would you ever leave New York?\nDS: Why?\nDS: Do you feel like you are being held back here because it has dwindled so much?\nDS: How has your show evolved since you started doing it?\nDS: When you say you have honed your craft, what sort of research do you do?\nDS: They say all really great comedians they honed their craft through personal tragedy.\nDS: Does that apply to you?\nMurray Hill the person.\nDS: Who have you patterned your persona of Murray Hill after?\nDS: As Murray Hill?\nDS: Does your family accept you?\nDS: How was the reaction?\nDS: What do you do when you\u2019re not doing show business?\nDS: Are you dating anyone?\nDS: \"The New York Times\" article made it seem like you are embodying this character, that you have become him, and have no personality outside of Murray Hill.\nDS: Do you consider yourself transgendered?\nDS: Do you consider yourself butch?\nDS: Because it denies your femininity as well?\nDS: Do you surprise yourself with your sexuality?\nDrag as performance art for women.\nDS: You don\u2019t like the phrase drag king, is that correct?\nDS: What is a drag king?\nDS: What do you think people think of when they hear \u2018drag king\u2019?\nDS: Who is rarely divorced from that personality\u2014\nDS: Then there\u2019s Lypsinka, who very much sees it as a character.\nDS: Do you think it\u2019s less acceptable to be a drag king or a drag queen?\nThe gay community and drag artists.\nDS: Do you think you get it worse from the gays or worse from the mainstream?\nDS: I interviewed Michael Musto and he spoke about how younger gays are embracing their femininity more and have overcome body fascism; but in my interview with RuPaul she said almost the exact opposite. She felt men using femininity as part of their emotional palate is still considered anathema. What do you think about how gender is seen today among younger people?\nDS: You think RuPaul\u2019s perspective is coming from a show-tour world?\nDrag queens and drag kings: the differences.\nDS: With drag queens it seems like almost anything is on the table. If they want to butch it up, if they want to fem it up. In the craft, are there boundaries you feel you can\u2019t cross? \nDS: What about in terms of gender roles, how you use gender? Are there boundaries for a drag king when they are performing in terms of what they should or shouldn\u2019t do?\nThe direction of New York downtown culture.\nDS: Why do you think the drag king scene in New York has died down?\nDS: But it used to be?\nDS: The Pyramid Club days\u2014\nDS: Where do you think downtown Manhattan culture is going right now?\nDS: Where in Brooklyn?\nDS: Do you think it\u2019s a permanent change?\nDS: When was that?\nDS: Where did it go?\nDS: Is there not an audience for it anymore?\nDS: Why wouldn\u2019t they cultivate a scene? Everybody is still here.\nDS: Manhattan was always so central, do you think Brooklyn can fulfill that role or is the central-ness gone?\nDS: What kinds of places are cultivating the scene there and by whom?"}

The ringtone features a voice actor (avoiding legal issues) with beats and a loop effect emphasising the 'shut up'. A student group from the Venezuelan capital of Caracas which opposes the President has downloaded the ringtone too. \"It's a form of protest, it's something that a lot of people would like to tell the president. Now, whenever we call each other, that's what we hear,\" said Laura Solorzano, 21, in a telephone interview with the Miami Herald.\nToday, the internet domain name of the quote was sold on eBay for \u20ac10,200 to a Spanish power seller called 'daikoku-design'.

The video on YouTube has been viewed over 1.3 million times, and there are numerous parodies using the quote. T-shirts and coffee mugs with the slogan are also selling well. The phrase has also become notable enough to merit an article on Wikipedia.\nAt the Ibero-American summit in Santiago, Chile on November 10, Ch\u00e1vez called the Spain's former prime minister, Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Aznar, a \"fascist\". Current Prime Minister of Spain Jos\u00e9 Luis Rodr\u00edguez Zapatero tried to reply, but Ch\u00e1vez, although his microphone was switched off, kept interrupting him. The Spanish King first pointed a finger at Mr. Ch\u00e1vez, with the words \"Y tu\" (and you). Then, while Zapatero still tried to reply, he said \u201c\"\u00bfPor qu\u00e9 no te callas?\"\u201d while making a gesture with his hand. Note that the King used the informal 'te callas' instead of the formal and polite third-person form. Zapatero finally replied that \"...in a forum where there are democratic governments ... one of the essential principles is respect. You can disagree radically, without being disrespectful.\" '\nThe rare outburst of the King has led to some disturbance in political relations between the countries; Ch\u00e1vez demanded an apology from the King but said he did not want a political conflict with Spain, while Spanish diplomats hope the situation will soon normalise. The Spanish PM stressed the incident was magnified by of the media attention it received. In statements to the press, the president of Brazil, Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, minimized the incident between Hugo Ch\u00e1vez and the King of Spain: \"There is little difference in opinion between King Juan Carlos and Chavez.

Since its inception, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) has made headlines and raised eyebrows. They are almost single-handedly responsible for the movement against animal testing and their efforts have raised the suffering animals experience in a broad spectrum of consumer goods production and food processing into a \"cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre\". \nPETA first made headlines in the Silver Spring monkeys case, when Alex Pacheco, then a student at George Washington University, volunteered at a lab run by Edward Taub, who was testing neuroplasticity on live monkeys. Taub had cut sensory ganglia that supplied nerves to the monkeys' fingers, hands, arms, legs; with some of the monkeys, he had severed the entire spinal column. He then tried to force the monkeys to use their limbs by exposing them to persistent electric shock, prolonged physical restraint of an intact arm or leg, and by withholding food. With footage obtained by Pacheco, Taub was convicted of six counts of animal cruelty\u2014largely as a result of the monkeys' reported living conditions\u2014making them \"the most famous lab animals in history,\" according to psychiatrist Norman Doidge. Taub's conviction was later overturned on appeal and the monkeys were eventually euthanized.\nPETA was born.\nIn the subsequent decades they ran the Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty against Europe's largest animal-testing facility (footage showed staff punching beagle puppies in the face, shouting at them, and simulating sex \nacts while taking blood samples); against Covance, the United State's largest importer of primates for laboratory research (evidence was found that they were dissecting monkeys at its Vienna, Virginia laboratory while the animals were still alive); against General Motors for using live animals in crash tests; against L'Oreal for testing cosmetics on animals; against the use of fur for fashion and fur farms; against Smithfield Foods for torturing Butterball turkeys; and against fast food chains, most recently against KFC through the launch of their website kentuckyfriedcruelty.com.\nThey have launched campaigns and engaged in stunts that are designed for media attention. In 1996, PETA activists famously threw a dead raccoon onto the table of Anna Wintour, the fur supporting editor-in-chief of \"Vogue\", while she was dining at the Four Seasons in New York, and left bloody paw prints and the words \"Fur Hag\" on the steps of her home. They ran a campaign entitled Holocaust on your Plate that consisted of eight 60-square-foot panels, each juxtaposing images of the Holocaust with images of factory farming. Photographs of concentration camp inmates in wooden bunks were shown next to photographs of caged chickens, and piled bodies of Holocaust victims next to a pile of pig carcasses. In 2003 in Jerusalem, after a donkey was loaded with explosives and blown up in a terrorist attack, Newkirk sent a letter to then-PLO leader Yasser Arafat to keep animals out of the conflict. As the film shows, they also took over Jean-Paul Gaultier's Paris boutique and smeared blood on the windows to protest his use of fur in his clothing.\nThe group's tactics have been criticized. Co-founder Pacheco, who is no longer with PETA, called them \"stupid human tricks.\" Some feminists criticize their campaigns featuring the Lettuce Ladies and \"I'd Rather Go Naked Than Wear Fur\" ads as objectifying women. Of their Holocaust on a Plate campaign, Anti-Defamation League Chairman Abraham Foxman said \"The effort by PETA to compare the deliberate systematic murder of millions of Jews to the issue of animal rights is abhorrent.\" (Newkirk later issued an apology for any hurt it caused). Perhaps most controversial amongst politicians, the public and even other animal rights organizations is PETA's refusal to condemn the actions of the Animal Liberation Front, which in January 2005 was named as a terrorist threat by the United States Department of Homeland Security. \n attended the pre-release screening of \"I Am An Animal\" at HBO's offices in New York City on November 12, and the following day he sat down with Ingrid Newkirk to discuss her perspectives on PETA, animal rights, her responses to criticism lodged against her and to discuss her on-going life's work to raise human awareness of animal suffering. Below is her interview. \nThe HBO film about her life.\nDavid Shankbone: How did you feel about the film?\nDS: You are pretty media savvy; was that okay with you that they crafted the film the way they did?\nDS: Many people when they hear about PETA think they are an organization that is more concerned with the well-being of chickens than they are with the well-being of humans. How would you respond to that?\nDS: Jim Young, one of the lab people with the really red ears\u2014\nDS: Everyone was looking at them. One of the things he had said was that you want to completely disassociate animals with humans.\nDS: Douglas Adams\u2019 Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy?\nPETA, animal rights groups and the Animal Liberation Front.\nDS: How do you feel when you hear other animal rights organizations coming out against PETA?\nDS: What is something you have been asked to condemn?\nDS: By the Animal Liberation Front?\nDS: So you are okay with ALF activities? Some of that was covered in the film.\nDS: L\u2019Oreal, Maybelline\u2014\nDS: How do you feel about the ALF?\nDS: Is arson a lesser of two evils proposition for you, then?\nNewkirk on humans and other animals.\nDS: A critic would say that there is no equating humans with animals. That by stopping research that saves lives based upon these animals you are valuing chickens or mice over people.\nDS: Like the saccharine experiments, which were ridiculous because they showed it causes cancer in mice when you inject them with eight times their body weight daily with saccharine. We aren\u2019t mice, and who consumes such amounts?\nDS: Do you think blocking stem cell research is something that harms animals?\nDS: In your book \"Making Kind Choices\" you have a chapter on bees. Have you been following the recent development on the \u2018Rapture of the Bees?\u2019\nDS: What do you think is happening with the bees?\nDS: That\u2019s the thing: they can\u2019t find any bee bodies. Millions and millions have disappeared.\nDS: In your book she calls them \u2018honeystealers\u2019\nReligion and animals.\nDS: The Bible talks about humans as custodians of the Earth, and the religious community is beginning to awaken to the notion that this means they need to be involved on environmental issues. What is the religious community\u2019s relationship to animal welfare?\nDS: Sam Brownback raised that exact same quote in my interview with him, that God cares even when the smallest sparrow falls\u2014\nDS: In the movie they show PETA making a change in tactics from focusing on exotic animals to focusing on livestock such as turkeys. Exotic animals are things most people could support, but livestock is more out there for many. How would you respond to the argument that progress is incremental and by taking a leap from focusing on exotics to focusing on livestock you could be overreaching? \nDS: A religious argument might be that they were put on Earth \"for\" Man.\nFashion and animals.\nDS: Did your protest at Jean-Paul Gaultier have any effect?\nDS: You had mentioned earlier wool clothing in relation to Australian exporters. Are you against wool clothing or against how it is made and harvested?\nNewkirk on the worst corporate animal abusers.\nDS: When you think of companies\u2014obviously Butterball would be one\u2014\nDS: Who are some of the most egregious abusers of animals?\nDS: \u201cOh God, here comes Ingrid Newkirk with her soy chickens again!\u201d\nDS: What is Controlled Atmosphere Killing?\nAnimal Enterprise Terrorism Act.\nDS: Tell me how the Animal Enterprise Terrorism Act impedes you, and what you are doing to defeat the Act.\nDS: Would you do a target investigation in a state where they have that act passed just to test its Constitutionality?\nIngrid Newkirk on Ingrid Newkirk.\nDS: Did you and Alex Pacheco have a falling out?\nDS: Like a family\u2014\nDS: Are you still in contact with him?\nDS: Is he looking at becoming involved again?\nDS: How would Ingrid Newkirk twenty years ago look at Ingrid Newkirk now?\nDS: Just twenty years ago, the person you were then looking at the person you are now.\nDS: Do you think you\u2019ve achieved a lot of the things you had wanted back then?\nDS: Do you think other people would say that?\nDS: Do you have any regrets?\nDS: Or personally.\nDS: Just in general\u2014in your life.\nDS: See. Sometimes terrible questions birth wonderful answers.\nDS: The nature of this interview is on a permanent encyclopedia\u2014\nDS: --so the questions are designed not just around your work, but also around who you are as a person.\nDS: I didn\u2019t see you as sad in that movie.\nDS: It\u2019s interesting you brought that up, because a thought I had watching the film is that people always find something to criticize with a person. It\u2019s not, \u201cOkay, Ingrid just really loves animals and wants to help them\u201d but \u201cyou\u2019re obsessed and sad.\u201d If you were taking a $1,000,000 salary every year and driving around in a Mercedes, they would say, \u201cShe\u2019s not really in it for the animals, she\u2019s completely stuffing her pockets with her cause.\u201d But you are not doing that [Newkirk earned $32,000 from PETA in 2005] and the film makes that clear; so instead, the criticism is that you are sad and obsessed.\nDS: You\u2019re either milking it for all it is worth\u2014\nDS: What do you think drives people to jump at negative spin?\nDS: Where do you draw your strength from? What\u2019s behind that question is when I was in law school I did a Chihuahua rescue and helped to save perhaps 15 to 20 dogs. I thought it would be a great fulfilling thing, and it would be easy to do to host these animals while I read my law books. Instead, it was grueling. It ended up tearing me apart\u2014\nDS: --watching your film I thought, \u201cI would be a terrible investigator. I would be like the guy in the movie who simply couldn\u2019t do it.\u201d I saw a 14-pound dog that was raped by a man and her insides were torn up; I had a dog who almost died on me because it had been so severely starved and beaten, and the only thing I could do to get it to survive was to take a syringe full of blended dog food liquidated with heavy cream and feed it while it bit my fingers. It took its toll on me and it was one of the things that made me very down on humanity\u2014\nDS: But it was hurtful.\nDS: Where do you draw your strength to continue on and to not hate humanity?\nDS: Animals don\u2019t scheme.\nDS: You do have a great memory.\nDS: Yes, I do know."}

The action by postal workers, teachers, air traffic controllers and hospital staff, have left many schools closed and airports facing delays and flight cancellations.\nThe November 2007 strikes in France began when SNCF rail workers and Paris M\u00e9tro engineers went on strike to protest reforms by President Nicolas Sarkozy, which would reduce early retirement pensions.\nUnder current regulations, civil servants in France may retire after 37.5 years of service. Some professions, primarily in the rail industry, have an accelerated schedule, allowing rail workers to retire as early as age 50 with full benefits. The government wants to change that saying that these special pensions apply to 1.6 million workers and amount to 6% of the governments total pension payments.\nThe rail strike has, according to opinion polls, become quite unpopular. Speaking today, Sarkozy said \"I am thinking about those millions of French people who after a day's work do not have a bus, a metro or a train to get home and who are tired of being held hostage. I am thinking of those companies that risk having to lay off workers.\"\nThe French finance minister Christine Lagarde estimated the strikes cost the economy of France \u20ac350 million each day. \"It's a real worry for the French economy,\" she said. Public accounts minister \u00c9ric W\u0153rth spoke on France Inter radio and agreed that a prolonged strike would hurt the economy. \"Not over several days. But if it lasted longer, it could obviously have consequences,\" he said.\nThe civil servants that began their 24-hour stoppage today are protesting what they say has been a de facto pay-cut. The purchasing power of their wages has dropped by 6% since 2000. They are demanding pay-raises and are protesting proposed job-cuts for 2008. The government has proposed to cut some 23,000 jobs, half of which would be in education.\nThe third work stoppage by French energy workers started last night, reducing electrical output by 9%. Newspaper distributors also went on strike, in protest of proposed restructuring. Students protested other reforms that would give universities greater autonomy. The students blocked access to buildings at campuses across the country."}

This was the second phase of a three phase project to complete the connection of the Harmony module to the rest of the Space Station. Whitson, who is ISS's first female Commander, exclaimed \"Yay, got it!\" after finishing a particularly difficult section of the hand-intensive project. The goal of the 7+ hour was to complete the connection of the power and heating cables and the fluid lines between the space station and the Harmony laboratory which the delivered to the space station last month.\nDuring the dangerous spacewalk, the spacewalkers removed the fluid lines (which carry ammonia in an 18\u00bd-foot (5.6 m), 300-pound (136 kg) tray) and removed the tray from its storage location on the space station, then lugged it over to Harmony and bolted it down. The tray, which was awkward to carry, required the astronauts to take turns carrying it over to Harmony being careful not to bang it around. A frightening moment occurred during the venting of the hook ups that saw frozen ammonia crystals floating out and bouncing off of Whitson. NASA Mission Control explained to her that it was nothing to worry about at the time and that procedures would take place later. These decon procedures include brushing off the toxic substance and letting the sun bake it off.\nThe station's three astronauts have been working continuously since the Space Shuttle Discovery departed on the 5 November 2007 to get the new lab attached. The next shuttle mission is scheduled to lift off on 6 December 2007 with a new laboratory that will dock to Harmony, but the shuttle cannot commence its mission until Harmony is completely attached. A third and final Harmony space walk is scheduled for Saturday 24 November 2007 to attach the final fluid tray and complete connections to the Harmony lab."}

HMRC were not informed that the original discs had been lost until 8 November, and Darling himself was informed on 10 November.\nThe violation of data protection laws involved in the creation of the discs has led to strong attacks on the government's competence to establish the proposed National Identity Register, when all UK residents will have an identity card. Conservative Shadow Chancellor George Osborne described the loss of data as \"catastrophic\" and said \"They [the government] simply cannot be trusted with people's personal information\".\nThe Chairman of HMRC, Paul Gray, has resigned over the affair, and critics are calling for Darling to do likewise.\nThis is the third data embarrassment for HMRC in recent weeks \u2014 earlier this month it was reported that the details of over 15,000 Standard Life customers had been put on disk, and then lost en route from HMRC in Newcastle to Standard Life in Edinburgh \u2014 and last month a laptop containing the data of 400 people with high-value ISAs was stolen from the boot of a car belonging to a HMRC official who had been carrying out a routine audit."}

He compared brands trend between Taiwan and other world-wide countries with \"The World Is Flat\" and proved the trend of optimization on global companies with his \"Smiling Curve\" theory. \"We (the public) should determine a brand good or failure by its quality, nature, and notability but not its scale.\" Shih said and stressed, \"Companies with MIT brands (OBMs) can't always be ODMs or OEMs because some (people) often confused on conceptions and basis of 'Branding Taiwan' and 'Taiwan Brands'.

A brand's or a product's nature can be known with differences on consumers' population. Of course, in Taiwan or other world-wide countries, every self-made brand or product has its style, nature, and characteristics.\"\nIn the final of Panel Discussion, 3 main speakers think that \"Smiling Curve\" theory is a key factor to determine a company pursue its \"brand value\" success or failure.

City councillors are accused of showing up for a game with only one ticket, but demanding that two or more people be allowed entry. Several baseball fans in Taiwan protested to the Taichung City Government yesterday. A witness to this scandal, who recorded its process, was threatened by some councilors and hooligans in Taichung City. However, this might be a rumor because some facts are uncertain. A Taichung City Councilor Hsiao Chieh threatened Chinese Taipei Baseball Association (CTBA) with canceling the budget for the 2007 Asian Baseball Championship. In regards to the rumors of a threat that were mentioned above, internet users in Taiwan criticized Councilors with \"not wanting to admit their mistakes\" and \"exhibiting very ugly behavior.\"\nAccording to the United Daily News in Taiwan, an internet user alleged that a councilor, who was involved in this scandal, claimed his behavior was in \"service to the voters\". CTBA and Taichung City Government announced to the media that \"The scandal was just a misunderstanding\" and that \"those councillors and voters all had tickets, not bullies\" extremely. \nEven though this scandal is still being investigated by the police, some fans and citizens are worried that public security organizations and the government will be negligent in their handling of this scandal. They fear the truth of the culprit will never be revealed. The public hopes Taichung City Government will take responsibility for this scandal as soon as possible."}

The three were found guilty of acquiring triacetone triperoxide (TATP) in order to make bombs. TATP is believed to have been the explosive used in the London bombings of July 7, 2005.\nTwo of the men are Danish citizens. Mohammad Zaher, age 34, is a Dane of Palestinian origin. Abdallah Andersen, age 32, is a Dane who converted to Islam. Ahmed Khaldhahi, age 22, is an Iraqi of Kurdish ethnicity. The fourth defendant, also a Danish citizen, Riad Anwar Daabas, age 19, was acquitted. \nZaher and Khaldhahi were each sentenced to eleven years in prison, while Andersen received a four year sentence. All had faced life in prison, but the prosecutor asked for no more than 14 years.\nThe evidence against the men included a bomb-making manual and about two ounces of TATP found at Zaher's home, as well as, wire-tapped conversations which were made possible by an uncover agent known only as \"Lars\".\n\"Lars\", age 33, is a Dane that converted to Islam. He contacted Politiets Efterretningstjeneste (PET), the national security intelligence agency of Denmark, after he encountered radical Muslims at the mosque he attended. The PET did acknowledge that \"Lars\" was a paid informant, with payments totalling some DKK84,000 (approximately US$16,700).\nThe defense, which denied the charges, argued that the recordings were made of them while they were joking about possible attacks. The defense also said that \"Lars\" was the one that bought and paid for the chemicals needed to make TATP. They also said that \"Lars\" encouraged them to do and say things they would otherwise not have done or said.\nHowever, Judge Folmer Theilmann found that the anonymous witness \"Lars\" was both \"credible\" and a \"good citizen\" for his cooperation with the PET.\n\"There is every indication that the group had concrete and serious discussions about three possible targets in Copenhagen: the city hall square, the parliament and political meeting (areas),\" said prosecutor Charlotte Alsing Juul.\nMagnus Ranstorp, an expert on terrorism, said to \"Berlingske Tidende\": \"The length of the sentences sends a clear signal, that if one sets out on this course of action, one risks severe punishments. It can contribute to discourage young muslims, who are entering a radical islamic milieu or are on the verge. Hopefully, they will think twice and change course.\"\nRanstorp went on to say that the verdict was a validation of the investigative methods of the PET and its use of civilian informants. However, he thought that the criticism of \"Lars\" during this case, would result in the PET tightening their procedures.\nThe defendants were arrested on September 5, 2006, in a sting operation that involved 400 police officers. Nine people were arrested in the Vollsmose neighborhood of Odense, on the island of Funen (\"Fyn\"). Two were released the day after the arrest. Four others, including Daabas, were released later.

This time, the Taipei City Government has battled to the Executive Yuan with some opinion on the \"Gate of Great Centrality and Perfect Uprightness\" in the Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall and the voting process of the Legislative Elections.\nIn fact, the conflicts on the naming issue from Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall to National Taiwan Democracy Memorial Hall was never a hot topic because governments like Executive Yuan still supported the movement of \"Removing Chiang-Kai-shek-related things\". After the Ministry of Education planned to remove four Chinese Words in the \"Gate of Great Centrality and Perfect Uprightness\", the Taipei City Mayor Lung-pin Hau was angered over this.

The Premier of ROC Chun-hsiung Chang stressed: \"If any division violates our (meant to Executive Yuan) policy to hold the Legislative Elections, and \"officials in those divisions won't get the retirement payment in the future!\" This word caused conflicts between the two main Coalitions. With some rumors on the \"Protest\" and Chen Shui-bian was registered currently in Taipei City, Chen angered those opposes and directly said: \"I would like to confiscate elections on those DAMN (meant to Pan-Blue) divisions.\"\nAs Hau replied, \"Rather not giving any votes\" to Chen, Chen replied to Hau again: \"What a DAMN world? What a DAMN place? What a DAMN mayor? What's the hell? What a DAMN innocence? The public have rights to vote, why NOT to give votes?

The Canadian-based program presents the news completely bare, with little exception, including a segment they present outside naked.

Gabriel Pollard, writing for \"Wikinews\", interviewed Victoria Sinclair about the \u201csensual, but not sexual\u201d Naked News, and her presenting role.\nThe show had a fairly basic start, with two friends, Fernando Perreira and Kirby Stasnyk, bluntly thinking that the news would be better presented naked. Sinclair said, \u201cIn this case, these men had the means and the will to turn their idea into reality.\u201d A Russian program with a similar concept, \"600 seconds\" on M1 TV, in which news anchor Svetlana Pesotskaya removed an article of clothing after each story, received high ratings within eight months of its introduction in 1999. Naked Broadcasting Network Inc. also started a male edition in 2001, but this was discontinued a few years later due to lack of interest from its key demographic, the gay community. It failed to get the same kind of grounding experienced by the female edition. Later imitators in Hong Kong and Japan have also proved successful.\nIn 1999\u2014its inception\u2014Naked News only had around 8,000 subscribers of a free five-minute show hosted on Daily Dirt. They now boast six million paid subscribers to a much longer news program of 22-minutes produced every six days from 172 countries worldwide. Lead Anchor and spokeswoman Victoria Sinclair puts the success of the international viewership due to the \u201ccaptivating, saucy, and certainly different\u201d way of presenting the news, \u201cThat certainly counts when the news is bad\u2014which it often is.\u201d The public loves the format, and have become \u201cquite attached\u201d to the anchors, says 38-year-old Sinclair.\n\u201cI believe the secret to our success is that we challenged the accepted boundaries while keeping it clean and tasteful.\n\u201cI think the way has been paved for us by mainstream journalism; we would never have been embraced so eagerly by the world if it weren\u2019t well prepared.\u201d\nSinclair says the reason she got attracted to the Naked News program in the first place was because of its originality, and it felt \u201cvery adventurous and underground.\u201d \u201cI think we have a friendlier way of delivering the news...\u201d\nAs well as the show being streamed onto the Internet, another version of the show called Naked News TV! is also available on pay-per-view in the United States, Europe, Canada, Australia, etc. Naked News TV! is a weekly 50-minute show and marks Naked News' success at porting over from the Internet to television.\nWhile Sinclair has been presenting Naked News since the pilot programme in May 1999 \u2013 production started in December 1999 \u2013 she can't see herself doing anything else, unless it is equally as \u201cunusual\u201d, involves technology, and the Internet. However, she did take a year sabbatical after 9/11. She left her previous job of marketing because it was no longer fulfilling. Sinclair plans to continue her anchoring role in Naked News, and holding a position of Public Relations, as the show expands into the new markets of South Korea and Italy until the time comes that she looks better non-nude.\nHer \u201cloving and supportive\u201d family and friends are entirely supportive of her current profession. \u201cThey are all accustomed to me as it is through their influence that I have become such an independent freethinker.\u201d"}

From working in a dollar store in her hometown of Whitby, Ontario, to modeling haute couture in Toronto, she had reached her dream of becoming a true Top Model.\nBut at what cost? Unknown to casual television viewers, Muizelaar had been enveloped in the eating disorder anorexia nervosa, which inevitably became too much for her to bear. She gave up modeling and moved back to Whitby, where she sought treatment for her disorder, re-entered college, and now works at a bank. Where is she now? Happy and healthy, she says.\nRecently Andrea Muizelaar sat down with Wikinews reporter in a candid interview that stretched to nearly two hours, as she told all about her hopes and aspirations, her battle with anorexia, and just what \"really\" happened on \"Canada's Next Top Model.\"\nAndrea's beginnings.\nMike Halterman: Tell us a bit about your background. We know all about the Andrea we saw on Top Model, but we're interested to hear where you came from. What do your parents do? Did you have any hard times growing up?\nMH: How geeky are we talking here? Worse than any other teenager?\nMH: How long did that last?\nMH: What happened after that point? Did they stop, or did you grow into your looks, or was it something else?\nMH: This was also around the time you wanted to model, right?\nMH: Is that when you first became anorexic?\nAndrea on her road to modeling, and \"America's Next Top Model\".\nMH: Who were the people you looked up to and inspired you to pursue modeling? Did they have that thin body type that you hoped to have?\nMH: That was actually going to be my next question. Who did you look up to on that show?\nMH: Some of the plus sized girls on that show actually went into rather lucrative careers, like Toccara from Cycle 3, probably more so than some of the thinner winners. How do you feel about that, and how would you have felt about such an event occurring before you overcame your anorexia?\nMH: Definitely. On that note, do you feel there is such a thing as \"perfect\" in terms of image in fashion?\nMH: Even with the Toccaras and Tyra Banks of the world?\nMH: That is true. Do you think Tyra Banks picks the bigger models for \"good TV\" instead of actually succeeding in modeling?\nMH: There was a big hype over Tyra picking Whitney and Diana for ANTM 8, which was the first time two plus sized girls made it into the final rounds. They were both eliminated midway through the competition. That year Jaslene won. Do you think her look is unhealthy in terms of how it's promoted to the public and young girls?\nMH: Do you believe the producers for shows such as Top Model intentionally pick people who are perhaps unstable, whether it be with body image or otherwise?\nExperience on \"Canada's Next Top Model\".\nMH: This question was asked by Steff Groulx, who was on Canada's Next Top Model, Cycle 2. \"Do you think the experience you had on the show was what you thought it would be?\"\nMH: In the third episode, the photographer who was the guest judge that week made a comment that he wanted to take you \"to get something to eat,\" and then criticized fellow contestant Natalie for being \"a bit big\" for modeling. Did you feel you had the worst criticism, or do you think it was evenly spread out among all the girls?\nMH: Right, you had some big concerns. Ylenia also had self-image concerns while on the show, but we don't know of her full story. Do you still keep in contact with her, and if so, is she in a better state of mind now?\nMH: Tricia Helfer hired a personal trainer for an episode, and he told you to revise your diet and to gain weight in your backside and in your thighs. Were you afraid to listen to him or did you mentally process his tips but were hesitant anyway?\nMH: He was also the same guest who memorably destroyed a scale with a sledgehammer. Since Tricia Helfer invited him, do you feel that she was sincere about wanting all the contestants to be healthy? Did she know you had an eating disorder?\nMH: After the Pantene photo shoot, at panel, all the judges criticized your weight, specifically that you didn't weigh enough, and you later became defensive and said you ate well. This was interspersed with an interview from Alanna who said she never saw you eat a full meal the entire time you were in the house. The mantra quickly became \"Andrea, you need to eat!\" Now my question is, do you feel that they truly cared about whether you ate or not, and do you think that mantra was just an excuse to go, \"Well, I did say she needed to eat...\"?\nMH: What would you hypothesize is the reason for the disconnect between the fashion industry's definitions of \"health,\" \"attractiveness,\" and \"beauty,\" and what most people, completely unrelated to the fashion industry, would see as healthy, attractive and beautiful?\nMH: Twiggy herself has noted that models were more full-figured and traditionally \"beautiful\" before she came along, and that she thinks she may be a trend-setter in that regard. If you believe that's true, then do you think that she should be telling other potential models how to fit in \"the mold,\" since she was the one who broke it in the first place?\nMH: In your opinion, who do you think had the bigger impact? Is it one model? A series of models?\nMH: But you don't feel it's correct for Twiggy to \"claim ownership\" of today's \"model look,\" as it were?\nMH: Do you feel that there are certain good qualities that the fashion industry has, and if so, what are they?\nMH: Alanna was bigger than you were, but still rather average in terms of everyday women. If she had won and not you, do you think she would have had a tougher time breaking into high fashion?\nMH: Alanna was a very strong competitor. Do you feel the final two was a good choice, or should someone else have taken Alanna's place?\nMH: One constant criticism by the judges and by fans was that you lacked confidence, and certain times in the series you questioned why you were competing against girls you felt were \"better than you.\" Why did you feel that way? Was your body image a factor, and if so, how much of a factor? What other factors were there in the way you felt?\nMH: The CityTV final episode online viewer poll had the question \"Should Andrea have won CNTM?\" and the response was overwhelmingly in favor of \"No, Andrea shouldn't have been CNTM! She's too skinny and the crying gets annoying!\" Was hiding your anorexia the reason why you were as emotional as you were?\nMH: You made a comment during the series that you felt Stacey McKenzie was the most critical and belittling of the judges. Toward the second half of the competition, you spent an entire afternoon alone with her at the house and it was shown that you two bonded. Do you feel that day really made you feel better about how Stacey viewed you? \nMH: Please elaborate. Her \"true colors\" in what sense?\nMH: Which judge do you feel was perhaps the most genuine in terms of behavior on-screen and off?\nMH: There's been criticism on America's Next Top Model that Tyra Banks and the care that she shows to her models is an act for TV. Do you think Tricia Helfer is the opposite?\nMH: Jay Manuel now hosts, and it's weird to see because he's in a different mode than he is on America's Next Top Model, where he's often very blunt and sarcastic. [...] Toward the end, there was a lot of rather cruel teasing towards you coming from Alanna and Brandi. As you may remember, it culminated in the night they went through your belongings and then tampered with a \"treat\" they prepared for you and Sisi. It wasn't a complete 180 in behavior, per se, but it did get very nasty very quickly. Why do you think they acted the way they did? Also, you were never shown confronting them for what they did. Did you end up doing so? Finally, did you know the extent of all they had done right away, or did you not find out until you actually saw the episode on television?\nMH: What did the producers say? On TV, due to editing, it comes across as Alanna and Brandi deciding to be nosy and poke through your things.\nMH: And they didn't know you had any before that time?\nMH: After the final runway show, you did a private interview and you said something that stuck out. \"I have learned so much about being a woman, about being a model, about being beautiful.\" Considering what happened to you during the competition and later on, do you still feel what you learned was genuine? If not, what do you feel isn't genuine, and what good things did you bring from the experience?\nThe message she wrote to her fans on her facebook group.\nMH: You wrote that you decided to audition for Canada's Next Top Model knowing that you would have to perpetuate an image of unhealthiness and false images of beauty. Why did you choose to go down that road if you knew of the risks?\nMH: You seem to describe a battle of what you wanted more, which in this case, modeling almost won out over your health. What finally made you realize that modeling became too much to bear, and why did modeling mean that much to you?\nMH: When your health faltered, that's when you said, \"No, I can't do this anymore\"?\nMH: Do you feel that there should have been more of a fine line drawn between the money you received, between \"prize\" and \"work,\" for tax purposes?\nMH: You discuss many horrible housing situations during your reign as Top Model. Were you not allowed to make your own decisions as far as housing was concerned?\nHer brief modeling career.\nMH: Your spread in \"Fashion\" magazine only paid $500. Is that a competitive rate for models or do you feel that you were paid less because you were under your television contract?\nMH: Why do you feel CityTV did not back you, as you say they were going to, during the lawsuit with your previous agency?\nMH: The Canadian website Canoe said you had alleged that Jeanne Beker, a judge on the show, effectively \"ruined your career.\" Can you elaborate on what was meant by that, and do you indeed feel she ruined your career?\nMH: A big criticism of Top Model winners is that they don't go on to do many big fashion-related events, such as runway shows or photoshoots. Do you feel that was the case with you? In the year you did pursue modeling, who did you model for, and what shows did you walk in?\nMH: Another question from Steff Groulx from CNTM 2: \"Why did you go from wanting to be Canada's Next Top Model to not wanting it at all?\"\n\"Happy and healthy\".\nMH: You're going back to college for business administration. What do you want to do with your degree?\nMH: How do you feel when people tell you that you looked so beautiful in your modeling pictures back when you had anorexia?\nMH: Do you feel you've fully grown into your \"own skin,\" so to speak, as far as your self-confidence goes now that you have left modeling?\nMH: When you have a daughter of your own and she wants to become a model, would you approve of her choice to go into modeling?\nMH: Finally, what is your message to the girls of Canada who have big dreams of their own? What would you tell them?"}

A majority of the afflicted have been children under the age of 15. There have been no deaths attributed directly to the disorder.\nAccording to a statement in the state-run \"AngolaPress\", symptoms have included \"sleepiness, blear-eyedness, dizziness and difficulty to speak, walk and extreme tiredness.\" WHO described the drowsiness as being so severe that the patient would require \"painful stimuli\" to be awoken.\nResults from laboratory tests carried out in London and Munich indicated elevated levels of bromide present in the blood and kitchen salt samples examined. It is suspected that sodium chloride (table salt) may have been contaminated with sodium bromide, an agent used in pharmaceuticals and industry.\nHowever, authorities caution that more investigation is required to determine the source and cause of the illness. Consequently, further testing of blood, food and water has been initiated.\nOn Wednesday, WHO dispatched additional technical and support personnel to Angola to assist local health officials."}

The meeting, the product of months of Middle East diplomacy by the Bush administration, is intended to reopen peace talks between the two sides for the first time in seven years.\nThe conference, hosted by the United States Department of State, has been dubbed the Annapolis Conference. \"Our purpose here in Annapolis is not to conclude an agreement. Rather, it is to launch negotiations between the Israelis and Palestinians,\" said President George W. Bush at the first formal session of the conference. \"The time is right, the cause is just, and with hard effort, I know they can succeed.\"\nBush said that direct negotiations for a Palestinian state will begin December 12. \"Such a state will provide Palestinians with the chance to lead lives of freedom, purpose and dignity,\" Bush said. He hopes a solution be found before he leaves office.\nAs the summit got underway, thousands of people demonstrated in Gaza City. \"Let them go to a thousand conferences, we say in the name of the Palestinian people that we did not authorise anyone to sign any agreement that harms our rights,\" said Mahmoud al-Zahar, a co-founder of Hamas.

The demonstrators gathered in front of the building hours before the debate was to begin and later staged a sit-down protest in the building's halls. Only half of the people who had tickets to the debate were able to enter the building due to the protests.

The protest was organized by the activist group Unite Against Fascism, as well as members of the Oxford University Student Union and Oxford's Jewish and Muslim societies.\nLuke Tryl, president of the Oxford Union, defended the decision to allow Irving to speak, saying that the purpose of the debate was to discuss the limits of free speech, not to give the speakers a platform from which to endorse their views. Ned Temko, chief political correspondent of \"The Observer\", disagreed, saying, \"It's not a question about giving them a platform, it's about giving them credibility.\"\nFrom February to December 2006, David Irving was jailed in Austria after being convicted of identifying with the Nazi Party. He has written several books which deny the Holocaust and support the views of Adolf Hitler. In 1998, an English court found that he is \"an active Holocaust denier; that he is anti-Semitic and racist and that he associates with right-wing extremists who promote neo-Nazism.\" Nick Griffin is the National Chairman of the British National Party, a nationalist group known for its anti-immigration and anti-Muslim policies.

The organizers still chose one, named Mukmuk, as their \"virtual only\" counterpart.\nAfter the Olympic logo design was leaked the day before the 2005 announcement, organizers were extremely tight lipped until today's news conference at a Surrey school. They apparently didn't do any development on the characters on internet-enabled computers, to ensure the images or information wouldn't slip out.\nThe characters were designed by the Vancouver and Los Angeles-based Meomi Design. Their characters have been used as part of iGoogle, a customizable homepage option from Google, as well as Electronic Arts, Girls Inc., Time Out Magazine, Cyworld, Nick Jr., Bang-on Clothing, and CBC4Kids.\nThe Vancouver organizers have a CDN$46-million merchandising program; previous Olympics have made as much as $100 million from mascot-related products.\nRen\u00e9 Fasel, Chairman of the International Olympic Committee's (IOC) Coordination Commission commented that \"The IOC welcomes these imaginative new additions to the Olympic Family as they take their place on the world stage today - a symbol of the Games and of Canada. We know that when Olympians, Paralympians and visitors from around the globe arrive in British Columbia at Games time, they will fall under the spell of these captivating characters.\"\nThe characters first appearance will be at a Bay store in the Lower Mainland; HBC is a major sponsor of the Games. They will then make their way to schools, take a break through the Christmas season, and fly to Ottawa for the Winterlude festival.\nResponse to designs.\nMany respondents on the CBC.ca forums complained that the characters were poorly designed, and objected to the anime influence. One early commenter posted: \"these mascots do represent BC very well... someone must have been smoking A LOT of BC bud when they created these things. Maybe the dealer was that marmot that no one can see.\"\nOne poster suggests the Miga character is inaccurate: \"Family pods are residential (not transients or offshore!) who prefer sheltered water.\" According to the poster, they are \"rarely seen\" on the west coast of Vancouver Island, where Tofino is.\nOne forum poster took offense to the characters: \"As a person ... of full First Nations descent I want to say that these mascots are offensive.\"\nSome felt that they were a nice change of pace, from the \"regular run-of-the-mill Canadiana that has been recycled over and over again. Vancouver is a new city for new things and fresh faces, a place for experimentation... I think we need to remember that these characters are for the kids and for fun. What kind of a statement would trotting out another red and white beaver and moose make? That we are imaginative with new ideas? They'll grow on us.\"\nEarlier logo design a dud say some.\nNative offense to the Vancouver Olympic mascots would not be unheard of.\nWhile the Olympic logo was applauded by various First Nations and Inuit leaders, including the Nunavut premier, one criticized the image for the Games as looking like the video game character Pac Man. Local leaders complained it didn't represent their cultures, but the culture of the far north; interestingly the logo designer was of sure Haida ancestry.\nNunavut Commissioner Peter Irniq complained that traditional inuksuit (inuksuk) never had a head, legs, or arms. Irniq says that the logo resembles an inunguat, which is a much more recent invention made by non-Inuit people in Nunavut.\nRoughly 1600 designs were submitted. Similarly, the mascot design process was open to all, but there was no word yet on numbers of entrants.\nThe British Columbian chapter of the Society of Graphic Designers of Canada took issue with the \"token\" amount of money paid to the winner, compared to the work done and the fact the images were those of VANOC in perpetuity, with no usage fees paid. VANOC later approached the Society, to set minimum standards for the design."}

Out of 8 names, including Abdullah and Hassan, the children overwhelmingly voted for Muhammad, by 20 votes to 3.\nThe bear was named back in September, as part of a teaching assignment. Each weekend a child would take it home, and write a diary of what they had done with the bear. These accounts were collected in a book with a picture of the teddy on the front, along with the message \"My name is Muhammad\". The bear itself was not labeled or marked with the name.\nOn Sunday, November 25, as a group of angry men chanted threats, the police arrested Ms Gibbons at her lodgings in the School. The book has also been seized, and police want to question the bear's 7 year old owner.\nSince her arrest she has been moved from a local police station to Sudan's Criminal Investigation Department headquarters for interrogation. British consular officials were initially refused permission to see her, but were allowed to leave food and water. Colleagues from the school have however been able to visit, and consular access was eventually provided. \nThe British embassy in Khartoum has not been able to confirm whether the teacher has formally been charged.\nSchool reaction.\nDirector Robert Boulos has closed the school until January for fear of reprisals. \"This is a very sensitive issue,\" he said.\nHe stressed that there was no deliberate insult: \"This was a completely innocent mistake. Miss Gibbons would have never wanted to insult Islam.\" Mr Boulos was also confident she would not face a jail sentence.\nHowever, in an statement sent to last night, Unity High School announced that Mrs Gibbons' employment with the school was being terminated with immediate effect:\nThe Sudanese Media Centre, which is linked to the government, reports that that Ms Gibbons' actions had \"met with wide condemnation by guardians of the students\", but colleagues of Ms Gibbons claimed that no such complaints had been received by any of the children's parents. \nLegal escalation.\nSudan's Justice Minister, Mohammed Ali Mardhi, ordered General Prosecutor Salaheddin Abu Zaid to take personal charge of the case. \nIf charged with insulting the Prophet Muhammad, regarded as under Sudan's Sharia law, Ms Gibbons faces 40 lashes or six month's imprisonment - but the prosecutor has suggested that more serious charges could follow. He is continuing to question witnesses, and there are unconfirmed reports that blasphemy charges have already been brought, and that charges of sedition are being considered.\nInternational reaction.\nThe British Prime Minister, Gordon Brown, expressed sorrow about what has happened to Ms Gibbons, and stated that contacts had been made with the Sudanese government and police to \"clarify\" the situation.\n, Labour MP for , called for the release of Ms Gibbons, stating: \"I hope that the Foreign Office will do everything they can to calm the situation.

Google plans to spend tens of millions of dollars on research and development in 2008, and to invest hundreds of millions of dollars to bring energy projects to market.\nThe new initiative is dubbed \"RE&lt;C\", for \"Renewable Energy Cheaper than Coal.\" It will \"focus initially on advanced solar thermal power, wind power technologies, enhanced geothermal systems and other potential breakthrough technologies,\" according to the company's press release.\n\"We see technologies we think can mature into very capable industries that can generate electricity cheaper than coal, and we don\u2019t see people talking about that as much as we would like,\" said Google Co-founder Larry Page. \"Solar thermal technology, for example, provides a very plausible path to providing renewable energy cheaper than coal... We are aware of several promising technologies, and believe there are many more out there.\"\nPage said that Google's goal is \"to produce one gigawatt of renewable energy capacity that is cheaper than coal,\" and that the company is \"optimistic this can be done in years, not decades.\"\nAccording to the company press release, one gigawatt is enough to power a city the size of San Franscisco.\nSome Wall Street analysts questioned the wisdom of Google's new initiative.\n\"I\u2019ve written off Google\u2019s competition as a threat to Google\u2019s long-term market share gains,\" said Jordan Rohan of RBC Capital Markets. \"But I haven\u2019t written off Google\u2019s own ability to stretch too far and try to do too much. Ultimately, that is the biggest risk in the Google story.\"\nRohan added that \"The only positive byproduct of this project that would be anything other than environmental is that it might make Google managers and executives even prouder of the fact that they work there, and it may help retain key employees who think their goal is to do good in the world.\"\nTravis Bradford, an analyst for Prometheus Institute for Sustainable Development, said he was having \"a bit of trouble trying to figure out the business logic\" of Google's move. \"They don't have any advantage in doing this other than a big, huge pile of cash.\" \nOn the other hand, Brett Conrad, manager of the Blue Earth Fund, said that Google's $211 billion market capitalization and $13 billion cash \"gives them a fighting chance\" at succeeding in the energy market. \"I think they're looking at a $7 trillion market.

However, for the first time, unrest was reported outside of Paris suburbs. The southern city of Toulouse saw at least ten cars torched and a library was set on fire.\n\"The situation is much calmer than the two previous nights but we can all feel that it remains fragile,\" said Prime Minister Fran\u00e7ois Fillon, as Tuesday night saw only minor incidents in Villiers-le-Bel, where the unrest originated on Sunday.\nAuthorities are saying that the rioting has been more intense than in 2005, albeit less widespread. There have been several reports of hunting rifles and other firearms.\n\"It's much more violent than in 2005,\" said Patrick Ribeiro of Synergie police union, in a telephone interview with Bloomberg. \"They've shot at us with handguns and hunting rifles. If our officers have to protect their lives, they may have to shoot and that's not what we want.\"\n\"Back then, it was more of a revolt. This time, they're after us and they're armed,\" said Christophe, a police officer, to \"The Guardian\".\n\"Those who shoot at policemen, those who beat a police officer almost to death are criminals and must be treated as such,\" PM Fillon told the parliament earlier in the day.\nInterior Minister Mich\u00e8le Alliot-Marie said that the riots were organized and that the street violence by teens was to distract police, while criminals looted shops. She also pledged stronger police presence. \"Our goal is to impose calm and to arrest these dangerous individuals who shoot at police,\" she said.\n\"I was there yesterday, and I'm going to be there tonight,\" said a 19-year-old who lives in Villiers-le-Bel where the accident happened and who would not give his name. \"We don't think it's a good thing to destroy the shops, but we're in this all together. And we won't stop until justice is made.\"\nMeanwhile, the police reported their initial findings in the investigation into the accident that triggered the unrest. The motorcycle was going at top speed and was not registered for street use, while the two boys were not wearing helmets and had been ignoring traffic rules, according to the report. The two boys have been identified only by their first names. Moushin, 15, and Larami, 16, both died in the accident.\nRelatives of the boys insist that the police rammed the motorcycle with their car and then left the boys to die. Residents have said that police gave only cursory help to the accident victims. Police say that an ambulance was on the scene within 10 minutes of the collision."}

NASA's Landsat 7 satellite took 10,000 photographs of the continent over a period of two years, from 1999 to 2001. 1,100 pictures were chosen to form the mosaic map. Officially titled the Landsat Image Mosaic of Antarctica (LIMA), the map reveals Antarctica's geography in high definition and with accurate colors. Details as small as half the size of a basketball court are visible. \nNASA created the map to coincide with the International Polar Year of 2007-2008. Robert Bindschadler, chief scientist of the Hydrospheric and Biospheric Sciences Laboratory at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, remarked, \u201cThis innovation is like watching high-definition TV in living color versus watching the picture on a grainy black-and-white television.\u201d The map represents a tenfold improvement over previous Antarctic imagery databases. \nLandsat 7 managed to capture 80% of the continent in high definition. While the satellite was not able to take photographs of the South Pole due to its orbit path, lower-resolution images helped fill in the gap. \nThe map will help scientists plan and carry out expeditions on the notoriously difficult terrain. The new, intensely detailed information will also facilitate the tracking of environmental changes such as the calving of ice shelves. Researchers will be able to use such data to better understand phenomena like global warming in such amazing detail that even relatively small changes will be visible. Geologists, on the other hand, will be able to use the maps to study Antarctic rock formations.\nThe LIMA images are available to the public via the internet. The National Science Foundation contributed nearly US$1 million to create the website.\nThe Landsat 7 satellite will continue to document Antarctica from space through to 2011. Subsequently, NASA will launch the Landsat Data Continuity Mission. Information from both projects will update the map."}

The video also shows the memo projected onto a screen, in nearly 20 slides, so that the attendees of the briefing can see it in detail.\nMaebus, who says he is at the briefing \"on behalf of his boss Charles Allen,\" who is the chief intelligence officer and former CIA member of 50 years, talks about \"threats to the homeland\" and begins to go into detail about alleged foiled terror plots involving bombs, and individuals overseas. The briefing was held on or around the date of October 22, 2007, and the alleged plots and threats not mentioned in the memo, took place within the \"past few weeks,\" says Maebus.\nOne incident Maebus describes that is not mentioned in the report involves the \"arrest of at least two college students in South Carolina that were pulled over by the State Police\" for reasons Maebus did not describe. Those arrests lead to more \"arrests in Denmark of two individuals plus a couple of others,\" who, according to Maebus, were \"building TATP bombs,\" which are made from a peroxide in the form of a white powder, that has a primary use as a high explosive.\nAfter the arrests in Denmark, Maebus says that a short time later, several more arrests of four men were made in Germany. They are accused of plotting to blow up U.S. military installations and interests inside Germany. At least 700lbs of the same TATP explosive were confiscated from the men by German authorities. Maebus says the peroxide \"was ready to cook off\" and be made into \"500 kilograms\" of material ready to be used for a bomb.\n\"These threats [and plots] are real, and [there are more] out there,\" added Maebus.\nMaebus also says that there is evidence that \"European extremists\" are going to Iraq and \"learned their trade craft, and then have come out and applied it elsewhere.\" Maebus claims that these extremists can \"take their operations to Europe, or come to the U.S.,\" but also says there is no \"evidence\" that they have done this or \"are thinking about doing that, but we are very concerned about the potential\" of it happening.\nMaebus also goes on to claim that there is no evidence that al-Qaeda is responsible for the bombings of oil pipelines and the kidnappings of oil workers in Nigeria, but that al-Qaeda is coming down from the northern part of Africa to get involved with or take over terrorist operations in that country. Maebus does state, however; that al-Qaeda is intent on striking the oil and natural gas infastructure.\nMaebus then calls Saudi Arabia a \"mess,\" but that \"they [the Saudi government] are aware of that, and are trying to clean it up.\""}

He did not know his victim, who was a 16-year-old hairdresser apprentice. The state attorney assumes that the shooter has picked his victim randomly. The motive of the crime is not known at the moment.\nThere is an ongoing domestic debate whether soldiers should continue to keep their firearms at home.

Such a state will provide Palestinians with the chance to lead lives of freedom and purpose and dignity. Such a state will help provide the Israelis with something they have been seeking for generations: to live in peace with their neighbors.\"\nRegarding the immediate future, the joint statement said: \"President Abbas and Prime Minister Olmert will continue to meet on a bi-weekly basis to follow up the negotiations in order to offer all necessary assistance for their advancement.\" It also set a target for an agreement: \"We agree to engage in vigorous, ongoing and continuous negotiations, and shall make every effort to conclude an agreement before the end of 2008.\"\nAnalysts, however, are skeptical that the two leaders, who are both politically weakened at home, will be able to reach an agreement by the deadline. There are also doubts about how hard Bush will push them.\n\"I am not persuaded yet that they have grasped the seriousness and the amount of work that is required to do what they say they want to do\u2014to reach an agreement on the core issues by the end of the Bush administration,\" said Aaron David Miller of the Woodrow Wilson Center.\n\"Neither has the support at home or the control of his government to do something extremely serious,\" said Jon Alterman, an analyst at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\n\"There is, I think, considerable doubt remaining about whether the administration is prepared to take on the heavy lifting ... to make this work,\" said Bruce Riedel of the Brookings Institution.\n\"This was an investment of presidential prestige that we hadn't seen before,\" said Daniel Levy of the New America Foundation.

Trooper Gardner issued a citation which Massey refused to sign. After some debate about where the sign posting the speed limit was, trooper Gardner asked Massey to step out of his vehicle.\nMassey, a 28-year-old telephone company employee, appears in the video to be under the impression that he and the officer would walk back to the nearby traffic sign. Trooper Gardner appears to be under a different impression. He orders Massey, who is still pointing at the sign, to stop and then draws his taser at Massey. Massey turns and begins to walk back toward his vehicle, turning his head toward Gardner, who is now behind Massey. Massey says, \"what the heck are you doing?\" and Gardner orders him to \"turn around and put your hands behind your back.\" Massey does not and replies, \"what the heck is wrong with you?\" Shortly after, Gardner fires his taser.\nAllegedly, Gardner triggers the electrodes a second time while Massey is on the ground, but this is not entirely clear from the video. Massey's wife emerges from the vehicle, clearly distraught, but Gardner orders her to return to the vehicle under threat of \"going to jail, too.\"\nMassey filed a complaint against the UHP and obtained the video footage, which was recorded from the trooper's vehicle, in a public records request under the process of discovery. \nOn November 19, Massey posted the video on YouTube, when he felt that the UHP's internal investigation was not progressing. \"There's been no response, no action, no notifying us 'Hey, we're looking at this',\" Massey told \"Vernal Express\". \"To us it seems like they're stonewalling it; trying to brush it under the rug so that nothing would happen.\"\nThe posting on YouTube encourages people to call the UHP and express their displeasure. However, many have posted online death-threats against the trooper.\nThis is an unintended consequence, says Massey. \"I wish people would have some common decency every once in awhile [\"sic\"],\" he said in an interview with Fox on Monday. \"When I posted the video it wasn't to vilify the guy, demean him or destroy him, and that's one of the things I hate about this.\"\n\"I wish people would realize and think about this: Trooper Gardner is a real person, he's got a real family. Real lives are being affected,\" he added.\nUnder Utah law, one has to sign a citation to acknowledge receipt, whether or not one protests its validity.\nThe stated purpose of the taser is for it to be used under circumstances where use of lethal force would be the alternative. However, its use by police departments, in cases where non-lethal force would normally be used (pre-taser era), has resulted in some deaths, thereby leading the use of the device to be controversial."}

Boscawen said that \"I believe the rights that have been taken away from us go to the very heart of our democracy and you can't put money on that.\"\n\"The Government's hypocrisy [is] ... that they have put so much effort into human rights issues in Zimbabwe and Fiji while blatantly ignoring our own.\"\nBob McCroskie highlighted in his speech to the crowd that the Government does not have a suitable defence against attackers of the Bill. He spoke of one 15-year-old, that asked various MP's not to vote for the Electoral Finance Bill. One of those Simeon asked, MP Chris Carter, replied bluntly and simply asking if he was a member of the Exclusive Brethren? \"That's all he could argue against what Simeon said!\"\nMcCroskie finished off his short speech by starting a \"Kill the Bill\" chant.\nEric Crampton spoke about why this Bill is so bad. \"This is very bad legislation - so bad that, even after amendment, the New Zealand Law Society wants it scrapped. This is amazing.\" He believed it was amazing because lawyers are the ones who will benefit from the endless litigation this would produce. \"Legislation has to be shockingly bad before we'd expect lawyers to say it should be scrapped entirely, but that's what they've done.\"\nProtesters.\nAlso in attendance was Korean War veteran, Forbes Taylor. He was seen at the protest holding a placard reading, \"Our Soldiers Did Not Die For This!\"\nMember of Parliament for the New Zealand National Party, Nicky Wagner, told Gabriel Pollard that the reason National takes a strong view against the Electoral Finance Bill was because it \"restricts freedom of speech, and we don't believe people should be shut down for one year in three.\" \"[National] will probably have hundreds of amendments next week, but we believe the whole bill is flawed ... and that it is terribly bad for our democracy.\"\nA Kiwi who use to live in New Zealand, but now resides in Sydney, Australia was in town and made sure he could attend the protest. David Buckingham says he will have more rights as a New Zealander living in Australia than he would have if he was still living in New Zealand. \"As an ex-pat Kiwi living overseas, I can criticise the Government, I can campaign online. I'll be able to do all of those things and have all the rights of freedom of speech that New Zealanders will be restricted on.\" He could escape prosecution under this possible future law since he lives overseas.\nAnother protester, known only by his first name Ryan, said, \"It's all about free speech, and in a democracy, people should be free to say whatever they want.\" The New Zealand First supporter said that it doesn't matter whether people feel it's wrong or not to say it, they should still be allowed to say it. New Zealand First are voting for this Bill.\nDavid Swoss said that it is \"too much control by Labour\". Swoss voted for the ACT New Zealand party in the last election, they are one of the only two parties voting against it. He said, \"They [Labour] are trying to control too many things in society.\"\nA group of 16-year-olds shared their views on the Electoral Finance Bill to \"Wikinews\". While they are too young to vote, and will be next year in the 2008 general election as well, they all agreed that the Bill goes against our human rights. Bex Thomas, Logan Ellis, and Josh Nelson all said that they are against the Bill because of the restrictions it places on free speech. Ellis said, \"It prevents people from voicing their own opinions.\""}

The Conference is the place where formal decisions regarding the Kyoto Protocol will be made and discussed. Several participants and observers agree that getting on track for a regulatory agreement on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for 2012 onwards is going be one of the main challenges in the upcoming talks.\nSetting an agenda and a date for completion of negotiations on a post-2012 climate change agreement at the upcoming conference in Bali is of great importance, stated Yvo de Boer, Executive Secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in an interview given to Inter Press Service last week. De Boer declared that he does not \"expect Bali to agree on targets and finalise a regime\", and sees the real work in \"designing a global agreement that encompasses every country while recognising the need of different approaches with different people\" during the short span of the next two years. However, making the decision to launch negotiations is a prerequisite to this, and in that regards he says that \"...for me Bali is very much a make or a break.\"\nThe European Commission said in a press release from Tuesday: \"The [...] conference [...] must agree to launch negotiations on a comprehensive and ambitious global climate change agreement for the period after 2012, when the Kyoto Protocol's first commitment period ends.\"\nThe Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Gordon Brown stated in a speech that \"the task of Bali sounds quite specific: to launch negotiations leading to a post-2012 global agreement on climate change. But our mission is in truth historic and it is world changing\u2014to build over the next 50 years and beyond a global low carbon economy.\"\nThe United States seems to agree as the Department of State noted in a press release that \"we are committed to developing an environmentally effective and economically sustainable post-2012 framework to address climate change.\"\nIn its information for the press, the UNFCCC secretariat states that the latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report made it unmistakenably clear that the problem and danger of global warming needs to be tackled immediately, and with a world wide response. While the Kyoto Protocol includes reduction targets for the signatory developed nations through 2012, the communique says that a \"new international climate change deal must be put in place\" so that no time gap occurs between the current measures to reduce GHGs until the end of the current phase and those measures that will be applied thereafter."}

The findings, published in the journal \"Nature\" on Thursday, also confirm that there is lightning on Venus.\n\"The two planets were, in fact, very similar in the earlier days of the solar system,\" said Venus Express team scientist Hakan Svendem, \"And they have then evolved in different directions, but according to the same rules and explanations.\" Professor Fred Taylor of the University of Oxford, another scientist on the mission, said \"Our new data make it possible to construct a scenario in which Venus started out like the Earth - possibly including a habitable environment, billions of years ago - and then evolved to the state we see now.\"\nUnlike the Earth, Venus lacks a magnetic shield to protect it from the solar wind, a stream of charged particles ejected from the sun. As a result, hydrogen, helium, and oxygen are blown away from the atmosphere on Venus much faster than on Earth. The scientists believe that Venus may once have had liquid water oceans on its surface which, as a result of the solar wind, were largely removed during the first billion years after the formation of the Solar System. \"Eventually the oceans boiled off, and all the water ended up as water vapor in the atmosphere,\" Svedhem said.\nData from the magnetometer instrument on Venus Express confirm that there is lightning on Venus, a once controversial idea. In fact, the findings suggest that lightning is more common on Venus than on Earth.\nUnlike the Earth, Venus has undergone runaway greenhouse warming and now has an average surface temperature of 467 degrees Celsius. Some believe that studying how this change came about could lead to insights into how to prevent undesired climate change on Earth. \"Understanding the influencing factors of global warming on Venus could help us in mitigating the threat here on Earth,\" said United Kingdom Minister for Science and Innovation Ian Pearson."}

However, I must point out that the organisation itself is only partly responsible of our amazing success in developing and applying highly transformational and innovative technologies in the area of information. The real recognition goes to the thousands of Wikimedians, editors and developers of MediaWiki, all over the world, who have been the source and the spirit of our projects in the past seven years. The award really goes to them,\" said Chair of the WMF Board of Trustees, Florence Devouard.\n\"The nomination is a reminder of the amazing things humans can accomplish when working collaboratively and positively together. It is also the inspiration we need to continue empowering world citizens to share in the sum of all human knowledge. Allow me to use this opportunity to say to all those who have worked so hard to make Wikipedia and the other Wikimedia projects so valuable: thank you,\" added Devouard.\nAmong some of the requirements for a company to qualify or be nominated to be a technology pioneer, they must meet a certain criteria such as \"innovative technology, potential of impact on society, growth and sustainability, proof of concept, leadership and status meaning the organization cannot already be a member of the Forum or affiliated with it.\n\"By partnering with the best brains and the smartest ideas in the world, organizations can deliver innovation at the speed of their customers' lives.

A Ukrainian citizen and two Hungarians were arrested while trying to sell nearly half a kilogram of enriched uranium, Slovak police said.\nThe 481.4 grams of powdered material seized were examined by experts who determined that it was comprised of the fissile isotope uranium-235 and the common isotope uranium-238. Uranium-238 is the most abundant naturally occurring form of uranium while uranium-235 occurs naturally at approximately 0.72%. Authorities revealed preliminary results that suggest the material recovered contained 98.6% uranium-235. Uranium is considered to be weapons-grade when the uranium-235 content is at a minimum of 85%.\nPhotographs of the radioactivity measurements taken by police were shown to nuclear experts who have suggested that the uranium recovered was not likely as dangerous as authorities believe. Former UN weapons inspector David Albright downplayed the effectiveness of uranium-235 for use in a \"dirty bomb\". \"Uranium is not very radiotoxic,\" said Albright. \"The net effect of dispersing half a kilo of uranium -- who cares? Each person would get so little it would have no effect.\" \nSlovak police official Michal Kop\u010d\u00edk suggested, however, that the uranium recovered would have been useful in preparing a dirty bomb. \"The radioactive uranium was even more dangerous because it was in powder form,\" said Kop\u010d\u00edk at a news conference following the arrests. \"It was possible to use it in various ways for terrorist attacks.\"\nThe investigation and surveillance of the suspects had reportedly been going on for months. \"Police were watching the sellers as well as the buyers,\" said Kop\u010d\u00edk, although the identity of the buyers was not revealed.\nPolice said the material originated from an unspecified location in the former Soviet Union."}

During the 45 minute meeting Mr Miliband expressed \"in the strongest terms\" the government's concern at the sentence, and spoke by telephone to the Sudanese acting foreign minister.\nThe trial.\nAccording to early reports, parents had complained that Ms Gibbons had insulted the Prophet Muhammad, but when she was charged on Wednesday, this was revealed to be false. It was Sara Khawad, a secretary at the Unity High School where Ms Gibbons taught, who had complained to the Education Ministry and provoked Ms Gibbons' arrest last weekend. \nEarly Thursday morning, as vehicles filled with riot police watched the area and the press and colleagues of Ms Gibbons were denied access to the criminal courthouse in Khartoum, the trial got underway. The head of her legal team, Kamal Djizouri, was also denied access for a time. \nMs Khawad was one of four witnesses from the prosecution. Also testifying against Ms Gibbons was an accountant from the school. \nGillian Gibbons wept as she testified that she never wanted to insult Islam. She had allowed her six and seven year old pupils to vote on the name for a teddy bear that was part of a class project. The children had voted by 20 votes to 3 to name the bear Muhammad.\nAt the end of a seven-hour trial, the court found her guilty of \"insulting the faith of Muslims\". The Judge, Mohammed Youssef, rejected prosecution calls for a harsher sentence on the charge of \"inciting religious hatred\", which carries a punishment of up to 40 lashes, six months in prison and a fine.\nAfter the trial, Ms Gibbons was taken to the crowded women's prison in Omdurman to begin the remaining 11 days of her sentence. Although the prison is more comfortable than many in Sudan, conditions are not good, and Ms Gibbons will have to rely on wellwishers to supply her with food and water. \nAn appeal against the sentence is expected.\nReactions in Sudan.\nThe Assembly of the Ulemas, a body of Islamic clerics, said on Wednesday that Ms Gibbon's action was \"another ring in the circles of plotting against Islam\", and called for the harshest penalties to be applied. After Ms Gibbons was charged, a pickup truck drove through the Sudanese capital calling for protests against the alleged insult.\nSome members of Ms Gibbons' defense team reported receiving death threats.\nThe authorities quickly scheduled the trial, and issued instructions to clerics not to deliver inflammatory sermons at Friday prayers about the case or against foreigners.\nMajor General Abdeen al-Tahir of the Khartoum police stated that protests would not be permitted.\nAfter the trial, Ms Gibbons' chief lawyer described the verdict as \"not bad\", and her colleagues expressed relief that the sentence was not harsher.\nThe lawyer stated that the complaint was an act of revenge. Isam Abu Hasabu, director of the school's Parent-Teacher Association, claimed Khawad had been arguing with the principal before the incident. \nThe school, which according to press reports has issued a public apology and sacked Ms Gibbons, has been closed for security reasons since her arrest. The director said he was happy with the verdict: \"It is fair. There were a lot of political pressures and \u00adattention.\"\nOmar El Faroug Hassan Shumena, a legal consultant in Khartoum, said that he believed the judge had concluded the trial in a single day to reduce the chance of disorder after Friday Prayers.\nInternational reaction.\nCatherine Wolthuizen, chief executive of Fair Trials International, said Mrs Gibbons' punishment was still \"harsh\". She said: \"It was a very speedy justice process.\nAfter Ms Gibbons was charged, the Muslim Council of Britain (MCB) stated that they were appalled at the decision and called on the Sudanese President, Omar al-Bashir, to intervene to secure Ms Gibbons' release.\nAfter the sentence, they further stated:\nIbrahim Mogra, also of the MCB, stated: \"I'm utterly disappointed with this decision... The question that I would want the judiciary there and the authorities to ponder over is: How does this help the cause of Islam? What kind of message and image are we portraying about our religion and our culture?\"\nMike Blakemore of Amnesty International said: \"The sentence is a mockery of justice and Amnesty International consider Gillian to be a prisoner of conscience. She should be immediately and unconditionally released.\"\nDr Rowan Williams, Archbishop of Canterbury, said: \"I can't see any justification for this at all. I think that this is an absurdly disproportionate response to what is at best a minor cultural faux pas. And I think that it's done the Sudanese government no credit whatever.\"\nAccording to the BBC, the press in Sudan and the Middle East have largely ignored the case, but bloggers from Sudan have heaped scorn on the Sudanese authorities."}

According to the son of the hostage taker, he talked to a witness and said his father had been drinking last night and strapped road flares to his chest and said he was going to talk to Senator Clinton.\nWMUR cameras captured on live TV an armored car pulling up in front of the office and shortly after Leeland was seen walking out of the building, dropped something on the ground and surrendered to police. It is said that Leeland believed the U.S. government \"is coming after him\" and that there was a conspiracy to have him caught. Leeland has been taken to the local police station in Rochester.\nAfter the scene was evacuated of all hostages and the suspect, police used a robot to examine the reported device or bomb that Leeland was said to have.\nAccording to the DNC chairman Howard Dean, Senator Clinton has cancelled a speech at a Democratic National Committee meeting in Vienna, Virginia and all other events today to deal with the situation. Her husband, former US President Bill Clinton canceled a speech in New York City. Senators Barack Obama and John Edwards also have campaign offices down the street which have been closed and locked down along with the rest of downtown Rochester. Clinton's campaign offices located in Des Moines, Iowa have also been closed on a temporary basis.\n\"Unfortunately as some of you know, there is a hostage situation in New Hampshire involving a Clinton campaign staff person. The details are sketchy at this time, but understandably Sen. Clinton is now dealing with this very difficult problem and she is not going to be able to join us today. And we will keep them in our prayers and hope for a resolution to this situation in New Hampshire,\" said Dean at a press conference.\nThe incident began at around 1:00 p.m. (eastern time)."}

This lecture is described as the spark that ignited her interest in aviation.\nAt age 21, Beinhorn had a little money from an inheritance and against the wishes of her parents moved to Spandau in Berlin and learnt to fly at Berlin-Staaken airport under the tutelage of instructor Otto Thomsen. She had soon learnt to fly solo in a small Klemm KL-20, but her money was running out, so it was suggested she give aerobatic displays at weekends; financially rewarding, but personally unsatisfying.\nAfter World War II, Beinhorn briefly took up gliding due to the ban on powered flight in Germany.

The pipeline carries oil from Saskatchewan, Canada to close to Chicago, United States, representing 16% of America's total oil imports.\nThe section of the pipe that exploded was undergoing maintenance at the time to address a pinhole leak first identified three weeks earlier, and patched at the time with a metal sleeve. On Wednesday, the entire section was removed and replaced with a new one. When oil was reintroduced on Thursday morning, oil leaked where the new section joined the pre-existing pipe, triggering the fatal explosion.\nThe fire was extinguished later the same day.\nThe line is split between four separate pipes. After the explosion, all four pipes were shut down, resulting in the global price surge, but this subsided for the most part after it became clear that the three undamaged pipelines had returned to normal operation, restoring 80% of the line's capacity, and that the accident pipe is expected to be back in use in a matter of days.\n\"There were no problems found in that area where the leak occurred,\" reporters were told by Larry Springer, spokesman for Enbridge, the Canadian company that owns the line. High-tech equipment had been through the line in 2006 to check for any signs of problems.\nEnbridge identified the deceased as Dave Mussati Jr. and Steve Arnovich, both of whom were contract workers based in Superior, Wisconsin. The damaged section of pipe is in Clearbrook, which is approximately 350 miles Northwest of Minneapolis.\nEnbridge metallurgists have been sent to examine the failed section in an effort to determin the cause of the accident. Other Enbridge workers are working to clear spilled oil from the site. It is expected that once this is complete, the pipe will return to service. \nGlobal crude oil prices temporarily spiked by over US$4 per barrel but closed yesterday slightly above original prices.\nSources.\n "}

They were then assaulted by two men who fired on them. Agent Raul Centeno Pall\u00f3n died on the scene instantly, while Fernando Trapero Bl\u00e1zquez was injured seriously and is in a coma.\nThe civil guard were taking part in a joint surveillance operation with French police against ETA in southern France, when the two guardsmen were apparently detected and identified by the suspected ETA members. After the attack, the two suspected ETA members, and a woman who was with them, fled in a car. Having traveled about 70 kilometers, the two men abandoned the vehicle and robbed another car. The driver of the hijacked car was kidnapped, put in the trunk and finally left tied to a tree.\nThis is the first fatality blamed on ETA since it ended the last cease-fire in June, although it has carried out many non-fatal actions.\nThis incident comes a day after the National High Court of Spain issued arrest warrants to round up 46 of 52 Basque citizens prosecuted and sentenced previously on accusations of supporting ETA's separatist ideas."}

The announcement caused an impassioned discussion about the civil rights leader's work, the problems facing the community and whether Sharpton helps or hurts his cause. Opinion was divided. \"He's an opportunist.\" \"He only stirs things up.\" \"Why do I always see his face when there's a problem?\" \nShankbone went to the 's headquarters in Harlem with this Thanksgiving discussion to inform the conversation. Below is his interview with Al Sharpton on everything from , his purported feud with Barack Obama, criticism by influential African Americans such as , his experience running for President, to how he never expected he would see fifty (he is now 53). \"People would say to me, 'Now that I hear you, even if I disagree with you I don\u2019t think you\u2019re as bad as I thought,'\" said Sharpton. \"I would say, 'Let me ask you a question: what was \"bad as you thought\"?' And they couldn\u2019t say. They don\u2019t know why they think you\u2019re bad, they just know you\u2019re supposed to be bad because the right wing tells them you\u2019re bad.\" \nSharpton's beginnings in the movement.\nDavid Shankbone: You grew up around so many great American musicians and singers like and . \nDS: What was that like touring with Mahalia Jackson?\nDS: Did you keep in touch with her throughout her life? Did she have a presence in yours?\nDS: Ralph Abernathy?\nJames Brown: a father to Sharpton.\nDS: Are you still close to Reverend Jackson?\nDS: How did James Brown\u2019s death affect you?\nDS: He was such an icon, but then to also have had this deeply personal relationship must have had an extraordinary impact on you.\nDS: What was one lesson that he taught you?\nDS: There is so much anger at injustice, and that anger can fell a person\u2019s ability to right wrongs, or can steer them down a bad path. You have been able to take your anger and use it productively. When you come across a young person who is angry at the world around them, what kind of advice do you give them?\nDS: What would you do?\nDS: Which you see today. Dennis Kucinich or Tom Tancredo, they\u2019re not there because they think they are going to win; they are trying to frame the issues.\nCriticism: Sharpton is always there.\nDS: A lot of the criticism that is lodged at you is that you always seem to pop up around hot button issues, or where there is some race issue. My interview with you came up during my Thanksgiving dinner with my family, and I\u2019d like that dinner to inform our discussion because it illustrated many of the typical perspectives about you. My brother-in-law made that point, that there you always are around the controversial race issue. I responded with, \u201cWell, what was he saying? Was he wrong about what he said? Why do we focus on Sharpton and not the issue he is talking about?\u201d\nDS: Nadine Strossen, the President of the ACLU, brought up in our interview that their critics intentionally distort their work to serve their own purposes. For instance, many people believe the ACLU works to keep religion out of the school, yet they have consistently fought for the right for religion to be in schools. She debated Falwell and Robertson on these issues, and they will still say that the ACLU is fighting to remove God from the public sphere.\nDS: When you come across people who intentionally misinform the debate in order to scuttle your goals, what do you do?\nDS: That\u2019s the same response Ingrid Newkirk gave in an interview when I told her people say she cares more about fighting for animals than for humans. She responded that\u2019s what PETA does: give a voice to those who do not have one. She said that criticism is like telling a homeless shelter they care more about the homeless than people who live in mansions. \nTawana Brawley to Megan Williams.\nDS: Are you tired of hearing always paired with your name?\nDS: How would 2007 Al Sharpton have handled the Tawana Brawley case differently than 1987 Al Sharpton?\nDS: You are saying that when you become involved you are fighting to ensure that there is a fair investigation into whatever has happened, and that sometimes you are paired with the fact that not everything turns out in favor of the person being investigated?\nSharpton and the African-American media.\nDS: recently wrote a relatively laudatory column about you in '. In it he said, \"When Sharpton toppled Jesse Jackson from the top spot as black America's main man, the notoriety, and the hostility, that that title carries with it, insured that he'd take the heat for whatever went right or wrong when blacks took to the streets in protest.\" What do you think happened to Jesse Jackson\u2019s place in the black community? Hutchison is a prominent black man saying you toppled Jackson. \n\"'DS: Clarence Page again in reference to this wrote, \"\" culture punishes those who don't ',' to quote a popular inner-city T-shirt slogan, even when the victims are innocent neighbors. A lot of us black Americans would like to take back our streets. We could use a little more help from our leaders.\" \nDS: You are saying that black columnists, whether it be Clarence Page or Juan Williams, who seem to have made their names by attacking a lot of the work done at the grass roots. How can you change that?\nDS: Such as Juan Williams?\nWhy the need for an Al Sharpton?\n\"'DS: At Thanksgiving we were talking about the different voices for different communities, and I said that there is no \"Al Sharpton\"\u2014the Cubans used to have , but nobody has taken his place\u2014nor is there an Asian \"Al Sharpton\". With the black community it seems like Americans are always looking for \"the\" voice. Do you think that your visibility has been externally imposed?\nDS: But there\u2019s no one voice. It seems like the others never have a singular voice. \nDS: Shane Johnson is an African-American blogger who was protesting your Washington, D.C. Department of Justice march. , who is one of your critics within the African-American community, wrote a column about it. He wrote, \"Why do we black folks get so much more agitated about occasional white-on-black insults than about the black-on-black assaults that constantly terrorize certain neighborhoods?\"\nDS: Is getting your message out that you do more than just race-based issues a challenge you have difficulty overcoming? That\u2019s all that people hear and see you do.\nAl Sharpton and Presidential Politics.\nDS: Recently a poll came out that showed sixty-one percent of the black Americans surveyed said values between poor and middle-class blacks are moving too far apart to be viewed as a common black experience. Only 41 percent expressed that view in a similar 1986 poll. Do you think the black experience is no longer defined by race, but by socio-economic status?\nDS: What did you learn about national politics from your Presidential run?\nDS: Is there one moment that sticks out in your mind?\nDS: The way it\u2019s presented in the media.\nDS: It seems the media\u2014both liberal and conservative\u2014has to follow a narrative.\nDS: Was there a moment that sticks out in your mind during the campaign with anyone in particular?\nDS: What about during the debates?\nOn Barack Obama.\nDS: Who are you supporting for President?\nDS: The Post reported back in April that you have a conflict with Obama. What do you think is behind that story?\nDS: Why do you think Obama is not dominating the black vote?\nThe Iraq War.\nDS: Do you think there should be ?\nDS: Do you consider our military a volunteer army?\nDS: Which you saw in Vietnam, and many national leaders now found ways not to go.\nDS: How has the war affected you?\nDS: Are you optimistic for the future?\nSharpton as a symbol.\nDS: I interviewed , who is one of the leading voices in the fat acceptance movement. She is what she calls a \u201cBBW\u201d. A . Your name came up in that interview and she called you \"Reverend \" and mentioned that fat people don\u2019t have their own \"Al Sharpton\", someone they can turn to when they are being hassled at work because they are a drain on their insurance, or when fat people are discriminated against or harassed. When you hear that you have become a symbol that transcends your community, what do you think?\nDS: When you were ten, when you were preaching\u2014\nDS: It\u2019s interesting that you have become that to other people.\nDS: Do you think the criticism is more because you are successful for bringing attention to it? \nDS: Why do you think that happens?\nDS: Did you ever do a test to see if you were related to ?\nDS: Do you keep in contact with ?\nDS: Did you ever think you\u2019d reach fifty?\nDS: Who are some up-and-coming civil rights leaders under thirty?\n\"'DS: At Thanksgiving my brother-in-law\u2019s brother made the point that we in white America don\u2019t remember history, and that when we come across people who \"do\" remember history and we are always shocked. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you get over it and move on?\u201d But that doesn\u2019t take into account that there is a long history of racial problems that have set people behind in the race by half a mile, and suddenly it\u2019s supposed to be, \u201cYou\u2019re equal, it\u2019s a fair race now.\u201d\nDS: One sees this problem with history with the in the right wing. They have an entirely different perspective on history. They don\u2019t view and \u2014who were secular\u2014as our founding fathers. When they talk about America\u2019s founding fathers they mean and the . \n\"'DS: Then the focus is on gangsta culture and instead of looking at how that came about, it is talked about as if it is a phenomenon that just \"happened\"?\nBlacks and whites and talking about race.\nDS: At the end of the Thanksgiving discussion, I said that if a black person was sitting at the table with us, we would never have had the entire conversation. We talked about that. Do you think there is a nervousness amongst the races to engage each other?\nDS: I think it was who used to talk about the problem is the races too afraid to talk to each other about race. \nDS: Would you say what sums up the problem with dialogue as you see it is that white people are too afraid to offend black people by asking questions about their perceptions, but that black people become too offended by white people\u2019s ignorance?\n, and.\nDS: When you think about Imus, Michael Richards and Duane Chapman, it\u2019s starting to seem almost like a rehearsed play. They have these racist explosions, and then they come to you seeking absolution. How do you feel about playing this?\nDS: One of the issues that came up in reference to that at Thanksgiving was . My brother-in-law brought up the and said it was political correctness. His brother said that there is a big difference between calling black girls playing basketball versus asking a black person why their families are in trouble.\nDS: But those get equated as being politically incorrect. \nDS: Are you okay that Don Imus is going back on the air?\nDS: Do you work with the Hip Hop Action Network?\nDS: How did they disagree with you?\nDS: If you could choose how you die, how would it be?\nDS: What do you think is the greatest threat to humanity?\nDS: Global warming?\nDS: Are there any national politicians you look up to as leaders?\nDS: Do you think has done a good job with ?

The theme selected by the World AIDS Campaign is \"Stop AIDS: Keep the Promise\" as it will be through 2010. The day was marked by thousands of events around the world.\n\"It is now time for bold leadership at all levels in order to turn the tide of HIV,\" said Felicita Hikuam, Global Programmes Manager, World AIDS Campaign. An estimated 33.2 million people around the world\u2014one in every 200\u2014are living with HIV, and approximately 6,800 people are infected with HIV and 5,700 people die of AIDS-related illnesses every day.\n\"The trend is encouraging but still for every person receiving treatment four others are newly infected,\" said Nelson Mandela, speaking at a concert in Johannesburg, South Africa. \"If we are to stop the Aids epidemic from expanding, we need to break the cycle of new HIV infections. All of us working together with government, communities and civil society can make the difference that is needed,\" he continued.\nAs many as 50,000 people attended the concert in Johannesburg, South Africa, which was telecast around the world. It was organized by Nelson Mandela's 46664 AIDS campaign and featured performances by artists such as Peter Gabriel, Ludacris, Razorlight, the Goo Goo Dolls and Annie Lennox.\nAt a fundraiser in the town of Midrand, in the province Gauteng, near Johannesburg on Friday, singer Annie Lennox had strong words for the South African government's AIDS policies.\n\"AIDS, as Madiba [Mandela] has said, is a human rights issue and should be treated as such in order to avoid this genocide that is affecting millions and millions of people around the world,\" said Lennox in a speech. Lennox has previously been critical of the South African government's position on suggesting some AIDS medications were toxic. \"It is unacceptable that treatment has not been made available to those who need it most,\" said Lennox.\nThe rock band Queen, which lost its lead singer Freddie Mercury to AIDS, released a new song entitled, \"Say It's Not True\", to coincide with World Aids Day. It has been made available as a free download from the band's website. \"By making the song available for free, we hope to help Nelson Mandela with his campaign to get across the message that no-one is safe from infection,\" said Queen drummer Roger Taylor. \"We have to be aware, we have to protect ourselves and those we love.\"\nIn China, people distributed AIDS prevention brochures in the streets and promoted safe sex in cities like Beijing and Shanghai. In Changsha, official warning signs were put on hotel bedstands. The government announced on Friday an allocation of CNY860 million for AIDS prevention and control. According to official reports, there are estimated to be 700,000 people living with HIV/AIDS in China.\nAlso in China, the Miss World 2007 was in Sanya on World AIDS Day. The pageant presented a special tribute to the fight against AIDS, with a televised speech from former South African President Nelson Mandela, along with traditional dancers from South Africa who joined the contestants in a special song.\nFriday, United States President George W. Bush urged the United States Congress to double the 2003 Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief to US$30 billion over the next five years. \"Above all, we rededicate ourselves to a great purpose: We will turn the tide against HIV/AIDS\u2014once and for all,\" he said.\n\"I'm pleased to announce that Laura and I will travel to sub-Sahara Africa early next year,\" Bush said. Sub-Saharan Africa suffered nearly three-quarters of AIDS-related deaths during 2006 and is home to two-thirds of those living with HIV/AIDS."}

Amongst some of the higher-priced items were a carved walnut Victorian-style custom built pool table which raised $11,250, a painting from Edourad Drouot which fetched $10,500, a pair of Ozzy's famous round glasses which raised $5,250 and a dog bed given to Sharon by Elton John which sold for $2,375.\nSome more famous items were also amongst the 500 lots offered. Ozzy's black satin coat, complete with bat-wing cape, raised $3,300 and a hand-painted floral cup used regularly on \"The Osbournes\" made $1,625. A bronze plaque of a demon's head that was regularly seen in its position adorning the front door of their house had been expected to go for $800 to $1,200instead raised $8,750. A wire model of the Eiffel Tower from on the kitchen table sold for $10,000, while skull-covered trainers Ozzy had worn reached $2,625. Bidders came from as far away as Germany to buy what they could from his mansion in Beverly Hills, California.\nHowever, three cars included in the auction failed to attract bidders and did not sell. They were a 2006 Bentley Continental Flying Spur, estimated at $160,000 to $180,000, a 2005 Cadillac CTS-V sedan estimated at $30,000 to $40,000 and a 1950 Oldsmobile Futuramic 88 Club Coupe previously owned by author Danielle Steel estimated at $40,000 to $50,000.

Second, she turns that confidence into drive. She has been receiving steady work as a model since leaving the show, and still believes that her goal of being the first woman to wear a size ten dress on the cover of \"Vogue\" is in reach. Third, and probably most important to television viewers, she obliterates the age-old model stereotype that to be pretty and photograph well, one must also be vapid and without a thought. A graduate of Dartmouth College, Cunningham also dreams of becoming a writer, and is working toward dual goals: a model who can express herself like no other model before her.\nCunningham recently sat down with Wikinews reporter in an impassioned interview, taking hours to field questions from the reporter as well as from fans of \"America's Next Top Model\". Always in high spirits, Cunningham shows that she is a distinct personality who has carved her own niche in the \"Top Model\" history books. At the same time, she exhibits a \"joie de vivre\" that is oddly reminiscent of earlier \"Top Model\" fan favorite Toccara Jones, who showed America just how to be \"big, black, beautiful and loving it.\" However, Cunningham is quick to remind everyone that she isn't big at all; she is simply a regular woman.\nThis is the first in a series of interviews with \"America's Next Top Model\" contestants. Interviews will be published sporadically.\nWhitney's beginnings, and looking back.\nMike Halterman: So, who were the people you looked up to and inspired you to pursue modeling?\nMH: Did you follow \"America's Next Top Model\" before appearing on the show, and if so, who did you like?\nMH: If you could quickly summarize your experience on the show, how would you describe it?\nMH: What do your friends and family think of your stint on reality TV?\nMH: What were some of your specific pros and cons as a result of entering this contest?\nImpact \"Top Model\" has on society.\nMH: Do you ever fear what negative effect the show will have on girls? \nMH: Do you think that in some way the show can lead to girls developing an obsession with how they look, their weight, etc?\nMH: Did Tyra encourage a certain standard among the girls (weight or otherwise) that was unhealthy?\nMH: Do you think Tyra still believes her show is about finding \"the next top model\" even though none of the show's winners have had that success?\nMH: A fan wrote in to ask, \"What struggles did you face on the show as a plus sized model?\"\nMH: Do you think it was unfair for Tyra to ask that [studying magazines and developing your poses] of you and Diana, considering that even though she's fuller-figured now, she has a lot more experience under her belt than you two did?\nMH: It sounds like you're doing just fine for yourself. Which one fan also asked, \"Have you faced adversity about your weight since being on the show?\"\nMH: Another fan writes: Do you feel like \"plus size\" models are treated fairly? (I put \"plus size\" in quotes because I don't believe you are \"plus size\"!)\nWhitney's views on production and editing.\nMH: Do you believe the producers for shows such as \"Top Model\" intentionally pick people who are perhaps unstable, for better television?\nMH: Can you explain what types of things the producers allow you to say or not say following your departure from the show?\nMH: Who selects your best photo for each panel and do you think there are ulterior motives involved?\nMH: How did they decide who was going to read the Tyra Mail for the episode? Was it random, planned, or was it really who 'discovered' the note each morning?\nMH: Were you forced to fake your excitement over Tyra Mail?\nWhitney takes more fan questions.\nMH: Do you still keep in touch with girls from your cycle? If so, who?\nMH: What were the pressures like in the house?\nMH: Is it common for agencies or clients to contact you after seeing the show? \nMH: And do you get contacted from the guest designers that appeared on your cycle?\nMH: A fan really wanted to know, \"Was Dionne as funny as she was on the show?\"\nMH: How did you feel when Dionne and Renee only got T-shirts as a prize for winning the acting challenge?\nMH: There were a lot of negative reactions from fans when Jaslene won. Do you think she was the best choice? If so, why? If not, who would have been the better choice and why?\nMH: Some negative fan reactions were \"How could Jaslene sell a product when she can't speak English well?\" and \"Model? She's not even pretty! She looks like a man!\" Which, I wish I was making it up, but it's a rather loud fan voice on those points. What do you say to them about that? And following on that, do you think fans can be excessively cruel toward the contestants?\nMH: You and Diana were some of the only models in this cycle who were working toward a college degree. Did you feel that you were smarter than the other girls? Did people at your college watch Top Model to see you and root for you?\nWhere Whitney is today.\nMH: And on that note, a fan wanted to know if you finished your degree at Dartmouth.\nMH: This past May, right?\nMH: Do you plan on moving back to Florida, or are you going to continue living in New York City?\nMH: Apart from your spread in Plus Model Magazine, what else are you doing now?\nMH: What is your message to the girls of America who have big dreams of their own? What would you tell them?"}

In founding this demand, they each drew on the IPCC's Fourth Assessment Report, which establishes that the window for mitigating dangerous climate change closes in year 2030.\nThe outgoing President of the last session, David Mwiraria, Kenyan minister for environment and natural recources, held the first speech making some statements on his term of office. He went on to remind that the least developed, many of which are African nations and the small island states, are the ones that will be hit hardest by global warming, now and in the future.\nThe new president of the conference, Mr Witoelar, Indonesian minister of the environment agreed with that statement, saying that the \"most severe impacts [...] will be felt by poor nations, and the poorest within them\" and drew the conclusion that it is \"critical that we act, and act now.\" Looking at the chances for the so-called \"Bali roadmap\" being agreed on, he noted that from consultations he had \"heard that there was widespread support from governments\" for making this happen. He went on to say that \"Many have also expressed support for a target date of 2009\". \nAs the two speakers before him, Yvo de Boer of the UNFCCC noted that 2007 had been a exceptional year regarding climate change, with multiple political high level meetings being held. He went on to say that the delegates should reach agreement on a multitude of issues that had only been in discussion up until now. Amongst others, these included the organizational questions regarding the Adaptation Fund, which is aimed at funding measures that will increase the adaptive capacity of nations with developing industries. Reaching agreement on these issues would allow their substance to be implemented, and at the same time \"free up the negotiation capacity needed for the post-2012 process\".\nFinally, he addressed the matter of whether the targets that are to be set by 2009 are to be internationally legally binding or not, an issue that the United States is particularly sensitive about. He stated that in his opinion form follows function, making an allegory to the targets needing to be set before agreement being reached on how they are to be mandated ."}

John Connor, chief executive of the Climate Institute, says Australia could cut its emissions by 20 percent by 2020.\n\"What this concludes is that we can actually have a strong leadership position with barely a ripple on economic growth. We'd still see a tripling of the economy through to 2050 and strong employment and quality of life growth,\" Connor said.\nMr. Rudd's decision to sign the Kyoto climate accord isolates the United States, which will now be the only developed nation not to ratify the agreement. Australia's former conservative government refused to ratify Kyoto, saying it would damage the economy with its heavy reliance on coal exports, while countries like India and China were not bound by emissions targets.\nMr. Rudd's cabinet creates a new portfolio of Minister for Climate Change and Water, held by Penny Wong, an ethnic Chinese immigrant from Malaysia. She is one of seven women in cabinet, including deputy Prime Minister Julia Gillard. Former rock singer Peter Garrett was sworn in as Environment Minister. Responsibility for running a strong Australian economy now falls to Treasurer Wayne Swan, one of Prime Minister Rudd's most trusted lieutenants. The recently appointed foreign minister Stephen Smith, a lawyer from Western Australia, is expected to visit the United States early next year to discuss Australia's plans to pull its troops out of Iraq.\nMr. Rudd's decision to sign the Kyoto Protocol clears the way for his government to play a stronger role when he leads a delegation of four Australian ministers to the U.N. climate talks in Bali.\nThey began Monday and will search for a new carbon emissions scheme to be introduced when the Kyoto treaty expires in 2012. \nSources.\n "}
