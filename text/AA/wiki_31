When children have AD36 antibodies, that means they had the virus at some point in their life. AD36 causes colds and eye infections. \nComparing the obese children who had the antibodies versus the obese children who didn't have the antibodies, the kids with the antibodies were significantly more obese, at 35 pounds heavier.\n\u201cThis shows that body weight regulation and the development of obesity are very complicated issues,\" Dr. Jeffrey Schwimmer, the study's lead author, said. Schwimmer also said that \"[i]t's not simply a case that some children eat too much and others don't. There are children who eat all the wrong things in all the wrong quantities who are not obese.\"\nSchwimmer said that he's not blaming the US childhood obesity epidemic on the virus, but noted that \"I\u2019ve seen children who had very brisk weight gain in a given year for reasons that were very hard to pinpoint. These may be the children who have obesity related to this infection.\" \nThe study is backed up by past reports that show the virus boosts production of fat cells. In studies in which animals were infected with AD36, the animals gained a significant amount of weight.\nThere is currently no vaccine for AD36, and no routine screening for the virus. Dr. Goutham Rao, clinical director of the Weight Management and Wellness Center at Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh, said that \"People want a magic solution. Unfortunately, we don't have one. What people can do is focus on a child's behaviors and eliminate the unhealthy behaviors.\" Rao also said that \"Instead of coming to the doctor and requesting a test for the virus, parents would do better to discuss key behaviors to combat obesity.\"\nDr. James Cherry, specialist in pediatric infectious diseases at the David Geffen School of Medicine at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), was also interested by the study. He said that if the link between AD36 and obesity were confirmed, developing a vaccine for the virus could be worthwhile. \"More than 20 percent of the obese children in this study were positive for the antibody. If we could prevent 20 percent of all obesity, that would be pretty impressive,\" Cherry said."}

Migraine sufferers (thought in the United Kingdom to number about eight per cent of men and eighteen per cent of women) often complain that light, noise and touch cause pain. TRESK can potentially be affected by drugs that would change the point at which it reports pain, which would alleviate the suffering of those with migraines.

The merger announcement comes just days after United Airlines sealed a merger deal with Continental Airlines.\n\"The acquisition of AirTran represents a unique opportunity to grow Southwest Airlines' presence in key markets we don't yet serve and takes a significant step towards positioning us for future growth,\" Gary Kelly, CEO of Southwest, said after the merger was announced.\nThe Southwest-AirTran deal, which awaits antitrust regulatory approval, will gain Southwest a larger US network. By merging with AirTran, Southwest will also be a strong competitor in Eastern United States cities such as New York City, New York, Charlotte, North Carolina, , Georgia and Washington, D.C., cities that Southwest had previously not touched much. Southwest also will be going international for the first time, inheriting AirTran's Mexican and Caribbean routes. The newly merged company would keep Southwest's name and livery.\nSouthwest will be offering AirTran stockholders US$7.69 per share. That's 69% more than AirTran's Friday, September 24 closing price. However, AirTran stock shot up 62% to $7.36 on Monday, while Southwest's stock rose more modestly to US$14.01. Delta Air Lines stock declined by 2% on Monday, as Southwest will gain an AirTran hub at Atlanta, which is also Delta's primary hub.\nThe new airline would carry over 100 million passengers, creating the world's fourth largest airline. Last year, Southwest carried 101,338,000 passengers, while AirTran carried 23,998,000 fliers. Southwest will be 25% larger after the merger is completed.\nDebate over airfare hikes.\nThough some people worry that airfares will go up, as people worried about during the United-Continental merger, others, including Southwest, aren't too worried. \"America needs this now. You could go from Rochester, N.Y., to somewhere on AirTran, and from Charlotte to somewhere on AirTran. But with this deal you can now go just about anywhere in the country, and to the Caribbean and Mexico, on Southwest.. . With the more than 100 destinations that Southwest will now have, all the legacy airlines will have to set their prices based on whatever Southwest does,\" says Tom Parsons of BestFares.com. Parsons also said that \"I think America is going to very happy that now they can fly coast-to-coast between 100 U.S. cities and make the legacy airlines be more competitive with the style of Southwest and their low fees.\" \nConsumer advocate Clark Howard also weigned in with a positive remark on the deal. \"It's so good for the flying public. This is an opportunity for a discounter to have the kind of heft and national reach of the full-fare airlines,\" he said.\nSouthwest even has said that fares could go down, as the \"Southwest effect\", which is supposed to stimulate competition, \"has the potential to stimulate over two million new passengers and over US$200 million in consumer savings, annually\" in Atlanta, according to the company. After the merger, Southwest also plans to drop AirTran's checked baggage fees of US$20-25. Southwest currently does not charge for checked baggage. \nOthers aren't as thrilled with the merger of the low-cost airlines. \"This is truly a shocker, and it can only mean further consolidation. I don't think anyone really saw this coming. More than any recent merger, it spells bad news for low fares, since both airlines were leaders in the low fare space and had frequent, almost weekly, sales. I can only imagine that now pressure is on for American to find a partner, and also US Airways, and that will lead to even less fare competition.\" says George Hobica, of airfarewatchdog.com. Hobica also said that \"The era of irrational, stupid, destructive fare sales is over. This is the new normal. JetBlue now has permission to raise prices between Baltimore and Boston. Other airlines now have permission to raise prices between Washington, D.C., and Florida.\"\nThough Hobica was generally pessimistic about the deal, he did state that the Southwest takeover would be a win for AirTran customers, \"because Southwest has better service than AirTran and lower fees.\" "}

The planet, named \", is approximately 20 away from Earth and is hypothesised to have a generally rocky landscape with enough gravitational pull to accumulate an atmosphere.\nSteven Vogt of the University of California stated that Gliese 581g potentially has a gravitational pull similar to that of Earth, which would allow humans to walk around upright on its surface although human inhabitation of the planet is in no foreseeable future. Vogt observed that there is a significant possibility that life exists on Gliese 581 g.\n\"Personally, given the ubiquity and propensity of life to flourish wherever it can, I would say, my own personal feeling is that the chances of life on this planet are 100 per cent,\" Vogt said. Only lichen, bacteria and other micro-organisms are expected to exist on the planet.\nGliese 581 g is thought to have a temperature range from extremely hot to freezing cold depending on the side with respect to its star. The average temperature is expected to range from \u221231 to \u221212 degrees Celsius.\nPrior to this discovery, two other planets were discovered in the low or \"cold\" end and the high or \"hot\" end of the 'Habitable Zone', respectively, orbiting the same star."}

Clementi drove one hour along the New Jersey Turnpike, abandoning his car on the Jersey side.

Whitmore stated to \"LA Weekly\" that the alleged crime involved five hard drives each of $200 in value.\nMontalvo has been assisted by former members of Scientology, including musician Tiziano Lugli and actor . Rathbun requested donations via a statement made on his blog, in order to help Montalvo with his legal defense financing. He described Montalvo as an individual, \"facing the penitentiary in thanks for the following sins: a) Leaving a lifehood of slavery to get a taste of freedom and the world. b) Refusing - despite every provocation and incentive and threat - to frame three guys who went out of their ways (and dipped into their pockets) to help the kid achieve that freedom.\" "}

Beach not to intervene regarding appearance of an attorney in a case involving Scientology. Lawyer Kennan Dandar is representing the estate of Kyle Thomas Brennan in a wrongful death claim against the Scientology organization. \nThe suit asserts that members of the Scientology organization, including the father of Brennan, removed access to the deceased's anti-depression medication, and provided him with means to utilize a loaded gun. Brennan had been staying with his father for a week prior to his death. Police in , Florida investigated the 2007 death of Brennan, and determined it was a . Kyle Brennan was himself not a member of Scientology. The lawsuit, filed in 2009, was filed by Brennan's mother on behalf of her son's estate. Named as defendants in the lawsuit include the Scientology organization, its subdivision the Flag Service Organization, twin sister of Scientology leader \u2013 Denise Gentile, and her husband Gerald Gentile.\nAttorney Dandar had previously represented the estate of in a separate civil wrongful death claim against the Scientology organization. After being under the care of members of the Scientology organization for 17 days, McPherson died in Clearwater in 1995. The wrongful death suit claimed that Scientology officials permitted McPherson to deteriorate to a , where her condition was such that she did not have the energy to fend off from biting her skin. \nScientology management settled the McPherson wrongful death case in 2004; lawyers representing the organization stated the included a confidential arrangement with Dandar to never again represent clients in lawsuits against Scientology entities. The settlement included an agreement that both sides would never speak again about the case; California lawyer commented, \"The church bought silence.\" The Scientology organization had also filed a countersuit against the estate of Lisa McPherson, and named Dandar a party to that lawsuit. The organization claimed Dandar had inappropriately tried to add the head of Scientology as a party to the wrongful death lawsuit.\nScientology legal representatives requested Judge Beach to see to it that Dandar abide by the secret settlement agreement, and Beach subsequently issued an order in June 2009 that Dandar be removed from the Brennan wrongful death case. Dandar faced sanctions from Judge Beach including suspension of Dandar's license to practice law, a 130,000 judgement to be given to the Scientology organization, and a fine of $1,000 per day. Judge Beach ruled that all money from the sanctions imposed against Dandar \u2013 were to go directly to the Scientology organization. \"The Tampa Tribune\" noted that Judge Breach made his ruling, \"in an inexplicably closed hearing from which Beach tossed a St. Petersburg Times reporter\".\nFaced with these possible sanctions, Dandar filed an \"involuntary\" motion to withdraw from the Brennan wrongful death case in federal court, but Judge Merryday denied this request. Dandar stated to \"\", \"I'm stuck in the middle of two courts.\"\nD. Wallace Pope, a lawyer for the Scientology organization, stated that he wished to show evidence regarding the settlement in the McPherson wrongful death case. However, Judge Merryday emphasized his main issue was determining whether or not Dandar was being penalized for obeying the federal court's order denying his request to be withdrawn from the Brennan wrongful death case. Judge Merryday stated he would prevent the Scientology organization along with Judge Beach from punishing Dandar for representing his client in US federal court. Merryday stated Beach had attempted to usurp control outside of his jurisdiction, thereby \"aggressively\" interferring with the US federal court process through imposing sanctions on Dandar.\nMerryday has served as a US federal judge based in , Florida since 1992. The \"\" noted that Judge Merryday, \"has presided over some of the region's most noteworthy cases.\" Judge Merryday's court order creating an injunction against Beach was 29-pages long, and criticized the \"stunning severity\" of Beach's sanctions imposed on Dandar. Merryday explained that the federal court needed to \"act in defense of the (federal) court's jurisdiction\", due to Beach's actions. Referencing Judge Beach, Merryday wrote in his court order, \"A judge should not undertake, directly or indirectly, overtly or through a surrogate, to compel an act by another judge, especially in a different jurisdiction.\" \nJudge Merryday stated to Scientology lawyers, \"have forced my hand on this issue.\" Merryday stated to Scientology lawyer, Robert Potter, \"I don't like being put in this position. When people start to squeeze, other people can squeeze back.\" Potter asked him to seal the proceedings from public view, and Judge Merryday responded, \"I'm not going to be entering any seals unless I see a lawful reason, and I can't even see the beginning of a reason\". Merryday stated he would not allow his court to be influenced by \"some circuit judge somewhere who appears for all I can tell to have sealed something for some unknown reason\".\nJudge Beach responded to Judge Merryday's which \"permanently enjoined\" him from imposing sanctions on Dandar, by filing a motion on Thursday in federal court in Tampa. Beach asked Merryday to rescind his order so that he may himself from acting as a judge on the Scientology case related to Dandar. Beach's motion argued that he was denied due process because he was not given notice by Merryday of the hearing which occurred before Merryday issued his ruling. In addition, Beach asserted Merryday did not have power to issue the ruling restricting him from sanctioning Dandar, because Beach was not a party to the Brennan wrongful death case, and Merryday lacked authority to restrict powers of a judge from outside his federal court jurisdiction. In response, Judge Merryday has scheduled a hearing for October 12 in federal court to hear state court judge Beach.\nMartin Errorl Rice is an attorney in , Florida who represented Beach in the motion before the US federal court. Rice stated his client's motivation in requesting the ruling by Judge Merryday be rescinded was to allow Beach to recuse from the Scientology case. Rice told the \"St. Petersburg Times\" that his client's conflict with the US federal court has \"cast kind of a cloud\" over Beach's position in the Scientology case.\n professor Michael Allen analyzed the clash between the US judge and Florida judge for \"The Tampa Tribune\". Allen observed that it was \"very, very rare\" for a US federal judge to order a state judge. He noted that a contravenes such orders \u2013 except in \"extraordinarily narrow\" cases where the federal judges are permitted to create rulings in order to safeguard the jurisdiction of their federal court proceedings."}

Sources disagree on the number of witnesses\u2014between nine and eleven\u2014none of whom said they had seen the accused participate in any violence. Most of those questioned were Iraqi police.\nThe killings in Majar al-Kabir followed a dispute at the local market in which British soldiers had argued with Iraqis over the use of dogs to search, which the locals were upset about, according to policeman Ahmed Hassan Sayed. He said gunfire followed and the soldiers killed around ten people. \"I was inside the [police] station with the British soldiers. They had been coming twice a week for training...

I also told the British to leave.\"\nSayed went on to say in his testimony that the British soldiers had refused to leave as they felt they were in the clear since they were present for training only. The police left the station via a back window; the British remained in the courtyard while around 400 people attacked. \"What I understand is that this was an act of tribal vengeance.

He said that he heard I was a very nice person and that I should come into the church to do an introductory service myself. I remember becoming very curious about this. I recall thinking, \"Even though I\u2019m just a kid, these guys are interested in me!\" That somehow made me feel recognized and important.\nI told my mother about the invitation and asked if I could go in with her to meet Brett, to which she agreed. Brett was a very handsome man, posted as the Public Registrar, responsible for signing new people up for service and collecting their money. He interviewed me and said that he could tell I had a lot of potential and would go very far in life, but that I needed to learn several tools to be able to do so successfully. I really wanted to find out all about this. Brett called my mother into his office and had her pay for my first course so I could get started immediately. And so, I enrolled on my first course \u2013 the \"Communications Course\", on 17 May 1978.\n Do you still see positive benefits out of some aspects of Scientology methodology? How so? What courses, programs, do you consider beneficial?\nAS: There are some things that I consider to be basic truths, such as that one is a spiritual being, but that's not unique to Scientology. I honestly no longer consider the methodology to be beneficial since I have seen the results of its application in broken families and broken individuals. I do have many friends who still very much believe in the technology, but consider the organization has turned criminal. To me, people should be free to believe in what they'd like. It's when the practices begin to hurt people is where I object.\n Why did you decide to join the elite Scientology group, the ?\nAS: I thought that it sounded like an exciting adventure where I could help \"salvage the planet\" on a much larger scale than just in my home town. The \"Sea Organization\" (also Sea Org or SO for short) is defined on the official Church of Scientology web site as follows:\n\"The Sea Org was established in 1967 and once operated from a number of ships. It was set up to help L. Ron Hubbard with research of earlier civilizations and supervise Church organizations around the world. The first Sea Org members formulated a one-billion-year pledge to symbolize their commitment to the religion as immortal spiritual beings. It is signed by all members today. The Sea Organization is also entrusted to minister the advanced services of Scientology. The Sea Organization retains its name in celebration of the fact that Mr. Hubbard\u2019s life was frequently connected to the sea. Although today the majority of Sea Organization members are based on land, in keeping with the tradition of the order\u2019s inception, they still wear maritime-style uniforms and have ranks and ratings. Sea Org members work long hours and live communally with housing, meals, uniforms, medical and dental care provided by the Church. They participate in Scientology training and auditing during a portion of each day, but otherwise dedicate themselves to furthering the objectives of Scientology through their particular functions.\"\nIt was September, 1979. Word arrived that an expansion event was being held in the Seattle church for all local Scientologists by officers of the Sea Org. Attendance was mandatory. My mother and I went to the event together. As people arrived, we were all ushered in and seated in a large hall.\nBefore the event began, surveys were passed out for the audience to fill in, asking detailed questions about our individual qualifications, such as whether or not we had ever taken LSD, ever been institutionalized, if we had a criminal record, had huge personal debts and so forth. My answer to every one of these questions was, \"No\". The surveys were collected up and the event began.\nThe speaker came out and briefed us on the strategy to make Scientology a household word internationally and how it was vital for everyone to immediately get on the bandwagon to help make this a reality. He had a large map of the world behind him and pointed out the small red dots as current church locations, which appeared minuscule compared to the size of the planet. Then, in the middle of the event, the speaker read out a list of people who were to report immediately to a room in the back for a private briefing. My name was on the list. I felt my heart pounding as I couldn\u2019t figure out how they knew my name. I had forgotten all about filling out the survey prior to the event.\nMy mom\u2019s name wasn\u2019t on the list, so I had to go to the special briefing without her. I reported to the back, along with about twenty others from the audience. The main event speaker (named Don) came to the back room, along with three other people in full dress Sea Org uniform (navy caps, gold lanyards, white gloves, dirks tied around their waist \u2013 the works). He informed us that we were the select few who were qualified and that we were all to join the elite team of the Sea Org \u2013 right now!\nDon said that while he moved on to the next city to get many more people on board, two SO members were staying behind in Seattle to get all of us packed and sent off to the Sea Org. He handed out Sea Org contracts, had us all stand up, raise our right hands and repeat the code of a Sea Org member after him. This is called the \"swearing in ceremony\". We all then signed the contract, pledging to work full time for the next billion years.\nI had no clue what I was doing. I wondered why my mom\u2019s name wasn\u2019t called and what she would think. I didn\u2019t dare question the Sea Org Officers. Everyone was following orders and I thought I had better as well. I did ask what type of work we\u2019d be doing and the response was, \"Our mission is to get ethics in on this planet and the universe. You\u2019re joining the elite of the elite, responsible for handling the suppressive psychiatrists that exist in the here and now and those who implant beings between lives so as to make planetary clearing an actuality\". I was speechless.\nThe intermission was over, everyone was reseated and those in the back re-joined the rest of the audience for the remainder of the event. The speaker came back up and announced the names of those who had just joined the Sea Org. Immediate standing ovation! Loud cheers! We were going to be heroes!\nMy mom flipped out, \"No way\u2014don\u2019t they realize that you\u2019re still a minor? They have no parental consent. You\u2019re only in 9th grade and now you\u2019ll never get a proper education. How could they do this without discussing it with me first? It\u2019s out of the question!\"\nI went back to the recruiter and said I couldn\u2019t go as it wasn\u2019t coordinated with my mom.\nLike lions jumping on prey, the SO officers were all over my mom to handle her \"counter-intention towards Scientology expansion\".\nFinally, after being promised that I would absolutely continue my schooling to obtain a high school diploma, have three weeks off a year to come home to visit and be able to maintain routine communication with the family (all of which turned out to be a blatant lie), my mother signed a parental consent form, giving her approval for me to join the Sea Org \u2013 effective once I turned 16, which was only a few weeks away.\nThe recruiters had me list out things to handle before reporting for duty. My main concern was telling my dad, who knew nothing about Scientology. They said what I needed was a cover story, so tell him that I got a great offer and I\u2019ll be going away to become a model in Paris. My mother and I went to visit my dad and that\u2019s what we told him. He was so proud of me! I thought I was going to be sick.\nWithin a few weeks of signing my Sea Org contract, I was booked on a flight to Los Angeles. This was the first time I had been away from home and the first airplane I had ever been on. I arrived in Hollywood, California on 31 October 1979.\n Why did you choose to write a book about your experiences?\nAS: I felt it was very important to not only thoroughly review what I had just gone through for my 27 years as a staff member for Scientology, but to make that experience known to others so they can learn what goes on behind the scenes. The beginning services in Scientology seem very sensible and helpful. It's like the bait and once you nibble on it, they get a hook into you and it's NOT easy to free yourself once you're hooked. Making the information known will hopefully enlighten people so they can see just how controlling and demanding and abusive the organization is \u2013 and stay clear of it themselves.\n Can you explain your choice of the book's title - what it means and refers to?\nThe title of my book is SCIENTOLOGY \u2013 ABUSE AT THE TOP. At the lower echelons of the organization, the parishioners are \"schmoozed\" and treated with all kinds of smiles and compassion. That's because they pay for service and promote the \"religion\" to others so as to expand their ranks. So the organization needs to keep them happy and therefore the \"internal laundry\" of what goes on behind the scenes is kept entirely hidden away. The TOP of Scientology is the Sea Organization. My book describes the physical, mental/emotional abuse that occurs day-in and day-out in the Scientology's Sea Organization \u2013 from their Rehabilitation Project Force (which is nothing short of a slave-labor camp, to which I was assigned four times for several years), to the physical assault &amp; battery committed on the top executives by their current leader, David Miscavige (which I personally witnessed on at least a dozen occasions). Somehow the Scientology organizations are free from outside inspection because they are a \"religion\" and therefore allowed to practice their religious beliefs in any way they see fit. This is dangerous and the information about how far this has gone needs to be exposed, as it is extreme.\n You left Scientology in 2005, why did you decide to publish the book, five years later?\nAS: When I left in March 2005 after being a full-time, live-in staff member for a quarter century, I had a total of $150 to my name. I had no outside job skills, never cooked and I barely knew how to drive. I had no clue what I would be doing to make a living in the \"outside world\". It was not unlike being dropped on another planet and having to figure out how to survive from scratch.\nAfter I became stable and saved up some money, I began writing. As I wrote, I realized how important it was to get my story out. This \"religion\" promotes how their purpose is to create a sane world without criminality, etc. and the more I was OUT of their grip, the more I realized just how insane and criminal they really are. I learned about the Universal Declarations for Human Rights and saw how many points I personally knew were violated by the Scientology organization with their members. I learned about laws of the land (which I had been entirely ignorant of while a staff member) and realized some of the acts that I witnessed were actual violations of the LAW.\nBut what set me on the past to exposing the abuse within Scientology the most was when my mother was forced to disconnect from me, per Scientology's \"disconnection\" policy where members are to cut all ties with anyone not in good standing with their \"church\". This was a very emotionally traumatic situation. In my view, no religion worthy of the title should have a right to stand between loved ones.\n Quite early on in the book's first chapter, you recount an incident of being raped at age 14, by a 35-year-old married man who was your Scientology supervisor. You describe how your \"Scientology Ethics Officer\" found out, said you were in a \"state of treason\", and that the incident was kept quiet and not reported to the police by Scientology officials. How difficult was it to include this in the book? For what reason did you choose to include this? Why didn't you tell your parents about this?\nAS: To me, it was very important to include this information in my book because it gives the reader an idea of how Scientology operates. One of the worst crimes you can commit as a Scientologist is bringing about \"bad public relations\" for them. Things that happen internally are KEPT internal with the \"we handle our own\" doctrine. Unfortunately, this was a CRIME for which that person could have been arrested. Instead, it was \"handled\" by the local staff (swept under the carpet) and forgotten about. I didn't tell my parents because I was ashamed and afraid.\n After describing your arrival at the Scientology \"Flag Land Base\" in Florida at age 16, you recall how you met and became intimate with a 26-year-old man named David Paul, who later became your husband. For this act, you were subjected to a \"security check\" process on the Scientology device, the , and ordered to serve time performing manual labor on the controversial \"\" (RPF) of Scientology. Is 16 a relatively young age to be sentenced to the Rehabilitation Project Force in Scientology? Did you know other individuals on this program that were younger than you, or around the same age?\nAS: Yes, 16 is a young age to be sentenced to the Rehabilitation Project Force. I should have been attending school as per the agreement with my mother when she gave parental consent for me to join the Sea Organization \u2013 but I factually never saw one day of school after I joined. There were other teen-agers on the RPF at the same time, but I believe I was the youngest.\n During participation in the Rehabilitation Project Force, you recount how you were slapped across the face for refusing to climb into a garbage can after being ordered to do so by a leader of your group. How did this make you feel? Did you consider leaving the organization at all at this point in time? Why or why not, and why did you remain?\nAS: It was a completely nutty order and I wasn't about to comply. I ran around the block to get away as the lady who issued the order chased after me. I went to the person in charge asking for help but he was not in his office. The lady chased me into that office and then hit me across the face. I did NOT hit her back because I wanted to show that she was the crazy one. However when the Ethics Officer got there, he said I should have complied as she was my superior. I felt like it was a huge injustice because the order made no sense and had no purpose. She was just trying to exert her \"authority\" over me. But, I didn't want to be in more trouble, so I did my punishment for non-compliance and carried on. No, I did not think of leaving then. At that point, I just thought that lady was insane, not the entire organization.\n After completing your time on the Rehabilitation Project Force, you were appointed to the position of \"Commanding Officer of the Flag Land Base's Communicator\", where you were \"responsible for all in-coming and out-going traffic from the executive and obtaining compliance to all orders issued\". Did it surprise you that directly after finishing the Rehabilitation Project Force, you were given such a position of responsibility as a Scientology executive? Does this occur often in Scientology to members after they finish their sentence in the Rehabilitation Project Force?\nAS: In the Sea Organization, one is expected to be able to perform any duty \u2013 with or without training. It's preached that the salvation of the world is on our shoulders and everyone needs to pull up their bootstraps and make it go right. So, the appointment did not surprise me.\n Shortly after your promotion from Rehabilitation Project Force member to this position, you were promoted to \"Flag Land Bureau Estates Management Chief\", where you were \"responsible for all public hotels and services\", and subsequently promoted to the \" (CMO)\". At the end of chapter 3, you write how you were \"placed under a group justice action, called a Committee of Evidence\", and the committee, \"recommended my removal for neglect of duty regarding the schedule\". However, a few days later you were told you were assigned to Los Angeles, California, in order to recruit for members to join the CMO. Again, this appears to be a pattern of conflicting orders within the organization, where in one instance you were disciplined for perceived slights, and yet directly afterward, promoted to a higher position of authority as a Scientology executive. How do you explain this behavior within the organization?\nAS: The control and handling of personnel within the Sea Org was very unpredictable. There were always huge demands and needs for people on various projects or positions that had to be filled \"at once\". So one could expect rapid changes. It was also considered that after one messes up, they can be corrected using the \"ethics technology\" of Scientology and confessionals so they can carry on after their level of ethics are once again acceptable.\n What was the highest-ranking position you held within Scientology? Who did you report to in this position? What responsibilities did you have, and how many other people and sub-entities did you oversee?\nAS: I was in the Watchdog Committee (WDC) which is the highest ecclesiastical body in Scientology, with a WDC member appointed over each of the numerous \"sectors\" or areas of Scientology to see to their proper management. My boss as a WDC member is the WDC Chairman. This is the highest management position in the organization. I was in WDC for about a decade and held about six different sectors over the years, including the Association for Better Living and Education (ABLE) sector, which is responsible for the secular aspects of the organization \u2013 drug rehabilitation, criminal reform, Applied Scholastics study technology and The Way To Happiness Foundation \u2013 and the Celebrity Center sector. Anything that goes on inside your sector or sphere of responsibility as a WDC member, is your responsibility and you're held accountable. This could be very stressful, particularly when the current head of Scientology \u2013 David Miscavige \u2013 is so abusive. For example, Miscavige learned that the Tampa Scientology organization was not paying their rent in 2003. As I had previously been the WDC member for all Scientology churches (approx 175 of them around the world) and should have noticed and handled it then, Miscavige demanded that I personally pay the rent of $5,000 (which I did not have). This order was enforced by his personal staff \u2013 I had to borrow the money from several other staff members and turn it into the Finance Office, who then wrote a check to the Tampa organization to pay their back rent as a \"gift\" to them from management.\n In chapter 4 of \"Scientology - Abuse at the Top\", you cite the book ' by researcher , who explains that, \"Members are made to feel part of an elite corps of mankind.\" At what point in time did you read this book? Are there other books which helped you understand and put your experiences within Scientology into a greater context?\nAS: I read several quotes from Steven Hassan from the internet that made total sense to me, so I ordered his book. It's a fantastic read. I learned quite a lot about mind control and particularly found it interesting and true that a key aspect of mind control is INFORMATION CONTROL. If one can control the information that you are allowed to receive, then you can really control their thinking. They wouldn't be equipped with all of the ACTUAL information to be able to analyze and made a sane decision about something. In Scientology and especially in the Sea Organization, information is controlled intensively. This includes ALL communication via telephone or mail \u2013 incoming and outgoing \u2013 being screened through security personnel in order to detect any antagonism regarding Scientology from the \"outside\", no televisions allowed, no internet access, not being permitted to listen to or read any article that said anything negative about Scientology.\n\"News\" was obtained by the numerous Scientology events, covering the \"unprecedented expansion and world-wide acceptance of Scientology\". It was a lie, but it kept those not in-the-know thinking that we were doing well, so we need to keep working our guts out. It was astonishing to see when I left that Scientology had a BAD reputation of tearing apart families, of attacking critics, of scamming people out of their money, etc.\nI saw how Tom Cruise (supposedly the BEST Scientology disseminator in the world) was losing it on Oprah Winfrey's couch and with Mat Lauer. He was actually a laughing stock in the \"real world\". But to Scientology, per David Miscavige, Tom Cruise is the most dedicated Scientologist he knows and was responsible for booming Scientology around the world. Well, the statistics I saw while in management for two decades didn't have a Tom Cruise \"boom\" of expansion. In fact, we were constantly trying to find what was causing a lack of expansion in the various sectors of Scientology.\nSo, information control is a very important aspect of mind control to understand and watch for.\nAnother book I found to be very beneficial after leaving Scientology was \"\" by . It answered a lot for me.\n You described in chapter 6, being assigned to a sub-division of the Rehabilitation Project Force, called the \"RPF's RPF\". How was this different from the main RPF itself? What typical tasks were you ordered to perform? Were there many other women assigned to this unit? Were women given different roles or treated differently than men while on the RPF or the RPF's RPF?\nAS: The Rehabilitation Project Force (or RPF) is described by the church as a program offering a second chance to Sea Org members who have become unproductive or have strayed from the church's codes, involving intensive physical labor at church facilities and auditing and study sessions to address the individual's personal problems. I have a much harsher definition after spending a total of 5 \u00bd years on this program: A controlled slave labor camp to which is assigned anyone arbitrarily deemed a liability for actions (or thoughts) considered to be in opposition to the group.\nIf one gets in trouble while on the RPF program, they can be sent to the RPF\u2019s RPF, which is a mandatory two week sentence and could take longer. One is segregated from the rest of the RPF and suffers twice the penalties of a regular RPF member, works longer hours, gets no pay and experiences other such restrictions. Men and women are not treated differently \u2013 as a Scientologist, they think they are not their body but spiritual beings, able to endure anything. You are expected to be able to perform any duty, no matter the excuse. I did all sorts of degrading jobs as a member of the RPF's RPF, including hand shoveling a literal mountain of fermented and maggot-infested garbage for days. Several of these stories are included in my book so one can get the details of what really goes on to \"handle\" staff members in Scientology.\n During chapter 7, \"Scientology Celebrities\", you recount how you were ordered to eat \"rations of beans and rice for breakfast, lunch and dinner\", until you had filled a vacant WDC post. You write that you worked for two months in this capacity, attempting to fill the position and submitting 46 different recommendations. How did such a diet and living conditions affect you during this time? How was your overall health, well-being, and energy levels as compared to that when consuming a healthy full-balanced diet?\nAS: There is some writing from L. Ron Hubbard that rice and beans, eaten together, form a complete protein. So that was the justification of why it was okay to put people on such a meager diet as a form of punishment \u2013 they can't starve to death eating that. I learned to add things like mayonnaise to make it taste different and slide down easier. Looking back, I can't believe I went through with it \u2013 or 99% of everything else I endured, but you're in the frame of mind that any trouble can be overcome because one has to keep their eye on the overall big picture of helping to salvage the planet.\n While serving as executive over the Personnel Division at Commodore's Messenger Organization International, you write that you were given the task of \"a special project in LA to establish the Tom Cruise household with staff who were all Scientologists\". After interviewing individuals without telling them what they would be hired for, you note that \u2013 supervised directly by Shelly Miscavige, David Miscavige's wife and personal assistant \u2013 you narrowed down submissions which were then given to Tom Cruise's assistant, Andrea, to hire. Did these members of Scientology that were selected by Scientology management and then hired by Tom Cruise's assistant report back to the chain of command through David Miscavige, or to Tom Cruise, or both?\nAS: I did video recorded interviews with several Scientologists \u2013 they didn't know what the interviews were for. I told them that I was doing a project, had some questions and at some point may possibly get back to them. I asked them questions about themselves, their skills, where they stood on Scientology training and counseling, etc. I then weeded out the ones that I didn't think would be appropriate for the personal staff of Tom Cruise and for those who seemed promising, I compiled their video with contact information and sent it to Shelly Miscavige. She would forward to Andrea (TC's Assistant at the time) any she thought were good. Andrea would then contact them for an interview directly. This continued until they had Scientologists selected for all of the key functions of the Cruise household (chef, nanny, Executive Housekeeper, etc.). Up to that point, several of those functions had been being done by Sea Org members (the specifics on this are covered in my book). Once they were hired by TC, they reported to him or his Assistant for their work assignments, not to the Scientology organization to my knowledge.\n After being appointed in October 1991 as the \"Watchdog Committee member over the Celebrity Centre sector\", you recall meeting several members of \"the top Scientology celebrity public\", including John Travolta, , , , , , , , , Isaac Hayes, Tom Cruise, , and . In what capacity did you meet these Scientology celebrities? Were they coming in for Scientology auditing, or counseling? Did they receive advice and assistance in some form with their professional careers?\nAS: While I was working on the project to build Celebrity Centre International in Hollywood, I was often in the President's office of the Celebrity Center where the top celebrities often would come. That's how I met most of them. They would come into Celebrity Center to attend a course, to go in for a counseling session or to bring someone new in to introduce them to Scientology. Celebrity Centre International has a \"career counseling\" service it does provide and some celebrities have done this service to hopefully help them to do better in their careers.\n You write that you are aware of situations where members of Scientology hired by celebrities as assistants or security staff, have actually reported back to the organization through a Scientology process called \"Security Checks\", with revealing information about those celebrities. Did any of these celebrities ever find out such a tactic was being used to uncover information about them? If so, what was their response to this?\nAS: No, not to my knowledge.\n Shelly Miscavige told you that you were in the \"highest ethics condition attainable\" in Scientology while holding the executive position of \"Watchdog Committee Celebrity Centre\" (WDC CC), a condition called \"power\". How did it feel to attain this status within the Scientology executive leadership? Were you pleased, satisfied, or feel that the work you had done to date was worth it? Did you feel it was appropriate to serve time on the Rehabilitation Project Force, in order to later get to such a status?\nAS: Shelly Miscavige commented that I took the position to a condition of power \u2013 which is the highest condition of existence per the Scientology scriptures. But it was just a statement from her. No certificate or anything was issued.\nI was awarded PERMANENT POSTING STATUS on two executive positions in Church of Scientology International (CSI \u2013 the highest management organization for Scientology). This is a status that can only be verified and authorized by the Religious Technology Center (RTC \u2013 the holder of the Scientology trademarks and service marks). I received my Permanent Posting certificate by RTC as the Watchdog Committee member for Celebrity Centres (WDC CC), which I held as a single duty for four years, and as a function with other Scientology sectors for nearly a decade. Amongst the extensive list of requirements one must meet to become Permanently Posted, ones ethics and production record must be verified as excellent and you must be capable of generating on the order of a million dollars a year for the organization.\n In 1996, you were transferred to the executive post of Watchdog Committee member for the (WDC ABLE). ABLE is an organization operated by Scientology management which oversees groups that promote Scientology techniques. In this executive position, you were responsible for supervising Scientology-associated entities including: , , , and . Can you explain a little bit about the function and purpose of each of these groups? Are they actual-practice, separate \"secular\" functioning organizations, or somehow related to the Scientology organization itself? How specifically were these groups influenced and/or managed by Scientology leadership? How involved was David Miscavige in the functioning of these groups?\nAS: Association for Better Living and Education (ABLE): ABLE is an umbrella organization which specializes in promoting the use of Scientology technology as a means to solve social problems (drugs, crime, illiteracy and immorality) through Narconon, Criminon, Applied Scholastics and The Way to Happiness.\nNarconon: The Narconon program is a drug education and rehabilitation program, founded on Hubbard\u2019s belief that drugs and poisons stored in the body impede spiritual growth. Its \"purification program\" uses a regimen composed of sauna, physical exercise, vitamins and diet management, combined with auditing and study.\nCriminon: A program designed to rehabilitate criminal offenders by teaching them study and communication methods and helping them reform their lives.\nApplied Scholastics: Applied Scholastics promotes the use of Hubbard\u2019s educational methodology, known as study tech, originally developed to help Scientologists study course materials.\nThe Way to Happiness (TWTH) Foundation: The TWTH Foundation promotes a moral code booklet written by Hubbard, entitled The Way to Happiness.\nThese are secular organizations and they are definitely related to Scientology in that the entity that manages them are all members of Scientology's Sea Organization. When I was the Watchdog Committee member for the ABLE sector, one of my statistics was \"Reserves\" which was made up of the money collected from the tithes of each of these entities. David Miscavige appointed me to the WDC ABLE position and then issued a series of directions on what actions to be taken with the sector over the year that I held that job.\n After being told by David Miscavige that your husband at the time, Jim Mortland, was being removed or \"offloaded\" from Scientology's Sea Organization, you were called into the office of the Internal Executive where you were pressured into making a decision to stay in the Sea Org and separate from your husband. You write in the book, that your \"brainwashed response\" was to answer, \"I'm staying\". Why did you characterize this as a brainwashed response. How and why did you come to believe you had been a victim of ?\nAS: Per this Wikipedia definition, \"Mind control (also known as brainwashing, coercive persuasion, mind abuse, thought control, or thought reform) refers to a process in which a group or individual 'systematically uses unethically manipulative methods to persuade others to conform to the wishes of the manipulator(s), often to the detriment of the person being manipulated'.\" In my right mind, I would not have walked away from my husband of 17 years. In my right mind, I would not have \"turned a blind eye\" when I witnessed a dozen accounts of assault &amp; battery being committed on my comrades by David Miscavige. And I would never have given in to the physical labor and other \"ethics\" actions taken on myself and others for trumped up offenses. But I now understand that I was under the influence of mind control. This is not a light matter. People can laugh that concept off so readily, but it's a very REAL thing. When one considers what is at stake (or is thought to be at stake) if one were to step out of line or violate the rules in any way, you try to remain quiet and compliant. In Scientology, if you get yourself in enough trouble (from some executive's point of view), you can be banned from ever being allowed to receive the upper level services in Scientology \u2013 and thus enslave yourself as a spiritual being for eternity. Another more minor factor, but still major enough to keep you in line is the threat that any of your family or friends in Scientology would have to disconnect from you if you were no longer in good standing. So to say you want to leave, to go against the head of the organization, to report to outside authorities what's going on inside is considered more of a crime than being quiet and compliant as a \"good Scientologist\". This is what I consider has people brainwashed. It's a way to control their rational thinking. It's \"the end justifies the means\". When I realized that I had been rationalizing away utter insanities that I both witnessed and experienced in the organization and that I needed to simply look at what was factually in front of me, I started making my plans to leave. The details of this revelation and how I finally got out is all detailed in my book.\n In chapter 10, \"Assault and Battery\", you recount witnessing instances of violence by David Miscavige towards Scientology officials including: Ray Mithoff, Mike Rinder, and Jeff Hawkins. You write, \"I am ashamed that I did not have enough courage at the time to inform the authorities or call the police, which would have been the logical thing to do.\" Why do you think you decided not to report these instances to the police? What do you think law enforcement would have done if you had reported the matter to police? Knowing what you know now, and revisiting your memories of these incidents in hindsight, would you have acted differently if you were in the same situation again?\nAS: As I mentioned above, I learned at an early age that Scientology \"handles its own\" and that one of the biggest crimes you can commit is to bring about bad publicity for the organization as that is directly counter to the expansion plans of eradicating the reactive mind on the entire planet before it's \"too late\". At first, I justified the abuse \u2013 making excuses for why it could possibly be occurring. I thought, \"Miscavige is the head of the religion and he's having to handle so much that all the stress and non-compliance is putting him over the edge\". But when it kept occurring and kept occurring, I ran out of justifications. I could finally see that it was a pattern of an abusive sociopath. When I first started exposing the abuse after I left Scientology, several of the Scientology executives who I used to work with put together sworn affidavits claiming Miscavige never laid a hand on anyone. These were typed up and signed under the penalty of perjury. They know it's a blatant lie, but they think they're defending their religion by doing this.\nRegarding whether or not I would have done things differently were I in the same situation today \u2013 ABSOLUTLEY. I would have called the police. I would have filed criminal reports. I would have alerted the authorities that the head of the organization is hurting people in many ways and I would have gotten the agreement from my peers that Miscavige needed to come off any position of authority and has no right to lead in this fashion. I know that I would have been removed for Treason and declared a suppressive person for making that stand, but I'd be proud of the title because the one thing I would have left intact is my personal integrity.\n The last chapter of your book describes your emotional reunion with your family after leaving Scientology - first meeting your father and then calling and meeting your mother - and finally reuniting with Mark \"Mat\" Pesch, now your husband. At any point in time did you feel unsafe during your journey to reunite with these people? Did Scientology's intelligence agency, the (OSA), monitor you or your family after you left the organization?\nAS: As I was getting on the airplane home, the OSA staff member who escorted me to the airport said that I could not talk to my mother due to the \"suppressive person\" declare issue that she handed me a few hours before. Of course, after I arrived to my father's house, I realized that I was no longer under Scientology's control and I could contact my mother if I wanted \u2013 and I desperately wanted to! I hadn't seen her in years and now I was home for good! Scientology did find out about us seeing each other and took various actions to put pressure on my step-father to enforce their disconnection policy. This was very messy and is one of the key reasons I chose to speak out publicly against Scientology's human rights violations. At one point, my husband and I were followed by Private Investigators anywhere we went. We had to file a police report because one in particular was being very reckless in his attempts to stay on our tail \u2013 and flee when we tried to confront him. I finally filed a declaration against Scientology, showing several instances of harassment to myself and my family, which I considered witness tampering since I was named as a witness on an on-going lawsuit against them.\n Were you concerned that your relationships might be affected due to Scientology declaring you a \"\", and telling members of the organization never to speak to you again? Has this stopped you, or are you in communication with current and/or former members of the organization?\nAS: Aside from the incident mentioned above with my mother (which is now handled as she, too has left the church along with her husband), the \"Suppressive Person\" label has not stopped me from communicating to anyone I feel the need to communicate with. Some associates \"discovered\" (were told by Scientology when they saw them as my friend on facebook or something) that I was declared suppressive and therefore told me they could no longer talk to me. If they want to continue to support a controlling organization and toe the line, they are welcome to. I know what it's like to be in a cult and understand their \"reasoning\", no matter how much I now see it to be illogical and irrational.\n One month before your book was published, ' reported that you received a legal threat from Tom Cruise's lawyer, , that warned you would face a defamation lawsuit from Cruise if the book was made publicly available. Specific complaints made included your accounts of hearing about a \"drug history\" involving Cruise, an ultimatum made by the Scientology organization to Cruise to decide between or the organization, and that Cruise's personal assistants and employees that staff his home are chosen and paid for by the Scientology organization. Can you speak to how you came to have knowledge about these assertions you made, why you believe them to be true and factually accurate, and how you felt when you received the legal threat letter from Cruise's attorney?\nAS: Bertram Fields made a mistake by issuing that legal threat when he hadn't even read my book to know what I actually said about his client. He made assumptions based on hearsay. When I received the letter, I thought that it was just like Scientology \u2013 issue threats to intimidate and back someone off. I wasn't going to back off because what I wrote in my book was true. I am the one who did the project to hire Scientologists for Tom's household. I am the one Shelly Miscavige told what disqualifying drugs Tom took so he could not qualify for the Sea Organization \u2013 which he supposedly wanted to join. I didn't say anything in my book about Cruise having to decide between Nicole or the organization. So, I knew that it was an attempt to prevent me from putting out my book as \"little 'ol me\" could never possibly stand up to the high-powered lawyer of an A-list celebrity who has millions of dollars at his disposal. But the fact is \u2013 it didn't phase me as truth is truth and I'm willing to stand up for the truth.\n The book was subsequently published and made publicly available. At this point in time, has there been any follow-up from Tom Cruise, his lawyer, or representatives, to you? How do you feel about your legal standing if Cruise were to escalate the matter beyond the initial legal threat letter?\nAS: None, whatsoever and I highly doubt they would follow through with any lawsuit because what I stated in my book is truth. It's what I did myself. It's what I witnessed myself. What I reported in my book can be backed up with evidence and several witnesses \u2013 easily.\n The month your book was published, the ' reported that Scientology organization public representative characterized your accounts as \"fiction\". With regards to assertions you made that David Miscavige and Scientology officials \"snooped\" in the confessional folders of Scientology members and particularly celebrities, Davis stated, \"Nobody in the church has ever violated the priest-penitent privilege. ... [Confessional files] are held in the strictest confidence.\" How do you respond to these statements by Davis?\nAS: Just like I did to the New York Daily News when they asked me about it: If Scientology does not violate the priest-penitent privilege, what is the Scientology spokesperson doing talking to the press about my sex life?\n\"' Davis further stated to the \"New York Daily News\" that (separate from the earlier intimations from the lawyer for Tom Cruise) the Scientology organization was itself \"preparing a lawsuit\" against you because of the \"disgusting allegations\" in the book. Have you received any notice from the Scientology organization with regards such a potential lawsuit?\nAS: No and I don't expect to. Everything I've stated in my book are things that I personally observed (and where that wasn't the case, I make it clear). I was careful not to exaggerate, but to be as factual as possible about my experiences. There is so much more I could have said about severe abuse others witnessed and told me about, but I kept it to my story. As there are numerous witnesses now out of Scientology who also saw what I saw while working at the International Headquarters for Scientology, I do not think Miscavige and his attorneys would be very successful trying to prove my \"defamation\" and their innocence in front of a jury.\n\"' Davis proceeded to make claims to the \"New York Daily News\" about your sexual relationships. Additionally, BBC News reported that after you began to make public criticism of the organization and its leader David Miscavige, Scientology provided \"intimate details of her sex life\" to the Florida newspaper the \"St. Petersburg Times\". How did you feel when these sexual details were made public by Scientology? How do you feel this behavior by the organization and its officials reflects on its assertions of keeping confidential information secret, and respecting the privacy of priest-penitent privilege?\nAS: To me \u2013 and MANY other people \u2013 it was obvious through their child-like reaction that they have something fairly big to hide. I gave a detailed eye-witness account of the head of the Scientology religion repeatedly beating staff members. That they respond with exaggerated accusations about my sex life is just a red herring. And it also proves that private information you may divulge in confessionals while a member of Scientology could be used against you should you step out of line in the future.\n In an August 2009 issue of the Scientology publication, ', the issue referred to you multiple times only as \"The Adulteress\". How did this make you feel when you found out about this publication? When you were still a member of the Scientology organization, what was your opinion at that point in time of \"Freedom Magazine\"? What is your opinion of the publication - its reputability and reliability, at this point in time?\nAS: The \"Freedom\" magazine is the public mouthpiece for Scientology, often used as a medium to expose what they consider to be the ills of society (psychiatry, pharmaceutical companies and major critics of their religion). I was not surprised that they put out a magazine against those who exposed the illegal actions of the Scientology leader, David Miscavige, with his repeated abuse and assault and battery being committed on his junior Scientology executives. They felt that an attack on Miscavige was an attack on the whole religion and therefore those people involved needed to be exposed as rotten to the core.\nIn the August 2009 publication of \"Freedom\", they slandered both the \"St. Petersburg Times\" reporters and the \"defectors\" (myself, , Mike Rinder and Tom DeVocht). Note: they did not use the name \"Amy Scobee\" in this magazine. Instead, they refer to me as \"the Adulteress\". This slanderous character assassination appears in more than 20 places in their publication. It's painfully obvious that they were referring to me since I was the only female that spoke out in the article they were protesting. I'm not \"an adulteress\". As a member of Scientology's Sea Organization (age 16 to 42), I had sexual intercourse with my first husband, my second husband and my current husband. Regardless, my \"sexual purity\" has nothing to do with my reporting the fact that I witnessed the head of the Church of Scientology commit repeated assault &amp; battery on specific church executives while I was employed there. It's just their attempt to \"annihilate credibility\" for exposing this crime. In my view, the Freedom magazine is used to help carry out Miscavige's private agenda to try to remain in a position of power in that organization.\n BBC News reported on September 26, that during an interview for the ' special, \"\", yourself and reporter were photographed, and such photographs of the two of you hugging after completing the interview were sent by Scientology UK lawyers from the firm Carter-Ruck to the BBC. What do you think Scientology was attempting to accomplish by sending these photos to the BBC? Is such behavior by the Scientology organization with regard to monitoring of journalists, critics, or former members such as yourself common? What do you do to cope and/or respond to such behavior from the Scientology organization?\nAS: Yes, this type of intimidation is common practice by Scientology. As a witness in an on-going court case against Scientology, I was recently in a deposition with Scientology's lead counsel. He pulled out the photo that their private investigators took of John Sweeney giving me a hug on the highway outside of the Scientology compound in Hemet after nearly two full days of interviews. He proceeded to ask me how much \"alone time\" I spent with Mr. Sweeney (which was none) and when I explained that we all gave each other hugs goodbye before we went our separate ways and that my husband was right there with me, the lawyer said, \"We'll see what the jury says about that!\" All they are trying to do is intimidate us into silence through constant trails by PI's, slandering our names with ridiculous accusations, etc., so we'd become cowed, be quiet and let their criminality go on, unchecked. Well, it hasn't worked to keep me silent. To me, it's more important to prevent anyone else from being hurt by making Scientology's human rights violations known than to worry about them tarnishing my personal reputation in retaliation. I believe that the truth must be brought to light, despite consequences.\n Are there any other points that you would like to elaborate or explain?\nAS: I think it's very important for people to be educated on the subject of cults \u2013 including Scientology \u2013 so they know what to look out for and avoid. My book: \"Scientology - Abuse at the Top\", gives people a good look at what goes on behind the scenes and how one could get gradually more and more involved until it's their entire life \u2013 to the exclusion of almost anything or any one else. I hope it makes it into many people's hands and they find it useful.\n\"' Amy Scobee, thank you for taking the time to participate in this interview with \"Wikinews\".\nAS: Thank you.\nSources.\n __NOEDITSECTION__"}

Many of us are angry people at times. Some of us are angry and drunk\". His comments sparked outrage from bloggers, one of whom dismissed them as \"stupid generalisations.\" Another said that they were \"sure that Andrew Marr did not mean all bloggers, but it is unfortunate that he did not seem to make much of a distinction in his statement.\" Another blogger, writing on Twitter, said they supported Marr's arguments. \"Just read Andrew Marr's comments on blogging,\" they said. \"I blog and I agree with most of what he says.

He said that he had set up a webcam to record the event, and would post details later of a FTP server for people to watch.\nPeople responded to his post almost immediately. Some offered messages of hope, such as, \"How bad can it be? When everything is at its worst, it can only get better\", and \"Think of poor people, mutilated people, people who are lame or blind. Living with a disability is hard. They can not change their lives!

They also goaded him by saying, \"you won't dare, you are too cowardly\", and offering advice on the best way to hang himself: \"I recommend ... you do it from a height that you can jump off so you are guaranteed to break your neck.\"\nIn a later post, Jannes said that he had been feeling suicidal for about six months, but was too scared to actually attempt anything until he tried to strangle himself with his own hands. In response to questions, he stated that he was using a network cable to strangle himself because he didn't have any rope, but he was worried that the cable would not be strong enough to take his weight. He also told them that he had and , and was emotionally vulnerable and lacked normal social skills. He admitted to feeling lonely, and alluded to experiencing problems at school, but admitted that he had a good upbringing and had a rather good life. At around the same time, he also updated his Facebook status to say life was \"just too difficult\", and that he was going to kill himself.\nBroadcast of suicide.\nA short while later, at 1:06 p.m., Jannus posted the FTP server URL and login details, and stated that he needed to hurry up because, \"I'm beginning to feel that I might change my mind.\" At this point, people who logged on to the server found a series of still images taken every two seconds, showing a young man dressed in sweatpants and t-shirt, in his apartment, hanging network cable from a doorway.\nAt 1:13 p.m., the images show that Jannus stepped out of the shot, and at this point he posted another message to Flashback. \"Alright, let's do it,\" he said. The next series of images show him walking back to the cable and hooking it around his neck. He slumps to the floor, and his body begins shaking while his head and arms turn dark purple until he stops moving. His skin color then lessens to a pink-red shade as his limp body hangs motionless for a number of minutes.\nOn the message board, people start to realize the seriousness of the events: \"Given the last pictures, it looks like [this was serious]\", \"holy crap, he has done it already\", \"okay it's getting nasty\", \"this is quite sick. Not okay at all,\" and \"I've seen a lot online but this is the worst I've seen in my entire life\" were some of the comments posted.

Rhee, who has held the position for over three years, will be replaced by Deputy Chancellor Kaya Henderson at the end of this month.\nRhee, aged 40, chose to step down after current Washington, D.C. Mayor failed to be reelected in a primary election last month. Fenty, who had long backed Rhee's educational policies, lost to D.C. City Council Chairman . In a Wednesday morning press conference, Rhee said that she and Gray decided together that she should resign. \"This was not a decision that we made lightly,\" she said, \"but it is one that I believe is absolutely essential to allow Chairman Gray to pursue our shared goal of unifying the city behind the school reform efforts that are making such a large difference in the lives of the children across the city. In short we have agreed together that the best way to keep the reforms going is for this reformer to step aside.\"\nRhee said she \"completely enjoyed every minute of\" her tenure as chancellor, and that leaving is \"the right thing for the school system and the right thing most importantly for the children of D.C.\" She was charged by Fenty in 2007 to improve the city's failing public school district, but her no-nonsense tactics caused much controversy among other educators and the D.C. community, despite managing to raise test scores and lowering dropout rates.\nIn July, Rhee took drastic measures to reform the city's educational system by firing 241 teachers and putting 737 more on notice to improve in one year or lose their jobs as well. She pushed for performance-based evaluations, following recommendations in U.S. President Barack Obama's \"\" initiative. Teacher unions and other educators, along with city residents, criticized Rhee's actions. Chester Finn, president of the for education research, says that many people find mass layoffs and school closings troubling, even in the name of reform.\nFenty, who made Rhee head of D.C. schools in June 2007, lost his reelection bid in part due to his support of Rhee's methods. Fenty said at the press conference that she \"exceeded all of [his] expectations.\" It wasn't just the results, he said, it was Rhee's \"tough decision-making, what residents believe is a breath of fresh air, and a willingness to do what is right even if it has political consequences.\"\nGray, who is now running for mayor unopposed, agreed to a deal in which Henderson would become interim chancellor after Rhee leaves at the end of the month. The current educational leadership team will remain unchanged until the end of the school year to avoid any possible disruption of classes. Even though she is leaving, Rhee said, \"All of the reforms can continue as planned.\" Those reforms include the new evaluation system, changes to special education, and expansion of standardized testing. However, former Assistant says that Rhee's departure shows that her tactics will be unsuccessful in the long run. \"Rhee is out because her patron lost the election, and that loss should have taught the leaders of this movement that they are headed in the wrong direction. Public schools cannot be reformed without public support,\" wrote Ravitch.\nDuring the press conference, Gray said that \"school reform will move forward under the Gray administration. Our schools must continue to operate under the leadership of a strong, empowered chancellor who will move school reform forward, take it to the next level and work with the community so that all our stakeholders are invested in the process.\" When asked why Rhee would not be retained as chancellor, Gray said that it was a \"mutual decision\" for her to step down.\nRhee was featured in the recent documentary \"\", which highlights issues with the country's school systems. She became \"a pivotal leader in the school reform movement,\" said U.S. Secretary of Education . Fenty praised Rhee's accomplishments, saying, \"All across the country now because of Chancellor Rhee and her team, from the White House to documentaries, people are touting D.C. as a model for how to attack bureaucracy and get results in an urban school system.\"\nAlthough she has not publicly disclosed her next steps, Rhee said that her \"goal is to continue to serve the children of this nation.\" She plans to \"take a little time off and figure out what's next,\" but will be going to California to marry her fianc\u00e9, Mayor .

Morlock is accused of killing Afghan civilians for sport; at least eleven other soldiers are caught up in the allegations.\nThe prosecution case is that Morlock colluded with Sergeant Calvin Gibbs to plot the deaths of Afghans. Gibbs is said to have planned the attacks which Morlock helped arrange by recruiting other soldiers to carry them out. The pair, as well as three others charged with murder, deny this. Gibbs's lawyer said his client's defence is that the Afghans were killed legitimately, while Morlock's said his client was present but did not cause any deaths. Preliminary hearings in the case were heard last month.\nThe five are accused of unprovoked grenade and gun attacks. Seven other soldiers are accused of conspiring to cover up the crimes by dismemberment of the corpses and collecting body parts. No other cases have yet been committed for trial, including that of Gibbs. All the soldiers are from the 5th Stryker brigade, which went to Afghanistan last year and has seen combat in Kandahar, where the alleged attacks occurred between January and May this year.\nMorlock is also going to stand trial for assault, use of a controlled substance (), attempting to block an investigation, conspiracy to murder, conspiracy to assault and \"wrongfully photographing and possessing visual images of human casualties\". The soldiers are accused of photographing their victims and keeping body parts as trophies, though the military has not yet commented on if bones they say the men took were in fact from civilian murder victims. \"Al Jazeera English\" reports that much media attention has focused on this detail.\nThe seven not charged with murder are also charged with assault and using hashish. The assault charge relates to the beating of a whistleblower. Morlock could have faced the death penalty on the premeditated murder charges, but the army has decided not to seek this sentence upon a conviction and instead the maximum sentence available is life without parole.\nOfficials have commented about concerns the case could have a negative impact on relations with the Afghan public, especially with regards to efforts to undermine Taliban support in Kandahar."}

Health officials are referring to the event as the worst outbreak of the cough in 60 years. \nA spokesman from the , Michael Sicilia, says all of the deaths occurred in infants under three months and that nine of the deaths were found in infants under eight weeks old. This leads to the conclusion that the children were too young to receive the vaccine for the disease. \nSicilia indicated that an estimated 50% of children received the disease from parents or caregivers. Earlier in July of this year California recommended that anyone over seven years old who was not fully vaccinated for Pertussis get a Tdap pertussis booster.\nSome parents are refusing to have their children vaccinated against the disease and the vaccine has worn off in some adults. Alison Patti, a spokesperson from the (CDC), pointed out that the vaccine does not protect individuals indefinitely and health officials are urging that people get the vaccine again if they have not received it within the past five years.\nAccording to the CDC, for the first week or two the symptoms of the cough are similar to the common cold; soon after the child begins to \"cough violently and rapidly, over and over, until the air is gone from their lungs and they're forced to inhale with a loud 'whooping' sound.\" Pertussis carries side effects, such as a 20 percent chance of pneumonia and about a one percent chance of convulsions, which makes it very deadly to infants.\nDoctors and parents often miss the symptoms of whooping cough in infants under six months old due to the absence of the \"whooping\" sound. Alison Patti said that the \"whooping\" characteristic is absent in adults which makes them think they don't have pertussis. She recommends that anyone with a persistent cough get tested for the whooping cough.\nExternal links.\nPertussis (Whooping Cough) \u2013 What You Need To Know"}

It was right in front of us [in front of Las Terrazas beach, near \"the grotto of the Virgin\"], and was made smithereens by the tsunami,\" he told \"Wikinews\".\n\"I have always worked on selling cochayuyo here, and the terrain where my kiosk was located before has been disputed by private people, and the municipality approved that. I talked with the Mayor and he said 'I don't know what's going on the beach'; that left me perplexed. [...] I like the new design of the kiosks, they are larger, and we can do more things with it, but they are way too expensive,\" he added. Mr. Mella also gave \"Wikinews\" a sample of his work as \"the King of the Cochayuyo\", an essay called \"El cochayuyo es una mina repleta de nutrientes y sales minerales\" (\"Cochayuyo is a mine full of nutrients and mineral salts\", pictured below), which he sells for 200 Chilean pesos (0.41 US$), and that contains \"tips and information about the plant, and some recipes.\""}

The Finnish telecommunications company Nokia, being one of the few hardware manufacturers who use the system on some of the models, announced that it has taken over the 's development.\nNokia had acquired Symbian Foundation in 2008. Now, the foundation refused to continue the project, because this smartphone operating system had lost its popularity when Android came to market.\nDuring the next several months, most Symbian Foundation employees, who were completely governing the project previously, will retire.\nBy April 2011, only the licensing team will stay to oversee the project.\nThe executive director of the Symbian Foundation Tim Holbrow explained the change, saying that \"There has since been a seismic change in the mobile market but also more generally in the economy, which has led to a change in focus for some of our funding board members. The result of this is that the current governance structure for the Symbian platform \u2014 the foundation \u2014 is no longer appropriate.\"\nInstead, Nokia takes over the development of the system. This is possible because the Symbian OS is currently open source and freely redistributable. In an interview with , the head of Nokia smartphone business Jo Harlow said that the takeover was in significant part because Nokia hardware was the major one using the OS. The development environment would be switched to for the system to support cross-platform applications use and development.

's Police Constable Stephen Mitchell faced five counts of rape, six of and 15 of . He is guilty of two rapes, three indecent assaults and six counts of misconduct, with most of the sex charge convictions coming yesterday.\nIn all the case involved 16 women aged from 17 to 48, all of whom were arrested on drugs charges or shoplifting thefts between 1999 and 2006; the prosecution said Mitchell picked his victims based on vulnerability. The prosecution claimed Mitchell used blackmail to demand sex in exchange for favours; Mitchell described a conspiracy to frame him involving \"...a very small-knit community in Newcastle city centre's criminal fraternity.\" Mitchell's defence dismissed the claims as driven by one woman motivated by \"self-preservation;\" he refused to explain this further in open court.\nIt was alleged he told one woman who wanted a female officer present when searched said \"I am the law. I can do anything. I don't need a woman here,\" and later attacked her in his patrol car. The woman had been arrested for possession of drugs and was 37. \n\"Each [victim] was vulnerable, whether because of drug abuse, health problems, domestic circumstances or a combination of these factors. The defendant took advantage of their vulnerabilities, usually providing or offering favours, but then requesting, or in some cases requiring by force, sexual favours in return,\" was how prosecutor Paul Sloan QC explained the circumstances early in the trial.\nTestimony in October included that of one lesbian, now 32, who in June 1999 was interviewed by the officer in Newcastle's Pilgrim Street police station, and claimed he groped her and \"that was the beginning of hell for me\". She told the court from behind a screen how he undid his trousers, saying that in arranging for her to be bailed he had helped her and he expected this reciprocated. \"I was gay and had never had sex with a male,\" but she claimed she was grabbed by the hair and forced, with a warning her girlfriend would be contacted if she made allegations. She had been arrested for cheque fraud.\nShe said the next month she was arrested again and he made a similar demand. Her testimony stated that he blackmailed her for four years, receiving regular sex after driving her into the country, culminating in a 2003 handcuffed rape at her home. She told the court he gave her drug money, as well as a lighter and foil to take heroin, after discovering she was in rehab. She says she pretended to take the drug but disposed of it, leaving rehab and beginning to study in 2002 in the belief the man had been evaded. \nHowever, \"[my] world just crumbled before me\" when he arrived at her door and stole her spare keys, she said. She claimed he regularly visited her house when she was away and once left a knife embedded in her pillow. She testified her fear made her sleep beneath her bed. Her testimony stated the policeman used what he said was video evidence of her committing fraud at a Post Office and in 2003 said he was going to hand the tape over. \nShe said when he arrived \"[h]e was furious, he said I had disrespected him by not being in touch. I was trying to calm him down but he handcuffed me and said he was arresting me for fraud at the post office. He threw me over the settee, I couldn\u2019t move with the handcuffs on, I was petrified. He said this is what you\u2019ve wanted for a long time and he raped me.\" She moved to shortly after.\nDetective Constable Cath Easton of Northumbria Police's Professional Standards Unit said she visited one woman in June last year during the investigation. Although stating she had no problems with police treatment, Easton testified the woman called the following day. \"She was crying, she was hysterical,\" Easton told the court.\n\"It took her a while to get her words out, but she was saying 'how do I know I can trust you? How do I know he has not sent you to test us?' She was frightened and she told us she was frightened. She was in a real state... She was absolutely terrified that he knew I had contacted her.\" \nThe alleged victim was assured the investigation was genuine and later called again, claiming Mitchell forced her to perform a sex act following the former heroin addict's arrest six years previously. Another woman told the court Mitchell raped her whilst in uniform in the woman's flat, hands cuffed behind her, and blackmailed her for years demanding sexual favours.\nOne woman, 25 at the time, said while in Newcastle's Pilgrim Street police station following her arrest for a minor offence she was grabbed and kissed by the policeman. \"He put his hands on my shoulders and kissed me, it was a passionate kiss. The door was open and I was shocked, anyone could have walked past or seen him or anything.\" She told the court this occurred in the fingerprint room. \n\"After I was photographed he told me he was finishing his shift, which I took to be a hint,\" the witness, another former heroin addict who said she was drunk at the time, continued. \"Then when I came out of the station PC Mitchell pulled up in a car and offered to take me home, it seemed the safest way of getting home was with a police officer.\" She had no complaint about him during the journey but said she resisted another kiss upon arrival at her house.\nThe woman, who says she has not used drugs for nine years, stated that he arrived at her house the following day and gave her a second lift. \u201cHe said he had a wife and kids but that he would like to see me again. Obviously it was never going to happen but he was saying he wanted some kind of relationship where he was seeing me on a regular basis, I would imagine for sex or something like that. He said we would have to be discreet because he had a wife but I was not interested and eventually he accepted my \u2018no\u2019.\" \nShe said he gave her money, suggested they get a private room and was \"very persuasive\". Her mother also gave evidence to say Mitchell had called her to discuss the daughter's drug-addict boyfriend. \"You want to stop her going with him, he's trouble, he's a bad lad,\" she claimed Mitchell said, adding her daughter told her the officer \"was pestering her, she said he wanted to take her out.\" The boyfriend also gave evidence, saying he had known the officer during former heroin addiction and giving a description of him.\nOne young mother met Mitchell when released from prison in 2001 after a theft sentence. Days later, he had given her heroin and felt she \"owed him\" according to testimony, receiving sex in return. She failed to attend Gateshead Magistrates' Court in December the following year and he arrested her, she told the court. She wept, claiming he raped her in his vehicle. \"I could not get out of the car, the doors were locked,\" she told the trial.\n\"He said he wanted to have sex and that it would be the last time. I was shouting for him to let me out of the car, just screaming and shouting at him to let me go. He said if I told anybody, nobody would believe me because I was just a dirty junkie and I would never get my children back,\" she said, describing him telling her he would plant drugs at her home and prevent access to her children if she made claims against him.\nIn November a woman in her fifties, who has four children and was 48 during her alleged attack, testified Mitchell raped her in a room used for reading reports at Pilgrim Street following her July 2006 theft arrest. \"No one's going to believe a thief,\" he is claimed to have told her. \"I said if you just let me go I'm not going to say anything; I'm not going to tell anyone. No one will ever know this has happened. I just wanted to be away.\" She says she explained she was ill and taking cancer medication although \"he did not seem bothered.\"\nOutside the police station following the alleged attack, \"...there was two young lasses coming along. I will always remember one had a red Berghaus coat on. They seemed to know PC Mitchell and he did not seem to know whether to stay with me or talk to them and I just walked straight across the road. I was in total shock. I got on the bus home and I was trying to keep from crying and I had a pain in my throat.\" \nShe said her life had been severely affected; \"I was always thinking about it and crying for no reason. I just used to burst into tears for no reason and I\u2019m not a crying person. I\u2019m normally bubbly and happy and I really just let myself go. I never ever went with my partner again and from that day to this I have never slept with another man.\" She triggered the probe that resulted in Mitchell's prosecution by reporting him when, she says, he began arriving at her house.\nShe told Sloan she had not immediately contacted police because \"I thought no-one would believe me. I was a shoplifter and he was a police officer. I still would never have been here to this day if he had not kept coming back to the house. If he had not done that it would have been a secret till the day I died.\"\nMitchell, who has been a policeman since leaving the military in 1991, stated in the dock this month that the women had discussed their \"host of rumours\" amongst themselves and they were similar for this reason. \"I think it has been demonstrated that people have been talking about this on a number of occasions... I know these people are not always truthful.\" \"But you are?\" responded prosecution QC Paul Sloan. \"Yes, these people will grab any opportunity they can,\" according to the officer. \"They are lying,\" he later added.\nIn an attempt to disprove this defence the prosecution produced a sex tape in which Mitchell uses similar phrases to his partner as the women alleged he had said to them. \"So it just so happens the words used are exactly the words you used in the video?\" Sloan inquired. PC Mitchell desribed this as coincidence and rejected claims he had used such words to any of the women. He also said supplying heroin to one addict was far too risky for him; \"I know police monitor drug dealers\u2019 homes and it would be a massive risk to take my vehicle to the address of a drug dealer. I don't want people to be on drugs. If I could help them I would.\"\nMitchell, 42, divorced in 2005, admitted meeting a woman he had met on duty for sex in 2006, having admitted the same at an internal misconduct hearing in September 2007. He told the court that if interviewing woman it was in his interests as an officer to be friendly, but insisted this was all. \nDefended by Toby Hedworth QC, Mitchell said his father's murder meant he could not possibly have committed one rape in Burdon, near Sunderland, on August 31, 2001 as he had returned to his original home city of Glasgow following his father's murder. He was accused of raping the woman in a parked car in a field. \n\"Have you ever been with her in the fields in the Burdon area of Sunderland?\" asked Hedworth. \"No, I haven\u2019t. My dad was attacked on July 30, 2001 by somebody and subsequently died on August 10, 2001.\" Hedworth: \"Had your father in fact been murdered?\" Mitchell: \"Yes. And from the 9th to the 16th of August I was in Glasgow,\" he explained. Hedworth took him through denials of every charge, which he said there was \"no truth whatsoever\" in.\nThe defence also produced a recording secretly recorded by Mitchell with Detective Chief Inspector Chris Sharman, who headed the rape investigation. Hedworth told the court Mitchell is warned on the tape, made in March, that if he is charged he would \"probably be front page of the national newspapers and they are horrible\" but the team would \"stop digging\" if he stepped down.\nHedworth likened the offer to a \"get out of jail free card\" and claimed despite a warning his client was \"running the risk of going to jail and going on the sex offender register\", Mitchell chose to fight the allegations - a fact which demonstrated innocence. \"What it means is: \u2018Resign and this will go away\u2019.\" The prosecution denied Northumbria Police were seeking to offer their colleague an alternative to investigation, stating the allegation - made during Hedworth's closing speech - was untrue and the recording did not indicate an offer to drop the probe.\nThe jury began deliberations on Wednesday. After three days, on Friday they cleared Mitchell of three rapes, two indecent assaults and two counts of misconduct in a public office. Following this, trial judge Mr Justice Wilkie said he would accept majority verdicts on the remaining charges, instead of unanimous verdicts. The jury departed for the weekend, returning on Tuesday to convict him of six misconduct charges and clear him of the same number; another indecent assault charge also produced an acquital.\nYesterday, the verdicts were delivered on the remaining charges. The remaining seven misconduct charges were acquitals, as did the other indecent assaults. Two charges of rape and three of indecent assault produced guilty verdicts. \nAt least one of the misconduct charges he was convicted of was unrelated to indecent assault or rape; it concerned a drug-addicted woman caught with non-prescriped (valium) when her friend was arrested for shoplifting in 2003. Her testimony was that he stroked her leg and tried to kiss her in Pilgrim Street, returned the drugs upon her release, obtained her number and met her several times to give her drugs. She says although he asked to go at night to a hotel she refused, and ultimately she began ignoring his calls while he ceased supplying drugs."}

Events included a 'study-in' at the Edinburgh headquarters, a 10am protest in attended by thousands, and a 'dress in red' march in Manchester.\nIn Cardiff, at least a hundred students rallied outside the main gates of 's main building, in an event organised by a group named Actions Against Cuts Cardiff, with the support of a member of the executive committee. Occupations of university buildings have also begun in Birmingham, Plymouth, and the Royal Holloway. \nIn London, students are infuriated by what they say is 's decision to ban anti-cut related meetings from their campus earlier this month. One student described it as \"undemocratic and scandalous\" as, according to the students, they were forced out of their booked room by security guards, and prevented from partaking on any on-campus meetings -- but South Bank University maintains that it was a \"misunderstanding\" due to a double-booked room. Dr. Phil Cardew, Pro Vice-Chancellor of LSBU, maintained that \"freedom of speech lies at the very heart of the higher education community whether it is academic, political or social debate\", and that \"the students were encouraged to continue their discussions in the Students Union\".\nNot all the demonstrations were peaceful. Central London saw two officers injured as the police attempted to hold back the protesters, a police van attacked and vandalised, and three arrests were made. Police, keen to make sure that the 30 Millbank occupation was not repeated, were out in force, clashing with students in Cambridge, where two arrests were made, and protesters of up to a thousand, according to protest organisers, as dusk approached.\nThe group that organised the protests, the \"National Campaign Against Fees And Cuts\" (NCAFAC), told students in the run-up to the protests to not \"be afraid of blocking traffic if you have enough people\".

In Westminster, a student suspected of throwing a fire extinguisher off the headquarters' roof pleaded guilty in court today, under the charge of violent disorder, and will appear in Southwark Crown Court at a later date for sentencing, the maximum of which is five years imprisonment.

He stated there is no possibility any of the 29 men still inside could have survived.\nThe situation began on Friday, around 3:45pm local time, with an explosion at the mine which is about halfway between the West Coast towns of Greymouth and Reefton. Emergency services began responding at 4.53pm; two miners managed to walk out and were treated for minor injuries at Grey Base Hospital, with 27 originally believed missing.\nGrey District Mayor Tony Kokshoorn initially stated: \"We are holding on to hope. Look at Chile, all those miners were trapped and they all came out alive.\"\nEarly Saturday, Pike River Coal chief executive Peter Whittall reported 29 were trapped underground, ranging from 17 to 62 years old.

Media briefings were also held twice daily.\nFamilies and the public began to feel frustration that rescuers had not yet moved into the mine. The search co-ordinator Superintendent Garry Knowles explained that the gas levels in the mine meant that the risk of another explosion was too high to allow entry. The Police Commissioner, Minister of Police, and Prime Minister all confirmed they supported the decision not to send rescuers in while expert analysis showed the mine was still unsafe.\nThe New Zealand Defence Force supplied a bomb-disposal robot to take video footage inside the mine. However, the robot only made it 550 metres up the tunnel before being shorted out by water in the mine. Later, the robot was restarted; this time it made it 1000 metres in before running out of battery. A second Defence robot was also sent in and recorded some video footage. A 160 metre long bore-hole was drilled from the surface into an area deeper in the mine to gauge the gas levels in areas closer to where the miners could be. It was reported that the samples from that bore-hole were showing up to 95 percent methane.\nAt a press conference on Wednesday afternoon, Superintendent Knowles reported that there had been a second large explosion at 2:37pm, at least as big as the first. \"Unfortunately I have to inform the public of New Zealand that at 2.37pm today there was another massive explosion underground and based on that explosion no one survived.\" He said the rescue team and experts believed survival was impossible. The Grey District Mayor reported that a recovery team had gone in while gas levels were still low. In a more extended briefing, the Pike River Mining chief executive explained this had not occurred as the mine was still too dangerous, but said they would do everything they could to recover the bodies.\nInternational leaders including Queen Elizabeth have sent their condolences."}

The child suffered broken ribs and brain damage. Lord Uist said staff at Woodside Medical Group might have been able to prevent the death but failed to realise the baby was being hurt deliberately.\nSheach had initially been unable to get an appointment at Aberdeen-based Woodside for her daughter; instead, Dr Mohammed Athar spoke on the phone with Sheach and prescribed three drugs without seeing the infant.

He also criticised the delay in seeing a doctor, saying \"[i]t is my opinion the appointments system operated at this surgery may require urgent review so as to ensure children requiring urgent attention receive it by being seen by a doctor.\"\nHe continued \"[w]hether the death of baby Alexis could have been prevented had she been so referred is a matter which, in my opinion, merits a very full inquiry. The training of GPs, and also health visitors, to detect signs of non-accidental injury may be a matter that requires further consideration.\" \nThe same day as these comments, announced that a will occur. \"These are very serious criticisms by Lord Uist of the way the health services operated,\" said health spokesman Murdo Fraser. \"Clearly, there were serious failings in relation to this baby's treatment and lessons have to be learned from this case.\"\nThe health board stated \" and the Woodside Medical Practice would like to extend their condolences to Alexis\u2019s family. We understand that Lord Uist has issued a statement that it is critical of perceived failings in the care given to Alexis.

The small sample shows, over several months, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Kuwait and Bahrain asserting that further sanctions against Iran will likely have no effect.\nEarly November last year, General discussed the situation with King of Bahrain, who argued for the use of force to thwart Iran's nuclear ambitions; stating: \"The danger of letting it go on is greater than the danger of stopping it.\"\nIn that meeting concern was expressed that more Arab involvement in Iraq was needed to frustrate Iranian plans. Petraeus was told Bahrain sought Egyptians and Saudis support, but talks with the latter revealed no interest in taking a leading r\u00f4le.\nThe King did welcome the prospect of India becoming involved in the region as a stabilising influence.\nA mid-December meeting between Crown Prince of the UAE and US Deputy Secretary of Energy saw the subject brought up again. In a discussion that touched on the two countries renewable energy plans, and reliable movement of oil through the , the Prince asserted Iran saw itself as spearheading a campaign for a \"Persian Empire in the 21st Century.\" Alleging Iran has established \"emirates\" in Kuwait, Bahrain, Eastern Saudi Arabia, Southern Iraq, Yemen, and South Lebanon, his picture of Iranian nuclear ambitions is \"Al-Qaeda is not going to get a nuclear bomb; Iran is a matter of time.\"\nThe Prince was keen to stress that those in power are the same people who, .\nSubsequent talks between a congressional appropriations sub-committee and UAE's Foreign Minister were the scene of equally serious predictions. The sub-committee, consisting of , , , and , heard from Sheikh that if Iran became a nuclear state the rest of the region would likely follow suit.\nPlans to keep the fifteen-millions-plus barrels of oil passing through the Strait of Hormuz each day moving were discussed. Whilst keen to weaken Iranian ties with China, Sheikh Abdullah stressed the 50 billion in trade between the two; this being considered an obstacle to China backing, and enforcing, a stronger sanctions regime.\nThe sub-committee's Emirates host, like many in the region, stated progress on the Israeli peace process was a good route to de-escalation.\nA meeting in February this year with Kuwaiti Interior Minister was the scene of comparable warnings. Alongside discussions on travel restrictions to be enforced against former Guantanamo Bay detainees, he described Iran as the \"beating heart\" of Islamic Extremism.\nConcerns over Iran's involvement in Yemen were discussed, with the minister saying Iran is intent on exporting its revolution; that its nuclear ambitions can only be thwarted by force.\nUpdating the US on perceived Iranian actions, he claimed they were attempting to infiltrate Egypt by recruiting the poor. And, they were becoming involved in the drugs trade, shipping narcotics into Yemen to fund militants.\nThe cable on the Kuwait meeting closes referring recipients to a wiki page: http://www.intelink.sgov.gov/wiki/Portal:Kuwait. \"Wikinews\" has been informed this is a page on the US intelligence community's ; an internally-maintained project, based on the same technology as \"Wikipedia\", and intended for use in building intelligence dossiers on countries, regions, their politicians, diplomats, plus political and terrorist groups.\nA cable originating in from January this year is corroborated by later U.S. news reports; hinting that the Iranian government may indeed be using tactics more reminiscent of the cold-war.\nIn the opening weeks of the year, London-based Voice of America commentator Ali Reza Nourizadeh was advised that Mohammed Reza Sadeqinia intended to target him for assassination, along with others. Sadeqinia was previously arrested in California, and prosecuted for attempting to hire a hit man. The target at that time was reported to be Iranian-American broadcaster Jamshid Sharmahd, one of the main figures behind Tondar \u2014 a loose collection of in-exile Iranians opposed to the current regime.\nTehran insists Tondar is a terrorist organisation, accusing it of being responsible for a 2008 bombing that killed 14.\nSadeqinia, who worked as a painter in Ann Arbour, was arrested on July 28, 2009 near Los Angeles International Airport in possession of thousands of dollars and an Iranian passport. FBI investigations into his possible Iranian government ties were still ongoing a month before his scheduled release in July this year. \nFound guilty by Los Angeles Superior Court of attempting to hire someone to murder Sharmahd, he had been expected to spend around a year in jail. Tondar spokesman Iman Afar, in the lead up to Sedeqina's release, expressed concern for his own safety and that of others in the L.A. area."}

Reports at the time showed magistrates considered actions at Guantanamo Bay torture, and seemed keen to pursue ex-US government officials on grounds of \"criminal responsibility\".\nCable 06MADRID1914 highlights the cases of Hamed Abderrahaman Ahmed and Moroccan Lahcen Ikassrien; respectively transferred from Guantanamo Bay, to Spanish custody, in February 2004 and July 2005.\nDescribing conditions at the Cuban detention centre as \"impossible to explain, much less justify\", Hamed \u2014 better known as the \"Spanish Taliban\" \u2014 saw a July 2006 ruling by the country's Supreme Court annul his six-year prison sentence, granting him an immediate release. The ruling cast doubt on the reliability of evidence against Lahcen, who was released on bail.\nHamed and his family, at the time, announced their intent to sue the US government over his suffering in Guantanamo Bay.\nLater cables illustrate how concerned the Bush administration were over possible prosecution by . Citing an op-ed he penned for a Spanish paper in March 2007, and this subsequently being picked up by Socialist Party secretary . Pronouncements by the two, and others, on \"criminal responsibility\" were met with a diplomatically stern response; cable 07MADRID546 states that the government of Spain was \"cautioned that continued statements on this issue by senior Spanish figures would be viewed negatively.\"\nGarz\u00f3n, best-known for indicting former dictator Augusto Pinochet, seemed to still trouble US diplomats when planning high-level defence talks in March 2007. Mention is made to a possible investigation, and indictment of, Donald Rumsfeld. Spain had informed the US embassy in Madrid the judge in the case was working to dismiss it.\nAs recently as March last year, Garz\u00f3n sought to prosecute officials from the Bush administration.\nNamed as potential defendants in a \"Reuters\" report, , , , , and, aide to Vice-President Dick Cheney, were all being investigated by Garz\u00f3n.\nCome April this year, Garz\u00f3n himself faced prosecution. A probe into Franco-era war crimes saw him suspended, possibly to be tried for acting contrary to an amnesty extended to Franco supporters. It is alleged he \"acted without jurisdiction\".\nAt present, the former Spanish Supreme Court judge is working at the . Reports based on \"El Pais\"' investigation around the leaked cables suggest the country's judiciary has been politicised to suit American interests.\nWith a price of 85,000 cited for each former Guantanamo Bay detainee that Spain was to take, recent reports assert other countries have been offered financial incentives to help empty the camp.\nBelgium, alongside Spain, was supposedly offered more influence within the European Union in exchange for cooperating with US plans.\nKuwait's interior minister is said to have refused to take any of their citizens from the camp. Describing inmates as \"rotten\", \"DPA\" alleges he told the US to \"get rid of\" detainees in an Afghan war zone.\nYemen, in exchange for agreeing to take Guantanamo detainees, is said to have asked for US$11 million for the construction of a centre to rehabilitate Muslim extremists.\nSo far, only a tiny fraction of the documents in Wikileaks possession have been made public."}

Interpol, the International Criminal Police Organization, yesterday released a \"\" calling for Assange's arrest. Interpol stated that this type of notice is not an arrest warrant, but a request \"to assist the national police forces in identifying or locating those persons with a view to their arrest and extradition.\"\nThe incidents are alleged to have occurred in August of this year, several weeks after Assange released 75,000 documents detailing US military actions in Afghanistan. \"The background is that he has to be heard in this investigation and we haven't been able to get a hold of him to question him,\" said Marianne Ny, director of prosecution in Sweden. \nIt was first reported that he was suspected of rape later in August, when he described the allegations as part of a \"smear campaign\" against Wikileaks. \"Wikinews\" reported at the time that he said \"the charges are without basis and their issue at this moment is deeply disturbing.\" A statement posted on Wikileaks' website after the charges were announced defended Assange. \"We are deeply concerned about the seriousness of these allegations. We the people behind WikiLeaks think highly of Julian and he has our full support. While Julian is focusing on his defenses and clearing his name, WikiLeaks will be continuing its regular operations.\"\nAssange's lawyer, Mark Stephens, said that the allegations against him were made after the two women he is alleged to have raped found out that he was in relationships with both at the same time. \"Only after the women became aware of each other's relationships with Mr. Assange did they make their allegations against him,\" Stephens said in a statement. \nStephens added that he had not \"received a single written word, at any time, in any form, from Swedish authorities on the Swedish investigation against our client,\" and he and Assange had only learnt about the case through reports in the media. \"[This is] a clear contravention to , which states that every accused must be informed promptly, in a language which he understands and in detail, of the nature and cause of the accusation against him,\" he added.\nAssange is currently residing in an unknown location. It has been reported he has attempted to disguise himself by cutting and dying his hair. He told recently that Wikileaks has obtained documents containing evidence of corruption within a major US bank. He has reportedly been paying in cash and with friends' credit cards. \nSpeaking about the release of the cables, he told : \"US officials have for 50 years trotted out this line when they are afraid the public is going to see how they really behave.\" It was reported on Wednesday that Ecuador, a country which critically opposes US policies, has offered Assange residency.\nAlong with the arrest, Assange is facing mounting pressure in the US over the leak of the cables. A retired CIA agent, Peter King, said Wikileaks should be designated a \"terrorist organisation,\" and called for Wikileaks and Assange to be prosecuted for the release.\nOn Monday evening, Hillary Clinton, , condemned the publishing of the files, thought to be leaked by , who served as an intelligence analyst with the US Army before being arrested. \n\"It is an attack on the international community, the alliances and partnerships, the conversations and negotiations, that safeguard global security and advance economic prosperity,\" Clinton said. \"There is nothing laudable about endangering innocent people, and there is nothing brave about sabotaging peaceful relations between nations on which our common security depends.\" She added that the US \"deeply regrets\" the leakage of the files.\nSpeaking to on the internet, Assange defended the release of the files. \"It is not our goal to achieve a more transparent society, it's our goal to achieve a more just society,\" he said.

Let us make history together,\" he said. Some analysts had suggested that Russia would not win the right to host the tournament, since Prime Minister Vladimir Putin had decided not to travel to Zurich, but remained in Moscow. FIFA President Sepp Blatter said of Russia: \"I am sure that to organise the World Cup in that region, or that continent, it will do a lot of good for this part of the world.\"\nRussia captain said he was \"very, very happy\" with the result. \"It is going to have a huge impact in sports, in our economy, in the development of the country and even in politics. The influence of football in the world is huge. You can see that even today with the presentations and those who were making them,\" he said. \"It\u2019s going to be the best World Cup in history because Russians are so hospitable. I hope it will change the way that Europe and the world view Russia\u2014and hopefully change the opinion of Russian people too.\"\n'Today we celebrate, but tomorrow, the work begins'.\nSheikh , the ruling of Qatar, praised FIFA for \"believing in change\". Al Thani, who was in Zurich for the announcement, added: \"We have worked very hard over past two years to get to this point. Today we celebrate, but tomorrow, the work begins. We acknowledge there is a lot of work for us to do, but we also stand by our promise that we will deliver.\" Qatar urged FIFA to take \"a bold gamble\" by hosting the event in the Middle East for the first time. While only 1.7 million people live in Qatar, the bid representatives said that football is popular there. It was thought that there may be concerns that the extreme heat in Qatar would put the delegates off. Hassan Al-Thawadi, the chief executive of the bid, played down the fears. \"We know it would be a bold gamble and an exciting prospect but with no risk,\" he said. \"Heat is not and will not be an issue.\"\n\"Everyone is celebrating in the Middle East; everyone was behind us since the very beginning.

I\u2019m so proud that the Middle East was recognised by FIFA. We are so privileged to have a tournament like this coming to our region for the first time. It shows the value of FIFA and what it stands for as an organisation. As I promised, we will not let FIFA down. Everything we have promised until now will become a reality.\" Speaking about why Qatar won the bid, he said: \"What made us different is that we pushed the boundaries; we created new concepts, things which were not conventional but still very possible, very realistic for a country like ours. Therefore we are very proud to represent a new era, a new age for FIFA to look towards the future\u2014the World Cup is for everyone. \n'We gave it our best shot'.\nThere was disappointment in the countries which were beaten by Russia and Qatar. \"Naturally we are hugely disappointed.

All you can do is wish Russia well and hope they have a really good World Cup but I wish it was us.\" A journalist in Spain reported that there was \"bitter disappointment here amongst Spanish fans,\" and added that the economic crisis in the country may have been to blame. American supporters watching on large screens in Washington, D.C. were, when it was announced Qatar had won, \"simply stunned\u2014no booing or tears, but disbelief; and then a minute later, every face shows honest disappointment,\" a BBC correspondent said.\nThe managing director for the Spain-Portugal joint bid, Miguel Angel Lopez, commented on losing out to Russia. \u201cFIFA thought it was better to promote football in other latitudes and there we are,\" he said. \"The decision is focused on taking football to regions which have never held a World Cup.\" Former Belgian footballer said: \u201cRussia is a political choice and Qatar is an economic choice. You can say that to some extent the sport has been the loser with the decision for these two World Cups.\u201d\n, Japan's bid chairman and CEO of Sony said: \u201cWe had it in 2002\u2014that was too big a mountain to climb. I was hoping we could get Japan another mission\u2014the chance to do something spectacular in technology for society.\u201d The vice-president of the Kuniya Daini added: \u201cWe had heard people say our bid was too soon so it\u2019s possible that was the reason. We knew it would be tough but it\u2019s still a big disappointment. We have set a target of hosting the World Cup alone by 2050 so we will be bidding again.\u201d The Australian Sports Minister told local media: \u201cWe\u2019re all pretty shattered over here. It was a bit unexpected because we thought we had run a first-class campaign to win. We did our best ... unfortunately it wasn\u2019t the case.\u201d \nMaking the announcement, Blatter said: \"We have had four bidders for 2018 and we can have only one winner. Three of the bidding associations must go home saying 'what a pity'. But they must say football is not only by winning but football is also a school of life where you learn to lose. That's not easy.\" The 2010 World Cup was held earlier this year in South Africa, and Brazil will host the . When the bids for the 2018 and 2022 tournaments were announced in March 2009, Blatter praised the number of countries who wanted to host. \"We are very pleased about the fantastic level of interest in our flagship competition, with all initial bidders confirming their candidature.\""}

The current government have decided not to activate this requirement and instead will only ask businesses to provide this data voluntarily and will set an \"aspiration\" to dramatically increase the number of women in senior positions in business.\n, the Liberal Democrat MP and coalition Equalities Minister, in announcing the plans stated that the government wishes \"to move away from the arrogant notion that government knows best, to one where government empowers individuals, businesses and communities to make change happen.\"\nFeatherstone announced the policy at the School of Management at , who have conducted research finding that only 12.5% of directors of FTSE 100 companies are women, up from 12.2% last year\u2014\"glacially slow\" progress according to business commentator David Prosser.\nFeatherstone justified not implementing the pay audits due to the economic costs: \"Right at this moment of financial peril to the nation is perhaps not the moment to introduce mandatory pay audits.\"\nThis breaks with a Liberal Democrat manifesto commitment, as well as contradicting Featherstone's own words two years ago in support of the audit: \"A voluntary audit system for private industry is hardly worth the paper it's printed on.

Dave Prentis, the general secretary of , Britain's second largest trade union, said that this is an example of the government \"stripping down its commitment to equality\".\nPrentis continued: \"It is a disgrace that women are still getting paid less than men. This move threatens to turn the clock back on all the progress already made with equal pay.\"\nCeri Goddard, the chief executive of the feminist campaigning group the , condemned the plans: \"The persistent gap in pay between men and women is one of the starkest examples of inequality in the UK today. The government's decision not to bring into force section 78 is a huge disappointment and means this injustice will continue for a long time to come. The government has today consigned another generation of women to lower pay. Their proposal to rely only on voluntary business action on pay isn't just naive, it sends a dangerous signal that tackling discrimination against women is a choice, not a requirement.\"\n, Featherstone's shadow minister on the Labour benches, called the news \"another broken promise from the government\" and said that \"scrapping Labour's plan to increase transparency in pay is a backwards step for women's equality.\""}

The policy has been the cause of protests across the United Kingdom by students, some of which have turned violent. It has also been a source of considerable criticism and political difficulties for the Liberal Democrats and has raised questions as to the long-term viability of the Coalition government.\nThe new policy on tuition fees will allow universities to double the current tuition fees from \u00a33,290 per year to around \u00a36,000 per year, as well as allowing some universities to get special approval from the Office For Fair Access (OFFA) to raise their fees to \u00a39,000 per year. If passed, the new fee structure will apply starting in the academic year of 2012/2013. The vote on Thursday will only be on the fee rise, with other matters being voted on in the new year following publication of a new higher education white paper.\nIn addition to increasing fees, the policy will increase the payment threshold at which payment is made. It is currently set at \u00a315,000 and will rise to \u00a321,000, but the interest rate will also rise. It is currently 1.5% but will now vary from between 0% and 3% plus inflation (using the Retail Price Index).\nThe fee increase follows the publication of an by Lord Browne, former chief executive of BP, a process started by Peter Mandelson, the former Business Secretary. Before the election, two main options were mooted for funding reform in higher education: either an increase in tuition fees or a . The Browne Review endorsed the former and the findings of the Review form the basis of the government's policy. The graduate tax was supported by the Liberal Democrats before the election, and in the Labour leadership elections it was supported by and the winner of the leadership election, .\nConservative members of the Coalition intend to vote for the reform, and the Labour opposition have been vociferous critics of the rise in fees, despite the previous government's introduction of top-up fees. The Liberal Democratic members of the Coalition have been left in a politically difficult position regarding the fee hike and have been target of much criticism from protesters. Liberal Democrats have opposed the rise in tuition fees: their party manifesto included a commitment to ending tuition fees within six years, and many signed a pledge organised by the to not vote for any increase in tuition fees.\nThe Coalition agreement allows Liberal Democrats to opt to abstain on votes for a number of policies including tuition fees. Many Liberal Democrats are expected to abstain, and a few MPs have stated that they will vote against it including former party leader Sir , and the recently elected party president , as well as a number of Liberal Democrat back-benchers. Liberal Democrat party leaders have said that they will act collectively, but the BBC have said senior Liberal Democrats have admitted in private that government whips will not be able to force all Liberal Democrats to vote for the policy.\nOn Tuesday, the Liberal Democrats parliamentary party will meet in the Commons to decide on their collective position. If all ministers decide to vote for the policy, it will probably pass, but if only cabinet ministers (and maybe parliamentary private secretaries) vote for the policy, there is considerable risk of it not passing. If the Coalition does not manage to get the policy through Parliament, it will fuel doubts about the continued effectiveness and viability of the government.\nHow deputy prime minister Nick Clegg and business secretary Vince Cable vote has been of considerable controversy. Although under the Coalition agreement, they are allowed to abstain, suggestions of doing so have prompted criticism. It was suggested last week that Cable may abstain even though as business secretary he is directly responsible for higher education policy, and has been heavily involved in designing the proposals. Cable has said that Liberal Democrat support of the tuition fee changes has allowed them to push it in a more \"progressive\" direction.\nCable has now decided that he will vote for the policy, and argues that the policy has \"a lot of protection for students from low income backgrounds and graduates who have a low income or take time out for family\". He also believes \"there's common consensus that the system we've devised is a progressive one\".\n\"Dr Cable has performed so many U-turns over the issue of university funding that he is spinning on his heels,\" said president . \"That may stand him in good stead with the \"\" judges but the electorate will see it differently.\"\nFormer deputy prime minister joked on Twitter that \"On tuition fees we've noticed Vince Cable's remarkable transformation in the last few weeks from stalling to Mr In Between\"\u2014a reference to a previous attack Prescott made on Gordon Brown as having transformed from \"Stalin to \".\nOn \"\" this week, Liberal Democrat treasury secretary also confirmed he is prepared to vote for the policy but delegated the question to the meeting of Liberal Democrats on Tuesday.\nThe politics of the tuition fee debate may also affect the by-election taking place in Oldham East and Saddleworth following the removal of , where Liberal Democrat and Conservative candidates will both be standing for the first by-election following the formation of the Coalition government.\nOpposition to the policy has become the focus for a large number of protests across the country by both current university students, many school pupils and political allies of the student movement.\nOn November 10, between 30,000 and 52,000 protesters from across Britain marched through central London in a demonstration organised by the and the , which represents teachers and lecturers in further and higher education. At the November 10 protest, a number of people occupied , an office block which houses the Conservative Party. Fifty people were arrested and fourteen were injured. NUS president Aaron Porter condemned the attack and said it was caused by \"those who are here to cause trouble\", and that the actions of a \"minority of idiots\" shouldn't \"undermine 50,000 who came to make a peaceful protest\".\nFollowing the November 10 march, other protests have taken place across the country including an occupation at the , a sit-in at the John Owens Building in Manchester, and a demonstration at the . A protest was also run outside the offices of \"\" where Nick Clegg\u2014who was giving a lecture inside the building\u2014was executed in effigy while students protested \"Nick Clegg, shame on you, shame on you for turning blue\" (blue is the colour of the Conservative Party).\nOn November 24, a large number of protests took place across the country including a mass walk-out from universities and schools organised on Facebook, numerous university occupations, and demonstrations in Manchester, Cambridge, Birmingham, Leeds, Brighton and Cardiff, and a well-publicised occupation of .\nIn London, a protest was planned to march down Whitehall to Parliament, but police held protesters in until they eventually broke free and ran around in a game of \"cat and mouse\" along the side streets around Charing Cross Road, Covent Garden and Picadilly Circus.\nSimon Hardy from the National Campaign Against Fees and Cuts described the police response including the controversial 'kettling' of protesters as \"absolutely outrageous\". Green MP raised the police response including the use of kettling in the House of Commons and stated that it was \"neither proportionate, nor, indeed, effective\".\nOn November 30, protests continued in London culminating in 146 arrests of protesters in Trafalgar Square, and protests in Cardiff, Cambridge, Newcastle, Bath, Leeds, Sheffield, Edinburgh, Liverpool, Belfast, Brighton, Manchester and Bristol. Protesters in Sheffield attempted to invade and occupy Nick Clegg's constituency office. Occupations of university buildings started or continued at University College London, Newcastle University, Cambridge University and Nottingham University, as well as council buildings in Oxford and Birmingham.\nA \"day of action\" is being planned on December 8, the day before the Commons vote, by the National Union of Students."}

Something of a covert military or military-industrial nature. Exactly what, and on what scale, remains to be determined,\" said McMullen, the reported cable author. He also admits that the number of North Koreans thought to be assisting the Burmese military \"is much higher than our best estimates of North Koreans in Burma.\" According to the in 2002, citing an unnamed U.S State Department official, the U.S. warned Burma not to pursue a nuclear program saying that it expects Burma \"to live up to its obligations [under the non-proliferation treaty] and to not pursue production of weapons grade fissile material.\" However a 2008 cable says that Burma may already be in possession of weapons grade uranium. The cable reports that a civilian tried to sell 2,000 kilograms of which \"could be dug up\" from the ground at a site in . Uranium-238 could be used in the construction of nuclear weapons.\n\"A Burmese civilian met with members of USDAO [United States Defense Attach\u00e9 Office] Rangoon and offered to sell Uranium-238. The individual had initially contacted the USDAO eight days prior with the offer. The individual provided a small bottle half-filled with metallic powder and a photocopied certificate of testing from a Chinese university dated 1992 as verification of the radioactive nature of the powder,\" said the cable. \"The individual claimed to be able to provide up to 2000 kg of uranium-bearing rock from a location in Kayah State, and further stated if the U.S. was not interested in purchasing the uranium, he and his associates would try to sell it to other countries, beginning with Thailand,\" it added. The cable adds that the Burmese government was unaware that such a transaction was taking place and that they \"would likely seize any additional samples or stocks of the material if aware of their existence.\" However, a cable in January of 2007 says that the Burmese military may have received a shipment of uranium at the end of that month. The \"sensitive shipment\" was said to have come from Singapore via shipping freighter.\n\"[An unnamed witness] claimed that metals are usually exported in blocks, whereas the bags in this shipment were filled with loose earth and mud. The source of the mixed ore, Maw Chi, is also a source for uranium, they claimed. Security was tighter than usual, surveillance was heavier, and officials paid closer attention to the movement of the shipment and activity at the port,\" said the cable. The cable author, 'Villarosa,' later states that the embassy in Rangoon was given allegedly detailed information on the shipping methods, weight and cost. No further cables have yet to be released on the matter."}

Adrian Tink, a motoring strategist for the , believes that the latter should be called off: \"It's unbelievable to think that, compared with this time last year, petrol is 13p a litre more expensive. That's over \u00a37 more every time you fill up an average tank.

Defense barrister Geoffrey Robertson said that Smith would keep Assange \"if not under house arrest, at least under mansion arrest.\" Assange's lawyers say that Assange is only wanted for questioning, and has not been charged with any crimes. However the lawyers representing Sweden countered by saying \"The court has already found that Mr. Assange is a flight risk. Nothing has changed in this regard. [If the alleged offences took place in Britain] it undoubtedly would have been a charge of rape in this jurisdiction.\" Robertson did not agree.\nBail was set at \u00a3200,000, with two additional guarantees of \u00a320,000. Assange would also have to surrender his passport and submit to electronic monitoring. Pending further court hearings, Assange will be residing in a manor owned by Smith, which is located near the Norfolk\u2013 border in England. Assange would also have to spend at least four hours at Smith's mansion in the day and four at night. He will also have to check in with police every day between 6\u20138 pm local time. After the magistrate outlined the conditions Assange said, emotionlessly, on Tuesday, \"I understand.\" Bail conditions remained the same, with small changes that included where he is allowed to travel, changes to his curfew and times in which he must report to authorities. Assange has yet to be formally charged with any crime.\nAssange believes the sex offense accusation against him are politically motivated to take attention away from material that Wikileaks is publishing, including the release of over 250,000 United States diplomatic cables."}

An investigation by the AFP into the release of the cables revealed that Wikileaks had not broken any laws under Australian jurisdiction.\n\"[The AFP has] not identified any criminal offences where Australia has jurisdiction and as a result have not commenced an investigation,\" said Robert McClelland, attorney-general of Australia in a statement to the press. \"As has previously been stated, given the documents published to date are classified by the United States, the primary jurisdiction for any investigation into the matter remains the United States.\"\nThe investigation into Wikileaks actions came after the Australian Government referred the release of U.S. diplomatic cables to the AFP.

He also added that the government remains \"concerned\" about the situation and \"unauthorised and irresponsible distribution of classified material.\"\nControversy had also been raised today after Julia Gillard changed her stance on the release of the cables from calling the action \"illegal,\" to calling it \"grossly irresponsible,\" after the AFP had released their findings. Ms Gillard said at a press-conference in Sydney today that she did not intend to say that the release of the cables was illegal, but that their theft was. Deputy leader of the opposition (Liberal Party) Julie Bishop said there was no room for Ms Gillard to \"weasel out of it.\"\n\"She is a lawyer.

Calls have also been voiced by the Green's Senator, Scott Ludlam, for Ms Gillard to retract her comments.\nWikileaks has been the subject of past investigations in Australia. In March of 2009, the proposed Australian Communications and Media Authority internet blacklist was leaked to the website. That matter was also referred to the AFP, who later abandoned pursuing criminal charges.\n\"It's my understanding from the AFP that they considered the prospects of success under their guidelines, but it wasn't sufficient to get a prosecution,\" said Chairman Chris Chapman during a Senate Estimates Committee meeting in February.

Shelley Armitage, 31, had been missing since April when police charged Griffiths; a piece of spine in the River Ayre was later identified as hers. Also found by the river was a suitcase containing knives and saws.\nIt was yesterday revealed her murder was also on video. Griffiths recorded the act on his mobile, which he then lost on a train. Its finder sold it on twice before police retrieved it, but the footage remained. Armitage is seen on cushions, the words \"My Sex Slave\" spray-painted in black on her back. She is also seen dead and naked in his bathtub. \"I am Ven Pariah, I am the Bloodbath Artist,\" Griffiths said as part of a commentary to the video. \"Here\u2019s a model who is assisting me.\"\nThe third murder - that of Susan Rushworth, 43 - dates back to June last year, when she vanished. Although police believe she was killed with a hammer and Griffiths has spoken of the death, no remains were ever found and the only physical evidence was one bloodstain in her killer's flat. Police found evidence he tried to clean up, with bathroom tiles removed and carpets lifted. \n\"It was just a slaughterhouse in the bathtub,\" he told police at interview. He later confessed to police that \"I, or part of me, is responsible for killing Susan Rushworth, Shelley Armitage and Suzanne Blamires, who I know as Amber.\" Two crossbows, crossbow bolts, and serial killer literature were seized from his flat.\nThe day before the final murder, Griffiths wrote on MySpace, using the Ven Pariah pseudonym, he had \"finally emerged into the world.\" He continued: \"What will this pseudo-human do, one wonders. Poor Stephen, pretended to be me, but he was only the wrapping. He knew towards the end, that I supplied the inner core of iron. Hatred Bound Tightly In Flesh. At very long last, the time has come to act out.\" He would later tell officers he was having a mental \"civil war\".\nHe told the magistrates' court on his first appearance his name was \"The Crossbow Cannibal.\" Yesterday, he was asked at merely to confirm his name, answering \"yes\". Each murder charge was read to him, and he answered \"guilty\" to each. Five security guards flanked him. He has also called himself the SF killer. Although he claimed to have boiled and eaten flesh from the first two victims and eaten the third raw, police could not verify this. ' says the suspect he invented it to increase his fame, but ' quotes \"\" as claiming police believed his cannibalistic claims.\nMr Justice Openshaw, the judge, yesterday called Griffiths \"wicked and monstrous.\" He told the court the killer's mental health had been investigated and there is \"no question that he [i]s fit to plead.\" He gave Griffiths the , meaning he will never be released.\nGriffiths has attempted suicide while in prison awaiting trial, and police have not yet established if he killed three more women, as he told officers his count stood at six.\nAt the time Griffiths was charged, Nicky Blamires, 54, has told the press her daughter Suzanne was a \"much-loved\" family member even though she \"went down the wrong path and did not have the life she was meant to have.\" \"Nobody deserves this,\" she said. \"All these girls were human beings and people's daughters.\"\nGriffiths was known as \"the lizard man\" in his block of flats owing to his habit of walking his two pet in the area. One neighbour is reported to have quoted him as saying he was studying for \"a PhD in murder and ,\" and he has spent time in a high-security psychiatric hospital.\nBritish media was quick to compare the case to , dubbed the \"Yorkshire Ripper\". Sutcliffe was a Bradford killer responsible for thirteen murders and seven attempted murders, including several prostitutes. Since his 1981 conviction he has spent most of the last three decades in high-security psychiatric hospital near London."}

The repeal, which was signed by Obama on Thursday, will now allow gay and lesbian service members to serve openly in the country's military, without fear that they will be discharged from service. A report by The Pentagon earlier this month concluded most U.S. service personnel do not believe reform of the rules on gays and lesbians serving in the military would affect morale, unit cohesion or military effectiveness. The report found only 30% believed that changing the law would have a negative effect. DADT, in effect for 17 years, was repealed by the United States Senate on Saturday. The military will cease enforcement of the policy in 60 days time, after the Pentagon has certified to Congress that it, and the military are ready to implement the new law.\n\"This is a very good day,\" Obama told a crowd of soldiers and senior military officials on Thursday. \"This morning I'm proud to sign a law that will bring an end to 'don't ask, don't tell'. No longer will tens of thousands of Americans be asked to live a lie in order to serve the country that they love.\" Obama added that the government would \"not drag their feet\" and they were \"committed to implementing this change swiftly and efficiently.\"\nCurrently, same-sex marriage is only legal in five of the 50 U.S. states; Connecticut, Iowa, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Vermont, including the District of Columbia (Washington D.C.). In 2008, same-sex marriage was banned in California after voters approved . It was later overturned by a federal judge in San Francisco who deemed the measure unconstitutional."}

Furthermore, the law requires all men between the ages 18 and 45 as well as all women between 18 to 35 to join the army if they are called upon. Those who fail to report for military service could be imprisoned for three years, and face fines. Those who deliberately inflict injury upon themselves to avoid could be imprisoned for up to five years, as well as fines. Civil servants, students, those serving prison terms, and those caring for an elderly parent are currently excluded from the draft, but they could be later called to serve. Totally exempt are members of religious orders, disabled persons, and married or divorced women with children.\nThe claims that the law was passed just before the new parliament convened in order to avoid scrutiny of the practice by the new parliament. However, laws surrounding forcible conscription are murky and it is unclear how tightly the new law would be enforced.\nThe new law has faced stiff criticism by Burmese around the world. Aung Kyaw Zaw, a military analyst on the China-Burma border, said that there are pros and cons to the new law. \"From the bad side, our country is already in deep poverty and the people barely have anything to eat. So [adopting such a law] may cause bigger negative effects on the country, which is already\u2026struggling to feed the current army and carry the burden of military expenses.\"\n\"On the plus side, civilians will learn how to use guns and be given a chance to understand the nature of the military. With the knowledge of how to handle weapons, the people will be able to rise up against the military \u2013 in a way they will be trained for the revolution.\"\nMany people see the draft as a threat to ethnic armed groups, who have been long embroiled in guerrilla conflicts with the government.\nBurma is a military dictatorship and already has a standing army close to half a million, one of the biggest per capita in the world. Previously, professionals, including doctors, engineers and mechanics, between the ages of 18 and 44, and females between 18 to 33, were required to serve in the military for up to three years. However, the new law extends this to five years in case of a national emergency."}

Centres in Newport and Glasgow were picketed by members Thursday and Friday mornings as part of a coordinated strike at seven of the thirty centres handling benefits and unemployment-related queries for the UK public.\n\"Wikinews\" spoke to Katrine Williams, one of the representatives of the (PCS), and a member of the Civil Service since 1991, to establish the grievances leading to the public-sector industrial action.\nBalloted in December, over 70% of PCS members voted in favour of strike action; according to Williams, this forced minor concessions from call centre management, but left staff being constantly monitored. With a target of five minutes or less to handle any query related to Job-Seekers' Allowance, staff have been threatened with disciplinary action should they take too long for calls. Williams expressed concern that, with many claimants, it took longer than this to simply establish what the issue was for a member of the public calling in.\nThe number provided for the public to call in relation to benefits is an 0845 number, usually charged at a local call rate when dialled from a landline within the UK; for many claimants, they may only have a mobile phone and be subject to higher charges, or even in a position where a benefit payment has been delayed, and this is their sole contact with the (DWP) when they may be in financial difficulty.\nBoth Williams and David Coventry, who spoke to the \"UK Press Association\", feel let down that their members' expertise is being dismissed; that what is the only option for the unemployed, and a public service, is being managed as-if a commercial enterprise. This, according to Williams, is the prevalent attitude for approximately ten years; managers previously in the private-sector constantly describe the service as a \"business\", and members of the public requiring assistance as \"customers\".\nIn describing negotiations with management to avert industrial action, Williams stated: \"contact centre managers are [the] worst [within the DWP]\", and they, \"renege on verbal agreements\".\nThe centres hit by strike action are: Bristol, Glasgow, Makerfield near Wigan, Manchester, Newport, Norwich, and Sheffield. Williams stated that a failure on the government's part to resolve the dispute could lead to further action involving the full 30 call centres operated by the DWP. In combination with threats of action by passport office staff in the PCS union, the UK's current coalition government may be faced with significant disruption to essential public services at a time when unemployment figures are climbing.\nWhen \"Wikinews\" contacted the DWP press office, only a prepared statement was available. Forwarded to \"Wikinews\" by Elise Simpson, the department expressed disappointment at industrial action being taken by staff, stating: \"only 21% across the centres\" were taking action. Appeals for further clarification, and answers to other queries were not returned. Considering the union selectively took action at seven of thirty centres, it would appear the walk-out at those was virtually all staff. Calls to the Jobseekers' 0845 number gave no indication calls may take longer to be connected to someone able to assist with a query or claim.\nIn late December, Brendan Barber of the warned that 2011 may be a year where the UK faces widespread public-sector industrial action. \u00a381 billion (US$128 billion) is set to be cut from the UK's expenditure, with the possible loss of over a quarter million public-sector jobs."}

Marius was found guilty of five counts of trafficking women into the UK for sexual exploitation, one count of conspiracy to traffic a woman into the UK for sexual exploitation, two counts of trafficking women within the UK for sexual exploitation, one count of trafficking a woman out of the UK for sexual exploitation, four counts of rape, five counts of assault, two counts of causing a woman to engage in sexual activity without consent, five counts of controlling prostitution for gain, and one count of witness intimidation to total 27 offences.\nThe duo join two others who admitted lesser roles in the scheme. Costel Maruntelu, 24, was previously jailed for five years and six months for sex trafficking crimes. Juanita \"Toni\" Huntingdon, 41, helped set up the Birmingham brothel and acted as a receptionist at both sites and entered guilty pleas to five counts of controlling prostitution for gain.

It reached its height of popularity during the late 19th century. The party heavily supported the , which banned the sale of alcohol, and resulted in the US period known as (1919\u201333). It was repealed in 1933. The party has declined since this period, but has continued to nominate candidates for the presidential election.\nIn 2003, the party split into two factions. Preacher and perennial candidate were nominated for the presidency by their respective factions. After Dodge's death in 2007, the party reunified and named Amondson as its sole presidential nominee for 2008. During the election, Amondson was interviewed by \"Wikinews\". He died in 2009, leaving an opening in the party for 2012.\nJim Hedges is a longtime activist, who holds the distinction of the first individual of the 21st century (and the first since 1959) to be elected to a political office under the Prohibition Party banner. In 2001, he was elected as the Thompson Township , and was re-elected to the post in 2005. He served until his term expired in 2010. Hedges declared his intent to run for the Prohibition Party presidential nomination on February 18, 2010. This marks his first run for the presidency.\nInterview.\n When and why did you decide to join the Prohibition Party?\nI have identified with the Prohibition Party since being in high school, in the 1950s. Being \"a member\" is trickier to specify, as I\u2019ve sometimes registered to vote in other parties for temporary pragmatic reasons (or have not been registered, at all). I could not be active in the Party until after I retired from the military, in 1980.\nWhy? Well, I liked, and still like, the Prohibition platform better than I do the platform of any other political group. Partly, this is because of the anti-alcohol plank, but more generally because it seems more principled and more reasonable.\n You are the first (and only) member of the Prohibition Party to be elected to any office in the 21st century. How were you able to accomplish such a feat?\nI ran for an insignificant local office which no one else wanted. Minor party people are always complaining that they can\u2019t get elected \u2013 they can, if they start at the beginning instead of aiming at impossible goals.\n According to the \"New York Times\", you were heavily involved in the 2004 split of the party that centered around five-time presidential nominee . What exactly caused the split, and has the party since healed?\nTo answer the last part first: It has largely healed. A few months after Dodge died, his hand-picked vice-chairman also died. The man who was third in line refused to carry on. That man, and the Dodge relatives, then dropped out completely; the other folks mostly are now working with the regular organization.\nThe split was caused by dissatisfaction with Dodge\u2019s management. Dodge was a somewhat paranoid person who trusted no one to help him. For example, he made one of his daughters \"treasurer\" of the Prohibition National Committee, but he did not allow her access to the bank account. He was the only \"signer\" listed on the check card. Another example: He used money from a bequest to purchase a small office condominium, then without telling even his vice-chairman, he mortgaged the condo, cashed it out, and after a time lost it (because the mortgage was not being paid); the vice-chairman discovered all this only after Dodge died. Dodge could sell the office condo undetected, because he held it in the name of a shell corporation controlled by himself and the said daughter.\n The late , the 2004 &amp; 2008 presidential nominee of the Prohibition Party was the national face of the party for a number of years. How well did you know Mr. Amondson, and what is the current state of the party with his absence?\nI met Amondson at a couple of conventions; otherwise, I knew him only from correspondence and from telephone calls. \nAmondson was a congenial person, warm and approachable. He was recommended to us by one of our supporters. He had an act, a re-creation of Rev. \u2019s sermon on booze, which he performed at conservative churches and other sympathetic venues. We hoped that his name recognition and the audience appeal of his act would enhance the Party\u2019s appeal.\nAs it turned out, he had a handicap, analogous to dyslexia, which prevented him from stringing words together into fluent sentences. His act was great. His public speaking and his writing were, um, unremarkable.\nWe miss his ability to attract attention to us.\n Mr. Amondson stated that \"Prohibition was America's greatest 13 years\" and that he would \"rather have 100 Al Capones in every city than alcohol sold in every grocery store\". Do you agree with these comments, and additionally, do you second his projection that \"Prohibition will come again for the fourth time\"? \nI expect that national prohibition will come again \"someday,\" because nothing we've tried since then has worked as well in reducing per-capita consumption of alcoholic beverages and the related social problems.\nThe rest of that is campaign hyperbole. \n Why did you choose to run for president and what are your qualifications?\nIt\u2019s partly a \"finger-in-the-dike\" tactic, because I see no one else in the organization who has the free time and the personal background needed to mount a plausible campaign. Partly, also, it\u2019s the realization that, at age 72, if I\u2019m ever going to do it, I\u2019d better get on with doing it now.\nMany times in the past, the Prohibition Party has recruited presidential candidates from outside its own ranks. The same may happen again this year. If not, I see myself as being the most broadly educated and widely experienced person within the core group of the Party. \nI have a in musical performance (, 1960) and served 20 years in one of our nation\u2019s most elite military units, The . \nI have a family-farm background, plus 20 years of life in the . I understand both rural and urban communities.\nI have an in Geography (, 1972), have published research in refereed journals both here and abroad, and for 11 years edited a journal. \nI have done volunteer work with and served as an officer of community organizations ranging from The to friends of the library to recycling programs to historical and literary clubs.\nI have done newspaper reporting, primarily on local government.\n Who are some of your opponents for the nomination and why do you believe you are a better choice for the party?\nTo my knowledge, no one else has yet expressed an interest in the Prohibition Party nomination.\n When and where will the party hold their convention, and how will a nominee be decided upon?\n, in June. See the National Committee's website for details. \nA vote of the credentialed delegates will determine who is the candidate.\n Do you agree with the decision to allow prominent to speak at the convention, despite his support for the sale of alcohol? \nYes. First of all, the Prohibition Party and the share some common interests, such as small government, balanced budgets, and personal freedoms. Secondly, we should all take time to listen to those who disagree with us, in order to sharpen our debating skills. Thirdly, we shouldn\u2019t be complacent, because... we might actually be wrong!\n According to the \"Ballot Access News\", the Prohibition Party has qualified for the ballot in only Florida. What will you do to gain ballot access in other states? \nMost likely, we will be able to meet the ballot requirements in only 2 or 3 states in addition to Florida (which has among the most lenient ballot access regulations today). Colorado is a likely one, as are Mississippi and Louisiana. \nFor small parties, the states where they run has very little to do with where they have the most support and very much to do with which states have the easiest regulations.\n What issues or policy stances form the basis of your campaign? \nInasmuch as beverage alcohol is our signature issue, I anticipate spending most of my time talking about the alcohol connection with various social problems: public safety, public health, taxes, homelessness, spouse abuse, child welfare, military preparedness, industrial efficiency, product quality, and so forth.\nThe platform most likely will address a lot of other things, but, let\u2019s face it: The Prohibition Party today is an exercise in living history. We\u2019re like the weekend warriors who put on costumes and . The South is not going to rise again. Neither is national prohibition going to come back (not, at least, in our lifetimes). But in both cases, we think there are important historical lessons which ought not be forgotten. And so, we soldier on against all odds.\nUnless we stay on the message (of alcohol), our living history lesson will be lost. \n Have you received any notable endorsements thus far?\nNo. Neither have I sought any. \n According to \"Weekend America\", Vice-Presidential nominee Leroy Pletten was incapacitated following a stroke during the 2008 campaign. Have you chosen a , and if not, will health be a factor in the decision?\nThe Public Radio announcement appears to be a case of mistaken identity. I have checked with Pletten, and no such thing happened.\nI\u2019ve been asking around. I know who I\u2019d like to have, but it\u2019s still under discussion.\nHealth should enter into it. We don\u2019t need another !\n How often do you campaign, and how might that change should you win the nomination? \nVery little campaigning, at this point. I sent out a series of monthly postcards last year, presenting myself to the people on the Party mailing list. There is also a (very rudimentary) campaign website \u2013 www.hedges4-12.com I\u2019m in touch with the people who will make the decision, at the Convention this coming June.\nIf I should receive the nomination, the website will have to be improved, and there will have to be press releases and some personal visits to states where we get on the ballot. I\u2019ll have to obtain advice on making more effective use of the internet. \n Describe a typical day for Jim Hedges. How do you spend your time?\nBefore going to sleep each evening, I map out the following day in my mind. Then, in the morning, I roll out (not too early), tend to personal care and a hearty breakfast, go to the other house (when my wife and I were married, 20 years ago, we each had a paid-for house, and it was convenient to keep both of them) and tend to the pets. The rest of the morning is spent dealing with paper mail and other clerical work. In warm weather, afternoons are devoted to yard work and to gardening; in cold weather, I do household maintenance chores, work in the shop, work on the wood pile. After supper, if there is not a rehearsal or a concert to go to, I practice half an hour on my tuba, then look at the internet or read.\nEvery day is different, but that\u2019s the basic schedule.\n What is your main source for political news? \nThree weekly newsmagazines: ', ', and . \n What is your biggest political concern at the moment? \nIn the next 10 years, eliminating governmental deficits, primarily in the United States and in Europe. In the next 100 years, dealing with the social and economic consequences of the rise in sea level due to .\n How would you assess the presidencies of George W. Bush and Barack Obama?\nBush the Younger was unquestionably the most damaging president since , perhaps the most damaging of all time: His \"\" and other security measures trashed the , our Constitution. His deficits have never been equaled. His foreign military adventures are the longest wars ever fought by our country. \nObama was dealt a miserable hand, but even so, I\u2019m becoming disappointed. We still have Bush\u2018s . We still have . We still have Bush\u2019s failure to secure . We still have Bush\u2019s . What is there to like?\nObama did end Bush\u2019s \",\" which attempted to prevent family planning agencies all over the world from even discussing abortion. And he did make a stab at improving medical care.\n What are your thoughts on Sarah Palin and the Tea Party Movement?\nPalin was for four years by the voters of Alaska. When she got bored with it, to and walked away. That\u2019s not responsible behavior.\nThe Tea Party folks are on the right track in trying to get the federal budget deficit under control. I fear, though, that they lack the patience and flexibility to do the job gracefully. And, they\u2019re too easily distracted by unrelated issues.\n What is your take on the the ?\nObamacare is a step in the right direction, but it leaves intact the private insurance industry, which is a major source of waste. We need a , like the one in England.\n What are some of your foreign policy views?\nAmerica first! Our unqualified is doing us a great deal of damage elsewhere in the world. We need to stop all aid, both civilian and military, to Israel until Israel abides by the .\nWe need to stop being the world\u2019s bully and, instead, lead by example: ratify , ratify , rein in the international corporations. \n What historical or contemporary figures do you identify with? \nYou know, I think it would be appropriate to name . I didn\u2019t always agree with what he did, but I could sympathize with why he did it. To the extent that any president can be, he was an honest, well-meaning person. \nLook at the things he has done since leaving the White House, then look at the things other presidents have done after their terms ended. Carter has continued to serve the American people, and the world, while the others have hie\u2019d themselves to their clubs and estates, to their lecture circuits and their corporate boards. \nYes, I would like to be a person such as Jimmy Carter."}

The demonstrators were protesting against the three-decade-rule of president Hosni Mubarak. Demonstrations turned violent in places, with police employing tear gas and rubber bullets while civilians hurled stones, burned tires, and even set fire to a government building. The newspaper says there were five deaths.\nReports say such massive protests have never been seen in the country before; they come two weeks after Tunisian president was overthrown by a popular revolt. Egyptian protestors, apparently inspired by the fall of Ben Ali, are demanding that Mubarak resign, complaining about unemployment, poverty, repression, and other issues.\nOver five hundred protestors were arrested during the skirmishes. Local media reports that at least fifty people have been wounded by the violence. According to media, however, there were somewhat fewer protestors on the second day of the rallies than the first, dubbed the \"Day of Wrath\" by anti-government supporters.\nEgypt's stock market reacted negatively to the clashes, going down by six percent on Wednesday, and the Egyptian pound reached a six-year low against the US dollar."}

He said there should be no requirement for Australians to contribute towards a levy, but rather the government should cut back on its own spending.\nGillard responded to Abbott's claims by saying that the Liberal's proposed paid maternity leave scheme would have required Australian people to pay a levy, and that it is unjustifiable that they then wouldn\u2019t allow for the rebuilding of Queensland.\nIndependent has said that until a designated fund for natural disaster relief is established by the Government, he will not approve of any relief levies introduced into parliament. , a fellow independent, agreed.

He is accused of involvement in the 2007 assassination of rival and ex-Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto while in power.\nCurrently in Dubai and residing in London, UK, Musharraf has been given until February 19 to appear before Rawalpindi's anti-terror court. If he does not, the court says it will declare him a wanted fugitive and the government has suggested Interpol could be called upon to assist with extradition.\nBhutto served from 1988\u20131990 and 1993\u20131996 as Prime Minister. In December 2007 her election motorcade was attacked using guns and a suicide bomb, killing her.

The attack came soon after.\nHer party, the , won a majority in the subsequent election and her widower, Asif Ali Zardari, is the current President. In 2008, Musharraf resigned under threat of impeachment. He had seized power from elected Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif in 1999 after a coup from his role as army chief. Growing dissatisfaction over both foreign and domestic policy led to demonstrations until he called the elections.\nThe ex-President's lawyer Mohammad Saif refuted the allegations. \"This is just a drama. It is all politics,\" he said, adding Musharraf was innocent and would not be appearing in court. The former dictator has not commented publically but denied involvement. \nHe has not been indicted and the court says Musharraf has the chance to defend himself as it conducts preliminary hearings on the claims. His position is that the accusations are a smear campaign led by Zardari. He blamed the for the attack at the time; they deny involvement but lead prosecutor Zulfikar Chaudhry said the Taliban was the source of information showing Musharraf was \"completely involved.\"\n\"A joint investigation team, in its report to the court, has found Musharraf guilty of being involved in the conspiracy,\" said Chaudhry, who is seeking a murder trial. No extradition treaty exists with Britain, but authorities there do decide on case-by-case requests.\nProsecutors contend he was fully aware of the plot in advance. They claim a questionaire was sent to his London home and multiple attempts were made to get in touch, to no avail. Now, investigators say, no further progress can be made without Musharraf."}

The number of riot police in the city \u2014 with body armor, armored vehicles, and water cannons \u2014 was anticipated by officials as high as 30,000, and estimated by organizers as high as 26,000.\nThe protest was organized by the National Co-ordination for Change and Democracy (CNCD), an umbrella group of Algerian organizations formed in late January. Protesters demanded democratic freedoms, an end to government corruption, and relief from economic hardships. Some protesters called for removal of President Bouteflika, although that was not a stated goal of the organizers.\nSeveral hundred protesters were arrested, at least briefly. Algerian activist Elias Felali, who blogged from within the demonstration, claimed the police wanted to provoke violence, but the protesters were pointedly non-violent."}

Assange has denied the claims of sexual abuse, claiming the allegations to be politically motivated because his website recently published secret US diplomatic cables. Earlier, during the hearing, Assange claimed that rape cases in Sweden were \"tried in secret behind closed doors in a flagrant denial of justice\", and termed the country \"the Saudi Arabia of feminism.\"\nJudge Howard Riddle, in his verdict, declared the allegations made by the two Swedish women a valid reason for extradition and also attested the validity of Sweden's demand to send Assange to the country for further questioning. \nGeoffrey Robertson QC, lawyer for Assange, suggested the latter could be extradited to the United States, on charges concerning the release of 250,000 US diplomatic cables by Wikileaks, where he could be sentenced to death penalty. His Swedish counterpart, Clare Montgomery QC, stated that while Assange's trial would be held in private, the arguments raised in the trial would be released to the public. She also assured that Sweden was going to provide \"protection\" against the alleged risk of Assange's extradition to the US, terming it as a \"threat and violation.\" The European Court of Human Rights has also agreed to intervene if Assange was subjected to an \"inhuman or degrading treatment or an unfair trial\" in the US, she added.\nAssange had been granted bail in December, but has been electronically monitored ever since.\nAssange has been accused of raping a sleeping woman, during his visit to Stockholm last year. Another woman has alleged that the Wikileaks founder sexual assaulted her thrice. If the Swedish court declares him guilty, he could be sentenced to up to four years in prison.\nPaul Stephens, the Australian ambassador to Sweden, had earlier written to the country's Justice Minister, appealing that if Assange was extradited, his hearing \"would proceed in accordance with due process and the provisions prescribed under Swedish law, as well as applicable European and international laws, including relevant human rights norms.\"\nAssange is likely to remain in custody, since bail is not granted in Sweden before a trial or the accused being released."}

The prosecution case was that Ward hit Wass with a brick, and no firearms allegation was made against Ward at trial, but both titles placed a photograph on their websites of Ward with a gun.\nThe papers took the image off their sites within hours, after being ordered to do so.

Angus McCullough QC represented Grieve, telling the court the \"strict liability\" provisions of the Contempt of Court Act 1981 had been breached.\nHigh Court judges Lord Justice Moses and Mr Justice Owen Thursday sided with Grieve and McCullough: \"We conclude that the nature of the photograph created a substantial risk of prejudicing any juror who saw that photograph against the defendant Ward.\"\nLord Justice Moses' judgment mentioned the significance of the case in regards to online publications: \"The criminal courts have been troubled by the dangers to the integrity and fairness of a criminal trial, where juries can obtain such easy access to the internet and to other forms of instant communication. Once information is published on the Internet, it is difficult if not impossible completely to remove it... This case demonstrates the need to recognise that instant news requires instant and effective protection for the integrity of a criminal trial.\"\n\"The Daily Mail\"'s website covered the ruling in an article in which they also offered an explanation for how they published the photograph. \"[A] journalist had submitted an article about the prosecution along with the photograph by e-mail, including a warning stating the handgun should not be included in any copy of the photograph as it would prejudice the trial,\" it reads. \"But when the story was put up online a freelance journalist, then working for the website, added the photograph without taking any legal advice.\"\nThe penalties for Associated Newspapers and News Group Newspapers will be considered by the judges later."}
