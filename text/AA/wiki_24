Pope Benedict XVI allowed Williamson back into the Roman Catholic church last Saturday. A few days before that, Swedish state television, SVT broadcast an interview in which Williamson said, \"I believe there were no gas chambers, yes.

He wrote: \"Amidst this tremendous media storm stirred up by imprudent remarks of mine on Swedish television, I beg of you to accept, only as is properly respectful, my sincere regrets for having caused to yourself and to the Holy Father so much unnecessary distress and problems,\" CNN reports.\nThe apology was followed by further problems when a fellow member of the Society was quoted in an Italian newspaper as saying he did not know if anyone had died in Nazi gas chambers. The Associated Press say that Father Floriano Abrahamowicz confirmed that the remarks, made to \"La Tribuna di Treviso\", were his.\nLast Wednesday, the Pope included a reference to Holocaust denial at the end of his weekly audience. Recently returned from a trip to the site of one of the camps, he said remembering the Holocaust \"induces humanity to reflect on the unpredictability of evil when it conquers the heart of man.

The date for the first hearing has been set for May 25, 2009.

The Church also faces charges of illegally operating as a pharmacy by illegally treating individuals with prescription medications.\nThe charges come from an unnamed woman, who in 1998 purchased nearly 140,000\u20a3 (US$30,000) worth of Scientology self-help material which allegedly included prescription drugs. After a few months passed, the woman said she felt like she was being scammed. \nFollowing several complaints from other unnamed individuals and an investigation, judge Jean-Christophe Hullin ordered the Church's 'Celebrity Center', and the seven managers to be put on trial for fraud and \"illegally practicing as pharmacists.\"\nOn September 8, 2008 the Church released a statement following the order to stand trial saying that they felt \"stigmatized\" by the French judicial system. \n\"The special treatment reserved for the Church of Scientology Celebrity Center raises questions about the equality of the justice system and the presumption of innocence,\" the Church said in a statement to the press.\nThis is not the first time the Church has been accused of fraud in France. They have also been convicted of it several times, including the Church's founder, L. Ron Hubbard who was convicted of fraud in 1978. In 1997 the Church was convicted of fraud in Lyon and 1999 in Marseille. The 1978 convictions included Hubbard and his wife at the time, Mary Sue, both now deceased, and two other Scientologists. \nThe 1978 convictions included Hubbard and four Scientologists after a seven year investigation into the Church by the French authorities. The court ruled that Hubbard and the others were using Scientology by making fraudulent claims that it was curing people from diseases to \"increase the financial revenue\" of the Church, and the ruling ordered Hubbard and the Scientologists to serve four years in prison. \nHowever, Hubbard, along with the four Scientologists fled France, never to return, and never served a prison term."}

If it is approved by the local parliament on February 9 it should be effective on April 26. The Swiss canton aims to stop spread of 'indecent practice' by minimally-clad German climbers.\nThe problem started with a group of \"boot-only hikers\" who were stopped by the police in the Alpine region last autumn. They had wandered there regularly, proudly marching through nature with bare bums, and had also advertised what they thought was a naked paradise on the internet. But it was all too much for the Swiss.\nA nude rambler dressed in nothing more than a rucksack and walking boots in the eastern Appenzell region was arrested and detained in the canton, but authorities were unable to file lawsuit because the act was not punished by law or ordinance at the time.\n\"We were forced to introduce the legislation against this indecent practice before the warm weather starts,\" Melchior Looser, the canton\u2019s justice and police minister, said. \u201cUltimately, in the summer lots of kids stay in our mountains,\u201d he added. \nIn the guidelines imposed, arrested offenders who cannot pay the fine, will face legal action. The new enabling ordinance has, however, been met with protests by nude hikers. \"We simply try to tune into nature. It's the most harmless pursuit possible,\" said Dietmar, age 58, a German lawyer. \nGerman tabloid Bild Zeitung has editorially attacked Swiss intolerance and even suggested nudist alternatives worldwide, after hinting a Swiss tourism boycott. Local authorities of Harz mountain range in central Germany have also announced the openness to any visitor of an \u201cofficial naked walking route\u201d in nature's outdoors. \nFreik\u00f6rperkultur (\"FKK\"), or \"free body culture\", is a popular pastime in Germany. It is a German movement which endorses a naturistic approach to sports and community living. Behind that is the joy of the experience of nature or also on being nude itself, without direct relationship to sexuality. The followers of this culture are called traditional naturists, FKK'ler, or nudists. \nThe naked ramblers have hoped it doesn't lead to another naturist-clothed 'war', like the one at a beach between German and Polish holidaymakers in 2008. Naturism has roots traced from the start of the 20th century. \"Abandoning unpractical clothes enables a direct contact with the wind, sun and temperature\", naked hiker website nacktwandern.de stated.\nBut Markus D\u00f6rig, a spokesman for Appenzell Innerrhoden canton has defended the law, explaining that the \u201cpublic nuisance\u201d was a foreign import. \u201cWe have been receiving many complaints. The local people are upset and we in the government share their concern. How would one feel if one was to go walking in nature and suddenly came across a group of naked people? They are definitely not people from the area, and I think many of them come from Germany,\u201d he noted. \n\u201cWe are a small and orderly community and such things are simply out of place here. Perhaps in vast mountain areas naked people would not be much of a problem but here they simply stick out,\u201d D\u00f6rig added. \"I can understand that we all have to live in this world together,\" said Barbara Foley, International Naturist Foundation member of the central committee. \"But I would certainly enjoy doing the hike in the nude and I wouldn't want to be deprived of it. It's nice to feel the sun on your skin. Maybe they should designate a couple of trails and people would know they might come across naturists there,\" she added.\nAppenzell Innerrhoden (Appenzell Inner Rhodes) is the smallest canton of Switzerland by population and the second smallest by area, Basel-City having less area. The population of the canton was 15,471 as of 2007, of which 1,510 (or 9.76%) were foreigners. The canton in the north east of Switzerland has an area is 173\u00a0km\u00b2. It was divided in 1597 for religious reasons from the former canton Appenzell, with Appenzell Ausserrhoden being the other half.\nAppenzell is the capital of this canton. The constitution was established in 1872. Most of the canton is pastoral, this despite being mountainous. Cattle breeding and dairy farming are the main agricultural activities: Appenzeller cheese is widely available throughout Switzerland. Due to the split of Appenzell along religious lines, the population (as of 2000) is nearly all Roman Catholic (81%), with a small Protestant minority (10%). \nThe town, however is far from liberalism: the canton granted women the right of suffrage only in 1990 under pressure from the Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland and international human rights groups. The Alpine village of Appenzell Innerrhoden, being known for its beautiful landscape, has recently been declared a \"naked rambler paradise\" by a German mountaineering website, which was created by a lobby group of hikers."}

Three mortar shells (or four flash bombs) are reported to have fallen near a polling station in Tikrit, but without causing injuries. A civilian and six policemen were injured by a bomb in Tuz Khurmatu, north of the capital Baghdad.\nThere are more than 14,000 people standing in 14 of Iraq's 18 provinces, with 440 seats up for election. The three Kurdish-controlled provinces are not voting and the election in Kirkuk province has been postponed. Provincial councils in the country have a large workforce, meaning that changes of control lead to changes in workforce. This gives winning candidates a lot of power in their local area. The U.S. Central Intelligence Agency estimated that unemployment rates in the country were between 18% and 30% in 2006.\nAnalysts have said that voters are likely to turn away from religious parties and focus instead on nationalist and secular issues. In previous elections, the Sunni minority in the country had boycotted the polls. Reports say that they are turning out this time, with high turnouts in Sunni-dominated provinces like Anbar, and voting has been extended by an hour to allow more time.\nIraq was a one-party state following a revolution in 1968. Former dictator Saddam Hussein came to power in an internal coup in 1979. He was removed from power in 2003 following the controversial American-led invasion of the country. After the invasion, the economy and civil structure of the country collapsed but now appears to be stabilising, with more areas being returned to local control and plans by new U.S. President Barack Obama for American troops to withdraw."}

Read below for more of the interview in full.\nInterview.\nFor our readers who are unaware of your site, could you briefly explain what wikiHow is?\nJack Herrick: Sure. wikiHow is a collaborative effort to build the world's largest, highest quality how-to manual. Our long term goal is to produce practical instructions on almost every topic in every language. We're quite far from our goals currently, but we take comfort in the fact that every month wikiHow gets noticeably better and larger. We currently have just under 50,000 articles [Note: The interview took place just before the 50,000 milestone was met] and over 1,000 featured articles. We hope that in time, we will have millions of articles with many of them having featured status. That said, we are realistic enough to realize that this goal will take decades to achieve. However, in terms of readership, we are probably the most popular single subject wiki after Wikipedia. We get over 14 million unique visitors per month (source:Google Analytics), which makes us the 135th most popular site according to Quantcast. \nLike Wikipedia, wikiHow is a wiki that runs on Mediawiki software. Our community is full of volunteers from all over the world. That said, we are quite different from Wikipedia in several respects:\nWhy did you decide to create wikiHow?\nJH: I think that providing people with a practical education is one of the most empowering things you can offer a person. Imagine having detailed step-by-step instructions on how to do any activity you could imagine. How much more could you accomplish as an individual if you could learn any activity? I think that building a universal how-to manual would be a tremendous gift for the world. Knowledge is power and wikiHow has the potential to make all of us a bit more powerful.\nI've been interested in building a comprehensive how-to manual long before I first envisioned wikiHow. My first attempt at building this resource was a website I used to run called eHow. eHow was and continues to be the largest and how to website in the world. eHow contains copyrighted content run on proprietary software. When I ran eHow, the content was professionally produced and edited. This business model worked for producing content on topics that appeal to advertisers in languages like English that have large advertising markets. However, paying people to write and edit articles ultimately means that you have to make one of two sacrifices. You either 1) sacrifice on breadth and don't produce the topics that won't interest advertisers, or 2) you sacrifice on quality and produce content that doesn't cost much to write. I wasn't interested in making either of these sacrifices, as I think the world's how to manual needs to be high quality AND comprehensive. So ultimately I decided that eHow's model would not build the resource I envisioned. When I discovered Wikipedia, I recognized that the wiki model had the potential to build the how-to resource the world really needs. So I decided to sell eHow and use the proceeds to build wikiHow.\nWhy did you decide to use a Creative Commons license?\nJH: We use a Creative Commons license to give our community the right to fork (http://www.wikihow.com/wikiHow:Right-to-Fork). In my opinion, people should be hesitant to contribute to websites where you only have the \"right to leave.\" If wikiHow volunteers think our site is going in the wrong direction, they can take all the content and all the software and move the project elsewhere. This is possible because we release all of our software under the Open Source GPL license and release our content under a Creative Commons license. This right to fork guarantees that wikiHow, the company, will always serve the goal of the mission and our volunteer community. I believe that offering this right to fork has been a key element of our success thus far. My hope is that over time, internet users will demand this of any site where they invest their time in a way that creates value for others.\nThat said, when we started out I didn't know the difference between the GNU Free Document License and my California Driver's license. As a result, we made some mistakes along the path. In retrospect, I think we probably should have selected the CC BY-SA license instead of CC-BY-SA-NC. At a minimum this would provide a helpful compatibility with other wikis and free culture projects.\nwikiHow now has millions of visitors per month. How did you grow the site to the size it is today?\nJH: In December 2008, wikiHow had over 14 million unique visitors according to Google Analytics (Full data: http://www.wikihow.com/wikiHow:Statistics). Quantcast ranks wikiHow as the 135th most popular site in the US. (http://www.quantcast.com/wikihow.com). wikiHow achieved this popularity for a few reasons. First, people around the world are desperate for high quality how-to information. People want to learn more practical skills, and for the most part the internet doesn't provide enough quality information yet. Second, we attracted millions of readers via the virtuous circle of wiki editing: We had some articles of mixed quality, and editors joined to improve those articles, which in turn attracted more readers. We continue to depend on this same virtuous cycle: More readers, means more editors, which creates better instructions, leading again to more readers. It is the same virtuous circle that Wikipedia has enjoyed."}

The EU is expecting an application if the Social Democratic Alliance wins May's general election in the country.\nThe next entrant to the union is to be Croatia. It has been rapidly making changes to its government and economy in order to join in 2011. The EU will then have 28 members. Iceland could join at the same time, making 29.\nIceland could join quickly because it is already a member of the European Economic Area and therefore already complies with many EU directives. The main contention would be Iceland's rich fishing waters, which are contested by several nearby fishing countries. Iceland and the United Kingdom fought short naval wars in the 1950s and 1970s over the issue of fishing rights in the area. There is also an issue with Ireland's failure to ratify the Treaty of Lisbon, which was designed to streamline the union as more countries join. Without the unanimous ratification, further expansion is difficult.\nThe EU has its roots in the six member European Coal and Steel Community, founded by France and then-West Germany in 1951. In 1957, the members of the Community formed the European Economic Community (EEC), a common market and customs union. The coal and steel organization was merged into the EEC in 1967. In 1993, the EEC became the European Union. The EU adopted a central banking system and single currency, the Euro, between 1999 and 2002.\nThe Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Turkey are all on the waiting list for entry to the EU."}

Currently Queensland runs on Australian Eastern Standard Time (UTC+10).\n__NoTOC__\nInterview.\nWhy have daylight saving in only part of the state instead of the whole state?\nDaylight Saving in Queensland appears to be a geographical issue. The results of the 1992 Referendum show that the concept was favoured by 51 (out of 89) electorates, all of which were located in the South East Queensland Region. In 2007, the Queensland Government commissioned AC Nielsen to undertake research. The results of this research indicated that 69% of respondants in the South East Queensland region were in favour of Daylight Saving, with only 20% opposed. This research also indicated that 59% of respondants outside of the South East region were opposed to Daylight Saving being introduced into their region. Overall those opposed to daylight saving in Queensland has decreased from 54.5% in 1992 to only 34% against, according to the Nielsen findings. South East Queensland businesses are also overwhelmingly in favour of having Daylight Saving introduced into the region.\nAs Daylight Saving is not favoured outside of the South East Queensland region, DS4SEQ believe that a dual time zone is a compromise that respects the needs of regional and rural Queenslanders, while also giving fair consideration to the view of the majority of residents in South East Queensland. \nWhat benefits would daylight saving have for South East Queensland?\nBy moving the time of the clock against the natural occurring solar movement, Daylight Saving provides allowance for an hour less sunlight in the very early morning, when about 80% of people are sleeping, and provide an hour more sunlight in the evening, which can the be utilised. Benefits that can be gained from the introduction of daylight saving into South East Queensland are:\nHow soon would you like to see a referendum on the issue of daylight saving?\nDS4SEQ are not advocating a referendum. DS4SEQ's political goal is to convince the major parties to change their thinking about Daylight Saving in Queensland, to adapt to Queensland's changing landscape and \"It's About Time!\" that serious consideration was given to our dual time zone concept.\nWhat questions would you like see on the ballot paper for said referendum?\nAs per the previous question, DS4SEQ are not advocating a referendum, but seeking a revised policy on Daylight Saving in Queensland, by both major parties, to seriously consider a dual time zone arrangement for 6 months of the year.\nWill DS4SEQ keep campaigning for daylight saving in South East Queensland if you don't get any seats in parliament?\nThe current stance taken by both major parties, in relation to Daylight Saving in Queensland, is outdated, out of touch and inflexible. South East Queenslanders are frustrated that neither major party is currently prepared to explore options on the issue of Daylight Saving.\nWhilst DS4SEQ is aiming to win seats in the Queensland Parliament, we believe that gaining a sizeable percentage of the primary vote will send the key message to the major parties that they can no longer ignore: When it comes to the issue of Daylight Saving, the people of South East Queensland have been ignored for too long, and a dual time zone arrangement must be implemented.\nWith a sizeable percentage of the vote achieved, DS4SEQ will be able to lobby the Government and Opposition, with evidence that constituents are demanding Daylight Saving to be implemented within the South East Queensland region."}

He is healthy and home with his parents in Daly City, California. Polydactyly, a congenital disorder is not uncommon in humans and animals, including cats, but to happen on both hands and feet is a rare hereditary condition. \n\"Nurses and doctors, looked so normal they couldn't tell, they told me he was six pounds in good health, that was all they said,\" said Miryoki Gross, Hubbard\u2019s mother. Her baby's specialness didn't even show up on prenatal ultrasounds. \"I heard nothing before I gave birth so I'm still in shock, kinda,\" Gross added. Despite the mother's shock, Kamani's father, Kris, was the first to notice the condition.\nPolydactyly (from Ancient Greek means '\u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03cd\u03c2' (polus) or \"many\" + '\u03b4\u03ac\u03ba\u03c4\u03c5\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2' (daktulos) \"finger[s]\"), also known as polydactylism, sexdactyly, hexadactyly, or hexadactylism, is a congenital physical disorder consisting of supernumerary fingers or toes.\nIn Kamani's case, however, all of the digits are perfectly formed and function or work normally. \"I was in amazement, it took a little time for me to take it all in,\" said Kris, a postal worker, who has a family history of polydactylism, but none of his relatives can remember it happening on both hands and feet. \nMostly, cases of polydactyly are surgically corrected. Kris himself had nubs of sixth digits, which were removed during his early childhood, for having been non-functional. \"My son has six fingers then I saw toes, and I thought, this is quite unique. Some family members have had six fingers, not completely developed. But not the toes,\" Kris noted.\n\"I would be tempted to leave those fingers in place. I realize children would tease each other over the slightest things, and having extra digits on each hand is more than slight. But imagine what sort of a pianist a 12-fingered person would be imagine what sort of a flamenco guitarist, if nothing else think of their typing skills,\" Dr. Treece remarked.\n\"I just want him to see what greatness will be in store for him,\" said Kris. \nFully developed and functional extra digits on both hands and feet are considered very rare as a genetic trait in medical history, amid some partial development of an extra digit occurs about twice in every 1,000 white male births. Ordinarily, polydactylism appears as an extra piece of non-functional tissue, typically occurring as an extra finger, sometimes with a bone, but no joint.\n\"It's merely an interesting and beautiful variation rather than a worrisome thing,\" said Dr. Michael Treece, a St. Luke's Hospital pediatrician, and the OBGYN who delivered Kamani. He has postaxial polydactyly, which is 10 times more likely to occur in black children, and also more likely to appear in boys.\nGoliath, a figure in Old Testament, was depicted as having had six fingers on each hand and six toes on each foot. \nBlues guitarist Hound Dog Taylor, Get Carter, Little Tich, Toyotomi Hideyoshi and several other figures in history have had polydactyly. Sid Wilson, a turntablist of Slipknot, had been born with an extra finger and toe on his hands and feet which were removed shortly after his birth as doctors considered them to be dead."}

Workers on industrial sites in Wales, Scotland, Cheshire, Hampshire and Teesside had left their plants and staged protests outside in sympathy with staff at Lindsey Oil Refinery in Lincolnshire, after French owner Total had given a contract to an Italian firm. The firm brought 300 Italian and Portuguese staff into the plant.\nBrown had made a speech in 2007 where he called for \"British jobs for British workers\". He explained to the BBC's Politics Show that \"when I talked about British jobs, I was taking about giving people in Britain the skills, so that they have the ability to get jobs which were at present going to people from abroad\". The government says that European Union (EU) law makes it impossible for them to provide British jobs for British workers in the EU common market. Earlier, the Secretary of State for Health, Alan Johnson, told the BBC that recent European Court of Justice judgments had undermined employment rights but that the government would be pushing the EU to take action if it finds that the foreign workers are 'undercutting' UK citizens. He described the walkouts as \"unhelpful\", but said he understood the anger over EU workers coming to the UK \"on worse terms and conditions to actually get jobs in front of British workers on the basis of dumbing down the terms and conditions.\" \nThe walkouts were also condemned by the opposition Conservative Party. Foreign affairs spokesman William Hague said that \"strikes are never the way forward\" and that his party strongly supported the free market in labour in the EU. He said that it was \"so unbelievably ridiculous and silly\" for Brown to have made the promise on British jobs in the first place.\nThe government has asked the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service (ACAS) to examine the circumstances behind the strikes and see if British workers are being unlawfully excluded, as the GMB union has claimed.\nSecondary or sympathetic industrial action has been illegal in the UK since the 1980s. However, the penalties apply only to unions organizing secondary action and not to individual workers walking out."}

Stanford University physicists have claimed to have written the letters \"SU\" at sub-atomic size.\nGraduate students Christopher Moon, Laila Mattos, Brian Foster and Gabriel Zeltzer, under the direction of assistant professor of physics Hari Manoharan, have produced the world's smallest lettering, which is approximately 1.5 nanometres tall, using a molecular projector, called Scanning Tunneling Microscope (STM) to push individual carbon monoxide molecules on a copper or silver sheet surface, based on interference of electron energy states. \nA nanometre (Greek: \u03bd\u03ac\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2, nanos, \"dwarf\"; \u03bc\u03b5\u03c4\u03c1\u03ce, metr\u03cc, \"count\") is a unit of length in the metric system, equal to one billionth of a metre (i.e., 10-9 m or one millionth of a millimetre), and also equals ten \u00c5ngstr\u00f6m, an internationally recognized non-SI unit of length. It is often associated with the field of nanotechnology.\n\"We miniaturised their size so drastically that we ended up with the smallest writing in history,\" said Manoharan. \"S\" and \"U,\" the two letters in honor of their employer have been reduced so tiny in nanoimprint that if used to print out 32 volumes of an Encyclopedia, 2,000 times, the contents would easily fit on a pinhead.\nIn the world of downsizing, nanoscribes Manoharan and Moon have proven that information, if reduced in size smaller than an atom, can be stored in more compact form than previously thought. In computing jargon, small sizing results to greater speed and better computer data storage. \n\"Writing really small has a long history. We wondered: What are the limits? How far can you go? Because materials are made of atoms, it was always believed that if you continue scaling down, you'd end up at that fundamental limit. You'd hit a wall,\" said Manoharan.\nIn writing the letters, the Stanford team utilized an electron's unique feature of \"pinball table for electrons\" \u2014 its ability to bounce between different quantum states. In the vibration-proof basement lab of Stanford's Varian Physics Building, the physicists used a Scanning tunneling microscope in encoding the \"S\" and \"U\" within the patterns formed by the electron's activity, called wave function, arranging carbon monoxide molecules in a very specific pattern on a copper or silver sheet surface. \n\"Imagine [the copper as] a very shallow pool of water into which we put some rocks [the carbon monoxide molecules]. The water waves scatter and interfere off the rocks, making well defined standing wave patterns,\" Manoharan noted. If the \"rocks\" are placed just right, then the shapes of the waves will form any letters in the alphabet, the researchers said. They used the quantum properties of electrons, rather than photons, as their source of illumination. \nAccording to the study, the atoms were ordered in a circular fashion, with a hole in the middle. A flow of electrons was thereafter fired at the copper support, which resulted into a ripple effect in between the existing atoms. These were pushed aside, and a holographic projection of the letters \"SU\" became visible in the space between them. \"What we did is show that the atom is not the limit \u2014 that you can go below that,\" Manoharan said. \n\"It's difficult to properly express the size of their stacked S and U, but the equivalent would be 0.3 nanometres. This is sufficiently small that you could copy out the Encyclopaedia Britannica on the head of a pin not just once, but thousands of times over,\" Manoharan and his nanohologram collaborator Christopher Moon explained.\nThe team has also shown the salient features of the holographic principle, a property of quantum gravity theories which resolves the black hole information paradox within string theory. They stacked \"S\" and the \"U\" - two layers, or pages, of information \u2014 within the hologram. \nThe team stressed their discovery was concentrating electrons in space, in essence, a wire, hoping such a structure could be used to wire together a super-fast quantum computer in the future. In essence, \"these electron patterns can act as holograms, that pack information into subatomic spaces, which could one day lead to unlimited information storage,\" the study states.\nThe \"Conclusion\" of the Stanford article goes as follows:\nThe team is not the first to design or print small letters, as attempts have been made since as early as 1960. In December 1959, Nobel Prize-winning physicist Richard Feynman, who delivered his now-legendary lecture entitled \"There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom,\" promised new opportunities for those who \"thought small.\" \nFeynman was an American physicist known for the path integral formulation of quantum mechanics, the theory of quantum electrodynamics and the physics of the superfluidity of supercooled liquid helium, as well as work in particle physics (he proposed the parton model).\nFeynman offered two challenges at the annual meeting of the American Physical Society, held that year in Caltech, offering a $1000 prize to the first person to solve each of them. Both challenges involved nanotechnology, and the first prize was won by William McLellan, who solved the first. The first problem required someone to build a working electric motor that would fit inside a cube 1/64 inches on each side. McLellan achieved this feat by November 1960 with his 250-microgram 2000-rpm motor consisting of 13 separate parts.\nIn 1985, the prize for the second challenge was claimed by Stanford Tom Newman, who, working with electrical engineering professor Fabian Pease, used electron lithography. He wrote or engraved the first page of Charles Dickens' \"A Tale of Two Cities\", at the required scale, on the head of a pin, with a beam of electrons. The main problem he had before he could claim the prize was finding the text after he had written it; the head of the pin was a huge empty space compared with the text inscribed on it. Such small print could only be read with an electron microscope. \nIn 1989, however, Stanford lost its record, when Donald Eigler and Erhard Schweizer, scientists at IBM's Almaden Research Center in San Jose were the first to position or manipulate 35 individual atoms of xenon one at a time to form the letters I, B and M using a STM. The atoms were pushed on the surface of the nickel to create letters 5nm tall.\nIn 1991, Japanese researchers managed to chisel 1.5 nm-tall characters onto a molybdenum disulphide crystal, using the same STM method. Hitachi, at that time, set the record for the smallest microscopic calligraphy ever designed. The Stanford effort failed to surpass the feat, but it, however, introduced a novel technique. Having equaled Hitachi's record, the Stanford team went a step further. They used a holographic variation on the IBM technique, for instead of fixing the letters onto a support, the new method created them holographically. \nIn the scientific breakthrough, the Stanford team has now claimed they have written the smallest letters ever - assembled from subatomic-sized bits as small as 0.3 nanometers, or roughly one third of a billionth of a meter. The new super-mini letters created are 40 times smaller than the original effort and more than four times smaller than the IBM initials, states the paper \"Quantum holographic encoding in a two-dimensional electron gas,\" published online in the journal Nature Nanotechnology. The new sub-atomic size letters are around a third of the size of the atomic ones created by Eigler and Schweizer at IBM.\nA subatomic particle is an elementary or composite particle smaller than an atom. Particle physics and nuclear physics are concerned with the study of these particles, their interactions, and non-atomic matter. Subatomic particles include the atomic constituents electrons, protons, and neutrons. Protons and neutrons are composite particles, consisting of quarks.\n\"Everyone can look around and see the growing amount of information we deal with on a daily basis. All that knowledge is out there. For society to move forward, we need a better way to process it, and store it more densely,\" Manoharan said. \"Although these projections are stable \u2014 they'll last as long as none of the carbon dioxide molecules move \u2014 this technique is unlikely to revolutionize storage, as it's currently a bit too challenging to determine and create the appropriate pattern of molecules to create a desired hologram,\" the authors cautioned. Nevertheless, they suggest that \"the practical limits of both the technique and the data density it enables merit further research.\" \nIn 2000, it was Hari Manoharan, Christopher Lutz and Donald Eigler who first experimentally observed quantum mirage at the IBM Almaden Research Center in San Jose, California. In physics, a quantum mirage is a peculiar result in quantum chaos. Their study in a paper published in Nature, states they demonstrated that the Kondo resonance signature of a magnetic adatom located at one focus of an elliptically shaped quantum corral could be projected to, and made large at the other focus of the corral.

The bank's financial strength was also downgraded from \"C\" to \"B\". Last week, another agency, Fitch, downgraded the bank one step to \"AA-minus\".\nBarclays is one of the few major \"High Street\" banks in the UK not to have taken any government capital support. The support is given in return for shares, giving the government significant - sometimes even controlling - stakes in other banks, such as Lloyds Banking Group and the Royal Bank of Scotland Group.\nMoody's said that the downgrades \"reflect [our] expectation of potentially significant further losses at Barclays as a result of write-downs on credit market exposures as well as an increase in impairments in the UK, which could weaken profitability and capital ratios... [we consider] the systemic importance of the bank and the likelihood of receiving government support in case of need to be high.\"\nThe bank has forecast a pre-tax profit of \u00a35.3 billion for 2008. It has \u00a336 billion in committed capital equity and expects gross write downs of \u00a38 billion.

That simple message was wrapped with success; she became the first German in Contest history to take home the grand prize. The song was a brainchild of her former record producer, Ralph Siegel, and would be their greatest achievement in their nearly three-decade partnership.\nAfterward, she was propelled to stardom across Europe by recording versions of her winning song, \"Ein bi\u00dfchen Frieden\" (\"A little peace\"), in many European languages. To this day, it was the last winning Eurovision song to top the charts in the United Kingdom; it also has the distinction of being the 500th #1 single on the British charts.\nThis newfound fame brought her music to audiences across Europe, and in time, into Asia as well. By the end of the 1980s, however, her fame subsided somewhat and she refocused her career domestically. Since 1980, she has released over 30 albums in Germany; her most recent offering, \"Mitten ins Herz\" (\"Right into your heart\"), was accompanied by a three-month \"unplugged\" tour that ended in the third week of January.\nNow off the road, Nicole spoke with \"Wikinews'\" about her past success, her life and career today, and her overall impressions of the Eurovision Song Contest, both past and present. This is the first in a series of interviews with past Eurovision contestants, which will be published sporadically in the lead-up to mid-May's next contest in Moscow.\nEarly career.\n You started out performing at the age of 6. Was this an interest you really wanted to pursue at such a young age? Did you ever feel pressured by your family in any way to succeed musically, or were they very supportive?\nNicole: Actually, I started out performing at the age of 4. When I got my first applause, it was clear to me what my profession would be, and my family gave me the utmost support.\n When did you start to consider music as a full-time career?\nNicole: At the age of 16, after the great success I had with my first record, \"Flieg nicht so hoch, mein kleiner Freund\" (\"Don't fly so high, my little friend\").\n You started your partnership with Ralph Siegel back when you were 16. How did he decide to give you a record contract? Did you have any doubts about signing it?\nNicole: He was the first one who believed in me after hearing my voice and I had no doubt that he was the right person for a [musical] partnership.\nEurovision '82 and mainstream success.\n Did any of your inspirations and goals change when you signed your record contract, or appeared in Eurovision?\nNicole: I was trying to find my own way. After I signed my record contract everything changed. Especially after winning the Eurovision Song Contest. \n Were you ever torn about eventually putting your singing over your guitar skills?\nNicole: I liked playing the guitar in \"Ein bi\u00dfchen Frieden\". It was a good combination, wasn't it? Afterwards I put the guitar \"into the corner\" so I could be more mobile on stage.\n The bookmakers Ladbrokes had the United Kingdom as the favorite to win back in 1982. Going into the Contest, especially knowing that Germany hadn't won at that point, did you feel daunted?\nNicole: I expected to win. After the first rehearsal, everybody could feel the magic of the song and its message. It was \"my\" song!\n Many of the songs and performers who performed for Germany before you performed sweeping ballads, with dramatic melodies, in sometimes very showy performances. And here you come in, a young girl from the Saarland, guitar in hand, singing a modest offering, asking for peace. Do you feel the lack of complexity in the song and performance perhaps gave it a special kind of appeal?\nNicole: I was honest in everything [I said] and sang what the people were thinking at that time. Asking for peace was also in their minds.\n During the 1980s, you had a string of hits in Germany, and released singles and albums across Europe and into Asia as well. Whose idea was it to give you exposure in Asia?\nNicole: It was the idea of the record company and Ralph Siegel.\n Did you have pleasant experiences doing promotional tours over there? What thing do you remember most fondly?\nNicole: We went to the Tokyo Yamaha Festival and won second place there with \"So viele Lieder sind in mir\" (\"There are so many songs inside me\"). I learned to introduce myself [to people] in Japanese. That's what I remember fondly and I haven't forgotten one word to this day.\n You've continued to release albums nearly every year since the early 1980s, but a lot of your mainstream chart success ended in that decade as well. Did you feel discouraged when that started to happen?\nNicole: Not really. I've now been in this business for 29 years. I take it as an Olympic swimming competition. There's an A-final and a B-final. You don't have to be first every time, but you have to take care and swim with the others in the A-final.\nCareer today.\n In many European circles, \"schlager\" is almost looked upon as if it were a dirty word, synonymous with \"uncool\" or \"out of touch.\" Do you feel that common threads in schlager songs (namely love and feelings) get stigmatized and mocked, and do you think that's fair?\nNicole: That doesn't faze me much. To me, the audience is the most important thing. I did an unplugged tour a few weeks ago with all the songs from the last three decades. It was fantastic to get standing ovations (nearly 20 minutes every evening). \n Where was your favorite place to perform?\nNicole: The best place to perform was the \"Schmidt's Tivoli\" in Hamburg where we also recorded the \"Live DVD.\" \n In your long career, you have released over 30 albums. Do you have any regrets as far as directions your career has taken? If you could do anything over again, would you?\nNicole: I would do the same all over again, no doubt!\nGeneral thoughts about Eurovision.\n And 27 years later, you remain the only Eurovision winner from Germany.\nNicole: In 1982, it was the right song, with the right girl, at the right place. As I said before, it was a three-minute magic moment when I was on stage. An honest girl with an honest authentic song, telling a message everybody understood.\n Some of the German performers and entries in recent years had inventive themes, especially Roger Cicero's swing song and Texas Lightning's country performance. How do you feel about these \"theme\" entries?\nNicole: In my opinion, every artist should be authentic, no matter what kind of song.\n Do you feel the allegations of \"bloc voting,\" favoring Eastern European countries over Western European countries (of which Germany is a part), are true? Also with the advent of telephone voting, do you feel the Contest has drifted in a direction where Eurovision is no longer \"about the song\"?\nNicole: Yes, it's true. The eastern European countries obviously support each other with the so-called \"bloc voting.\" It's now a political affair and no longer a \"song contest.\"\n Do you ever see yourself returning to the Eurovision stage as the German representative?\nNicole: No. I can't top being #1.\n Will you be a part of the German delegation going to Moscow this year? If no decision has been made yet, would you like to go?\nNicole: I haven't been asked yet, but of course I would like to be a part of the German delegation. Eurovision is still on my mind.\n In closing, what would you like to say to all of your fans who have followed your career these past three decades?\nNicole: I want to thank all my fans for their loyalty and believing in me and my music. Thanks for walking side by side with me through the years.\nSource.\n __NOEDITSECTION__"}

They were joined by staff at Heysham nuclear power station in neighbouring Lancashire. Workers at sites affected by industrial action last week walked out again today, with 200 leaving the Fiddlers Ferry Power Station in Cheshire and a further 1,000 at Grangemouth oil refinery and Longannet power station.\nThe UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown had condemned the wildcat action on Sunday, calling it \"counterproductive\". This drew criticism from unions and opposition parties as he had previously promised \"British jobs for British workers\" at the Labour Party's conference in 2008. Brown has insisted that clarification of European Union law and European Court of Justice decisions will allow people to see that discrimination doesn't take place in future.\nThe Secretary of State for Business Lord Mandelson has backed the site's owners Total S.A., telling the BBC that the company had \"very strongly refuted\" the allegations and that he believed them to be right. He added that the media was \"feeding this xenophobia\". He added that he hoped the rebuttal would calm the situation, saying \"I hope in the light of that people will be reassured and call off these unofficial disputes\".\nThis drew an angry reaction from the GMB union. General Secretary Paul Kenny said \"Peter Mandelson is in denial about the nature of the problem that has given rise to the dispute. Overseas companies are refusing to employ UK nationals on projects in the UK. That is not right\".\nLord Mandelson's shadow, Kenneth Clarke, also condemned the strikes on behalf of the opposition Conservative Party, saying \"I understand people being worried about their jobs. I don't think this is the right way to demonstrate it\". Some Labour MPs, however, have expressed more sympathy with the strikers. Health Secretary Alan Johnson called for EU law to be changed to stop global companies undercutting local wage rates, while former minister Frank Field said \"This form of contract clearly cannot go on, where contracts are awarded and there's free movement of companies but those companies then restrict who can apply for those jobs\". Another former minister, Peter Hain, also sided with the strikers, blaming the government for \"gold plating\" EU law (making EU-derived laws stronger or stricter than the original directive) and telling them to \"stick up for British workers\". The leader of the Liberal Democrats Nick Clegg sounded a warning note about changing British or EU law, saying that \"any attempt to ban EU citizens from jobs in Britain would be a massive own goal. If every EU country followed suit, we would have to cope with a massive influx of British people who work overseas\".\nThe unofficial protests began on Friday, when workers in industrial plants across the country walked out in sympathy with the staff at Lindsey Oil Refinery in North Lincolnshire. The refinery are striking over the awarding of a contract by the French-owned site to an Italian company. This led to 200-300 Italian and Portuguese workers arriving at the plant. Unions allege that British workers were actively prevented from applying for the jobs.\nProtests have continued today outside the refinery."}

After the arrest, the teenager, Cheyene Back, pleaded guilty to intentionally or recklessly damaging property.\nCheyene Back had been captured on a closed-circuit security camera at the \"Hyde Park Cafe\" on Macquarie Street, when she and friends wrote on the wall. Robert Napoli, a co-defendant, has had his case adjourned. They were arrested by police outside the caf\u00e9.\nOn Tuesday, Magistrate Ian McRae sentenced Back to three months in jail for her offences, even though Back is a first-time offender in the eyes of the court. Back, who is from Daceyville, immediately lodged an appeal and has been freed on unconditional bail until the appeal is heard.\nThe owner of the caf\u00e9, Song Wang, is seeking A$200 in compensation for the damages, however, she does not believe the jail sentence is appropriate.\n\"Give them more education, provide more education, and let them do some community service,\" she said. Nevertheless, Back and her friends are habitual offenders, according to Wang.\n\"This group did came [sic] to my cafe every week around Wednesday or Thursday, once a week,\" she said. \"One day the girl made [graffiti] just inside the toilet and all over the walls and smashed my mirror. They even got on the roof, I don't know how they did that, it was all over.\"\n\"You know it was really frustrating when she did it, but the whole group did it, not just her,\" Wang said. \"I think it's a little bit harsh ... Maybe she can do some community work or something, such as letting her clean all the graffiti off, let her know how hard the work is she makes [sic].\"\nNew South Wales Premier Nathan Rees welcomed the jail term. He says everywhere he goes, graffiti is a problem.\n\"This sends a message that it's not something that the community regards as a frivolous offence,\" Rees said. \"It is something that affects not only the aesthetic but people's sense of safety around the place if they see graffiti around and they think there is other anti-social behaviour going with it. I think a three-month jail term is absolutely appropriate.\"\nProfessor Chris Cunneen, a criminologist at the University of New South Wales says the jail sentence does not match the scale of the crime.\n\"In the adult courts, a normal sort of penalty in relation to that offence would be a fine of some sort and some form of restitution for the property owner,\" Cunneen said.\nAccording to anti-vandalism group \"Graffiti Hurts\", graffiti costs Australian taxpayers A$500 million each year."}

Wen was on a seven day tour of Europe, his final stop being the University.\nThe man yelled \"dictator\" and asked the crowd, \"how can this university prostitute itself with this dictator here, how can you listen...to him unchallenged,\" as he threw the shoe at the prime minister. Wen called the incident \"despicable\". The shoe did not hit Wen, but landed a few feet from where he was standing.\n\"His [the man's] behavior met strong opposition of the entire audience.

Jade North asked for a release from his freshly-signed North Queensland contract to pursue a future with Incheon United after only five weeks.\nFowler, who was nicknamed \"God\" by Liverpool fans following his amazing feats for the Merseyside club\u2014128 goals in 266 matches across two periods with the club\u2014left English Premier League club Blackburn Rovers in December and was a free agent. He has been capped 26 times for England at senior level, most recently at the 2002 FIFA World Cup, and is the fourth-highest goal-scorer in the 17-season history of the Premier League.\nThe 33-year-old was announced as in talks with the club in mid-January, and met with Matheson and inaugural Fury manager Ian Ferguson in Townsville for an inspection before flying back to England on January 22 to discuss the move with his family. \"I had nothing but good things to tell my family about the football side of things and the lifestyle opportunities North Queensland can offer us,\" Fowler was quoted as saying.\nThe signing is a huge boost for the club, who will enter the A-League later this calendar year along with fellow expansion club Gold Coast United, also based in Queensland. Gold Coast, who have secured current Socceroos midfielder Jason \u010culina as their marquee player, are largely viewed as the more glamorous of the two, however owner Matheson said this signing went a long way to redressing that.\n\"Robbie is a legitimate international super star of the game and there\u2019s no doubt he will give us every chance of winning,\" Matheson said."}

In addition, it has placed a full-page ad in USA Today's Monday edition. The promotion was further announced on The Today Show and notices were also sent out to the chain's \"Denny's Breakfast Club\" members. \nThe NBC ad, which was bought to unveil a new promotion for customers squeezed by the recession, may have cost as much as $3 million, said Nelson Marchioli, CEO of Denny's Corp. Super Bowl XLIII's 30-second commercial time slot costs $2.4 million\u2013$3 million for the airtime alone, excluding production and talent costs. \nThe game was televised live by the US NBC Sunday Night Football and Canada's CTV Television Network. BayTSP has reported that, \"as of 10 a.m. Wednesday, commercials that initially aired during NBC's Super Bowl XLIII broadcast subsequently had been watched online more than 28 million times.\"\n\"The promotion has a total cost of $5 million U.S., which includes $3 million for the commercial on NBC,\" said a Denny's spokesman, noting also that the company received about $50 million in news coverage, most of which was positive. According to a Denny's representative, two million people walked through the restaurant chains\u2019 doors Tuesday, and each Denny\u2019s restaurant served an average of 130 Grand Slams per hour.\nWith the \"Denny's Feeds America\" promotion, the company has reported 14 million hits on its Web site between Sunday night and Monday morning. Denny's shares rose 6 cents, or 3.1 percent, to $1.98 in afternoon trading. The stock has traded in a range of $1.18 to $4.10 over the past 52 weeks. \n\"Denny's free Grand Slam\" has ranked in the top 10 Google searches early Tuesday and fell to No. 18 by the end of the promotion, while \u201cdenny s locations\u201d was #9 on Google Trends, which tracks fast-rising searches. It has also held spots No. 1 (Denny's) and 7 (Grand Slam) on Twitter's trending topics. It has generated much chat on Twitter, garnering 1,700 tweets on Tuesday, compared with its average of 59. Doritos, winner of the USA TODAY survey for best Super Bowl spot ad, had 933 mentions after reaching a peak of almost 3,300. \nThe idea of the TV ad was to get people to come in and re-evaluate Denny\u2019s Diner. \u201cA lot of people have forgotten what Denny\u2019s is, or they think they know, while we\u2019ve come out with a whole lot of new products. We felt like we needed to jump start the brand,\u201d Denny\u2019s Chief Marketing and Innovation Officer Mark Chmiel said. \n\"We're celebrating the Grand Slam this year,\" Chmiel said. According to the company's financial data, on January 15 Denny's reported systemwide comparable-store sales for the fourth quarter were down 6.1 percent, compared to a 0.2 percent decline from the same period in 2007.\nAccording to Robert Gonzalez, public relations company Hill &amp; Knowlton spokesman, Denny's has expected at least 2 million people to eat a free Grand Slam by the end of the promotion. \"Every restaurant is packed with people and lines,\" Gonzalez said. \"Everything today is about fast. People are on the go, and they're eating fast food. It's cutting into sit-down dining,\" he added. \n\"Each of the more than 1,500 Denny's were planning to make about 100 Grand Slams an hour,\" Denny's spokeswoman Cori Rice said. It had predicted it will have served about 1,400 people per location, more than five times the normal volume. \"Grand Slam Breakfast\" is a four-item option on its menu, consisting of two pancakes, two eggs, two strips of bacon and two sausage links. It weighs in at 44 grams of fat, 56 carbohydrates and 770 calories.\nNationwide, Denny's expected to sell about 2 million Grand Slams \u2014 about 15 percent of the annual tally. According to Mark Chmiel, chief marketing operator and executive vice president, the diner chain has reported approximately 2 million meals worth more than $12 million were given away nationwide and each Denny\u2019s restaurant served an average of 130 Grand Slams per hour. It estimated it has earned about $50 million worth of public relations following the free Grand Slam campaign, Chmiel said. \nThe company is also experimenting with a Grand Slam Burrito and also has introduced for this year, a Grand Slamwich, which includes eggs, bacon, sausage and cheese between two slices of bread, with a teaspoon serving. \"It already has shown strong consumer appeal,\" said Chmiel. The company has received flood of e-mails and letters proving the positive impact of the Grand Slam campaign and commercials on its customers.\nChmiel also announced he's planning a third major promotion in this year's third quarter, which happens to include another major sporting event, the World Series. \"That's one we're definitely looking at,\" he said.\nJobless Paris Winslow of downtown San Francisco, California has joined the long line which stretched from the front door on Mission Street, between Fourth and Fifth streets, to the corner of Fourth and up the block. \"The economy is getting kind of scary. This line looks like those pictures of soup kitchen lines during the 1929 Great Depression,\" Winslow said.\n\"I came all the way from San Francisco for a free $6 meal, Isn't that pathetic? A year ago, I never would have done this. These days I'm willing to put my ego on the back burner,\" said Stephen Weller, a jobless contractor who waited with his dog, Emmett. California Denny's restaurant managers have issued rain checks (for free chilled meals, as security backed by actual bacon) to anyone who failed to get in by the 2 p.m. deadline. \nA big eater could also \"Slam It Up\" by adding any two additional items for 99 cents each to their meal. Customers on Tuesday were also handed \"bounceback\" coupon books that include offers for additional free menu items with purchases. Chicago Tribune reporter Kevin Pang has eaten five free Grand Slams on Tuesday at five different Denny's Diners in four hours. He claims to have consumed 4,100 calories at Harwood Heights, 5:36 a.m, at Schiller Park, 6:22 a.m., at Franklin Park, 7:08 a.m., at Melrose Park, 7:41 a.m. and at Grand Slam No. 5 Oak Park, 8:57 a.m.\n\"The Grand Slam has always been a Denny's favorite. This free offer is our way of reacquainting America with Denny's real breakfast and with the Denny's brand,\" Denny's CEO Nelson Marchioli said in a statement. In 1977s, the Grand Slam started as a baseball-related promotion in Atlanta, Georgia. Its normal price averages around $5.99. Marchioli said the event was also a way to kick-off its \"Year of the Grand Slam\" promotion. Denny's claimed it has sold 12.5 million Grand Slams a year. \n\"The economy's tough and people are jumping all the way to fast food to try to figure it out. We all use fast food, whether it's for time or convenience or for money. But you can go to Denny's and you don't have to give up a real breakfast and that was the whole focus of our commercial,\" Marchioli explained. McDonald's (MCD, Fortune 500) has done well during this economic meltdown since the global recession pushes people toward less expensive dining options. \nMcDonald's has announced plans Wednesday to open 175 new restaurants in China this year despite the global economic crisis, thereby increasing the number of outlets in China by 17 percent, from 1,050 currently. Last month, McDonald's 2008 net profit has risen 80 percent from 2007 to 4.3 billion dollars.\nMarchioli has also introduced Denny's $4 Weekday Express Slam, which is a streamlined version of the Grand Slam. \"I want to take back share. For too long, we have allowed others to take share, whether it was Starbucks or McDonald's. They're fine competitors and I don't expect to take all their business from them, but I'd like a little bit back,\" Marchioli noted.\nAccording to Rafi Mohammed, author of \"The Art of Pricing,\" people love free. \"It triggers a Pavlovian response in people,\" said Mohammed. If Pavlov's dogs salivate when a bell rings, Denny's free Grand Slam breakfast has attracted 2 million hungry customers. \"I believe free maximizes trial and doesn't devalue a product as long as it is a rare event. Aside from the cost, the major downside is that it attracts customers who truly have no intention of coming back,\" he added.\nAccording to University of Portland consumer psychology professor Deana Julka, people flock to free promotions amid just a few dollars saving because there's nothing in life for free. \"So when there's something out there that costs nothing, it creates a psychological rush. Especially in these times when people feel overtaxed or overburden, there's an internal reward people feel by getting something for free,\" she said. \"It's being thrifty and feeling like you beat the system. Free really hits the spot for a lot of people,\" Julka added.\n\"Free is an emotional hot button. When free is concerned, there is no downside - or, at least, we don't see the downside immediately. So we overvalue everything that is free. People love free stuff, particularly when money's tight,\" said Dan Ariely, a business professor at Duke University, author of \"Predictably Irrational: The Hidden Forces That Shape Our Decisions.\"\nExperts, however, explained these moves need to be done sparingly, since giveaways can teeter in the balance between desperation and a well designed marketing ploy. \"Giving your product away for free is not worth it because it undermines your brand value,\" said branding expert Rob Frankel, saying people are attached to the idea of it being free, than the actual product itself. \nFree giveaways are not anything new in the food industry. \"It just feels good when you can get something for free and not have to worry about it coming out of your wallet,\" Frankel noted. Dunkin' Donuts and Panera Bread all have had free coffee and food promos last year. \"In November, Starbucks gave away free cup of coffee to anyone who came in on Election Day. Have you taken a look at how Starbucks is doing now?\" Last week it has announced it would shut down 300 stores, in addition to the 600 it already planned to close.\nOn February 24, IHOP will be offering a free shortstack to every customer to encourage donations (in place of the cost) for Childrens Miracle Network. The International House of Pancakes (IHOP) is a United States-based restaurant chain that specializes in breakfast foods and is owned by DineEquity. The chain had more than 1950 restaurants in all 50 states, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Canada and Mexico. Since 2006, IHOP's National Pancake Day celebration has raised over $1.85 million. In 2008, over 1.5 million pancakes (12 miles high if they were stacked) were given to customers for donations.\nDenny's (\"Denny's Diner\") is a full-service diner/family restaurant chain in the United States. It operates over 2,500 restaurants in the United States (including Puerto Rico), Canada, Cura\u00e7ao, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Jamaica, Japan, Mexico, and New Zealand). The resto chain is known for always being open, serving breakfast, lunch, dinner, and dessert around the clock.\nToday, Denny's operates about 1,600 restaurants in all 50 U.S. states, Canada and Mexico. There are also about 578 Denny's restaurants in Japan operated under a license by a subsidiary of Seven &amp; I Holdings, seven Denny's locations in New Zealand, and approximately 38 Denny's diners in the United States. Denny's headquarters is now located in Spartanburg, South Carolina, headquarters of the parent company Trans World Corporation that acquired Denny's in 1987.\nDenny's was historically notable for offering a \"free meal\" to anyone on their birthday. The offer included a limited number of meal options from a special birthday menu. The promotional ritual ceased in 1993, though occasionally individual franchises will continue the tradition. \nIn 2008, Denny's has ceased to be in the ranks among the top diner chains in the $83 billion breakfast market, whose top five firms -- McDonald's, Starbucks, Dunkin' Donuts, Burger King and IHOP -- accounted for 22 percent of the volume. \"A lot of consumers have written Denny's off their let's-go-there list,\" said Ron Paul, president of Technomic, a consulting firm. \nSuper Bowl XLIII was an American football game between the American Football Conference champion Pittsburgh Steelers (15\u20134) and the National Football Conference champion Arizona Cardinals (12\u20138) to decide the National Football League (NFL) champion for the 2008 NFL season. It was played on February 1, 2009, at Raymond James Stadiumin Tampa, Florida. It has an attendance of 70,774 and 98.7 million viewers. Pittsburgh earned its sixth Super Bowl win, thus securing sole possession of the record for most Super Bowl wins. "}

The BBC has declined to name the tennis player in question.\nThe BBC said that it had hoped for an unconditional apology from the 55-year-old journalist and \"I'm a Celebrity Get Me Out of Here\" winner after staff reported that the remark to management, but a spokesman said \"We're no longer going to be working with her on \"The One Show\"\" when the apology did not appear.\nThatcher's spokesman said that she \"never intended any racist comment\", adding that \"[s]he made a light aside about this tennis player and his similarity to the golliwog on the jam pot when she was growing up. There's no way, obviously, that she would condone any racist comment - we would refute that entirely. It would not be in her nature to do anything like that\". He said that \"[s]he has summarily apologised\".\nThe BBC said that remarks of this type were \"wholly unacceptable\". Former Conservative cabinet minister Lord Tebbit said \"It does seem very odd that Jonathan Ross can be back broadcasting having made obscene, insulting remarks on the air, and Carol Thatcher, who said something which is allegedly highly offensive but which I rather doubt was meant to be so, in private, should be banned in this way,\" adding, \"It is probably a bit of a way for the BBC to get back at Carol's mother\". The AFP news agency reports that Thatcher will still work with the BBC on other projects.\nThe Corporation has suffered scandals in the last few years, such as the recent Russell Brand-Jonathan Ross episode, which saw the two presenters making obscene phone calls to actor Andrew Sachs."}

In some regions the system returned to the match just before the goal, but viewers in the south of England saw only the celebrations after the goal.\nMichael Grade, executive chairman of ITV, admitted to ITN that the broadcast had been a shambles and said that \"yellow or red cards\" would go to those responsible once it was established how it happened. ITV has received over 1,000 complaints. ITV has previously had issues with FA Cup coverage.

The Bombardier Challenger CL-600's crash left twenty people hospitalised and prosecutors allege that regular breaches of federal law were to blame.\nThe business jet had been privately chartered for a flight to Chicago Midway Airport but failed to take off. Instead, the aircraft broke through a fence, crossed Route 46 and struck a warehouse, causing a fire. The plane clipped two cars on the way across the road and the accident left eleven people onboard the aircraft and nine more on the ground hospitalised.\nThe National Transportation Safety Board investigated the accident and found that the flight crew had miscalcualted the aircraft's centre of gravity and that overfilling the fuel tanks had moved it too far forward. \nAccording to a federal indictment filed Wednesday, six men within the company were \"routinely undertaking and concealing dangerous fueling and weight-distribution practices.\" Three co-founders of Platinum - Michael Brassington, 35, his brother Paul Brassington, 29, and Andre Budhan, 42, as well as maintenance director Brien McKenzie, also 42, have been arrested and pilot Francis Vieira, 59, and director of charters Joseph Singh, 37, are being sought.\nThe 23-count indictment says that Michael Brassington, McKenzie and Vieira regularly stated in paperwork that aircraft were operating at weights up to 1,000 pounds lighter than the true value in breach of Federal Aviation Administration laws. It also accuses Platinum of operating commercial charters for a year between November 2002 and November 2003 without a valid licence and filing such flights as noncommercial. \nThe document goes on to accuse Platinum of using pilots that lacked proper training; in particular John Kimberling, who flew the jet that crashed, was not adequatly qualified to fly commercial flights, which have stricter regulations than noncommercial air operations. He has not been charged himself at this time, but investigations continue. The \"Southern Ledger\" states the accused face charges of \"conspiracy, fraud, endangering the safety of aircraft and making false statements to the National Transportation Safety Board.\"\nSources.\n "}

He reaffirmed that the British government did not want the material released because doing so would \"cause real and significant damage to the national security and international relations of this country\".\nBinyam Mohamed, a British resident but not a citizen, was arrested by U.S. forces in Pakistan in 2002. From there, he claims, he was moved to other locations where he was tortured on behalf of U.S. operatives (a process known as \"extraordinary rendition\") with the knowledge of UK intelligence agencies before being sent to the detention centre at Guantanamo Bay. The U.S. said he had planned a \"dirty bomb\" terrorist attack, but, after holding him for 4 years under the threat of the death penalty, dropped the charges.\nMohamed says that any evidence against him was based on what he said under torture and asked the High Court to force the government to reveal any documentation they held that would prove this. The judges have agreed, but have not published the material. Following the Foreign Secretary's statement to parliament, Mohamed's lawyers have written to the court to ask the judges to now publish. They say that, since Milliband has denied that the United States made the threat, the judges' decision to withhold it no longer applied.\nMohamed claims to have spent 550 days being tortured for information in Morocco. He says his genitals were repeatedly cut with a razor blade to make him confess. The court case in London is part of his bid to force the UK government to release evidence it holds that he claims shows the U.S. was directly involved in the torture. A British official was also present when he was tortured, he claims.\nThe court case and the British government's reaction to it comes at a time when British politicians are adjusting to a new relationship with their American counterparts. The UK was a solid supporter of former President George W. Bush's \"war on terror\", but the British government now faces building a relationship with the new U.S. administration which was elected with plans for a different approach to the subject. The British government has repeatedly denied that it was involved in \"extraordinary rendition\" and evidence otherwise would be politically damaging."}

Circuit Judge Barry then used the 1993 version of the Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary to define the word \"obtain.\" The pertinent part, pages 9 to 10 of the 13-page decision provides as follows:\nJudge Walls sentenced Aquino to 76 months imprisonment for violation of 18 United States Code 793(e), punishable under the harsher United States Sentencing Guidelines, 2M3.2, (Gathering National Defense Information, which imposes 35 years sentence if top secret and 30 years, if not) instead of the more lenient 2M3.3 (Transmitting National Defense Information, etc.)\nBecause of the Barry decision which modified the original Hall's sentence, Aquino now faces 37 to 46 months imprisonment when he is resentenced by the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey. Since he has already served 40 months, he could be immediately released. \nBut since he was initially arrested in September 2005 for tourist visa rules violations, he will be delivered by the judicial authorities to United States Citizenship and Immigration Services when he leaves McRae Correctional Institution in Georgia. Aquino will be processed for deportation. McRae is a city in Telfair County, Georgia, United States.\nMichael Ray Aquino was a former Deputy Directory of the Philippines National Police Intelligence Group and former senior superintendent of the now-disbanded Philippines Presidential Anti-Organized Crime Task Force under former Philippines president Joseph Estrada. \nOn November 24, 2000, PR man Bubby Dacer and his driver Emmanuel Corbito were kidnapped along the corner Zobel Roxas Street in Manila and the South Super Highway by gunmen believed to be members of the PNP. Four days after, the victims' charred remains, consisting of burnt bones, metal dental plates and a ring, were later found in Barangay Buna Lejos, Indang, Cavite. Both victims were killed by strangulation.\nP/Col. Glenn Galapon Dumlao, one of the accused, named former Po/Supt. Cezar O. Mancao II and former S/Supt. Michael Ray Aquino as the brains behind the crime. Mancao and Aquino were members of Presidential Anti-Organized Crime Task Force or PAOCTF, headed by then Gen. Panfilo Lacson. Suspects Mancao and Aquino left the country after being implicated in the heinous crime. Dumlao disappeared afterwards but later resurfaced in the US. \nIn 2005, murder cases were filed in Philippine courts and arrests warrants were issued against accused Dumlao, Aquino and Mancao. Dumlao, a resident of Patchogue, New York was arrested and held without bail on November 20, 2008 by virtue of a warrant of arrest issued by Judge William D. Wall. On December 10, Dumlao was ordered extradited to the Philippines by Judge A. Kathleen Tomlinson of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York in Long Island, New York. \nThe initial hearing of the extradition case of Dumlao\u2019s co-accused, Mancao II, now detained in Florida, was held on December 3, in the US District Court in Southern Florida in Fort Lauderdale. Justice Secretary Raul M. Gonzalez had requested the US Justice Department to extradite Mancao and Dumlao to face murder charges in the Philippines. An extradition hearing has yet to be initiated for Aquino, although, as trusted officer of then PNP chief, now senator, Panfilo Lacson, was also requested for extradition by the Philippine government to face trial for the Dacer-Corbito double murder.\n\"Sir, the other day Leandro 'Lean' Aragoncillo called me. ... He wants to talk to you and give you some updates on the political situation in the country,\" wrote Aquino in an e-mail of January 2005 to his former boss Sen. Panfilo \"Ping\" Lacson. \"I find all the information that you are sending me very useful. I hope you will continue sending more,\" replied Sen. Lacson in an e-mail he allegedly sent in January 2005 to Aragoncillo. \"By no means would you show this information. ... I will be affected severely. Again, please protect the source - Me,\" said Aragoncillo in an E-mail he allegedly sent in August 2005 to former Philippines President Joseph Estrada.\nIn March 2005, Aquino was arrested by immigration authorities for overstaying his visa. He contacted his friend, Leandro Aragoncillo, a Philippine-born civilian FBI Intelligence Analyst, who worked in the White House (between 1999 and 2002) as \"administration chief\" of the security detail assigned to the Vice President (Gore and then Cheney). However, Aragoncillo's efforts on Aquino's behalf eventually led to Aragoncillo being investigated by the FBI. In the course of that investigation, evidence of espionage against the United States Government was uncovered. \nAccording to reports complied by Filipino intelligence professionals, there were indications of a link between Aragoncillo and the French intelligence service, Direction g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 ext\u00e9rieure. Frequent visits by Aragoncillo to Manila allegedly were interspersed with clandestine meetings between identified, French operatives and several \"illegals\" (i.e. unregistered agents) around 2002 to 2004.\n\"What it means is that there is a hole in White House security. There are two kinds of people at the White House: Those that have been very well-vetted and those that have been extremely well-vetted and have access to the top secret computer network. This man had access to the top secret computer network.\" said Richard A. Clarke, a former White House adviser. \n\"The FBI said Aragoncillo was concerned about e-mailing from his personal account so many classified documents from FBI computers, and he asked one recipient, Filipino opposition Sen. Panfilo \"Ping\" Lacson, whether he was a nuisance. \"The reply, court records say, came back two days later in a cell phone message intercepted by the FBI: \"What you are sending are never a nuisance to me. They are in fact informative and very useful,\" Clark added. \nIn September 2005, Aragoncillo, a retired US Marine Gunnery Sergeant with 21 years service was suspended by the FBI, and arrested for violation of Title 18 of the US Code, Sections 371 and 951, admitting espionage activities from August 2000 to August 2005, and taking files while working under VP Cheney from 2001-2002, including giving information to another country.\nIn July 2007, Aragoncillo, age 50, a naturalized US citizen residing in Woodbury, New Jersey was sentenced to 10 years imprisonment for \"transferring classified information to assist in overthrow of Philippines government.\" Aragoncillo, admitted passing information by cellphone text messages and e-mail messages through Hotmail and Yahoo accounts, to Aquino, former President Joseph Estrada, Sen. Panfilo Lacson, and opposition politicians, who wanted to oust Mrs. Arroyo, including former House Speaker Arnulfo Fuentebella, according to court documents. He will be released from Federal Correction Institute in Big Spring, Texas on May 28, 2014.\nThe court fined Aragoncillo $40,000. \"I never intended to cause harm or injury to the United States,\" Aragoncillo told the judge. In July 2007, Sen. Panfilo Lacson as well as deposed president Joseph Estrada have admitted to receiving information from Aquino, but they denied any conspiracy. \"Aquino is determined not to return to the country,\" said Sen. Lacson, who admitted extending financial support to Aquino and his family.\nIn July, 2008, Sabina and Carina Dacer, the daughters of missing public relations man Salvador \"Bubby\" Dacer testified at the Manila Regional Trial Court (RTC), after almost eight years of self-exile in the United States. \"In his exact words he said, 'mga anak, kung may mangyari sa akin, walang ibang may kakagawan noon kundi si Ping Lacson, (my daughters, if anything happens to me, no one but Ping Lacson is responsible)\" Sabina Dacer told ABS-CBN News and Current Affairs. \"Hindi naman kilala ng daddy ko si Michael Ray Aquino as far as we know eh. So kung hindi siya kilala ng daddy ko, sino yung kilala niya na kilala ng daddy ko? (My dad does not know Michael Ray Aquino as far as we know. So, if my dad does not know him, whom does he know that my dad knows?)\" Carina Dacer said.\nSen. Panfilo Lacson has vehemently denied any involvement in the Dacer-Corbito murder case. \"For the Nth time, I will assert the truth that I had nothing to do with it,\" said Lacson in a text message. \"They can lie and make people lie even under oath and before a court of law to make me look bad and guilty in the Dacer case. In fact, right after Dacer disappeared, the family sought my help... And I responded the way I should as a law enforcement officer at that time,\" Lacson explained.\nOn Saturday, September 10, 2005, Aquino was also arrested at Queens, New Jersey and was charged with conspiracy and acting as an agent of a foreign official in the jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey, presided by U.S. District Judge William H. Walls. Aquino was accused of helping Aragoncillo transmit classified United States documents regarding President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo to her opponents in the Philippines, including both former President Joseph Estrada and current opposition leader, Panfilo Lacson, who had been Aquino's superior in the police force. \nIn an indictment of 6 Oct 2005 signed and filed by United States Attorney Christopher J. Christie, the Grand Jury sitting at Newark, New Jersey, accused Aquino with charges of - \"knowingly communicating classified information by a government employee to an agent or representative of a foreign country (i.e. receiving classified information), acting as an agent of a foreign official without notification of the Attorney General, in violation of Title 18 of the US Code, Section 951, conspiracy to commit all of the above offenses in violation of Title 18 of the US Code, Section 371, and not cooperating with authorities, under Title 18 of the US Code, Section 2.\nUnder an eventual plea-bargain agreement, Aquino entered a plea of guilty to illegal possession of classified documents, but avoided the more serious charge of espionage which Aragoncillo received. On July 17, 2007, Aquino was sentenced to six years and four months in prison by U.S. District Judge William H. Walls. Federal prosecutors had sought the maximum 10-year term.\nAquino \"did subject our nation to some peril,\" ruled Judge Walls. \"I am sorry for what I did. I never had the intention to harm the United States. I love this country,\" said Aquino who addressed the court for three minutes before sentencing, and apologized. On November 21, 2008 his reduced sentence request was submitted to the appellate court.\nMeantime, the Philippine National Police (PNP) is monitoring developments in the Aquino espionage case. \u201cOf course we are interested in his case, but all we can do is to wait for the outcome of the case of Michael Ray in the US,\u201d said a police official. \nThe Alliance for A Just and Lasting Peace in the Philippines has criticized the judgment: \"For the AJLPP the news of the release proves that the charade of injustice is ever present when it comes to the cabal of AFP men who served as worst human rights violator and proven puppets of the United States military like the Lacson boys,\" the AJLPP said. \"On the other cases of oppressed immigrants like the Baoanan case languishes in courts and not acted upon. So much for double standard of American justice system.\" The AJLPP statement concluded."}

These fires were caused by a severe heat wave affecting the country, combined with winds reported to have reached gale force. According to a report by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, the fires have burned approximately 30,000 acres (12,140 hectares) of land since they began on Friday. State police officials stated that there are still several more fires being fought, and feared that the death toll could reach as much as double the currently confirmed number when all fires are extinguished and investigations begin.\nTemperatures in Victoria today reached 46\u00b0 Celsius (115\u00b0 Fahrenheit), with the combination of temperatures and high winds helped to fuel the fires. The fire was reported to be moving at an estimated 60 kilometers per hour (40 miles per hour). \"This has been an absolute tragedy for the state and we believe this figure may only get worse. We're concerned this figure could even reach up into the 40s,\" stated Kieran Walshe, the Victoria Police Deputy Commissioner, referring to the death toll.\n\"The whole of Kinglake is ablaze, I live a couple of kilometers out of town, I heard explosions, by the time I got to the road there were fires everywhere. [There is] flame everywhere, trees exploding, gas tanks exploding, buildings on fire, it's very, very, very serious,\" said a resident of Kinglake, a small township north of Melbourne that was greatly affected by the flames. \"I can't quite see down into the main stretch of town, but there's a lot of flame coming up from there, so I presume most of the town is going up,\" he also stated. Kinglake has had the most deaths in the fire outbreak so far, where it was reported that six people traveling in a car were all killed when it was set ablaze by the raging flames.\nOver 30,000 volunteers are currently fighting the blazes across the country, along with the help of helicopters and aircraft dropping chemicals and water onto the site hoping to help extinguish the fire. Greg Esnouf, the Victoria Country Fire Authority deputy chief, stated that conditions for firefighters were \"off the scale\" dangerously, and also stated that the forecast for Sunday would not be different than the previous few days.\nVictoria Police have reported that they are suspecting that some of the fires were lit through arson, and are currently in the process of questioning a resident about a fire that started outside of the city. Another man was arrested in connection with deliberately lighting the fire, but was released by police and had arson charges dropped. \nAccording to the Australian Bureau of Meteorology, the heat wave is expected to continue throughout the weekend and peaking in the southeastern part of the country, with temperatures not expected to get cooler until early next week.

However, the Kyrgyz government says that the two moves are not related.\nU.S. State Department spokesman Gordon Duguid said that there was no official word from the Kyrgyz government upon the status of the base.\nThe U.S. has meanwhile requested to transport supplies through Russia instead. The neighboring country of Tajikistan has offered to allow the transport of non-military goods to Afghanistan.\nCurrently, most shipments by NATO and the US come into Afghanistan through neighboring Pakistan, but NATO has become concerned about the safety of that route, as transport convoys have become increasingly under attack from Al Qaeda and the Taliban.\nThe closing of the base comes at a critical time for the U.S., as the nation is planning a large increase in the number of U.S. troops in Afghanistan."}

Now the company has tripled that number, forecasting a 450 billion yen (US$4.95 billion) loss. This would be the first yearly loss at Toyota in 70 years.\nThe firm also said that it predicts its global sales to fall by 17.87% to 7.32 million vehicles sold, compared to last year's 8.91 million vehicles sold. Overall for 2008, Toyota's car sales in the United States were down 15.4%, but that number was down from 2007 in which sales dropped 18%. For the month of January alone, Toyota's sales fell 31.7% compared to the overall U.S. sales loss of 37.1%.\nAs a result of the loss, 17 of the company's 75 production lines worldwide, will be reduced to only a single shift of workers. The company also announced a full closure of all their Japanese plants for a total of 14 days between January and March 2009. \nToyota's boss Katsuaki Watanabe described the loss as happening only \"once in a hundred years\".\nIn January, the Japanese \"Nikkei\" newspaper said that Toyota was thinking of firing 1,000 Northern American and British workers, all of whom hold full-time positions in the company.

Rescuers were able to get him out of the water, but he died while being flown to a nearby hospital for treatment.\nThe Coast Guard also said that the fishermen were warned that the ice could break, but many didn't believe there was any danger.\n\"We were in no danger. We knew there was enough ice out there,\" said Swanton, Ohio resident Norb Pilaczynski, one of those rescued from the ice. Before heading onto the already broken ice, they made a makeshift bridge from wooden pallets to get to and from the shore, but the ice shifted and the bridge was destroyed. It left all 135 people stranded more than 1,000 yards from the shoreline.\nThe ice in most parts of the lake can be up to two feet thick, but on Saturday temperatures rose above freezing, with winds of over 35 miles per hour. The combination of both high winds and temperatures, broke the thick ice into dozens of large pieces.\nOttawa County sheriff Bob Bratton called those who avoided the warnings \"idiotic\".\n\"What happened here today was just idiotic.

Most former captives were held, for a time, at the Care rehabilitation center. The center is described as a humane facility. The intent of the center was to re-educate and re-integrate into mainstream Saudi society. It employed counseling, lectures, and generous financial assistance upon graduation.\nThe program was described as successful. It was held up as a model, and the United States encouraged neighboring countries, like Yemen, to set up similar rehabilitation and reintegration programs.\nThen in January 2009, two former Guantanamo captives, and alumni of the rehabilitation program, Sa'id Ali Jabir Al Khathim Al Shihri (\"ISN 372\") and Abu Hareth Muhammad al-Oufi (\"ISN 333\") appeared in a threatening Al Qaeda video. Said Jabir identified himself as the second in command of Al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula.\nUp until this video became public the Saudi government had claimed the program was a complete success.\nThe two men were among the men listed on the most wanted list. It has been reported that eleven former captives are on the list. The Saudi government hasn't officially identified the former Guantanamo captives in any English language press release; however, reporters and researchers have identified eight former Guantanamo captive on the list, in the English media.\nIn addition to Abu Hareth Muhammad al-Oufi and Sa'id Ali Jabir Al Khathim Al Shihri the other six former captives identified in English language media are:\nAdnan Al-Sayegh \"(ISN 105)\", \nYusuf Al Jebairi Al Shahri \"(ISN 114)\",\nOthman Al-Ghamdi \"(ISN 184)\",\nTurki Mashawi Al Aseery \"(ISN 185)\",\nMurtadi Muqrim \"(ISN 187)\",\nJaber Jabran \"(ISN 188)\".\nThe transfer of Abu Hareth Muhammad al-Oufi and Sa'id Ali Jabir Al Khathim Al Shihri is widely used as an example of the difficulties in distinguishing which captives no longer posed a threat, and could safely be sent home.

According to sources, Rodriguez was one of 104 players named on a list for testing positive before the 2003 season. The list was compiled in an attempt to determine whether the MLB needed to begin conducting random drug testing.\nAfter the initial report Rodriguez was approached by \"Sports Illustrated\" while he was training for the upcoming season in a Miami area gym. At that time, Rodriguez told the reporter \"You'll have to talk to the union.\" He was also asked for an explanation of his positive test result, to which he commented \"I'm not saying anything.\" According to a report by ESPN, sources claim that Rodriguez was aware that he tested positive for performance-enhancing drugs.\nHowever, in December 2007 after United States Senator George J. Mitchell's Mitchell Report was released accusing such teammates of Rodriguez as Roger Clemens, Jason Giambi and Andy Pettitte of steroid use, Rodriguez appeared on ABC's \"60 Minutes\" and declined the use of any steroid or performance-enhancing drug. He also commented that he would not need the help of steroids, stating, \"I've never felt overmatched on the baseball field. I felt that if I did my, my work as I've done since I was, you know, a rookie back in Seattle, I didn't have a problem competing at any level.\"\nSenator Mitchell stated in a prepared comment yesterday that his report had only named that players that \"had received credible evidence of their illegal purchase, possession, or use of performance enhancing substances.\" He pointed out that he \"did not have access to the results of the 2003 drug testing, and to this day I do not know which players tested positive then.\"\nThe MLB declined to comment directly on the situation due to court orders on the list of names and documents, but did release a statement: \"Information and documents relating to the results of the 2003 MLB testing program are both confidential and under seal by court orders. We are prohibited from confirming or denying any allegation about the test results of any particular player by the court orders. Anyone with knowledge of such documents who discloses their contents may be in violation of those court orders.\"\nRodriguez has been one of the many prominent American baseball players over the past few years who has been linked to the use of performance-enhancing drugs. Other prominent names include both the arguably greatest hitter and pitcher in Major League Baseball history, Barry Bonds and Roger Clemens. Bonds, the all-time Major League record holder for home runs, was linked to steroid use during the BALCO scandal in 2003, while Clemens was named in the Mitchell report in December of 2007.\nThe executive vice president for labor relations of Major League Baseball, Rob Manfred, stated that league commissioner Bud Selig was \"disturbed\" by the linking of steroid use to Rodriguez. Commenting for the league, he said, \"Because the survey testing that took place in 2003 was intended to be non-disciplinary and anonymous, we cannot make any comment on the accuracy of this report as it pertains to the player named.\"\nThe report by \"Sports Illustrated\" also made the claim that Gene Orza, the COO of the Major League Baseball Players Association informed Rodriguez of a random drug test that occurred in September of 2004, a test that was supposed to remain confidential to all players. The MLBPA denied the accusations, commenting \"There was no improper tipping of players in 2004 about the timing of drug tests. In September 2004 MLBPA attorneys met with certain players, but we are not able to confirm or deny the names of any players with whom we met.\" When asked in the \"Sports Illustrated\" report, Orza declined to comment, stating \"I'm not interested in discussing this information with you.\"\nThe anonymous testing of players was started in 2003 by the MLB, in order to get a brief estimate of how many players were using performance-enhancing drugs, leading to the beginning of the mandatory, penalty-enforced testing that began in 2004. 1,198 players took the \"survey test\" in 2003, and the results were later stored in a laboratory in Las Vegas, with codes being used in place of the players names. However, a list of the players actual names that went with the list of codes was kept in a separate office in Long Beach, never intended to ever be together with the codes.\nIn April 2004, federal agents with search warrants raided the two labs looking for information on the 2003 BALCO scandal test results of 10 players, including Barry Bonds. While searching, they found both the list of names and the codes, including the positive test result of Rodriguez. Following the investigation and raid, the MLBPA informed all 104 players on the list that their positive test data had been sized by the federal agents.\nFormer Major League Baseball star and self-confessed steroid user Jos\u00e9 Canseco told the media that the news was old, saying \"I said in my book \"Vindicated\" that he was a known steroid user before 2000.

In his first book, \"Juiced\", references to Rodriguez were removed by the publisher of the book because it could not be confirmed that Canseco actually saw Rodriguez taking steroids. According to the publisher, it was only after Canseco passed a lie detector test that information about Rodriguez was allowed into \"Vindicated\".\nCurrent senior advisor to the Texas Rangers John Hart commented on the situation in an interview with MLB Network. \"I think in the climate that we have today, you don't have much shock anymore. Obviously Alex probably is the best player in baseball. This has always been a special talent and the guy has been putting up Hall of Fame numbers since the day he showed up in the big leagues. I've been in the game for almost 40 years and it hurts a little bit, if in fact this is true. It breaks my heart for the game that we have this kind of thing occurring, But at the same time, a lot of people seem to have been caught in this net,\" he said. \nSince the positive test occurred in 2003 before penalties were instituted, Rodriguez will most likely not be suspended by the MLB as a result of the situation."}

Survivors of tell of how up until 10 minutes before the fire started to tear through their country town people were unaware of how close and dangerous the fire really was.\n24 people from Kinglake and Kinglake West have died and hundreds of houses have burnt to the ground. Over 1,500 people in Kinglake alone have been left homeless, left with a town which has mostly burned to the ground. Many people have been caught in the terrifying position of staying and fighting for their houses or fleeing before the fires arrive. Many of the people who have died have attempted to flee in their cars too late and were caught in the middle of the inferno, some being burned alive. Despite the efforts of firefighters, many towns have been totally destroyed, leaving nothing but piles of ashes. Witnesses and survivors of fires in and , Victoria, describe the towns as being totally wiped out or substantially damaged.\nAuthorities are investigating the fires, some 20% of them are being called arson or have being started by human error, leaving much of the scorched land a crime scene of ashes. Some of the fires were reignited by arsonists after firefighters had already taken control of them, according to one fire official in Victoria. Others are believed to have been started by lighting tires on fire.\n\"Some of these fires have started in localities that could only be by hand, it could not be natural causes,\" said deputy commissioner for the Victoria state police, Kieran Walshe. Fire fighting operations chief, Steve Warrington says that the fire departments \"know [they] have someone who is lighting fires in this community.\"\nThe Federal Government has pledged $10 million (4.4 million pounds) in immediate assistance with more to come as the situation becomes clear. The other States of Australia have also announced their plans to help Victoria and Victorians during this time. New South Wales will send 250 firefighters and 50 tankers. The Australian Capital Territory home to Canberra has pledged 90 firefighters and support equipment. \nAustralia's neighbour New Zealand is currently considering what assistance it will be able to provide. For the moment, the nation has sent 100 firefighters to help with battling the blazes. The team is expected to arrive to Australia in as little as 24 hours.\n\"What we can do is, with that manpower, really help out even if it's just a matter of relieving at times. We've obviously got to make sure we protect our domestic situation as well,\" said New Zealand prime minister ."}

The elections officials have also released the . *The Knesset Board of Elections on Thursday states on their site that results are \"final but not official.\"\nThe unofficial election results (based on 99.7% of votes) has raised one question - whether Netanyahu might be chosen to serve as Prime Minister, given Likud's possible political ability to form a coalition with Yisrael Beiteinu. Another alternative was for Kadima to form a national unity government. But this has seemed unlikely given that it would probably require Tzipi Livni to win Likud's support for any such unity coalition. \nThe real resolution of the electoral deadlock has hinged on the actions of President Shimon Peres, age, 85, a Nobel Peace Prize laureate, as the official in charge of deciding which party should be chosen to form a governing coalition. Observers have pointed to his personal political similarities with Livni as one possible reason for choosing Kadima. On the other hand, Netanyahu's ability to form a true coalition also seemed like one significant consideration. \nHowever, the stability of a right-wing/religious coalition is questionable. The six right wing parties control just 65 seats, leaving such a coalition vulnerable to internal dissention. In any case, President Peres has announced that he will not entertain any attempts to form a government until February 18, when the final results will be certified.\nPresident has phoned Peres Wednesday and wished him well in overseeing the formation of a new government. \u201cYou have only two political parties -- we have 12,\u201d Peres told Obama. The new coalition government that emerges after February 18, whether it is led by hard-line Netanyahu or his moderate rival, Tzipi Livni, is likely to find common ground on two burning issues: Hamas and Iran. \nTwo dire scenarios emerged Wednesday as President Obama faces double dilemmas in Mideast: a narrow coalition of hawks who would stall peacemaking with the Palestinians and a power-sharing arrangement that would give Israel a more moderate face and greater international support. \n\"We want to do things differently in the region. That would involve accelerating efforts to promote Mideast peace talks as well as having discourse with Iran in an environment of mutual respect,\" Obama said at his White House news conference Monday. \"We certainly hope that a new (Israeli) government will continue to pursue a path to peace. I see no reason to think a new government would do something otherwise,\" spokesman Robert Wood said.\n\"Divisions in the Israeli electorate are likely to create 'paralysis in the political process' during the period of coalition building and perhaps beyond. This could lead to an extended \"hiatus\" in peacemaking while the Palestinians confront their own deep political divisions. Nevertheless, the United States should work hard to firm up the Gaza cease-fire and not to give up on the longer-term goal of a two-state solution,\" said , a former top U.S. diplomat in the Mideast and a recent adviser to Barack Obama.\n\"The Israeli political system has been fractured and at odds with itself for many years, so having an outcome in which the two big blocs--the center-right and moderate-right blocs--split the vote was not at all unexpected. There will be a paralysis in the political process, certainly during the period of coalition building and perhaps even beyond, depending on what kind of coalition emerges. The hiatus in peacemaking could be rather extended,\" he explained."}

With great difficulty, the emergency team has waded into the chest-deep water, clapping their hands and hitting the surface to guide and drive the whales farther away from the coastal shore to deeper waters.\n\"The mammals were at first thought to have been dolphins, but experts then identified them as melon-headed whales,\" local veterinarian Mariel Flores said. \"This type of whale can be easily mistaken for dolphins because of their size and their teeth, which resemble those of dolphins. The mammals have ears that are sensitive to large changes in pressure underwater,\" she added.\n\"It looked like they never wanted to leave. They looked sad,\u201d said Rodolfo Joson, a village councilor. Joson and his son, Joey, a fisherman like him, have rushed home at about 4 a.m. to report the pod sighting. \u201cIt was still dark when we waded into the water. The whales were about 200 meters from the shore. The water was up to my neck. We first checked their conditions by playing with them. They did not repel us or leave. They were making hooting sounds,\u201d Joson explained the mass beaching. \u201cIt seemed they were running away from waters that they didn\u2019t like. Dolphins are happy and strong creatures. They raced with ships,\u201d he added.\nA post-mortem examination has revealed that four dead whales found beached farther up north in Abucay, Bataan, include two adult females, one of which was pregnant, while the other gave birth to a calf that also died, said Dr. Lemnuel Aragones of Ocean Adventure in Subic Freeport who did the necropsy at the Bataan fisheries office in Balanga City.\nThis is the first time that such large numbers of dolphins had been stranded in the Philippines. \"We are trying to come up with a possible explanation to this unusual occurrence. It could be that the dolphins had lost their bearings and inadvertently ended up on the shallow portion of the coast unable to extricate themselves,\" said Dr Lemuel Aragones, Associate Professor at the UP Institute of Environmental Science and Meteorology. \nDr Aragones, who holds a PhD on Tropical Environmental Studies (Marine Ecology) from Australia's James Cook University, explained that \"the melon-headed whales of the dolphin family have sophisticated navigation systems that operate on a principle similar to sonar instruments used in submarines. Like humans, dolphins also follow a 'leader' of their pod. It is possible that the leader of this dolphin [pod] had somehow lost its way. In turn, the leader\u2019s acoustic system, which serves as its guidance system, might have been impaired,\" the marine expert elaborated.\nDr Aragones said \"BFAR, UPIESM, and the Ocean Adventure Marine Park in Subic started the Philippine Marine Mammals Stranding Network (PMMSN) in 2005 as a response to cetacean strandings or beachings.\" She cited the PMMSN training received by BFAR officers in Bataan during Tuesday's mass beaching. She has asked the government to release funds for marine mammal studies.\nThe two adults had damaged eardrums, Alberto Venturina, the provincial veterinarian, said. \"Dolphins with injured eardrums become disoriented, cannot dive for food and are too weak to swim and just flow with the current. If it's a sick leader, the animal needs to be identified and taken out of sight of the rest of the pod so the healthy dolphins could be prodded back to sea,\" he added.\"The two animals were identified as melon-headed dolphins, weighing about 250 to 300 kilograms (550 to 660 pounds),\" explained Venturina, adding \"the third dolphin was only a month old and measured barely a meter long. Its gender had not yet been determined.\"\nAccording to Nelson Bien, head of the Fisheries Resource and Management Division of BFAR Region III, a necropsy by BFAR, the provincial veterinarian, and veterinarians from the Ocean Adventure in Subic Freeport has traced the cause of their death to drowning. \nThe marine doctors have determined that the marine mammals might have drowned after failing to extricate themselves from the fishing nets or \"baklad,\" explained Dr. Mundita Lim, director of the Protected Areas and Wildlife Bureau (PAWB) of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR). \u201cThere were no injuries to their ears, like visible lesions, but the possibility of an acoustic problem or trauma is still there,\u201d Dr Lim explained, saying, \"more tests, like analysis of tissue samples and MRI tests will have to be done to see if there were other injuries to the animals not visible externally.\"\nThey are sending tissue samples to the University of Philippines in Los Ba\u00f1os, Laguna for analysis. \u201cIf it was something like climate change, then it would be a bigger environmental problem,\u201d Lim added.\nA fourth and pregnant one was also found dead in the village of Tortugas in the town of Balanga, Bataan, said Bien, saying they were investigating the incident and would conduct a \u201cwater quality and water parameter test\u201d to determine why the dolphins beached to shallow waters. The condition of melon-headed whale found at Talisay River and taken to Ocean Adventure in Subic Freeport has improved amid forced feeding and treatment of its 2 wounds, said Nilo Ramoso, Biologist III, Pawikan Conservation Project.\nDr. Westly Rosario, BFAR Center chief in Dagupan City, has reported that BFAR personnel were also investigating a \u201cproblem in the water, probably chemical pollution,\u201d to explain why the dolphins beached and sought shelter in the shallow waters. The dolphins have faced the same direction and their blowholes above water, they seemed to be avoiding something. \u201cThe dolphins were behaving in the same way, they have the same action. People were trying to drive them back into the sea but they refused. There could be chemical pollution somewhere which they were avoiding,\u201d Rosario explained.\nDolphins' disorientation is sometimes caused by the changes in earth's magnetic field \u201cthat cause the dolphins\u2019 navigational mechanisms to go haywire,\u201d Dr. Edgardo Gomez, professor emeritus of the University of the Philippines Marine Science Institute, said, adding that \"it could also be chemicals in the water that affected the dolphins, although this should be proven by water tests.\" Philippine marine biologist Rizza Salinas said a possible cause for the stranding of large pods of distressed whales is that there could have been illegal dynamite fishing in the area.\n\u201cThis is very strange. What is also unusual is they appeared disoriented. I am on my way to Bataan on board BFAR\u2019s patrol vessel. We will look into the situation. Our patrol boats are also on their way to the area. We are also getting experts on stranding,\" said BFAR director Malcolm Sarmiento Jr. Sarmiento, explaining that the highest number of stranded dolphins recorded by the BFAR was only 20 to 30. \"It's something unusual. It's the first time that such a large pod has entered Manila Bay, and is acting strangely,\" Sarmiento added.\n\"Most strandings are caused by seaquakes, heat wave or disturbances at sea. Such disturbances affect the pressure underwater, which subsequently affects the dolphins\u2019 eardrums and sense of balance, leading to their \"disorientation.\" The creatures then will avoid diving in deeper parts of the ocean and will swim to shallow areas. They came from the north and were headed towards the South China Sea,\" Sarmiento explained, adding that the unusual occurrence may have also been caused when the pod could have been following a sick or injured leader.\nSarmiento has appealed to the public not to inflict harm on the dolphins, which are considered threatened species. \"Please do not harm the dolphins because they are already endangered. The authorities should also prevent the people who want to inflict harm on the creatures. They should be arrested, if needed.\" Melon-head dolphins are considered threatened species \u2014 meaning they are likely to become endangered in the future. \n\"At around 12 noon, the dolphins were finally guided to the open seas, but residents in Hermosa near Mariveles were surprised to see the dolphins near their shoreline, but around 4:30 pm, all the dolphins have left the shoreline and swam towards into deeper waters,\" said Governor Garcia.\n\"The dolphins swam parallel back to Abucay, Hermosa, and Manila Bay before they were eventually herded farther offshore. There are theories that this phenomenon was a result of the Monday night lunar eclipse. The Fisheries Bureau will know after their tests,\u201d Garcia added. \nHaving suspected the dolphins\u2019 habitat must have been disrupted, forcing them to flee and seek refuge in shallow waters, Senate of the Philippines Majority Leader, Juan Miguel Zubiri on Tuesday asked experts to probe the cause of the sudden appearance of more than 300 electra dolphins near the shores of Pilar town in Bataan province Tuesday morning.\nSenator Zubiri wanted the experts to examine the possibility that an earthquake study, involving an undersea experiment using blasting in the South China Sea by the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory (L-DEO) - a collaborator of Columbia University - caused the abnormal behavior of the small whales.\nCiting an International Union for Conservation of Nature research concluding that the melon-headed whales may have been distracted by the South China Sea study, forcing the dolphins to wander in the shallow waters, Senator Zubiri said that \u201cthe earthquake study is a sea floor investigation project in the exclusive economic zone that includes Taiwan, China, Japan and the Philippines for its earthquake research. On top of saving stranded dolphins, we should find the cause for the tragedy in order to avoid them in the future and to be prepared when it occurs again,\" he explained.\nBut according to Erlinton Olavare, Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (PHIVOLCS) science research specialist, \u201cno significant event was recorded by their stations in Bolinao, Sta. Cruz and Lubag, near Pilar at the time the dolphins were stranded Tuesday.\"\nDepartment of Environment and Natural Resources Secretary Jose L. Atienza, Jr. said Bataan Gov. Enrique \u201cTet\u201d Garcia on Wednesday confirmed there was dynamite fishing in his province. \u201cI asked him [Garcia] and he confirmed it. He also said he was battling this illegal activity,\u201d said Atienza. \u201cThe causes of the acoustic trauma could have been sound waves caused by dynamite fishing or sounds emitted by passing ships or seaquakes,\u201d Gov. Garcia said. \n\"Dolphins are a 'cohesive' group and that they follow where their leader takes them. If the leader of the dolphins was sick, then the animal could have committed a \u201cnavigational error\u201d and led the rest of the group to shore,\" said the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society (WDCS).\n\"The pod of melon-headed whales (dolphins) on Manila Bay were injured by a rather nasty group of more than 120 undersea earthquakes. The swarm started with a small magnitude-4.5 event on December 21, 2008. Things got red-hot on January 3, 2009 when a magnitude-7.6 event erupted near the water\u2019s edge on Papua Island in Indonesia, 700 miles southeast of Davao City in Mindanao. The 7.6 magnitude quake was followed by more than 120 major aftershocks each one capable by itself of inflicting injury on a pod of dolphins,\" said Capt. David Williams, a retired marine mammal researcher, a commercial sea captain for 40 years and active whale conservationist. \nCapt. Williams explained that whales and dolphins have small air sacs (pterygoid sinuses) that surround each inner ear and help then sense sound direction underwater. A damaged pterygoid air sac results in the loosing of echonavigation and echolocation. \"In summary, my Seaquake Theory indicates that barotrauma, as a result of exposure to potent earthquake-induced changes in ambient pressure, solves the centuries-old mystery of why whales and dolphins mass-strand on beaches around the world,\" Capt. Williams concluded.\nAn explosive blast and explosive decompression create a pressure wave that can induce barotrauma. The difference in pressure between internal organs and the outer surface of the body causes injuries to internal organs that contain gas, such as the lungs, gastrointestinal tract, and ear.\nAccording to the Natural History Museum experts, whale and dolphins can become confused, mis-read the Earth's magnetic fields, fear certain sounds and get lost. Since 1913, it has investigated all strandings, more than 11,000 so far, and it runs the UK Whale and Dolphin Stranding Scheme. \nNew Zealand's Project Jonah has claimed that the largest recorded beach stranding was in 1918 when 1,000 pilot whales were stranded on New Zealand's Chatham Islands. \nThe last mass beaching in the Philippines was in 1956 when around 12 sperm whales were stranded in a coastal area in Capiz, amid at least 10 yearly strandings that happened in the country involving only one or two animals that were either sick or dying.\nLast January this year, Filipino fishermen have also rescued an endangered sea cow. The fishermen aided the beached sea cow to the deep sea, according to the Worldwide Fund for Nature.\nThe Melon-headed whale (\"Peponocephala electra\"; many-toothed blackfish and electra dolphin) is a cetacean of the oceanic dolphin family (Delphinidae). As small members of the dolphin\ngroup, it is closely related to the Pygmy Killer Whale and Pilot Whale, and collectively these dolphin species are known by the common name blackfish.\nThe tender mammal can grow up to 2.7 meters (9 feet) and weigh as much as 210 kilograms (460\npounds). With black triangular \u201cmask\u201d on its face, it appears dark gray to black in color, has no discernible beak and its head is shaped like a rounded melon, thus the name. Its primary diet is squid and fish. The Melon-headed whale lives well off-shore in all the world's tropical and sub-tropical oceans. \nAt the northern fringes of its range it may also be found in the warm currents of temperate waters. Ordinarily, however, it is found beyond the continental shelf between 20\u00b0 S and 20\u00b0 N. The Melon-headed whale is widespread throughout the world's tropical waters, although not often seen by humans on account of its preference for deep water. It has been found in Ireland, Hawaii and Cebu, in the Philippines.\nAs social species, they are covered by the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 in the United States. In July 2004, between 150 and 200 melon-headed whales occupied the shallow waters of Kauai island in Hawaii for over 28 hours, after which, they were rescued and guided to deeper water. This incident may have been related to nearby United States Navy sonar exercise. \nThe International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) which includes the melon-headed whales in its Red List of threatened species said that the number of whales involved in mass stranding had increased in the last 30 years.\n\"The melon-headed whales are likely to be \u201cvulnerable\u201d to loud sounds, such as those generated by navy sonar and seismic exploration. Evidence from stranded whales also has indicated that they may have died after swallowing plastic items. It has been predicted that the whales will be affected by global climate change, but the impact is still unclear,\" the IUCN explained."}

Three people were inside the house.\nAccording to Becky Gibbons of New York State Police and Chris Collins County Executive in Erie County, New York, the total number of fatalities is 50, including 45 passengers, four crew members and a person on the ground, while a woman and daughter on the ground were injured, near the edge of farmland, about seven miles from Buffalo Niagara International Airport. \nKaren Wielinski, age 57, and her daughter, Jill, age 22 were brought to Millard Fillmore Suburban Hospital in Williamsville where they are in stable condition in the emergency room. The father, Douglas C. Wielinski, 61 died from his injuries. Two volunteer firefighters are also being treated for smoke inhalation and minor injuries. They are expected to be released later Friday morning.\nThe crew member names have been released as of 8:20 AM EST, and are listed as: Captain Marvin Renslow, First Officer Rebecca Shaw, Flight Attendant Matilda Quintero, Flight Attendant Donna Prisco, and Captain Joseph Zuffoletto who was an off-duty crew member.\nOne of the crash victims, Beverly Eckert, of Stamford, Connecticut and widow of 9/11 terror attack victim, Buffalo native, Sean Rooney, was coming home for her husband's 58th birthday celebration. Her sister, Sue Bourque noted to \"The Buffalo News\", \"We know she was on that plane and now she's with him.\" Chris Kausner has said his sister Elise, age 24, a law student, was on board the plane. \"I'm thinking about the fact that my mother has to fly home from Florida and what I'm going to tell my two sons,\" he said.\nThe plane, which was carrying over 2.5 tonnes (5,000 pounds) of fuel, impacted a residence that was completely destroyed. Amid rain and sleet, the ill-fated plane exploded into a huge orange fireball, sparking a large fire which emergency crews had to contain. Twelve houses near the crash site were evacuated.\nThe aircraft in question was on approach to land at the nearby Buffalo Niagara International Airport when it disappeared from radar.\nAccording to recordings from air traffic control, the pilot did not report any problem to approach control, and could not be contacted by the Buffalo tower after handoff. \"Can other planes see anything?\" asked the traffic controller, but no one has responded. The pilot's last comment was \"Colgan Flight 3407,\" but there were no sounds of distress. \n\"The Buffalo News\" has reported that crew members aboard the flight from Newark Airport reported mechanical problems as they approached Buffalo. Weather conditions were reported to be a wintry mix in the area, with light snow, fog, and 17 mile per hour winds.\nIn the 31-minute audio-recording there are conversations between the cockpit, air traffic control and other aircraft in the vicinity. Following take-off from Newark Airport, a female voice (pilot) in the 3407 plane's cockpit is heard informing air authorities that her aircraft was turning on approach to landing. The pilot stopped communicating at 2,300ft. \n\"This aircraft was 5 miles out, all of a sudden we have no response from that aircraft,\" the controller declares. 21 minutes and 45 seconds into the recording, the control tower informs a JetBlue Airlines: \"...apparently we have an emergency, I'll have to get back to you,\" reported \"The Daily Telegraph\".\n\"It was cold, snowing and dark but these planes are designed to fly in icy conditions. However, those conditions can be very fickle and if ice builds up on a plane it can be very difficult. At this time of year, when a pilot crashes approaching an airport that they will know well, the first thing you look at is the weather,\u201d said David Learmount, of \"Flight International\".\nContinental Airlines Inc. said Colgan Air was in the process of collecting information. \"Continental extends its deepest sympathy to the family members and loved ones of those involved in this accident. We are providing our full assistance to Colgan Air so that together we can provide as much support as possible for all concerned,\" said Larry Kellner, CEO of Continental Airlines since December 2004.\nThe Bombardier Dash 8 a 74-seat is a twin-engined, medium range, turboprop airliner.\nAccording to the Ascend Online Fleets database, Colgan, a company of about 1,100 employees has a fleet of 15 Bombardier Dash 8's, along with 3 Hawker Beechcraft 1900D and 38 Saab 340B turboprops. Flight 3407's airplane was less than one year old and had flown for only about 1,500 hours, said Kieran Daly, of the online aviation news service Air Transport Intelligence, saying that the doomed turboprop plane is one of the safest of its type.\nScandinavian Airlines (SAS) has permanently grounded its Dash 8s fleet after three crash landings during a two-month period in 2007 caused by faulty landing gear. \"Confidence in the Q400 has diminished considerably and our customers are becoming increasingly doubtful about flying in this type of aircraft,\" said Mats Jansson, SAS president and CEO. \"I have decided to immediately remove Dash 8 Q400 aircraft from service,\" he added. \n\"There is 'no indication of any security related event' that brought the plane down,\" said FBI spokesman Richard Kolko. Conditions of freezing drizzle, known as hard rime, were the most likely cause of the tragedy.\nThe National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) has announced that they would send a team to the crash site on Friday to begin the investigation. Lorenda Ward will serve as chief investigator with the assistance of NTSB Commissioner Steven Chealander and public affairs officer Keith Holloway. Ward has investigated several other plane crashes \u2014 including the 2006 New York City plane crash that claimed the life of New York Yankees pitcher Corey Lidle.\n\"We are deeply shocked and saddened by the tragic accident that occurred tonight in Clarence. Our focus right now is on supporting the first responders on the ground and their efforts to ensure the health and safety of people in the area,\" said Chris Lee, an Republican politician from Corning, New York, representing the 26th Congressional District of New York.\nThe tragedy is the nation's deadliest disaster since the Comair Flight 191 crashed in Lexington, Kentucky in August 2006. Delta Air Lines Flight 5191 was a scheduled U.S. domestic passenger flight from Lexington, Kentucky, to Atlanta, Georgia. On the morning of August 27, 2006, the Bombardier Canadair Regional Jet 100ER that was being used for the flight crashed while attempting to take off from Blue Grass Airport in Fayette County, Kentucky, four miles (6 kilometers) west of the central business district of the City of Lexington. \nFinancially, Continental is faced with volatile fuel prices amid a slowdown from the weak economy. It has posted losses of $585 million for 2008."}

A small fire was noticed in a waste bin storage area in the first class section's bar unit.\nA damaged wiring loom could be seen sticking out of a hole in the compartments floor, and there was visible electrical arcing in the area. An attempt was made to control the situation by switching off electrical circuits, but both the fire and the arcing continued unchecked.\nThe aircraft's captain declared an emergency and diverted to Shannon, which the airliner reached thirty minutes later. During that time, the crew used five 1kg fire extinguishers upon the fire, but each time the arcing continued and after about five minutes the fire reignited. Witnesses described the fire as consisting of \u201clicks of flame\u201d.\nAfter performing a safe emergency landing the airport's Aircraft Rescue and Firefighting department tackled the fire with a 5kg extinguisher but met with similar results. After consulting with the crew the jet's power was completely shut down, after which the fire was finally put out. Virgin initially claimed the fire had never occurred.\nInvestigators with Ireland's Air Accident Investigation Unit (AAIU) inspected the loom and found it to be \u201ccompletely severed\u201d and exhibiting \u201cstrong evidence of burning/arcing\u201d according to a preliminary report released on Friday. The loom was identified as providing power and dimming circuits for mood lighting in the bar.\nThe AAIU says that it seems the loom had contacted the metal waste bin in the compartment above. There should have been rails to hold up the bin and a protective metal cover, but \u201cno evidence\u201d of these was found and the report notes that \u201cInitial inspection indicated the possibility that they were never fitted.\u201d\nThe bar unit is a modification exclusive to Virgin. The AAIU ordered all 36 of the airline's A340s worldwide inspected, with both France and the United Kingdom assisting with this. The UK has identified four other aircraft with faulty wiring, it has now been revealed. Virgin says that \u201cA few minor issues were found and were immediately rectified,\u201d and adds that \u201cThe installation of the bar was carried out in accordance with all relevant regulations. Virgin Atlantic continues to assist the AAIU in their investigation and looks forward to the full report with interest.\u201d\nThe AAIU says that \"significant other issues are being examined by the investigation\" in addition to the wiring defects. \u201cThese include the difficulties faced by the crew in isolating the damaged circuits, the emergency checklist, the design of the modification and the standards relating to such modifications,\u201d said the report.\nVirgin's Boeing 747-400 fleet also has a similar bar installed on it, but there was not considered to be a risk to the aircraft's wiring on that model. The fire involved a bar added three years ago, with the aircraft manufactured in 1998.\nExternal links.\n "}

Only three Republican senators voted for the measure. Shortly before the Senate vote, the US House of Representatives approved of the stimulus by a margin of 246\u2013183, with all 176 Republicans and seven Democrats voting against the bill.\nThe Senate vote was delayed until night so that Democratic Senator could fly back from Ohio, where his mother had recently died. He cast the final and decisive sixtieth vote in favor of the stimulus bill.\n Barack Obama is expected to sign the bill into law in , Colorado on Tuesday, February 17.\n\"This is a major milestone on our road to recovery, and I want to thank the members of Congress who came together in common purpose to make it happen,\" Obama said in his weekly address. \"I will sign this legislation into law shortly, and we'll begin making the immediate investments necessary to put people back to work doing the work America needs done. This historic step won't be the end of what we do to turn our economy around, but the beginning.\"\n64% of the stimulus package is intended for spending and money for social programmes, while another 34% is devoted to tax cuts. The plan also limits cash bonuses and incentive compensations for Wall Street executives. Over $48 billion of the stimulus has been reserved for transportation projects, such as high-speed rail, road, and bridge construction. Tens of billions more will be used for funding states to prevent any cuts that they would otherwise be forced to make to aid local governments and schools.\nDemocrats say that the plan will help create three and a half million jobs, and that the plan's tax cuts will help 95% of all US residents, mainly with the use of $800 breaks for couples and $400 for individuals. Those who do not earn enough money to pay income taxes will also be eligible for the breaks. Additionally, breaks will be given to first-time homebuyers and car buyers, in an effort to give a boost to two industries badly affected by the recession.\nSenate Majority leader Harry Reid said that the stimulus package was the most important legislation that he had ever worked on. \"The country is in trouble and we're so fortunate we were able to get it passed. It's going to give this country a shot in the arm.\"\nOthers, however, such as Senate Minority leader , are highly critical of the plan. \"This isn't Monopoly money. It's real.

Anne Marie David, from Arles in the south of France, parlayed her initial success from playing Mary Magdalene in the French production of \"Jesus Christ Superstar\" into taking home the \"grand prix\" at the Eurovision Song Contest in 1973. Her winning song, \"Tu te reconna\u00eetras\" (\"You will recognize yourself\"), became a Europe-wide hit that spring.\nAt the height of her popularity, David perfomed world tours, and even lived abroad in Turkey for a time. In 1979, she tried once again to win the Eurovision, and placed a respectable third. Her song \"Je suis l'enfant soleil\" (\"I'm a child of the sun\") became similarly popular across France and in the Francophone nations.\nAs time went on, however, her place in the French music scene became less certain. Touring the world had taken a personal toll, and David decided to retire from music completely in 1987. However, with the help of her fan base, she was coaxed out of retirement in 2003 and is returning to a part of her life that she tried to leave, but never left her. Celebrating four decades in the music scene, David is looking forward to adventurous new projects and a newfound zest for life.\nAnne Marie David corresponded with \"Wikinews\"' about her eventful career, her personal anecdotes regarding living abroad, her successes in past Eurovision contests and her grievances with the way the show is produced today. This is the second in a series of interviews with past Eurovision contestants, which will be published sporadically in the lead-up to mid-May's next contest in Moscow.\nEarly career.\n I saw the photos on your website, and I must say, you hardly look older than when you did Eurovision 30 years ago. Has anyone told you that back then, you looked a lot like Marie Osmond?\nAnne Marie David: Thank you for the compliment, but I don't recall anyone alluding to a resemblance with Marie Osmond. I would have taken that as a compliment, no?\n When did you first start singing? Who were your musical inspirations while you were growing up?\nAMD: I was already singing as a young child; my mother said that when she was pregnant with me, she sang lullabies to me... My [own] musical culture is very large. At home we listened to a lot of opera and operettas, but also French \"vari\u00e9t\u00e9\" or the accordion. But my big revelation was my discovery of Barbra Streisand in \"Funny Girl\". That changed everything for me... I absolutely wanted to approach [the level of] this great artist, the greatest in my opinion, and try to pull myself to the heights of her talent. Not by imitating her, but by succeeding in acquiring this vocal perfection she possesses, and by orienting all my efforts towards the acting that I could present by interpreting my songs whenever the [lyrics] allowed me to.\n\"' You became very well-known in 1972 when you played Mary Magdalene in \"Jesus Christ Superstar\". How did you get the part? If you had to audition, what were the auditions like, and were you nervous?\nAMD: At the time I played in the musical comedy \"The Me Nobody Knows,\" originating from the United States. Unfortunately the promotion for this presentation was not excellent and it remained confidential. My artistic director at the time, Pierre Hebrard, knew that the casting of \"Jesus Christ Superstar\" was finished but that the role of Mary Magdalene had not yet been definitively [cast]. He asked the production [company] to audition me. I practiced the beginning of the song for a quarter of an hour with Anthony Bowles, the musical director, then I sang the song. They asked me to learn the entire song for the next morning, and to come back to sing it. I did so... I sang the song the next day and in the end, they said OK, we'll take you... I learned that for this role the production auditioned 600 girls! I was stressed out \"after\" the audition... when I realized the challenge. Before I had not been very relaxed [or] comfortable, but I mostly wanted to [sell the song]... The show must go on, no?\n You're from the south of France, and some of the French Wikipedians remarked, \"But she doesn't have any accent when she's singing!\" Did you have to take vocal classes or was it natural for you to sing without an accent?\nAMD: I'm a big fan of accent imitations... accents are also music, and in private I often tell jokes with accents. It's the actress in me... but in fact singing in French for me is singing without an accent; it's a natural thing... I make no particular effort [to remove an accent].\n\"' After your success in the theatre, you were victorious at Eurovision in 1973. Luxembourg usually selected their entrants internally, so how did RTL [\"Editor's note: The state broadcaster of Luxembourg\"] become aware of you? How were you approached by them, and did you ever consider not participating in the Contest?\nAMD: I had the opportunity to have the director of programs and the director of special programming for RTL [watching me] the night of the premiere of \"Jesus Christ Superstar\". They saw me and were enthused by my performance. When they asked me that night if I would accept to represent Luxembourg in 1973, I only asked if it wasn't a problem [for them because] they'd won with Vicky L\u00e9andros that year (1972). They told me no, that for them winning several times in a row was not a problem... so I said \"yes\" with \"pleasure\"!\nEurovision '73 and initial mainstream success.\n When you competed for Luxembourg, one country winning twice in a row was still rare. Was there a lot of pressure for you to win the grand prize for Luxembourg? Did you also feel pressure to succeed from yourself?\nAMD: There was no need to win the grand \"prize\" except in \"my head\". I felt sure that an opportunity like that one was \"unique\" and that I would not have it a second time... I was incorrect... I got it twice! What I mean to say is that Eurovision remains for me a musical contest before all else, although of course a good song is worth nothing without a good [singer]. Thus the need to have both!\nI've always had a taste for challenges... Eurovision is one. And among the challenges I like the competition, so when challenge and competition are combined, I think only of victory. I think it would be ridiculous and useless to go to Eurovision without wanting to win! I never participate in a contest, or anywhere for that matter, when it consists of singing with a tourist view of it. I prioritize my work and the result of my work. This has not allowed me to visit many things in all the countries where I have been in competition, but this allowed me to never find myself poorly ranked or last. One must know whether one wants victory or tourism...and I think it's a lack of respect to all those who count on us, and all those who spend a lot [of time] (production, television, etc...) to not take every chance to rank better or not put every chance of winning on our side.\n You ended up in a three-way dead heat between Mocedades from Spain and Cliff Richard from the United Kingdom, who both performed songs some fans also consider worthy of the grand prize. What were your opinions of those songs? If, hypothetically, your song didn't win, do you think either of them were strong enough to be winner material?\nAMD: 1973 was a year very rich in quality candidates... the proof: victory came to me with just a very few points ahead. The ranking of that year's other candidates was what I dreaded most. Mocedades was a pure moment of happiness and of a formidable effectiveness; Cliff Richard benefited from an exceptional notoriety and a mastery of the scene that I was far from having; so I needed to play everything I had... but I told you that I'd chosen \"victory\", not tourism!\n During the mid-1970s, you did many tours of Turkey and the Middle East, and won reporters' music awards there. What was the best thing you liked about being in Turkey? What experiences did you have that really stand out in your mind even today?\nAMD: I had the immense joy of working a lot of time and also living over there, and for me it was the discovery of an immense culture, well beyond what I could have imagined. It was an encounter with a people, the Turkish people, whom we don't make the effort to know in depth. Most of the time there are too many clich\u00e9s that are in no way reflections of what these people truly are... I am not talking about the leaders, I'm talking about the citizens of a country. I learned about them, to understand them, to exchange with them, in all their diversity, and God knows that in matters of diversity Turkey knows what it's talking about. I spent rare moments there surrounded by Turks, Armenians, Greeks, and Jews sitting at the same table and speaking the same language, the language of love and friendship... In all the whole world it's the same thing. All is well except when politics or religion intervene.\nEurovision '79.\n In 1979, you decided to compete for a spot at the Eurovision final again, this time for France. Why did you want to go back a second time? Considering your past success, were you fairly confident that you would end up being the French representative that year?\nAMD: It was a taste for risk that guided me, but a measured risk, because 'Winner of the Grand Eurovision Prize 1973' is a lifetime title that one does not risk losing if one takes another chance. The place [you received] remains [that] place. When I accepted [the opportunity] to try representing France in 1979, I knew that the rules of the game were different than the ones in Luxembourg. Winner [from] 1973 or not, it didn't change [things] much since one needed to pass through a selection process. I played the game like everyone else and it was the public who voted for the 12 semi-finalists. Unfortunately television was on strike, and the finale could not be held as planned. The 12 semi-finalists were therefore viewed by a jury of professionals, and I was retained. But I respected the rule all the way to the end, and above all French television \"never\" modified the rule until the final candidate selection. I would have appreciated that France 3 [\"Editor's note: The current television station broadcasting Eurovision in France\"] respects the rule of the game the same way this year... and that \"all\" the candidates win or lose in loyal fashion, by respecting the rule. This will not be the case and I regret that... [\"Editor's note: After decades of public voting to select France's finalist, France 3 selected their artist internally this year despite originally calling for finalists.\"]\n Competing at the Eurovision in 1979, you ended the voting on the wrong end of a close three-way finish, being beaten by the songs from Israel and Spain. Considering your victory helped Luxembourg win twice in a row, were you happy for Israel as they also achieved the same feat? \nAMD: Of course! It's once again a rule fixed ahead of time, and which does not prohibit a country from winning several times in a row.\n Many Eurovision fans on sites like YouTube feel the 1979 Contest was one of the strongest years ever for Eurovision. Apart from your own song, were there any songs you remember that you really liked? Also, which song do you feel was a stronger entry, \"Je suis l'enfant soleil\" or \"Tu te reconna\u00eetras\"?\nAMD: I have indeed seen how much Internet users appreciate \"Je suis l'enfant soleil\"... let them be reassured, so do I! That year, in 1979, I particularly liked Milk and Honey and Gali Atari who won, and the German group who sang \"Dschinghis Khan\", which was a very strong title and sold well. With time, singing my songs from Eurovision continue to give me pleasure. \"Je suis l'enfant soleil\" tells a very beautiful tale and allows me to play comedy [\"Editor's note: \"Comedy\" in the theatrical sense, aiming to denounce the faults and vices of society using humor\"] a lot. But I adore \"Tu te reconna\u00eetras\" for what it has in singing, pulling in, being direct with the audience. In fact, each [song] brings me something different and to the public as well.\n1980s: Retirement.\n During the 1980s, you competed in some more song festivals, including one in Norway and one in Chile. Anabela, the 1993 entrant from Portugal, felt she was eventually typecast as being \"the song festival girl.\" Did you ever feel restricted in the same way? Were there ever any other facets to your musical repertoire that you would have liked to explore?\nAMD: I always assumed the image of a competitor, maybe because I grew up in a place where I was very happy, but where we were not very rich; so I always had to make choices and needed to earn each thing that life gave me. Also, it's great to know that others count on you and think that you can bring them a victory; it's not given to everyone. As for the facets of my personality, for a long time I had to struggle (again!) against a face which refused to age, and which thus prevented me from being credible in certain repertoires. \nToday time has passed, I am totally free in my choices, my voice has ripened well, and my silhouette too, my mastery of the scene is much more elaborated and thus I take on all the styles if the song touches or pleases me. And also I take on challenges like the song which I recorded with Jean Renard, [called] \"Federico\" which is totally \"gypsy\" and totally unlike my usual image. I am currently preparing a song for my English[-language] dance floor album (yep!) which is being [released] by Energise Records. [Dance music] is totally the opposite of what I do... but that amuses me and also the producers convinced me that I'd be great in it... so I hope not to disappoint them. [Here's a] scoop: it's called \"You Came to Me.\"\n In the late 1980s, you retired from music completely. Was this a difficult decision for you to make? What things did you want out of your life which required you to leave music? Where did you go, and what did you do in retirement?\nAMD: Nothing is ever difficult when we accept to assume our choice. Those years were very disco, we were entering terrains I wasn't ready to tread, and I had been spoiled by my artist's life by going ever farther and farther from home. The French media ignored me after my victory for Luxembourg. Everyone wanted a second \"Tu te reconna\u00eetras\" and that is impossible. \nAnd so I went where the public awaited me, by changing countries nearly daily, and this tired me. I told myself that my life was not made \"only\" of songs and glory, and that I was passionate [about] many other things. I would have had to sacrifice far too many things and people to recover a place in France, like going to live in France, living a life of popularity, etc... I told myself that I had already been spoiled, so I said \"stop!\" in 1987 after the [Song] Festival in Chile. I participated in [many] great projects [revolving] around the Lusitanian horses and the fighting bulls which I raised with passion and love, but [my] life [eventually] did not follow those paths... maybe because \"my\" life is the stage and \"life\" took charge [and reminded] me of that...\nReturn to music.\n You came out of retirement five years ago. How often did you think about returning to music while in retirement? Was music something you felt you couldn't just \"let go\"?\nAMD: When I decide to do something, I do it. When I decide to stop something, I do that too. But that isn't taking into account that there are things which we want to do, and those which life decides for us! In 1987, I vowed never to return to the stage, but as I said, life sometimes serves you dishes that you didn't choose, and in 2003 it's chance that made me return to the stage, and it's my fans whom I never imagined [I had] in such numbers and whom, so many years later, had conserved their love, which made me stay. I owe them a lot and will never forget that.\n Tell us about the CDs you have released since coming out of retirement. Are you experimenting with any new musical styles? I read you had a lot of input into your CD \"Federico\"; describe the direction you wanted to pursue with that disc.\nAMD: It's thanks to the fans from my fan club that I could create a live CD, which I titled \"Live \u00e0 Charleroi\" (Live at Charleroi). They sent me money via my fan club to allow me to be at the concert, and they bought my CD in advance even before it existed. [All of this was] just to help me, just to show me how much they wanted to find me [on stage] again [for that moment], in the space of 14 songs with a simple piano. \nFor \"Federico\" it's Jean Renard who had the idea. [It was] a task which was totally unlike [anything in] my experience, but he trusted me and I trusted him. I don't regret it. There is a little bit of me in \"Federico.\" I have Iberian origins from my mother, and furthermore this allowed me to write two songs in Spanish. Nothing but happiness!\n What new projects will you be doing in 2009? Are you doing any concerts?\nAMD: Yes, I will be in some concerts but this time as an artisan. I will co-produce a large portion of them; I'm preparing an album of twelve new songs for 2010... and after if God wills it I'll celebrate my 40 years in [music] at Olympia if it's possible. I also continue [on] as a coach and the artistic director of the group \"Caprice\" ([who are] three of my students), who had hoped to represent France at Eurovision 2009, but whom France 3 discarded from the game in a pretty dishonest way (along with all the others, for that matter). They will record other songs this year and I'm sure they'll do great. I like talent and they have it. I already partially explained my point of view on the subject in my response to [an earlier question regarding the representative at Eurovision 2009].\nViews about Eurovision today.\n In the past ten years or so, public interest in Eurovision has dwindled somewhat in France, a trend that has already been seen in countries like the Netherlands and Germany. Why do you feel that is? Is there anything France, or perhaps France T\u00e9l\u00e9visions, can do to get French people watching the Contest again, especially in a television landscape populated by reality television?\nAMD: The only solution would be to stop changing a game rule that has proven itself for years, not [to] mix the genres, [to] return to the fundamentals. Eurovision is a contest of songs, not of stars, or [a] dance floor, or \"Top Model\"... If this type of manifestation, which pleases the [current viewing] base had not been derived, all those who loved Eurovision would watch it still. \nBut the system of votes by SMS developed the youths' votes, against whom I bear no ill but few adults play that game (my grandmother or mother will never vote that way). To put the spotlight favourably on the operators who that night will swipe the wealth [\"Editor's note: A reference to Pactolus, in which King Midas washed his hands of the golden touch in the river there\"], they prefer to take from it an evening which was an international family party... And tell yourself that any economic power who wants to make his candidate win can afford the luxury of buying millions of portable cell phones, distribute them with unlimited plans for a night to kids who could not afford them and win! Anyway, when I say \"win\", [it nowadays] implies not really winning! \nAs for the jury, it must stay visible. Previously, each country sent its two judges and during the contest were kept apart from everyone... Tricking votes would be seen on the screens the night of the Contest and thus it almost never happened. What a strange idea also to distinguish between countries which are qualified for [the final] and the others! It's a total injustice. \nYou see [Eurovision today] is not neutral, and don't [anyone] tell me that it's reasoning from a different age... It's just a series of observations... Nobody can contest the fact that certain generations who were the success of Eurovision no longer find their satisfaction in it and are therefore disinterested. Nobody can contest, also, that for decades the great Eurovision [winners] were international hits that everyone still sings today. Who today is capable of singing the titles which win? And what will remain of [the contest] in the future?\n\"' Some viewers were not happy about last year's entrant, S\u00e9bastien Tellier. Singing his entry in essentially \"franglais,\" [\"Editor's note: A mix of words and sentences interchanged between French and English\"] even a member of Parliament demanded that the next entry be purely in French. How did you feel about Tellier's performance, and do you feel every French entry must be sung in French? Do you feel not singing in English hinders France as an entrant in today's contest?\nAMD: Once again, I think we must return to the fundamentals. Turn the problem however you'd like but in the end you will arrive at the same conclusions. Germany won in German, Spain won in Spanish, Holland won in Dutch, Norway won in Norwegian, etc... What else? \nI see no reason to abandon everything to English; anyway I will fight that it not be the case with French! I sing in English, I speak English, I love the language of Shakespeare, but if I must represent my country in an international contest, I want to do it in French, and I also want it to be done in French. It's not an issue of chauvinism, it's an issue of respect with regards to all those who paid with their blood so that France is a full nation. It's the same for the national anthem of my country. And I would have the same reasoning whatever my nationality. I was born under the sun of France, it's normal that I love that sun.\n In our first Eurovision interview, we asked the 1982 winner, Nicole, how she felt about the alleged \"bloc voting\" taking place between the nations of eastern Europe. She replied, \"The eastern European countries obviously support each other with the so-called 'bloc voting.' It's now a political affair and no longer a 'song contest.'\" Do you feel that way as well? What exactly are your feelings about the results from the past few years, which place countries like France, the United Kingdom and Germany at the bottom nearly every time?\nAMD: You already have my analysis of the problem in my responses to [the last two questions]; but Nicole is right, she is defending her country and I find that very respectable. It's what is lacking today: people who have nothing to sell and who say what they think without being part of a political machine. Thank you, Nicole.\n Do you ever see yourself returning to the Eurovision stage as the representative from France or any of the francophone nations?\nAMD: I've been asked several times, including in 2009, to represent my country once more at Eurovision. But I've said and I repeat, it's not the place of confirmed artists to take that of young artists who need this springboard to be known by more people. And it is not the fear of losing my title of winner. I acquired it definitively for 1973, and I ranked third in 1979. Never can anything nor anyone change that. I prefer my position as coach, adviser... it's magnificent to rediscover one's twenties through someone who is 20, no? My emotions are unchanged... [I still get] the fear and stage fright as well, so can I ask for anything else [at this point]?\n Will you be a part of the French delegation going to Moscow this year? If no decision has been made yet, would you like to go?\nAMD: Too many things separate me from the French selection for 2009, which the essential [grievance] rests on the contempt of respect for the given word, contempt for the respect of the written word, transgressed precisely by those who have a duty and mission to ensure that [such rules] are not [transgressed]. Moreover I think that all the places in the delegation are reserved and distributed in advance based on a procedure that escapes me... I have nothing to add.\n In closing, what would you like to say to all of your fans who have followed your career these past four decades?\nAMD: Yes, I would like to simply say \"thank you\" and see you very soon to continue our beautiful love story.\nSource.\n __NOEDITSECTION__"}

Shares in SP AusNet closed 3.7 percent lower at A$1.045 on Monday.\nPower supplier SP AusNet said it has asked the Victoria Court regarding the status of the class action proceedings saying the firm had insurance policies in place consistent with industry standards. \"SP AusNet will continue to update the market as further information becomes available,\" the company said.\nThe claim has focused on alleged negligence by SP AusNet in its management of electricity infrastructure. It maintains most of the power lines in eastern Victoria. Its fallen power line is believed to have sparked the blaze that tore through Kinglake, Steels Creek, Strathewen, Humevale, and St Andrews. The plaintiffs include thousands of angry Kinglake farmers, small business owners, tourist operators and residents who lost homes.\nLeo Keane, the lead plaintiff in the class action has alleged \"SP AusNet owed a duty of care to landowners to operate and manage power lines in a way that limited the risk of damage from bushfires.\"\nOn Thursday Phoenix Taskforce had taken away a section of power line as well as a power pole from near Kilmore East, part of a two-kilometre section of line in Kilmore East that fell during strong winds and record heat about 11am last Saturday. It was believed to have started the fire there, since within minutes a nearby pine forest was ablaze, and within six hours the bushfire had almost obliterated nearly every building in the towns in its path.\n\"It is believed that the claim will be made on the basis of negligent management of power lines and infrastructure,\" Slidders Lawyers partner Daniel Oldham said. The law firm has announced it was helping landowners and leaseholders get compensation for the 2003, 2006, 2007 and 2009 bushfires. \"If you have been burnt by the recent bushfires, please register your interest using the form below as soon as possible,\" the law firm's website stated.\nThe Insurance Council of Australia has placed the cost of the bushfires at about $500 million. \"That means keeping electricity lines clear of trees and in a condition that won't cause fires. They must also have systems in place to identify and prevent risks occurring,\" Melbourne barrister Tim Tobin, QC, said. According to the 2006 census, Kinglake had a population of almost 1,500 people. \nBut SP AusNet's legal liability has been limited at $100 million under an agreement inked by the former Kennett government with private utility operators, when the former State Electricity Commission was privatized in 1995. Accordingly, the Brumby Government could be legally obliged to pay damages of the differences amounting to hundreds of millions of dollars.\nSP AusNet Ltd said some of its electricity assets have been damaged by the Victoria bushfire. \"As a preliminary estimate, it is thought that damage has been sustained to approximately one per cent of SP AusNet\u2019s electricity distribution network, mainly distribution poles, associated conductors and pole top transformers,\" SP AusNet said in a statement to the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX). It explained that up to 6,000 homes and businesses on its network were without power due to bushfires, including the Kinglake complex fire, Beechworth fire, and fires across Gippsland including Churchill and Bunyip.\nSP AusNet said the firm will cooperate fully and will assist in any fire probe. \"We stand ready to assist the relevant authorities with their inquiries if it is necessary for us to do so now and in the coming months,\" SP Ausnet spokeswoman Louisa Graham said in a statement. \n\"Our priority is to restore power to fire-affected areas as quickly as possible. We believe the claim is premature and inappropriate ... SP AusNet will vigorously defend the claim. If the claim is pursued, SP AusNet advises that it has liability insurance which provides cover for bushfire liability. The company's bushfire mitigation and vegetation management programmes comply with state regulations and were audited annually by state agencies,\" Grahams explained.\nVictorian Auditor-General Rob Hulls said \"there was an 'unseemly rush' by some lawyers to sue before the cause of the fires had been fully investigated.\" \n\"The government body had audited the network's bushfire risk to make sure required distances between power lines and vegetation were maintained. Power companies had been given a clean bill of health, and electricity firms were judged to be 'well prepared for the 2008-09 bushfire season.' There were no regulations applying to the distances between poles supporting electricity lines and spans of one kilometre were not unusual,\" a spokesman for Energy Safe Victoria explained.\nChristine Nixon, the 19th and current Chief Commissioner of Victoria Police said investigations into the cause of the bushfires were ongoing. \"I know people are angry, and so are all of us in this community. But we need to kind of have a sense that the proper processes are in place and we need to go through the investigation and through the court case,\" Nixon said. \"At this stage we are not able to confirm how it started. I understand there is some legal action that people are taking, but at this stage we're still investigating its cause. But the whole circumstances of that fire are part of our Taskforce Phoenix, and as we move through that we'll be able to tell the community more once we're able to confirm or deny what we think is the cause of these fires,\" Nixon added.\nOn Thursday, two people were arrested in connection with the fires, having been observed by members of the public acting suspiciously in areas between Yea and Seymour; although they were both released without charges laid. \nBrendan Sokaluk, age 39, from Churchill in the Gippsland region, was arrested by police at 4pm on Thursday, in relation to the Churchill fires, and was questioned at the Morwell police station. He was charged on Friday with one count each of arson, intentionally lighting a bushfire and possession of child pornography. The arson case relates to 11 of the 21 deaths in the dire Gippsland fire, which devastated 39,000 hectares in the Latrobe Valley, Calignee, Hazelwood Koornalla and Jeeralang. Two teams of Churchill firefighters were almost lost in the inferno that remains out of control.\nMr Sokaluk joined the CFA Churchill brigade in the late 1980s as a volunteer fire fighter, left in the 1990s and attempted to rejoin twice, but was rejected. He failed to appear in Melbourne Magistrate's Court Monday for a scheduled hearing, since the court reset the committal hearing on May 25. He is represented by lawyer Julian McMahon.\nMagistrate John Klestadt has lifted the suppression order which kept the suspect's identity a secret but identifying photographs were barred from being released. Mr Sokaluk was remanded in protective custody from Morwell to a cell in Melbourne for his own safety amid fears angry prisoners will target him and real risk of vigilante attacks. He faces a maximum sentence of 25 years imprisonment if convicted on the arson charge. \n\"This is an extraordinary case. The level of emotion and anger and disgust that the alleged offenses have aroused in the community is unprecedented.\" Mr Sokaluk's defense lawyer Helen Spowart argued. The prosecution has moved the Court for more time to prepare its case, saying there would be up to 200 witnesses to interview. \nSlater &amp; Gordon has indicated that they were awaiting the report of the to-be-established Royal Commission, expected in late 2010, before initiating any claims.\nArmed with a $40 million budget, the Royal Commission's Chair Justice Bernard Teague will be assisted by former Commonwealth ombudsman Ron McLeod, who led the inquiry into the 2003 Canberra bushfires, and State Services Authority Commissioner Susan Pascoe. The Commission has said its interim report is due on August 17 while the final report will be submitted by July 31, 2010.\nJudge Bernard Teague has announced Tuesday he will meet with fire victims and fire authorities within the next two weeks. \"We want to do that as soon as possible - probably not next week but starting to have these discussions the week after,\" he said.\nJulia Eileen Gillard, the Deputy Prime Minister of Australia and deputy leader of the federal Australian Labor Party (ALP) said the federal and Victorian governments would respond quickly to the royal commission's report. \"Everybody who has lived through this experience in Victoria and around the nation has asked the question: 'Why? What can we do better?'. No one wanted to see the report \"as a book on a shelf gathering dust,\" she said.\nVictoria bushfire experts, led by Forest Fire Victoria - a group of scientists and forestry experts - have condemned the government's \"Living with Fire\" policy and the state's failure to initiate serious fuel-reduction programs. The Victoria government had failed to seriously act on bushfire safety recommendations submitted last June by the Victorian Parliamentary Environment and Natural Resources Committee.\nAs death toll rises, evidence mounts of lack of planning prior to Australia\u2019s worst bushfire. \"Living with Fire\" policy means Kinglake fire trucks were dispatched to an earlier fire in Kilmore, leaving Kinglake undefended. \"Kinglake was left with no fire brigade and no police. The trucks had been sent to Kilmore. I've been in the fire brigade for 10 years. There was always a law\u2014the trucks had to be on the hill. Because of the government we got gutted at Kinglake. They should have been getting generators ahead of the fire\u2014so people would have had a chance of fighting it. As soon as the power went, I couldn't keep fighting the fire at my place,\" Rick and Lauren Watts, and their friend Neil Rao, spoke to the WSWS.\nRick has also criticized the lack of early warning communications systems, since emergency siren warnings in the town had been stopped some years earlier. Humevale resident Sina Imbriano who has six children was angry about the failure of state and federal governments to set up a recommended telephone warning system amid its \"stay and defend or go\" policy. Bald Spur Road residents Greg Jackson and his wife Fotini said the government's \"stay and defend or go\" policy was \"fruitless\" since the critical issue was early warnings, but \"they [the government] just won't spend the money.\" \nAlso on Friday, five law firms from Victoria's Western Districts, including Warrnambool-based Maddens Lawyers and Brown &amp; Proudfoot, held a meeting to discuss a potential class action in relation to the Horsham fire, which was also thought to have been started by fallen power pole that burnt vast swathes of land in Mudgegonga and Dederang, Victoria. The lawsuit will also focus on the fire that blackened about 1750 hectares at Coleraine.\nMaddens senior attorney Brendan Pendergast said: \"We don't know who the defendant is at this stage. We are unsure who the electrical supplier is for that area but we should know in a few days. There were people who had their homes burnt to the ground and they will need to reconstruct, replace their contents,\" he said. Maddens has initiated a register of affected landowners for the recent bushfires, saying the firm has included victims of the Pomborneit fire that burnt almost 1300 hectares in the proposed class action amid the CFA's statement the blaze could have been deliberately lit. \nFrances Esther \"Fran\" Bailey, Liberal member of the Australian House of Representatives (1990-93 and 1996-present), representing the electorate of McEwen in Victoria said the Country Fire Authority (CFA) had told her one of the power lines had broken before the fire. \n\"The local CFA [Country Fire Authority] told me on that Saturday, with those very high winds, one of the lines had broken and was whipping against the ground and sparked,\" she said. \"Whether or not that is the cause of that terrible fire that actually took out Kinglake and maybe Marysville, the investigations will prove that, but we've got to do better,\" she added.\nVictorian Premier John Brumby said the power line claim would be examined as part of the Royal Commission into the bushfire. \"No stone will be left unturned. So, I think it's important the Royal Commission does its work. And, the Royal Commission will, of course, look at all of the factors with the fires,\" Mr Brumby said. At least 550 houses were incinerated and 100 people have been killed, leaving more than 1,000 homeless in the Kinglake bushfire and surrounding areas.\nSP AusNet - Singapore Power International Pte Ltd is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Singapore Power Limited (51% interest in SP AusNet). SP AusNet's electricity transmission and distribution networks, along with the gas distribution assets, enable it to deliver a full range of energy-related products and services to industrial and domestic customers in Victoria, Australia.\nSingapore Power ( \u65b0\u52a0\u5761\u80fd\u6e90\u6709\u9650\u516c\u53f8) is a company which provides electricity and gas transmission, distribution services, and market support services to more than a million customers in Singapore. As the only electricity company in Singapore, and also one of its largest corporation, SP was incorporated as a commercial entity in October 1995 to take over the electricity and gas businesses of the state provider, the Public Utilities Board. Since 1995, Temasek Holdings controls the entire company with a 100% stake. SP is involved in a major investment in Australia's Alinta in partnership with Babcock &amp; Brown, after putting up a bid of A$13.9 billion (S$17 billion), beating out a rival bid by Macquarie Bank.\nThe devastating 2009 Victorian Black Saturday bushfires, a series of more than 400 bushfires across Victoria on February 7 2009, is Australia's worst-ever bushfire disaster, claiming at least 200 deaths, including many young children, and is expected to pass 300. 100 victims have been admitted to hospitals across Victoria with burns, at least 20 in a critical condition, and 9 on life support or in intensive care. The fires have destroyed at least 1,834 homes and damaged many thousands more. Many towns north-east of Melbourne have been badly damaged or almost completely destroyed, including Kinglake, Marysville, Narbethong, Strathewen and Flowerdale. Over 500 people suffered fire-related injuries and more than 7,000 are homeless. It has scorched more than 1,500 square miles (3,900 square kilometers) of farms, forests and towns.\nThe Supreme Court of Victoria is the superior court for the State of Victoria, Australia. Founded in 1852, it is a superior court of common law and equity, with unlimited jurisdiction within the state. Those courts lying below it include the County Court of Victoria, the Magistrates' Court of Victoria and the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal (which is technically not a court, but serves a judicial function). Above it lies the High Court of Australia. This places it around the middle of the Australian court hierarchy. "}

Five days after the collision, reports have surfaced that burning debris from the collision has been spotted over several U.S. cities from New Mexico to Kentucky.\nCalls to 9-1-1 began to come in to Williamson County, Texas sheriff's office around 12:30 p.m. (CT) that burning debris and fireballs were seen falling from the sky onto parts of Austin, Houston, Waco and San Antonio. Residents reported their homes and windows shaking and large explosions. After a search of several areas, the Williamson county sheriff's office reported that no debris or impact sites were found. Earlier unconfirmed reports had said the debris could have been the result of a small plane exploding. \nSteve Thornton, a resident in Austin told KEYE-TV that he \"saw something burn up in the atmosphere going east to west at 40 degrees in the horizon looking north\" which was \"about the size of a half moon and as bright as a welders torch\". Other residents reported to KEYE-TV that they saw an \"egg-shape with an orange center and bluish outer aura; a silvery-white tail.\" Some report the incident lasting about 10 minutes.\nOn February 13, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) issued an alert following reports of \"explosions and earthquakes\" along with \"flashes in the sky\" in Jackson and Louisville, Kentucky. There were no injures and authorities could not locate any damage.\n\"The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) reported to local law enforcement on Friday that these events are being caused by falling satellite debris. These pieces of debris have been causing sonic booms, resulting in vibrations felt by some residents, as well as flashes of light across the sky,\" said the NOAA in a public information statement on February 13. The FAA also warns that the debris could cause damage to aircraft in areas reporting falling debris.\n\"Aircraft are advised that a potential hazard may occur due to reentry of satellite debris into the Earth's atmosphere. It is critical that all pilots/crew members report any observed falling space debris,\" said the FAA on February 13. Both the NOAA and FAA alerts are in place until further notice and cover an area from New Mexico to Kentucky.\nHowever, Dr. Marco Ciocca, a professor at Eastern Kentucky University told WKYT in Kentucky it would \"be months\" before any of the satellite wreckage enters the Earth's atmosphere. \"The debris doesn't simply fall out of its orbit. It will either vaporize or stay in orbit for some time before falling into Earth's atmosphere.\" \nThe satellites, both of which weighed in excess of 1,000 pounds, and traveling at approximately 17,500 miles per hour, collided 491 miles above the Earth. Scientists say the explosion caused by the collision was massive. They are still trying to determine just how large the crash was and how the Earth will be affected. The United States Strategic Command of the U.S. Department of Defense office is tracking the debris. The result of plotting analysis will be posted to a public website."}

It went down at approximately 10:17 p.m. EST (03:20 UTC), February 12. 44 passengers, an off-duty pilot, and four crew members died in the accident, as well as one person on the ground.\nWhen the plane crashed, it was carrying over 2.5 tonnes (5,000 pounds) of fuel. Amid rain and sleet, the aircraft exploded into a huge orange fireball, sparking a large fire which emergency crews had to contain. Twelve houses near the crash site were evacuated.\nSteve Chealander, an investigator for the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), said that the company which operated the flight suggests the pilot to fly manually when conditions are icy, saying that \"you may be able in a manual mode to sense something sooner than the autopilot can sense it.\"\n\"If the autopilot is left on while the ice is building up, the pilot may suddenly be confronted with a very difficult situation,\" said William Voss, president of the Flight Safety Foundation, speaking to the Toronto Star. \"Ice actually changes the shape of the wing. If you don't keep the wings clean you could find yourself in a situation where [...] suddenly the aircraft decides to quit flying.\"\nThe airplane's data recorders suggest that there was a significant accumulation of ice on the aircraft's wings and windshield before it crashed. Shortly before the crash, according to the flight voice recorder, the pilots were talking about the poor weather and ask the traffic controller for permission to descend. The airplane's de-icing system had been turned on before the crew had discussed the ice. Recordings of communications seemed to be normal until soon before impact, and the flight crew did not notify air traffic control of any problems.\nInvestigations have suggested that the aircraft was headed away from its destination airport when it went down."}

Both submarines' hulls are covered with to reduce detection by sonar, so the boats' navigational would not have detected the presence of the other.\nLee Willett of said \"the NATO allies would be very reluctant to share information on nuclear submarines. These are the strategic crown jewels of the nation. The whole purpose of a sea-based nuclear deterrent is to hide somewhere far out of sight. They are the ultimate tools of national survival in the event of war.

Navies often used the same nesting grounds,\" said , an independent and analyst primarily known for his work in assessing and reporting upon and .\nPresident of the Royal Naval Association John McAnally said that the incident was a \"one in a million chance\". \"It would be very unusual on deterrent patrol to use active sonar because that would expose the submarine to detection. They are, of course, designed to be very difficult to detect and one of the priorities for both the captain and the deterrent patrol is to avoid detection by anything,\" he said.\nThe development of , making the submarines less visible to other vessels has properly explained that a submarine does not seem to have been able to pick out another submarine nearly the length of two football pitches and the height of a three-story building. \n\"The modus operandi of most submarines, particularly ballistic-missile submarines, is to operate stealthily and to proceed undetected. This means operating passively, by not transmitting on sonar, and making as little noise as possible. A great deal of technical effort has gone into making submarines quiet by reduction of machinery noise. And much effort has gone into improving the capability of sonars to detect other submarines; detection was clearly made too late or not at all in this case,\" explained Stephen Saunders, the editor of , an annual reference book (also published online, on and microfiche) of information on all the world's arranged by nation, including information on ship's names, dimensions, armaments, silhouettes and photographs, etc.\nAccording to Bob Ayres, a former CIA and US army officer, and former associate fellow at , the Royal Institute of International Affairs, however, the submarines were not undetectable, despite their \"stealth\" technology. \"When such submarines came across similar vessels from other navies, they sought to get as close as possible without being detected, as part of routine training.

They were practising being able to kill the other guy's submarine before he could launch a missile.Because of the sound of their nuclear reactors' water pumps, they were still noisier than old diesel-electric craft, which ran on batteries while submerged.

Regina.\n\"It's a natural meteor, definitely,\" said Bill Cooke, an astronomer at NASA's Meteoroid Environment Office. \nOn Tuesday, February 10, the American civilian communications satellite Iridium 33, launched in 1997, and the defunct Russian military communications satellite Kosmos-2251, launched in 1993, collided over Siberia. On Friday February 13, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) issued an alert for falling debris from the satellites, following reports of \"explosions and earthquakes\" along with \"flashes in the sky\" in Jackson and Louisville, Kentucky.\nThen again on Sunday, calls to 9-1-1 began to come in to Williamson County, Texas sheriff's office around 12:30 p.m. (Central time) that burning debris and fireballs were seen falling from the sky onto parts of Austin, Houston, Waco and San Antonio.\n\"The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) reported to local law enforcement on Friday that these events are being caused by falling satellite debris. These pieces of debris have been causing sonic booms, resulting in vibrations felt by some residents, as well as flashes of light across the sky,\" said the NOAA on Friday in an public information alert posted on their website. The FAA says the burning material over Texas is not related to this alert.\n\"We don't know what it was [over Texas],\" said Roland Herwig, a spokesman for the FAA on Monday. The alerts still remain in effect in Kentucky until further notice.\nResidents in Texas reported their homes and windows shaking and large explosions on Sunday morning. After a search of several areas, the Williamson county sheriff's office reported that no debris or impact sites were found. Earlier unconfirmed reports had said the debris could have been the result of a small plane exploding. \nThere was previous speculation was that the object in Texas could have been a meteor. Doctor Marco Ciocca, a professor at Eastern Kentucky University told WKYT on Sunday that it's too early for the debris from the satellites to be reentering the planet's atmosphere. \"[It could] be months\" before any of the satellite wreckage enters the earth's atmosphere. \"The debris doesn't simply fall out of its orbit. It will either vaporize or stay in orbit for some time before falling into earth's atmosphere.\"\nHowever, the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS) said on February 12 that the debris could have taken 10 days or less to reenter over portions of the planet. \n\"Within 24 hours of the collision, the U.S. space tracking system had identified 600 pieces of debris. This large number suggests that the collision must have been relatively head-on. If the two satellites hit head-on, rather than a glancing blow, the energy of the collision would completely disintegrate both satellites into clouds of debris,\" said the UCS in a statement on their website who also added that the collision took place in \"the same region of space where China destroyed a defunct Chinese weather satellite with an anti-satellite (ASAT) weapon\" in 2007. \"That January 2007 test created a massive amount of debris.\" There have been at least eight major satellite collisions since 1991. \nThe satellites, both of which had a mass in excess of 450 kilograms, and were traveling at approximately 17,500 miles per hour (28,150 km/hour), collided 491 miles (790 km) above the earth. Scientists say the explosion caused by the collision was massive. They are still trying to determine just how large the crash was and how the earth will be affected. STRATCOM continues to track the debris. The results of a plotting analysis will be posted to a public website."}

I don't know of any other photos of this. No bird watchers have ever given convincing reports that they have seen it at all... This is an exciting discovery,\" said Allen. \nThe Luzon Buttonquail was only known through an illustration in the authoritative book by Robert S.

Quails and Buttonquails were more often shot in the fields at this time, rather than caught, and occasionally included the rare Luzon (Worcester\u2019s) Buttonquail, which is only known from dead specimens, and is a threatened bird species reported from Dalton Pass,\" he added.\nIn August, 1929, Richard C. McGregor and Leon L. Gardner of the compiled a book entitled \"Philippine Bird Traps\". The authors described the Luzon Buttonquail as \"very rare,\" having only encountered it twice, once in August and once in September. \n\"They are caught with a scoop net from the back of a .

'Spring ' were also used, where a slip noose fastened to a strongly bent bamboo or other elastic branch, which is released by a trigger, which is usually the perch of the trap,\" their book explained.\nA passage from the bird-trap book, which explains why had eaten these endangered bird species, goes as follows:\nA global review of threatened species by the (IUCN) indicates drastic decline of animal and plant life. This includes a quarter of all , one out of eight birds, one out of three and 70 percent of plants.\nThe report, , is published by IUCN every year. Additionally, a global assessment of the health of the world's species is released once in four years. The data is compiled by 1,700 experts from 130 countries. The key findings of the report were announced at the World Conservation Congress held in Barcelona, Spain. \nThe survey includes 44,838 species of wild and , out of which 16,928 species are threatened with extinction. Among the threatened, 3,246 are tagged critically endangered, the highest category of threat. Another 4,770 species are endangered and 8,912 vulnerable to extinction. \nEnvironmental scientists say they have concrete evidence that the planet is undergoing the \"largest mass extinction in 65 million years\". Leading environmental scientist Professor Norman Myers says the Earth is experiencing its \"Sixth Extinction.\"\nScientists forecast that up to five million species will be lost this century. \"We are well into the opening phase of a mass extinction of species. There are about 10 million species on earth. If we carry on as we are, we could lose half of all those 10 million species,\" Myers said.\nScientists are warning that by the end of this century, the planet could lose up to half its species, and that these extinctions will alter not only biological diversity but also the evolutionary processes itself. They state that human activities have brought our planet to the point of biotic crisis.\nIn 1993, Harvard biologist E.O. Wilson estimated that the planet is losing 30,000 species per year - around three species per hour. Some biologists have begun to feel that the biodiversity crisis dubbed the \"Sixth Extinction\" is even more severe, and more imminent, than Wilson had expected.\nThe Luzon Buttonquail (\"Turnix worcesteri\") is a species of bird in the family. It is to the island of in the Philippines, where it is known from just six localities thereof. Its natural habitat is subtropical or tropical high-altitude grassland, in the highlands of the , although records are from 150-1,250 m, and the possibility that it frequents forested (non-grassland) habitats cannot be discounted.\nThe or \"hemipodes\" are a small family of birds which resemble, but are unrelated to, the true . They inhabit warm grasslands in Asia, Africa, and Australia. They are assumed to be , and breed somewhere in northern Luzon in April-June and that at least some birds disperse southwards in the period July-March. \nThese \"Turnicidae\" are small, drab, running birds, which avoid flying. The female is the more brightly coloured of the sexes, and initiates courtship. Unusually, the buttonquails are , with the females circulating among several males and expelling rival females from her territory. Both sexes cooperate in building a nest in the earth, but only the male the eggs and tends the young.\nCalled \"Pugo\" () by natives, these birds inhabit rice paddies and scrub lands near farm areas because of the abundance of seeds and insects that they feed on regularly. These birds are characterized by their black heads with white spots, a brown or fawn colored body and yellow legs on males and the females are brown with white and black spots. \nThese birds are very secretive, choosing to make small path ways through the rice fields, which unfortunately leads to their deaths as well, they are hunted by children and young men by means of setting spring traps along their usual path ways.\nButtonquails are a notoriously and unobtrusive family of birds, and the species could conceivably occur in reasonable numbers somewhere. They are included in the (as evaluated by IUCN Red List of ). They are also considered as by IUCN and BirdLife International, since these species is judged to have a ten percent chance of going extinct in the next one hundred years."}

Among the dead, according to \"Monsters and Critics\", are two technicians, a major and two second lieutenants. \"ABS-CBN News\" reports that the dead included three high ranking officials and two lower ranking ones.\nJorge Ballesteros, a Colombian air force official, says that the plane took off from an air force base in the city of Puerto Salgar and was on an exercise mission when it crashed. He also states that although it was on a training exercise, the plane was carrying bombs and machine guns.\nA military team has been dispatched to the area to investigate the incident, but they have already put the blame on mechanical failure. Ballestero noted that investigators have ruled out a rebel attack and terrorism as possible causes.\nAC-47's have been used by the Colombian air force for nearly 20 years, most of which were donated from the United States. They were provided to the country in an attempt to fight the illegal drug market and to defend citizens and the military against rebel attacks. They are also used to gather intelligence and come equipped with a state-of-the-art communications system, radar and infrared detection systems."}

In aviation, a stall is when the air no longer flows over the wings of an aeroplane, and the aircraft can no longer keep the lift necessary to keep it airborne, causing it to fall. \nThe normal manoeuvre to recover from a stall for wing icing is to apply full power to the engines and push the nose down. For a tail stall recovery, the opposite procedure is used: the nose should be pulled up and engine power reduced. In this instance, the pilot seems to have pulled the nose upward, but also increased the engine throttles to their full setting.\nAfter the aeroplane pulled up abruptly, it then pitched down at an angle of 31 degrees, rolling left and right, partially upside-down. This sort of stall is known as an aggravated stall, and it can be very difficult to return the aeroplane to normal flight from one. In this case, the pilot had less than two thousand feet to do so before the aircraft crashed into the ground.\nThe pilot's training has now been put into question, and it was discovered that the captain, Marvin Renslow, aged 47, had logged only 110 hours in this particular aircraft, though he had thousands of hours in similar aircraft. Experts say his experience should have adequately prepared him.\nA spokesman for the National Transportation Safety Board, Keith Holloway, said that it is currently too early to definitively say what caused the crash. \"We have not concluded anything,\" he said.\nContinental Connection Flight 3407 crashed into a house in Clarence Center, a suburb of Buffalo on February 12 in icy weather, killing all 49 people on board the aeroplane and one person on the ground."}

Netanyahu has been on the record as saying that he supports settlement expansion and believes that negotiations with Palestine are a waste of time. Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas has said that there will be no negotiation as long as settlement expansion continues. Furthermore the coalition between Likud and Avigdor Lieberman's party would be a huge blow to the Palestinian's mainly because of Lieberman's refusal to negotiate the question of whether or not to divide the city of Jerusalem, a city which Palestinians have hoped to make their capital for a Palestinian state.

None of the injuries were life-threatening, although six of the injured are expected to be hospitalised for up to three weeks.\nThe aircraft landed safely at Tokyo's Narita International Airport, whereupon ambulances took the injured to nearby hospitals.\n\"I was so scared, I thought I would die,\" said an unnamed passenger, describing the incident. \"My whole body was lifted into the air.\"\n\"The person in front of me flew up to the ceiling. The person behind me collapsed and looked unconscious,\" another said.\n\"Air turbulence is believed to be the cause. The turbulence occurred 25 to 30 minutes before landing, when the seat belt light was on,\" said a spokesman for Northwest Airlines, Masashi Takahashi. \"During the flight, we received a message from the pilot saying two or three people were injured. But [the pilot] probably assessed that an emergency landing was not necessary,\" he said to Agence France-Presse.\nNorthwest Airlines has stated that the seat belt sign was turned on during the incident."}

Scientology considers psychiatry to be barbaric and a violation of human rights.\nThe video was posted on the video sharing website YouTube, but was later removed \"due to a copyright claim by Axiom 10 Productions, Inc.\" of XenuTV questioned why Axiom 10 would utilize the Digital Millennium Copyright Act to remove the video from YouTube, as it was promoting their ideology about psychiatrists. It was later re-added to another site called \"\".\nDavid Figueroa, a spokesperson for the (CCHR), a human rights group founded by the Church in 1969, said, \"terrorism employs violence. Against not just the general public, like in 9/11, but against individuals when they are captured.\" Figueroa is president of the CCHR organization in Florida.\n\"To take [a] person, and turn them into a killing machine, against their will or have them do things that are against their nature, you need something behind that. Psychiatrists employ drugs and conditioning techniques in order to change people from what they would normally be, into killing machines,\" added Figueroa. He also says that the leader of al-Qaeda, Osama bin Laden got the idea to form the terrorist group from his second in command, in 1988. Then 13 years later, 19 terrorists hijacked four U.S. commercial airliners, crashing two into the towers, one into the and one into a field in Pennsylvania. The attacks killed nearly 3,000 people.\n\"He was [bin Laden] just transformed from someone who was a supporter\" of the \"\" against the Russian occupation of Afghanistan, into someone whose \"whole thought patterns and his entire viewpoint was changed by Zawahiri, and by whatever types of drugs Zawahiri used to make that change in bin Laden, we don't know\", said Figueroa, who adds that Zawahiri was acting as a \"psychiatrist\". In another show hosed by Byrnes, former CCHR-International president Dennis H. Clarke claims Zawahiri to be a \"psychiatrist, a therapist\"; Zawahiri is referred to in this program as the \"guy who runs\" bin Laden. However, Zawahiri is actually a surgeon; he is not a psychiatrist or a psychologist.\nFigueroa goes on to say that Japanese pilots responsible for bombing Pearl Harbor, Hawaii in December of 1941 were \"on amphetamines which is a psychiatric drug\" when they attacked. However, the Japanese did not employ kamikaze tactics until later in the war. \"Wikinews\" has contacted the CCHR for a statement regarding Figueroa's remarks, but have yet to receive a reply. Scientology-associated publications have also attributed tragedies including the and the Holocaust to psychiatry.\nAt the conclusion of the television program, the host promotes a brochure which he says illustrates how \"notorious terrorist acts like 9/11 were basically created by psychiatrists operating behind the scenes\".\nThe issue of Scientology's stance on psychiatry was brought to the forefront in the media during a 2005 appearance by Tom Cruise on NBC's program ' with . At the time Cruise told Lauer he was critical of psychiatry and the use of antidepressants. In a December 2008 appearance on the \"Today\" show on a promotional tour for his film ', Cruise told Lauer he wanted to apologize and felt he appeared arrogant in his 2005 interview.\nThis is not the first time the Church made false accusations for acts of violence. In October 2008, the Church falsely accused the internet protest group \"Anonymous\" of a 2007 school shooting in Finland. They accused \"Anonymous\" of being involved in the November 2007 shooting at Jokela High School, in which a man named Pekka-Eric Auvinen shot and killed nine people, including himself. The Church accused Auvinen of being part of Anonymous, and further accused the group of plotting the attack. The (NBI) in Finland later told \"Wikinews\" that Anonymous had nothing to do with the crime."}

Independent surveys show that retailers are doing a very good job in this area, with an 80 percent enforcement rate, and retailers will continue to work to increase enforcement rates even further; the court has correctly noted that the state cannot simply dismiss these efforts.\"\nCalifornia was already forced to pay $282,794 to the ESA for attorneys' fees, money that would've helped with the state's current budget difficulties. Andersen has urged California government officials not to appeal the case. \"The estimated $283,000 in taxpayer money spent by the state on this case is so far an 'ill-advised, and ultimately doomed, attempt at state-sponsored nannyism.'

The format is simple: a question is displayed on screen, and callers phone in with their guesses \u2013 paying a premium rate to do so. The programs are often repetitive, the average question simple, the average prize small.\nOnce in a while, though, something unusual does happen.\nOn December 6 2008, Adela Lup\u0219e, presenting the call-in quiz \"Telepremii\" on Na\u021bional TV on Romanian television, had what \"The Daily Telegraph\" described as a \"tantrum on air\". As the final prize became available, Ms Lup\u0219e's show had no callers. Already excited, she began to shout. Throwing the telephone down on the studio floor and stomping on it, she admonished her viewers, \"I want the telephone to ring now. Now. Call me now!\"\nVarious reports in the English-speaking press went on to state that Ms Lup\u0219e had been fired, or fired and re-hired, that the show had been fined heavily, forced to move to a late-evening time slot, or given an adults-only rating.\nAfter presenting the broadcasts of this morning's call-in programs, including the same one she was supposedly fired from in January, Ms Lup\u0219e spoke to Wikinews from her television studio in Budapest, Hungary to give her first full-length English interview and talk about her work and her version of events.\nAdela Lup\u0219e was born in 1988 to a miner's family in the village of Poiana, Bihor in Transylvania, Romania. A member of Romania's first post-Ceau\u0219escu generation, she grasped the power of television at a young age: \"I think television is the most interesting phenomenon that the modern day has given us...for my type of personality, I find it impressive, the power that television has worldwide...We dress like the people that television promotes. We want to look like the celebrities that television launches.\"\nKnowing television was the career for her, Lup\u0219e moved to the city of Oradea to study journalism, and began a job at a local television station as a health reporter. Using that position as a launching board, she found her way onto the national reality program \"Nor\u0103 pentru mama 1\" (\"Daughter-in-law for Mom\") on Kanal D, a show in which mothers of single sons attempted to matchmake for their children. Lup\u0219e unabashedly admits she took part in the show only for exposure: \"Actually my goal from the start was not to win this thing or to find someone. I wanted to get some attention and get people to know my face. I want this attention because I'm aware of the fact that it is not easy to enter this world! And I was doing all this in order to increase my chances to get my dream job in television.\" That dream: to host a nationally-broadcast talk show.\nAfter participating in \"Nor\u0103 pentru mama\", Lup\u0219e was asked to audition for her first call-in program and was quickly hired. She describes a typical day: \"One hour and a half before the show I'm in the make-up room. After I'm done with hair and make-up I go down to the studio for the before the show to talk to the producer. And then is the result that anyone gets to see.\" All of her banter on-air is improvised: \"Definitely there is no script! Everything that you see comes out spontaneosly during the show.\"\nOn any given day, Ms Lup\u0219e is on camera for between one and five hours, presenting a number of different call-in shows on several different networks: not only Na\u021bional TV but also Prima TV and Antena 1, all broadcast from the same studio. Despite the repetition, she doesn't get bored. \"For me it's always exciting. I enjoy it very much! If I'm tired at the end of the show it means I've done a good show. But I'm never tired during the show.\" When I play a clip of one of her energetic show presentations \u2013 not the one she's become best known for \u2013 she elaborates on her exuberance. \"I'm always excited when I'm about to give big prizes! There is no show without winners!\"\nAdela Lup\u0219e's December 6 broadcast was a normal day. She went to the studio, prepared her hair and makeup, spoke to the producer, and went onscreen. The only thing out of the ordinary, she says, was the size of the prize: 1500 leu, about $US 450, or roughly a month's wage for a typical Romanian. She describes the critical moment in nonchalant terms:\n How did you feel, then, when you began shouting? Many people have said you seemed angry...\n You weren't angry at all?\n Even when you put your foot on the telephone.\n All we in most countries have seen is those two minutes. What happened afterward?\nShe says she and her show weren't fired or fined. The first inkling she had, in fact, that there was something unusual about that day's broadcast was when, on January 9 2009, MTV Russia aired the clip of her shouting and stomping on the phone, mixed with some dramatic orchestral rock music. That same clip, uploaded onto video service YouTube, quickly garnered over one million views.\nAdela Lup\u0219e says she's happy with the attention brought her from her outburst: she's been interviewed on talk shows in both Hungary and Romania so \"people were able to see that I'm a normal, fun to be around person.\" She's occasionally recognized in the street, which she enjoys.\nAnd as for the charge most frequently leveled against her, that she's \"crazy\": \"I think it is normal that people have prejudicies, everyone is free to express his opinion in the same way that I'm free to do my job the best that I can! I'm hurt if my family is unhappy with people's comments but I think I gain the wisdom to ignore the negative feedback!\n\"I think also I'm a little bit crazy. So it's all good!\""}

Twenty percent is over 4,200, but Embraer have not revealed exact numbers.\nThe firm has also scaled back predictions for deliveries and revenue. Estimated delivery figures for 2009 now stand at 242 airliners and corporate jets, compared to the previous number of 270, in the second downwards revision of Embraer of their delivery figures for this year within three months. Revenue for 2009 is now predicted to be US$5.5 billion, down thirteen percent from the previous estimate of US$6.3 billion.\nEmbraer is the world's fourth-largest airframer, following Airbus, Boeing and Bombardier. Embraer stock fell 1.9% after the announcement, or 16 centavos, to 8.46 reais in S\u00e3o Paulo. Over the last twelve months Embraer stock has fallen 55%. The manufacturer also produces military aircraft, but statistics for these are not published.\nIn December, the Metalworkers Union of S\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 dos Campos, claimed the firm planned to cut 4,000 jobs, which Embraer at the time denied. Embraer said they would only take \"such a drastic decision if there are risks to the company\u2019s profitability and sustainability.\" The new statement said that production and administration would take the brunt of the cuts, with engineers retained to continue product development.\nThe company described the decision as vital given \"the new reality of demand for commercial and executive aircraft,\" and noted that \"over 90 percent of its revenues are generated abroad. Therefore, the resiliency that the Brazilian domestic market has been demonstrating through the crisis does not significantly alter this adverse scenario.\"\nThe official news agency Ag\u00eancia Brasil reported that Brazilian President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva was upset by the layoffs. He will meet with company directors next week and wants Embraer to explain the decision."}

Comet Lulin, with the official designation of C/2007 N3, was discovered in 2007 and astronomers say that this is the first time it has visited our solar system and may well be the last.\nAs it makes its way around the Sun, an astonishing 800 gallons (3 m3) of water will evaporate from the comet every second. In each 15 minute period, it will shed enough water to fill an Olympic sized swimming pool. It will come within 38 million miles of Earth at its closest pass, making it visible to the naked eye and even clearer with binoculars or a telescope. \nThe best viewing time for people living in the northern hemisphere is after midnight when Lulin will be at its highest point in the sky, or 40 degrees from the morning horizon. Current estimates peg the maximum brightness at 4th or 5th magnitude, which means dark country skies would be required to see it. No one can say for sure, however, because this is Lulin's first visit.\nAstronomers from NASA and the United Kingdom will use the Swift Telescope to study the comet and its composition. Astronomers also say to see it while you can because this could be the first and only time it passes through our solar system. It's estimated that if it returns, it will not be for another 1,000,000 years.\n\"We won't be able to send a space probe to [the comet], but Swift is giving us some of the information we would get from just such a mission,\" said Jenny Carter, at the University of Leicester in England, who is leading the study.\nThe comet was discovered using the Lulin Observatory in Taiwan by astronomers Ye Quanzhi and Lin Chi-Sheng."}

Benyam Mohammed's case stirred controversy for years. He was a legal resident of the United Kingdom who had come to the UK as a refugee from Ethiopia when he was a child. He explained that he had traveled to Afghanistan in an attempt to quit a drug habit he acquired in the UK. \nHe claimed that all the very serious allegations that he reportedly confessed to were extracted while he was being tortured. He had claimed that he wasn't held in military custody when he was first captured, stating instead that the CIA had temporarily transferred him to a brutal prison in Morocco where the interrogation techniques included mutilating his genitals. He later spent time in the CIA's network of secret interrogation centres including \"The Dark Prison\".\nThe Bush administration eventually stopped denying that he had spent considerable time in CIA custody prior to his transfer to Guantanamo. They continued to deny he had been tortured. He faced the allegation that he had plotted with Jos\u00e9 Padilla and Majid Khan to explode a dirty bomb \u2014 a radiological weapon \u2014 in the United States. \nHe was one of the two dozen Guantanamo captives to face charges before a Guantanamo military commission. He was charged twice in late 2005 before a presidentially authorized commission. Two years after the Supreme Court of the United States overturned the original presidentially authorized military commissions he was charged again before a military commission authorized by the Military Commissions Act. \nHis lawyers initiated legal proceedings through the United Kingdom's justice system to compel the UK government to release to them its role in his detention. The Office of Military Commissions dropped the charges against him in October 2008. Benyam Mohammed was reported to have engaged in a hunger strike as a protest during the last months of his detention. His lawyers claimed his weight had dropped to a level where he was just \"skin and bones\", fainted during their meetings with him, and that his health was at serious risk.\nAll of the British citizens held in Guantanamo were repatriated by 2005. Seven long term British residents were not returned to the UK. Initially it was the British position that they had no responsibility for individuals who weren't citizens. When British resident Bisher al-Rawi's story that he had been an MI5 informant started to be confirmed, there was public pressure for his return.\nIn 2006, a frustrated member of the team negotiating Al Rawi's return leaked that the process had become stalled because the Americans were insisting that they would only release Al Rawi if the United Kingdom was prepared to accept all the former British residents and keep them under round the clock surveillance. After his repatriation to the United Kingdom Mohammed spent a few hours being debriefed by British security officials before he was set free. Three former British residents remain in detention in Guantanamo: Shaker Aamer, Ahmed Beltacha and Farhi Saeed bin Mohammed."}

But due to other problems, 12 policemen were ordered to use instead guns for 80-120 kilograms pigs. The pig depopulation in the Pandi farm has reached 1,237 Tuesday amid strong rains as schedules have been set from 5 a.m. to 9 a.m. and from 4 p.m. to 9 p.m. daily, Cecilia Yacob, head of the Bulacan Provincial Public Affairs Office, said.\nMonday's culling was witnessed by representatives from the (FAO), the (WHO), animal welfare observers, Bulacan Gov. Joselito Mendoza and Pandi Mayor Roberto Oca. The slaughter has been estimated to cost 16 million (\u20b1), which include hog farm owners' compensation and the cost of culling for five to seven days. \n\"As of late Tuesday the depopulation teams have culled 2,663 pigs, compared to 442 on Sunday, 795 on Monday and 1,426 on Tuesday; as of early afternoon on Wednesday, the numbers have reached 3,482,\" said Dr. Davinio Catbagan. According to Agriculture Secretary Arthur C. Yap, the culling team has slaughtered 2,078 pigs, bringing the total to 4,741 on Wednesday. The number of hogs had increased to 6,500 from 6,000 as some mother pigs gave birth amid the depopulation.\nBut according to Dr. Joy Gomez, provincial public health officer of Bulacan, six members of the depopulation team at the Pandi \"Win Farm\" have complained of fatigue, headache and dizziness, and have been closely observed by a team of doctors.\nThe state will compensate the farmers, however \"it cannot be [100% of the market price.] A range of about 25%-50%, but it has to be discussed [with the farm owner]. At 25%-50%, the government may pay the farm owner \u20b16.28 million-15.625 million, plus the cost of animal culling operations,\" said Yap. \nA test to check the virus' presence was conducted by the (US-CDC) to verify ongoing transmission. \"Of 160 pig blood samples that were positive for antibodies, 133 came from Bulacan and 27 from Pangasinan as reported by RITM. Those from Bulacan were traced to pigs at different age groups while those in Pangasinan were found in sows and just one piglet. This means that there is on going viral transmission in Bulacan but past infection with recovery was the case in Pangasinan,\u201d Yap explained.\nThe agriculture officials earlier announced that the will be carried out in a \"humane\" manner, following current (OIE) procedures that ensure protection of animal welfare in the Bulacan farm.

He does not recall any direct contact with sick pigs but remembers having flu-like sickness in the past twelve months,\" a DOH statement said, also confirming four pig farm workers and a butcher from Bulacan and Pangasinan tested positive for the antibodies last month.\n\"Ebola Reston poses a low risk to human health at this time,\" said DOH Secretary Dr. Duque. \"147 human samples have been tested for Ebola, but only six have tested positive. But stay away from \"\", and half-cooked pork,\" he added. The laboratory tests of 147 blood samples from workers in the affected areas were conducted by the (RITM) and the US-CDC. RITM has also reported that \"1039 pig blood samples collected by the expert mission yielded negative results on ,\" the DOH said. \nThe 24 other workers tested were all found negative for ERV infection. \"To date, all close contacts of humans with positive anti-bodies who were tested remained anti-body-free signifying absence of illness in affected humans that can lead to possible human-to-human transmission,\" Dr. Duque said. The RITM and the US-CDC also tested 160 pig blood samples: 133 of which came from the Bulacan farm and 27 from the Pangasinan farm; of the 133 blood samples from Bulacan, 19 tested positive for ERV; none of 27 samples from Pangasinan were affected. \nGlobal experts said they will continue to conduct research studies of the Ebola strain to determine how it can be controlled. FAO of the United Nations has initially committed \u20b110 million to buy additional kits. \"We support the Bureau of Animal Industry to expand surveillance in other areas,\" said Kazuyuki Tsurumi, FAO representative in the Philippines. \"We have not committed any amount of money...

We're studying that,\" said Soe Nyunt-U, WHO Representative in the Philippines. \"Our current issue is that the test kits are limited because we are depending on the [United States] CDC [Center for Disease Control and Prevention] to send those kits. If we are going to extend the surveillance both in the animal and human side, we need more test kits,\" he added.\nBoth the DA and DOH officials have decided to expand the scope of the testing for the Reston ebolavirus by inspecting and monitoring hog farms in the whole of , , and province after the culling of the 6,500 pigs.\n\"As a precautionary measure, while there are many questions left unanswered, these ERV-contaminated pigs should be extinguished so we can move forward and study the virus,\" said BAI Director Davinio \"Dave\" Catbagan. \n\"In six months we might be finished testing Regions 3 and 4 depending on the assurance of the US Center for Disease Control and Prevention [in , USA] to give test kits. In Region 3 alone, the government would need to test farms in 566 villages that would require around 36,000 kits, but the country only has 10,000 kits\" Mr. Catbagan said. \"The expanded tests will cover the provinces of Aurora, Bataan, Bulacan, Nueva Ecija, Pampanga, Tarlac and Zambales in Central Luzon, and Cavite, Laguna, Batangas, Rizal and Quezon in Calabarzon,\" Mr. Catbagan added.\nMr. Catbagan has assured infected hog farm owners in Pandi they would be properly indemnified after the country's first large-scale animal depopulation process. \"We are finalizing the indemnification contract. But we will make sure the indemnification would not be open to abuse,\" he said. Fatteners and piglets cost an average of \u20b13,000-4,000 per head, boars cost \u20b125,000-30,000, and sows cost \u20b114,000-15,000.\nJuan Lubroth, senior officer of the Group of FAO\u2019s Animal Health Service, has arrived on Wednesday to discuss in detail with government officials how the agency can support in the wider surveillance. The DA and DOH officials and other government agencies met last Thursday to discuss and finalize the procedure in the burning of 6,500 pigs in Pandi, Bulacan.\n\"The Bureau of Animal Industry and the provincial government of Bulacan, experts carrying out the \u20b1500,000 five-day depopulation would observe three guidelines, namely: the main disposal, water safety, and environment protection. The depopulation process will involve the pigs unconscious, burning them in a 6-foot deep pit, then burying them at the site. We want to make sure that our means would not violate the Animal Welfare Act. We are also ensuring that there would be no seepage,\" Governor Mendoza explained.\n\"Local authorities have decided to use and a \u20b170,000 with a blunt rod to the 6,000 pigs in Pandi, prior to burning using rice hulls before burying them in a pit dug inside the hog farm,\" said Dr. Davinio Catbagan.\n\"About 40 health workers \u2014 clad in special hog mask suits and are tasked to facilitate the depopulation \u2014 would then dump the pigs into 10 30x30-foot pits that can accommodate 600 pigs each. The pits are located some 30 feet from the infected pig farm,\" said Mr Eric Tayag, head of the National Epidemiology Centre. \"The cull could take up to seven days to complete,\" Mr Tayag added. A truckload of disinfectants was prepared amid to be used in the burning.\nThe Pandi culling will be the first large-scale depopulation because of a disease, according to Samuel B. Animas, chief of BAI's animal health division. \"Only one to three pigs are slaughtered at a time in backyard farms during the foot and mouth disease infection [in the 1990s],\" he added.\nMeanwhile, at the 18th hog farmers convention, which was launched on Monday at , the president of the National Federation of Hog Farmers, Albert R. T. Lim, Jr., said hog farmers have feared the effects of Reston ebolavirus virus on industry, since hog exports were banned due to the outbreak. \"We are also apprehensive that if we keep on talking about this thing, some people might just misconstrue or misunderstand what they are talking about and people might get scared,\" Lim said.\nThe government has spent about \u20b110 million to maintain the two hog farms in Bulacan and Pangasinan. \"Anyway, we always have our hog producers in Mindanao to supply Luzon if necessary. I am more concerned about our exports although the Ebola scare also somewhat affected local demand,\" Lim said.\nAmid the nationwide ERV scare and probe, local authorities have seized more than 200 of rotten pork meat at a local market in Wednesday. officials in Maricaban district have intercepted the banned \u2018hot meat\u2019 and arrested Roberto Clet and Rafael Fruelda, who were indicted under the \"Consumer Act of the Philippines.\" The statute punishes the illegal sale of unsafe products like double-dead meat with penalty of \u20b11,000 to \u20b110,000 and not less than six-months but not more than five years of imprisonment.\nLocal police has also arrested four vendors and seized their 3,000 kilos of \"botcha\" (rotten pork meat or \"double dead meat\") at MC Market in , Wednesday evening, and allegedly delivered from Bulacan. The four suspects were charged for violation of the Consumer Act of the Philippines and Republic Act 9296 or the Meat Inspection Code.\nIn December, international experts initially probed outbreak among Philippine pigs, wherein about 6,000 pigs at Pandi and farms were tested for the Reston ebolavirus. \n\"There is no outbreak in , Region 8, said Dr. Archie Lluz, Chief of Regional Animal Disease and Diagnostic Laboratory of the Department of Agriculture in the region. But hog specimens from and , where 270 swine deaths and cases of sick pigs were reported, were examined by lab tests. The results revealed cutaneous , a type of bacterial infection which causes swine deaths due to loss of appetite, dehydration, fever and diarrhea.\nAccording to the DA, sick pigs had been culled from Babatngon, Tacloban City, Alangalang, Santa Fe, Palo, Pastrana, Dagami, Burauen, Tabontabon, Lapaz, Mayorga, and Abuyog in ; Sogod in ; Catbalogan, Calbiga, Daram, and Santa Rita in ; and Lope de Vega in . Swine infections have spread to 18 towns and one city in .\nThe Reston ebolavirus is suspected to be a subtype of the Ebola virus or a new filovirus of Asian origin. It was first discovered in from the Philippines at a laboratory in , Virginia. The same lab then recorded an outbreak of among monkeys imported from the Philippines in 1990. The Reston ebolavirus strain was discovered among monkeys in the Philippines in 1996, and in Italy in 1992.\nAfrican strains of the virus caused deaths of about 50 percent to 90 percent of those infected with prior symptoms of lethal bleeding and organ failure, the WHO said. \"Since the 1970s, scientists, veterinarians, microbiologists and physicians have been looking at thousands of species to see if they can find this elusive reservoir, and we have been pretty much empty-handed,\" Juan Lubroth, head of infectious diseases in the animal health unit of the Food and Agriculture Organization in Rome, explained. \n\"Unlike the three subtypes, Zaire, Sudan and Ivory Coast, which can cause hemorrhagic symptoms, Reston does not. There has been no evidence that Reston can cause significant illness in humans.

Des Moines Independent Community School District\". The \"Tinker\" case was decided on February 24, 1969. The case involved students in Iowa who chose to wear black armbands with peace symbols in protest of the Vietnam War \u2013 in violation of a recent school board policy. In their statement, the ACLU compared issues of freedom of speech in the \"Tinker\" case to a more recent case, \"Gillman v. Holmes County School District\", where a school district in Florida forbade students from wearing rainbow symbols in school in support of LGBT rights.\nIn the \"Tinker\" case, John and Mary Beth Tinker and another student decided to wear black armbands with peace symbols to school in protest of the Vietnam War. The school district heard of the students' plans and decided to ban armbands in school. The three students case were represented by the ACLU of Iowa, and in a 7-2 decision the Supreme Court ruled for the plaintiffs. \nSupreme Court Justice Abe Fortas wrote in the : \"It can hardly be argued that either students or teachers shed their constitutional rights...at the schoolhouse gate.\"\nThe \"Gillman\" case began in September 2007 when according to students at Ponce de Leon High School in Florida, school officials responded improperly to complaints from a lesbian student that she was being harassed by other students. The ACLU contacted the school district on behalf of junior Heather Gillman, inquiring what form of symbols or slogans relating to LGBT rights would be allowed. \nThe school district responded saying it would not allow any expression of the sort, because it would \"likely be disruptive\", and said the wearing of these types of symbols by students could signify they were part of a \"secret/illegal organization\". \nThe video released by the ACLU includes clips of a deposition given by David Davis, the principal of Ponce de Leon High School in Florida. Davis testified he decided to ban students from wearing rainbow symbols in school because the rainbow is a symbol of \"gay pride\", and he said it \"could hinder the educational process\". He also testified that these symbols would immediately cause students viewing them to think of homosexual sex. Heather Gillman commented in the ACLU video \"It was kind of scary, kinda, because I didn't know what people would think, but then I figured 'Who cares what people think, I'm standing up for something I believe in.'\"\nOn May 13, 2008, a federal judge decided in favor of the plaintiff, and permanently enjoined the school district from infringing upon the First Amendment rights of the students. Matt Coles, director of the ACLU's national LGBT Project, stated \"Schools need to know censorship is illegal, and students need to know their schools can't get away with it.\"\nIn reflecting on the use of the \"Tinker\" precedent in the \"Gillman\" case, the ACLU cited three instances in which schools \"were made to stop illegally censoring students thanks to \"Tinker v. Des Moines\".\" These include a 2006 incident where a student in Ohio was instructed by school administrators to remove a t-shirt which read \"I support gay marriage\", and a 2007 incident where a teacher and an assistant principal at a school in Virginia told a student she could not wear a t-shirt with overlapping female gender symbols. In both cases the ACLU represented the students and school officials backed down and apologized for their actions.\nIn a blog post Tuesday by Mary Beth Tinker at Daily Kos, Tinker reflected on the similarities between her case before the Supreme Court of the United States and the more recent federal case of Heather Gillman. \"I\u2019m grateful that the precedent established by the Supreme Court 40 years ago is still protecting students, including LGBT students and their friends,\" wrote Tinker. She encouraged young people to speak out about issues of concern to them and to freely express their thoughts and views. Tinker is currently a nurse in Washington, D.C., and travels the United States speaking to students about their First Amendment rights. "}

This war has so far cost more than 4250 U.S. lives in combat operations in the last six years. The Iraqi deaths are unknown but are estimated to be in the tens of thousands.\nObama added that this withdrawal will allow the U.S. to focus on Al-Qaeda in Afghanistan and Pakistan in the fight against terrorism. Obama also said he is planning to remove all U.S. troops by 2011, in order to complete the transition of Iraq to the Iraqi people. Obama Administration officials said that there was not a more specific schedule set by the president because he wanted to allow the commanders in Iraq more flexibility during the exit strategy."}

The Socialist Alliance (SA) is one of these parties.\nSA is a left-wing political party. There stated describes itself as an anti-capitalist party which believes in \"a democratic society that is run by and for working people, not the tiny, greedy, destructive elite that now rules.\" \nIt should be noted that SA is not registered for Queensland elections due to what they describe as \"restrictive rules for registration.\" Their candidates will run as independents. They are, however, registered for federal elections and elections in other states.\nQueensland's unicameral parliament is up for election on March 21. The election campaign will run for a total of 26 days following the issue of the writs by Governor Penelope Wensley.\n\"Wikinews\" held an exclusive interview with the SA. Answering on behalf of the party was Queensland State Gonvenor Paul Benedek.\nInterview.\nWhy do you want to get into parliament?\nPaul Benedek: For Socialist Alliance, parliament is only one aspect of social change. Our primary focus is building up community action and people's power, because we believe that such grassroots action is essential to social change, as history has shown from struggles for the vote for women to civil liberties to the campaign against the \"[sic]\" Vietnam War.\nHowever, having a socialist in parliament would be a huge asset for such struggles. Having someone who speaks uncompromisingly for the oppressed and voiceless - working people, the unemployed, students, Indigenous people - in the \"parliamentary pit\" would help expose the lack of democracy in a parliamentary system that favours those with wealth and resources. It would boost the resources and media profile for socialist solutions.\nWhat are the three main policies you will take into this election?\nPaul Benedek: \"1. Free public transport &amp; mass investment in renewables to address the climate emergency.\" Unbelievably, the current government is looking to triple coal production in the biggest coal exporting state, in the biggest coal exporting country in the world! Meanwhile, the only solution we have to atrocious traffic and car dependence is...more roads, more tunnels, more bridges!\nSocialist Alliance says we need free public transport to get cars off the road, and provide quality alternatives to all people, regardless of wealth. In the Belgian city of Hasselt, free public transport saw an 800% increase in usage in one year! Socialist Alliance says move on renewable energy rather than more coal mines, and provide retraining for fossil fuel workers in green jobs.\n\"2. Bailout people and communities, not corporations.\" With the worst economic crisis since the 1930s Great Depression, working people are being hit hard - and its going to get worse. The major parties are united in wanting to bail out business - but it's their 'profits before all else' focus that has caused this disaster. Socialist Alliance says we need to defend communities not profits, supporting workers, investing in public housing, health and education. With Sam Watson running in South Brisbane, we will also have an emphasis on justice for Aboriginal people.\n\"3. Make government genuinely accountable to the people.\" We are seeing a LNP \"opposition\" with big business's hands all over it, and the Labor Government which charges thousands of dollars to sit down with Ministers for lunch. Socialist Alliance call for an end to this undemocratic farce. We need community referenda, not fake \u201cconsultation\u201d. An end to cronyism and private factional deals and manipulation. Fixed of government to prevent manipulation for self-interested gain.\nHow will you address these policies?\nPaul Benedek: These are policies that Socialist Alliance fights for on a daily basis, and helps to build movements for. We publish the progressive newspaper Green Left Weekly (www.greenleft.org.au) which provides an excellent alternative to the corporate media. On the environment front, we are involved in the climate justice movement in Brisbane and around the country.\nWho will lead your party if you gain more than one or two seats in parliament?\nPaul Benedek: Socialist Alliance is a truly democratic organisation, with a collective leadership. A key spokesperson for our party would be Aboriginal activist Sam Watson (our candidate for South Brisbane).\nIf you can't form government, who would you like to see do so?\nPaul Benedek: We want to see the most progressive government possible. We would like to see as many Greens elected as possible. We see both Labor and the LNP as big business parties that are almost like choosing between Coke and Pepsi! However, we generally favour Labor over the LNP, as being a slightly lesser evil.\nWhat should Queenslanders keep in mind, when heading to the polls?\nPaul Benedek: That choosing between \"tweedledee\" and \"tweedledum\" once every few years is not real democracy, and with the planet in peril, facing an economic meltdown, and all manner of social problems, we can't afford to leave sociaety \"[sic]\" in the hands of the pro-corporate parties. No matter what the vote is, the struggle will continue in the communities, and while voting can be part of changing the world, its people's power that has always made the most important, progressive changes."}

Already a winner of the smaller imitation contest \"Soundmix Show\", she decided to shoot higher. With a great deal of determination, she performed in front of hundreds of millions of television viewers at the 1998 Eurovision Song Contest in Birmingham, United Kingdom. Her song, the R&amp;B flavored \"Hemel en aarde\" (\"Heaven and earth\"), placed fourth and gave her country their highest placing at Eurovision since their last win in 1975. No Dutch contestant after her has been able to place similarly.\nAfter the accolades died down, Rombley set her sights on promoting her vision and passion through her music. Partnering with producer Tjeerd Oosterhuis became a double blessing; eventually they became husband and wife. Even a return to Eurovision at the 2007 Contest, with less than favorable results, didn't keep her discouraged for long. Today she has finished recording a live CD of her favorite English songs, and a live DVD of selections in Dutch, and is currently touring in singing engagements this spring in theaters across the Netherlands.\nEdsilia Rombley granted \"Wikinews\"' an interview; she reflected on her career, her inspirations, what a day is like in her life, and what she would love to do in the future. This is the third in a series of interviews with past Eurovision contestants, which will be published sporadically in the lead-up to mid-May's next contest in Moscow.\nA day in the life.\n You recently had a birthday. Happy birthday! How did you celebrate this year?\nEdsilia Rombley: I'm doing a tour across 43 Dutch theatres from January until May. On February 13th, I was doing in a show in Beverwijk. I wasn't planning on much, but I was surprised with a birthday cake before the show and lovely presents and flowers, even from the audience! The whole audience sang a birthday song for me during the show, which was great. I had a wonderful evening.\n I've visited your website and you seem to be very busy with various projects. Can you describe what a typical work day is like for you?\nER: Because I often work late and seldom sleep before 1 a.m., I usually get up around 11 a.m., check my e-mail, contact my management for day to day business, and depending on the day I might have photoshoots or interviews. I work out at the gym, get groceries and cook some dinner (yes, I really love cooking!). When I've finished eating, it's usually time for me to get ready for my real \"workday\", although it's more a \"worknight\" for me. My tour manager picks me up and off I go, performing in every corner of the country with my two backing vocals, and I don't usually arrive back home before 1 a.m.\nBeginnings.\n You were originally part of the girl group Dignity. Did you ever feel apprehensive about placing yourself in the public stage at such a young age?\nER: The girls and I all knew each other and one time, after a birthday party we decided to form a group. It was performing with that group (remember, I was only fifteen at the time) that I found my love for performing on a stage and really started thinking about a career in music.\n Your first international recognition came with winning the European Soundmix Show in Amsterdam in 1997. What was the experience like? What memory sticks out most in your mind even today?\nER: That I never thought I would get that far. I remember everyone being nervous and I wasn't really, because I just didn't think it would be such a huge success for me. I was just having fun backstage with everyone, enjoying the experience in general. Only when I won, the reality of having a real long-lasting career in music began to sink in, and that was a great feeling.\n Who were your musical influences in the formative years of your career, and are they still influential to you today? You've covered many songs by Oleta Adams; is she someone you've looked up to in your career?\nER: I listened a lot to artists like Anita Baker, Betty Wright, Gladys Knight and of course Oleta Adams. In our home we listened to soul and R&amp;B music a lot and we grew up singing their songs while doing our daily household chores, singing together using everything we could find as a microphone, from hairbrushes to broomsticks! I respect all these artists for what they accomplished in their career. They brought me in contact with the kind of music I'm still such a big fan of today.\nEurovision '98.\n You won the Nationaal Songfestival by a wide margin in 1998, and then your song \"Hemel en aarde\" placed fourth in Birmingham, which was the highest placing the Netherlands had seen since they won 23 years earlier. Did you find the attention and accolades overwhelming? Going into the Eurovision, did you have any insecurities about your song or your performance? Knowing the Netherlands' shaky track record in the Contest, did you expect to receive high marks?\nER: I really didn't \"expect\" anything at the time. I was very young and was just very proud that I was given the opportunity to represent the Netherlands in this contest. The attention was a very new experience and I felt fortunate every step along the way that I was experiencing all these amazing things. I kept reminding myself to keep both feet firmly on the ground, because as easy as the success may have come at the time, I realised that it could end as quickly as it began.\n You and Ruth Jacott before you are frequently remarked upon as \"revitalizing\" the \"songfestival\" with R&amp;B melodies. Do you think that the urban contemporary sound is what Dutch music needed at that time? Would you consider such a move an \"Americanization\" of Dutch pop music, and if so, do you think that's a good or bad thing?\nER: To be honest I didn't really place the whole experience in such a wide perspective at the time. I just did my thing and it turned out great for me, as I still have a great musical career. I think Dutch pop music has always been influenced by America, this was set in long before I entered the Songfestival; on one hand I think this is a great thing, because America has so many great artists. It's just important that we, while embracing foreign influences, don't forget all the talents in the Netherlands, who make great Dutch music.\nMainstream record success.\n Your next albums after Eurovision were produced by Tjeerd Oosterhuis, who is now your husband. How did you end up in a partnership with him? And perhaps most importantly, how did you two fall in love?\nER: I collaborated with his sister Trijntje Oosterhuis, who introduced me to her brother. So we got to know each other, friends at first, but in the end it wasn't only the musical collaboration that worked out great, we fell in love, and we've been together ever since. It's wonderful that I can share my passion for music with my partner.\n You've done a fair bit of charity work, dedicating songs and concerts both to situations in Bangladesh and for the victims of the Indian Ocean tsunami. What kind of role do you think charity and giving plays in your life? How do you feel about artists who are more concerned with their own images and song rights than coming together to help others?\nER: I always try to do good where I can, as long as the charity is something that touches me and my heart goes out to it. I cannot judge other artists on what they do, especially because I can also understand that you would want to keep those two things (your career as an artist and doing something for charity) separate.\n\"' Whose idea was it to participate in \"Dancing with the Stars\"? Your experience was short overall, but did you have a fun experience? What did you take away from your time on the show?\nER: It was my idea. I used to watch dance contests on TV and loved the amazing dresses of the female dancers. This was my chance to wear some of those great dresses myself! I had a great experience. The most important thing I learned [was that] professional dancing is much more difficult [than] I thought it would be!\n You've released albums in a variety of different genres, in both English and Dutch. What genre do you feel best describes your innermost feelings? Do you prefer singing in Dutch over English? Have you considered starting a music career in the United States? You could give Jennifer Hudson a run for her money...\nER: English and Dutch both feel good to me, it's very difficult to choose a favourite language. I love to see people party to my up-tempo Dutch repertoire, but can also put all my emotion into a Dutch ballad. With English it's especially the soul repertoire that touches me, and if I get the chance to take my musical career abroad, I would jump at the opportunity! I am very happy with what I've accomplished so far, but am of course always striving for more.\n Recently you released a CD and DVD, where you performed your past hits. How did the idea for a live album come about? Listening to some of the tracks, the sound is very intimate and personal; was this something that was a selling point for you? How did you feel revisiting your entire repertoire?\nER: The DVD is called \"Live @ The Wisseloord Studios\" and contains these studio sessions, which are all Dutch songs from my album \"Meer dan ooit\". As a bonus there are English songs from my 2005 tour, and songs from Anita Baker, Betty Wright, Gladys Knight and Oleta Adams.\nThe album is simply called \"Edsilia Rombley LIVE\" and contains a selection of my favourite English songs from the same tour, and I am so proud that these songs are finally on CD, because before I could not let people hear the English repertoire (unless I sang live to them).\nEurovision '07 and thoughts about the Contest today.\n In 2007, you returned to the Eurovision, and as someone fondly remembered from a past contest, there were high hopes placed on you. However, your song \"On Top of the World\" did not advance from the semi-finals. How disappointed were you that you didn't advance? Did you feel \"On Top of the World\" was as strong of a song as \"Hemel en aarde\" was?\nER: Of course I went in with a positive, winning attitude, so needless to say I was disappointed. For me everything felt perfect, the song, the team I was surrounded by, it all came together perfectly. The reactions in the Netherlands were very positive, so I had that to take with me from the experience. It's the way things go sometimes, I don't dwell on it too much. \nI can't really compare the two songs, there was so much time between them, the music industry has changed, as well as the Eurovision. What was different is that at the time of \"Hemel en aarde\" every country sang in their own language, which was one of the unique things [about] Eurovision.\n In the past decade, public interest in Eurovision has dwindled a great deal in the Netherlands, leading a trend that has followed in countries like France and Germany (all three share a common trait in that they haven't won the Contest in decades). Do you feel that's a big reason interest has tapered off, or are there other problems you see that have Dutch people tuning out? Is there anything NOS can do to get Dutch people watching the Contest again, especially in a television landscape populated by reality fare?\nER: As I pointed out before, every country sang in their own language before, which was one of the things that separated the Eurovision from other talent shows. With an overflow of talent shows nowadays, the diversity is gone, and you feel the pressure to sing in English more and more. Furthermore, if a professional jury had the upper hand in selecting winners, I believe that would make a big difference as well.\n Many fans on esctoday.com have expressed a negative opinion of this year's entrant, De Toppers, saying that their music is out of touch with today's styles. What are your feelings about De Toppers, and do you think they have a good chance of advancing from the semi-finals?\nER: De Toppers are very successful in the Netherlands, so from that point of view they have a chance. Whether or not their national success will help them advance at Eurovision, only time can tell.\n Do you ever see yourself returning to the Eurovision stage as the representative from the Netherlands?\nER: No. As I said, the experiences were great, and the first time I entered was the start of a future in music for me, for that I am very grateful. I have learned never to say never again though, but from where I stand right now, I would not participate again.\n Will you be a part of the Dutch delegation going to Moscow this year? \nER: No, I will not be part of the delegation.\n In closing, what would you like to say to all of your fans in the Netherlands and across Europe?\nER: I am so grateful that so many people are still supporting what I do, giving me the opportunity to do what I love to do most. It makes it so much more fun to be on stage when you see people enjoying your performance. My 2009 tour is titled: Just let me sing... (\"Laat mij maar zingen\"...) So as long as you keep enjoying my music, I will definitely not stop singing!\nSource.\n __NOEDITSECTION__"}

The study was performed in the Nouabale-Ndoki National Park in the Congo in an area known as the Goualougo Triangle. The study was published in the Royal Society journal \"Biology Letters\".\nDr. Crickette Sanz, the leader of the team who filmed the chimps crafting \"fishing rod\" type tools, says that they have \"invented\" ways of \"improving their termite-fishing technique\" by using a stick from a plant called the Marantaceae. They pick off the leaves and then create and place a brush like object on the end. Doing so improved the number of termites they catch, by more than 10 times.\n\"They then pulled the herb stems through their teeth, which were partially closed, to make the brush and they also attended to the brush by sometimes pulling apart the fibres to make them better at gathering the termites,\" stated Sanz to the BBC.\nResearchers are aware that chimps have used similar methods in the past, but it was not fully known if the tools they used were designed specifically for the task of gathering the insects. Of all the tools the chimps left behind and recovered by Sanz's team, 80% were custom made by their owners. Sanz says the new study has determined that their methods have since evolved, proving previous hypotheses.\n\"Our results indicate that chimpanzees have a mental template of the tool form, which is employed in crafting the tool prior to use and refining it during use,\" Sanz said. \nSanz also says that because of Africa's vastness, much of it is still unstudied leaving him to suggest other species of chimps and apes use complex tools to gather food.\n\"Just as we are learning about these exciting new complex tool behaviours, the chimps that are showing us these behaviours are under danger from logging, poaching and Ebola,\" added Sanz. The triangle is a host to a variety of endangered or threatened animals including gorillas and elephants. "}

Gen. Randolph Alles of the 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing. Four Marine squadron officers have been relieved of duty, as well as Navy officers. Eight enlisted Marines and one Navy sailor have been reprimanded. The pilot has been grounded.\nOn the day of the accident the pilot, Lt. Dan Neubauer, had just taken off from the aircraft carrier USS \"Abraham Lincoln\" when he reported that the aircraft's right engine had low oil pressure.\nNeubauer, who was still in training, shut the engine down as a precaution, leaving the plane operating on the left engine. The \"Abraham Lincoln\"'s captain and the 'air boss' suggested an emergency landing at the North Island military base, which was about 100 miles from the carrier. This would have given an approach from over the ocean.\nNeubauer contacted his squadron bosses and instead opted to try to land at Marine Corps Air Station Miramar, which was 11 more miles away and involved a flight path over San Diego. Neubauer also failed to read his own emergency checklists, instead having sections read to him by his squadron representatives on the ground. The squadron representatives at Miramar were unaware of all the details of the situation on board and did not read out all the relevant sections.\nOfficers at Miramar were informed of the fact that a warning light indicated the remaining engine was running low on fuel. However, they did not take heed in what was described by the report as a \"critical mistake\". In fact, the plane's tanks had plenty of fuel, but the engine trouble was caused by the faulty fuel flow system, which fed the left engine. Officers also failed to watch the plane's location properly. \nUpon final approach to Miramar, Neubauer thought, incorrectly, that he could not turn right, towards his inoperative engine. Instead, he conducted a long leftwards loop to line up. The maneuver took around ninety seconds to complete and starved the left engine of fuel, causing it to flameout. At this point the jet fell towards the ground and the pilot attempted to aim the aircraft for a canyon, where it could crash safely. However, the plane did not stay airborne and struck a house at an estimated 150 mph. It is thought that two more seconds would have been enough for the plane to reach the canyon.\nInstead, the crash killed four people inside the house; a grandmother, her daughter and her two granddaughters. The children's father, Dong Yun Yoon, was among those briefed on the publication of the report, alongside politicians in Washington and San Diego. The pilot safely ejected after holding on as long as possible, the report stating that a second or two more would have likely resulted in his death.\nThe investigation has a number of implications. The fuel problem was not followed up on as it was not on a list of faults requiring immediate repair, but nonetheless 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing operations officer Col. John Rupp said keeping it in the air \"was collectively poor judgment on the part of the squadron's maintenance department.\" The commanding officer, operations officer, aviation maintenance officer and operations duty officer have all been relieved of duty, while eight other marines and a sailor were reprimanded.\nMaintenance standards have been upgraded and emergency training enhanced as a result. Flight simulators are set to include a scenario based on the accident. Lt. Dan Neubauer has been grounded and it is up to the deputy commandant for aviation whether he will be allowed to return to the air. Immediately after the accident, all F/A-18s were grounded and inspected. The Marines issued a bulletin to all other operators of the aircraft worldwide to warn them of the circumstances.\nSo far, the Marines and the United States Navy have identified 40 F/A-18 Hornets with the same problem. None of these have crashed."}

Leading a fight to remove a cap on the number of competing countries brought them back to the Contest in 1991 after a 16-year absence, and ever since the nation has had perfect attendance. \nSince then, Malta's dependable \"shining star\" has been Chiara Siracusa, who goes by her first name in her music career. First competing in 1998 at the age of 21, she was pushed to the brink of victory until the votes from the final country that evening leveled her placement to third. Her rendition of the song \"The One That I Love,\" and the recognition she received not only for herself, but for her country, made her a star in Malta overnight, and helped her launch a singing career in Europe.\nShe would later return to the Contest in 2005 with \"Angel,\" an anthem she penned herself, and achieved second place. Now, in 2009, she will be going back to Eurovision for a third try, hoping for the \"3-2-1\" charm and a victory \u2014 something that has eluded her thus far. Her entry, the ballad \"What If We,\" has special memories for Chiara; it is dedicated to her father, who is recently deceased. \nWhat if Chiara could take home the gold in Moscow; for Malta, for her father, and for herself? Only time will tell. Chiara took time out of her Eurovision promotional schedule to answer some questions from \"Wikinews\"' about her past performances, and most importantly, her upcoming one.\nThis is the fourth in a series of interviews with past Eurovision contestants, which will be published sporadically in the lead-up to mid-May's next contest in Moscow.\n You'll be going to Moscow for a third try at possibly winning Eurovision. Why did you decide to compete this year? How did your partnership with Marc Paelinck and Gregory Bilsen come about?\nChiara: Well, I met Marc Paelinck long time ago through a friend in Belgium. We started working together and it brought us to this collaboration today. I was thinking of going back to the festival [for a long time] and this year felt like the right year to do so.\n Eurovision fans from across Europe picked you as the wide favorite to win Malta's preselection this year. Were you as confident? Were you nervous about competing in the semi-final rounds this time around, or did you think this was something you could handle?\nChiara: When I go into a competition, I always go to win, but I was nervous like everyone else...I think [when] you win a festival, [you win] for what you present, not for what your history is.\n Growing up, did you always want to become a singer? Who were your musical influences, and what genres do you think are your favorite? Do you think these preferences have molded you into the singer you are today?\nChiara: Definitely. My mum always says I used to sing and dance for them all the time since I was a baby, and I've always loved ballads. In fact, my favourite singer has always been Whitney Houston.\n How did you come to the decision to enter the Eurovision pre-selection for Malta back in 1998? What kinds of feelings did you experience during the path you took to eventual victory in the national final?\nChiara: 1998 was my first time in the festival. I was very young and I felt I could never win it. I wanted just to try and be there with the big names of those times. It was very scary and overwhelming, [and] then I won.\n Did you feel overwhelmed performing in front of an international audience in Birmingham? What kind of personal feelings and emotions made you relate to the song you sang, \"The One That I Love\"? There were remarks afterwards that your performance was great, but your dress had similarities to Barbara Dex's from five years before (and she has become well-known for her \"fashion don't\"). Looking back on it, what did you think of that dress?\nChiara: Well...looking back I remember that I was completely overwhelmed [singing] in front of so many people. I was very scared but managed to do well. As for the dress, they were different times [back then] and it was beyond my control.\n You came very close to winning the Contest for Malta back in 1998. When you didn't, how did it make you feel? Did you feel \"robbed\"? As an addenda, some Wikipedians I've talked to have hypothesized that tabloid hype before the event helped Dana International win; in other words, she would not have won had she not been a transsexual. Do you feel that's true, and did you like her song?\nChiara: I know a lot of Maltese who voted for Dana because they liked the song and for no other reason. The song was good and we still hear it today. \nObviously when you are so close to winning something and you don't, yes, you feel a bit robbed, but [then there's] the moment [when] you realise you did well and you are happy.\n After Eurovision, you made a transformation from an unknown singing hopeful to a true recording artist. Tell us a bit about your transformation, and how you felt during this time. Also, around this time you started to perform in concerts and festivals abroad. What was your best memory from this time, when you were performing abroad and people from outside Malta not only knew who you were, but were interested in your life and music.\nChiara: Everything came like rain in my life, from one thing to the other, and before I knew it I became \"Chiara of Malta.\" I loved it, but I didn't have much time to think about it. It came quickly; I went to a lot of places and sang with many people but I think what I will always remember is the concert I did with my band, where Seal was as well in the same event, in Frankfurt. It was incredible.\n In 2005, you entered the Contest again, this time with a song you wrote yourself. What is the meaning behind \"Angel,\" and what kind of story do the lyrics tell about your own life and experiences?\nChiara: \"Angel\" is a love song and it will always have a special place in my heart. It's about the love you give someone without wanting anything back, and the unlimited support too.\n You achieved the best placing for Malta in Eurovision history with your performance in 2005. What did you learn from your experiences in 1998 and, in your mind, how did you improve to become more successful in 2005?\nChiara: I think it's the maturity and the experience. [Through] the years, without knowing, you [gather] so many lessons and behave better and take things a bit more serious and so on.\n Surely you've read not only supportive comments, but negative ones as well, particularly concerning your weight. At the same time, however, you have become a role model of sorts for fuller-figured women across Europe, who aren't accustomed to seeing \"people like them\" at Eurovision. How did you deal with the negativity, both in the context of the Contest and in your personal life, and what message do you hope to give to full-figured women who look to you for inspiration?\nChiara: Well, I have always been \"full figured,\" as you put it. I have spent time in my life trying to become as thin as I could, but I could never make it. Through the years I have learnt to accept myself and love me for what I am and how I look. I feel I have nothing less than others and my advice is to be happy with yourself, and love yourself, because you can never get someone to love you if you yourself don't.\n Tell us about the emotions you convey in the song \"What If We.\" Every song has a story, so what is the story played out in this song?\nChiara: The story for me with this song is completely about my father. He was the one to contact Marc [Paelinck] and he was the machine behind Eurovision for me, so he's entirely what this song is about for me and being that he passed away three months ago, well, it makes the song very special when \nI sing it.\n If you had to absolutely pick one song, which of the three songs you've submitted is your favorite, and why?\nChiara: The three songs [each] have a story of [their own]. \"The One That I Love\" gave me my whole career, my fame and everything I am today so i can never forget it; \"Angel\" is too special because it's like my baby, I wrote it myself; and \"What If We\" is very deep in my heart because of my dad, so I can never choose between them. Sorry!\n What are your plans for after the Contest? What kinds of projects would you like to pursue? Have you considered launching a singing career in the United States?\nChiara: My immediate project after the festival is an album which I have already started working on, in my style [which] is completely ballads, then wherever that takes me I'll go, [whether it be] the U.S. or elsewhere.\n Finally, what would you like to tell all of your fans, awaiting your performance this May in Moscow?\nChiara: I would like to thank them for the ongoing support they have always showed me, and promise them I will give them my all on the performance night in Moscow.\nSource.\n __NOEDITSECTION__"}

Turkish Airlines Flight 1951 crashed upon approach to Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport, killing nine and injuring eighty of the 135 passengers and crew on board.\nPieter van Vollenhoven, head of the Dutch Safety Board, said yesterday that as the aircraft was at 1,950 feet the faulty altimeter indicated that the airliner's height was at minus eight feet. Because the autopilot and autothrottle were running from this flawed data the plane automatically reduced engine power as it would in the final seconds before landing.\nThe plane's altitude and airspeed continued to fall for a minute and a half without the pilots noticing, when at 450 feet and an airspeed 46 mph lower than it should be the aircraft's stick shaker activated to warn the flight crew of an imminent aerodynamic stall. The pilots applied full engine thrust, but were too late to prevent the accident, and the aircraft crashed into a field and broke into three pieces.\n\"When the crew of the Turkish Airlines noticed what was going on, it was already too late to intervene effectively,\" commented the Board's press release. The Board also sent a warning to Boeing concerning possible problems with the 737-800's altimeters. The United States airframe manufacturer has issued an alert to operators of all variants of the 737 worldwide - totalling almost 6,000 aircraft - reminding flight crews \"to carefully monitor primary flight instruments during critical phases of flight.\"\nBoeing have also stated that the preliminary report \"should not be construed as a final conclusion or outcome of the investigation,\" and that the Board is still \"in the early stages of this complex investigation.\" Further, they told \"ABC News\" that \"erroneous radio altimeter readings are detectable and recoverable. Should a radio altimeter failure occur, anomalous readings would be detected by monitoring systems or be apparent through flight deck effects.\"\nIt is apparent from the flight data recorder - which carries details of the plane's last eight flights - that the altimeter had also failed on at least two previous occasions, but the aircraft was able to land safely. Van Vollenhoven commented that misty conditions at the time of the crash would have prevented the pilots seeing their height earlier, and also said that the plane's automatic flight systems should not be used when crucial instruments are defective."}

NASA cited the need for additional time to evaluate the shuttle's hydrogen fuel flow control valves.\nLiftoff is set for nighttime on Wednesday, March 11, at approximately 9:20 p.m. (EST) from Launch Complex 39A in Cape Canaveral, Florida. The official countdown to launch will commence Sunday, March 8.\n\"The team came through, worked hard and was efficient. It's time now to step back and think of everything else we need to watch before launch on the 11th. There's no better team than this one and I thank them for putting the right analysis together,\" said Bill Gerstenmaier, associate administrator for Space Operations at NASA.\nNASA wanted to perform additional tests on the valves which control the amount of hydrogen fuel pumped into the external tank when the shuttle is taking off before making a decision to launch. When Space Shuttle Endeavour went into space in November 2008, one of the valves broke. NASA fears that if one breaks off on this mission, then it could damage the outside of the shuttle.\nThe current scheduled mission, STS-119, is set to fly the Integrated Truss Structure segment (\"S\" for starboard, the right side of the station, and \"6\" for its place at the very end of the starboard truss) and install the final set of power-generating solar arrays to the International Space Station. The arrays consist of two 115-foot-long arrays, for a total wing span of 240 feet, including the equipment that connects the two halves and allows them to twist as they track the sun.

When planets pass in front of their parent star, a small black dot is cast over the star, called a transit. Transits by terrestrial planets produce a small change in a star's brightness of about one part in ten thousand (.01%), lasting for 2 to 16 hours.\nKepler's view is 105 square degrees and will be focused on one area all the time. It will orbit around our Sun, maintaining a constant distance from Earth of 950 miles. It will continuously and simultaneously monitor the brightnesses of more than 100,000 stars for the life of the mission, which is expected to be three and a half years.\n\"Even if we find no planets like Earth, that by itself would be profound. It would indicate that we are probably alone in the galaxy,\" said William Borucki, the mission's science principal investigator.\nAlthough planets orbiting stars other than the Sun had been theorized for centuries, it was only in 1988 that a team of Canadian astronomers made the first detection of extrasolar planets orbiting the star Gamma Cephei. Now over 300 extrasolar planets are said to have been discovered.\nThe launch comes just weeks after NASA's failed launch of the Orbiting Carbon Observatory, which crashed into the ocean off Antarctica's coast. It would have been the first spacecraft dedicated to studying atmospheric carbon dioxide, the most significant human-produced greenhouse gas and the principal human-produced driver of climate change.

Wolfram Alpha is described by CEO Stephen Wolfram as a \"computational knowledge engine.\" Unlike Google, Yahoo! and other traditional web search engines that rely on statistical methods for retrieving online documents, Wolfram Alpha answers factual questions in the way that Wikipedia does, except it relies on analytical methods instead of human-generated documents.\nAlthough the product is still in a limited release some details about its operation and design have been revealed by Wolfram on his blog, and by Nova Spivack who recently interviewed Wolfram about Wolfram Alpha. The product is available on the Web as a single search box reminiscent of Google\u2019s main search page. The search queries can be entered in natural language and the natural language system will parse the query and use models of knowledge (ontologies) and human-curated data to return an answer including graphs and other representations. The ontologies and data are managed by Wolfram employees who must input new ontologies and data by hand or, occasionally, with the assistance of programmatic tools. It is expected that an Application Programming Interface (API) will eventually be available, although it is not known what the API will be used for.\nUnlike traditional search engines Wolfram Alpha does not search online documents, and thus does not return answers to \"fuzzy\" questions, such as opinion or advice. Instead, the scope of answers is limited to the knowledge that has already been modeled and encoded in the ontologies and the associated data. In this way the system can generate knowledge that was previously unknown. It is thought that while Wolfram will concentrate on scientific and technical information the system may eventually be able to answer questions in other domains, such as stock information, geography and history. In theory, any question with a factual answer could be answered by Wolfram Alpha."}

According to prosecutors, Foley \"loathed Dr. Yelenic\" so much that he asked another fellow trooper to help him commit the alleged murder, which occurred in Yelenic's Blairsville home.\nDeputy Attorney General Anthony Krastek told an Indiana County jury that Foley also prayed Yelenic would die, and spread false rumors that Yelenic molested his adopted son.\n\"You will see Kevin Foley has the motive, the opportunity and the ability to commit this crime, almost to the exclusion of anybody else,\" Krastek said.\nFoley's defense attorney, Jeffrey Monzo, said during opening statements that DNA evidence was not conclusive. Monzo admitted to the jury that Foley did not like Yelenic, but said that does not mean he murdered him. \n\u201cKevin Foley is innocent,\u201d he said.\nProsecutors said they could call as many as 70 witnesses to try and prove Foley wanted Yelenic to die. The trial, at the Indiana County Courthouse, is expected to last about three weeks.\nFoley, who is on unpaid suspension from the Pennsylvania State Police, is charged with criminal homicide. The jury has the option of convicting him of first-degree murder, which could put Foley in prison for life without parole, or of a lesser degree charge, like manslaughter.\nJohn Yelenic was found dead in his home on April 13, 2006, one day before he was planning on signing his divorce papers. Prosecutors said Foley killed Yelenic after going to the dentist's house to confront him over the terms of the divorce. Prosecutors claim Foley slashed Yelenic several times with a knife and pushed his head through a small window, causing a further gash on his neck. Yelenic bled to death. \nFoley had been living with Michele Yelenic for two years at the time of the alleged homicide. Krastek said Michele also helped perpetuate rumors that Dr. Yelenic molested their son. John and Michele Yelenic had been separated in 2002. Michele Yelenic stood to collect Dr. Yelenic's estate and a $1 million life insurance policy, and could lose about $2,500 a month in support if the divorce was finalized, a Pennsylvania grand jury previously determined.\nMichele Yelenic is expected to testify that Foley was home with her when the alleged murder occurred. Krastek told the jury DNA under Yelenic's fingerprints will ultimately link him to the murder, as will bloody shoe prints found at the crime scene that match athletic shoes Foley is known to wear.\nMonzo also said authorities have failed to investigate several other suspects, including Yelenic's neighbor. Monzo said Yelenic was on very friendly terms with the neighbor's wife, which could have given him a motive to commit the murder.\nPrior to the trial, Foley's defense attorneys unsuccessfully sought a change of venue because an overwhelming majority of the jury pool was familiar with the allegations. The change was denied when jurors insisted they had not formed an opinion about the charges."}

A further seven female students were injured. There are conflicting reports if a tenth student died from injuries later. Other students were injured as they attempted to escape by jumping out of windows.\nPolice received a call within three minutes at 9:33 a.m. the police entered the school at 9:40 a.m. to discover the bodies of the slain victims. A pupil managed to call for help using a mobile phone, and the headmaster apparently gave an early warning via the intercom so that some of the teachers were able to lock the doors to their classrooms from the inside, probably preventing more killings. From the first floor of the school, Kretschmer fired at the first police who arrived on the scene.\nKretschmer fled the school as further police arrived, and killed a gardener in a nearby clinic as he did so. \nAs the police evacuated the 1,000 pupil secondary school, \nKretschmer, hijacked a Volkswagen Sharan and forced the driver to drive him south. Slowed by a traffic jam Kretschmer forced the driver to drive towards Wendlingen.\nA police checkpoint was not able to apprehend Kretschmer. The car went off the road, and the gunman fled into an industrial area in Wendlingen about 40 kilometres (25 miles) from the school. \nTracked by specialist armed police and police spotters in helicopters Kretschmer was finally cornered in the carpark of a car dealership in Wendlingen. Kretschmer, the son of a well known local farmer and businessman, made a last stand and killed a salesman and a customer before being shot by police marksmen being injured in the leg. At first it was unclear if the shooting killed him or if he was wounded and then shot himself. Police now believe that the evidence points to suicide.\nDuring the manhunt, police stormed the youth's home in Leutenbach to conduct a search. Kretschmer's father, a hobbyist hunter, legally owned 15 firearms and one was missing from the collection. The majority of the firearms were kept securely locked as German law mandates, however a handgun was kept in the parent's bedroom and it is this weapon that is presumed to have been used. Also, all the ammunition was not locked away, and Kretschmer reportedly carried a \"3-digit figure\" of ammunition with him.\nThe police are still uncertain about the motive, as Kretschmer was known as a calm, inconspicuous person to the people who knew him personally. He didn't have a criminal record and has apparently not made any announcements of his killing spree, neither online nor to any of his friends.\nKretschmer had been a graduate of Albertville school the previous year.\nTwo police officers remain in serious condition."}

Justice Gerald Allbright, in his instructions to the sequestered jury, has advised the jurors that they may consider the charges of second-degree murder, manslaughter or discharging a firearm with intent to wound or endanger life, but not the charge of first-degree murder the Crown has sought.\nDagenais has entered a plea of not guilty by reason of self defense. He is charged with two counts first degree murder and one count of attempted murder in the Spiritwood Incident.\nConstable Michelle Knopp survived the shoot-out which erupted after a high speed chase ended about from Spiritwood, Saskatchewan near Mildred. Constables Marc Bourdages and Robin Cameron died about one week following the shoot out which occurred July 7, 2006.\nDefense lawyer Bill Roe argued self defense for Dagenais, saying he shot \"in a blind panic\" when RCMP officers fired upon him.\nCrown prosecutor Al Johnston asserted that Dagenais shot first. Johnston asserted that Dagenais cannot be believed, that his story is presented so he can get away with murder.\nThe incident began with a dispute within the Dagenais family. The defendant supported his father Arthur Dagenais, and his sister supported the mother Elise Dagenais, during a divorce; his mother was to receive half the family farm from the divorce which she had previously allocated to Dagenais. Dagenais tried to speak to his mother, but the sister intervened.\nDagenais reported going to the local RCMP detachment and spoke with Constable Cameron. Constable Knopp informed Dagenais that the RCMP could not be involved in a family affair.\nAfter Dagenais' sister and mother went to the police, the three constables went to charge Dagenais with assault.\nThis is where the stories from the RCMP and Dagenais diverge. Dagenais claims that Cameron made the intial approach to arrest him and smashed his truck window, at which point Dagenais became scared and sped away from the situation. The RCMP state that Dagenais started to drive away from the situation which meant that Cameron was hit by the truck's rear view mirror. Cameron retaliated by breaking the window. Officers Cameron and Bourdages followed the departing Dagenais in a police truck; Knopp followed in a SUV. \nDuring the chase police sideswiped Dagenais' truck. The RCMP say that Dagenais was unpredictable and that he had rammed their vehicle. The RCMP tried prevent Dagenais from reaching his father's farm house fearing that there were firearms there.\nThere is a difference in accounts of the chase and gun battle. Dagenais claims the RCMP fired upon him first, and he fired back in self defence fearing for his life.\nThe chase ended after RCMP rammed into the side of Dagenais' stopped truck. Because Dagenais was already stopped, according to collision reconstruction expert, there was time for Dagenais to shoot at the RCMP truck. A firearm expert studying trajectories of the bullets found that one of the rounds fired from Daganais' .30-30 Winchester entered the police vehicle at a different angle than other shots fired at the truck after the collision.\nDagenais has also reported holes in his truck door.\nDagenais claims when he heard the second vehicle drive up, there was more gun fire so he returned shots himself.\nKnopp testifed that she arrived at the scene in the second vehicle her ear was struck by a fragment from bullet fire. She said when she arrived Daganais fired first and that Bourdages and Cameron were already badly wounded.\nFirearms experts established that Dagenais fired eight times, and the RCMP six times during the gunfight.\nDuring the trial evidence was presented that Dagenais had previously been assaulted by police. The RCMP had identified Daganais as a police hater. There had been previous altercations between the RCMP, Daganais and his father. Dagenais had filed prior lawsuits against the RCMP.\nFollowing the incident, Dagenias fled the scene hiding in the woods of the countryside. 200 RCMP engaged in a massive manhunt. Dagenais turned himself in July 18, 2006.\nThe audio from the RCMP radio was submitted as evidence, and the dispatcher had opened all the channels associated with the Shellbrook area. There is no reporting of gunfire recorded on the audio.\nThere was no videotape in the onboard video camera installed in Knopp's SUV when evidence was gathered two days following the shooting. A photograph of three VHS tapes in Knopp's vehicle has been presented. Constable Kenneth Palen after viewing a tape, testified he was instructed not to keep the videotape found on the passenger seat of the SUV and it was destroyed in the garbage."}

The further delay of launch was due to a hydrogen fuel leak. Discovery was previously set to liftoff tonight at 9:20 p.m. (EDT).\n\"Space shuttle Discovery\u2019s launch to the International Space Station (ISS) now is targeted for no earlier than March 15. Liftoff on March 15 would be at 7:43 p.m. EDT. The exact launch date is dependent on the work necessary to repair the problem,\" said NASA in a statement on their website.\nNASA said during a press conference today that the leak is likely being caused by a hardware issue, later announced to be a suspect connector on the gaseous vent line attached to the shuttle's external tank. Troubleshooting the problem is scheduled to begin on March 12.\nDiscovery's original proposed launch was for July of 2008. Later it was changed to December 4, 2008. The next change scheduled the liftoff date for February 12, 2009. It was then delayed until February 27, but was then delayed indefinitely on February 20 after NASA discovered an issue with the hydrogen control valves.\nThe current scheduled mission is set to fly the Integrated Truss Structure segment to the ISS, and to install the final set of power-generating solar arrays . The arrays consist of two 115-foot-long arrays, for a total span of 240 feet, including the equipment that connects the two halves and allows them to twist as they track the sun. Altogether, the four sets of arrays can generate 84 to 120 kilowatts of electricity \u2013 enough to provide power for more than 40 average homes.\nCommander Lee Archambault will lead Discovery's crew of seven, along with Pilot Tony Antonelli, and Mission Specialists Joseph Acaba, John Phillips, Steve Swanson, Richard Arnold, and Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency astronaut Koichi Wakata."}

All wild boars that have escaped to roam wild should be killed, according to the resolution.\nAgriculture Minister Bob Bjornerud endorses a ban on wild boar farming. The wild boar population is expanding exponentially. There are over 2,000 feral \"Sus scrofa\" swine roaming the prairies. Two litters of approximately 12 piglets are sired by each wild boar sow every year. \nThe Saskatchewan Wildlife Federation (SWF) likewise passed a similar resolution at their 79th annual convention to urge the Saskatchewan Government to declare the wild boar as a nuisance species which can be killed on sight.\n3% of farmed \"wild\" boars escape. Cells of wild boars are ravenous creatures killing and eating everything in their path. Horses, cows, and other livestock run from wild boars, breaking through fences in the process.\nOstriches, emus, llamas, alpacas, reindeer, wild boar, and fallow deer were amongst the animals introduced to farms in Saskatchewan during the agricultural diversification program in the late 1970s. Production of wild boars was promoted throughout the 1980s.\nAccording to the Saskatchewan Agriculture and Food 2001 statistics, there were 150 wild boar producers raising approximately 15,000 and 20,000 head. Of these there were about 2,700 sows. On the 2006 Census of Agriculture, 401 farms reported 4,926 boars.\nThe boar's red meat is an export commodity to Europe and Asia. The live breeding stock are also sold to trophy hunt ranches. Full blooded wild boar and hybrid crosses are raised."}

The Queensland Greens are one of these parties.\nWikinews reporter held an exclusive over-the-phone interview with Greens candidate for the electoral district of Maroochydore, Brenton Clutterbuck.\nMr. Clutterbuck is a graduate of Sunshine Coast Grammar School and is currently studying Education at the University of the Sunshine Coast. \nQueensland's unicameral parliament is up for election on March 21. The election campaign will run for a total of 26 days following the issue of the writs by Governor Penelope Wensley.\nInterview.\nWhy do you want to get into parliament?\nThe main reason is because the electorate is badly underrepresented. There are only two other candidates in this electorate, the Labor Party and the LNP. Both have poor environmental policy. \nWhat would the three main policies you are taking into this election be?\nHow would you address these policies?\nBasically aim to support as many positive bills as possible. If the positive bill is not introduced then you introduce the bill. Through cooperation with other members you get things done. Whether others listen is another question. You should always do what\u2019s in the best interests of the electorate\nYou recently gave comment to the Sunshine Coast Daily about uranium mining in Queensland. Does the LNPs position have merit or should they directly invest in renewable energy technology?\nThere is no merit to it, or to Labor's proposal to invest in uranium. We want to have a nuclear free Australia and no nuclear waste. Don\u2019t send overseas where the disposal is up to other countries.\nWhich renewable energy technology would you prefer to see invested in most?\nSolar. Absolutely solar, it\u2019s the oldest and most familiar. We know a lot about solar. We know more about solar than any other technology. I\u2019m getting this from a speech by Ronan Lee \u201cWe will build two new solar thermal power stations, one near Townsville and one on the Darling Downs, creating jobs, reducing pollution and making electricity cheaper.\u201d\nIn a recent article I wrote about McDonald\u2019s appeal against a council decision, you commented that Labor and the LNP [Liberal National party] had a long history of being pro big business. Would you be willing to introduce policy to the contrary?\nIt\u2019s not a problem. It\u2019s a problem that big business has influence in those parties. It\u2019s like Springborg with the uranium business donations. Big business should not be directing policy \nShould big business back off and respect the community?\nShould always respect the community desires. Community always votes with its feet. Where there is a conflict of interest, business should always respect the community. As I said before, big business should not be directing policy."}

Though covered with mud, he was still smiling as he was 23 and a half years before. In October 1985, the statue was tossed into the river by some overjoyed fans of the Hanshin Tigers baseball team, which led to a 'legend' known as \"the Curse of Colonel Sanders.\" \nOn Tuesday afternoon, the upper body of the reinforced plastic statue was found unexpectedly. Osaka City had a plan to lay a paved path along D\u014dtonbori River, and a contractor diver noticed a figure near the bottom while checking for unexploded World War II bombs. The workers pulled it up, and Tigers fans among them recognized the figure as the Colonel. The lower body was also found on Wednesday morning. The statue still lacks some parts like eyeglasses, feet and left hand, but the contractor reportedly says it's almost impossible for the rest to be found, due to lack of visibility in the water. \nOsaka City will return the statue, about 180 cm in height, to KFC Japan. Reportedly the company is considering displaying the statue at its franchise in the Tigers home Hanshin K\u014dshien Stadium in Nishinomiya City, Hy\u014dgo Prefecture (neighboring Osaka Pref.). \nThe story of the Hanshin Tigers and the Colonel statue dates back to October 1985. Because the team got the Central League title for the first time in 21 years, ecstatic fans crowded around D\u014dtonbori. Some were so overjoyed that they jumped into the river for the team players. Unfortunately no one among them looked like Randy Bass, the team's star slugger. Near them was a KFC franchise (closed 1998), and they presumably found resemblance between Bass and 'Colonel' Sanders (both were bearded). They started to chant \"Baassu, Baassu\" and tossed the Colonel statue into the river in honor of their hero. The team also won the Japan Series later in that year. \nHowever, this was the Hanshin Tigers' last triumph. The team soon fell into a long-term slump, and finished at the bottom among 6 Central League teams in 10 of 16 seasons by 2001. During the slump, some baseball lovers in Japan jokingly said \"it was brought by the Curse of Colonel Sanders,\" which became a legend. The Tigers again got the League title in 2003 and 2005, but the fans' dream of another triumph has not yet come true. \nAsked whether the 'curse' will be lifted by the discovery, Hanshin Tigers manager Akinobu Mayumi said \"now we can not lay (our luck) to it.\" A KFC Japan press officer said, \"Truly, Sanders is a 'gentleman'. The 'curse' must end, and he must back Hanshin up to be a Japan Series Champion.\" "}

Hatshepsut reigned approximately 1479\u20131458 BCE. Djehuty was responsible for managing the huge amounts of precious goods brought in from Egypt's military expedition to Punt in the Horn of Africa and the vast building projects of Hatshepsut which have made the female pharaoh one of the most-remembered of any from ancient Egypt.\nDjehuty died after Hatshepsut did, sometime during the reign of Thutmosis III. Both Hatshepsut's and Thutmosis's names are recorded on the tomb. In a fashion typical of ancient Egyptian rivalries, Hatshepsut's name was partly obscured on the monument over the tomb sometime after the queen's death.\nThe team, led by Jos\u00e9 Manuel Gal\u00e1n of the National Research Center (Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cient\u00edficas, CSIC), in Madrid, Spain, had been excavating the tomb, designated TT11 and located in the necropolis of Dra' Abu el-Naga', since 2002. While much of Djehuty's funerary equipment was lost to fire in antiquity, the lower chamber of his tomb was concealed at the end of a three-meter shaft and discovered at the end of 2008. \nA superficial description of the tomb itself was recorded almost two hundred years ago by 19th-century French Egyptologist Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Champollion, rubble blocking the entrance hindered excavation until the 21st century. In that time, emphasis in Egyptology has changed from the cataloging of treasures to the investigation of ancient culture, life and religion.\nSince excavation began, Djehuty's tomb has yielded a number of surprises. It was discovered that the tomb was re-used repeatedly up to and during the Greco-Roman period. There is an unusual face-on depiction of pharaoh Thutmosis III hunting ducks, and the mummy of a young, bejewelled, as-yet unidentified woman. \nIn 2007, 44 preserved bunches of flowers thought to be from Djehuty's funeral were found in the site. In their 8th season of excavation, which ended on February 22, 2009, the team also found considerable evidence that below Djehuty's tomb is a network of burial sites from the 11th dynasty, four thousand years old.\nThe lower chamber also displays passages from the Egyptian funerary text the Book of the Dead on its walls and a colorful mural of the goddess Nut, an embodiment of the heavens, on the ceiling. The names of Djehuty and his parents were also intact in the second chamber; the names were defaced in the previously-known first chamber of the tomb, which had also been looted.\nAccording to a press release from Dr. Zahi Hawass, Secretary General of Egypt\u2019s Supreme Council of Antiquities, Djehuty's tomb is only the fifth known decorated burial chamber of the 18th dynasty. An additional unusual feature of the tomb is that its upper chamber is decorated in relief, rather than simply paint. When the excavation is completed, Dr Gal\u00e1n's team plans to open the site to the public as the carved stoneworks will not be destroyed by tourists' activities as paint would.\nThe identification of Djehuty is a complicated one, as a number of officials of the 18th dynasty bore the name, including a general and several governors. The name itself is an alternate transliteration of the name of the Egyptian god usually written in English as Thoth."}

One of them resulted in British Airways Flight 38 crashing short of the runway at London's Heathrow Airport last year. The NTSB and the AAIB want Rolls-Royce to redesign the engines.\nBoth events occurred on Boeing 777-200ER airplanes powered by Rolls-Royce RB211 Trent 800 Series engines. On January 17, 2008 British Airways Flight 38 experienced a dual engine rollback (reduction of engine power) on final approach to Heathrow and crashed, leaving one passenger seriously injured, eight passengers and four of the flight crew with minor injuries and the airplane written off.\nThe second event occurred on November 26, 2008, when a Delta Air Lines Boeing 777 experienced a single engine rollback during cruise flight over Montana, United States while en route from Shanghai to Atlanta. Normal operations resumed after the flight crew followed Boeing's published procedure to recover engine performance and the airplane landed safely in Atlanta.\nBoeing has already developed new procedures after the crash to prevent ice from building up within their 777 fuel systems after it became apparent that icing may have been a factor, and it was some of these that the Delta flight crew had followed. Boeing modified these further after the Delta incident. As part of the recent releases by the NTSB and AAIB it has become apparent that investigators from both bodies, which are collaborating, have found ice buildup in the fuel system caused both rollbacks.\nIn both cases a build-up of ice (from water normally present in all jet fuel) developed on a component called the fuel/oil heat exchanger. This restricted the flow of fuel to the engine, resulting in the uncommanded engine rollback. Investigators initially struggled to produce enough ice under test conditions but have now found that at high concentration, fuel can form ice at very low temperatures in enough quantity to seriously restrict fuel flow, according to a new interim report by the AAIB. This does not occur when fuel demand is lower, as the hot oil then becomes sufficient to entirely melt the ice. The British jet experienced very low temperatures over Siberia. \nThe vigorous tests are thought to be the first of their kind. They have also confirmed that while ice may have formed elsewhere in the airliner's fuel system fuel was probably not restricted at any other location. Instead, it is thought 'soft' ice formed in the pipes and then broke off, travelling to the fuel/oil heat exchanger and restricting it.\nThe NTSB has now revealed that they have advised Rolls-Royce to redesign the fuel/oil heat exchanger, and Rolls-Royce have stated that they are indeed working on a replacement part that will be available within twelve months. The AAIB advised Boeing and Rolls-Royce to jointly review the problem across the fuel system, and both companies responded that they 'accepted' this recommendation and repeated that a replacement part was being developed.\nBoth the NTSB and the AAIB also sent letters to the US Federal Aviation Administration and the European Aviation Safety Agency requesting the installment of the modified component be mandatory. The NTSB suggested this should be either the next maintenance check or within six months. There are 220 Boeing 777-200s - the only type using the affected engine - with Trent 800 series engines.\nThe fuel/oil heat exchanger is a dual purpose part designed to simultaneously melt fuel ice and cool down engine oil.\nThe AAIB further noted that it is unclear weather other aircraft designs are at risk, and advised the FAA and EASA to look into increased use of de-icing additives and investigate both the accumulation and sudden movement of ice in aircraft fuel systems and the actual formation of ice in the fuel itself."}

This was mainly due to bank shares bouncing and alleviating fears about the economy.\nThe Dow Jones industrial average (INDU) finished on 7223.98, an increase of 54 points from March 12 2009. The S&amp;P 500 Index finished at 756.55 a 6 point gain and the NASDAQ composite had a 5.40 point gain as well to end the day at 1431.50.\nThe rally began earlier this week after the news from Citigroup Inc. about managing profits during first two months of the year. The news lessened fears about the country's major financial institutions collapsing after the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September. There was more good news from Bank of America Corp. and JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co., who announced that they have had profits in the current year.\nToday was a mixed day for the financial sector, Drug makers had some gains and so did General Motors and Berkshire Hathaway , which helped the indexes gain. The value of the US dollar fell against other world currencies, but gold prices increased."}

Bush, which made the term an important aspect of his legal construct for dealing with terrorism suspects.\nThe United States Department of Justice filed the order in response to a federal judge's order seeking a definition of the term. Judges have said the definition will play a key role in determining whether the government has justified the confinement of many detainees who are challenging their status in U.S. District Court.\nThe Justice Department said it would only seek to detain those who \"substantially supported\" the Taliban, Al Qaeda or associated groups that participated in the September 11 terrorist attacks. The term \"substantially supported\" was not defined, but that classification would not include groups who \"provide unwitting or insignificant support\" to terror groups, according to court papers.\n\"The particular facts and circumstances justifying detention will vary from case to case, and may require the identification and analysis of various analogues from traditional international armed conflicts,\" government lawyers wrote in court papers. \"Accordingly, the contours of the 'substantial support' and 'associated forces' bases of detention will need to be further developed in their application to concrete facts in individual cases.\"\nThis, too, was a break from the Bush administration, which has argued it can detain those who provided support to those groups, as well as those who \"engaged in hostilities\" against the United States and its allies.\n Although detainees have argued in lawsuits that only those directly involved in terrorist hostilities should be held, the Justice Department filing continues to assert Obama's authority to hold detainees even if they were not captured on the battlefield. However, Obama says he will rely on that authority from Congress and international laws of war, not the wartime authority that Bush claimed which stemmed from congressional authorization.\nObama plans to close the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base detention camp within a year and determine where to place the 240 detainees currently held there.\n\"As we work towards developing a new policy to govern detainees, it is essential that we operate in a manner that strengthens our national security, is consistent with our values and is governed by law,\" said Attorney General Eric Holder in a statement."}

The figure is about ten times higher than the original estimate of twenty thousand litres of oil. The devastating diesel oil spill has spread along of the Queensland coast. In addition, 31 containers with 620 tonnes of ammonium nitrate fertiliser flew overboard during the violent storm.\nQuestions are being asked why the Hong Kong cargo ship was out in seas with nine meter waves caused by Cyclone Hamish, a Category 5 tropical cyclone, as well as why the fertiliser containers were not properly secured. One of the overboard containers ruptured the hull of the Pacific Adventurer, causing between 30 to 100 tonnes of oil to spew from the severely damaged ship. \nIf the ammonium nitrate mixes with the heavy oil, an explosion could occur. None of the containers have been recovered. Some of these may float, but it is believed that they may have sunk which then may cause algal blooms.\nDisaster zones have been declared at Bribie and Moreton Islands, and along the Sunshine coast. \nThe vessel's owner, Swire Shipping, reported that a second leak began on Friday, when the ship began listing after docking at Hamilton for repairs. \"As full soundings of the vessel's tanks were being taken at the port to determine how much oil had leaked from the vessel, a small quantity of fuel oil escaped from the Pacific Adventurer,\" it stated. The ship was brought upright, and a recovery vessel was used to suck up the oil from the water. The leak produced a 500m-long oil slick down the Brisbane River. Booms were placed around this oil spill so that a skimmer could clean up the second spill.\nSwire Shipping could face clean up costs of AU$100,000 a day as well as fines up to AU$1.5million (US$977,000; \u00a3703,000) if found guilty of environmental breaches or negligence.\nSunshine Coast beaches are slowly starting to be reopened. The beach of Mooloolaba was still closed following reports of burning sensations from swimmers. 12 beaches remain closed; however, 13 have been reopened.\nOver 300 state government and council workers are using buckets, rakes and spades in the clean up effort. Sunshine Coast Mayor Bob Abbott says the majority will be gone by Sunday afternoon. The full environmental impact on wildlife is not yet known. One turtle and seven pelicans have been found covered in oil.\nThere are concerns that the drinking water of Moreton Island is at risk, as the island uses water from the underground water table near the oil spill site.\n\"Every bucketload of contaminated sand has to be removed from the island by barge, and each bucketload from a front-end loader weighs about one tonne. It's just an impossible task,\u201d said Mr Trevor Hassard of the Tangalooma Dolphin Education Centre.\nThe commercial fishing industry has suffered from the incident. Trawlers won't resume operations until Sunday evening, and any catches will be tested for human consumption."}

Rico has been in a variety of jobs but his passion is now his profession - he turns unwanted 'junk' into unusual pieces of furniture. Rico's creations and the methods used to fabricate them are the subject of the \"Salvager\" shows.\nRico spoke to \"Wikinews\" in January about his inspiration and early life, future plans, other hobbies and more. Read on for the full exclusive interview, published for the first time:\nInterview.\nHow was it you first came to be interested in salvaging?\nI grew up in Basildon New Town very close to the enormous spoil heap that later became the green hills of Gloucester Park. There was all sorts of stuff dumped by developers and local businesses that was pure treasure trove to all the London kids that had moved down there. I suppose I was actively seeking play material from as young as 5 I suppose. My dad had big plans for me and tended to buy me \"educational\" stuff for Xmas. Things like encyclopaedias, microscope, chemistry set. That sort of stuff. Great for the brain but not what you'd call a toy. I ended up playing with my dad's tools and using whatever I could drag off the spoil heap as material.\nWhat makes 'good' rubbish, and how do you tell it apart from other junk?\nI dont look at junk as junk. To me its raw material like any other but with added benefits. I like to preserve the patina of age and sometimes decay where it brings an interesting element to a build. Faded paintwork and oxidised metal are dripping with history and add shedloads of character to anything they're included in. Materials obviously have to be sound and usable otherwise you'd just be using crap to make more crap.\nWhat differences are there between salvaging in your home of France and back here in Britain, and what simply doesn't change when you cross the border?\nThe advantages of France as a source of build material is that there are so many more opportunities to chance on stuff that may be 2 or even 3 centuries old. Hand made hinges and latches, ancient oak boards etc. My favourite hunting places are the ashes of old farmers fires . I pull out astonishingly interesting bits of hand forged ironwork. The thing that stays constant from one country to the other is that people can have amazingly good stuff but see little or no value in it leaving the field wide open for anyone that has a little vision.\nYou say on your website that you are working on an idea for a new show. Can you tell us a bit more about that?\nTheres not much I can say about doing a new show apart from the fact that whatever I did I would insist on retaining my integrity. My shows have all been optimistic and upbeat which I would have thought the essential ingredients of any TV to take us through a recession. Don't think I could do the nasty vote -the -others off type show. I certainly wouldn't be happy adhering to the clicheed scripts so many celebs seem happy to stick to and you will never see Rico Daniels wearing a frock on the Paul O Grady show. Seems a step too low for a bit of cash.\nWhen you go out looking for materials, presumably you never know what you're going to find. When you look at what's available, how do you come up with a vision of what you're going to make from it?\nThe best work I do grows over time. I have hundreds of galvanised boxes full of \"components\". I like assembling the elements of a build to be like a piece of art. TV demands a faster pace than I normally like which was fun though at some point I would like people to see what can really be created with a bit of care and careful planning. \nYou are also into a bit of axe throwing, I understand. Do you ever do this competitively?\nMy axe throwing which has been more implied than seen was something that I started doing at \"western\" camps in Germany. It was organised as a competition there hitting a range of targets on marked posts. I use it now as a way of letting off steam. I also throw circular saw blades usually at a target I call WMD Tony. Chills you right out.\nAs you rightly mentioned when you announced your new show concept, it is very hard to get a hold of money these days in any sizable amount - people are holding on to it. What effect has this got on salvaging - will it encourage it as people look for alternatives, or will the supply of cheap materials be decreased?\nI have always found an increase in the amount of stuff available in a recession. A lot more people turn to DIY, ripping out salvageable stuff that a man such as myself could use. I have seen tons of good gear as Ive been going round London over the last fortnight. It broke my heart to leave it in the skips.\nBetween writing for Brit Chopper magazine and customizing your jeep, you clearly enjoy the open road. What do you look for in a vehicle? Given the chance to have any one ride you wanted, what would you be driving?\nAs far as vehicles, go, the Jeep Wrangler presses all the right buttons for me. It is totally suited to the area I live and though an accursed 4x4 I plan my trips carefully to do as many things on a single journey as possible. I would lay money that I create less CO2 than a lot of eco drivers in \"green\" vehicles and what I do create I hope is being absorbed by the huge number of maturing trees I planted on my own land. I would like to build a trike for France though the French law is difficult in respect of a custom vehicle. Hopefully there will be a way through the red tape and I can get one under way. I also have an emergency 250 in the barn that so aint as harley I ain't gonna dignify it with a description.\nExternal links.\n "}

The electricity will power vehicles as well. Boats and automobiles with gasoline engines would be slowly replaced with electric versions.\nThe plan will cost an estimated US$1.1 billion. The economy of the Maldives, reliant mainly on tourism and fishing, is worth $800 million a year.\nEnvironmentalist Mark Lynas said that the plan could pay for itself in a decade, due to savings on oil imports. \"It's going to cost a lot of money but it will also save a lot of money from not having to import oil,\" Lynas said.\n\"The point of doing it is that it is something the Maldives can lead the world in. No rich country has the excuse that it is too expensive and we can't do anything,\" Lynas said to the news agency Reuters.\n\"The Maldives could just give up. Its people could declare themselves climate change refugees and ask for sanctuary elsewhere. But the new government is taking a stand and asked us to give them a plan for a near zero-carbon economy,\" said Chris Goodall, the British climate change expert who led the development of the carbon-neutral plan. \"We don't want to pretend that this plan is going to be easy to implement. There will be hiccups, and electricity supply will occasionally be disrupted. But we think that building a near-zero-carbon Maldives is a realistic challenge. Get it right and we will show the apathetic developed world that action is possible, and at reasonable cost.\"\nThe Maldives are located in the Indian ocean and are among the lowest-lying islands on the planet, with none of them rising more than six feet (1.8 metres) above sea level, making them particularly vulnerable to rising sea levels associated with global warming."}

He also said that he didn't expect any of the US's largest banks to fail. However, he stressed that the prospects of ending the economic downturn in 2009 probably relied on getting the financial markets working normally and making the banks to lend more freely again.\n\"We've seen some progress in the financial markets, absolutely. But until we get that stabilized and working normally, we're not going to see recovery. But we do have a plan. We're working on it. And, I do think that we will get it stabilized, and we'll see the recession coming to an end probably this year,\" he said.\nBernanke noted that he expects the unemployment rate will continue rising above the current 25-year high of 8.1% even if the government is able to end the 15-month recession.\nThe chairman said that the largest possible danger now was the absence of \"political will\" to fix the economy.\nBernanke is the first incumbent Federal Reserve chairman to take a television interview for two decades. The chairman said that he decided to do so because it was an \"extraordinary time\" for the US, and it gave him an opportunity to speak directly to the public."}

Although El Salvador's Supreme Electoral Tribunal has not yet certified a winner, Funes shows an insurmountable lead in the results, besting Alianza Republicana Nacionalista (ARENA) candidate Rodrigo \u00c1vila by a margin of 51.27% to 48.73%, with 90.68% of votes counted. \u00c1vila conceded defeat, vowing that ARENA would remain vigorous in opposition. \nFunes' victory marks a major shift in the politics of the country: ARENA has controlled the presidency of El Salvador since the end of El Salvador's civil war in 1991. The FMLN was founded by Marxist guerrillas who fought in the civil war. When the guerrillas and the government signed a peace agreement in 1992, the FMLN became a political party. \nFunes, a former television journalist, is the first FMLN leader not to have been an combatant in the war. In his victory speech in San Salvador Sunday night, he said: \"I want to be the real president of the real reconstruction of the country, which starts with the reconstruction of people.\"\n\"I want to thank all the people who voted for me and chose that path of hope and change,\" added Funes. \nDuring the polarizing electoral campaign, \u00c1vila tied the FMLN to communism and said that an FMLN victory would turn El Salvador into a satellite of Hugo Ch\u00e1vez's Venezuela. Discontent with unemployment, gang violence and corruption under the government of ARENA president Antonio \"Tony\" Saca trumped concerns that the FMLN would return to its radical roots or spoil El Salvador's historically close relationship with the United States.\nAbout 60% of the electorate voted, including thousands who returned to the country from the United States in order to cast ballots."}

He lured her to the basement where she was locked in a room, handcuffed and drugged. He is charged with incest, false imprisonment, murder, rape and the enslavement. The murder charge stems from allegations that Fritzl murdered a twin of one of the children. He then disposed of the body by placing the corpse into a heated oven, burning the body. Police say the child had died shortly after being born.\nPolice became suspicious when a 19-year-old daughter, Kerstin, was taken to hospital with a mysterious life-threatening illness, and the family's medical records were checked. Police say that Elisabeth F. appeared to be \"greatly disturbed\" psychologically, and only agreed to talk after the authorities assured her that she would not have to have contact with her father, and that her children would be cared for. When authorities arrived at his home, Fritzl told police what he had done. Of the surviving six children, there are three boys and three girls, between 5 and 20 years old.\nThe 27 page indictment says that Fritzl \"had equipped it [the cellar] with a double bed, a wash basin, a toilet, a TV, a video recorder, an oven and plastic crockery. In the cellar there was no daylight or fresh air. The only opportunity to wash was in a sink, there was no shower. There was also no hot water or heating.\" The indictment also stated that Fritzl's actions were \"premeditated.\"\nFritzl's lawyer, Rudolf Mayer, opened the trial saying that Fritzl was \"not a monster\" and that Fritzl \"was scared [and] regrets his actions\". As a precaution to prevent media infiltration and Fritzl's escape, authorities issued a no-fly warning above the courtroom. \nFritzl was arrested on April 27, 2008, in his home in Amstetten and if convicted, he would spend the rest of his life behind bars without the possibility of parole. The minimum sentence is said to be at least 15 years in prison. The trial is expected to last one week. "}

The occupation of the palace follows a long chain of events which includes Mr Rajoelina's January 31 declaration that he would \"run all national affairs\" of the country.

Fire fighting systems will be examined by the fire brigade and the public works department (PWD) to ensure functionality. Security measures will be enhanced supplementing areas under private security such as at the Bashundhara City Complex.\nThe Fire Service and Civil Defence Department requires modernization and needs new equipment to fight fires past the sixth floor of buildings. The Fire Brigade says it needs turntable ladders, snorkels, foam-tenders, lighting units, emergency tenders, fireproof uniforms, and rescue ropes for fire fighting and rescue operations. Transportation to fires is also an issue due to narrow roads, low electrical wires and congestion.\nThe Bangladesh National Building Code requires fire fighting equipment installed in buildings over seven floors. This code is to be monitored by authorities to ensure compliance with the new guidelines and to make sure buildings are being maintained.\nThe Bashundhara City Complex opened Monday for shoppers two days after Friday's blaze. A probe is underway to determine the cause of the fire and to assess structural damage.\nLoss of life was minimized as the blaze broke out on a Friday, the beginning of the weekend in Bangladesh, so offices in the upper floors were empty. The lower eight floors are used for shopping and the upper floors are all Bashundhara Group offices.\nThe mall is valued at Tk 7.0 billion (US$100 million). It is not known if the complex is covered by fire insurance.\nIt is estimated that it will take over two years to rebuild the area damaged by flames which were burned down to a skeleton. Bashundhara City's technical advisor, Latifur Rahman, estimated damages at Tk 2.0 billion (US$29m).\nOnly one television cameraman has been allowed in to film the burnt area. None of the 2,500 shops, cinemas or cafes were burnt by the inferno. The seventh and eighth floors still experience smoke damage, and there was water damage to merchandise.\nA three member committee is currently investigating the cause of the fire which will consist of Iqbal Khan Chowdhury, joint secretary of the ministry, representatives of the police, IGP Noor Muhammad, and fire brigade, Director General Abu Nayeem Md Shahidullah. The committee is required to report within the week with their findings. The forensics department is also sifting through the burnt remains.\nThe Dhaka Chamber of Commerce and Industries has also formed a committee which has begun interviewing witnesses and recording their testimony alongside the government committee.\nIt has been discovered that 150 closed circuit cameras were not being used when the fire started. Another mystery is why the mall fire fighting system has been found unused.\n\"In the shopping mall there is an ultra-technology elevator which runs even without electricity but we have found that locked,\" Iqbal Khan Chowdhury, joint secretary (Police) of the home ministry, said. \"Why the fire burnt so fiercely is a matter to think. We have to see if there was any incendiary substance there. These matters seem to be mysterious.\"\nMall management has been asked to submit substances and items which would have been in the upper floors when the fire started. The fire erupted on the 17th floor and spread quickly to the two floors above and engulfed the three floors below. The aerial ladders belonging to the Fire Service and Civil Defence reached as high as the 13th floor of the 21-storey building.\nVideos have been sent to the United States (US) for examination to assist in determining the cause of the fire and to help in the damage assessment. Experts from the US are expected to arrive soon.\nFirefighters were brought to the rooftop of the 20-storey tower by helicopter. The only fatality in this operation was Baki Billa, a firefighter of Bashundhara City firefighting department, who fell when climbing down a rope from a helicopter to the roof of the building. Three other firefighters made the transition safely. At this same time, the chief security officer was safely rescued by the Bangladesh Air Force helicopter, a Bell 212.

Ellison is also suing writers' union the Writers Guild of America, west (WGA), of which he is a member, for failing to diligently pursue Ellison's royalties from Paramount.\nIn a strongly and colorfully worded press release, Ellison and his lawyer alleged that Paramount had failed to pay the author, who wrote the 1967 television episode under the pseudonym \"Cordwainer Bird\", royalties on derivative works such as tie-in novels based on the story as well as merchandise based on the episode such as a 2004 talking Christmas ornament which recited lines from the episode.\nThe suit comes two months before the release of a film, titled simply \"Star Trek\", which will re-launch the longstanding multimedia science-fiction franchise. The film will be the first original, official \"Star Trek\" video material since the series \"Star Trek: Enterprise\" was canceled in mid-2005. CBS Paramount is also gearing up for the April release of the first series of \"Star Trek\", including \"City on the Edge of Forever\", on Blu-Ray high-definition disc.\nEllison, however, states: \"And please make sure to remember, at the moment some Studio mouthpiece calls me a mooch, and says I\u2019m only pursuing this legal retribution to get into their \u2018deep pockets,\u2019 tell\u2019m Ellison snarled back, \u2018F- - - -in\u2019-A damn skippy!\u2019 I\u2019m no hypocrite.

I\u2019m doing it for the 35-year-long disrespect and the money!\"\nThe suit is not the first time contention has arisen between Ellison and \"Star Trek\" since he wrote the episode. In 1995 the author, in the book \"Harlan Ellison's The City on the Edge of Forever\", accused \"Star Trek\" creator Gene Roddenberry of \"demented lies\" about the episode. He also stated at the time: \"I've never seen more than a pittance from 'The City on the Edge of Forever,' while every thug and studio putz and semiliterate bandwagon-jumper and merchandiser has grown fat as a maggot in a corpse off what \"I\" created.\" \nRoddenberry, who died in 1991, stated in numerous interviews that Ellison's original script was unsuitable for reasons of content and budget, and rewrote it heavily; a dissatisfied Ellison chose to have a pseudonym appear on the final version. The episode as aired won the 1968 Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation, while Ellison's original script won a Writers Guild of America Award for Best Dramatic Hour-Long Script.\nEllison's suit against the WGA West, meanwhile, is for the symbolic amount of one dollar. He asserts he is seeking \"a judicial determination as to whether the WGA is doing what its stated purpose has been since day-one! To fight and negotiate for him and other writers. To obtain misappropriated, withheld, hidden earnings, no matter how minuscule or difficult to retrieve \u2013 but HIS, nonetheless.\" Ellison took part in picketing during the 2007\u20132008 Writers Guild of America strike. \nRequests for comment from CBS-Paramount and the WGA were not returned.\nHarlan Ellison became established in the science fiction community in the 1950s and won awards and acclaim for short work such as the 1969 novella \"A Boy and his Dog\" and the 1967 short story \"I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream\". He has also been the plaintiff in several high-profile lawsuits, suing a person who posted some of his copyrighted work on Usenet along with the ISPs hosting the work in 2000 and in 2006 suing Fantagraphics for defamation; Ellison won the first lawsuit and settled the second. Also in 2006, he controversially groped the breast of fellow author Connie Willis at the 64th World Science Fiction Convention in Los Angeles during the presentation of Willis's Hugo Award; Ellison later apologized for the incident."}

The Inter-American Development Bank reported that for the first time since they began tracking remittances in 2000, remittances to Latin America declined in the fourth quarter of 2008, dropping 2% relative to the fourth quarter of 2007. In January, remittances declined further, with Colombia experiencing a 16% drop relative to 2008, Brazil suffering a 14% decline, Mexico 12%, and Guatemala and El Salvador each falling 8%. These numbers come as 2008 saw an average 10% increase in remittances. Nearly US$70 billion was sent back to families in those areas in 2008.\nLow-skilled jobs such as construction, manufacturing, and restaurant and hotel work have been especially negatively impacted by the global economic crisis, putting the squeeze on migrant workers who depend on these industries. The fall in remittances could have long term effects in the workers' home countries: In times of scarcity, spending on health care and education -- investments that alleviate poverty -- gives way in favor of the bare necessities of survival.\nRemittances are number one source of foreign income for Guatemala. At $4.3 billion in 2008, they account for more than the combined income from exports of coffee, sugar and other goods. According to the Central American Institute of Social and Development Studies, 3.5 million people in Guatemala depend on remittances from 1.35 million Guatemalan citizens living in the United States.\nThe decline in remittances also has serious consequences for Guyana, which receives 43 percent of its GDP in remittances, the most of any country in Latin America and the Caribbean. Guyanese Finance Minister Ashni Singh has projected a decline of 20.9 per cent in remittances for 2009."}

Admiral Ramaroson joined other military leaders in saying they would back opposition leader, former Antananarivo mayor and former DJ Andry Rajoelina.\nMr Ravalomanana attempted to hand power over to the heads of the military, given the tasks of discussing and drafting constitutional changes, rather than transfer power to Mr Rajoelina. After the resignation was announced to the opposition, four Army generals and a head of the church were detained for reasons unknown. The true extent of the Army's loyalty to Mr Rajoelina is unclear, as reportedly the military refused to arrest President Ravalomanana despite orders from Mr Rajoelina.\nMr Rajoelina installed himself in the Presidential Palace in upper Antananarivo, which troops had seized yesterday. A cabinet loyal to him has been in operation since the end of January, when Mr Rajoelina proclaimed Mr Ravalomanana's rule to be illegitimate. The Madagascan opposition accuses Mr Ravalomanana of mismanaging the country while restricting personal freedoms.\nPresident Ravalomanana was reportedly first announced via an text message from one of his aides before being confirmed by Ravalomanana's office in a radio broadcast, in which the President proclaimed, \"After deep reflection, I have decided to dissolve the government and give up power so that a military directorate can be established\". Madagascan Army Chief of Staff Colonel Andre Ndriarijaona has declared his support for Rajoelina and says that \"99% of the forces are behind\" the opposition leader.\nThe African Union, meanwhile, reiterated its position that a military takeover in Madagascar would be considered a coup d'etat, which could result in \"firm measures\" such as Madagascar's suspension from the organization or a blocking of international aid, and urged the military to obey the country's constitution, which bars Mr Rajoelina from the presidency due to his age, and not hand power over to the former mayor, instead suggesting that power could be given to Madagascan Prime Minister General Charles Rabemananjara. Members of the Madagascan opposition say they plan to re-write the constitution and electoral code before holding new elections within two years.\nWhile reports are that the country has been overall stable during the coup, the unrest of the past two months has deprived the country of tourist revenue. Tourism, especially eco-tourism highlighting the country's rainforests and unique mammal species, brings $800 million annually to the Madagascan economy."}

They are not listening or responding appropriately to the needs\nof those they have responsibilities to. As an Independent I'd like to ensure that they start listening and take action.\nWhat would the three main policies you are taking into this election be?\nHealth: We desperately need an upgrade of Ipswich Hospital and a new hospital built in the electorate. People are literally dying waiting to see staff at Ipswich Hospital and no one is doing anything about it. Moreover, the hospital is too far away. If you have a heart attack in the Bundamba electorate, your chances of survival are significantly decreased due to how long it takes to get to Ipswich Hospital by ambulance.\nEducation: It is highly imprudent to close down small schools. In this electorate, in particular, many of the students are Special Needs students or have serious behavioural problems. To throw these students into a large school, as this government plans on doing, is reckless to say the least. I am for keeping all schools open and building new schools; reducing class sizes and increasing teacher numbers.\nTransport: It takes two hours to catch a bus from one suburb to another. Many suburbs in the electorate are landlocked. We urgently need to attend to public transport (both bus and rail services) in this electorate.\nHow would you address these policies?\nTake immediate action. Only back the government in relation to their \"wish list\" if they give us what we want in our electorate.We are tired of being ignored out here. People are literally, and I mean literally, starving in Bundamba.\nWho would you like to see get into government?\nMe.\nIn relation to \"get in\" (which party) - whoever is going to start listening, really listening and take action to address some extremely serious problems in the Bundamba electorate."}

According to Mark Bromley of the Council for Global Equality, \"the administration's leadership on this issue will be a powerful rebuke of an earlier Bush administration position that sought to deny the universal application of human rights protections to lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender individuals\".\n57 UN member nations, however, including many but not all members of the Organization of the Islamic Conference, have signed a counter-declaration introduced by Syria saying that normalization of LGBT rights would lead to \"the social normalization, and possibly the legitimization, of many deplorable acts including pedophilia.\" Vatican City also opposes the resolution but on its introduction made a statement condemning legal discrimination against LGBT persons.\nHomosexuality or homosexual behavior is illegal in some 70 UN member nations and punishable by death in seven.\nThe United States' adoption of the document comes as the Obama administration faces continued criticism from gay rights advocates on the subject of homosexual individuals serving in the United States military. While Obama has stated he would repeal Bill Clinton's 1993 \"don't ask, don't tell\" compromise and end restrictions on gays, bisexuals and lesbians serving in the military, US Defense Secretary Robert Gates says that he has had \"one brief conversation with the president\" on the subject; meanwhile, a US House bill to end the ban is losing its primary sponsor, Ellen Tauscher, to the State Department and no complementary piece of legislation has been introduced to the Senate.\nFrance's proposal of the document is one of several instances in the course of the Sarkozy administration where France and the Vatican have been at odds on issues of sexuality. France's foreign ministry, in response to comments by Pope Benedict rejecting the distribution of condoms in Africa to prevent AIDS, led EU member nations in rejecting the Pope's position. In September 2008, France openly affronted the Vatican by appointing an openly gay man, Denis Tillinac, as its ambassador to the Holy See; the Vatican rejected the appointment."}

Foley's attorney said he plans to appeal the decision. Prosecutors did not seek the death penalty.\nFoley previously said he \"loathed Dr. Yelenic\" and asked another fellow trooper to help kill him. During his testimony, which lasted several hours, Foley claimed he was joking and had no true intention of carrying out the threat, but the Indiana County jury rejected that defense after about six hours of deliberations. \nJohn Yelenic was found dead in his home on April 13, 2006, one day before he was planning on signing his divorce papers. Charges were brought against Foley in September 2007, more than 17 months after the murder.\nFoley, who had been on suspension from the Pennsylvania State Police, was himself the final witness to take the stand Wednesday in the trial. Foley insisted he was innocent during his testimony, and even made jokes that the jury laughed at on a few occasions.\n\"I never made a threat with the intention of carrying it out,\" Foley said under cross-examination by the prosecution.\nWhen Senior Deputy Attorney General Anthony Krastek pressed Foley for what was funny about asking another state trooper to help him kill Yelenic, Foley answered, \"There isn't any joke. It's just my personality, my behavior (with co-workers).\"\nProsecutors said Foley killed Yelenic after going to the dentist's house to confront him over the terms of the divorce. Prosecutors claim Foley slashed Yelenic several times with a knife and pushed his head through a small window. Yelenic bled to death.\n\"John has his justice tonight,\" Mary Ann Clark, a cousin of Yelenic, told MSNBC. \"John deserved this; he was the most wonderful person in the world. He died the most horrible death and tonight, this is his night. The system worked.\"\nFoley had been living with Michele Yelenic for two years at the time of the homicide. Prosecutors previously said Foley and Michele helped perpetuate rumors that Dr. Yelenic molested their son. John and Michele Yelenic had been separated in 2002. Michele Yelenic stood to collect Dr. Yelenic's estate and a US$1 million life insurance policy, and could lose about $2,500 a month in support if the divorce was finalized, a Pennsylvania grand jury previously determined.\nMichele Yelenic, who has not appeared at the trial, may face legal action herself, media reports indicated.

The tax would apply to firms that have been given at least $5 billion in aid from the government.\nThe move comes after recent outrage at American International Group (AIG), which gave out $165 million in bonuses to its top executives after receiving no more than $180 billion in government bailouts. AIG has said that the bonuses had to be given out, as the company was legally required by contract to do so. \nNancy Pelosi, the Speaker of the House, said that the bill was necessary because of the bad judgment shown by firms who received bailouts from the government. \n\"We must stabilize the financial system in order to strengthen our economy and create jobs. We must also protect the American taxpayer from executives who would use their companies' second chances as opportunities for private gain. Because they could not use sound judgment in the use of taxpayer funds, these AIG executives will pay the Treasury in the form of this tax,\" said Pelosi to reporters following the House vote.\nThe Senate is expected to vote upon a similar version of the bill.

This has prompted new allegations of war crimes and a review and investigation into the rules of engagement within the Israel Defense Forces (IDF).\nThere are two accounts in which fears of war crimes have been raised. In one, an Israeli commander ordered the killing of an old woman walking down a road and coming within 100 metres of an IDF position. There was no warning that a perimeter existed, no attempt was made at a warning and no attempt was made to ascertain as to whether the old woman posed a threat.\nIn a second account a woman and her two children were killed by a sniper when she was ordered to leave a building being occupied by Israeli soldiers. The commander of the unit commandeering the building however failed to inform a sniper placed on a roof top and the three were killed according to standing instructions issued to the sniper.\nIn addition to specific cases, the veterans spoke of a general contempt towards the Palestinians, and disregard for their lives. One squad leader speaking at the military academy said that the attitude of those both above and below was that\"...we should kill everyone there [in...Gaza]. Everyone there is a terrorist.\" With his immediate commanding officer advocating the clearing of buildings by shooting all within without warning.\nAn Israeli spokes person speaking to the BBC said that the incidents spoken of were well known within the brigade responsible and that any actions that took place were within its rules of engagement, however in response to the accusations the Military Advocate General of the IDF, Brigadier General Avichai Mendelblit has instructed the Israeli Military Police Investigation unit to investigate the allegations. \nTalking to Israel Radio Israeli Minister of Defense Ehud Barak said that the IDF is \"...the most moral army in the world\" though individual exceptions may have occurred, and that these would be investigated.\nOthers in Israel whilst not denying that these incidents might have occurred speak of lack a context in which they have been reported.\nInternationally the accusations are not seen as individual soldiers being responsible for war crimes but that war crimes may have been committed by the Israeli military as a whole, that its rules of engagement were drafted and implemented in such a way that they failed to sufficiently distinguish between combatants and civilians.\nIn response to the allegations Richard Falk, the UN special rapporteur for human rights in the Palestinian territories, said that the Geneva Conventions required that there had to be a clear distinction between military targets and the civilian population and that \"...If it is not possible to do so, then launching the attacks is inherently unlawful and would seem to constitute a war crime of the greatest magnitude under international law...\" \nIf it is to have indeed failed to protect the lives of Palestinian civilians then the Israeli military not only violated international law but its own moral code of conduct as outlined in its tenet of purity of arms."}

The database could also have the potential to inform authorities at correctional facilities if an inmate was being visited by a gang member. The Saskatchewan government plans to hire analysts to study gang member networking.\nThe ministers also discussed the existing legislation that was in place regulating how police obtain authority to place wiretaps on phone lines. \"We want the police to have the right to wiretap people immediately and get authorization from judges immediately after the commission of the crime,\" said British Columbia Attorney General Wally Oppal.\nAnother priority was to change the Criminal Code law with regard to bail laws. Redford says that, \"Once the person has demonstrated one time that they're not prepared to respect a court order, the second time they go in for breaching those conditions, there shouldn't be an assumption that they're going to respect the court order the second time and there should be a reverse onus and the presumption should be that they will be held without bail.\" \nThe idea of a separate gang facility to hold accused gang members was abandoned. \"We'd be looking at targeting the hardened adult gang members, the leaders of the gangs who have been in and out of prison for a number of years and who can use a remand centre to go recruit. They could in fact use that as a business networking opportunity \"per se\", which is something we don't want to encourage.\" said Darryl Hickie, Saskatchewan's minister of corrections, public safety and policing.

{"id": "123465", "revid": "39076", "url": "https://en.wikinews.org/wiki?curid=123465", "title": "Utah legalizes homebrewing", "text": "The United States state of Utah has legalized homebrewing of beer and wine.\nH.B. 51, \"Exemption for Alcoholic Beverage Manufacturing License\", was signed into law by Utah governor Jon M. Huntsman, Jr. on March 24 after being passed by large majorities in both houses of the State Legislature. The bill was introduced by Salt Lake City representative Christine A. Johnson (D-25th district) and will take effect on May 12. \nThe act modifies existing Utah law to give an exemption to the state's requirement of a brewing license for amateur brewers, as long as the beer or wine they produce is not for sale and the amount produced is less than 100 US gallons (379 liters) per year for an individual or 200 US gallons (757 liters) for a couple. The unlicensed distillation of spirits remains illegal in the United States under federal law.\nAlthough prohibition of alcohol in the United States ended in 1933 and the homebrewing of beer has been legal at a federal level since 1978, many US states, counties and cities restrict the production, sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages more tightly than is done at the federal level. With the passage of Utah's legislation, four US states still forbid homebrewing: Kentucky, Alabama, Mississippi and Oklahoma.\nThe legislation was introduced largely through the work of University of Utah law student Douglas Wawrzynski. AHA director Gary Glass was also closely involved with Rep Johnson in drafting the bill's language. Wawrzynski told \"Wikinews\" about what led him to initiate a campaign to change the law:\n\"I moved to Utah from Connecticut in 2005 and started into the hobby \"[of homebrewing]\" shortly thereafter. There are multiple homebrew shops that have been operating legally in Utah for several years, so it wasn't until after I started law school in the fall of 2007 that someone suggested to me that the hobby might not be legal in Utah. After having done some research and contacting the American Homebrewers Association, I began to understand the current ambiguity of the law and how it could certainly be interpreted to adversely affect homebrewers. In fact in 2005 the city of South Salt Lake had taken steps to affirmatively enact penalties for engaging in homebrewing. While that effort was ultimately abandoned it illustrated just how the current state of the law could have a negative impact on homebrewers.\"\nDespite the restrictions, according to the American Homebrewers Association (AHA), some seven thousand people in Utah were illegally taking part in the hobby, which has 750,000 adherents nationwide. Rep Johnson said \"home-brewing is a healthy and vibrant hobby in Utah\" and thanked the AHA for \"thorough education, great committee testimony and association members who flooded elected officials with emails of support.\"\nThe bill passes on Rep Johnson's second attempt to introduce it. As H.B. 425, the act was introduced late in the Utah legislature's 2008 session, where it did not reach a Utah Senate vote. Ms Johnson's legislative work has primarily concerned equality and human rights in Utah, including a successful attempt to add a voluntary amount to the marriage license fee in order to fund shelters for victims of domestic violence and a failed attempt to introduce language banning discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity into Utah state law.\nOpposition to the bill, meanwhile, was sporadic and reflected, in Wawrzynski's view, bad understanding of homebrewing rather than hostility toward the hobby:\n\"In each of the several committee meetings this bill went through, the bill was met with challenging and sometimes bizarre questions regarding its impact and what this would enable people to do. One Senator, Senator Lilenquist \"[State Sen. Dan Liljenquist, R-23rd district]\" even inquired if this bill would make it legal for someone to put beer in a baby bottle and give it to a one year old.\"\nRonda Rudd Menlove, a Republican representing the 1st district, says her primary concern in voting against the bill was the potential for alcohol to affect children:\n\"When the vote was taken on HB 51, I had a constituent sitting by me, a young high school student. I briefly explained the bill to him during the debate and then asked him how he would vote on the bill and why. This is what he told me. He said that he was concerned that young people would have greater access to alcohol because alcohol would be brewed in homes resulting in great accessibility for youth living in those homes. This concerned him greatly as a member of a local youth city council as well. He is concerned about the amount of under-age drinking in his community and believed that greater access to alcohol could cause an increase in under-age drinking in Utah...\"\n\"My secondary reason for voting against the bill is that I am adamantly opposed to the excess use and abuse of alcohol. I am opposed to any use of alcohol by pregnant mothers. As a secondary level teacher and high school administrator, I worked with troubled youth and special education populations. I have struggled with young people who live with the effects of Fetal Alcohol Syndrome. If you want to be very depressed, read about the lifelong effects of FAS. This syndrome affects learning and behavior that is often erratic and unpredictable. Most of the students with FAS fail miserably in school and find little success in school, jobs, or life. This is a very serious problem related to alcohol use and one that affects the innocent fetus and not the perpetrator of this action.\"\n\"Utah has quirky alcohol laws. The overarching goal of preventing under-age drinking and the abuse of alcohol has created these laws. The intention is admirable and one that I support. How to achieve these goals is challenging and has resulted in laws that may seem strange to others living outside of Utah. Utah's Governor and Legislature has struggled with this and recently passed legislation revamping these laws. I voted against those changes due to the fact that little information was provided about the impact of the changes.\"\nKraig Powell (54th district), a Duchesne County Republican, the other representative to vote against the bill in its final form, said he did so because a constituent was \"concerned about increased access to alcohol and drunk driving dangers\". Meanwhile, Senate Majority Assistant Whip Gregory Bell (R-22nd district), said to the \"Deseret News\": \"I'm not comfortable with home brewing. It seems fraught with mischief to me.\"\nWawrzynski believes that education and understanding from the community were critical in the passage of the bill.\n\"[T]hrough the efforts, emails and testimony of people like Representative Johnson and Gary Glass, and most importantly, from Utah homebrewers themselves, we changed minds through education. In fact, the Chairman of the Senate Business and Labor Committee, Senator Valentine \"(R-14th district)\" openly admitted on the record that he had been compelled to change his vote to a favorable one after hearing compelling testimony from member of the Utah community.\"\n\"I think that as the state of Utah continues to grow in diversity, the community will become enriched with a wide array of backgrounds and opinions. As this happens we will have an opportunity to develop a greater understanding of our own neighbors and how differences in lifestyle can ultimately be respected and embraced.\"\nParalleling a common motto of the homebrewing community, Wawrzynski proclaimed on passage of the bill: \"Utah homebrewers are finally free to relax, stop worrying, and have a legal homebrew\"."}

According to the Arts and Humanities Citation Index Professor Chomsky is the eighth most cited scholar of all time. \nOn March 13, Professor Chomsky sat down with Michael Dranove for an interview in his MIT office in Cambridge, Massachusetts.\nI just wanted to know if you had any thoughts on recent NATO actions and the protests coming up at the 60th NATO conference, I know you\u2019re speaking at the counter-conference.\nCould be I give so many talks I can\u2019t remember \"(laughs).\" \nOn the NATO conference, well I mean the obvious question is why should NATO exist? In fact you can ask questions about why it should ever have existed, but now why should it exist. I mean the theory was, whether you believe it or not, that it would be a defensive alliance against potential Soviet aggression, that\u2019s the basic doctrine. Well there\u2019s no defense against Soviet aggression, so whether you believe that doctrine or not that\u2019s gone.\nWhen the Soviet Union collapsed there had been an agreement, a recent agreement, between Gorbachev and the U.S government and the first Bush administration. The agreement was that Gorbachev agreed to a quite remarkable concession: he agreed to let a united Germany join the NATO military alliance. Now it is remarkable in the light of history, the history of the past century, Germany alone had virtually destroyed Russia, twice, and Germany backed by a hostile military alliance, centered in the most phenomenal military power in history, that\u2019s a real threat. Nevertheless he agreed, but there was a quid pro quo, namely that NATO should not expand to the east, so Russia would at least have a kind of security zone. And George Bush and James Baker, secretary of state, agreed that NATO would not expand one inch to the east. Gorbachev also proposed a nuclear free weapons zone in the region, but the U.S wouldn\u2019t consider that.\nOkay, so that was the basis on which then shortly after the Soviet Union collapsed. Well, Clinton came into office what did he do? Well one of the first things he did was to back down on the promise of not expanding NATO to the east. Well that\u2019s a significant threat to the Soviet Union, to Russia now that there was no longer any Soviet Union, it was a significant threat to Russia and not surprisingly they responded by beefing up their offensive capacity, not much but some. So they rescinded their pledge not to use nuclear weapons on first strike, NATO had never rescinded it, but they had and started some remilitarization. With Bush, the aggressive militarism of the Bush administration, as predicted, induced Russia to extend further its offensive military capacity; it\u2019s still going on right now. When Bush proposed the missile defense systems in Eastern Europe, Poland and Czechoslovakia, it was a real provocation to the Soviet Union. I mean that was discussed in U.S arms control journals, that they would have to regard as a potential threat to their strategic deterrent, meaning as a first strike weapon. And the claim was that it had to do with Iranian missiles, but forget about that. \nTake say on Obama, Obama\u2019s national security advisor James Jones former Marine commandant is on record of favoring expansion of NATO to the south and the east, further expansion of NATO, and also making it an intervention force. And the head of NATO, Hoop Scheffer, he has explained that NATO must take on responsibility for ensuring the security of pipelines and sea lanes, that is NATO must be a guarantor of energy supplies for the West. Well that\u2019s kind of an unending war, so do we want NATO to exist, do we want there to be a Western military alliance that carries out these activities, with no pretense of defense? Well I think that\u2019s a pretty good question; I don\u2019t see why it should, I mean there happens to be no other military alliance remotely comparable \u2014 if there happened to be one I\u2019d be opposed to that too. So I think the first question is, what is this all about, why should we even be debating NATO, is there any reason why it should exist?\nWe\u2019ve seen mass strikes all around the world, in countries that we wouldn\u2019t expect it. Do think this is a revival of the Left in the West? Or do you think it\u2019s nothing?\nIt\u2019s really hard to tell. I mean there\u2019s certainly signs of it, and in the United States too, in fact we had a sit down strike in the United States not long ago, which is a very militant labor action. Sit down strikes which began at a significant level in the 1930\u2019s were very threatening to management and ownership, because the sit down strike is one step before workers taking over the factory and running it and kicking out the management, and probably doing a better job. So that\u2019s a frightening idea, and police were called in and so on. Well we just had one in the United States at the Republic Windows and Doors Factory, it\u2019s hard to know, I mean these things are just hard to predict, they may take off, and they may take on a broader scope, they may fizzle away or be diverted. \nObama has said he\u2019s going to halve the budget. Do you think it\u2019s a little reminiscent of Clinton right before he decided to institute welfare reform, basically destroying half of welfare, do you think Obama is going to take the same course?\nThere\u2019s nothing much in his budget to suggest otherwise, I mean for example, he didn\u2019t really say much about it, about the welfare system, but he did indicate that they are going to have to reconsider Social Security. Well there\u2019s nothing much about social security that needs reconsideration, it\u2019s in pretty good financial shape, probably as good as it's been in its history, it's pretty well guaranteed for decades in advance. As long as any of the famous baby boomers are around social Security will be completely adequate. So its not for them, contrary to what\u2019s being said. If there is a long term problem, which there probably is, there are minor adjustments that could take care of things. \nSo why bring up Social Security at all? If it\u2019s an issue at all it\u2019s a very minor one. I suspect the reason for bringing it up is, Social Security is regarded as a real threat by power centers, not because of what it does, very efficient low administrative costs, but for two reasons. One reason is that it helps the wrong people. It helps mostly poor people and disabled people and so on, so that\u2019s kind of already wrong, even though it has a regressive tax. But I think a deeper reason is that social security is based on an idea that power centers find extremely disturbing, namely solidarity, concern for others, community, and so on.\nThe fundamental idea of Social Security is that we care about whether the disabled widow across town has food to eat. And that kind of idea has to be driven out of people\u2019s heads. If people have a commitment to solidarity, mutual aid, support, and so on, that\u2019s dangerous because that could lead to concern for other things. Like, it\u2019s well known, for example, that markets just don\u2019t provide lots of options, which today are crucial options. So for example, markets today permit you to buy one brand of car or another. But a market doesn\u2019t permit you to decide \"I don\u2019t want a car, I want a public transportation system\". That\u2019s just not a choice made available on the market. And the same is true on a wide range of other issues of social significance, like whether to help the disabled widow across town. Okay, that\u2019s what communities decide, that\u2019s what democracy is about, that\u2019s what social solidarity is about and mutual aid, and building institutions by people for the benefit of people. And that threatens the system of domination and control right at the heart, so there\u2019s a constant attack on Social Security even though the pretexts aren\u2019t worth paying attention to.\nThere are other questions on the budget; the budget is called redistributive, I mean, very marginally it is so, but the way it is redistributive to the extent that it is, is by slightly increasing the tax responsibility to the extremely wealthy. Top couple of percent, and the increase is very marginal, doesn\u2019t get anywhere near where it was during the periods of high growth rate and so on. So that\u2019s slightly redistributive, but there are other ways to be redistributive, which are more effective, for example allowing workers to unionize. It\u2019s well known that where workers are allowed to unionize and most of them want to, that does lead to wages, better working conditions, benefits and so on, which is redistributive and also helps turn working people into more of a political force. And instead of being atomized and separated they\u2019re working to together in principle, not that humans function so wonderfully, but at least it\u2019s a move in that direction. And there is a potential legislation on the table that would help unionize, the Employee Free Choice Act. Which Obama has said he\u2019s in favor of, but there\u2019s nothing about it in the budget, in fact there\u2019s nothing in the budget at all as far as I can tell about improving opportunities to unionize, which is an effective redistributive goal. \nAnd there\u2019s a debate right now, it happens to be in this morning's paper if Obama\u2019s being accused by Democrats, in fact particularly by Democrats, of taking on too much. Well actually he hasn\u2019t taken on very much, the stimulus package; I mean anybody would have tried to work that out with a little variation. And the same with the bailouts which you can like or not, but any President is going to do it. What is claimed is that he\u2019s adding on to it health care reform, which will be very expensive, another hundreds of billions of dollars, and it\u2019s just not the time to do that. I mean, why would health care reform be more expensive? Well it depends which options you pick. If the healthcare reforms maintain the privatized system, yeah, it\u2019s going to be very expensive because it's a hopelessly inefficient system, it's very costly, its administrative costs are far greater than Medicare, the government run system. So what that means is that he\u2019s going to maintain a system which we know is inefficient, has poor outcomes, but is a great benefit to insurance companies, financial institutions, the pharmaceutical industry and so on. So it can save money, health care reform can be a method of deficit reduction. Namely by moving to an efficient system that provides health care to everyone, but that\u2019s hardly talked about, its advocates are on the margins and its main advocates aren\u2019t even included in the groups that are discussing it. \nAnd if you look through it case after case there are a lot of questions like that. I mean, take unionization again, this isn\u2019t in the budget but take an example. Obama, a couple of weeks ago, wanted to make a gesture to show his solidarity with the labor movement, which workers, well that\u2019s different \"(chuckles)\" with the workers not the labor movement. And he went to go visit an industrial plant in Illinois, the plant was owned by Caterpillar. There was some protest over that, by human rights groups, church groups, and others because of Caterpillar\u2019s really brutal role in destroying what\u2019s left of Palestine. These were real weapons of mass destruction, so there were protests but he went anyway. However, there was a much deeper issue which hasn\u2019t even been raised, which is a comment on our deep ideological indoctrination. I mean Caterpillar was the first industrial organization to resort to scabs, strikebreakers, to break a major strike. This was in the 1980\u2019s, Reagan had already opened the doors with the air controllers, but this is the first in the manufacturing industry to do it. That hadn\u2019t been done in generations. In fact, it was illegal in every industrial country except apartheid South Africa. But that was Caterpillar\u2019s achievement helping to destroy a union by calling in scabs, and if you call in scabs forget about strikes, in other words, or any other labor action. Well that\u2019s the plant Obama went to visit. It\u2019s possible he didn\u2019t know, because the level of indoctrination in our society is so profound that most people wouldn\u2019t even know that. Still I think that it\u2019s instructive, if you\u2019re interested in doing something redistributive, you don\u2019t go to a plant that made labor history by breaking the principle that you can\u2019t break strikes with scabs. \nI live out in Georgia, and a lot of people there are ultra-right wing Ron Paul Libertarians. They\u2019re extremely cynical. Is there any way for people on the left to reach out to them?\nI think what you have to do is ask, what makes them Ron Paul Libertarians? I don\u2019t happen to think that makes a lot of sense, but nevertheless underlying it are feelings that do make sense. I mean the feeling for example that the government is our enemy. It\u2019s a very widespread feeling, in fact, that\u2019s been induced by propaganda as well. \nSo pretty soon it will be April 15th, and the people in your neighborhood are going to have to send in their income taxes. The way they\u2019re going to look at it, and the way they\u2019ve been trained to look at it is that there is some alien force, like maybe from Mars, that is stealing our hard earned money from us and giving it to the government. Okay, well, that would be true in a totalitarian state, but if you had a democratic society you\u2019d look at it the other way around You\u2019d say \"great, it's April 15th, we\u2019re all going to contribute to implement the plans that we jointly decided on for the benefit of all of us.\" But that idea is even more frightening than Social Security. It means that we would have a functioning democracy, and no center of concentrated power is ever going to want that, for perfectly obvious reasons. So yes there are efforts, and pretty successful efforts to get people to fear the government as their enemy, not to regard it as the collective population acting in terms of common goals that we\u2019ve decided on which would be what have to happen in a democracy. And is to an extent what does happen in functioning democracies, like Bolivia, the poorest country in South America. It\u2019s kind of what\u2019s happening there more or less. But that\u2019s very remote from what\u2019s happening here. \nWell I think Ron Paul supporters can be appealed to on these grounds, they're also against military intervention, and we can ask \"okay, why?\" Is it just for their own security, do they want to be richer or something? I doubt it, I think people are concerned because they think we destroyed Iraq and so on. So I think that there are lots of common grounds that can be explored, even if the outcomes, at the moment, look very different. They look different because they\u2019re framed within fixed doctrines. But those doctrines are not graven in stone. They can be undermined."}

In a time where prices are higher, 'recession gardens' are becoming increasingly popular, echoing the victory gardens which were planted during World War I and World War II which helped to reduce the stress and pressure of food shortages.\n\"There is more interest in vegetable gardens similar to the victory gardens. Because of the economy, they are being called recession gardens,\" said a master gardener who volunteers at Ohio State University's Extension Service office, Fred Hanacek.\nThe new fad recently caught on in Iowa where families have began to plant the recession gardens to save money in the produce sections of supermarkets, especially organic fruits and vegetables. Public News Service quotes the National Gardening Association (NGA) as saying that they expect a nearly 20% increase in personal home garden across the U.S.. Some of the increase is also due to people wanting to know what goes onto their vegetables and in their foods.\n\"I do believe you'll find there's an extra expense in actually producing your own food, but the food quality you get is far better than what you can purchase in a store,\" said Beverly Bernhard a veteran gardener from Iowa.\nThe new trend has also gotten the attention of U.S. president Barack Obama who recently stated that he plans to plant a vegetable garden at the White House. It will be the first vegetable garden to be planted at the White House in over 20 years. The last time a garden of this kind was planted at the White House was in World War II when Eleanor Roosevelt planted her Victory Garden. In 1800, former U.S. president John Adams is reported to have planted the first White House garden. Andrew Jackson went a bit further, building a greenhouse.\nMichelle Obama, the First Lady of the United States, broke ground on the new garden with the fifth grade class at Bancroft Elementary located in Washington, D.C. on March 20. The garden, which will be 1,100 square feet and an 'L' shape, will be located on the White House's South Lawn and the Obamas plan to grow over 55 varieties of vegetables.\n\"Let\u2019s hear it for vegetables. Let\u2019s hear it for fruits,\" yelled Mrs. Obama as they broke ground on the garden. \"I\u2019ve been able to have my kids eat so many different things that they would have never touched if we had bought them at a store,\" she added. Mrs. Obama also said that it will be the entire family's responsibility to maintain the garden, including the U.S. president.\nMany vegetables grow easily, without having to do a lot of work to maintain them. Some examples are lettuce and zucchini. The NGA says at least 9 million Americans will grow vegetable gardens for the first time ever in 2009. An estimated 43 million Americans will plant their own personal vegetable gardens this year."}

Six of the victims were killed at the scene. The others died later at a local hospital.

Pol Pot, the leader of the Khmer Rouge uprising, died in 1998 which brought a formal surrender and end to the organization.\nArrested in 1999, Duch claims to be a born-again Christian and has admitted his personal responsibility for events at Tuol Sleng, though he denies personally torturing or executing prisoners. Prisoners at the camp were routinely tortured to admit they were CIA spies, or admit to other crimes, after which they were killed.\nIt is expected that Duch will participate in the trial, addressing charges that he oversaw the torture and execution of more than 15,000 individuals, both Cambodians and foreigners.\n\"A confession is a good thing for Duch to do.

She took time to respond to questions \"Wikinews\"'s posed to her about her career in music and her other endeavors.\nThis is the fifth in a series of interviews with past Eurovision contestants, which will be published sporadically in the lead-up to mid-May's next contest in Moscow.\nIntroduction to her life in music.\n You are now 35 years old. Being in one's 30s was considered \"getting old\" a generation ago; now it is considered sexy, sophisticated and more youthful. How do you feel being able to promote this fairly new ideal of explicit beauty and sex appeal in one's 30s through your contract with L'Or\u00e9al in the Ukraine?\nRuslana: I love to work with L'Or\u00e9al because we have [so] much in common. This company really knows what true beauty is.\nNo matter how old [you are], the main thing is how you feel [about] yourself. I have [the] heart of [a] real Amazon so my wild energy will always be with me. \nMy message for young people is: let's have real energy! Let's have real independence! Without any drugs. Without any synthetic energy. You can create it, you can make it yourself. It comes directly from your heart.\n I read that your mother was one of the biggest driving forces in your decision to pursue music as a career. In what ways did she encourage you? What singers or groups were your musical inspirations growing up, and do they still inspire you today? \nRuslana: I have been singing since I was four years old. Yes, my mom was always near and helped to make my music dream come true. She's still my best friend. When I was a little kid I studied at an experimental music school and sang in a band. My parents joked that the microphone was my first toy and that I learnt the [music] notes earlier than the letters. \nI loved Queen, Deep Purple, Pink Floyd, A-ha, Beatles, Police, Cher and many others. I still love them. \n You were trained in classical piano at the Music Conservatory in Lviv. How did the skills you learned while studying there impact your musical style now?\nRuslana: When I graduated from the conservatory, I obtained two educational qualifications in the field of music as a piano player and a symphonic orchestra conductor. My music education helps me very much to create my own music. For example, [a] few years ago at Lviv's 750th anniversary, I performed \"Energy Source\" as conductor of a symphonic orchestra that played my own composed music in a beautiful light show. \n I interviewed Edsilia Rombley last month and she has a situation similar to yours, in that the main collaborator and producer of her music became her husband as well. How did you meet your husband and what led you to form a musical partnership? Also, how did the two of you fall in love?\nRuslana: Both of us were born in Lviv. We had the same friends, the same interest, objectives and the same love \u2013 music. I wanted to work with professionals and Sasha was [a] famous singer [at] that time in Lviv. He had his own band. So we met about work. From the first second I understood that we have [a] kindred spirit. Music connects us. And with our first song appeared our first feelings...\n When you first started receiving recognition and becoming successful in the Ukraine in the mid-1990s, was it overwhelming? What was your main motivation in your career during this time? Was there ever a time where you considered leaving the music industry to live a quieter life?\nRuslana: No, I was born for music. I love what I'm doing with all of my heart. The first thing [about] recognition [is that] I should be very truthful with myself and with people. It's very important. I'm always honest with my fans. If you work only for money and you sing a song that you must sing but you don't feel it all of your heart and soul \u2013 you will be [a] singer for [only] one day.\n\"Wild Dances\".\n\"' In more than one project, including your \"Wild Dances\" CD, you have worked extensively in the unique musical tradition of the Hutsul people. What caused you to pursue such a niche? Also, are there any important things about the Hutsul people and tradition that people may not know, that you wish you could bring awareness to?\nRuslana: My father is from the West Ukrainian area [populated by] the Hutsuls, the dwellers of the Ukrainian Carpathian Mountains. So I was born in it. I saw it all in my childhood. Hutsuls have a unique culture with an ancient and rich history which inspired me to create my concept album \"Wild Dances\". It combines powerful and permeating ethnic drums, trumpet sounds of the trembita, an ancient Hutsul music instrument, with modern dance beats.\n You were chosen by the National Television Company of Ukraine to represent them at Eurovision in 2004. How were you approached by them? Was it a hard decision for you to decide whether or not to accept their offer? Obviously it was very successful for you, but before the fact, did you ever consider not performing?\nRuslana: I can say that before I went to Eurovision there were a lot of talks \u2013 [people saying it's] good or bad. I just did not listen to anyone; [I] just trusted my instincts.\n Your performance is one of the best-remembered in history. Did it ever tire you to hear yourself compared to \"Xena\" from the television show \"Xena: Warrior Princess\"? Are you okay with that being your primary aesthetic attribute to foreign audiences?\nRuslana: For me [a] real Amazon is not [a] \"Warrior Princess.\" It's [a] beautiful, smart, independent woman. She knows what she definitely wants and she gets it. Lana [\"Editor's note: Ruslana's alter-ego, an \"Amazon,\" in her album Wild Energy\"] dreams about love. Magic feelings that give us inspiration and wings. \nThe main idea of [the] \"Wild Energy\" show is to show the character of [an] Amazon. She can be [a] girl [with] wind, girl [with] fire, girl [with] water, girl [with] rock. She's [a] girl [made of the] elements, but she fell in love and became vulnerable. She doesn't know what to do, how to live with those feelings.\n German public television held a contest a few years ago and the public voted \"Wild Dances\" the best Eurovision song in history, ahead of well-established standards like \"Waterloo\" and \"Ein bi\u00dfchen Frieden\". Do you feel your song is the best in the history of the entire Contest? \nRuslana: It was a great honor for me. I was so happy to hear it. [There were] a lot of beautiful talented singers and great songs [in all the] years [the competition has been in existence]. I like original songs with deep meaning and of course interesting shows.\n\"Wild Energy\".\n\"' The \"Wild Energy\" concept is tied to a science fiction novel. How did the idea come about that you would take the sentiment expressed in that novel and make music with it? How do you personally relate with the messages conveyed in the novel and in your music? What does \"the energy for living\" mean to you?\nRuslana: We're trying to build a new energy generation using the book \"Wild Energy - Lana\". This new project means a new album, new videos, new songs.\nMy new project \"Wild Energy\" is based on the science fiction novel by Marina and Sergey Dyachenko...They are very good friends of mine. The main idea of this novel is that in a [futuristic] city which experiences a global energy crisis, far more threatening than lack of oil and gas, people are lacking their will for life, their energy of the heart \u2013 the fuel for people. Lana, one of the synthetic inhabitants, sets out to find the mystical energy source. After many adventures she discovers that the wild energy comes from her own heart.\n How did you cross paths with T-Pain and Missy Elliott, and how did your musical collaboration with them come to fruition?\nRuslana: [The] \"Wild Energy\" album was recorded at the Hit Factory Studio in Miami. [The] song featuring T-Pain [is] called \"Moon of Dreams.\" \"Moon of Dreams\" is first and foremost an exotic mix of Slavic tunes and American R&amp;B grooves. It's dance but romantic, temperamental and gentle simultaneously. The song that I sing with Missy Elliott is called \"The Girl that Rules\" and is a big departure [from] ethno-infused pop and dance sounds.\nGoodwill work and politics.\n\"' One of the messages of \"Wild Energy\" is that you want to bring to a wider audience the dangers of the global climate change, and the importance to use renewable energy. Do you feel Ukraine has been \"a victim\" to other energy resources that have been more expensive or more mortally damaging, specifically with the Chernobyl disaster and Ukraine's feud with Gazprom in Russia?\nRuslana: The thing is that I started the project in the Parliament [for] renewable energy. I, as a deputy, thought that if there are so many conflicts around the gas, we need to introduce solar panels. For [the project], I [became versed in] all alternative energy [forms]. Can you imagine, me, [a] musician, [getting] into all economic and technical nuances. Me and my team tried to [promote] this project. But the parliament was so incapable [of working properly] that it was wiser [to] go out, [which] I actually did. My policy [now] \u2013 it's my new show \"Wild Energy\". That [is] how I will appeal to people.\n You have also served as a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador for the Ukraine, and your platform has been increased awareness of human trafficking. \nRuslana: I released two video clips which aim to make potential victims aware of the dangers of human trafficking, [and I] performed at an anti-human trafficking event in Vienna, Austria, organized by UN.GIFT in front of 117 international delegations. My song \"Not For Sale\" became the anthem of the anti-trafficking campaign.\nI think this is a very important issue and I will do everything I can to draw attention to it!\n You were one of the public faces of the Orange Revolution, and ended up becoming a member of Parliament for a while. What caused you to throw your support behind Viktor Yushchenko so publicly, considering it could have been dangerous not only to your career, but your life? \nRuslana: It seems that staying in the Verkhovna Rada [\"Editor's note: The Parliament of the Ukraine\"] may [be able to solve] certain problems. Unfortunately, not always. I realized that in our country, if you want to do something for your Motherland \u2013 you should do it by yourself; not hoping that one day somebody will hear or help you...\n When you left Parliament, you said, \"I still hope for real changes and for a new political generation to come with the mentality to work and not being corrupt.\" What did you mean by that? \nRuslana: All that I can say is that I'm not in policy any more. And I'm very happy because of that! It seemed to me that [passing policies] could help me make more for my country, but on the contrary, [policy] just tied my hands. I came into politics [with] \"[rose-colored] glasses\" and [left] there very disappointed...\n\"' When I was asking for research help among the Ukrainian and Russian-speaking Wikipedians, one of the Russians made an off-hand comment to me that stuck. \"\"Ukraine is just a part of Russia anyway.\"\" When I asked a Ukrainian Wikipedian what that meant to him, he said it upset him. How do you feel when you encounter such attitudes, considering you also release your music to the Russian market?\nRuslana: Ukraine is [an] absolutely independent country, with her own culture, language, [and] history. \nAfter winning on the Eurovision I [received] a lot of invitations [to] Russia. Many friends of mine live there. My grandparents live in Yekaterinburg. I had a lot of propositions to make a big tour in Russia. I like to give concerts there. We will definitely show Russia my new \"Wild Energy\" show.\nCounterpoint on the East in Eurovision.\n One final political question, and this one relates to Eurovision: I interviewed past winners Nicole and Anne Marie David, and both seemed to indicate that \"bloc voting\" could exist amongst nations; in Nicole's case, she believed it is currently occurring, especially between the countries of Eastern Europe. Your song received votes from nearly every country in Europe, but other winners weren't so fortunate, like the song from Russia last year. Do you believe \"bloc voting\" exists between the countries of Eastern Europe, and do you feel it is unfair to Western European performers who enter the Contest?\nRuslana: I think it's because Eastern Europe shows to others her graceful, beautiful style. That style wasn't typical for other countries. Eurovision every year has a lot pretty girls, handsome boys, but it's not enough. If you want to win \u2013 you must be special, not like many others. \n Finally, what would you like to say as a closing note to all your fans who have followed your career? They would probably like to know what's next for you, what projects do you have planned?\nRuslana: Most of all, thanks for all the support and love, for all the WILD ENERGY that you give me during my concerts.\nThanks for all your positive [comments] and all of your smiles. It means a lot to me...\nI hope that my greatest success will be in the near future. Now I work a lot for it. It has been more than five years since I [won] Eurovision and was named Best-Selling Ukrainian Artist at [the] World Music Awards in Las Vegas. Just about time for the showbiz electorate to demand a new program from their chosen one. I'm very happy that my new album is finished. I was waiting for it [for] so long. I hope all of my fans will like it. Because all that I do, I [do] for them.\nSource.\n __NOEDITSECTION__"}

Whereas a negotiator has said, \u201cI don't see how the UAW will do anything until they see what the bondholders will give up.\"\nThe Obama administration is looking toward bankruptcy proceedings for the automakers, \"as a mechanism to help them restructure quickly and emerge stronger. [It will] quickly clear away old debts that are weighing them down. What we are asking is difficult. It will require hard choices by companies. It will require unions and workers who have already made painful concessions to make even more. It will require creditors to recognise that they cannot hold out for the prospect of endless government bailouts.\" said Obama.\nThe auto parts suppliers and IT software exporters in India have already been affected by the declining auto sales. GM and Chrysler software contracts provide US$300 to 350 million a year to vendors in India. As well these two major automakers usually award US$1 billion contracts to auto parts suppliers. \"We are worried and closely watching the developments in the US to gauge the impact. The decline in auto sales in the US has already hit the order books of Indian suppliers,\" said a Delhi auto parts supplier. \n\"Going forward, the industry will undoubtedly be smaller, but if our efforts are successful it will be viable and it will support good jobs for Canadians,\" said Clements. \n, Congresswoman put forward the CARS act which provides a US$3,000 to 5,000 incentive for those who trade in their vehicle for a fuel-efficient car. \"It clearly stimulates the economy, and it gets the consumer into the showroom and gets them buying again.

The United Nations argues that this is equivalent to spousal rape. Spousal rape is specifically prohibited in 45 countries worldwide and may be prosecutable by existing rape statutes in others.\nThe circumstances of the bill's passage have raised questions as well, with Senator Humeira Namati saying that the bill was not read out or debated in the House of Elders, the Afghan National Assembly's upper house and Shinkai Zahine Karokhail of the House of the People stating the bill received only limited debate in the lower chamber. \"They wanted to pass it almost like a secret negotiation,\" Karokhail told the \"Guardian\". \"There were lots of things that we wanted to change, but they didn't want to discuss it because Karzai wants to please the Shia before the election.\" Namati calls the new law \"worse than the Taliban\".\nAccording to Karokhail and others, the law received Karzai's support in order to boost his popularity among Afghanistan's Shi'a population, which comprises an estimated ten per cent of the country, ahead of an upcoming election in August. A Monday ruling by the Afghan Supreme Court has allowed Karzai to remain in power in the interval between the expiration of his term on May 21 and the upcoming Afghan presidential election in August. It is unclear whether the law would apply only to Shi'a persons or to all Afghans.\nNonetheless some changes were made to the bill; the proposed minimum age of marriage for girls was raised to 16 from aged 9 and temporary marriage is not provided for. MP Shukria Barakzai says that \"before this was passed family issues were decided by customary law\" and that the new law, while not perfect, is an \"improvement\". MP Ustad Mohammad Akbari defended the bill as well, saying it protects women's rights: \"Men are stronger and women are a little bit weaker; even in the west you do not see women working as firefighters.\"\nA spokesman for Mr. Karzai gave reporters no comment."}
