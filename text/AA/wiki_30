Their statement, released early this evening, indicates a formal ballot on strike action is inevitable \u2013 unless the company revises their two percent offer for 2010.\nThe deadline set by the Communication Workers' Union (CWU) passed at noon last Friday, apparently unheeded by BT. The union's announcement of their intent to ballot members apparently resulted in the offer \u2014 one with no new money on the table for this year.\nLast week, when their ultimatum was ignored, CWU deputy secretary general (DSG) Andy Kerr expressed deep disappointment, citing the substantial profits made by the company in the last financial year: \"[w]e're obviously very disappointed that BT has not improved its pay offer of 2% despite their healthy profits this year.\"\nThe turnaround from losses of 244 million to a billion-pound-plus profit has, the union claims, galvanised their membership into seriously considering industrial action. Reports of senior directors receiving million-pound bonuses, and former minister landing over over \u00a350,000 extra per-year, are characterised as \"directors' 'snouts in the trough'\". Hewitt was suspended from her parliamentary party in March over cash-for-access accusations, and works two to three days each month on BT's remuneration committee.\nThe UK's described the now-rejected offer as being worth 2% this year, and an additional 3% in 2011 with staff bonuses of up to \u00a3250. The package supposedly contains pledges on no compulsory redundancies and the return of call centre and non-frontline work from outsource companies in India.\n\"Wikinews\" called both the Communication Workers' Union, and British Telecom, seeking clarification on a number of points. Richard Knowles, a BT press officer in London, forwarded their terse sub-400-word statement, refusing to be drawn on reports that the offer includes the repatriation of call centre and back-office jobs. When challenged on this work being carried out in a jurisdiction with less-stringent , and legislation, our reporter was referred back to the company's statement.\nSian Jones of the CWU's Press Office, commenting prior to the union's evening statement, remarked that repatriation of call centre work was an issue that the union had prior, unrelated, discussions with BT about; she gave no indication to \"Wikinews\" this was, or was not, part of BT's revised offer.\nThe press release, shortly after 1630 BST, expressed clear intent to carry on with the process of balloting members on strike action. In the statement, CWU DGS Andy Kerr states, \"[w]e're very disappointed that BT's revised offer remains materially unchanged for this year in terms of pay.\"\nContinuing, he emphasised, \"[...] we've made clear, 2 per cent is unacceptable for our members as it does not reflect the reward they expect given the contribution they have made to cost savings of \u00a31.75 billion and profits of over \u00a31bn. In addition, inflation is at 5.3 per cent and staff are comparing this offer with the large salary rises and bonuses for senior executives which expose the blatant double standards being adopted by the company when it comes to remuneration.\"\nThe CWU statement also expresses concern over BT's disclosure of details within the offer; \"BT's decision to leak their offer to the media today has also raised trust issues for us with the company.\"\nAny sustained action by CWU members in BT's employ could have a major impact on the country's communication infrastructure. Millions of UK households and businesses are reliant on BT for internet access \u2013 in addition to services.\nFollowing the release of their statement, the CWU's Sian Jones confirmed that the union had not, as-yet, given BT the formal seven-days notice of balloting members on strike action.\nAny ballot would run for a two-week period; following such, the union would, again, be required to give seven days notice to BT; this time of their intent to take workers out on strike. She emphasised, \"nobody wants to be on strike\", stressing that the union last took such action in 1987, and would prefer round-table discussions and an improved offer.\nThe structure of BT's privatisation, and breakup to permit level playing-field telephony and broadband competition, would see other who rely on the ageing, once -owned, copper infrastructure unable to resolve customer faults. According to the CWU, BT has been querying managerial staff on their skillsets \u2013 as a form of preparation for any industrial action. A union spokesperson described this as \"laughable\".\nWhen called for comment on the union's rejection of their revised offer, the BT press office declined to comment at this time."}

When their bikes broke down, they hired Kasongo to drive them back to Uganda. The pair claim that during the journey they were ambushed by jungle rebels and Kasongo was killed. Because the former soldiers were carrying Norwegian military identification they were also accused of spying. \nOne of the accused holds dual Norwegian-British citizenship. UK-based charity condemned the actions of the Congo courts. A spokesperson said that \"Each time the military prosecution changes their theory, the witnesses all obligingly change their story. It is now clear why the DRC's own constitution forbids the military from administering justice.\" \nBoth suspects continue to defend their innocence, and Britain and Norway both expressed their opposition to the sentence. A Norwegian spokesperson said that \"Norway is a strong opponent against the death penalty, and we have been communicating this stance to the relevant authorities. We have received assurances from the authorities that the death sentence won't be carried out and we hold the authorities responsible for the well being of these two.\" A spokesperson for Britain's Foreign Office said that \"We will be doing everything we properly can to support him in the coming weeks and months. We are committed to supporting any British national who faces the death penalty and our prime concern in this case is to ensure that no execution is carried out.\""}

She departed from , California on January 23, 2010 and was about halfway through the attempt when Sunderland's family lost communication with her Thursday morning. That night, an Australian plane was able to locate her 40-foot (12.2-metre) long boat, \"Wild Eyes\", which had lost its earlier.\nSunderland had been sailing amid a rough storm in the Indian Ocean early Thursday when her boat was flipped over. The mast broke off as a consequence. After losing contact, the teenager activated two manual , or EPIRBs, and a search-and-rescue operation was formed. As part of the operation, a Qantas Airways was sent over the ocean by Australian authorities. The plane's crew was able to make radio contact with Sunderland, and confirmed that she was not injured and that her boat was upright, but was unable to continue sailing. The closest rescue boat, a French fishing ship, was about 24 hours away from Sunderland's location when she was found, and is expected to meet her later today. She was stranded about 2000 miles (3218.7 kilometres) southwest of Australia's coast.\nThis is not Sunderland's first obstacle during the journey. Near the beginning of the voyage, she made a stop at , Mexico, after the boat's generators were not producing enough power. She resumed the attempt in February, but autopilot problems forced another stop at , South Africa for repairs in April, and she had to give up going for the unassisted record.\nSunderland's parents, Laurence and Marianne, have vigorously defended against claims that their daughter was too young to be attempting such a feat. They have also been criticized for allowing her to depart the United States at the beginning of the year, because Sunderland would likely arrive in the Indian Ocean during the region's winter. Marianne Sunderland has said that Abby would likely not try \"something of this magnitude again.\" Last year, her brother had completed a circumnavigation when he sailed solo around the world at the age of seventeen. She had begun preparing for this journey at the age of thirteen."}

At least nineteen people were killed when the flood swept through the Albert Pike Recreation Area campground in the in the southwestern portion of the state.\nInitially, Arkansas governor said twenty people were killed when the flash flood reached its peak at about 5:30 a.m. local time on Friday morning, but as of Monday the death toll stands at nineteen. Amongst the dead are at least six children under seven who died when what has been described as a \"wall of water\" swept away campers while they slept.\nWith no record of who and how many people were at the camp site, rescue workers initially thought up to 40 people were missing, estimating numbers from vehicles and camping equipment remaining. Temporary cell phone towers have been erected in the area, in the hope that survivors would be able to call for help.\nSpeaking to CNN on Saturday, Bill Sadler, an spokesman, said: \"We believe there are still individuals trapped in the area.\" He added that \"The primary mission of the Arkansas state police working with the local authorities right now is to get the living out of that area and locate the dead.\" Most of those who had thought to be missing have now been accounted for.\nSurvivors describe having to cling to trees to avoid being swept away. Others escaped by climbing into higher ground. Rescuers hope that those missing can still be found alive on these higher grounds. The flood swept away everything from automobiles to RVs and, though it pales in comparison to floods like to much bigger flash floods like the Big Thompson Canyon flood in Colorado of 1976 that killed 144, many people at the site of the disaster said they \"had never heard of anything like this.\"\nSurrounded by mountains, the camp site \"filled up like a bowl\", according to Chad Stover, a spokesman for the Arkansas Department of Emergency Management. The area where the flooding happened is known as a \"flash flood alley\". This is due to the hilly topography, which creates a bowl like effect that drains rainfall into smaller streams. That means if there's a lot of rainfall, it will all go into the streams that can flood very easily.\nBefore the actual torrent of water came, the waters of the Little Missouri river increased at a very rapid rate. At 2:00 a.m Friday, the waters of the Little Missouri river were just 3.8 feet, according to US Geological Survey river gauge logs. However, it surged to 10 feet over the next hour and peaked at 23.4 feet, which is almost 20 feet above the river's norm. It also exceeded the river's previous record by 10 feet. After the peak, the river dropped back to 8 feet by noon. \nRaymond Slade, a Texas-based U.S Geological Survey hydrologist and an expert on floods, said that the amount of rainfall could have exceeded seven inches in an hour, a phenomenon so rare that scientists call that a \"100-year rainfall\". Slade says that \"This was much greater than a 100-year rainfall. That flood that occurred was much bigger than a 100-year flood, where those people were camped.\""}

The ICRC describes how the blockade has seriously impoverished the people of Gaza, as well as denying them basic access to housing, food and health care. The ICRC claims the blockade has almost totally destroyed Gaza's economy, which is kept on life support by an elaborate tunnel system used to smuggle in goods. Even though Israel has stated that it no longer occupies the Gaza Strip, the ICRC said that the country still denies Gazans access to their fishing grounds, causing great economic hardship.\nOutlining the condition of the health care system in Gaza, the ICRC stated that electricity blackouts are on average seven hours a day, meaning that hospitals must run on generators. Generators can take two to three minutes to start, a luxury many patients cannot afford. To make matters worse fuel supplies for the generators are erratic, and the ICRC reported that already three times in 2010 Gaza's hospitals have run out of fuel.\nThe statement also highlighted a potential risk to Gaza's water supply. According to the ICRC, only 60% of Gaza's 1.4 million inhabitants are connected to a sewage collection system, and raw sewage is dumped into the Wadi Gaza river, posing a great health risk to many families living alongside the river, where overused aquifers results in drinking water unfit for consumption with \"high levels of nitrate, chloride and salt\". \nThe ICRC has urged for the rights of Israeli soldier , who is held prisoner by Hamas, to be respected.

The Sea Org consists of 6,000 members of Scientology, who sign billion-year contracts to work for the organization for multiple lifetimes. Joining the Sea Org is considered a high calling within Scientology.\n, the founder of Scientology, stated his appreciation for families within the Sea Org. Scientology's subsequent leader, David Miscavige, issued an order that children were to be banned in the Sea Org. The mandate by Miscavige asserted that children hampered the productivity of the Scientology order.\nScientology representative, denied all of the assertions made by the women. \"There is no church policy to convince anyone to have an abortion, and the church has never engaged in such activity. The decision to have a child or terminate a pregnancy is a personal decision made by a couple. That applies to all Scientologists. If any current or former Sea Org member ever 'pressured' someone to have an abortion, they did so independently, and that action was not approved, endorsed or advocated by the church,\" stated Davis to the \"St. Petersburg Times\". \nAnother woman is suing the Scientology organization in , and stated she was threatened with severe repercussions if she did not have an abortion. Claire Headley, 35, a member of the Sea Org when she was in Scientology, told the \"St. Petersburg Times\", \"The policy was if a staff member became pregnant, that they were to have an abortion.\" \nIn 1991, Headley became a member of the Sea Org at age sixteen, and began work with the division of the organization in Los Angeles, California. She married at age seventeen, while a member of the organization. Headley said that officials within Scientology leadership pressured her to have two abortions: one at age nineteen, and another at age 21. Headley believed she had \"no choice\", as she had witnessed other women that refused to have abortions instructed to perform manual labor, with one pregnant woman ordered to dig ditches. Headley said that during pressure to have her second abortion she was forbidden to phone her husband to discuss the decision. She spent a total of thirteen years in the Sea Org.\nLaura Dieckman, 31, said that she was enthusiastic about beginning a family when she became pregnant within Scientology at age seventeen, but was instructed to have an abortion. In a federal lawsuit against Scientology, Dieckman stated she joined with the Sea Org at the age of twelve, and at age sixteen she married another member of the group, Jesse DeCrescenzo. She said she was pressured to have an abortion in 1996. \nDieckman said to the \"St. Petersburg Times\": \"I was pounded for two days by the top person in my organization ... about how the baby wasn't a baby yet, it was just tissue and it wouldn't matter if I aborted the baby.\" Dieckman left Scientology in 2004. In a video posted to the website of the \"St. Petersburg Times\", Dieckman emotionally recounted how she had immediately regretted going through with the procedure, \"They will do an ultrasound before the procedure so you see the heartbeat. ... I'm lying there ... and I was like, 'No.' But it's too late. I'd already done it.\"\nNatalie Hagemo said that 20 years ago at age nineteen, she was pressured by Scientology officials to have an abortion, but she resisted. Hagemo gave birth to Shelby on August 20, 1990. Hagemo's daughter was recruited into the Sea Org at age 14. Shelby contacted her mother a week later wanting to leave the Sea Org; Hagemo had a difficult time getting Shelby out of the group. It was not until this year that Hagemo told her daughter about experiencing pressure from Scientology officials to have an abortion.\nThe \"St. Petersburg Times\" received sworn depositions from additional women including Sunny Pereira, who said they were intimidated into having abortions they did not wish to undergo. \"They put you in this position where you're weighing the lives of all these people you're supposed to be saving against this one little tiny speck of nuisance that's growing inside of you,\" said Pereira.

His execution was performed by five volunteer riflemen. Gardner would not have seen his executioners due to bright lights during his final words before a bag was placed over his head. The execution was carried out at a prison in Draper, a suburb of Salt Lake City.\nThis is the first execution by firing squad carried out in the United States since John Albert Taylor on January 26th, 1996. Taylor was convicted of raping and then murdering an eleven year old girl. Gardener chose his death by firing squad because he murdered with a gun and so stated he would die by the gun. The first man in Utah to be executed by firing squad was Gary Gilmore in 1977 for murdering two people. \nIn 1985, Gardner was convicted of fatally shooting a lawyer, Michael Burdell, during a failed attempt at escaping a courthouse. This was during his trial for the murder of Melvyn Otterstrom in 1984.\nThe five volunteers were not informed if they were given a live or blank round to ensure that they did not know if they gave the lethal shot. Gardner was asked if he had any final words and said: \"I do not. No.\" There was then a count-down from five, with the guns being fired on two. Utah Attorney General Mark Shurtleff used the Twitter micro-blogging site to say he had given the go-ahead for execution. \"May God grant him the mercy he denied his victims\". Friends and family members had gathered outside the prison to hold a vigil with some wearing t-shirts showing his prison number, but none were allowed to view the execution.\nIn 2004, Utah passed legislation stating that all death-row inmates will be killed by lethal injection, however those sentenced before 2004 are allowed to opt for the death by firing squad, as Gardner did."}

Later, head of Investigating Committee of the Prosecution Office said he will \"personally check\" the course of investigation into actions by Kuznetsov and his coworkers. In 2007 and 2008, Magnitsky worked in Russia for American investment fund company and was involved in the disclosure of a large-scale corruption among several top law enforcement officials in Moscow. \nLawyers concerned with the death of Magnitsky, which occurred in on November 16 of last year, started the bilingual website \"russian-untouchables.com\", where they presented evidence of Artem Kuznetsov's alleged efforts to cloak the crimes. As reported by the website's authors, Kuznetsov was a key player in a US$230 million theft from the Russian government and then successfully brought criminal charges against everyone who reported his theft. \nThe central part of website material is a ten-minute video providing a summary of the case. Its main point is the fact that multiple large-scale luxury buyings registered to members of Kuznetsov's family; they are not comparable to official income of all of these persons. It is emphasized in the video that Kuznetsov's official monthly income is $850 per month (in ), and to gain all the assets found to be connected with him he would have to work for 322 years.

Recently there were many cases when civil groups and private persons publicly reported alleged large-scale corruption crimes within top Russian authorities, with some evidence provided."}

Byrd later explicitly and repeatedly denounced his former segregationist views.\nByrd is the only Senator to have voted against the nominations of African-American justices and Marshall's successor following his retirement, . Byrd's opposition of Thomas was based on the testimony of who accused Thomas of sexually harassing her and due to the fact that Byrd felt Thomas was \"injecting racism\" into the debate by using the phrase \"high-tech lynching of uppity blacks\" in his defense against the allegations.\nByrd, who supported the , was one of the most outspoken critics of the . He voted against the . Byrd spoke on the eve the invasion saying, \"Today I weep for my country. [...] No more is the image of America one of strong, yet benevolent peacekeeper. The image of America has changed. Around the globe, our friends mistrust us, our word is disputed, our intentions are questioned.

In a Monday night news release, the fire department said that lab workers had turned on the hydrogen but did not recognize warning signs indicating a dangerously high level of hydrogen gas in the lab, so they left the gas supply running.

The explosion happened on a third-story lab assigned to Judy Wall, a university professor, who was in her office across from the lab during the incident and referred inquiries to the news bureau.

The malfunction occurred while the spacecraft was at a distance of several kilometers from the orbital outpost, and there was never any threat to the spacecraft or the station, report NASA officials. \"The Progress literally flew past the station, but at a safe distance from the outpost,\" says NASA commentator Rob Navias, \"The station crew reported seeing the Progress drift beyond their view, as they worked to reestablish telemetry with the spacecraft.\"\nThe Progress supply ship was intended to deliver food, water, fuel, and other supplies to the space station and was launched earlier this week. According to Russian officials, no additional docking attempts will be made today. Flight controllers in Moscow are analyzing the problem and are weighing the possibility of a second docking attempt within 48 hours, but this still remains to be determined."}

They were joined by representatives from the the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF); Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA); the (CBP); and other national safety agencies. Fireworks are often used to celebrate the United States' July 4, 1776 independence from . The is a time when many US families get together to celebrate, by holding reunions, picnics, barbecues, baseball games and displays; however, celebrations often turn sour due to injury or even death, caused by the mishandling of fireworks. In 2009, nearly 19,000 fireworks-related injuries were treated in hospitals, doctors' offices and clinics all over the country. Around 9,000 of those were to children aged under 18, and 6,000 occurred during the 30 days surrounding Independence Day.\nCPSC chairman, Inez Tenenbaum, said that burns and cuts to limbs, the face and head were the most common injuries, and over half of them were due to firecrackers, rockets and sparklers. The agencies were joined at the news conference by Jason Henderson, who was injured in 2007 after building home-made fireworks. He had found instructions online detailing how to build -style fireworks, and after purchasing the chemicals, began assembling them; however, the mixture exploded which resulted in him losing both hands and his right eye, and shrapnel caused multiple lacerations and puncture wounds to his entire body. \"Don't be the show, go and enjoy the show. I want to get people to move away from putting on their own displays and just go and enjoy the free shows. I mean they are free,\" Henderson said. \"You might as well take advantage of them while they are there. You can spend time with your family instead of being the one to light them and taking that risk.\" Henderson also appears in a public-service announcement recently released by the ATF to YouTube, that shows how he has now been fitted with bionic arms.\nAgencies recommend attending community fireworks shows held by city or county officials, which are held in a more controlled and professional environment. Additionally, many jurisdictions outlaw either all fireworks, or certain types, such as rockets and firecrackers.\nFireworks increase demands on fire departments and personnel at this time of year, acting U.S. Fire Administrator Glenn Gaines noted. \"Four firefighters [have been killed] as a result of illegal fireworks. Calls to EMS [] and fire departments increased as individuals continue to be injured and burned.\" The dry weather and heat that many areas are experiencing also elevate the risk of brush and structure fires. The National Fire Protection Association said that over 22,500 fires started from fireworks in 2008.\nConsumers who do purchase fireworks are encouraged to follow the following common sense rules: always read and follow directions; always supervise older children and teenagers if they are permitted to use fireworks; never allow young children to play with or ignite fireworks, child-friendly sparklers and \"party-poppers\" are a fun and safe alternative for them; keep animals inside or well away from the fireworks, the noise will often scare them; never light any fireworks inside buildings; light fireworks on a smooth, flat surface away from houses, dry leaves, and flammable materials; never ignite fireworks in metal or glass containers; light one firework at a time; move away to a safe distance immediately after lighting a firework; never return to a firework that has not ignited properly; never throw fireworks at another person, animal, or property; do not consume alcohol when using fireworks; keep a bucket of water or a hose in close proximity in case of fire, dispose of use fireworks in the bucket of water; buy from reliable dealers; only use legal fireworks; and follow the laws of your jurisdiction."}

By that time, a space shuttle and another Progress spacecraft would have arrived at the station to deliver supplies.\nAccording to NASA, Friday's abort was most likely due to the faulty activation of a TV transmitter, which led to loss of telemetry and the initiation of an abort sequence.

I am told people are walking into our shops and saying 'I will have what the Octopus predicted.'\"\nBut David Spiegelhalter, Professor of the Public Understanding of Risk at the University of Cambridge, was less convinced of the animal's abilities, pointing out that many other creatures failed to predict the correct outcomes of matches and went unreported.\n\"It's like seeing footage of a golfer getting a hole-in-one,\" Spiegelhalter said. \"We're not seeing the millions of times the golfer made the shot and it didn't go in.\"\nAt least one other animal has weighed in on the World Cup final. , a 13 year old parakeet from Singapore, allegedly correctly predicted the results of the four quarter-final matches, and also Spain's semi-final victory over Germany.

The iPhone 4 antenna is actually a metal strip that wraps around the side of the device, which has caused when held in a certain way.\nThe announcement came in a rare press conference held by Apple on Friday morning. During the event, company Steve Jobs attempted to address reports by both consumers and the media of signal reception issues relating to the positioning of the phone's antenna. Rather than recall the devices or offer a hardware fix, Jobs said yesterday that Apple will offer a free case to anyone who has purchased an iPhone 4.\nThe rubber cases, or \"bumpers\", wrap around the side of an iPhone and have been found to alleviate the reception issues. Apple's bumpers were priced at US$29 before the press conference, but will be free to anyone with an iPhone 4 until September 30. Jobs also said that those who had already purchased a bumper will receive a full refund for the accessory. For consumers still dissatisfied with iPhone 4, Jobs said that the phones can be returned for a refund as well.\nJobs acknowledged that \"a very small percentage of users\" were experiencing antenna issues, but dismissed the existence of an \"Antennagate,\" saying that similar problems plague all and that the iPhone issue \"has been blown so out of proportion that it is incredible.\" He showed videos demonstrating a drop in signal strength when held in a certain way for other to help make his point.\nAccording to company statistics, about one out of every 200 iPhone 4 customers have called to complain about the antenna. The iPhone 4 return rate is about one-third of the return rate. However, Jobs admitted that the percentage of calls dropped on the iPhone 4 was slightly greater than the percentage of calls dropped on the 3GS. Jobs attributed the small increase to fewer iPhone 4 users putting cases on their devices.\nIn response to critics saying that Apple had not addressed the reception problem quickly enough, Jobs said that iPhone 4 had only been out for 22 days and that the company could not have resolved the issue any faster. The press event came just days after \"\" declined to give Apple's newest phone a \"recommended\" rating due to the antenna's placement. The group said that Apple's move to give away free cases is a good first step, but not permanent enough to earn a higher rating.\nEarlier, on June 24, Apple told customers to either hold the phone without covering the antenna, or to use a case. The so-called \"death grip\", however, has not been as big an issue for other phones as it has for iPhone 4, said Mike Gikas of \"Consumer Reports\". On July 2, Apple associated the issue with a long-undiscovered software bug relating to the formula for calculating signal strength. An update released Thursday came with an updated, more accurate method of calculating the number of cellular signal bars to display, but did not actually prevent the signal loss that comes with covering the antenna."}

It shows oil and methane leaking from the seafloor at around 2:48 a.m. on June 13. The ROV monitors the leak for a minute and even gets covered in a plume of oil and sand before it moved on to the next spot. Smaller eruptions were seen as the ROV traveled, making the leak locations vary from 50 to 60 feet from the damaged well.\nUntil now, there was no way to determine the location of the ROVs in relation to the previously leaking Deepwater Horizon well. Alexander Higgins, an independent computer programmer, developed the 'Gulf Oil Spill ROV Distance Calculator.' Using the coordinates for the location of the Deepwater Horizon, and the location of the Viking Poseidon on June 13, \"Wikinews\" was able to determine that the first rupture and leak was approximately 50.45 feet from the leaking well or \"21.56 feet [n]orth and 45.61 feet [w]est\" of the Deepwater leak point.\nHiggins told \"Wikinews\" how he created the calculator, and says it is \"very accurate,\" but that the tool would \"not give you accurate measurements over a large distance, e.g. from the well head to .\"\n\"This tool was created using java script that uses basic Pythagorean theorem (formula_1) to calculate the distance between two points. The distance is simply formula_2. ROV coordinates match the location within a few feet when looking at the well because obviously the ROV can not be over the exact center because that is where the BOP is,\" said Higgins.\nBP, who owned and operated the Deepwater Horizon, has denied that any oil or methane gas is leaking from the sea floor. On July 16, Kent Wells, the senior vice president of BP, said on their official Twitter page that \"4 ROVs using sonar scanning [are] looking for anomalies in seabed floor. No indications any oil or gas escaping.\" Seismic tests were conducted on July 16; Admiral Thad Allen of the said that \"no anomalies\" were found, but also that the tests were \"not comprehensive.\"\nOn Sunday, \"Wikinews\" contacted BP, who authenticated the video, and asked if any ROVs were sent back to the crack and leak location on June 13 for further investigation. According to their office in , England, they \"sent ROVs to investigate and monitor that and no further signs of oil or gas were found.\" They also stated that they \"have continued to monitor\" and \"have also carried out seismic surveys. Nothing found to give concern.\" \"Wikinews\" also asked if they could confirm the location of the leak and crack, but no response was given.\nHowever, on July 18, the Associated Press reported that there was \"seepage\" coming from the area at the bottom of the Deepwater well head. For the past two days, ROV cameras showed bubbles coming from the base of well. BP said it would test the bubbles to determine what they are and as of Sunday, COO of BP Doug Suttles says the bubbles are not methane, but further tests are being conducted. \"If you can imagine, it is not an easy operation to collect those bubbles so that they can be tested to see what their make-up is.\"\nSince the June 13 video surfaced, other videos have been posted to YouTube allegedly showing some of the ROVs being tossed around by large amounts of oil seeping through the seafloor. One video showed an alleged eruption spraying oil and debris around the BOA DEEP C 2 ROV before it was tossed from side to side. It then immediately retreated to the surface. Some of the cracks on ocean floors, where oil has leaked from, have occurred naturally. One such oil spill in California in 2005 was the result of a naturally occurring crack in the floor of the . Some of those cracks can cause oil to leak through at a rate as high as 5,000 gallons a day, with most of the oil not even reaching the water's surface. In the Gulf of Mexico, oil leaks through natural cracks at a rate several times less than leaked from the Deepwater well.\n\"The Deepwater Horizon site releases 3 to 12 times the oil per day compared to that released by natural seeps across the entire Gulf of Mexico. By May 30, the Deepwater Horizon site had released between 468,000 and 741,000 barrels of oil, compared to 60,000 to 150,000 barrels from natural seeps across the entire Gulf of Mexico over the same 39 day period,\" said Cutler Cleveland, a professor at the university's Department of Geography and Environment.\nThe Deepwater Horizon oil spill started on April 20 after an explosion on the rig. Efforts to put out the fire failed and the rig subsequently sank to the bottom of the Gulf. On April 22, an oil slick appeared on the surface of the Gulf. BP capped the leaking well on July 13 which effectively stopped oil from leaking into the Gulf. The company has been running a pressure integrity test on the 150,000 pound cap for 48 hours. Earlier on July 17, they announced the test would continue for another day. BP hopes for the well's pressure to rise to or above 7,500 PSI. As of Saturday morning the well's pressure was just above 6,700 PSI. BP fears anything lower than the expected PSI could mean a leak in the cap or elsewhere, such as oil or methane seeping up from the seafloor.\n\"We are feeling more comfortable we have integrity. We will keep monitoring and make the decisions as we go forward. The longer the test goes the more confidence we have in it,\" said Allen."}

The leaks were detected early this morning, just after 4:00 ().\nThe HOS SUPER H ROV 1 made the discovery while performing an \"integrity survey\" of the well and well cap. It recorded what appears to be a thin metal pipe lining the outside of the oil cap. Four small leaks of what appear to oil bubbles were detected during this survey. The first appears just after the elbow connecting the pipe to the two green pipes. The second can be seen through the hole of the large metal ring. The third is seen just to the right of the metal ring.\nIt is not yet known what the pipe carries or what it connects to.

According to a new \"USA Today\"/ poll, Americans are losing faith in the president's plan in Afghanistan and Iraq, where wars have been going on for years and casualties have risen. 43% of those polled say that it was a mistake for Obama's predecessor George W. Bush to go to war after terrorists planes into the buildings in New York on September 11, 2001. Barely a third of respondents favoured Obama's strategy in the two Middle East wars. In another Gallup poll, just 36% of poll respondents supported the way Obama was handling Afghanistan, a sharp decline from 48% in February.\nThe drop in support for the ongoing wars (though the one in Iraq is slated to end soon) has been hastened by rising casualties and the Wikileaks leak of over 90,000 confidential military documents that paint a grim picture of the war in Afghanistan. About 76,000 of these have been released to the public. However, two-thirds of the people polled in the USA Today/Gallup Poll said it was wrong for the whistle-blower website to publish the documents, which have often been compared to the . Also, 57% of respondents said they want a timetable for removing American troops, and two-thirds of those 57% said they want a gradual withdrawl. \nObama's personal approval rating also hit a new low in the poll. Just 41% of poll respondents approved of Obama's handling of his job, while 53% disapproved. The above poll was conducted Tuesday through Sunday, and a Gallup poll on Monday had him at 45% approval. A poll has Obama's July approval rating at 46%, while 54% disapprove. \nAlso, according to another poll, Obama's quarterly job approval average has hit an administration low. The quarterly rating, which is compiled of Gallup polls averaged out each quarter, has sunk every quarter Obama has been in office, but at different rates. In his sixth quarter of office, Obama averaged 47.3% approval, which varied from 52% in a poll conducted in mid-May to just 44% in another one conducted in mid-July. The biggest quarterly drop that Obama had was from Q2 to Q3 of his presidency, when health-care reform ran into trouble. Obama's approval rating declined from 62% to 52.9% during that period. Since then, the approval slide has plateaued, with declines of 2% of average from Q4-Q6."}

Nineteen people were killed on Tuesday in revenge killings, bringing the death toll to 49 over two days. Twenty-five shops and a number of vehicles including trucks and buses were burned in a series of arson attacks across the city.\nHaider was gunned down while attending a funeral near the centre of the city. An officer at the police station said \"[t]he number of attackers and the mode of their transport are not clear, but initial investigations suggest that there were more than two people who came on a motorcycle and they were probably backed by armed men in a car. They first shot at the legislator\u2019s guard Khalid Khan and then entered the mosque and fired at Mr Haider who was in the room.\"\nFollowing the first night of revenge attacks and arson the MQM accused its main political rival, the (ANP), of supporting the Islamist militants suspected of the assassination. The MQM is a coalition partner with the ANP in the national government and is known as a party that holds great potential for mass mobilization in the province of Sindh.\nThe Associated Press (AP) said that the MQM's accusation \"appeared to reflect the complex and vicious political and ethnic fault lines that crisscross Karachi.\" \nThe AP also said that Sharfuddin Memon, the head of the Citizen's Police Liason Committee had speculated that Haider's killing may be related to a government operation against \"land mafias\", who illegally occupy commercially valuable land. According to the AP's report it is alleged that some of these mafias have the backing of political parties. \nAccording to human rights organizations there have been more than 300 political killings in Karachi this year. \nBy Tuesday evening the Jinnah Post Graduate Medical Centre had received 17 dead bodies and 55 injured. The head of the hospital, Dr Seemi Jamali, said that they had transfused 200 blood units to victims of targeted violence and that 31 gunshot victims had been operated upon that day.\nThis week's wave of violence and attacks began with the assassination of Raza Haider, but due to the nature of Karachi politics the exact motive behind Haider's murder is unclear. The Associated Press commented that the city has long been plagued by political violence between supporters of rival parties \"that draw votes from different ethnic groups in the city of 16 million people.\" The publication said this muddied the reasons for the bloodshed.\nRehman Malik, Pakistan's Interior Minister was quoted by media as saying Islamist militants were likely suspects. He said that Haider had been on the extremist hit list. The BBC reported that they had been told by security officials in Karachi that there is evidence to suggest the assassination was carried out by the , Pakistan's deadliest militant group.\nThe BBC News website also reported that senior MQM leader Babar Ghauri had said: \"Every MQM activist will now be looking to pay back the people involved in this heinous act\".\nRaza Haider was laid to rest on Tuesday at the Martyr's Graveyard in , northern Karachi. Hundreds of MQM members and supporters attended to pay their final respects to Haider and to his guard Khalid Khan, also killed in the shooting. The funeral took place under tight security, and with activists raising slogans against the violence that has gripped the city."}

Caliendo is a junior minister for justice accused of involvement in a secret cabal that reportedly tried to influence judical and government appointments. His resignation was called for by the opposition but, crucially, it was the abstention of 75 members of the senate, Gianfranco Fini's rebels, that led to the motion being defeated.\nThe abstention averted a confrontation between the coalition and the rebels but it can also be seen as a show of strength by the renegades, a way of showing their powerful influence while avoiding a dispute.\nAlthough superficially the motion's rejection appears to show that the coalition government can still be effective without a majority, The 's website commented that it demonstrates that Fini's rebels are now in a position to control the outcome of votes in the house, since their support or their abstention can mean the difference between a motion passing or being rejected.\nThe motion's defeat also means that the early elections that looked to be on the horizon may be put off. The elections could have been called early due to the rupture in the party but now may be postponed until later this year. Berlusconi's closest ally Umberto Bossi, head of the , said: \"This means that we are resisting and that we will not go to the polls for now.\" However Interior Minister Roberto Maroni, also of the Northern League party, said yesterday that elections later this year could not be ruled out.\nThe alleged influence-peddling that junior minister Caliendo is accused of is the same kind of moral and legal issue that has dogged Berlusconi's government, and the kind of issue that led Fini to lead the break away from the coalition. The Prime Minister may be facing impeachment after Italy's Constitutional Court overturned a law granting him immunity from prosecution. Even though the defeat of this motion means the coalition has passed the first test of strength, it may not do it much good if the Prime Minister faces prosecution."}

Following this statement a warrant was issued and Theresa Riggi was charged with murder.\nA spokesman for Lothian and Borders Police said: \"A 46-year-old woman has been arrested and charged with murder in connection with the petition warrant which was granted earlier today,\"\n\"Due to the medical condition of the accused, it is not at this time known when she will appear in court.\"\nIn an earlier statement Mr. Riggi released a statement saying: \"Our family is struggling to come to terms with the immense and tragic loss of three beautiful children.\n'Thanks to all who have offered such great comfort and support.\n'We request that the media respect our privacy at this difficult time.\""}

The reports it has left at least 1,600 people dead. The floods have been confirmed as the worst in eighty years.\nHeavy monsoon rains led to the flooding of the huge , destroying homes in the north of the country and causing a large amount of damage in the north-west frontier province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Manuel Bessler of the United Nations said: \"What we are facing now is a major catastrophe. We are afraid it will get worse.\u201d\nArmy and government forces have rushed to evacuate hundreds of thousands of people from parts of the Punjab province of Pakistan, where the disaster spread to yesterday, and from Sindh province, where the flood is expected to reach by the weekend.\nThe flooding is now in its second week and the situation is unlikely to improve any time soon, especially since in many parts of the country there is still torrential rain, with more forecast. In other parts of Pakistan the water has receded, but this leaves a layer of mud and slime and this covers very large areas. For those affected by the floods, disease is the biggest problem now. The insanitary conditions have already caused diarrhoea and respiratory infections. Cholera and other water-borne diseases may appear if sanitary conditions for those displaced by the calamity are not established. Medical supplies are desperately needed for doctors to keep a pandemic or epidemic of a water-borne disease from infecting the victims of the flooding.\nRelief flights.\nRelief has been hardest to provide in the north-west where many bridges and roads have been washed away. Whole towns have been cut off and this makes providing aid to those areas a very difficult task.\nAir force pilots have been volunteering to fly aid missions to badly hit areas, transporting medical supplies, clean water and food to where it is needed. The transport planes carry enough foodstuffs to feed one hundred families for a month. Motivation for the missions among pilots is very high, as is the tension in the transport planes as they fly at 36,000 feet over the flood-hit country. Only from the air is the full extent of the damage visible. Pilots have been flying the maximum number of hours allowed and pushing the limits of their endurance to give the victims of the flood food, water and everything they need to survive.\nForeign assistance.\nMany foreign governments and aid agencies are contributing to the disaster relief effort. The Army has been flying relief missions, airlifting people from areas where they are stranded. The first mission involved four U.S. Chinook helicopters landing in the tourist town of Kalam in the Swat Valley, north-west Pakistan. The resort had been cut off for more than a week, according to a reporter there. The Chinooks flew hundreds of people to safer areas lower down. A U.S. Embassy spokesperson said that 800 people had been evacuated and relief goods had been distributed.\nThe U.S. government pledged 10 million dollars in assistance following the first reports of the disaster. Yesterday the country promised a further 25 million dollars in aid. A spokesperson from the Embassy said: \"The U.S. is making a new contribution of 25 million dollars in assistance to flood-affected populations, bringing its total commitment to date to more than 35 million dollars.\" The money will go to international aid organisations and established Pakistani aid groups to provide food, health care and shelter to people displaced by the floods.\nMalaysia has also decided to contribute US$1 million for relief efforts in the form of humanitarian aid. The Foreign Ministry said the aid was a manifestation of the government and the people's concern and sympathy. \"The government of Malaysia hopes the contribution will help alleviate the suffering of flood victims in Pakistan.\"\nIn , the Disasters Emergency Committee, an umbrella organisation representing 13 of the leading UK humanitarian agencies, has been coordinating relief efforts and has launched an emergency appeal for public donations to help the victims of the crisis. Charities and aid agencies have been quick to respond to the disaster, sending aid and response teams to the worst hit areas. Food, water, shelter and medical supplies have been provided but much more is needed. \nRed Cross.\nPatrick Fuller of the Red Cross (the ), who has been based in the country for a few days, described the situation on the ground as \"desperate\" and said the worst hit areas are \"totally dependent\" on outside help. He said the Red Cross movement is working with local partners to get aid packages, containing cooking tools and shelter such as tents and blankets, to 35,000 families.\nThe Red Cross alone has distributed 10,000 food packs and 1000 tents across the affected areas so far. However, figures for the amount of aid distributed are constantly changing as this is an ongoing relief effort.\nFuller reported that in Nowshera, which is in the north-west of the country close to the Indus River, \"80% of homes have been badly damaged or destroyed, all the mud-brick houses have been washed away.\n\"In the most remote areas - where roads are cut off - donkeys are making eight-hour hikes to reach people.\n\"We are trying to move people into temporary camps - giving them timber, roofing sheets and basic shelter - but there is the added complication that many are reluctant to leave whatever homes they have left.\"\nThis has also been a problem in the south of the country in Sindh province, where the flood is expected to reach by the weekend. Evacuations have been going on to move people out of the path of the flood but many will not join the mass exodus and have chosen to brave the waters.\nWater, food and medicine.\n\"Many people rely on open wells, which have been contaminated, so access to clean water is a problem. We are worried about communicable diseases, like respiratory infections, skin diseases, diarrhoea,\" Mr Fuller said.\nThe charity have been setting up mobile medical teams to better combat disease and infection.\nThough the relief effort at the moment is focused on the survival of those hit by the catastrophe, on those who \"had their lives swept away in seconds\", the relief effort is expected to last a full six months. \nThose who will be most affected in the long term by this disaster will be the poorest. They will have had everything washed away from them so they will have to start from scratch. Sadly, for those living in the poorest areas in the north and centre of Pakistan, the fight for survival is only just beginning and though they may feel they are enduring much at the moment, getting their lives back together after the first stages of this calamity are over is going to be even harder.\nThe Disasters Emergency Committee has said it has managed to give aid to 300,000 people so far. Many UK charities have been distributing food and medicine, as well as water purification tablets, cooking tools, shelter and hygiene kits. They have been using rafts, boats and donkeys. Brendan Gormley, chief executive of the DEC, said: \"These devastating floods have left millions fighting to survive with little food, clean water or shelter.\"\nThe DEC has appealed for donations from the public of the UK to help the victims of this crisis. The appeal is to allow the charities to continue relief work in the worst hit areas of the country.\nFollowing a television appeal by the DEC, \u00a32.5 million was raised and this has enabled the 13 charities the committee represents to reach 300,000 people with emergency supplies.

The protest was held outside the International Convention Centre (ICC) venue in the British city, where the president addressed supporters of his and leading figures of the Pakistani community. Al Jazeera reported that two shoes were thrown at Zardari as he delivered his address, by a man who reportedly managed to break through police barriers to make a personal protest against the President.\nPakistan is experiencing the worst flooding in eighty years and it has been reported that the floods have now hit 14 million people. The president has faced criticism for continuing his tour during the crisis and though the messages of the protesters were many and varied, shown by placards ranging from \"Save Pakistan from American terror and Zardari\" to \"Stop killing innocent Christians, repeal blasphemy law 295 B and 295 A\", Al Jazeera's Alan Fisher said \"[the] one thing they all agree on is that he should not be here.\"\nInside the ICC, speaking to a group of supporters, Mr Zardari said the trip had been crucial in raising more than \u00a320 million in aid from Britain and France and for resolving the diplomatic rift between Pakistan and Britain, caused by British Prime Minister David Cameron's comments about alleged Pakistani terror links. David Cameron said on July 28 that \"we cannot tolerate in any sense the idea that this country is allowed to look both ways and...promote the export of terror\". The Pakistani President has said that his European tour is essential to mend the diplomatic rift these comments have caused.\nThe President's son has also defended the tour, saying \"He's doing the best he can and what he thinks is best to help the people of Pakistan.\" He added that \"his personal presence in Pakistan would not be able to raise this much money.\" \nThe said the President \"struggled at times to be heard above the chanting of hundreds of supporters.\" The chanting from the protesters arrayed outside the ICC could also be heard from where the President gave his speech. Many were calling for the Prime Minister's resignation.\nAccording to the the President's trip has been kept as cheap as possible, with Mr Zardari staying in the \"cheapest five-star hotel in Central London\" while he met with Mr Cameron. But at today's protest many held placards decrying the fact that while money was urgently needed in Pakistan the President was taking a tour that would cost the country. Two examples of such placards were: \"Thousands dying president is holidaying\" and \"while Pakistan floods Zadradi enjoys\".\nThe demonstration was held in the shadow of the Hyatt Regency Hotel where Mr Zardari has been staying. It is one of the most expensive hotels in Birmingham but the raised bridge that links directly to the ICC does provide the best security for the President. \nMohammed Khalil, a local official from the Tehreek-e-Insaf party, told the AFP that \"He should be there organising for his own people. Instead he's here with so many people. The government is paying all the expense for that. That money should be spent on the people of Pakistan, not on himself.\" However the President's son said millions had been raised from Britain and France because of the tour, and that the President would return once worldwide attention had died down.\nThe protest itself carried on for many hours, from before 2:00 in the afternoon until 4:25, when it ended with a prayer ceremony. The protest reflected the prominence of the Islamic faith in Pakistani culture, with a tarpaulin stretched on the ground to allow for Muslim prayer. National feeling was strong, shown by the numerous Pakistani flags being flown, and the presence of the closing religious ceremony and Islamic prayer mirrors the close-knit relationship nationalist and religious feeling have in Pakistan."}

If communication is restored it will help in co-ordination of rescue operations in a better way.\" Other institutions like Defence Institute of High Altitude Research (DIHAR), the ITBP camp, the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) and others have also been affected.\n1,314 people, mostly tourists, have been airlifted from Leh to Delhi. Three additional Indian Airlines flights from Jammu and Delhi have been planned. Three IL-76 and four AN-32 aircraft carried relief material to Leh this morning, and four more by Jet Airways and Air India and three by Kingfisher Airlines will carry relief material and doctors to Leh.\nThe ITBP has sent water tankers containing drinking water to affected areas. Medical camps have been set up in villages like Saboo. The bodies of eleven persons were transported to Jammu and Kashmir, Punjab, and Rajasthan this morning.\nIndia's crisis comes as Pakistan is experiencing the worst floods in the country's history."}

Much of modern cryptography, such as the and the , rests on certain problems, such as factoring integers, being in NP and not in P. If it turned out that P=NP, these methods would not work but many now difficult problems would likely be easy to solve. If P does not equal NP then many natural, practical problems such as the are intrinsically difficult. \nIn 2000, the Clay Foundation listed the \"Clay Millenium Problems,\" seven mathematical problems each of which they would offer a million dollars for a correct solution. One of these problems was whether P equaled NP. Another of these\nseven, the , was solved in 2002 by who first made headlines for solving the problem and then made them again months later for refusing to take the prize money. \nOn August 7, mathematician Greg Baker noted on his blog that he had seen a draft of a claimed proof by Deolalikar although among experts a draft had apparently been circulating for a few days. Deolalikar's proof works by connecting certain ideas in computer science and finite model theory to ideas in statistical mechanics. The proof works by showing that if certain problems known to be in NP were also in P then those problems would have impossible statistical properties. Computer scientists and mathematicians have expressed a variety of opinions about Deolalikar's proof, ranging from guarded optimism to near certainty that the proof is incorrect. Scott Aaronson of the has expressed his pessimism by stating that he will give $200,000 of his own money to Deolalikar if the proof turns out to be valid. Others have raised specific technical issues with the proof but noted that the proof attempt presented interesting new techniques that might be relevant to computer science whether or not the proof turns out to be correct. Richard Lipton, a professor of computer science at Georgia Tech, has said that \"the author certainly shows awareness of the relevant obstacles and command of literature supporting his arguments.\" Lipton has listed four central objections to the proof, none of which are necessarily fatal but may require more work to address. On August 11, 2010, Lipton reported that consensus of the reviewers was best summarized by mathematician , who expressed the view that Deolalikar's paper probably did not give a proof that P!=NP even after major changes, unless substantial new ideas are added."}

The study examined 1,239 girls aged between six and eight.\nThough the study did not address why US girls were reaching breast development earlier, it found that heavier girls reached puberty earlier. Marcia Herman-Giddens of the has said that the earlier puberty could be related to the rising obesity rate among US citizens. Currently, a third of US children are overweight or obese. Scientists and researchers are also worried about chemicals like (BPA) and that could disrupt growth hormones. The chemical industry says that these chemicals are safe and are harmless to humans.\nHerman-Giddens also said that it can be confusing to hit puberty at a young age.

The sensor uses genetically engineered frog cells. Since previous sensors were not very accurate, the scientist decided to try a biological approach. The invention was revealed in a US scientific journal yesterday, and is supposed to be used to design better machines to detect polluting gases in the atmosphere.\nPrevious smell sensors were based on quartz rods, which vibrate when a substance binds to them. The gases are distinguished by their molar masses, which can be similar for molecules with different structure, thus relatively often triggering a false positive. Trying to find a more accurate solution, Takeuchi decided to follow an example from insect world. As he explained, \"when you think about the mosquito, it is able to find people because of carbon dioxide from the human. So the mosquito has CO2 receptors. When we can (extract) DNA (from the mosquito) we can put this DNA into the frog eggs to detect CO2.\"\nGenes of several insects (the , and ), injected into African clawed frog \"\" eggs, allowed them to produce relatively inexpensive and useful sensors. The choice of the species was caused by their widely studied and well-understood protein expression mechanism.\nThe modified cells responded to three kinds of and one odourant, which have similar chemical properties. When a molecule of an odorous substance adhered to the receptor on the membrane protein, opened for a certain period of time, and a current was generated. Its magnitude was clearly different for all four tested substances, allowing to distinguish between them accurately.\nThe colleagues embedded the sensor into a mannequin, so that it could shake its head when a gas was detected. It was easier to observe. Pheromones and molecules with quite similar molecule structure produced clearly distinguishable reaction, with higher accuracy than other biological or human-made sensors. As the research group said, the detection sensitivity of the odor sensor is several tens of parts per billion (ppb), and it is as high as the sensitivity of an existing odor sensor that uses an oxide semiconductor. The distinctive feature of the new sensor is its capability to selectively detect some odorous substances, rather than its sensitivity. Very few false positives were possible due to the biological mechanism involved.\nAt normal temperature, the sensor lifetime is about 12 hours, which can be extended by putting it into a refrigerator before first use.\nShoji Takeuchi says has a great hope for research use in future, since the frog eggs are very practical for genetic engineering, and can be conveniently used to develop smell sensors for a wide range of gases. He said, \"The \"X. laevis\" oocyte has high versatility for the development of chemical sensors for various odorants. We believe that a shared ability to smell might open a new relationship between man and robot. .. The research will have wide implications... If the sensor is embedded in a nursing robot, it will be able to identify certain mouth odors or body odors. Also, it can be used for detecting CO2, air pollution, water pollution and food. It's very important for the environment.\""}

The restructuring is, apparently, designed to get teachers back into the classroom. \nDuring the week, staff, students, alumni and parents had accused the headmaster of being dishonest and not \"tak[ing] a single question\" on the issue.\n\u201cAt 10am there were 21 teachers with big question marks over their employment but by 1pm they had the assurance they would be able to apply for new positions before external applicants,\u201d union secretary Terry Burke said. \u201cMr Fairbairn said it was clearly the school\u2019s preference to continue the employment of existing staff. It is our view the existing staff are more than capable of taking on the new positions.\u201d\nSunshine Coast Grammar is a private Christian school approximately 95 km (60 miles) north of the state capital, Brisbane.\nTeachers' position.\nTeachers at Sunshine Coast Grammar school have told the Sunshine Coast Daily that they received no warning of any pending redundancies. Independent Education Union of Australia representative and school careers counselor Maria Campanini said \"teacher morale is very low and people are very disappointed and disillusioned\".\nMs Campanini said that staff were saddened by the handling of the situation by headmaster Nigel Fairbairn. \u201cWe got an email announcing a meeting and I thought it would just provide some feedback about the review,\u201d Ms Campanini said. \u201cBut the 21 teachers whose jobs were directly affected were herded into a room, Mr Fairbairn read out a prepared statement, turned on his heel and left. He didn\u2019t take a single question. We were just left sitting there in shock.\u201d\nAn anonymous staff member told the Sunshine Coast Daily that, \u201cSome teachers, who rely on the income and whose positions were abolished, were very distraught and they had to go to class.

From what I have gathered, Mr Fairbairn is not interested in having parents involved in the decision-making processes.\u201d\n\u201cMr Fairbairn is trying to go into damage control and his story keeps changing,\u201d said Julie Hopkins, another Grammar parent. \u201cHe\u2019s told parents this restructure was not financially motivated but has told teachers the complete opposite thing. This is it.

Seventeen positions are reportedly being opened up, eight of which seem to significantly overlap the old ones.\nHeadmaster: 'We are not cutting subjects'.\nThe changes are, apparently, designed to get teachers back into the classroom. \u201cWe are not cutting subject choices and extracurricular activities, but retaining a student-driven curriculum that integrates with the new Australian Curriculum, in keeping with our commitment to teaching and learning opportunities,\u201d said headmaster Nigel Fairbairn.\n\"Wikinews\" understands that Fairbairn attracted criticism when he was a head teacher in Christchurch, New Zealand, where a former student claimed that Fairbairn \u201creplaced the open and welcoming culture ... with the tyrannical and oppressive one.\u201d Fairbairn refused to comment on the criticism.\nGraduates embarrassed by lack of respect.\nFairbairn's statement came under attack from 2009 graduates who, in a open letter posted on Facebook, said, \"It is also hugely hypocritical to attack these teachers for not spending enough time in the classroom, when from firsthand experience the only time Mr. Nigel Fairbairn was ever sighted was during assembly (which he mysteriously stopped attending), never mind in the classroom, therefore, it is honestly astounding that he could make such unjust and incorrect statements.\"\nThey also expressed embarrassment \"to be associated with the name 'Sunshine Coast Grammar School' while you are at the head of the great community which Grammar once was.\"\nFour of the affected teachers \u201cwere the backbone of the school when [controversy surrounded founding headmaster John Burgess] happened,\u201d a former prefect (student leader) said. \u201cThey got it through that crisis and this is the thanks they get.\u201d\n\u201cPeople are angry and shocked,\u201d they continued. \u201cI am aware of at least 10 families who have said they will pull their children out of the school \u2013 it's that bad.\u201d\nThe student body has not ruled out protesting the schools plans. \u201cIt's getting to that stage,\u201d the former prefect said. \u201cPeople are trying to look at it in an intelligent way but there is so much anger out there.\u201d"}

In response to a chemical in the caterpillars' larvae, the plants release an odorous substance into air to attract another species of insects, called \"big-eyed bugs\" ('). These carnivores come to the scene and attack the caterpillars. The response is triggered within 24 hours, which is a relatively short period of time. The discovery occurred as a result of field studies in a nature preserve in southwestern .\nThe phenomenon starts with the recognition of the caterpillars by the plant. As a PhD student in the Department of Molecular Ecology Silke Allmann explained, \"The plant cannot see its attacker, but plants can sense the digestive substances that attacking larvae have in their oral secretions when these substances come into contact with the leaves.\" To test that, the scientists coated some of caterpillars' eggs on two groups of tobacco plants and glued them. On one of the groups, the glue was mixed with caterpillars' split. The latter got more attention of the attackers, getting 25% of eggs destroyed against 8% for the other group.\nAllmann supposed that \"The simplest assumption is that the larval oral secretions contain a special enzyme, probably an isomerase, which rearranges the Z:E ratio of the aldehyde in favor of (E)-2-hexenal.\" The researchers heated the oral secretion to destroy the enzyme, and applied it to wounded leaves. No plant response related to the studied process was observed, confirming the hypothesis.\n(E)-2-hexenal is a strong antibiotic agent. The food consumed by a caterpillar typically includes hundreds of microorganisms together with leaf tissue, which are mostly unneeded and killed by the above-mentioned substance quickly. Because of this important role of this substance, the caterpillars can't change their metabolism easily enough to prevent the subsequent events from happening.\nTo find out what happens after a caterpillar's presence is noted by the plant, Silke Allmann, a graduate student in Baldwin's group, examined the green leafy volatiles (GLVs), the substances responsible for the smell of fresh-cut plant parts. These substances are released into air if a plant is damaged. As the study released, the tobacco plant GLVs typically have a major share of Z isomers with very small amount of E isomers present. But the shares are distributed equally during a caterpillar attack. In a study with varying amount of different isomers present, E isomers turned out to be the ones attracting the predators to come to the scene and to attack the caterpillars.\nWhat is surprising, Silke Allmann found that the caterpillars are the direct stimulus of this change: caterpillar saliva converts the Z-isomers of the GLV molecules to E-isomers. Prof. Ian Baldwin commented, \"That's where it got really weird. Why would a caterpillar do this to itself?\" He suggested that the E-GLVs could have anti-biotic effect in the caterpillar's digestive system.\nThe speed of the triggered reaction is relatively fast, it taking about one hour for the GLV isomers ratio change, and about 24 hours for the predators to be attracted by the substance released into the air. As Prof. Ian Baldwin, who was leading the research, said, \"Other indirect defense mechanisms of plants require the activation of new metabolic pathways for the release of odorant signals, and these responses are much slower.\"\nThe multi-step intricate approach involved is attracting the attention of scientists, who are looking forward to its application in agriculture. Baldwin noted that \"in effect, the caterpillar calls the police on itself\", and suggested to genetically modify crops to release similar signals to defend themselves against pests."}

The purpose of Alain Robert's actions was to raise awareness of global warming. Following the previous like events in other cities, he was arrested and will possibly be fined.\nWhen Robert was 12, he climbed eight storeys to get into his flat instead of waiting for his parents to return. Since then, he has climbed over eighty buildings around the world, including the , , and Sydney Harbour Bridge. His hobby has, however, led to him being arrested and fined on multiple occasions\u2014he was fined USD 750 after climbing the 41-storey Royal Bank of Scotland building in central Sydney.\nHis most recent climb, which he completed in twenty minutes, began at the bottom of the Lumiere building in at 10:30am AEST on Monday morning. About 100 passers-by gathered to watch Robert, dressed in red trousers, a grey top, and a baseball cap, climb the building. Eleven-year-old Rachel Pepper was surprised when he saw Robert, who suffers from permanent after two accidents in 1982. \"I think it's amazing to climb that high without falling. He's got superhuman strength.\" His mother Wendy Pepper agreed, \"It was a nice surprise when we turned the corner and got to see him.\"\nUpon reaching the top of the building, the Frenchman unfurled a banner advertising the website of The One Hundred Months campaign, which argues that 100 months after August 2008, climate change will reach an irreversible point, as onlookers applauded his feat. Robert was subsequently taken into custody at the top of the skyscraper, and charged with trespassing. Robert was granted conditional bail to appear at the Local Court on Friday. Robert's agent, Max Markson, described the climb as a \"wonderful achievement. He's the best at what he does. I'm sad he's been arrested, but hopefully he'll get out soon.\""}

Last year saw the release of the 5th generation, bringing a video camera and a large range of colours to the Nano for the first time. But as Apple again prepares to unveil a redesigned product, the company has released their quarterly sales figures\u2014and revealed that they have sold only 9m iPods for the quarter to June\u2014the lowest number of sales since 2006, leading industry anylists to ponder whether the world's most successful music device is in decline.\nSuch a drop in sales is not a problem for Apple, since the and the are selling in high numbers. But the number of people buying digital music players are concerning the music industry. Charles Arthur, technology editor of \"\", wrote that the decline in sales of MP3 players was a \"problem\" for record companies, saying that \"digital music sales are only growing as fast as those of Apple's devices \u2013 and as the stand-alone digital music player starts to die off, people may lose interest in buying songs from digital stores. The music industry had looked to the iPod to drive people to buy music in download form, whether from Apple's music store, , or from newer competitors such as .\" \nMark Mulligan, a music and digital media analyst at , said in an interview that \"at a time where we're asking if digital is a replacement for the , as the CD was for vinyl, we should be starting to see a hockey-stick growth in download sales. Instead, we're seeing a curve resembling that of a niche technology.\" Alex Jacob, a spokesperson for the , which represents the worldwide music industry, agreed that there had been a fall in digital sales of music. \"The digital download market is still growing,\" they said. \"But the percentage is less than a few years ago, though it's now coming from a higher base.\" Figures released earlier this year, Arthur wrote, \"show that while CD sales fell by 12.7%, losing $1.6bn (\u00a31bn)in value, digital downloads only grew by 9.2%, gaining less than $400m in value.\" \nExpectations that CDs would, in time, become extinct, replaced by digital downloads, have not come to light, Jacob confirmed. \"Across the board, in terms of growth, digital isn't making up for the fall in CD sales, though it is in certain countries, including the UK,\" he said. Anylising the situation, Arthur suggested that \"as iPod sales slow, digital music sales, which have been yoked to the device, are likely to slow too. The iPod has been the key driver: the IFPI's figures show no appreciable digital download sales until 2004, the year Apple launched its iTunes music store internationally (it launched it in the US in April 2003). Since then, international digital music sales have climbed steadily, exactly in line with the total sales of iPods and iPhones.\"\nNick Farrell, a journalist, stated that the reason for the decline in music sales could be attributed to record companies' continued reliance on , CEO of Apple, saying that they had considered him the \"industry's saviour\", and by having this mindset had forgotten \"that the iPod is only for those who want their music on the run. What they should have been doing is working out how to get high quality music onto other formats, perhaps even HiFi before the iPlod fad died out.\"\nWhen Jobs negotiated a deal with record labels to ensure every track was sold for 99 cents, they considered this unimportant\u2014the iPod was not a major source of revenue for the company. However, near the end of 2004, there was a boom in sales of the iPod, and the iTunes store suddenly began raking in more and more money. The record companies were irritated, now wanting to charge different amounts for old and new songs, and popular and less popular songs. \"But there was no alternative outlet with which to threaten Apple, which gained an effective monopoly over the digital music player market, achieving a share of more than 70%\" wrote Arthur. Some did attempt to challenge the iTunes store, but still none have succeeded. \"Apple is now the largest single retailer of music in the US by volume, with a 25% share.\"\nThe iTunes store now sells television shows and films, and the company has recently launced , a new store. The is hugely successful, with Apple earning $410m in two years soley from Apps, sales of which they get 30%. In two years, 5bn apps have been downloaded\u2014while in seven years, 10bn songs have been purchased. Mulligan thinks that there is a reason for this\u2014the quality of apps simply does not match up to a piece of music. \"You can download a song from iTunes to your iPhone or iPad, but at the moment music in that form doesn't play to the strengths of the device. Just playing a track isn't enough.\"\nAdam Liversage, a spokesperson of the , which represents the major UK record labels, notes that the rise of streaming services such as may be a culprit in the fall in music sales. Revenues from such companies added up to $800m in 2009. Arthur feels that \"again, it doesn't make up for the fall in CD sales, but increasingly it looks like nothing ever will; that the record business's richest years are behind it. Yet there are still rays of hope. If Apple \u2013 and every other mobile phone maker \u2013 are moving to an app-based economy, where you pay to download games or timetables, why shouldn't recording artists do the same?\"\nWell, apparently they are. British singer has released a 'Full Moon Club' app, which is updated every month with a new song. Arthur also notes that \"the Canadian rock band Rush has an app, and the industrial rock band , led by \u2013 who has been critical of the music industry for bureaucracy and inertia \u2013 released the band's first app in April 2009.\" It is thought that such a system will be an effective method to reduce \u2014\"apps tend to be tied to a particular handset or buyer, making them more difficult to pirate than a CD\", he says\u2014and in the music industry, piracy is a very big problem. In 2008, the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry estimated that 95% of downloads were illegitimate. If musicians can increase sales and decrease piracy, Robert says, it can only be a good thing.\n\"It's early days for apps in the music business, but we are seeing labels and artists experimenting with it,\" Jacob said. \"You could see that apps could have a premium offering, or behind-the-scenes footage, or special offers on tickets. But I think it's a bit premature to predict the death of the album.\" Robert concluded by saying that it could be \"premature to predict the death of the iPod just yet too \u2013 but it's unlikely that even Steve Jobs will be able to produce anything that will revive it. And that means that little more than five years after the music industry thought it had found a saviour in the little device, it is having to look around again for a new stepping stone to growth \u2013 if, that is, one exists.\""}

While officials publicly announced that the men would not be brought to the surface until Christmas, sources inside technical meetings have revealed that they could in fact be on the surface by early November. The news comes as families were allowed to speak by radio-telephone to their trapped loved ones on Sunday. Over the weekend, video images filmed by the miners emerged showing the miners playing at a table and singing the . The miners also used the camera to send video messages to their families on the surface, saying that they regularly broke into tears, but were feeling better having received food and water.\nThe grainy images, filmed on a that was sent down a small shaft to the mine, show the men in good spirits, chanting \"long live , and long live the miners.\" They are unshaven and stripped to the waist because of the heat underground, and are seen wearing white clinical trousers that have been designed to keep them dry. Giving a guided tour of the area they are occupying, Mario Sep\u00falveda, one of the miners, explains they have a \"little cup to brush our teeth\", and a place where they pray each day. \"We have everything organized,\" he tells the camera. Gesturing to the table in the center of the room, he says that \"we meet here every day. We plan, we have assemblies here every day so that all the decisions we make are based on the thoughts of all 33.\" Another unidentified miner asks to rescuers, \"get us out of here soon, please.\" A is shown in the video, reading 29.5C (85F).\nAs the film continues, it becomes evident that the miners have stuck a poster of a topless woman on the wall. The miners appear shy, and one man puts his hand to his face, presumably dazzled by the light mounted on the cameraman's helmet. One miner sent a message to his family. \"Be calm\", he says. \"We're going to get out of here. And we thank you from the bottom of our hearts for your efforts.\" Another said that the miners are \"sure that there are people here in Chile that are big people, that are powerful people, that are intelligent people, and they have the technology and they will all work together to get us out of here.\" Speaking to the camera, one says: \"we have had the great fortune that trapped in this mine there are good, professional people. We have electricians, we have mechanics, we have machine operators and we will let you know that while you are working to rescue us on the surface, we are down here ready to help you too.\" It has been reported that Mario G\u00f3mez, 63, has become the group's \"spiritual leader\", having worked in the mines for over fifty years. He has requested that materials to build a shrine be sent down to the cavern.\nUpon seeing the video in a private screening, family members, who are living in a small village of tents at the entrance to the - mine\u2014which they have named Camp Hope\u2014were elated. \"He's skinny, bearded and it was painful to see him with his head hanging down, but I am so happy to see him alive\", said Ruth Contreras, the mother of Carlos Bravo, who is trapped in the mine. The video, of which only a small portion has been released to the public, shows the miners, many of them wearing , cracking jokes and thanking the rescuers for their continued efforts. The supplies are being sent to the men through a small shaft only twelve centimeters wide, and a laboratory has been set up with the purpose of designing collapsible cots and miniature sandwiches, which can be sent down such a narrow space.\n reported on Friday that \"officials are splitting the men into two shifts so one group sleeps while the other works or has leisure time .. On average, each man has lost 22 pounds (10 kilograms) since they became trapped three weeks ago, and dehydration remains a threat. But a survey of the men indicates that at least nine miners are still too overweight to fit through the proposed rescue shaft. Initially, the miners survived by draining water from a water-cooled piece of equipment. To stay hydrated in the 90-degree mine, each miner must drink eight or nine pints of water per day.\"\nBut while there are jubilant celebrations on the surface that the miners are alive, officials are now nervous that the miners could become , trapped in a dark room the size of a small apartment. Chilean health minister said that, on the video, he saw the telltale signs of depression. \"They are more isolated, they don't want to be on the screen, they are not eating well\", he said. \"I would say depression is the correct word.\" He said that doctors who had watched the video had observed the men suffering from \"severe dermatological problems.\" Dr. Rodrigo Figueroa, head of the trauma, stress and disaster unit at the in Santiago, Chile, explained that \"following the euphoria of being discovered, the normal psychological reaction would be for the men to collapse in a combination of fatigue and stress ... People who are trained for emergencies \u2013 like these miners \u2013 tend to minimize their own needs or to ignore them. When it is time to ask for help, they don't.\" NASA has advised emergency workers that entertaining the miners would be a good idea. They are to be sent a television system complete with taped matches. Another dilemma facing Ma\u00f1alich is whether the miners should be permitted to underground. While has been delivered to the miners, sending down is a plan that has not been ruled out. \nWith the news that drilling of the main rescue tunnel was expected to begin on Monday, officials have informed the media that they hope to have the miners out of the mine by \u2014but sources with access to technical meetings have suggested that the miners could actually be rescued by the first week of November. A news report described the rescue plan\u2014\"the main focus is a machine that bores straight down to 688m and creates a chimney-type duct that could be used to haul the miners out one by one in a rescue basket. A second drilling operation will attempt to intercept a mining tunnel at a depth of roughly 350m. The miners would then have to make their way through several miles of dark, muddy tunnels and meet the rescue drill at roughly the halfway point of their current depth of 688m.\" Iv\u00e1n Viveros Aranas, a Chilean policeman working at Camp Hope, told reporters that Chile \"has shown a unity regardless of religion or social class. You see people arriving here just to volunteer, they have no relation at all to these families.\"\nBut over the weekend, \"\" reported that the \"miners who have astonished the world with their discipline a half-mile underground will have to aid their own escape \u2014 clearing 3,000 to 4,000 tons of rock that will fall as the rescue hole is drilled, the engineer in charge of drilling said Sunday ... The work will require about a half-dozen men working in shifts 24 hours a day.\" Andr\u00e9s Sougarret, a senior engineer involved in operating the drill said that \"the miners are going to have to take out all that material as it falls.\"\nThe families of those trapped were allowed to speak to them by radio-telephone on Sunday\u2014a possibility that brought reassurance both the miners and those on the surface. The Intendant of the Atacama Region, , said that there had been \"moments of great emotion.\" She continued to say that the families \"listened with great interest and they both felt and realized that the men are well. This has been a very important moment, which no doubt strengthens their [the miners'] morale.\" The phone line is thought to be quite temperamental, but it is hoped that soon, those in the mine and those in Camp Hope will be able to talk every day. \"To hear his voice was a balm to my heart ... He is aware that the rescue is not going to happen today, that it will take some time. He asked us to stay calm as everything is going to be OK ... He sounded relaxed and since it was so short I didn't manage to ask anything. Twenty seconds was nothing\", said said Jessica Cort\u00e9s, who spoke to her husband V\u00edctor Zamora, who was not even a miner, but a vehicle mechanic. \"He went in that day because a vehicle had broken down inside the mine ... At first they told us he had been crushed [to death].\" \nEsteban Rojas sent up a letter from inside the mine, proposing to his long-time partner Jessica Y\u00e1\u00f1ez, 43. While they have officially been married for 25 years, their wedding was a civil service\u2014but Rojas has now promised to have a church ceremony which is customary in Chile. \"Please keep praying that we get out of this alive. And when I do get out, we will buy a dress and get married,\" the letter read. Y\u00e1\u00f1ez told a newspaper that she thought he was never going to ask her. \"We have talked about it before, but he never asked me ...

Their study follows a recent African outbreak of this parasite causes. The discovery is expected to help develop a cure preventing future deaths.\nThe 1998\u20132001 sleeping sickness epidemics in Sudan, Angola, Democratic Republic of Congo, and Uganda caused tens of thousands of deaths. The parasites are spread by . It is considered one of the worst epidemics in the last five decades. As WHO reported, subsequent recent introduction of population screening in rural areas and distribution of more effective drugs had potentially reduced the number of death incidents. However, the main effect of these measures being a decrease in spreading of the parasite and not in decrease of the death rate, the researchers decided to tackle the puzzle.\nThe scientists studied the molecules the human immune system activates in response to the attack. They were looking for the way the parasites inhibit it and lead to the death of the victim. Of the several known parasite species, the two that can infect humans were chosen to study, called \"Trypanosoma brucei gambiense\" and \"Trypanosoma brucei rhodensiense\". Several others also exist, but they affect only animals.\nResearchers knew that the Trypanosoma attacks typically are repelled by an , more specifically \"trypanosome lytic factor-1\" (TLF-1). It is generated in the humans' immune system and is toxic to the parasites but not to humans. It was known that one of the parasites, \"T. b. rhodensiense\", has evolved an inhibitor of the toxic chemical, called Serum Resistance Associated (SRA) protein. However the other one, \"T. b. gambiense\", was responsible for over 95% of human deaths, and it had been previously unknown why. \nThe study showed that a gene mutation has lead to a change in the parasite's surface protein receptor. It doesn't bind to TLF-1 as well as for other species, leading to a substantial decrease in TLF-1 uptake by the parasite. The receptor is more strict, causing a lower nutrient intake as well, but it suffices, and the parasite defends against the human immune system. \nAs professor and head of the department of biochemistry and molecular biology at UGA (and one of the leaders of the research) Stephen Hajduk explained, \"Humans have evolved TLF-1 as a highly specific toxin against African trypanosomes by tricking the parasite into taking up this HDL because it resembles a nutrient the parasite needs for survival. But T. b. gambiense has evolved a counter measure to these human 'Trojan horses' simply by barring the door and not allowing TLF-1 to enter the cell, effectively blocking human innate immunity and leading to infection and ultimately disease.\"\nBased on the results of the research, humans could possibly develop a defense mechanism to keep the parasites from evading the human defense system. Stephen Hajduk commented, \"We believe this research represents a paradigm shift and causes us to think more broadly about how pathogens avoid host defense mechanisms. It turns out that African trypanosomes have evolved a diversity of ways to avoid human innate and acquired immune systems.\""}

This is the first time this technology is being introduced on national scale. The bandwidths the users can deploy increased into two to three times, with Telstra becoming the world\u2019s fastest national mobile broadband service. The switch started with enabling the service for premium users. After some feedback, Telstra may expand the plan.\nIntroduction.\nThe higher speeds for wireless are intended to simplify and ease multitasking of users.\nJohn Paitaridis, Telstra's executive director, network products and services in Enterprise &amp; Government, said \"One of the reasons we decided to launch first to Enterprise And Government and Business customers is that clients are saying that their ability to access applications quicker makes a difference to their business and when they start to equate time savings and doing calculations around productivity it does become a return on investment.\"\nTelstra Business Group Managing Director Deena Shiff also stated that the efforts aren't as sudden as it might seem, having feedback of many users as the base.\nTechnology.\nPrevious modems were able to reach peak speed 21Mbps, with real life speeds ranging from 0.5Mbps to 8 Mbps. The theoretically expected maximum of the new technology is 42Mbps with user speeds varying between 1.1 and 20 Mbps. The new speed is twice as fast. This is caused by that the dual-carrier \"Evolved High-Speed Packet Access\" technology allows networks to send and receive wireless data using two channels simultaneously. This technology can be deployed on Next G networks. Telstra switched to them in February, thus making the switch to HSPA possible now.\nElection campaign.\nTelstra delayed the implementation of the new technology until elections end. This decision was intended to avoid wrong interpretation of them by . Coalition's claims include that wireless networks can be an alternative to the \"fibre-to-the-home\" proposal to introduce more expensive wired Internet. The announcement of the new technology, initially planned on August 25, was delayed, with Telstra spokesman Craig Middleton explaining, \"We just didn't want to feel like we were influencing the [telecommunications] debate.\"\nThe political parties have different plans on development and funds on the Internet. The Labor party aims to spend AUD 43 billion to bring 1 Gbps wired Internet nationwide, and the Coalition plans to spend AUD 6 billion to introduce a variety of improvements including upgrade of existing copper Internet as well as expansion of wireless Internet to support 12Mbps. Opposition leader Tony Abbott has said in the past that Australians shouldn\u2019t assume wireless technologies won\u2019t ever be comparable to fixed-line technology. Telstra's upgrade shows that wireless broadband is reaching the 100 Mbps minimum speeds promised by Labor's national broadband network.\nDistribution.\nTelstra has only 2000 devices which support the new technology. This is why the opportunity to try it out is being given only to the Business plan customers, and they receive it for the same price as they were paying for the previous NextG plan. Since October 5, the device will be available for sale, with the Business customers able to buy it with 75% discount and a prepaid data allowance. The upgrade is expected to cover roughly 50% of the population. This is happening at the same time as one of Telstra's competitors is doubling data download quotas on mobile cap plans.\nAs some testing showed, real life download speeds reached only about the half of the maximum. Telstra executive director of wireless Mike Wright explained that the predicted figures were the estimates, with real life speeds lower due to interfering environmental conditions: \"It's possible to achieve better than the typical user speed claims, but those claims occur in the ideal network environment with good signal quality. When you're out on the streets you get a lot of variation where the network is subject to signal quality, your location and the network load.\""}

Npower was fined \u00a31.8 million in 2008 by the organisation, and Ofgem insists that they are \"committed to taking action\" over improper sales activities by energy companies. \u201cSuppliers have existing obligations to detect and prevent misselling and new licence conditions were brought in following our probe to further increase protection for customers,\" said Andrew Wright, a Senior Partner of the regulator. \"We expect all suppliers to comply with these tougher obligations but if our investigations find otherwise we will take strong action.\u201d\nHead of energy at Consumer Focus, Audrey Gallacher, called the investigation \"a welcome step ... to address years of customers getting a bad deal on energy prices on their doorstep. While many doorstep sales people will do a good job, the pay and rewards system continues to encourage mis-selling, despite years of regulation and voluntary initiatives. If better advice for customers and enforcement of the tougher rules doesn't end the flagrant abuse of this form of selling the big question will be whether it should be completely banned.\" Christine McGourty, director of , which represents the leading gas and electricity companies, said that \"the companies involved will collaborate with the Ofgem investigation and are awaiting further details from the regulator. Any sales agent in breach of the code will be struck off the approved energy sales register.\" chief executive, Peter Vicary-Smith, has said he considers the situation \u201cshocking\", saying that the investigation \"will do nothing to improve consumer trust in energy suppliers. We're pleased that Ofgem has promised tough measures against any firms guilty of mis-selling. We hope it uses this opportunity to tighten rules around telesales so they are in line with those for face to face sales.\"\n Westminster Energy spokesperson , however, said that the investigation \"does nothing to tackle the real problem of fuel prices which leave many Scots facing great difficulty in heating their homes ... Rather than tinkering around the edges Ofgem should be looking at how to reduce prices for vulnerable households.\" Gareth Kloet, Head of Utilities at , one of the UK\u2019s biggest and most popular price comparison services, also welcomed the inquiry. \"It is unacceptable for energy companies to mislead customers like this,\" he said, adding that Confused.com has previously \"urged energy providers to either stop the practice of doorstep selling or make it very clear to households that better deals are available online. There is no reason why door-to-door salesmen can\u2019t show people online deals and even help households switch to them.\u201d\n\u201cOur research reveals customers could end up paying \u00a3167 more than they need to as door-to-door salesmen are unable to offer the discounts that are applied online. The changes that have been made to date are a welcome addition to safeguard customers; however this review has been much needed for a long time. Hopefully it will mark the end of customers being overcharged and missold,\" Kloet continued. \"Our message to energy consumers remains the same: they should shop around online to make sure they\u2019re getting the best deal possible and turn these salesmen away.\u201d"}

The Coast Guard confirms the platform was producing oil and gas at the time it exploded. They earlier reported a one mile long and 100 foot wide oil sheen which was spotted at the site of the explosion shortly after authorities responded to the scene, but later backtracked saying they could not confirm the presence of a sheen. Coast Guard chief petty officer John Edwards of the US Coast Guard earlier said that the platform, \"was not actively producing any product.\" Mariner Energy also released a statement earlier saying no oil sheen was spotted.\n\"In an initial flyover, no hydrocarbon spill was reported,\" said Mariner Energy in a press release following the explosion. \"The cause is not known, and an investigation will be undertaken.

Edwards earlier told that all those who were in the water were \"wearing some sort of an immersion suit that protects them from the water. Right now we're focused on search and rescue and then, ultimately, as this thing progresses we're going to be looking into the cause.\" \nThe explosion comes only four months after the oil rig run by in April, resulting in a massive .

These patterns changed more frequently than a few times per year along with seasonal phenomena. The study showed the monkeys' nocturnal activity increased in warmer months and peaked on full moon nights \u2014 but decreased during full lunar eclipses on full moon nights, which occurred three times during the study.\nLead investigator and assistant professor in U.Penn.'s Department of Anthropology Eduardo Fern\u00e1ndez-Duque explained that many animals change their activity levels with changes in environmental conditions. These changes are called \"masking\" in . But the species of owl monkeys is distinguishable by its increased activity during nights with better moon light.\nAs Fern\u00e1ndez-Duque explained, \"The behavioral outcome for these owl monkeys is nocturnal activity maximized during relatively warm, moonlit nights. While laboratory studies have pointed to the importance of masking in determining the environmental factors that cause animals to switch from nocturnal activity patterns to diurnal ones or vice versa, our study underscores the importance of masking in determining the daily activity patterns of animals living in the wild. It also suggests that moonlight is a key adaptation for the exploitation of the nocturnal niche by primates.\"\n\"Harsher climate, food availability and the lack of predators or daytime competition have all been proposed as factors favoring evolutionary switches in primate activity patterns,\" said Fern\u00e1ndez-Duque.\nTeam member Horacio de la Iglesia, of the Department of Biology at the , pointed out that the changes of activity, though seasonal, aren't a built-in biological clock. He was sure that they wouldn't happen in absence of the Moon. He stated, \"If there was a biological clock that they were depending on to regulate this activity, you could expect the activity to continue even in the absence of lunar light. The lunar day has not been a stable force as much as the solar day to evolutionarily select for a clock.

The BBC's Sarah Rainsford said that ETA is at the weakest point in its 51-year history and that the ceasefire may just be a ploy to disguise that weakness.\nThe group, which is listed as a terrorist organization by the European Union and the United States, have declared ceasefires several times before, which have all ended in a resumption of violence. The most recent ceasefire, in 2006, led to peace talks between the group and the Spanish government, but they were interrupted by a car-bombing at Madrid's . The bombing was frowned upon by all involved in the peace process, including other Basque separatist parties in the region.\nOn September 6 the Spanish government rejected the ceasefire, saying that the group cannot be trusted after the last ceasefire, alleging that the group was calling the ceasefire because they were too weak to stage attacks, and asserting the ceasefire is a way for them to regroup and rearm. Interior Minister said Monday that the group would have to completely renounce violence for the government to accept the ceasefire."}

Even though the church announced that it would continue with the plan, Jones could run into trouble as the Gainesville fire department has denied the church a permit to burn the Qur'ans.\nMany prominent figures have condemned the Qur'an burning. Yesterday morning, US president Barack Obama responded, \"... what he's proposing to do is completely contrary to our values as Americans,\" and warned, \"This is a recruitment bonanza for Al Qaeda.\" In his interview recorded on Wednesday for \"Good Morning America\", Obama stated that \"this stunt that he is talking about pulling could greatly endanger our young men and women in uniform who are in Iraq, who are in Afghanistan\", adding, \"This could increase the recruitment of individuals who'd be willing to blow themselves up in American cities, or European cities.\" \n, NATO commander in Afghanistan, said on Wednesday that the plan would endanger US troops worldwide. In response to the general's comments, Jones had told the press that \"we understand the general's concerns, we are taking those into consideration. We feel it's maybe the right time for America to stand up. How long are we going to bow down? How long are we going to be controlled by the terrorists, by radical Islam? ... As of right now, we are not convinced that backing down is the right thing.\"\nOther prominent people from around the globe condemned the plan earlier this week, including the head of the , . She called it a \"disrespectful, disgraceful act,\" while US Attorney General pitched in, calling the book burning \"idiotic and dangerous.\"\nRepublican Tea Party activist and former Alaska governor also chimed in, saying that burning the Qur'an would be an \"insensitive and an unnecessary provocation \u2014 much like building a mosque at ground zero.\" She also said that people have the constitutional right to burn the book, and that \"I would hope that Pastor Terry Jones and his supporters will consider the ramifications of their planned book-burning event. It will feed the fire of caustic rhetoric and appear as nothing more than mean-spirited religious intolerance. Don't feed that fire.\"\nCanada's Stephen Harper condemned the plan, saying that his God was a tolerant God, and suggesting that freedom of religion comes from a tolerant spirit. \nA coalition of religious leaders from different religions including Islam, Christianity and Judaism met in Washington to condemn \"International Burn a Koran Day\". People took to the streets in the Muslim-majority countries of Afghanistan and Pakistan in protest. In Indonesia, the country with the world's largest Muslim population, thousands of protesters gathered around the U.S. Embassy in on Monday.\nDue to the increase in tension caused by this activity, INTERPOL released an alert warning of attacks and asking member nations to contact the international police agency if they receive information on public safety hazards.\nDespite the criticism, legal commentators say that Jones and his church have the constitutional right to burn the book, which is considered by Muslims to be the word of God. \"The First Amendment, as it's been interpreted, would probably not win if it were put up to a vote. It is very hard to explain to people why this sort of conduct should be permitted,\" said Stephen Gillers, a law professor at New York University. "}

{"id": "204805", "revid": "39076", "url": "https://en.wikinews.org/wiki?curid=204805", "title": "BP report into Gulf of Mexico disaster lays blame on other contractors", "text": "BP released their report into the causes of the \"Deepwater Horizon\" disaster earlier this year on Wednesday, and shifted much of the blame for the explosion and subsequent oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, the largest accidental marine oil spill in the history of the petroleum industry, onto , the company managing the rig. The report concludes by stating that decisions made by \"multiple companies and work teams\" contributed to the accident which it says arose from \"a complex and interlinked series of mechanical failures, human judgments, engineering design, operational implementation and team interfaces.\" The report, the product of a four-month investigation conducted by BP's Head of Safety Operations, Mark Bly, criticizes the oil rig's fire prevention systems, the crew of the rig for failing to realize and act upon evidence that oil was leaking from the surface of the ocean, and describes how BP and Transocean \"incorrectly accepted\" negative pressure test results. The document goes on to note that the blow-out preventer failed to operate, likely because critical components were not operational.\n, who will become chief executive of BP, described the accident as \"tragic\". He said, \"we have said from the beginning that the explosion on the \"Deepwater Horizon\" was a shared responsibility among many entities. This report makes that conclusion even clearer, presenting a detailed analysis of the facts and recommendations for improvement both for BP and the other parties involved. We have accepted all the recommendations and are examining how best to implement them across our drilling operations worldwide.\" The report included 25 recommendations, according to a press release, \"designed to prevent a recurrence of such an accident.\" The oil company has previously blamed Transocean and , the well contractor, for the disaster and BP executives feel they have been unfairly blamed by US politicians for the disaster, and the report continues this view.\n, who was fired from the position of BP's chief executive following multiple public relations issues, squarley places the blame for the disaster on Halliburton. \"To put it simply, there was a bad cement job,\" he said in a statement, also claiming that BP should not be the only company to take the blame for the explosion. \"It would appear unlikely that the well design contributed to the incident,\" he argues. The report blames the type of cement used by Halliburton, designed to prevent harmful hydrocarbons from reaching the seabed, as well as criticizing the crew of \"Deepwater Horizon\", for failing to realize for forty minutes that oil had started to leak from the well, and once it was realized, the crew \"vented\" the hydrocarbons \"directly onto the rig\". \nDescribing how the explosion, which killed eleven rig personnel, occurred, the report states that \"the heating, ventilation and air conditioning system probably transferred a gas-rich mixture into the engine rooms,\" where the hydrocarbons ignited and a fireball engulfed the rig. But, the report states, the blowout preventer, the ultimate failsafe on the \"Deepwater Horizon\" failed, likely due to the fire on the rig. An automated system was not operational because the batteries powering it, located in a control pod, had gone flat, and another control pod contained a faulty solenoid valve. \nThe report was likely, however, written with the company's legal liability for the disaster in a prominent position, since they are facing hundreds of lawsuits and criminal charges as a result of the spill. The executive summary is four and a half pages long and the first page is made up entirely of legal disclaimers saying if BP was found to be negligent in their operations of the rig, they could be fined a good deal more. \nQuestions have also been raised as to why BP has chosen to release their report before authorities examine the blowout preventer. The energy editor of \"\", Terry Macalister, wrote that the \"catalougue of errors - both human and mechanical\" in the report \"demolish\" the oil industry's \"much quoted mantra\" of safety first. \"It may come first in the board room but it does not down at the wellhead where the real dangers are faced,\" he wrote. \"It is worth remembering that BP, its rig operator Transocean and the main well contractor Halliburton are the blue chip companies in the wider oil and gas sector. If the shoddy work practices highlighted here are what the best-in-class do, then what is happening in the lower reaches of this industry?\"\nTransocean described the report as a \"self-serving\" attempt to \"conceal the critical factor that set the stage for the incident: BP's fatally flawed well design. In both its design and construction, BP made a series of cost-saving decisions that increased risk \u2013 in some cases, severely.\" In a statement, the company listed five issues they felt had contributed to the disaster that were no fault but BP's. \"Transocean's investigation is ongoing, and will be concluded when all of the evidence is in, including the critical information the company has requested of BP but has yet to receive.\" Members of Congress, who are also carrying out a review into the disaster, also dismissed the report. Ed Markey, the Massachusetts democrat who has been investigating the spill in Congress, said that he felt the report was simply a lengthy defense of the oil company's handling of the spill. \"BP is happy to slice up blame, as long as they get the smallest piece,\" he said.\nBly acknowledged during a press conference in Washington that the report did not detail the charges raised against the company in Congress and that BP permitted a culture of recklessness to flourish. He did, however, reject suggestions that cost-cutting had put lives at risk and the rig was a disaster waiting to happen. \"What we see instead is, where there were errors made they were based on poor decision-making process or using wrong information,\" he said. \"The Guardian\" reported that \"the report is narrowly focused on the final days before the explosion rather than on earlier decisions about well design and safety procedures. It is also closely focused on the rig itself. No BP officials have been sacked for their role in the explosion, and Bly said there was no indication of any blame beyond the well-site managers.\"\nThe Associated Press reported that Bly \"said at a briefing in Washington that the internal report was a reconstruction of what happened on the rig based on the company's data and interviews with mostly BP employees and was not meant to focus on assigning blame. The six-person investigating panel only had access to a few workers from other companies, and samples of the actual cement used in the well were not released.\" The report continued, \"Steve Yerrid, special counsel on the oil spill for Florida Gov. Charlie Crist, said the report clearly shows the company is attempting to spread blame for the well disaster, foreshadowing what will be a likely legal effort to force Halliburton and Transocean, and perhaps others, to share costs such as paying claims and government penalties.\"\nHead of Greenpeace's energy campaign Jim Footner said that it was \"highly likely that a truly independent report would be even more damning for BP.\" However, he said, \"the real problem is our addiction to oil, which is pushing companies like BP to put lives and the environment at risk. The age of oil is coming to an end and companies like BP will be left behind unless they begin to adapt now. The time has come to move beyond oil and invest in clean energy.\" Alfred R Sunsen, whose oyster company operating in the Gulf of Mexico is facing the prospect of going out of business after 134 years, reacted angrily the the report. \"The report does not address the people, businesses, animals, or natural resources that have been impacted by the disaster and will be dealing with the consequences of their inadequate and slow response to the disaster,\" he said. The New York Times said that the report is \"unlikely to carry much weight in influencing the , which is considering criminal and civil charges related to the spill,\" and described it as \"a public relations exercise\" and a \"probable legal strategy as it prepares to defend itself against possible federal charges, penalties and hundreds of pending lawsuits.\"\nWayne Pennington, head of the geological engineering department at , also alleged that BP was wrong to blame other parties involved with the disaster. \"The blowout and subsequent explosion and spillage appear to the result of an overall attitude that encouraged unwarranted optimism in the quality of each component of the job, allowing the omission of standard testing procedures, and the misinterpretation of other tests in the most-favorable light.\" He continued: \"Instead, skepticism should reign on any drilling job, and testing and evaluation at each stage of the drilling and completion would then be routine; instead of questioning the need for such things as the cement bond log, the companies involved should insist on checking and double-checking quality at each step of the process. This was clearly not done, repeatedly, in the case of the Macondo well, and disaster resulted.\"\n4.9 million barrels of crude oil leaked into the Gulf of Mexico, causing damage to marine and wildlife habitats as well as the Gulf's fishing and tourism industries. Extensive measures were used to prevent the oil from reaching the coastline of Louisiana, including skimmer ships, floating containment booms, anchored barriers, and sand-filled barricades. Scientists have also reported immense underwater plumes of dissolved oil not visible at the surface. The U.S. Government has named BP as the responsible party, and officials have committed to holding the company accountable for all cleanup costs and other damage.\nDudley went on to say that BP \"deeply regret\" the disaster. \"We have sought throughout to step up to our responsibilities. We are determined to learn the lessons for the future and we will be undertaking a broad-scale review to further improve the safety of our operations. We will invest whatever it takes to achieve that. It will be incumbent on everyone at BP to embrace and implement the changes necessary to ensure that a tragedy like this can never happen again.\""}

Officials say that Israel will warn ship operators that their crew may be detained and the vessel held until impound fees are paid, claiming the backing of international maritime treaties.\n\"The legal approach proved effective as a deterrent, and we're prepared to see it through as a punishment. If we are to pay a price for defending the blockade, the other side will pay a price for challenging it,\" a senior Israeli government official. The official declined to be named.\nA European campaigner against the blockade, Anwar Ghabi, told Arabic news agency Quds Press that the new flotilla will be backed by hundreds of NGOs, including several human rights groups.\nThe first flotilla to challenge the blockade was stopped by Israeli naval commandos in May this year. Nine activists were killed, and several dozen activists and seven Israeli commandos were wounded after Israeli troops clashed with activists. Harsh international and domestic criticism followed. Subsequent aid ships were seized or diverted to Egypt."}

Furthermore Benedict XVI will receive courtesy calls from Prime Minister David Cameron as well as the leader of the Opposition and other political and institutional personalities.\nOn the last day, Sunday, the Pope will travel by helicopter to Cofton Park, Birmingham, for the Beatification of (1801\u20131890), a priest in the Church of England who converted to the Roman Catholic Church.

The Mural at Whitfield Gardens on London's was created by two mural artists and commissioned by Camden Council in 1980, but the mural has since decayed and been vandalised. \nPlans will be presented at a public meeting this Tuesday, to include details of the restoration and promote local public space in contrast to potential commercial developments and the focus of the London 2012 Olympics. If enough funds are raised from charitable trusts and public donations the mural could be restored during the summer of 2011. \nPlans to be put forward by the Fitzrovia Neighbourhood Association, and the , will present ways to fund not only the restoration work but also projects to raise awareness of conservation, heritage, and the residential and working community. The heritage and mural project hopes to involve many local people who could learn new conservation skills. Also planned are workshops with local children to involve them in their heritage, an exhibition by local artists, guided tours and a celebratory event at the end of the restoration project. In addition to this, a booklet would be produced containing collected oral histories of the people involved and a preservation trust to protect the mural in future years.\nThe playful painting was created on a Camden Council-owned building in 1980 by artists Mick Jones, (son of the late , trade union leader) and Simon Barber and is a mash up of scenes depicting problems faced by the neighbourhood over the preceding decade. \nThere is also a caricature of poet , who lived in Fitzrovia, and a mocking portrayal of then leader of the Greater London Council, Conservative politician , who is pictured as a bat-like creature. Other characters include an anonymous greedy developer and a property speculator counting piles of cash.\nPeter Whyatt of the neighbourhood association is jointly leading the project to restore the mural. Yesterday he told \"Wikinews\" he had a number of concerns about the possible success of the project.\n\u201cThere are a great number of problems with getting this project off the ground and we also need to act pretty quickly for a number of reasons,\" said Mr Whyatt.\n\u201cFirstly the mural is in a terrible state and deteriorating quickly. There is more graffiti being daubed on the site every month because one bit of graffiti attracts another bit. We really need to start the work in the next 12 months because going through another winter with the condition of the wall will causes more problems and inevitably more expense. We want to keep as much original artwork on the site as possible to keep the costs down. This is a big mural and it will be expensive to restore,\" he continued.\n\u201cAnd that brings me to my second concern: cost. If we don\u2019t get other community organisations on board to bid for money for this with us and to involve their beneficiaries and volunteers, it will be very difficult to secure the money needed. Money is very tight at the moment because to the current financial climate. We need to get support at this meeting on Tuesday and some firm commitments from people and organisations to get involved.\n\u201cLastly there is a danger of a commercial development on the site. A public-private partnership to create a new art feature. Because of the existing mural\u2019s subject matter \u2013 it mocks property speculators, and land developers, etc \u2013 a commercial scheme probably backed by a property developer would not want to restore the mural\u2019s original message. They\u2019d want some \u201cgood news\u201d scheme, some greenwash idea that paints them in a positive light. \n\u201cHowever, despite these problems, Camden Council have offered to do a condition survey on the mural. This will save us a lot of money. But having said that there are five council departments to deal with to get permission for this restoration work, and they don\u2019t always talk to each other.\n\u201cBut if the public and local voluntary organisations show their support, we can make it happen,\" Mr Whyatt concluded. \nThe mural restoration will be just one part of a year long project of heritage and conservation awareness-raising. \"The project is not just about the mural but also wider plans to promote awareness of heritage and conservation in an area of London under threat from commercial development. In fact the bulk of the project is about the heritage and conservation and the mural is just one part of it, and the most visible because of its situation,\" Mr Whyatt later added.\nThere will be a public meeting about the heritage and mural project at 7.30 pm tomorrow (Tuesday), at the Neighbourhood Centre, 39 Tottenham Street. The public can also comment about the proposals on the Fitzrovia Heritage and Mural website."}

Almost five months after an explosion rocked an oil rig off the coast of Louisiana and caused a natural disaster on a scale not seen before, BP yesterday announced that that the well has been completely shut off. Thad W. Allen, the former admiral who is heading up the response to the oil spill on behalf of the U.S. government said in a statement that the well now \"poses no continuing threat to the Gulf of Mexico.\" He also released a U.S. goverment department's confirmation of the news. \"The has confirmed that the cementing operation on the Macondo well was successful, that the well has been permanently sealed with cement plugs, and that pressure tests verify the integrity of the plugs,\" it read. BP released a statement, describing the sealing of the well as \"a significant technological accomplishment and another important milestone in our continued efforts to restore the Gulf Coast.\"\nEarly on Sunday morning, those aboard \"Development Driller III\" drill rig, which aided in the shutting down of the well, successfully conducted a pressure test, and concluded that cement pumped through a relief well into the Macondo well was going to hold. The tests concluded that the cement finally put an end to an environmental disaster that has affected BP, the wildlife on the coast of the Gulf of Mexico and the hundreds of people who make their living by fishing in the area. Forrest Travirca, who lives in Louisiana, said he was very angry with the response by BP and the authorities. \"All the brown spots and patches you'll see on this beach for the next nine miles is oil, too... And if you dig down a few inches or a few feet, you'll see oil, too. And if you walk into that marsh back there, you'll find oil,\" he said. \"So don't tell me we dodged any bullets. Or that it wasn't so bad. 'Cause I've been out there every day since May dealing with all that oil we dodged. It just makes my blood boil.\"\nAdmiral Allen admitted that the disaster was far from over. \"Although the well is now dead, we remain committed to continue aggressive efforts to clean up any additional oil we may see going forward,\" he said, adding that the response, lead by his team and BP \"has been driven by the best science and engineering available. We insisted that BP develop robust redundancy measures to ensure that each step was part of a deliberate plan, driven by science, minimizing risk to ensure we did not inflict additional harm in our efforts to kill the well. I commend the response personnel, both from the government and private sectors, for seeing this vital procedure through to the end.\"\nThe spill began in April, when \"Deepwater Horizon\" exploded, killing eleven people, after the blowout preventer failed. Oil began to leak into the Gulf, soon developing into the largest accidental marine oil spill in the history of the petroleum industry. 4.9 million barrels of crude oil leaked into the Gulf of Mexico, causing damage to marine and wildlife habitats as well as the Gulf's fishing and tourism industries. Extensive measures were used to prevent the oil from reaching the coastline of Louisiana, including skimmer ships, floating containment booms, anchored barriers, and sand-filled barricades. Scientists have also reported immense underwater plumes of dissolved oil not visible at the surface. The U.S. Government has named BP as the responsible party, and officials have committed to holding the company accountable for all cleanup costs and other damage.\nBP released their internal review into the spill last week, but it was rebuffed by the head of Greenpeace's energy campaign, Jim Footner, who said that it was \"highly likely that a truly independent report would be even more damning for BP.\" However, he said, \"the real problem is our addiction to oil, which is pushing companies like BP to put lives and the environment at risk. The age of oil is coming to an end and companies like BP will be left behind unless they begin to adapt now. The time has come to move beyond oil and invest in clean energy.\" The report concludes by stating that decisions made by \"multiple companies and work teams\" contributed to the accident which it says arose from \"a complex and interlinked series of mechanical failures, human judgments, engineering design, operational implementation and team interfaces.\" In their statement, BP said that they \"will continue sharing what we have learned in an effort to prevent a tragedy like this from ever being repeated. We also believe that the industry will gain important insights on how to be better prepared to respond to any future incidents.\""}
