A single gas leak near Battersea Park Junction interrupted services to and from both Waterloo and Victoria stations, the 2 main termini covering the areas \"south of the river\" in the metropolis.\nThe incident occurred around lunchtime, with trains being cancelled and delayed, and even once the leak had been repaired, the knock-on effects from the earlier disruptions caused delays to peak hour commuters returning home. \nThe situation was not aided by differential information being made available on travel news sources, a phenomenon that has become a familiar story since the once-unified British Rail was split up into an infrastructure operator and a number of different Train Operating Companies (TOCs)."}

The sources said he was among one of three known senior al Qaeda members present at the compound that was hit.\n\"He's the man who trained the shoe bomber, Richard Reid and Zacharias Mousssaoui, as well as hundreds of others,\" said former FBI agent Jack Cloonan.\nMursi has a $5 million dollar bounty on his head and is well-known for his chemical weapons expertise, strange alias, and red beard. \nTwo Pakistani officials also reported the son-in-law of Al Qaeda's No. 2 leader, Ayman al-Zawahiri, was also among those killed in the U.S. airstrikes. \nAbu Ubayda al-Misri, Abd al-Rahman al-Maghrebi who was Zawahiri's son-in-law, and Mustafa Osman another Egyptian who was an associate of Zawahiri, are thought to be among those terrists that were killed. U.S. officials also say that Khalid Habib, another senior Al Qaeda operative, may have been at the site of the attack.\nPakistani officials have been searching for the gravesights of the 4 or 5 terrorists killed in the attack where three houses were destroyed, but so far have been unsuccessful. Provincial authorities say that sympathizers probably took the bodies to be buried in the mountains to prevent their identification.\n\"We do not have any evidence to prove that they have been killed, but we have indications that they were there and were among those bodies that were taken away,\" an unnamed official was quoted by the Associated Press news agency.\nPakistani Interior Minister Aftab Sherpao had earlier stated that the Pakistani government had no knowledge of the identities of the foreigners who were believed killed in the missile attack.\nU.S. counterterrorism officials had no immediate comment on the report. The White House, as of Tuesday, has not made mention of any U.S. connection with the attack, but called Pakistan a valuable ally in the war against terrorists."}

This year, the morning celebrations at Waitangi were peaceful, and there was only a brief altercation during the afternoon. Celebrations also went smoothly at over 60 other sites around the country, except for a confrontation at Hayman Park in Manukau City between local Maori and National Front members.\nNew Zealand Prime Minister Helen Clark did not attend the dawn service at Waitangi today, or visit the lower Te Tii Marae. She hosted a breakfast for Northland civic leaders before taking part in other events around the country. In the afternoon she visited Hoani Waititi Marae in West Auckland, then attended the reception at Government House hosted by the Governor General.\nThe Leader of the Opposition Dr Don Brash visited the upper Te Tii Marae on Saturday afternoon.\nIn his speech at the Marae, Dr Brash said New Zealand needs to stop looking in the \"rear-view mirror\" and that the speedy settlement of claims is important for all New Zealanders. \nThe current Labour government has pledged to finish all Treaty claims by 2020, while National's 2005 election policy called for all claims to be settled by 2010.\nDr Brash said National is still committed to settling claims quickly, but because of the current Labour government, National's deadline of 2010 to settle treaty grievances is no longer realistic. The target will be reviewed in a National Party caucus meeting next week. \nDr Brash also attended the dawn service at the upper Te Tii Marae, where he was asked to offer a prayer; he said about the treaty we \"ask your forgiveness for our sins...none of us is without sin, we have all fallen short of the treaty promise\". The Prime Minister has refused to comment on the prayer.\nDr Brash then visited Hoani Waititi Marae, leaving before the Prime Minister arrived.\nThis year also marked the first time in a decade that the Royal New Zealand Navy (RNZN) has had a major presence at Waitangi Day celebrations.\nChief of Navy, Rear Admiral David Ledson says \"You can either build walls of silence or you can use words to build bridges...we'd sooner use words and conversation to build bridges than sit either side of a stone wall.\"\nAt dawn, the RNZN raised the New Zealand flag, the Union Jack and the White Ensign on the flagstaff in the treaty grounds.\nThis was followed by a church service and cultural displays. Several boats re-enacted the calling ashore of Governor Hobson to sign the treaty.\nThe annual hikoi (protest march) with about 500 people started at lunch time and marched from the lower Te Tii Marae, up to the upper Te Tii Marae and then to the contentious flagpole, where some protestors had a brief standoff with police. \nThe day closed with the flags being lowered by the RNZN in a traditional ceremony.\nGovernor-General Dame Silvia Cartwright said in her annual Waitangi Day address. \"Celebrations at Waitangi on Waitangi Day have changed a great deal over the years...[now] involving families, schools, youth and community groups...let us as always, remember our history, but let us look forward also to a bright future for our country.\" \nThe Governor-General arrived at Waitangi on Saturday, February 4, where she welcomed the Governor-General of Papua New Guinea to Waitangi before she attended a reception onboard HMNZS Te Mana.\nToday she attended the dawn service on the treaty grounds, followed by celebrations in Hamilton. She then hosted an afternoon garden party at Government House in Auckland, not at the traditional Wellington Government House venue. This is her last Waitangi Day as Governor-General."}

'I don't want to be associated with an organisation getting headlines like this'. \nFathers for Justice had been working towards removing the radical elements of its membership with an expulsion of 30 of its most extreme members. \nThe Police have claimed that they were aware of the plan but knew it to have not got past the talking stage. \nThis event has left the group in turmoil; they now appear to have no leader and their future is uncertain."}

But many other visible particles left tracks as they landed at 13,000 MPH and stopped fully intact. \"I remember warning people not to be disappointed if these tracks were very hard to see, but they are absolutely stunning,\" Brownlee said.\nBefore they opened the collector, Brownlee admitted that no one really knew whether or not the device had actually caught any particles. \"You just don't know if nature is going to cooperate or not.

Stardust's mission in space lasted 7 years.\nScientists also hope to use Distributed Computing to help with looking over the samples. They will use a VM (Virtual Microscope) which will be developed by the University of California at Berkeley. The developers, computer scientist David Anderson, director of the SETI@home project and physics graduate student, Joshua Von Korff, are expected to design the program which is expected to go public in March."}

The amount exceeded the organization's estimate of $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion in funds required to contain the avian flu over the next three years. In addition to aiding research efforts, the money is expected to help strengthen surveillance and increase the stockpiling of surgical masks and other equipment. \nThe United States was the largest donor, pledging $334 million in grants. Japan pledged $159 million while the European Union pledged $120 million. The EU member nations promised an additional $138 million.\nChina which is home to a third of the entire world's population of birds pledged $10 million to help other countries with the effort. Jia Youling, China's chief veterinary official defended the relatively small pledge claiming that China was still a developing country and faced a serious challenge from bird flu within its borders. Premier Wen Jiabao personally attended the conference and announced that the country would share more information on outbreaks in the country, including samples that will assist in tracing genetic changes.\nDr. Lee Jong-wook, the director general of the World Health Organization, believes that the Chinese government was fully committed to sharing information openly and freely about bird flu cases. But he cautions that it would be difficult to stay fully informed about every health development in a country as populous as China.\nDr. Lee also expressed his concern about reports that children in Turkey have now become infected with the A(H5N1) avian influenza virus without becoming ill. Some studies suggest that the disease must become less lethal before it can cause a global epidemic, he noted. There is concern that patients may continue to infect more people by going through their daily routines if the flu symptoms remain mild.\nSome scientists note that the avian flu has been known to occur among poultry in southern China since at least 1996. They are encouraged that the avian flu virus has failed to evolved into a form that is transmittable by people in all this time. This could be an indication that this would never happen. But others including officials from the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization disagree claiming that increased contact between infected poultry and people raises the odds that the virus may eventually adapt better for transmission among humans."}

The family of the deceased German hacker, known as \"Tron,\" obtained the provisional order in Berlin on December 14. The order was corrected on December 19 because it was at first addressed to Saint Petersburg, Russia instead of Saint Petersburg, Florida.\nTron became famous as the first person to crack the encryption of Pay TV and calling cards. He died in 1998, at the age of 26, in an apparent suicide. Questions have arisen as to the nature of the hacker's death.\nThe court has ordered the German Wikipedia to remove all forms of the hacker's complete civil name \"Boris Floricic\". The court states that this is justified by the fact that the hacker never worked under his civil name, but instead his Internet alias.\nThe legality of the order is in question, because the Wikimedia Foundation servers are not located in Germany, but instead in the United States. Whether the Foundation will comply or if the family's attorneys have any means to enforce the decision remains in doubt. The case prompted many German media outlets to publicly display the hacker's real name.\nOn January 17 the same court also issued a preliminary injunction against Wikimedia Deutschland e.V., the German chapter of the Wikimedia Foundation, citing the same reasons. In that injuction, the chapter was ordered to cease redirecting www.wikipedia.de to de.wikipedia.org. Wikimedia Deutschland complied, but its lawyers announced that they will appeal the decision, saying that Tron's civil name has long since been public knowledge."}

The Immigration Department says the single men in the group will be detained in the remote facility, and the six women and seven children will be accommodated in staff housing.\nThe group left the Papuan port town of Merauke on Friday in an outrigger canoe and landed on Tuesday at Janey Creek, north of the Mapoon Aboriginal community on western Cape York, without being detected.\nPolice, immigration and customs officials prevented the group communicating with media in Weipa, where the group were detained in Queensland's far north. The group was kept under close guard throughout the day, with the media required to remain at least 25m away.\nOfficials accompanied the asylum seekers on toilet breaks and trips to the Weipa hospital, covering the heads of the new arrivals with blankets or jackets. \nImmigrationl officials will interview the group, assessing their claims for asylum, while at the remote island detention facility on Christmas Island, 2,600km north-west of Perth.\nThe Department says the Papuans are being transferred as part of the long-standing government policy to process unauthorised arrivals offshore, not because mainland detention centres lack capacity. Immigration Minister Amanda Vanstone said the group would be treated the same as any other boat arrivals. \nJohn Wing from the University of Sydney's Centre for Peace and Conflict Studies says Indonesian military activity has been increasing in Papua which may encourage more people to seek asylum in Australia.\n\"This may be a trend that we see developing over the coming year or two as the military operations are stepped up in Papua against the local people. As in other parts of the world, the fighting and the human rights situation becomes too grim in one's homeland, he said, \"these people are forced to flee to the place of nearest sanctuary and in this part of the world, for the Papuans, it's Australia.\"\nMr Wing says he believes a prominent student activist is part of the group of asylum seekers. He says the man has already spent time in jail for attending independence meetings and could be persecuted if he is sent back to Papua.\n\"Many villages have been burned to the ground; houses, clinics, schools, churches have all been destroyed by arson, by the Indonesian armed forces, and some of these refugees are from that area,\" he said.\nThe Indonesian embassy says there is no persecution in Papua. \nThe 36 adults and seven children are the third boatload of asylum-seekers to land on the Australian mainland in the past four years."}

The chances of such a disaster were calculated by the United States Department of Energy at 1 in 350.\nThe Tuesday liftoff was postponed because of high winds at the launch site. The Wednesday launch was stopped after a severe storm near Laurel, Maryland knocked out power at the Johns Hopkins University's Applied Physics Laboratory, which hosts the flight control center for the mission.\nAs a side note, the probe is also carrying some of the ashes from Clyde Tombaugh, the discoverer of Pluto."}

The court was informed that a monkey catcher hired by the municipality had required 72 stitches after being mauled during an operation. After this incident the work had to be halted because other monkey catchers refused to take up the job. \nThe court gave the civic authority four more weeks to catch the monkeys that are disrupting work at the Tis Hazari courts. \"If you cannot perform your statutory duty, then close down your institution\" the court is reported to have told the counsel.\nDelhi is known to suffer from trouble brought on by monkeys. The animals are reported to invade homes, schools and government offices in the city. Scores of animals have moved in as the city expands into surrounding forests.

It currently owns about 50 technology companies providing financial services and other software over the internet.\nRecent investigations have centered around the acquisitions of two companies \"Royal Shinpan\", a consumer finance company and \"Cueznet Co.\" an online matchmaking firm. Livedoor announced its intent to acquire the two companies in August and September of 2004. \nAccording to allegations, an investment fund was used to purchase shares in the targeted companies before the announcements were made public.

After rounding the Cape of Good Hope the bottle must have then crossed the Indian Ocean. Oceanographers suspect the bottle could not have travelled the whole way on its own in only six months, and it must have been caught up by a ship and transported part of the way.\n\"It was summertime when we threw it in the sea. All the children in class were given bottles to take home in July but Alesha\u2019s is the only one that got a reply\", she said. \n\"I don\u2019t know what the other parents did with theirs. We went straight down to Morecambe Bay. Alesha was only 3 at the time. She could barely throw the cola bottle beyond her feet. I just assumed it would be washed straight back and forgot all about it.\"\n\"Then recently when I went to pick her up from nursery I was told that she had had a reply from this little boy and it had made it all the way to Australia. I couldn\u2019t believe it. I was walking on air for about four days and was really proud. It\u2019s made me very happy.\" Ms. Matthews said that Bob had made a copy of Alesha\u2019s original note and returned it to the Time For Nursery in Heysham. He also wrote to Alesha and the family is now looking forward to learning more about him.\n\"I have never heard of a message in a bottle travelling so far so quickly.\"\nLast December a message in a bottle sent from New York was washed up at Newquay, Cornwall.

On this issue, we have started transferring.

Traders have said that they had already factored such a possibility into the market.\nGary Samore, an expert on Iran and vice president for international programs at the McArthur Foundation in Chicago, said \"the move reflected concern by Tehran that the Europeans might take unilateral measures amid the crisis over its nuclear program.\" He also added that its decision to pull its assets from Europe \"makes sense in terms of preparing for the possibility that Europe might take some measure to impose some financial sanctions. I don't know that it changes the diplomatic formula. The key issue is still the question of whether or not the Western group can engineer a formal referral to the Security Council.\"\nIt is unclear if an asset freeze or other punishment is imminent in Iran, but it has happened before. The country's assets in the United States have been frozen since Iranians seized the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and held its staff hostage after the 1979 Islamic revolution.\nAn Italian court last year had ordered an Iranian bank account to be frozen at the request of U.S. plaintiffs who were seeking compensation for terrorist acts they believe were supported by the country (Iran).\nEarlier the EU drafted a resolution that calls for referring Iran to the 15-nation council.

Alito, Jr. to the Supreme Court with 58 votes in favor and 42 against. Only one Republican, of Rhode Island, voted against confirmation. Four Democrats, including former of West Virginia, voted for confirmation. Alito was sworn-in later in the day.\nAlito had been nominated by President George W. Bush following the withdrawal of his original Supreme Court nominee , a criminal lawyer and close associate of Bush since before his tenure as Governor of Texas from 1994-2000. Miers, facing harsh criticism of her qualifications for a position on the high court, along with growing opposition from members of the conservative movement, elected to withdraw in October 2005. \nAlito was nominated shortly after Miers' withdrawal, and faced the Judiciary Committee in January 2006. \nWith the Bush Administration facing poor approval ratings following the withdrawal of Miers, Senate Democrats put forth a strong offensive to the confirmation of Alito. They questioned Alito extensively of his record on abortion, exercise of executive authority, his opinions on various legal issues while studying at Princeton University and his membership in the group there.\nFollowing the Judiciary Committee's party-line vote approving Alito, efforts were spearheaded by ranking Judiciary Committee member Sen. (D-MA) and Sen. John F. Kerry (D-MA) to filibuster Alito's confirmation. However, the motion to end debate on Alito ended with a 72-25 cloture vote; Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) acknowledged that a filibuster was not a realistic option to stop Alito's confirmation.\nAlito is the second judge to be appointed and confirmed to the Supreme Court by President Bush. His first appointee, Judge John Roberts, was confirmed by the Senate in the autumn of 2005. Following the death of Chief Justice William Rehnquist, Roberts was immediately selected to fill Rehnquist's post. \nAlito will be replacing Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, who was a crucial swing vote in an ideologically divided Court. With the appointment of Alito, the Court will most likely experience a shift to the political right. How much of a shift cannot be precisely determined, as it remains to be seen how Alito will rule in cases involving critical social issues.\nAlito earned a bachelor's degree in law from Princeton University, and did his graduate work at . Most of his bench experience has come at the , where he has served as a justice since 1990, when President George H.W. Bush nominated him for the post. He follows current Supreme Court justice Antonin Scalia as the second Italian-American member of the high court.\nReactions.\nSenator Charles Schumer (D-NY) told the AP that the United States would \"be better and stronger and more unified if we were confirming a different nominee, a nominee who could have united us more than divided us\".\nSenator (D-RI) said he is concerned with Alito's \"philosophy of the Constitution [and] his great effort of many years to expand presidential power at a time when there are real serious questions about the powers the president has\".\nSenator Arlen Specter (R-PA), chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said there are no doubts about Alito's \"qualification in terms of education, professional career and his service on the court of appeals.\"\nAnd in a written statement, President Bush called Alito a \"brilliant and fair-minded judge who strictly interprets the Constitution and laws and does not legislate from the bench. He is a man of deep character and integrity, and he will make all Americans proud as a Justice on our highest court.\""}

Brooke Murdock of the Baltimore Circuit Court in Maryland struck down a 1973 law banning same-sex marriage yesterday, ruling the measure violated a state constitutional amendment prohibiting sex discrimination.\nThe decision will not allow gay couples to be immediately eligible for marriage licenses because Murdock stayed the order pending an appeal. The state's attorney general's office filed the appeal right after the ruling was made.\n\"Although tradition and societal values are important, they cannot be given so much weight that they alone will justify a discriminatory statutory classification,\" the judge stated in the ruling. \"When tradition is the guise under which prejudice or animosity hides, it is not a legitimate state interest.\"\nIn making the decision, Judge Murdock wrote, \"the court is not unaware of the dramatic impact of its ruling.\"\nKen Choe, a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union's (ACLU) Lesbian and Gay Rights Project, said \"men and women were indeed treated differently under the law Judge Murdock struck down. A man can marry a woman, but a woman can't marry a woman. Same-sex couples need the same protections for their families that opposite-sex couples do.\" \nThe ACLU hailed the ruling, calling it \"a historical step toward allowing same-sex couples to legally marry in Maryland.\" She considered but dismissed all the state's arguments for the restriction, noting \"Prevention of same-sex marriage is not rationally related to the state's interests in promoting stable families and protecting the best interests of children. ... These arguments are illogical and inaccurate.\"\nGovernor Robert L. Ehrlich Jr. released a statement saying that that the state will \"begin a vigorous appeals process. I firmly believe the institution of marriage is for one man and one woman only.\"\nGovernor Ehrlich had sent to Attorney General J. Joseph Curran Jr. (D), a letter in response to the ruling advising him to appeal the decision and offered additional resources to support the appeal. \n\"We have noted an appeal and think it appropriate that the court stayed the operation of its order,\" said Kevin J. Enright, a spokesman for Curran, in a statement. \"We await having the decision of Maryland's appellate courts.\"\nThe Maryland House of Delegates scheduled hearings for January 31, 2006 on proposals dealing with same-sex marriages, including a proposed constitutional amendment.\nJohn Lestitian, a plaintiff in the case, said Murdock's decision was \"a step in a very long process. As a 40-year-old man, I should be able to decide who my family is.\"\n\"This is such an exciting moment,\" said Lisa Polyak. Her partner of 24 years, Gita Deane, was a plaintiff in the case. \"Our participation in this lawsuit has always been about family protections for our children. Tonight, we will rest a little easier knowing that those protections are within reach.\"\nThe equal rights amendment in Maryland's State Constitution was ratified by voters in 1972. The marriage law which defined marriage as only between one man and one woman was approved the following year.\nThe lawsuit leading to the decision started when nine gay and/or lesbian couples and one individual sued court clerks in five Maryland counties for denying marriage licenses to them, citing legal, financial, and emotional harm. In July of 2004, the ACLU filed the suit challenging the state ban on same-sex marriage. \nSame-sex marriages are only legal in the state of Massachusetts in the United States, with the states of Vermont and Connecticut recognizing other civil unions. Hawaii and New Jersey offer some legal protections to same-sex couples, while 13 states have appoved constitutional amendments rejecting recognition of same-sex marriage.

The visit by the US Undersecretary of State is the latest in a series of diplomatic missions since July of last year, when the two countries agreed to co-operate in civil nuclear energy projects. Saran described the talks as friendly and very intensive and said \"We have shared with the United States our plans for a very significant expansion of our civilian nuclear energy capability over the next few years\". The two also exchanged views on regional issues surrounding Iran, Nepal, and Sri Lanka.\nSaran and Burns head the Indo-US joint working group on civil nuclear energy cooperation. India is looking to nuclear energy as a solution for its growing energy requirements. The country is hoping that the discussions will lead to the lifting of restrictions on nuclear technology transfer imposed by the US since India's nuclear tests in 1998. The US has requested a number of safeguards in exchange. India has been asked to separate its military and civilian nuclear programmes, and allow the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to inspect its civilian reactors while continuing its moratorium on nuclear testing. If the deal goes through, the US would be making an exception in the case of India, which is not a signatory to the (NPT). The two sides claimed that there is enough good will and trust to reach an agreement while admitting to have encountered difficulties that required more work.\nUS engagement with India.\nThis is the US Undersecretary's second visit to New Delhi since October and part of an ongoing US engagement that has recently involved others including Condoleezza Rice and US Senator . Later this year, President Bush is expected to bestow a state visit to the country. The trip which is currently planned for the first week of March will only be the fifth such visit by a US President to India. Bill Clinton was the last president to visit India in March 2000.\nThe two countries announced a significant breakthrough in July of last year when the US agreed to help India with nuclear fuel for its Tarapur reactor. This was a huge policy change since India had been denied use of for almost three decades while it remained outside the NPT. The Bush administration defended the move by describing India as a responsible nuclear power and announced that it would work with the US Congress on passing the necessary legislation to achieve full nuclear energy cooperation with India.\nThe agreement has some members of the Congress concerned with opposition from both Democrats and Republicans. Critics believe the deal could harm efforts to curb the spread of nuclear weapons and potentially jeopardize the NPT. The agreement also hinges on the details surrounding the separation of India's military and civilian nuclear facilities. This may not be very easy as some of the country's nuclear research facilities are thought to contribute to both fields. US senator John Kerry has supported the deal \"in principle\" while saying that the fine print of the agreement would need to be studied when Congress votes on the issue. Kerry is a member of the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee and met with the Indian Prime Minister and other senior officials earlier this month.\nEmerging global, regional power.\nThe US foreign policy towards India in the recent past shows a transformation recognizing it as an emerging global power and also an important player in regional geo-politics. Some believe that this is part of the longer term US effort to strengthen relations with Asian countries to counter the rise of China. \nRecently, Iran's nuclear ambitions have been the cause for displeasure in Washington. US alleges that it is attempting to build nuclear weapons while Iran maintains that it wants the technology only for energy purposes. , the chief Iranian negotiator with the IAEA complained of dual standards being set by the US and cited India as an example. Iran is bound by the NPT since it is a signatory to the treaty.\nUS Undersecretary Burns dismissed Larijani's remarks calling them outrageous and saying that it was not possible to compare India and Iran in the nuclear sphere. \"[India] has never been a proliferator, and has been very responsible in safeguarding its nuclear technology. On the other hand, you have a government and a regime in Iran, which the IAEA says for 18 years conducted secret nuclear research without revealing it to the IAEA.\"\nIndia which has had a long-standing close relationship with Iran has supported the initiative taken by the European-3 to find a solution to the issues related to Iranian nuclear program. Saran said that he would not like to see a confrontation developing in a region that is so close to India and recommended developing an international consensus. \nIndia which is looking to secure its supplies has signed a deal with Iran for a $7 billion gas pipeline project. This deal has been strongly opposed by the United States. Work is expected to commence in 2007 and the project will be owned and operated by a consortium from Iran, India and Pakistan as well as some international energy companies."}

Welshofer's supervisor had approved this technique except that Welshofer did not tell his supervisor that he sat on prisoners.\nThe prosecution described the techniques Welshofer used to obtain information from Mowhoush as \"torture\".\nThe defense argued that Welshofer's interrogation methods were covered by official policy. \nHis unit's commander Captain William Ponce wrote in an email three months before Mowhoush died that there were no rules for interrogations yet and that \"the gloves are coming off, gentlemen ... we want these individuals broken.

With dwindling food and fuel supplies, the Greenpeace ships Arctic Sunrise and Esperanza are heading for Cape Town. The Sea Shepherd's Farley Mowat has also left the area due to a refuelling cancellation.\nThe three ships were in the Whale Sanctuary where the controversial Japanese whaling fleet continue to hunt and kill hundreds of Minke whales, including the endangered Fin whales - for what Japan calls \"lethal scientific research.\" \nGreenpeace say they will now switch the focus of the campaign to shed light on the corporate entities behind the commercial whaling industry. Greenpeace New Zealand whales campaigner, Pia Mancia, said the two ships exposed the reality of the Japanese commercial whaling operation to the world. She said: \"it is now time to focus action on those controlling the whaling fleet.\"\nGreenpeace Southern Ocean Expedition Leader Shane Rattenbury said, \"Logistically we cannot remain in the Southern Ocean any longer, but this certainly isn't the last you'll hear of us... We now need the public to focus their attention on the corporates linked to the commercial whaling.\"\n\"For a month now we have dogged, delayed and disrupted the whaling fleet in the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary, and have no doubt that they have fallen far behind in their bid to slaughter 935 minke whales and 10 endangered fin whales. It is our hope that this struggle will inspire people to help us defend whales, so that it goes down in history as the last time the peaceful silence in the Sanctuary is broken by the sound of a grenade-tipped harpoon,\" Mr Rattenbury said.\nJapan has welcomed Greenpeace's decision to leave the Southern Ocean. Hideki Moronuki from Japan's Fisheries Agency is pleased the whaling mission will no longer be obstructed: \"Although Greenpeace say that they're activities are peaceful, their activities are really dangerous and illegal,\" he said. \nProtesters spent much of their time in the Southern Ocean in inflatable Zodiac boats, placing themselves precariously between harpoons and whales. They escaped serious injury when the Japanese allegedly rammed their vessel, and when a protester was pulled overboard by a harpoon rope. Activists were also blasted out of boats by water cannons.\nThe incidents caused slanging matches between Greenpeace and Japan's Institute of Cetacean Research, both arguing they had evidence the other was at fault. The Japanese say their whale cull is scientific research and that they will continue their whaling.\nGreenpeace Expedition Leader Shane Rattenbury has defended the risks taken by activists during the protests. \"We feel it's been a justifiable risk somebody had to come down here and do something, politics and diplomacy have failed.\" he said.\nJapan says it's too early to tell what effect Greenpeace has had on its current research mission. The Japan Whaling Association (JWA), which promotes and protects Japan's whaling culture says, \"The moratorium on commercial whaling is an anomaly.\" \nJapan's Institute of Cetacean Research (ICR) says the whale research programs are conducted in accordance with the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling. \nThe ICR say they \"do not, in any way, involve illegal whaling... under the IWC's \"no waste\" rules the by-products of the research program, including whale meat, are required \"so far as practicable to be processed\". It is this aspect of the program which is often inaccurately sensationalised as \"illegal commercial whaling\", reads a statement on their website.\nSea Shepherds head to Capetown.\nA second protest group - The Sea Shepherd Conservation Society - has also left the Southern Ocean. Their ship, the Farley Mowat is also headed for Cape Town. Captain Paul Watson said: \"Greenpeace and Sea Shepherd together have completed the most intensive and ambitious campaign ever mounted against Antarctic whaling activities. For 15 days, whales were prevented from being killed.\"\nCaptain Watson said he made the decision to stay in the Southern Oceans for as long as possible to continue to chase the \"illegal Japanese whaling fleet across the bottom of the world,\" he said. \"After a 4,000 kilometre chase, the Farley Mowat had reached its limit.\" \nThe Sea Shepherds had made arrangements to refuel from a tanker scheduled to supply a fishing fleet near the French Kergulen Islands. However, the South African company supplying the tanker cancelled the tanker rendezvous, citing extreme weather conditions.\n\"At that point, there was no choice,\" said Captain Watson. \"We were 2600 miles from the nearest port... We had to drop out of the chase and make for South Africa. We had no safety margin, in fact, we were short of fuel. The figures were ominous. Our chase suddenly became a race to survive.\"\nAfter fuel conservation measures paid off the Farley Mowat is expected to make it to Cape Town. \"We have just completed the longest voyage that this ship has made in its entire 48-year career,\" said 1st Officer Alex Cornelissen.\nWhilst the Sea Shepherds and Greenpeace were not officially working together, 1st Officer Alex Cornelissen of the Farley Mowat said, \"we believe we were working in cooperation with ...(Greenpeace). We had different roles, different tactics, and different strategies but the bottom line is that we were both opposing illegal whaling by Japan.\"\nThe Sea Shepherd Conservation Society says it will return to the Southern Ocean next year with a another, faster vessel to confront the Japanese whaling fleet. The Farley Mowat may also return to Antarctica as a secondary confrontation vessel.\nThe whale hunting season will continue until the middle of March. Greenpeace say they targeted this particular hunt because Japan had decided to double its quota of minke whales this year in the internationally recognised Southern Ocean whale sanctuary. \n\"This is supposed to be a whale sanctuary and the Japanese government is the only one in the world which is defying the ban on whaling here,\" Rattenbury said. \"Unfortunately so far we have seen 123 whales killed or brought back to the mother ship.\"\nThe Japanese Institute of Cetacean Research has a quota of 935 minke whales and 10 Fin whales. Fin whales are the second biggest animal on the planet, after the Blue whale. Greenpeace say they saw none killed during their actions. \"So far we have only seen minkes slaughtered, we have seen no fin whales being killed,\" Rattenbury said.\nThe Greenpeace ships are expected to arrive in Cape Town around February 5th. The Sea Shepherd ship Farley Mowat is expected to arrive in Cape Town on January 25th 2006."}

The sample suggests the virus might be more inclined to bind to human cells rather than animal cells, but there's no evidence that it's becoming more infectious. If we started to see a lot more samples from Turkey with this mutation and saw the virus changing, we'd be more concerned.\" \nHowever, the \"Nature\" report says there is a second mutation that also \"signals adaptation to humans.\" \nCheng also said that \"flu viruses mutate all the time. For us to assign public health significance to a genetic change we need to match it to what is happening epidemiologically \u2014 how the virus is behaving \u2014 and clinically \u2014 if it's more or less virulent.\"\nIn Turkey the fatality rate from the Bird Flu is 50% where elsewhere in the world reports of infection were only scattered. Entire families have been affected in Turkey and more reports come out almost every day of mild symptoms.\nSo far, Turkey has suffered four deaths and 21 infections. In addition to those cases the WHO reports 145 cases and 80 deaths in Cambodia, China, Indonesia, Thailand and Vietnam.\n\"When this outbreak (in Turkey) was first reported, there was a lot of concern it was behaving differently,\" said Cheng. Subsequent investigation, however, has indicated no major behavioral change. \n\"The team there told us that after two weeks of investigating, they haven't found substantial differences in the pattern we've seen in Southeast Asia,\" said Cheng.\nThe mutations were discovered by scientists in London, England in a lab.\nCheng said this may \"signify the virus is trying different things to see if it can more easily infect humans. So far, we haven't seen that the virus has the ability to do this. But it's important that we continue monitoring. We would be concerned if we were seeing successive generations of spread of the virus. We haven't so far. All these people had a very clear history of contact with diseased birds.\"\nHealth officials say that so far they do not see any evidence yet that the virus can spread easily in humans.\nThe Bird Flu virus, strain H5N1, first started to infect humans in 1997 in Hong Kong. In 2003 it re-emerged and it has so far been difficult to control."}

To accomplish this 30,000 jobs which make up 20 to 25 percent of Ford's North American workforce of 122,000 people will be cut and 14 plants will be closed in order to bring Ford's production capacity in line with demand.\nBy the end of this year, the Atlanta and St. Louis plants will be closed.

Any time a plant goes to one shift, it puts them in limbo. This car has made the company millions of dollars over the years they have invested in other products and locations - we are entitled to some new investment given our track record.\" \nPositive news for the plant is that Ford is still committed to invest $200 million into the plant to upgrade the appearance of the two cars manufactured there. On the contrary, according to Automotive analyst Dennis DesRosier believes that the factory is still \"likely\" to close. DesRoiser said, \"The St. Thomas plant is old, the product is old, it make sense it is on that list. This may be just a short-term reprieve, it may be look at permanent closure in two to three years.\"\nTwo more plants will close in 2008, another two in 2012. Two more plants to be closed are to be announced later this year. Also, Ford will fire 12% of its 53 executive officers.\nDue to the company's current contract with the United Auto Workers union, workers at the idled plants will still be receiving their pay and benefits until Ford negotiates a new contract with the union. However, the workers may not earn what they earn today because they will not be eligible for overtime.\nThe UAW President Ron Gettelfinger and Vice President Gerald Bantom called say the plan is \"extremely disappointing.\" The UAW issued statement saying \"The impacted hourly and salaried workers find themselves facing uncertain futures because of senior management's failure to halt Ford's sliding market share.

The network will be a 50-50 partnership between CBS and Warner Brothers. The network will be carried on stations owned by the Tribune Company, amongst others.\nThe merger is in response to the struggling of both networks, neither of which have attracted much viewership away from the big four networks since they being formed in the early 90s. However each have had some strengths. The WB has been more popular with younger viewers and has had hits with television shows \"Smallville\" and \"Gilmore Girls\". UPN has recently received critical acclaim for its sitcom \"Everybody Hates Chris\" and World Wrestling Entertainment's \"Smackdown!\" has been a mainstay since it debuted on the network. The new network's schedule will be announced in May; until then the networks will operate their schedules independently. The new network is planning to target the 18-34 age bracket in prime time, and will contain both shows from the WB and UPN.\nWith UPN's 12 affiliated station, together with Tribune's 16 stations gives the new network coverage over half of the country. The Tribune stations that will be apart of the new network is WGN in Chicago, WB flagship station, WPIX in New York and KTLA in Los Angeles. WPIX will become the flagship station of the new network.

Written by a retired U.S. Army officer and executive director of the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, Andrew Krepinevich, it was not publicly released. Upon inquiry, a copy was provided to the \"Associated Press.\"\nAs part of the conclusions reached in the Krepinevich report, it notes a drop in Army recruiting for the year 2005, a first since 1999, which came after the Army recently adopted policies of offering increased enlistment incentives. The report states that the Army is unable to maintain troop deployment to Iraq for a period adequate to disable the insurgency occurring there, and is faced with declining recruitment and re-enlistment rates. \nIn an Krepinevich interview , he said the Army remains an effective force and has plans to expand the number of available combat brigades for use in Iraq and Afghanistan. The conditions described by the report are listed as being triggered by simultaneous force restructuring, training requirements, and troop deployment requirements as well as the length of the engagement. Krepinevich also said in the interview that he believes the reason that Pentagon officials do not publicly state that the reduction in troop levels was prompted by stress on the Army; \"That gives too much encouragement to the enemy.\"\n, former NATO commander and retired four-star general in the US Army detailed his observations in an interview given on \"\" in December of 2005; \"Whether they're broken or not, I think I would say if we don't change the way we're doing business, they're in danger of being fractured and broken, and I would agree with that.\"\nDefense Secretary Donald H.

The journal also states the planet was found using a method called gravitational microlensing, which detects small planets with a mass like that of Earth.\nGravitational microlensing is where a light from a distant star is bent and magnified by the gravitational field of a foreground star. The presence of a planet around the foreground star causes light from the distant star to become momentarily brighter.\nHowever, scientists say that the cold temperatures on the planet make the chance of finding any life on it \"unlikely.\"\n\"We may predict with reasonable probability that microlensing will discover planets with masses like that of Earth at a similar distance from their stars and with comparable surface temperature,\" said study co-author Bohdan Paczynski from Princeton University.\nSo far the planet only goes by OGLE-2005-BLG-390Lb, and takes about ten years to orbit its parent star, a red dwarf, a star that is smaller and much cooler than our own Sun.\nScientists say the new planet, which is about five and a half times the mass of Earth, could either have a rocky core and a thin atmosphere, or be a small ice/gas world like Neptune, but in either case, its \"very large orbit and cooler parent star, makes it a very cold world.\"\nThe predicted surface temperature is -220\u00b0 Celsius (-364\u00b0 F), which means that should it have a rocky core, the planet may more closely resemble a massive version of Pluto with a surface of frozen liquids and gas. Otherwise the planet would be a liquid mass, wrapped in clouds of ice crystals and gas, much like Neptune.\n\"This is very exciting and important,\" said Professor Michael Bode from Liverpool John Moores University, a principal investigator for the RoboNet project which helped to collaborate on the research. \"This is the most Earth-like planet we have discovered to date, in terms of its mass and the distance from its parent star. Most of the other planets that have been discovered are either much more massive, much hotter or both.\"\nThis is the third planet in two years that scientists have found using gravitational microlensing.\nIn the past, more than 150 planets outside our solar system were found using a technique known as the radial velocity method. This method observes a wobble in stars caused by the planet's gravitational effects."}

Ismail Haniya, a senior Hamas leader, said they \"expected to win at least 70 seats.\"\nJust hours after the statement, and based on results that Hamas supplied from representatives at polling stations, Prime Minister, Ahmed Qurei of Fatah and his cabinet submitted their resignations. \"This is the choice of the people. It should be respected. If it's true, then the president should ask Hamas to form a new government,\" said Qurei. \"For me, personally, I sent my resignation.\"\nAlthough Qurei submitted his resignation, the party has not officially conceded defeat, but do acknowledge the claim ahead of official results.\nFatah has been in control of the Palestinian government for decades now, and on Wednesday, exit polls released after the polls closed, had shown that the Fatah party had a narrow lead in the elections.\nHowever preliminary results based on 95% of the votes cast give Hamas' Change and Reform Party 76 seats, leaving Fatah with 43 seats. The remaining 13 seats went to several minor parties and independents.\nTurnout was generally high, over 70% in all regions except Jerusalem, where turnout was less than 50%.

Elmar Brok, a senior member of the EU Parliament, said that the EU may cut off aid to the Palestinians if Hamas institutionalizes terrorism once it takes control of the government.\nBritish Prime Minister Tony Blair, speaking through a spokesman, stated that Britain \"can only do business with people who renounce terrorism.\"\nItalian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi was quoted as saying \"It is a very, very, very bad result.\"\nHowever, media and government outlets throughout the Middle East such as Iran and Lebanon, who consider Hamas to be in a defence struggle, praised the result of the elections. \"The Palestinian people faithfully chose the option of resistance and are to fully support it,\" said Iran's Foreign Ministry Spokesman Hamid-Reza Asefi.

In its September 30, 2005 issue, the paper printed 12 drawings of the Muslim prophet Muhammed, as a response to previous news reports that the publisher of a forthcoming childrens' book about the prophet had had difficulty in finding an illustrator, due to fear of extremist reactions; drawings of the prophet are prohibited by Islamic Law (see aniconism). In an attempt to start a debate over freedom of speech in Denmark, the newspaper printed 12 drawings of the prophet. Four of these were of a satirical nature, with one showing the prophet with a turban hiding a lit bomb.\nThe immediate reactions to the publication of the drawings included ambassadors from 12 Muslim countries demanding that the Danish Prime Minister, Anders Fogh Rasmussen, denounce the newspaper. Rasmussen rejected this demand, stating that \"Danish freedom of speech does not allow the government to control what newspapers print\". He further noted that the only possible legal action against the newspaper would be one under the charge of blasphemy.\nA debate ensued over the following months about freedom of speech and its value in relation to avoiding religious taboos. In mid-December 2005, a delegation from several Danish Muslim organizations went on a tour in several Middle-Eastern and Arabic countries, reportedly to gain sympathy for their point of view. Several reports state that during the tour the difficulties faced by Muslims in Denmark were grossly overstated."}

The clean-up is expected to take up to a week and cost more than AU$3 million.\nThe spill occurred in Gladstone Harbour on the central Queensland coast, late on Tuesday night, after 25,000 litres of heavy fuel poured from a coal carrier. The accident happened when a tug rammed into a Korean coal carrier, rupturing its fuel tank. \nSeveral government agencies and four skimmer vessels were called in after the \"Tom Tough\" struck the Korean-owned, Panamanian-registered bulk coal carrier \"Global Peace\" - puncturing its fuel tank as it was about to berth.\n\"It'll just annihilate the stocks plus everything up and down the food chain in relation to what the different fishermen catch,\" local fishing spokesman Warwick Sheldon said. \"It's right in the middle of the commercial banana prawn fishing season at the moment \u2013 this has the potential to just wipe out their stocks.\"\nQueensland Premier Peter Beattie said an investigation was under way to determine whether anyone would be prosecuted. \"There will be no cost to the taxpayer because of the law,\" he said. The clean-up costs will be met by the ship's owners in accordance with international maritime law.\nThe Wildlife Protection Association of Australia (WPAA) says the spill inside the harbour occurred in the worst place possible. \"It's probably the worst place that we could ever have a spill because it's inside the harbour,\" said WPAA president Pat O'Brien. \"It's an area where there's a whole range of animals there that'll be affected by it. There's dugongs and porpoises and animals like that, that breathe air, that come to the surface regularly. Turtles again too, they'll finish up with oil all over them.\"\nIt is the worst oil spill in Queensland since the Oceanic Grandeur ran aground in the Torres Strait in 1970 and the second spill in Gladstone's Harbour within a week. About a tonne of oil spilled in the harbour last week.\nA marine investigator from the Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) is investigating the incident. Investigation leader Peter Foley says the type of oil involved has added to problem. \"It's certainly more difficult to control than perhaps crude oil because it tends to be around the same specific gravity or same density as sea water,\" he said."}

The West Papuans were flown to Christmas Island on an RAAF Hercules last week.\nTwo of the group, a man and his child, have now been flown the 2,600 kilometres to Perth, Western Australia from the remote Indian Ocean island. Air force personnel had initially refused to fly them, concerned that the flight crew's health would be at risk.\n\"It's a complete farce, absurd\" said one health official. \"It has not only posed an unnecessary health risk, it has been hideously expensive.\" \nThe West Papuans were among a group of 43 refugees found last week on the far north-west coast of Cape York in Queensland. They had made a five-day journey from the Indonesian province in an outrigger canoe. They arrived with banners accusing Indonesia's military in the province ruled by Jakarta of genocide and intimidation. Their 25m traditional boat was fitted with an outboard motor and was flying the outlawed West Papuan flag. \nAmid media scrutiny and the disapproval of the Indonesian government, the boat people underwent health checks before being sent to Christmas Island. X-rays and other medical examinations strongly indicated that at least one man had tuberculosis, yet the group were flown to Australia's Christmas Island Immigration Detention Centre. \nUpon landing at the Island, health officials recommended the patients be transferred to Perth. However, the crew of the RAAF Hercules refused to take them, saying they were not \"adequately equipped\".\nA Department of Immigration spokesman (DIMIA) said an alternative flight was arranged. \"At this stage there has been no positive diagnosis for tuberculosis,\" the spokesman said.\nThe removal of the asylum seekers to Christmas Island has been met with fierce criticism from many refugee rights groups and opposition parties, who say it was impractical, potentially traumatising and hugely expensive. The Immigration Department says it has interviewed most of the asylum seekers but won't say if they have made formal asylum claims.\nCriticism.\nRallies in Sydney, Melbourne, Darwin, Canberra and Brisbane were held this week, in support of the West Papuan asylum seekers. Refugee rights advocates protested the forced transfer to the remote Christmas Island facility. \nMelbourne auxiliary bishop Hilton Deakin told about 130 people demonstrating outside DIMIA headquarters in Melbourne that, \"we know that already the Indonesian authorities, in Canberra and beyond, are trying to get to them.\"\nYet the he Indonesian embassy in Canberra denied making any approach, saying: \"I can guarantee that there has been no contact whatsoever, it hadn't been requested, it was never even sought.\"\nBut the Immigration Department has confirmed that \"a junior delegation\" from the embassy went to Weipa last Thursday seeking access to the asylum seekers. A spokesman for the Immigration Department said the Indonesians arrived in Weipa on Thursday but by then the Papuans had already been put on a plane for Christmas Island. The West Papuans were told they had a right to Indonesian consular assistance if they choose. \"Not one has chosen to do so,\" the spokesman said.\n\"The majority of these 43 people are leaders for free expression and self-determination and possible independence because of the oppression from which they suffer,\" Bishop Deakin said. \"Massacres, rapes and all the rest of it have gone on in that country for almost 30 years.\"\nHe called on the Australian Government to cancel its training program with the Indonesian military.\nDemocrats leader Lyn Allison said the Australian Government had \"got it wrong on this issue\". The 43 asylum seekers had been \"whisked off\" before they could tell their story, she said.\nGreens Senator Kerry Nettle has called on the government to grant access to Papuan asylum seekers. The senator says they should not be in detention and they certainly should be allowed to communicate with the outside world. \nSenator Nettle will go to Christmas Island this weekend to meet the imprisoned West Papuans. She said the immigration department is obligated under the Migration Act to allow her to meet them.\nNew Zealand Support.\nMeanwhile New Zealand Greens have offered to take the asylum seekers. \"New Zealand can show the Howard government how to be compassionate, as we did back in 2001 when we took some Afghan asylum seekers from the Tampa,\" the New Zealand Green Party Foreign Affairs Spokesperson Keith Locke says.\n\"It is shocking that the West Papuan refugees, having survived 450 kilometres of open water in a flimsy craft, are now bundled off to a Christmas Island detention camp - well out of range of those Australians who wish to help them,\" he said. \n\"Under refugee law these Papuans deserve special consideration, having come directly from their claimed country of persecution, Indonesia, not via a third country, as is the case with most asylum seekers in this part of the world.\n\"The Papuans certain have a good prima facie case. I know from my own visit to West Papua last April that there is substantial and ongoing harassment of the local people, particularly those who assert their right to political self-determination,\" said Mr Locke. \nOn Friday last week Indonesian security forces shot dead one Papuan protester, and wounded two others, in the Paniai district, where the 43 asylum seekers originate."}

January 26th (Australia Day) is Australia's official national day - commemorating the landing of the First Fleet in Sydney Cove in 1788.\nWhile the rest of the country celebrated the Australia Day holiday with medals, barbecues, fireworks and beer under the Union Jack and Southern Cross, hundreds of people at the Aboriginal Tent Embassy in Canberra lit a ceremonial fire and discussed the land that once belonged to their ancestors. \nIndigeneous Elders have gathered this week at the Aboriginal Tent Embassy for the Corroboree for Sovereignty convergence, in response to what they say is the continual Government threat to control the historical Tent Embassy site.\nThe gathering identified the 34-year-old Tent Embassy on the grounds of Old Parliament House in Canberra, as a significant place of social, spiritual and political importance to Aboriginal Peoples - a symbol of the assertion of Aboriginal Sovereignty. The Aboriginal Embassy, not considered an official embassy by the Australian government, has come under review recently in a bid to remove the campsite and dwellings originally founded on Australia Day in 1972.\nThe Tent Embassy calls on all Aboriginal Sovereign Nations to \"stand up against the illegal occupation of our country and continue to resist the oppression of our people.\" The Tent Embassy say that \"until there is true justice for our people, these issues will not go away and we will continue to resist.\"\nMembers of the Embassy will take a sacred fire to Melbourne in March for the 2006 \"Stolenwealth Games\" campaign, in an effort to highlight the plight of Aboriginal people. The fire will contain a \"message of peace, healing and justice, and create a focal point for unfinished business.\"\nThe group calls on all Aboriginal Nations to send representatives to the Embassy to commemorate and review the issues of Land Rights in Australia. The Tent Embassy also announced the establishment of the National Tribal Law Council.\nThe High Court of Australia has on a number of occasions rejected any actual legal notion of Aboriginal sovereignty.\n\"Invasion Day\".\nIndigenous leaders, including Marji Thorpe, Gary Foley, Robbie Thorpe and Michael Mansell claim that Native Title and Reconciliation haven't adequately addressed Indigenous rights. They say: \"Native Title has mainly embroiled Indigenous peoples in complex legal processes where they have (generally unsuccessfully) had to prove their fundamental human rights to the land.\"\nThe campaigners, known as the Black GST, say the process \"puts the onus on Indigenous peoples to somehow prove continuous connection with their land, an impossible task in many situations given the effects of our dispossession and attempted genocide.\"\nOn Australia Day the diverse and vibrant group marched peacefully through Canberra, gathered at the Embassy on the lawns in front of Old Parliament House and called for recognition of indigenous sovereignty over the land.\n\"We're wanting to let all the people know that all the land in Australia has been given back to the Aboriginal people... and the sovereignty now lies with all Aboriginal nations,\" a spokesperson Robert Corowa said at the Embassy. \nTo many Indigenous and Non-Indigenous people, Australia Day is labelled \"Invasion Day\" - in recognition of the colonisation of the continent by the British, he said. \"We call it invasion day. The most important thing is that everybody in Australia who's now living here... we strongly encourage them to come to the Aboriginal Tent Embassy and place a leaf in our fire.\"\nLegal director of the Tasmanian Aboriginal Centre (TAC), Michael Mansell, says the current Australia Day celebrations should be scrapped and a new national day chosen. Mansell said Australia Day would forever remain a racist blot on Australia's political landscape as long as the event was held on the anniversary of the landing of the First Fleet.\n\"There can never be reconciliation between whites and Aborigines so long as the anniversary of the coming of white people is the basis for celebrating Australia Day,\" he said. \"A fair and just society cannot be built on celebrating gains by one race at the expense of another.\"\nMr Mansell has also reported the theft of an Aboriginal sign from the TAC premises. The sign reading: \"AUSTRALIA DAY Yes, let\u2019s celebrate: MURDER, INVASION, RAPE, THEFT\" was removed on the 25th of January hours after being installed on the Launceston premises.\nMansell says that he will replace the sign in an effort to \"the obvious need to expose the myth, as expressed in the national anthem, that Australia is a free and fair country\" and called for \"white society\" to punish the offenders.\n\"This is another instance of the continuing trend in Tasmania of racist attacks on both people and property by extreme elements of white society who don't like the truth, who don't like Aborigines and other races. As with the racial attacks on middle Eastern people in Sydney, these Tasmanian incidents show how Australia under the Howard government is becoming more openly xenophobic,\" he said.\nFlag Burning.\nActivists in Brisbane yesterday burned an Australian flag to protest against celebrations marking European settlement in Australia. Around 300 protesters staged an \"Invasion Day\" demonstration. Queensland Premier Peter Beattie condemned the action.\n\"I don't care whether they're black or white ... I don't believe we should burn the Australian flag, particularly at this time (when) we all know we live in an unsettled world,\" he said. \nOne protester said he believed the wrong flag had been burned: \"I just felt deep down that it should have been the British flag they burnt not the Australian one.\"\nCompulsory National Anthem.\nThe Tasmanian Aboriginal Centre has strongly opposed the compulsory singing of the Australian national anthem in schools. \nNSW Premier Morris Iemma wants to make it compulsory for NSW schoolchildren to sing the national anthem each day before class. The plan has strong support from both sides of Parliament in Tasmania as well as the Multicultural Council of Australia and the Australian National Flag Association.\nHowever some Aboriginal support groups say forcing the singing of the national anthem diminishes individual enthusiasm for participation. \nMichael Mansell says, \"more importantly, the anthem is about the white people and immigrants and excludes Aborigines.\" He said the words \"for we are young and free\" were a clear reference to the last 200 years of colonisation by Europeans and dismissed the ownership of the country by Aboriginal people.

Insulin has been used for the treatment of diabetes for many years now, but some patients find it difficult (and costly) to use as it has to be injected into the body, usually several times a day. Currently, about five million Americans take insulin injections. Also, the use of any form of insulin can cause blood sugar to drop below safe levels, a condition called hypoglycemia. As a result, the use of insulin must be accompanied by a careful and regular monitoring of blood sugar levels.\nThe FDA has issued guidelines that the inhalable form should not be used by smokers, patients with asthma, bronchitis, or emphysema as tests have shown that its use can reduce the breathing capacity of the lungs. Other side effects associated with Exubera therapy seen in clinical trials included cough, shortness of breath, sore throat, and dry mouth.

It's the collateral damage theory of propaganda,\" said the director of the National Security Archive at George Washington University, Thomas Blanton.\nThe role of PSYOP, according to the document itself, is an effort by the military to \"convey selected information and indicators to foreign audiences to influence the emotions, motives, objective reasoning, and ultimately the behavior of foreign governments, organizations, groups, and individuals.\"\nPentagon spokesman Lawrence Di Rita said the Pentagon was not comfortable with propaganda \"bleeding back\" from overseas to the United States. \"We're not OK with it,\" Di Rita said. \"First of all, we're not lying. We're talking about truthful, accurate information, so that's baloney.\" Di Rita said.\nThe document said that \"psyops,\" are restricted by policy and executive order from targeting US audiences, US military personnel and news agencies and outlets. \"However, information intended for foreign audiences, including public diplomacy and PSYOP, increasingly is consumed by our domestic audience and vice-versa.\"\n\"Information Operations Roadmap\" said in part: \"The increasing ability of people in most parts of the globe to access international information sources makes targeting particular audiences more difficult. Today the distinction between foreign and domestic audiences becomes more a question of USG (U.S. government) intent rather than information dissemination practices.\" \nInformation used in psychological operations \"will often be replayed by the news media for much larger audiences, including the American public...The likelihood that PSYOP messages will be replayed to a much broader audience, including the American public, requires specific boundaries be established,\" the document stated."}

The (SAMSA) have placed a guard on the gangplank and are patrolling the ship. \nThe Farley Mowat, which sailed from Melbourne, Australia on December 6, was detained in Cape Town harbour, following a request from the Canadian government. A SAMSA official said the ship did not have the required certification.\n\"They don't have the right certificates for the skipper, the first-mate or the chief engineer,\" an official said. According to SAMSA, the detention adheres to Canadian maritime laws and followed correspondence from Canada, who requested that the authorities check the ship. \nAccording to Scoop Independent, the ship and crew have been detained due to the International Maritime Organization's ISPS Code. Under Canadian maritime law, both the captain and first officer should be Canadian nationals. Captain Paul Watson is Canadian, First Officer Alex Cornelissen is Dutch. \nSAMSA claims that the Farley Mowat was \"not in possession of an international ship security certificate or a ship security plan\". \nThis means the ship allegedly does not comply with the (ISPS Code) \u2014 a comprehensive set of measures to enhance the security of ships and port facilities. The code was developed in response to the perceived maritime threats to ships and port facilities in the wake of the 9/11 attacks in the United States.\nThe official said the detention was in line with Canadian maritime laws and followed correspondence from Canada requesting the authorities check the ship.\nHowever, Captain Paul Watson says political pressure from Japan is behind the detention of the boat. He says he does not have the necessary documentation required by officials as the boat is registered as a yacht and not a commercial vessel.\nConfrontation on the High Seas.\n are currently in the Antarctic catching whales for the Japanese Institute of Cetacean Research (ICR)'s JARPA II lethal research program - a practice condemned internationally by anti-whaling nations. After samples have been taken, the remaining whale meat is sold as a delicacy. \nDuring the last six weeks in Antarctica, the Farley Mowat has intercepted the Japanese whaling fleet, chasing the whalers over 4,000 miles. Sea Shepherd say the whalers spent 15 days running from them, and that \"no whales were killed as the fleet attempted to put as much distance between the whalers and whale defenders as possible.\" \nDuring one confrontation the Farley Mowat crew claim it sideswiped the Japanese whaling fleet supply vessel Oriental Bluebird and ordered it to leave from the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary.\nSea Shepherd Conservation Society say they will return to Antarctica in December 2006 with a faster long-range vessel. \"We discovered that when we can catch them, we could stop their whaling activities. If we can secure a faster ship we will be able to shut them down completely. We will be making every effort to secure a faster ship so that we can return and intervene more effectively against their illegal killing operations,\" said Captain Paul Watson.\nInstitute of Cetacean Research in Tokyo councilor Dan Goodman say that Australia, New Zealand, and other anti-whaling nations should support Japan's commitment to its scientific research. \nJapan announced at last year's meeting of the International Whaling Commission (IWC) this summer its JARPA II program that includes the killing of 935 and 10 endangered .\nIn 2007-08, Japan will raise its self-imposed kill quotas to include 935 Minke whales, 50 fin whales, and 50 . Mr. Goodman said Japan had to kill the whales because certain kinds of data \u2013 including how old whale populations are, how old whales are when they reach sexual maturity, how long whales live for, and what they eat \u2013 cannot be obtained using non-lethal methods.\n\"These are the kinds of data required to improve management measures for the resumption of commercial whaling,\" Mr. Goodman said. \"Of course the anti-whaling scientists don't believe this kind of data is required because they do not want to see a resumption of commercial whaling.\"\nDr Gales, head of Australia's delegation to the scientific committee for the IWC, said after years of research the Japanese should have concluded by now that piked (minke) whales eat krill. \"They're asking for support for science that has no support,\" he said.\nNext year, Sea Shepherd Conservation Society say they intend to return to the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary in Antarctica to do some research of their own; \"We need to research more effective law enforcement measures to shut down this criminal operation that is posing as a research project,\" said Captain Watson."}

The centre is currently home to just two Iraqi asylum seekers who were found to be refugees, but refused protection by Australian Immigration after receiving an adverse security assessment from the Australian security agency, ASIO.\nImmigration officials say the Nauru camps are being maintained in a state of readiness, complete with dozens of staff, in case they are needed for future asylum-seekers. The \"million dollar a month\" figure is more than six times the official estimate given after the last big group of asylum seekers left the island late last year.\nThe group of 25 asylum seekers were accepted by Australia after nearly five years detained on the island. The decision to release the group followed a September visit to Nauru by former immigration minister John Hodges with mental-health experts, who said that \"the precarious mental health of many of the detainees required urgent attention.\" The delegates said some men were being constantly monitored for suicide risk or self-harm.\nThe last two asylum seekers on Nauru say they are hitting rock bottom - after their friends were granted refugee and humanitarian visas. Both men say they are beyond the point of despair, insisting that they cannot understand why they received adverse security assessments. \n\"Sometimes I feel that we are a piece of rubbish that everyone is trying to get rid of,\" Mohammed Sagar told Melbourne's Age newspaper. \"We feel we are caught in the middle of a situation. It is too much to bear,\" said Mr Sagar, who insists neither he nor Mohammad Faisal are security risks. \n\"We strongly reject the finding and we believe it is unfair and unjustified. I have not said or done anything to cause harm in any way to an individual, let alone a whole country.\"\nMr Sagar said there was no longer an interpreter at the facility and this accentuated the men's problems. The pair are also concerned that they will lose other support, including access to a psychiatrist, when responsibility for the centre shifts from the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) to Australian and Nauru authorities in March.\n\"I feel I am very alone on this very tiny piece of land in the middle of the sea,\" Mohammed Sagar, 29, said in November. Mohammad Faisal, 25, said: \"My only option now is just to keep going with medication and sit alone inside my room and cry.\"\nAccusations.\nFaisal and Sagar say they had been been accused of not being co-operative in interviews with an ASIO officer in January, a charge they emphatically denied. \"I am wondering why those officers didn't mention earlier that I haven't been co-operative,\" wrote Sagar. \"Why they waited four months to tell me this. I feel it is a psychological war. And they waited all this time just to put me under mental pressure.\"\nThey had reportedly made \"anti-Western\" and \"anti-Australian\" comments during an interview with ASIO officers. \n\"I've never expected that I would some day get such an accusation thrown on me, because it's terrible,\" said Mr Sagar. \"I have never been in a police station, for a small fight even. How come to be a security threat for a whole country? It's terrible. I can't imagine it, even. I'm living in limbo. To think there is a possibility, even 1 per cent, to get a rejection, makes me feel very, very bad,\" he said.\nMr Faisal says he has a problem with his eyes which he believes could be treated in Australia. \"I am enduring all this just to get freedom and be treated as a human being. If I didn't have a problem, I would go back (to Iraq) and would not endure this terrible situation here. I don't want human rights to be given to me. I want animal rights.\"\nMillion-dollar-a-month.\nThis week a DIMIA spokesman said \"preliminary estimates\" of the cost of maintaining the Nauru facilities in a contingency state were \"around $1 million a month\". The spokesman said the cost of maintaining the centre was not affected by the presence of the two men. \nAustralian Democrats Senator Andrew Bartlett said the cost was absurd. He said it was crucial that the two men on Nauru not be forgotten: \"They can't just be left in limbo.\"\nCritics say there are no grounds for maintaining the facility, bearing in mind the Christmas Island immigration facility with a capacity for over 200 people \u2014 and is currently building a AUD300 million 800-bed centre there.\nThe Howard government has negotiated with Nauru and Papua New Guinea for the detention camps to remain in operation, and has indicated that it will re-activate the two camps if people smuggling resumes. Prime Minister John Howard hails the use of offshore detention as an \"outstanding success\" \nAppeal.\nSenator Bartlett said the pair should be allowed to appeal against the findings to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, like those who received adverse security clearances on Australian soil. \"It's obviously not tenable to keep two people stuck on an island in the middle of the Pacific on their own,\" he said. Labor immigration spokesman Tony Burke said: \"Nauru should be shut down. It's a waste of money, and it's appalling to leave these two languishing.\"\nAn Immigration Department spokesman said officials were working closely with the Nauruan Government \"to find a resolution to the situation\".\nMr Sagar said he had suffered from depression and frustration over the past four years, but it was much harder now. \"We had friends we could talk to to pass the time,\" he said. \"Now I feel as if time has stopped.\" He expressed gratitude to Australians who had written letters of support. \nAmong those expressing concern is Mohammad al-Zirjawi, who was freed in August said, \"they will go crazy in the camp alone.\" Mr Zirjawi suffers from depression, but says he is trying to make a fresh start.\nRefugee advocate Marion Le says the ordeal has been a shockingly long period of detention for those on Nauru. She said, \"it's been in my opinion an unmitigated disaster.\"\nThe Immigration Department said in November that the Government was working to resolve the cases of the two final Nauru asylum seekers."}

The IP address which made these edits has an extensive editing history on Wikipedia, and has been repeatedly blocked in past months for article vandalism and violation of Wikipedia policies (Wikipedia's log of 143.231.249.141 being blocked from editing).\nWikipedia administrators, alerted to the Marty Meehan article edits, realized that many edits to politically-sensitive articles had been made from IP addresses assigned to the US Capitol building, and have begun an investigation into all edits from such addresses.\nEditing history.\nEditing from U.S. House computers.\nAt the center of the investigation are edits by the IP address 143.231.249.141, which is the proxy through which most of the U.S. House Internet traffic passes. Jon Brandt, spokesman for the Committee on House Administration confirmed House ownership of the IP . An aide for Rep. Meehan made two edits to the article on Meehan's biography. The first was on July 18, 2005 and replaced the article with his official biography, which was biased towards Meehan. A later edit on December 27, 2005 removed text referring to Mr. Meehan's pledge to only run four terms, or 8 years.\nThe text that was removed said \"He also ran on a platform of term limits. However, after serving four terms as US Congressman, the number of terms he pledged that he and no other congressman should serve out, he has since gone back on his word and now is adamently [sic] against the idea of term limits for Congressmen.\" \nThe text was replaced with: \"His fiscally responsible voting record since then has earned him praise from citizen watchdog groups.\"\nCongressman Meehan has served seven terms as Representative of his home state of Massachusetts.\nMost of the edits from Capitol Hill IPs have not been harmful edits. Many edits have been made which were neutral, correcting factual, spelling, grammar, and punctuation errors. A sampling of both positive and harmful edits to politically-related articles are included here. \nThe communications director for Rep. Joe Wilson took a different approach to editing Rep. Wilson's article. She contacted Wikipedia founder Jimbo Wales, who advised that she supply a biography on the Wikipedia article's discussion page, rather than edit the article directly, for other Wikipedia editors to check and to incorporate into the article itself. After she added the official bio to Wilson's discussion page, Wikipedia editors used it and several other sources to expand the article substantially.\nFurther investigation.\nFollowing the reports of the edits from the House IP address, a so-called \"checkuser\" (a check of confidential information to determine the accounts used by staffers coming from that IP) was performed to determine what users logged-in with an account edited from the House IP address, and the edits made by all of those users were checked as well. They all showed little bias and no vandalism. \nEditing from Senate computers.\nUnlike the U.S. House, computers from the U.S. Senate are assigned individual IP addresses. To identify possible vandals, the edit history for all senators was checked, and a list of 25 addresses was extracted. While some had good faith edits, others showed unacceptable behaviour.\nThe entire 156.33.x.x netblock is for Senate use only \nSenator pages edited.\nThe following is a partial list of U.S. Senator biographies on the English-language Wikipedia edited by Senate employees.\nEdits categorized by IP.\nWhile the identity of these IPs are not known, a small sample of edits from Capitol IPs shows both helpful and harmful edits.\nA complete list of all the Senatorial IPs that contributed to political articles can be found here.\nWikimedia Foundation and Wikipedia response.\nThe attention of Wikipedia administrators was drawn to the pattern of edits to Wikipedia articles by Congressional staffers at 18:47 on January 29. In response, Wikipedia administrators began a systematic examination of all edits to articles made from IP addresses that have been assigned for use by the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives.\nAdministrators found several places where edits from U.S. Senate IP addresses had been to articles on Senators.\nFollowing online discussions using IRC, Wikipedia administrator FireFox blocked the U.S. House of Representatives' Wikipedia editing privileges for one week while the issue is discussed. The block was lifted shortly thereafter by a dissenting admin. \nWhile the Wikimedia Foundation has not yet issued a statement regarding this, Jimmy Wales was quoted by the AP discouraging the removal of facts. \"You don't delete it,\" Wales said. \"If they wanted to put in their side of things, that would seem ethically relevant, rather than just omitting it.\""}

He is a medical cannabis patient who relies on the drug to regulate the symptoms of malignant phenochromocytoma, a cancer of the adrenal gland which can cause the level of adrenaline in his system to fluctuate out of control. If left unregulated, this can result in sudden, fatal heart attack, stroke, pneumonia, and a variety of other conditions.\nKubby was arrested on arrival at San Francisco International Airport Thursday night on behalf of the Placer County Sheriff's Department, having exhausted his extradition appeals in Canada. He was taken to San Mateo County Jail, pending transport to Placer County Jail. While at San Mateo County Jail, he was reportedly denied access to medication and sufficient bedding. On arrival at Placer County Jail, his blood pressure was dangerously high, and so was given Marinol, a THC synthetic.\nCommunication with Kubby is highly restricted. According to his wife, Michele, Kubby has been placed in solitary confinement, denied access several times to sufficient bedding to keep him warm, and denied access to the cannabis which, according to several experts on his universally fatal condition, has been solely responsible for keeping him alive for decades. The Marinol he is being given partially mitigates his symptoms, but does not completely control them. He now grows dangerously ill.\nIn particular, he relates how he was ordered by prison medical staff to take beta-blockers for his blood-pressure. Due to the episodic nature of the adrenaline spikes causing the high blood-pressure, according to all of his doctors, the beta-blockers would likely kill him once the spikes dropped. In an interview by phone with journalist Pat McCartney over the weekend, Kubby reported that, for refusing the beta-blockers, he was coerced into signing a waiver absolving the prison of liability, and has since been refused all care, including even Tylenol for pain management. \nActivists concerned with medical marijuana, human rights and prison reform will hold a rally at noon today in front of the Placer County Superior Courthouse, where Steve Kubby is scheduled to be arraigned on violation of probation charges.\nKubby was a co-author of California's Compassionate Use Act of 1996, also known as Proposition 215. He fled to Canada in 2001 to escape the possibility of incarceration for an extended period without access to cannabis, a possibility which, in both his and expert medical opinion, would certainly prove fatal.

Rob Wesley-Smith from \"Australians for a Free West Papua\" said the asylum seekers escaped because their lives were threatened, and would certainly face death if forced to return. \nIndonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono has assured Mr Howard that the group will not be prosecuted if they are returned.\nThe West Papuan asylum seekers are currently being detained in an Australian Immigration Detention Centre on the remote Christmas Island, 2,600 kilometres off Perth, Western Australia. The group claims genocide at the hands of the Indonesian Government.\nThe Federal government flew the 36 adults and seven children to Christmas Island, where the families were put into immigration department housing and the single men in the detention centre.\nRob Wesley-Smith says the asylum seekers should be dealt with according to Australian law. \n\"The people have escaped... because their lives are at risk,\" he said. \"Their fathers have been killed, one of them was in jail for a number of years himself, and this is the reality of the situation in West Papua - so no way should they go back - they'd be killed.\"\nSupporters of the \"West Papuan 43\" say that the West Papuans \"are entitled to the support of community groups and their fellow country people. They should also have easy access to translators, medical care and independent legal assistance.\"\nThe Indonesia Human Rights Committee has called on the Government to plea for the immediate release of the asylum seekers into the Australian community, and for their claims to be processed fairly and as expeditiously as possible.\nImmigration Minister Senator Amanda Vanstone said it was not always possible to keep women and children out of detention.\nThe New Zealand Green Party has called for some of the asylum seekers to be processed in New Zealand.\nCase for asylum.\nMr Wesley-Smith says they have legitimate claims for refugee status. \"There's evidence that some have been mistreated and tortured and they're a cohesive group and strongly politically motivated, and that there is no way that they would be seen as a group to be sent back - that that's just a preliminary assessment,\" he said.\nThe 43 asylum seekers told of graphic, disturbing accounts of beatings and torture by Indonesian military, during interviews with Immigration officers over the past week.\nAccording to The Melbourne Age newspaper, an Immigration source said the refugees had a \"very strong case\" for refugee status. \"Some of what has come out of the interviews has been absolutely heart-wrenching,\" the source said. The group described accounts of vicious bashings while in prison and attacks on villages and livestock in retaliation for the Papuans agitating for independence. \nDespite human rights organisations and academic reports, detailing thousands of deaths and even \"genocide\", Indonesia says \"abuses no longer occur in West Papua.\" \nUnder the control of the Indonesian military an estimated 100,000 West Papuans have lost their lives over the last four decades. Two days after the West Papuan refugees arrived in Australia, Indonesian troops opened fire in the Paniai district, killing a 13-year-old and wounding two others.\nWest Papuan leaders and academics say that the indigenous people may be wiped out because of new threats such as an HIV/Aids epidemic and the unchecked environmental devastation caused the exploitation of forestry and mineral resources.\nAustralian government responses.\nThe Australian government have yet to make a decision on the asylum seekers, the general affairs counsellor of the Australian Embassy said in Jakarta.\n\"There is no decision yet, not at all,\" Elizabeth O'Neill said. She said verification and interviews by Australian authorities were \"standard procedure\" and valid for anybody arriving in the country without official documents. The process, she said, was in line with United Nations Conventions and Australian laws.\nShe said the two governments have had good relations since the Bali bombing in October 2002 and the tsunami in December 2004. Reports in Jakarta media say John Howard has given assurance to Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono that the handling of the West Papuan group, who's territory is under Indonesian authority, would not disturb the relation between the two countries.\n\"Prime Minister Howard has even reiterated his support that Papua is part of the Indonesian sovereignty, and promised to have close communication both at the high level, ministerial and official levels to handle the case without disturbing our relation,\" said a spokesman.\nA Department of Immigration spokesman said lawyers were currently interviewing the West Papuans on Christmas Island about their asylum claims.\nBackground: Australia's Pacific Solution.\nThe Papuans' boat was only the third boat of asylum seekers to arrive on the mainland since 2001. Asylum seekers who arrive by boat are sent to remote detention centres for processing, in what the Howard Government calls the Pacific Solution.\nAustralia's borders are protected by mandatory detention legislation. The Australian government detains all persons entering the country by boat without a valid visa, including children. Since the late 1990\u2019s unathorised arrivals have been transferred to one of the Australian immigration detention facilities on the Australian mainland, or to Manus Island, Nauru or Christmas Island as part of the Pacific Solution. Mandatory detention remains a very controversial aspect of Australian immigration policy.\nA High Court decision in 2005 means that detention can also be indefinite - the Court ruled that the government had the right to keep a Palestinian asylum seeker in detention, even without any prospect of release.\nGreens senator Kerry Nettle visited Christmas Island at the weekend and talked with some of the Papuans. She called on the Government to move the group to the Australian mainland, where there is an established West Papuan community. "}

Jesse Jackson, who in 1968 broke the news of King's death to Coretta, described her as a \"freedom fighter\". \"She walked with her husband during the ordeal of the Montgomery Bus Boycott. Their home was bombed, she endured the hate and violent anger toward their family. And she had to endure the constant knowledge that each time he left their home, he might never return,\" said Jackson. \"She was the part of him that made him complete.\"\nIn 1969 she founded the Martin Luther King Jr. Center for Nonviolent Social Change in Atlanta and used it to confront hunger, unemployment, voting rights and racism. \"The centre enables us to go out and struggle against the evils in our society,\" she often said.\nShe also accused movie and TV companies, video arcades, gun manufacturers and toy makers of promoting violence. Coretta King has became a symbol in her own right of her husband's struggle for peace and brotherhood. \nIn his State of the Union Address, US President George W Bush remembered Mrs King, saying her \"lasting contributions to freedom and equality have made America a better and more compassionate nation.\"\nMrs. King is survived by her four children, Yolanda, Martin III, Dexter and Bernice. The family issued a statement thanking the public for an outpouring of support.\nSources.\n "}

Um Qasr is an Iraqi port in the southern Basra province where British troops operate.\nThe Ministry of Defence has yet to name the soldier, a member of the 7th Armoured Brigade who are better known as \"the Desert Rats\". They stated that the blast, which also injured three other soldiers, took place at around 8.30 a.m.\nSympathy has been widely expressed by various political and social figures. An official spokesman for British Prime Minister Tony Blair, who ordered the country's troops into Iraq, said that he was \"deeply saddened\" by the death, as he is by all fatalities of service personnel. Dr Liam Fox, the opposition Conservatives defence spokesman, also expressed his sympathies.\nCritics of the war also expressed their sympathies but blamed the government for the soldiers' death. Reg Keys, father of a military policemen who died in an ambush in Iraq, said that \"We have had 100 chances to learn our lesson. It just goes on and on.\" George Galloway, the Respect MP for Bethnal Green and Bow said \"Our hearts go out to the family of the hundredth British soldier to die in Iraq. These one hundred deaths are the all too predictable consequences of the illegal and immoral war in Iraq. I don't want another British soldier to die occupying other people's countries.\" Respect echoed the call by the Stop the War Coalition for a demonstration in Parliament Square were the names of the all dead will be read aloud.\nHowever, Conservative foreign secretary Sir Malcolm Rifkind, who originally opposed the war, claimed that Britain could not just leave Iraq.\nAmong countries that sent soldiers to Iraq, the UK ranks second in number of casualties, above Italy with 27 and Ukraine with 18, but is well below the US's figure of 2242. The number of Iraqi military casualties is agreed to be larger than this, but may lie anywhere between 5000 and 45,000 according to different sources.\nThe number of Iraqi civilian casualties from March 2003 to September 2004 is estimated as 100,000 (excluding the Fallujah attack), with most of the violent deaths due to air strikes."}

The treatment is not expected to pose a threat to non-molluscan aquatic wildlife, vegetation, or land-dwelling creatures at the site. Officials expect the one-time treatment process will provide protection from the possibility of future infestation for 33 years.\nThe entire body of water will be treated with potassium chloride to a level of 90 ppm, well below the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s (EPA) standard of 250 ppm for potable water. There are no expected health risks for humans, or contamination of drinking water wells in the immediate vicinity.\nThe freshwater Zebra Mussel species is a threat to native mussels of the region because of their high reproduction rate and their ability to attach themselves in clusters to native mussels, which kills them since they are prevented from opening and closing their shells to feed or burrow. Bottom-dwelling marine species are often covered by the Zebra Mussel.\nMeasures to prevent the spread of zebra mussels vary by region where the species is present. In Maryland, boat owners who launch water craft on reservoirs that serve as sources of drinking water are required to register their boat for use only on those reservoirs, to reduce chances of the mussel being transferred from other waters. Drinking water treatment and power production facilities where the mussels are present must regularly treat their systems to keep them clear of decaying debris that fouls intake pipes.\nZebra mussels were first discovered in North America in 1988, in Lake Saint Clair, a lake between Lake Erie and Lake Huron. By 1990 they appeared in all of the Great Lakes. It is believed that the mussels were accidentally brought over from Europe on the hulls of ships."}

Currently his position is being filled on an interim basis by Deputy Prime Minister Ehud Olmert.\nSharon, who had been Prime Minister of the State of Israel since 2001, suffered a massive stroke on January 4 during the run up to a new series of Israeli parliamentary elections.

Australia also pledges $150 million in aid for the reconstruction of Afghanistan. \n\"We have 190 at the moment, special forces, we've got another 110 going there to provide additional support for them with two helicopters, and this would be another 200 on top of that.\" Mr Downer said.\nSpeaking outside a two-day international donors conference in London, Mr Downer said Australia's commitment to Afghanistan was not as large as some countries, but it would nevertheless make a big difference.\nHe said Australia would build on the millions it has already spent in Afghanistan, with a new pledge of $150 million over 5 years through aid agency AusAID. Canberra has spent 110 million dollars in the war-torn country since the coalition invaded in late 2001.\nMr Downer joined world leaders in London for the signing of the Afghanistan Compact: \"a road-map for international donors and the Government of Afghanistan to work together to rebuild the country into a stable and democratic state.\"\nAustralia's latest troop commitment, for a provincial reconstruction team in conjunction with the Netherlands, will take its total in Afghanistan to 500 troops. Downer said that the troops would probably be sent to take part in a proposed provincial reconstruction team with Dutch soldiers in the southern province of Uruzgan as early as July.\n\"July, August would be the pencilled-in planning at the moment, so that would involve Australia sending around 200 troops over and above the troops we already have in Afghanistan,\" he said. \nMr Downer said Afghanistan still had a security problem but things were going in the right direction.\n\"We know how important it is for the new democratic government in Afghanistan and the new free and democratic processes there to survive, and every country that possibly can needs to give support to Afghanistan,\" he said.\nUnder the compact, Afghanistan has pledged to meet targets in security, governance, rule of law and human rights, and economic and social development in return for military and financial aid from its international partners.\nAustralia also has about 900 troops in Iraq. About 450 of the soldiers are guarding Japanese forces in southern Samawa, which Japanese media reports said could end by May.\nDowner said Australia would \"wait and see\" what Japan would do before deciding whether to bring its Samawa troops home or redeploy them elsewhere in Iraq. \nAustralia has already committed some 300 troops and support personnel to Afghanistan."}

A Newspoll in The Australian newspaper found that 31 per cent of voters were opposed to the ID card.\nAustralian Prime Minister John Howard refloated the possibility of an \"Australia Card\" after the July 7 London suicide bombings. British Prime Minister Tony Blair's government is considering introducing cards identifying Britons by fingerprints and iris scans. \nAustralia last debated a national ID card (to cut down on tax avoidance), the \"Australia Card\", in 1987, but was defeated in the Senate after public outrage. Mr Howard, then in opposition, opposed the card, but now says times have changed. \"This is an issue that ought to be back on the table...in the wake of something like the terrible tragedy in London,\" Howard told a news conference in June last year. \nAustralia has been on medium terror alert since 2001. While there hasn't been a major terrorist attack on Australian soil, Prime Minister John Howard says it's a \"possibility.\" \nMr Ruddock is expected to announce this week the terms of an independent inquiry into an ID card, citing national security and fraud prevention as key concerns. The inquiry will investigate the possible benefits of such a card in combating terrorism and fraud, and whether it could be introduced at a reasonable cost.\nOpposition public accountability spokesman Kelvin Thomson said he was unsure whether it would help Australia's fight against terrorism as there was no great evidence to suggest ID cards assisted those countries that already had them. \nAustralian Privacy Foundation chief Anna Johnston said the poll was good news for those who opposed the ID card. She said the lower level of support for the ID card compared with 1986 showed that people were better informed.\n\"I would suggest that this shows the Government is already on very shaky ground on this proposal if there is only this very small majority of people in favour of it,\" Ms Johnston said. \"Because as more details emerge about what is actually being put forward, support will drop.\"\nAttorney-General Philip Ruddock, said that policy should not be dictated by public opinion. \nAdvocacy groups say that work had already started on creating a coalition of lobby groups in readiness for a campaign. \"We're starting to marshall our resources now,\" Ms Johnston said. \"Like the Australia Card debate, we are looking to establish a broad coalition of people across the political spectrum and from all walks of life.\"\nRuddock's comments have been slammed by security experts, who say national ID cards do not make Australia any safer and could have the opposite effect. \nJames Turner, security analyst at Frost &amp; Sullivan Australia, said: \"ID cards cannot protect us from terrorism because an ID card cannot indicate intention. It's like signature based anti-virus, the AV signature can only point out the currently known viruses; and an ID card can only identify currently known baddies.\"\nJo Stewart-Rattray, director of information security at Vectra Corporation said: \"As far as its goal being to protect us from terrorist attacks, I don't think so. The bad guys will always find a way to propagate their own version of these cards. It is not protecting us against terrorist attacks by any means.\"\nStewart-Rattray's comments echoed those of ex-MI5 chief Dame Stella Rimington, who recently said ID cards were \"useless\" at fighting terrorism. \"If we have ID cards at vast expense and people can go into a back room and forge them they are going to be absolutely useless. ID cards may be helpful in all kinds of things but I don't think they are necessarily going to make us any safer,\" said Rimington.\nBruce Schneier argued that ID cards will not help improve security and would have the opposite effect. He says the card will require an \"immense database\" with \"enormous\" security risks.\n\"The security risks are enormous. Such a database would be a kludge of existing databases; databases that are incompatible, full of erroneous data, and unreliable. As computer scientists, we do not know how to keep a database of this magnitude secure, whether from outside hackers or the thousands of insiders authorised to access it,\" wrote Schneier.\nRoger Clarke, of the Australian Privacy Foundation asked whether the \"billions it would cost would be worth it\", especially considering the \"enormous intrusions into the affairs of the majority of law-abiding citizens\".\nAccording to Privacy International, around 100 countries have compulsory identity cards. They also stated that \"virtually no common law country has a card\"."}

Eric May, as he warned of a possible nuclear attack that might occur in the Texas City or Houston metro area. Capt. Eric May also mentioned that a likely target could be the British Petroleum plant in Texas City, Texas.\nLocal citizens have also noticed ongoing SWAT exercises involving numerous government agencies in the area, including Homeland Security, the HPD and the Pasadena Police Department.\n\"After leaving the Texas City police station, I noticed one thing really strange, as I counted at least 11 different types of official police and government vehicles parked in the police lot. I have never seen this before and it has me a little worried. What are they planning?\" said local resident John Watkins.\nBesides this increased activity in the Houston area, there have been reports that the Bank of America has been in contact with Homeland Security officials discussing the topic of how to deal with customers in the case of a pending \"national disaster.\" Employees of the bank have been ordered to remain silent, as ones from all levels have been told of the proper procedures to take. Employees in both Houston and LA have disclosed they were recently told not to distribute certain things from safety deposit boxes in the event of a national emergency, including gold, silver and firearms. They were, however, allowed to hand out important papers to asking customers.\nIt seems as if British Petroleum may also be conducting nuclear disaster exercises in the Houston area, as an email from an alleged BP employee has surfaced on the internet. Although his identity has not been proven as of yet, he states that he holds the position of a \"building monitor\" and has never had any responsibilities before. However, on Friday, January 27th, he was called into a meeting and told that he had best get his men ready for some disaster drills to be starting in the next week.\nThe US government is also running a nuclear disaster drill in the Charleston, SC area from January 31st to February 2nd. The organizers said that nuclear drills should not frighten citizens, but should instead encourage them to learn how to protect themselves in the event of an attack. It should be noted that the government has run other nuclear disaster tests before, including one last summer called \"Sudden Respond '05.\" Therefore, this increase of disaster drills may just indicate that the government is taking the threat of a nuclear attack seriously and not necessarily that there is one impending."}

At least one of those puppies will be trained to sniff for drugs.\nAbout 24 kilograms of heroin was seized in recent raids in Colombia which have resulted in more than 20 arrests and another ten in custody in New York.

The government is undertaking a complete rewrite of such laws in response to concerns voiced by some health professionals about the link between the drug and mental health issues. The proposed legislation will also increase jail sentences for those convicted of growing cannabis . \n\"There is growing evidence of a link between long-term cannabis use and the incidence of severe mental health problems,\" said Mr Iemma. \nUnder the plan the current cannabis cautioning system, introduced in 2000, is to be reviewed. Cannabis users would be required to attend counseling to \"understand the link between cannabis use and mental illness\" to avoid being charged for their first offence. At present those issued with their second cautioning notice are required to call a counseling service. \nRevised Penalty System.\nCurrent penalties do not distinguish between hydroponic cultivation and other forms of cultivation. The new set of penalties proposed by Mr Iemma include:\nHydroponic cultivation.\nThose found hydroponically growing cannabis will be hit particularly hard by the new laws. Mr Iemma defended the government's proposals by referring to expert advice on the effects of this type of cannabis on users. \"Regular cannabis use can exacerbate mental illnesses and associated criminal activity. Experts tell us that potent, hydroponically grown cannabis is a particular problem,\" he said.\nThe content of in cannabis changed sharply in the 1970s with the rediscovery and spread of the technique, wherein the material used by the unfertilized female plant to create seeds is diverted to the production of trichromes, which contain THC. Potency rates have risen slowly but steadily since then with the refinement of various cultivation techniques. These techniques also have resulted in much greater yields. \nThe concentration of THC in cannabis as related to genetics, correct nutrient supply and may be controlled by , however these conditions are also regularly met using soil-based growing techniques. \nUnder the new laws hydroponic cannabis houses will be subjected to the same search and warrant powers as those which are used for the manufacture of amphetamines and heroin. \nSupport and Concerns.\nDr John Currie from Drug and Alcohol Services at Sydney's Westmead hospital supports the government's position, telling ABC \"there is growing evidence that the long term use of cannabis can cause mental illness, whether you're predisposed to it or not\". \n\"Equally as worrying for us is that just ordinary people who don't have a mental health problem can still get trouble when they do have long term use of cannabis\" said Dr Currie. \nThe Prime Minister has also accused cannabis of playing a role in Australia's mental health problems. \"I think we are paying a dreadfully heavy price for the abuse of what was so called recreation and socially acceptable drugs despite the clear evidence, unaccepted until a few years ago, that these things were doing massive damage within our community,\" Mr Howard has said in parliament.\nMr Howard signaled that he supported the move in New South Wales to increase penalties for cannabis, especially hydroponic cannabis which the NSW government claims is stronger. \"I welcome the change in direction of many of the states,\" he said.\nThe Mental Health Council of Australia has warned the government of over-estimating the role of cannabis in mental health. John Mendozza, the Councils Chief Executive, told ABC \"I don't think we should overstate the role of cannabis in the nation's mental health crisis. It is a factor, but it is not the reason that we now face a mental health crisis.\"\nThe government's claims are based in part upon an Australian study conducted in 2002, which found regular use of cannabis among teen-age girls to be predictive of later anxiety and depression, though not that among boys. A different study published in 2005 actually found that those who suffer with depression and use cannabis \"for medical reasons\" reported less depressed moods. \nResearch has shown that cannabis use is risky for adolescents with an abnormal gene (which occurs in about 25 percent of the population of Northern European descent). Compared to the rest of the population, those with the abnormal gene and who smoke cannabis regularly during adolescence have an increased risk of developing later in life, though none of these factors separately predicts the illness. \nOpposition and Concerns.\nOn the other hand, New South Wales' government proposals has been met with stiff opposition from various factions, including parts of the medical community. Doctor Alex Wodak, of the Australia Drug Law Reform Association in an interview with said \"I think many people, not just me, see this as more motivated by concern about the March 2007 elections than any public health measure.\"\n\"If governments were really serious about cannabis and in favour of draconian responses for a drug which after all, doesn't cause any deaths, then what would they do about a drug that causes 19,000 deaths in Australia a year - namely tobacco?\" asked Dr Wodak. \nThe NSW laws contrast with calls from the in South Australia for a relaxation of anti-cannabis laws. State leader Sandra Kanck said, \"politicians and media commentators are getting on the bandwagon, saying we need to recriminalise the personal use of marijuana. That would make around 476,000 South Australians - 40 per cent of the population - retrospective criminals. About 75,000 people in the state would break the law each week if marijuana was criminalised. We need to recognise that drugs are used, and have appropriate policies to deal with that. Prohibition didn't work in America in the 1920s and it won't work now\". \nAnti-Cannabis laws in other Australian jurisdictions.\nSouth Australia, Western Australia and the Australian Capital Territory already distinguish between cannabis which is grown hydroponically or using artificial light and conventional cannabis for possession offences.\nSouth Australia also goes one step further by having separate penalties for cannabis possession in public and in private. In South Australia possession of up to 20 cannabis plants for personal use is punishable by a $500 fine.\nWhen compared to other jurisdictions the Australian Capital Territory has the lightest penalties for cannabis offences. Penalties for cannabis possession range from $100 for possessing 25 grams of leaf or 2 or less \"non-artificially cultivated\" plants to a $5,000 fine and/or 2 years gaol for possessing an amount of cannabis not covered by the above.\nThe Northern Territory has some of the toughest anti-drug laws in Australia when contrasted with other states. A person can receive a 25 year gaol sentence for having more than 20 plants in their possession.\nCannabis policy directions in other Western countries.\nThe NSW government's decision to introduce tougher penalties for cannabis cultivation and possession comes at a time when other Western countries are relaxing their laws in this regard.\nIn the United States, anti-cannabis laws vary greatly from state to state with respect to personal use, medical cannabis and cultivation. Cannabis is still broadly prohibited under the federal , and the federal government selectively enforces the law so as to frustrate various forms of legalization at state and local levels, for example in \"\". \nPersonal cannabis use in the Netherlands is subject to a of official tolerance, though it remains technically illegal. The Netherlands regulates the sale of cannabis in , though the non-tolerance of cultivation above five personal plants creates an irregularity of supply (the so-called \"back-door problem\"). Legislation is under consideration to address this by regulating commercial cultivation. The current Protestant government has sought to limit the number of coffee shops, and in border towns bar sales to foreigners. \nCertain provinces of Canada have adopted a policy of non-enforcement of anti-cannabis laws against personal use, to the point that in the Vancouver and Toronto areas, operation of cannabis caf\u00e9s is tolerated, though they are not permitted to sell. Cultivation is still aggressively interdicted. The city of Vancouver has drafted a licensing model similar to the Netherlands, which has not yet gone into force. The recent have brought a minority Conservative government, which may bring reversals in liberalization of cannabis laws. \nIn the United Kingdom cannabis has been as a Class C drug, making it less likely for an individual to be arrested for possession.

A controversial conscience vote on the issue to overturn laws which prohibit Australian women's access to the drug, will be held in Federal parliament on February 9.\nThe Senate committee is considering a bill to remove ministerial control of the abortifacient drug Mifepristone - or RU486. Health Minister Tony Abbott says the issue of whether to allow women access to the drug \"is one of principle.\" Abbott, who is against abortion, insists he is the right person to control the drug's use in Australia.\nBesides its use internationally as an \"abortion pill\", there may also be a small chance that it may help treat various other medical disorders including prostate cancer, breast cancer, and inoperable brain tumours amongst other conditions. Mifepristone is effectively banned in Australia, with Minister Abbott controlling whether it is made available. \nThe bill, sponsored by a group of female senators and MPs, would hand Mr Abbott's powers over to the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) - the body that controls all other pharmaceutical drugs in Australia. The bill seeks to have the TGA determine the drug's availability and not the Health Minister.\nDemocrats Leader Lyn Allison, said she was \"cautiously confident\" the parliament will overturn the current arrangements when the conscience vote takes place. \"Those who are in favour of the bill are saying this is a choice that ought to be available to women and that on the basis of the studies that have been done overseas it is at least as safe as surgical termination,\" Senator Allison said.\nReproductive Choice Australia (RCA)say that medicine is placed at the whim of politics, saying that over 80% of Australians are pro-choice. A national survey found 87% of women aged 18 to 49 support a woman\u2019s right to choose.\nRU486 is available in much of western Europe and North America, but was effectively banned in Australia under laws initiated by now-retired pro-life senator Brian Harradine.\nChristine Read, medical director of family planning group FPA Health, said Misoprostol, also known as Cytotec, is across the world to invoke contractions to expel the fetus after a woman had taken RU486. \"It is used extensively in obstetrics and gynaecology for termination of pregnancy and to induce labour, so it's used in the medical management of miscarriage,\" Dr Read said.\nDr Sharman Stone, said yesterday the issue was not about Misoprostol, but rather that \"the TGA should make the decision about any drugs - that is its job. Any other conversations about other drugs are simply irrelevant to this argument,\" Dr Stone said.\nFamily First senator Steve Fielding says lifting a ban on RU486 would pave the way for do-it-yourself home abortions. \"RU486 is different to other drugs in that it is an abortion drug which could see do-it-yourself home abortions,\" he said in a statement. \"The question is, should policy be made by bureaucrats or our elected leaders?\nSenator Fielding claims Australians are worried about the high number of abortions in Australia, as reflected in submissions received by the Senate committee.\nOn Monday the committee will move to Sydney for a final day of hearings.

The images ranged from serious to comical in nature; a particularly controversial cartoon portrays Mohammad with a bomb wrapped in his turban. The Jutland-based newspaper states that the images were meant to inspire some level of public debate over the image of Islam in Europe, and had no direct aim of offending anyone.\nHowever, many Muslims follow the doctrine of aniconism concerning the portrayal of Mohammad. This tenet of Islam states that the Prophet Mohammad should not be depicted in any type of art, regardless of the intent of the piece. This belief, along with the potentially insensitive nature of some of the caricatures, have caused offense to many Muslims in the Arab world.\nIn the past month, the controversy over these cartoons escalated. The cartoons were re-published last month in Spain, Italy, Germany, France and the Netherlands (where the latter two nations have large Muslim populations), and have begun to re-circulate throughout the Middle East. \nMany Danish companies have been targeted for boycotts. As \"Wikinews\" reported last week, Arla Foods, Denmark's top dairy company, has seen their sales fall to zero in some Middle East nations. Carrefour, a French retail chain, has pulled all Danish products from its shelves in the region. Earlier this week, protests were held throughout the region, including the Gaza Strip in Jerusalem, where Hamas supporters led an assault and protest that surrounded the European Union offices for Israel.\nHamas members, some armed with guns, stormed the EU office (which is primarily staffed by Arabs) and demanded apologies from EU member states, saying they would otherwise face serious consequences. \"It will be a suitable reaction, and it won't be predictable,\" said Abu Hafss, a member of the Al Quds Brigade (an affiliate of the group Islamic Jihad), in a press conference outside the EU offices. And the Abu al-Reesh Brigades, a group related to the late Yassir Arafat's Fatah party, warned that EU member states had 10 hours to apologize for the cartoons or their citizens would be \"in danger\".\nJamila Al Shanty, a newly elected Hamas legislator, stated that more rallies will be planned in protest of the cartoons. \"We are angry - very, very, very angry,\" Al Shanty said today, adding that \"No one can say a bad word about our prophet.\"\nThe Iranian newspaper Hamshari daily has stated that on February 8 it will publish anti-semitic cartoons in response to the Danish cartoons, apparently failing to notice that Denmark has only a tiny Jewish population, since most escaped to Sweden during the World War II Holocaust. The newspaper says that the cartoons will lampoon the Holocaust despite denials by the Iranian government that the Holocaust even happened.\n\"Jyllands-Posten\", the newspaper that first published the cartoons did issue an apology to Arab countries on Monday, shortly after the EU office incident. But with the support of the government of Denmark, the newspaper had earlier defended its actions fiercely, citing the universal right to free press, and its duty to serve democratic traditions by inspiring debate. Indeed, Anders Fogh Rasmussen, Prime Minister of Denmark, said \"We are talking about an issue with fundamental significance to how democracies work.\" In fact, some European pundits have placed more fault on Muslims for refusing to \"accept Western standards of free speech and pluralism\". When the cartoons were originally published in 2005 they were intended to highlight and redress the unequal restrictions applied to Islamic content in European newspapers in comparison with content referring to other religions. The cartoons are also self-referential, with one character in the cartoons writing in Arabic on a blackboard \"Jyllands-Posten's journalists are a bunch of reactionary provocateurs\", and another cartoon showing a cartoonist having to work in hiding because one of the cartoons he is drawing includes an image of the Prophet Mohammad. The text around the cartoons stated:\nHowever, some world leaders have elected to help defuse what could be a major social crisis in Europe and the Middle East. France's foreign minister Philippe Douste-Blazy said that freedom of the press should be exercised \"in the spirit of tolerance\", sentiments which were echoed by United Nations General Secretary Kofi Annan. Ursula Plassnik, foreign minister of Austria, said that the European community must \"clearly condemn\" acts which insult religion. And Hamid Karzai, president of Afghanistan, warned Europe that \"any insult to the Holy Prophet (Peace Be Upon Him) is an insult to more than one billion Muslims and an act like this must never be allowed to be repeated.\" \nRasmussen, in an interview with Arabic TV Al arabia, said that \"...Danish government condemns any expression and any action which offends people's religious feelings...\" and also said that he does not understand why, as the cartoons were originally published in September, the situation has only truly started to deteriorate in the past week.\nIn Denmark, there are counter-demonstrations by moderate Muslims saying they don't want the images banned. Munira Mirza commented that many Muslims \"want to be able to say: 'Hey we're not children, we can handle criticism, we don't need special protection - we're equal'. Many don't want to be treated as a special group, seen as worthy of more protection from criticism than other groups because of their apparent victim status.\"\nReligious satirist Stewart Lee commented that \"Jyllands-Posten\" had \"tried to deal with a subject they don't know enough about, and this is one of the teething problems of the cross-over of cultures in the world. I'm sure the level of offence is far greater than would have been intended.\"\nIn France.\nThe director (Directeur de publication) of \"France Soir\", a French national newspaper was fired in response for publishing a cartoon titled: \"Yes, we have the right to (joke about) characterise God\" (Oui, on a le droit de caricaturer Dieu). The \"France-Soir\" web site is presently offline. The cartoon is partially visible on a nouvelobs.com website. \nToday, Lib\u00e9ration, another French national newspaper, is publishing two of the \"Mohammad Cartoons\". Other newspapers across France are asking for their rights to freedom of the press to be defended.\nCharlie Hebdo, a well-known satirical newspaper, will publish articles to support cartoonists, freedom of speech and freedom of the press.\nThe general reaction in France seems to be that most citizens except religious people (Catholics, Muslims...) are astounded by the level of anger against the \"Mohammad Cartoons\".\nIn Australia.\nOn February 9 2006 Queensland Premier Peter Beattie gave The Courier Mail Newspaper his blessings in publishing the Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons/depictions of Muhammad stating that he is a firm believer in free speech and ones freedom of expression.\nOn the very same day he got his legal representative to write to the author of this site photoduck.com demanding he censor material relating to him and his Government.\nOnline.\nAlthough many newspapers have not republished the cartoons in order to avoid backlashes, the drawings have appeared on the Internet and are being revealed at a number of Web sites and blogs. On January 30th, Fox News contributor Michelle Malkin placed the drawings on her blog, and encouraged others to do the same. "}

They were later taken to an immigration detention facility on Christmas Island, a remote Australian territory in the Indian Ocean.\nA spokesman for the group says they fear they will be killed if returned to Indonesian-controlled Papua, where a pro-independence movement has been operating since the 1960s.\nJakarta's ambassador warned of strained relations if they are granted asylum. Indonesia's ambassador, Teuku Mohammad Hamzah Thayeb, said the group had nothing to fear from Indonesian authorities. Asked if granting asylum to the group would strain Australia/Indonesia relations, Thayeb said: \"I would hope it will not, but it certainly would have an effect. That's why we have to manage this together and find a solution.\" President has also guaranteed the group's safety should they return.\nQueensland National Senator , who met with the 43 refugees on Christmas Island, said they appear to have a genuine asylum claim and had been persecuted because of their Christian beliefs. \"There are documented cases of members within their families being shot,\" he said. \"There's certainly on the record experiences of them being jailed and tortured so I think they would be under risk if they went back,\" he said.\nThe group, which includes seven children, arrived carrying a banner accusing Indonesia of terrorism and genocide in the province. Indonesian troops have been repeatedly accused of rights abuses in Papua province, which was taken over by Jakarta in 1963. Over 100,000 Papuans, one-sixth of the population, have died in military operations. \nImmigration Minister said, \"if they ask for protection we will consider the claim appropriately and if it is appropriate to offer it, we will offer it.\" \nThe leader of the asylum seekers, Herman Wainggai, says the Indonesian military treat indigenous Papuans \"like animals\". Mr Thayeb disagreed: \"We have changed fundamentally within ourselves,\" he said. \nIndonesia offered Papua special autonomy in 2001 in an effort to quell unrest from the Melanesian population in the resource-rich area. Mr Wainggai described the Papuan autonomy as a \"sham\", and said there have been many reports of the Indonesian military \"murdering and raping people, and destroying villages since autonomy came into force.\"\nPapua controversially became an Indonesia province after a vote in 1969 overseen by the United Nations called the . The Act of Free Choice was drafted by the UN and gave every adult the right to vote on the issue of independence. However, only 1022 people hand-picked by the Indonesian authorities were allowed to vote. Reinforcing the dubious nature of the poll, the voters gave 100 per cent approval to become part of Indonesia.\nIndonesia's ambassador said there was no reason for the West Papuans to seek asylum as they were not criminals. \nThe Australian Greens said the Indonesian ambassador's assurances that West Papuan asylum seekers would be safe if they returned home should not be believed.\n\"The new Indonesian Ambassador's assurances about the safety of West Papuan refugees if they are returned to Indonesia are not credible,\" Senator Nettle said. \"The escalating repression of the independence movement and generalised suppression of the people of West Papua is well documented.\" \n\"The Australian government should not give in to Indonesian pressure,\" Senator Nettle said.\nSenator Joyce said the group of native West Papuans were Christian, which meant they are ethnically, religiously and politically isolated after an influx of Indonesians to the province."}

Blair is reportedly quoted as responding that he is \"solidly with the president and ready to do whatever it took to disarm Saddam\".\nThe memo from the sources also states that Bush suggested \"flying U2 reconnaissance aircraft planes with fighter cover over Iraq, painted in UN colours\", so that \"if Saddam fired on them, he would be in breach [of UN resolutions]\".\nAccording to the memo, President Bush said he \"thought it unlikely that there would be internecine warfare between the different religious and ethnic groups\".\nThe British government did not deny the existence of the memo last night, but insisted that \"the prime minister only committed UK forces to Iraq after securing the approval of the House of Commons in a vote on March 18, 2003.\" It added that they \"do not comment on the prime minister's conversations with other leaders.\"\nThe BBC reported that Chief spokesman for the National Security Council Frederick Jones said that \"the White House would not comment on what was said or not said in alleged private conversations between Mr Bush and foreign leaders,\" and added that the White House \"was not going to re-litigate how the nation went to war\". \nThe purported document has not been confirmed as authentic by either government so far."}

In a new effort to fight the disease, the Stop Tuberculosis Partnership on January 27 requested US$31 billion for a Global Plan to Stop Tuberculosis, which the Partnership claims would prevent an estimated 14 million TB deaths during the next ten years.\nTo kick-off the funding drive, Bill Gates pledged to donate US$600 million. \"Every 15 seconds somebody dies of TB, avoidably, preventably,\" said UK Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown, who helped launch the Plan at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. \"I welcome the Gates Foundation's announcement today. For far too long, world leaders have ignored the global tuberculosis epidemic, even as it causes millions of needless deaths each year,\" said Brown.\n\"The Global Plan is fundamental for Africa, where tuberculosis was declared an emergency by 46 countries in 2005,\" said Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo.\nTuberculosis is a contagious disease caused by bacteria that spread through the air and usually attack the lungs. One-third of the world's population is now infected, and 5-10% of infected people suffer active TB disease sometime during their lives. Left untreated, each person with active TB will infect on average between ten and 15 people every year. \nTB is active worldwide, though most deaths are in Southeast Asia and Africa. \nDrugs in use for more than four decades can cure the disease. The World Bank ranked a common TB-treatment strategy, called DOTS, as one of the \"most cost-effective of all health interventions\". \nA childhood vaccine against tuberculosis has been available for more than 75 years.\n\"This is a disease with a huge impact that is completely treatable and preventable,\" said Dr. Peter Small, a member of the Stop TB coordinating board. \"It's not that we can't do something about it, it's that we've chosen not to.\"\nIn addition to limited funding, the fight against TB has also been hampered in recent years by two developments. Because HIV weakens the immune system, people who have the virus that causes AIDS are much more likely to become ill with tuberculosis than those who are HIV-negative. TB is the leading cause of death among people with HIV/AIDS.\nThe second problem lately has been the evolution of drug resistance among many strains of the bacteria that cause tuberculosis. Some strains, called multi-drug resistant, are immune to the effects of more than one drug.\nStop TB claims that full funding of the Plan will help achieve the Millennium Development Goal to have \"halted by 2015 and begun to reverse the incidence of tuberculosis.\" The Plan aims to provide:\n\"We have a unique historic opportunity to stop tuberculosis,\" said Dr. Marcos Espinal, Executive Secretary of the Stop Tuberculosis Partnership. \"The challenge now is for people to work together in putting the plan into action, in order to stop one of the oldest and most lethal diseases known to humanity. This plan tells the world exactly what we need to do in order to defeat this global killer.\"\nThere has already been significant progress against TB over the past several years. Since 2000, estimated spending on tuberculosis control in the 22 hardest-hit countries has increased from US$800 million to US$1.2 billion; as a result, the number of patients receiving TB treatment in these countries more than doubled.\nAccording to Stop TB, implementing the new Plan will require US$56 billion over ten years--US$47 billion for expanding access to treatments already available, and US$9 billion for research and development of new diagnostic tools, drugs, and vaccines. The total number is US$31 billion more than the amount Stop TB estimates will be spent if current funding trends continue. The investment, the group insists, would have a profound effect on the number of tuberculosis cases averted and lives saved."}

Some of the cartoons were also broadcast on Television New Zealand's current affairs programme \"Close Up\" yesterday.\nIn September 2005, the Danish newspaper Jyllands-Posten first published the cartoons. The images range from serious to comical in nature; a particularly controversial cartoon portrays Mohammad with a bomb wrapped in his turban.\nThe Dominion Post editor Tim Pankhurst says the decision today to publish the cartoons was in defense of press freedom and it is important for readers to make up their own minds.\n\"We do not wish to be deliberately provocative but neither should we allow ourselves to be intimidated...If we allow Christianity and more particularly the Catholic Church and the Pope to be satirised, and we do, should Islam be treated differently?\" \nJaved Khan, President of the New Zealand Federation of Islamic Associations, says he hopes it will not affect New Zealand's trade, but believes there could be \"serious repercussions\". \"We won't call for a boycott, and we don't want to see one, but news gets around the world pretty quickly. Muslims will make their own decisions and as you know, they've taken drastic action against Denmark\". He also said the government should take a stand against the cartoons.\nEthnic Affairs Minister Chris Carter has criticised the newspapers for publishing the cartoons, saying that it undermines New Zealand's reputation as a tolerant country. Prime Minister Helen Clark has condemned the actions of the newspapers and TVNZ, saying that the publishing of the cartoons was gratuitous and she could not see the point of it. She said that the issue was one of judgment, not freedom of speech, and she thought that neither publishing the cartoons nor the reaction to it will do anything to bring communities and faiths together.\nBoth co-leaders of the M\u0101ori Party have spoken out strongly against the decision to publish the cartoons. \"It's one thing to promote freedom of the press and freedom of expression, but quite another to use those rights to justify the decision to insult religions and beliefs,\" said co-leader Pita Sharples. \nIn contrast, cartoonist Tom Scott said that the Islamic community needed to get a sense of humour. \"[They] clearly have god on their side so they don't need cartoonists as well,\" he added. Scott faced a blasphemy prosecution in 1969 over an anti-Christian cartoon.\nSome Muslim religious leaders have called for boycotts against countries that have published the cartoons, and many Danish companies have been targeted. Arla Foods, Denmark's top dairy company, has seen their sales fall to zero in some Middle East nations.\nNew Zealand's Fonterra Co-operative Group, the world's fifth largest dairy company, has run advertisements saying that the milk in its products do not come from Denmark.\nNew Zealand's embassies in the Middle East have been placed on high alert.\nUpdate, February 5, 2006: Hundreds of people have marched down Auckland's Queen St to protest the publication of the cartoons. The march was organised by the Pakistan Association of New Zealand to let the public know about the hurt that Muslims have felt."}

Hong Kong's Health Secretary said in a media conference on Friday that positive tests for H5N1 in a bird brought into Hong Kong from China indicates that the virus is endemic in the region. \nDr York Chow says new laws will be introduced to restrict movement of poultry. \"It's not just Hong Kong, he said. \"This virus will exist in neighboring areas, southern China as well as Hong Kong,\" Dr Chow said. \"Since different kinds of wild birds and chickens have this virus, we can be quite sure that this virus is endemic in our birds,\" he said.\nHealth bureau spokeswoman Sally Kong later clarified Dr Chow's comments, saying the Secretary meant that bird flu was endemic in Asia - but not in Hong Kong specifically. Whilst Bird flu is considered endemic in Vietnam, Indonesia, Laos, Cambodia and Thailand, international standards require that countries be certified as 'endemic' by test results showing a cycle of disease recurrence in an area. Mrs Kong said Hong Kong does not meet such standards. \nYork Chow said the government intends to ban individual households from raising chickens, ducks, geese, pigeons, turkeys and quails. The legislation to ban private ownership could be in place next week. Current Hong Kong legislation allows private poultry ownership of up to 20 birds. Under the law change, the current exemption will be removed. The unauthorised keeping of poultry will be an offence warranting fines of up to $100,000, however, those keeping commercial racing pigeons in new towns and villages may be exempt.\nDr Chow encouraged the surrender of backyard poultry to the Agriculture, Fisheries &amp; Conservation Department. Those who want to keep birds before the new legislation comes into effect must have them vaccinated against avian flu. The Government may set a date for the central slaughtering, Dr Chow said.\nPermanent Secretary for Health, Welfare &amp; Food, Carrie Yau, stated that the risk of a bird flu outbreak still exists even if chickens are vaccinated - as the virus may mutate. She asked private poultry give their birds to the Agriculture, Fisheries &amp; Conservation Department. \nShe stressed there will not be any compensation.\nThe department visited 35 villages and 1,500 households in Sha Tau Kok and the North District in the past two days, with 113 chickens collected and another 112 vaccinated. The department's Acting Assistant Director Thomas Sit said most backyard poultry owners do not implement biosecurity measures. He called on owners to surrender their poultry.\nThe Customs &amp; Excise Department has stepped up patrols to prevent the inflow of smuggled chickens."}

Robida ran over spike strips in Norfolk and drove on two flat tires for a while. He ultimately wrecked his car into some parked vehicles while trying to avoid a roadblock on Arkansas State Road 5. Robida shot at the officers, who returned fire, shooting Robida twice in the head.

The contracts are the next element of the government's \"respect and responsibility\" reforms announced last month.\nPremier Iemma believes that the contracts will help to reduce juvenile crime by forcing parents to take responsibility for their children's actions.\nParents would be forced to sign the contracts by the children's court. They could require parents to attend parenting classes, undergo counselling, stop drug use or stop consuming excessive amounts of alcohol depending on the situation. The NSW Deparment of Community Services would be allowed to apply to the court for the contracts to be drawn up.\nIf parents failed to comply with the contracts their children would be removed by authorities.\nThe Department of Community Services would be able to apply to the court for contracts to be drawn up.\nThe plan follows the murder of a taxi driver in Sydney by two 14-year-old girls last week. Following the arrest of the girls, Mr Iemma said he was concerned about the whereabouts of the girl's parents. Mr Iemma denies that the contracts are a kneejerk reaction to that incident. \nSpeaking of the plan Mr Iemma said, \"We know the majority of people naturally take their responsibilities as parents very seriously.\"\n\"However, those children who are failed in this regard by their parents are at risk of becoming adolescents and adults without respect.\"\nNSW Community Services minister, Reba Meagher referred to studies showing that out of 1,000 neglected children, 256 came into contact with the juvenile justice system.\n\"There is plenty of evidence to show that children who are failed by their parents are more likely not to complete their schooling, to become involved in crime and to abuse their own children.\" said Ms Meagher.\nA similar proposal has been made in South Australia by the opposition. The Liberals have promised a similar system of contracts in South Australia if they are elected.\nChild welfare advocates claim that it is not clear whether or not the plan is the best solution to the problem.\nJane Woodruff from the Association of Child Welfare Agencies said \"Do we know that this is the right strategy and if we do, where's that evidence, where's that research, where's that practice experience so we don't make mistakes in such an important area?\".\n\"If parents are going to be required to attend a certain range of services, who's actually going to provide those services?\" she said.\nTasmania's Human Services minister, David Llewellyn said that he has not been able to look at the proposal in detail, but felt that \"on the surface it does not seem appropriate legislation for Tasmania\"."}

In some cases, they have removed facts from the articles. \nUsing the public history of edits on Wikipedia, Wikinews reporters collected every Senate IP address from which Wikipedia edits had been made as of February 3, then examined where the IPs came from and the edits that were made from computers connected at those addresses. IP, or Internet Protocol, addresses are unique numbers electronic devices use to communicate with each other on an individual basis.\nThe investigation showed the vast majority of edits from Senate IPs were beneficial and helpful to Wikipedia. Examples include the creation of the articles on , which organizes students to promote in the developing world, and , which was designed to hold the body of first U.S. President George Washington within the White House Capitol building; and significantly expanding the article on in November. Dozens of small corrections have been made to grammar, spelling, or small facts \u2014 many of them related to the Senate.\nSenators' staff members have sometimes had to fight to correct inaccuracies. An edit to Jay Rockefeller's article by his staff removed information which may have been biased or untrue. The staff member who edited said, \"Apologies, I was new to using Wikipedia, and I didn't fully realize the workings of the website,\" after other users continuously reinserted the information. The staffer removed the suspect paragraphs 12 times until another Wikipedia user finally removed the information. Four days later, Wikipedia founder got involved.\nThe Senators' offices were contacted about this article, but no response was received before press time.\nJoe Biden.\nStaffers in the offices of Senator , who, according to his changed Wikipedia biography, \"announced in mid-June 2005 that he will seek the Democratic Presidential nomination in 2008 if he believes his message and vision for the country resonate with Americans,\" removed a paragraph about a 1996 plagiarism scandal, as well as changing the section regarding a possible 2008 candidacy to read very positively. A second staffer toned down and removed information about other plagiarism issues as well. The same addresses from Biden's office edited the article on Hamas, which has recently won a majority in the Palestinian Legislative Council, and is listed as a terrorist organization by Australia, Canada, the European Union, Israel, and the United States, to give its first two paragraphs a more biased stance by removing information about its social welfare programs.\nReferences, citations, and descriptions of ' use of the word \"ragheads\" were removed from Wikipedia's article, as was mention of legislation, co-sponsored by Burns, that would reduce Native American tribal sovereignty. These were replaced by a paragraph titled \"A Voice for the Farmer\". The citations supported the discussion of Senator Burns's legislative record regarding .\nThe staffers of Senator changed a description of Coleman as a liberal Democrat in college to an \"activist Democrat,\" and then to \"an active college student.\" They removed references to Coleman's voting record during his first year of Congress, which lined up with President Bush 98% of the time, which cited . They also removed a reference to Coleman being persuaded by to run for senator instead of governor in 2002.\n\"When you put 'edia' in there, it makes it sound as if this is a benign, objective piece of information,\" said Erich Mische, Senator Coleman's Chief of Staff, to the Associated Press. Mr. Mische admitted the Senator's office had made the edits, and he would take responsibility for removal of the sentence about the voting record. \"That probably should have stayed in there.\"\n\"It appears to be a major rewrite of the article to make it more favorable. If they're trying to edit in such a way to change the public record, that's a problem,\" Jimmy Wales said to the Associated Press about the incident.\nAccording to the , \"Coleman's decision to run for senator, rather than governor, was sealed during a walk with President Bush in the White House's Rose Garden,\" rather than Karl Rove. Rove had actually persuaded the former House majority leader of Minnesota and current governor, Tim Pawlenty, not to challenge Norm Coleman in the Senate elections. Still, other portions of the edit removed references to Karl Rove entirely, and their citations, while accentuating the positive side of several issues, including changing \"a budget bill that cut funding from a number of programs\" to \"a deficit-reduction bill.\"\nThe California block of Senate IP addresses made several edits to the article, removing reference to her membership in the Trilateral Commission and to her net worth, with husband , but also adding an extensive list of awards.\nEven more problematic than the edits to the article about Dianne Feinstein, however, were those made to the article about her husband. References to a 1992 fine for failing to disclose Mr. Blum had guaranteed her campaign loans were removed, along with citations, and a paragraph regarding a conflict of interest debate from 1997 when Mr. Blum had invested millions of dollars in Chinese businesses when Ms. Feinstein was campaigning in the Senate to lift trade sanctions against the country. Mr. Blum later announced he would donate all profits from his Chinese investments to charity.\nThe staffers of Senator removed a paragraph relating to Harkin's having falsely claimed to have flown combat missions over North Vietnam, and his subsequent recantation after inquiries by the \"Wall Street Journal\" and . Another paragraph removed related to a supposed pro-Israeli stance.\nOther edits to Senate articles.\nWikinews reporters also discovered that a handful of miscellaneous vandalism edits had been made to some Senators' articles. Vandalized articles included those of Tom Coburn and Harry Reid. The edits to Reid's were made three times, while the Coburn vandalism was made two times, after it had been restored to a prior version. An edit to an article about a controversy over Senator Rick Santorum's statements about Constitutional rights to privacy with regards to sexual acts, seemingly coming from Rick Santorum's staff members, removed a reference to an effort to redefine Santorum's last name as a neologism meaning \"the frothy mixture of lube and fecal matter that is sometimes the byproduct of anal sex.\"\nIP address mapping.\nThe U.S. Senate Sergeant at Arms owns the IP block 156.33.0.0 to 156.33.255.255. Requests to learn the mapping of these thousands of IPs were not responded to at press time. However, the lower 100 blocks of addresses appear to be mapped to the 100 Senators based on their state's alphabetical listing. This was partially confirmed using e-mail responses from the offices of Senators; where the originating computer was connected to the network directly and was not a part of block 222 (a section which seems to be reserved for servers), the IP addresses matched the predicted pattern.\nWhen examining the edit behavior of IPs it also tended to match the predicted pattern. IPs which were assigned to Florida had edits to and and other Florida-related pages primarily, while those assigned to California had edited . Edits coming from the U.S. House of Representatives were less traceable because they came through a ---meaning they all showed up under one IP address."}

ElBaradei had given Iran until March to answer IAEA questions. By a vote of 27 to three (with five abstentions), and without the information in ElBaradei's report planned for March 2006, the IAEA recommended that the matter of the Iranian nuclear program be brought before the Security Council.\nThe recommendation claims that there are serious concerns about Iranian nuclear aims, and the agency does not have confidence that the program is intended solely for civilian or other non-military use. Although the meeting was taken without waiting for ElBaradei's March report, the recommendation requests ElBaradei to make his report anyway, including a list of \"steps Iran needs to take to dispel suspicions about its nuclear ambitions\" by March 6.\nThe IAEA's resolution calls for Iran to reinstate a freeze on its nuclear programs, consider ending construction of a plutonium-producing heavy water reactor, and to continue allowing the IAEA's purposes and actions in Iran. However, the council will not implement any further action until ElBaradei makes his full report on March 6.\nElBaradei also reported to the IAEA Monday that Iran would also demand a reduction in the amount of facilities inspections from the agency, and that they would discontinue their agreement to the Additional Protocol of the (NPT) if the agency reported Iran to the Security Council. This protocol entitles the IAEA to hold unannounced inspections of facilities, increased surveillance capability, and placing IAEA seals on nuclear equipment.\nOther diplomatic ventures are being planned.

But Moussaoui, 37, who was unrestrained by shackles and wearing a green jump suit labeled with the word \"PRISONER\" across the back, said \"These lawyers are not my lawyers,\" referring to the defense team led by federal public defender Gerald Zerkin. \"Everybody here know that these people do not represent me.\"\nThe unsolicited comments prompted the judge to dismiss him. Moussaoui offered no resistance as he was led away by marshals, but shouted over his shoulder to the judge, \"I don't want them to represent. I'm al-Qaida; they are American. They are my enemies.\" He said of the proceeding, \"This trial is a circus.\"\nA jury pool of 18 members, six of whom will serve as alternates, will be selected from the group of 500 potential jurors who appeared Monday. Four court sessions were convened that day to begin sorting through the candidates, and Judge Brinkema allowed Moussaoui to return for each of the three remaining sessions. She instructed potential jurors, \"If any of you feel that that outburst or the way he conducted himself might affect the way in which you would go about judging this case, you need to clearly put that statement on the jury questionnaire.\"\nThese instructions were repeated to each group of potential jurors after Moussaoui conducted similar outbursts during the remaining sessions, which resulted in his further dismissals.\nMoussaoui, in a surprise, pleaded guilty in April to six conspiracy charges of terrorism, leading to yesterday\u2019s start of the jury selection to decide whether he will spend the rest of his life behind bars, or be executed for his involvement in the 9/11 attacks. \nMoussaoui was arrested on immigration charges three weeks prior to the attacks. The prosecution contends that he could have prevented the attacks by alerting authorities to the Al-Qaeda plans while he was jailed in Minnesota after his arrest. \nExternal links.\nUnited States v.

A Norweigian researcher had made up patient histories of about 900 people for a study on cancer. Richard Horton, the editor of \"The Lancet\", in which the research appeared, has responded to the scandal, \"Peer review is a great system for detecting badly done research, but if you have an investigator determined to fabricate an entire study, it is not possible to pick it up.\" \nWhile carefully examining the data for every publication would be prohibitively expensive, several techniques to screen for falsified data have been developed. For example, images can be checked for after-the-fact manipulation. The scandals have led to some readers looking more carefully at suspicious papers for evidence that the data are human-manufactured. Jan Hendrik Sch\u00f6n's fraud was partly revealed due to just such analysis by readers in 2002.\nSome institutions are taking further steps to prevent fraud. In October, Emory University introduced a tip line where people can anonymously report suspicions of scientific misconduct. So far, five investigations have been launched based on reports to the tip line.\nWhile many are working to deter future scandals, some scientists have pointed out that such fraud does not discredit all science. Dieter Imboden, the president of the Swiss National Science Foundation's Research Council, has said: \"Bear in mind that every experiment will be repeated at some stage and it is one of the important principles of science that only things which can be verified independently by different groups are considered to be safe scientific facts.\" "}

Both forward Jon Cabarrus and guard Dylan Gordon followed their own shots and scored on putbacks. Forwards Xavier Moya and Chris Thompson provided tough inside defense on one possession. While Los Lunas managed several rebounds, they were unable to get any baskets over the outstretched arms of Moya and Thompson.\nCabarrus scored on another putback for his fourth points of the game late in the quarter, helping Academy to a twelve to eight lead at the end of the first.\nThe second period was a low scoring one for both teams. The Chargers scored just nine points, but also held Los Lunas to only three. Both offenses were struggling when guard Andrew Matthew stole the ball and made a pass to Gordan, who threw another pass to fellow guard Jordan Fleisher, who took the ball and scored on a layup.\nWith a minute in the half, reserve Matt Brown took a pass and drove the length of the court for a layup.

Leading the way in the second half was Patrick Zacharias, who scored seven points in the half.\nGordon connected with Thompson on a play that gave Thompson a layup. Gordon stole the ball away from Los Lunas and made a pass to Thompson while sandwiched between two Los Lunas defenders.

The quarter ended with Academy still holding the lead, 33-22.\nAA was again playing tough defense midway through the fourth quarter until #32 hit a three pointer, sparking a small Los Lunas rally, but it was not enough to overcome the offense and defense of the Chargers. \nZacharias scored on a tip in of a Gordon shot that hung on the rim and fell out. Zacharias was also fouled on the shot and made the free throw to complete the three point play. Team manager Lincoln Stanfield also saw action in the game, and even scored his first points of the season at the end of the fourth quarter. With less than fifteen seconds left, Stanfield received a pass underneath the basket. His shot didn't fall, but he was fouled with seven seconds left. Stanfield's first free throw bounced up after hitting the rim but didn't fall through. His second shot bounced high in the air two times before falling through the hoop.

Members of COAG are the , , Australian Capital and Northern Territory , and the President of the Australian Local Government Association. COAG is chaired by the Prime Minister.\nOn the agenda is a wide range of issues such as health, economic reform, regulation, and education.\nThe state leaders (all of whom are members of the ), met last night to develop a strategy for dealing with John Howard, Australia's Prime Minister.\nHealth.\nCOAG is expected to agree on a AU$1 Billion health package. The centrepiece of the package will be reforms to mental health care. Other elements of the package include the introduction of the national health call centre network, accelerating the implementation of a national electronic health records system, and reducing the number of disabled young people living in nursing homes\nMr Howard said yesterday \"I want all of the heads of government of this country to understand it's a serious issue and the Australian public will expect no less than a coordinated genuine commitment by all of us to try and solve the problem.\"\nMr Howard told federal parliament yesterday part of the problem can be attributed to the closing of mental health institutions. \"There is abundant evidence that that process went too far, and whilst I do not advocate and I do not believe Australia would benefit from turning back the clock to the institutions of old, nor can we as a decent society tolerate having people with mental illnesses out in the community unsupported and untreated.\" said Mr Howard.\nThe Mental Health Council of Australia's Chief Executive, John Mendozza said there needs to be a massive injection of funds into mental health care and it needs to happen quickly.\n\"Any Australian who has attempted to access mental health services through the public system will have found that unless they are extremely unwell, and that is a danger to themselves or the community, they probably won't gain admission to those public mental health services, and that simply is not good enough.\" said Mr Mendozza.\nThe Prime Minister has also accused cannabis of playing a role in Australia's mental health problems. \"I think we are paying a dreadfully heavy price for the abuse of what was so called recreation and socially acceptable drugs despite the clear evidence, unaccepted until a few years ago, that these things were doing massive damage within our community,\" Mr Howard told parliament yesterday.\n\"I will ask them (the state premiers) to agree with me that part of the solution to the mental health problem is a tougher line on marijuana, and I imagine they will agree with me,\" said Mr Howard.\nMr Howard signaled that he supported the move in New South Wales to increase penalties for cannabis, especially hydroponic cannabis which the NSW government claims is stronger. \"I welcome the change in direction of many of the states,\" he said.\nThe Mental Health Council of Australia has warned the government of over-estimating the role of cannabis in mental health. John Mendozza told ABC \"I don't think we should overstate the role of cannabis in the nation's mental health crisis. It is a factor, but it is not the reason that we now face a mental health crisis.\"\n\"The real reason is that governments collectively have under-funded the investment in community services for well over a decade and hence we have a large unmet need in the community.\" said Mr Mendozza.\nThe national health call centre network was announced by the federal government in January as a means of reducing the number of people going to hospital emergency departments for treatment. Under the plan call centres would be set up with trained nurses who could advise people on the best cause of action to take for a wide variety of health problems.\nUnder the health package the introduction of an electronic health records system known as HealthConnect will be fast tracked. Governments promise that HealthConnect will improve the quality and safety of health services by providing timely and accurate medical history on a patient. Participation in HealthConnect will be voluntary and patients may withdraw at any time.\nEducation.\nCOAG will also discuss setting up a national inquiry into early childhood education. The inquiry is expected to explore the possibility of free access to pre-school education. COAG documents warn \"By the time Australian children enter formal education, they have very different levels of preparedness for life and learning,\"\n\"Australia's investment in early childhood development before school entry remains low by international standards.\" says the documents.\nCOAG is also to explore how to implement a system to ensure trade qualifications gained in one state can be used in another. Under the current system, the majority of trade qualifications gained through state technical colleges are not recognised in other states. Only the small percentage of courses which award certificates under the Australian Qualifications Framework are recognised nationally.\nThe federal government has also indicated that it wants $11 million spent over four years ease skills shortages in trades such as plumbing and electrical. Federal opposition education spokeswoman, Jenny Macklin said \"Eleven million over four years will have little or no impact on the raging skills crisis which is hurting Australian businesses and families,\"\n\"It will provide just 900 training (places). The Australian Industry Group has predicted that by 2010 we will need 100,000 extra skilled tradespeople if we are to address the skills crisis.\"\nEconomic Reform and Regulation.\nThe topic of economic reform is expected to arouse debate at the meeting today as the federal, state and territory governments argue about how to fund it.\nVictorian Premier has been one of the key figures behind the plan which has been worked on by state and federal officials over the past past six months.\nFrom 1995 until 2004, the federal government made payments to state and territory governments for reaching milestones in deregulating their economies. If a state failed to meet a required reform as determined by the National Competition Council payments were withheld until the milestone was met. John Howard abolished the scheme stating that the states and territories already received enough revenue through the .\nThe states are said to be arguing that the federal government should be sharing the revenue achieved through their reforms.\nIt is expected the plan will fail to reach agreement and will have to be considered by a working party.\nFederal treasurer Peter Costello has said that economic reform should be bought about by abolishing eight state and territory port and export authorities and create a single national regulatory authority.\nThe treasurer also indicated he would like to see utility regulation become a federal responsibility.\n\"Australia would be better served if it could get a uniform system of regulation in relation to ports and port access, in relation to access regimes generally, and in relation to utilities,\" Mr Costello said."}

The illegal wiretapping was carried out by spy software installed in phone provider Vodafone's central system and discovered when the company started receiving complaints from customers about their phone service last March. The case, as well as the government investigation that followed, became public last Thursday in the Greek press. \nWhile the government refutes main opposition party's PASOK accusations of mishandling the investigation by keeping it secret, the identity of the culprits remains unknown, although both American and MI6 agents are widely blamed. The Greek government has said four antennae near the US embassy in Athens were used to transmit the conversations recorded. The embassy is located at approximately the center of the surveillance triangle. On Thursday approximately 800 protesters in Athens marched peacefully to the US embassy and shouted anti-CIA slogans while about 400 protesters in Thessaloniki clashed with the police, after trying to smash traffic cameras. \nThe death of Vodafone employee Kostas Tsalikidis contributes to the espionage-mystery nature of the case. Tsalikidis, who was Vodafone Greece's head of network design at the time, was found hanged in his Athens apartment on March 9, 2005, two days after the illegal taps had been discovered. While his death was at first ruled as suicide, his family has filed a lawsuit claiming he was murdered. The lawsuit calls for his body to be exhumed, an autopsy to be performed and his apartment investigated. A check of emails on Vodafone's server was also requested in order to locate evidence of their deletion, and the company to give details on why they were deleted. His brother Panagiotis Tsalikidis has already given testimony quoting his brother's fianc\u00e9e claiming that a few weeks before his death Tsalikidis told her that \"Vodafone is in danger of closing down,\" and \"leaving Vodafone is a life and death matter.\"\nWhile the case continues to unfold, a poll shows a great majority of the Greek public believe the government has not revealed all the evidence pertaining to this case. Most also believe that foreign secret services, governments, and embassies are most likely responsible for the wiretaps. \nThe government has not released all the names of the people that were victims of the illegal wiretapping.

The tests say that they had elevated levels of hemoglobin, an enzyme within red blood cells that can increase endurance. However, the positives results could be due to the body's acclimation to mountain air, or dehydration.

Reynolds was represented by Federal Defender, Nick Veith, at the hearing.\nAccording to the transcripts, FBI agents say that Reynolds was plotting to blow up the Alaska pipeline, another pipeline in Pennsylvania and a refinery in New Jersey, with a person who he thought was an al-Qaeda operative. It is also reported that he had planned an attack against Standard Oil Co. in Perth Amboy, New Jersey and Williams Refinery in Opal, Wyoming. However, the Standard Oil refinery, now Chevron, does not exist anymore. The refinery had closed more than a decade ago. All that remains in its place is an empty field. Armada Hess is the only active refinery in Perth Amboy.\nSo far, Reynolds has not been charged with terrorism. \nHowever, a prosecutor in Reynolds' December hearing said that, \"he tried to provide material aid to al Qaeda.\" The prosecutor also said the case \"involves a federal offense of terrorism.\"\nA municipal judge from Conrad, Montana, Shannen Rossmiller, 36, led the FBI to Reynolds by posing as an al-Qaeda operative. Reports say that Rossmiller was looking through terrorist websites when she came across a post by Reynolds who was seeking $40,000 that he would use to buy fuel trucks that would blow up refineries in New Jersey, Wyoming and part of the Alaska Pipeline. After six-weeks of e-mailing each other, Rossmiller agreed to pay the money, and set up a meeting with Reynolds in Pocatello, Idaho. It is reported that after the plans were made, Rossmiller then contacted the FBI who then set up a sting operation, two months ago, against Reynolds. \"I feel compelled to do what I can and I know that I have an ability to do something. I'm out for the hunt,\" said Rossmiller.\nRossmiller started to look through terror websites just after the September 11 terrorist attacks in NYC. She has read the Koran, studied the radical Islamist lifestyle, and learned just enough Arabic to lurk around in terrorist related chat rooms and \"ensnare\" the extremists. She also said that he has \"assumed several the identities of more than two dozen male personae on the Internet,\" and was also part of \"a large number\" of cases involving the hunting of terrorists. Court records also show that Rossmiller had posed on the Internet as an Algerian terrorist to \"befriend\" Ryan Anderson, a Muslim convert and a member of the National Guard from the state of Washington, who wanted to hand over information to al-Qaeda on how to destroy Army tanks and humvees.\nAssistant U.S. Attorney John C. Gurganus Jr. said, according to transcripts, \"he (Reynolds) was doing it as a plan to disrupt governmental function, to change the government's actions in foreign countries, and to impact on the national debate about the (Iraq) war.\"\nReynolds denies trying to work with al-Qaeda and stated that he was \"a patriot seeking to expose an al-Qaeda cell inside the United States.\" Philip Gelso, Reynolds's attorney, has not commented on the case. \nAuthorities searched Reynolds' home and took his computer as evidence, and some documents allegedly spelling out his terror plots. According to Gurganus, in e-mails on his computer, Reynolds \"described what explosives should be used (in the attacks) and where they should be placed.\" Gurganus also told the judge that Reynolds, \"knew the plots could get him the death penalty as a traitor and that he would have to leave the country immediately once they were carried out.\" \nAccording to the British The Inquirer, Microsoft was issued a subpoena last month to allow the Department of Justice access to Reynolds' hotmail account.\nReynolds has been in Lackawanna County jail, held without bail, since December 5, 2005, when he was arrested about 25 miles from the Thunderbird Motel in Pocatello, Idaho for an unrelated weapons charge. He was charged with possession of an unregistered explosive device when authorities found a grenade in a duffel bag that was inside a home in Pocatello that Reynolds was staying at before he came to Idaho. The grenade charge carries a minimum sentence of three to seven years, to be served in a federal prison. On December 20, a jury indicted and charged Reynolds with two counts of unlawfully possessing hand grenades. \nReynolds pleaded guilty to attempted arson in 1978, a misdemeanor and menacing. He was sentenced to a conditional discharge. He has also been previously convicted of disorderly conduct, resisting arrest and breach of the peace.\nThe Times-Tribune received a letter on the 13th that used Reynolds\u2019 return address at the Lackawanna County Prison and bears a rubber stamp as used to mark outgoing mail from the jail that detailed Reynold's denial of ties to al-Qaeda. The letter is postmarked with a date of February 10th, before the Philadelphia Inquirer story was published.\nTitled \"Patriot Games,\" the letter's content addresses the charge regarding the grenade found at his residence in a comment stating that it was planted there \"by someone known to myself and to the FBI.\" In denial of work for and also in denial of any desire to work for al-Qaeda, Reynolds wrote that \u201cI know what losses terrorists inflict on people. I would never work to assist them or harbor any,\u201d referring to his claim of a colleague being killed in the September 11 attacks on the Twin Towers.\nIn the letter Reynolds explains the investigation that he claims to have been working on to track \"a person that I had believed to be a terrorist\" and to expose them \"once I had solid proof of who or where they operated from.\"\nReynolds claims that his family founded Bedford Hills, New York in 1676. He further claims that he personally has given military service in the US Army, written a Military police handbook, trained SWAT and drug enforcement teams. He further claims to have been an engineer with military clearance and to have taught in Thailand as a first grade teacher and also an English teacher to Buddhist monks.\nAs an explanation for his prosecution, Reynolds has written that he believes it to have been due to his military service and that he believes the case would be dismissed provided a hearing in front of a judge.\nWhen questioned as to the authenticity of the letter, prison warden Janine M. Donate said that the letter appeared to be from the prison."}

The vote was reached during a six-member sub-committee meeting on Thursday.\nThe Virginia Senate, the upper house of the General Assembly, passed on Monday a week ago a bill that would ban the indoor smoking of tobacco in restaurants, bowling alleys, and other public places, including workplaces. The bill was not expected to pass the House, but the thumbs up signal by the Senate signaled a shift in tolerance towards the product in a state known for its 400-year economic history steeped in the cultivation of the cash crop.\nThe General Laws sub-committee based its vote on the rights of property owners, rights that would be violated by a state-wide ban. The debate was largely centered on the issue of restaurant smoking. The committee noted there was no law that said a restaurant must allow smoking. \n\"They have a right not to go where people are smoking,\" said delegate John Cosgrove (R-Chesapeake). He noted the consumer and the restaurant businesses can decide whether to allow smoking. \"They have a right and responsibility to take care of themselves,\" he said.\nA Virginia Beach restaurant owner, Matt Falvey, said \"The plain truth is that the majority of our citizens do not smoke, and do not want to be around smoke,\" according to the \"Richmond Times-Dispatch\". Falvey, who owns three restaurants, said \"In addition, restaurant workers should not be subjected to the harm caused by secondhand smoke.\"\nFalvey said he has smoking sections in his restaurants because not to would put him at a competitive disadvantage with other restaurants that have smoking sections. An across the board state-wide ban would level the playing field by settling the issue.\nSenate Bill 649, known as the Virginia Indoor Clean Air Act, to become law in the nation's 4th largest tobacco growing state would require passage by the House. Last year, the Senate killed a similar bill to ban indoor smoking in public places. New procedural rules introduced in Virginia this year allow a bill's passage to be blocked by sub-committee, but there remains a slim chance it could be revived. \nThe original version of the bill, which allowed cities and counties to decide locally on the issue, was voted down by the Senate. The bill was brought back by Brandon Bell of Roanoke County, and passed in a revised version that would make than ban state-wide, with no local authority on the issue. The measure was passed by the Senate in a 21 - 18 vote, after it received the support from the Virginia Restaurant Association. \nIn Maryland, a similar ban was voted down this week by a House committee. New Jersey is the latest state to join the ranks of a total of 11 states that ban smoking in restaurants, bars, and workplaces.\nSoybean over-took tobacco as Virginia\u2019s top cash crop in 2005."}

The Bush administration maintains that the congressional measure authorizing war in September 2001 empowered eavesdropping without any court issued warrant.

The program also alleged that prisoners at Abu Ghraib had been killed when U.S. soldiers ran out of rubber bullets as they tried to handle a jail riot, and started to use live rounds.\nExecutive producer Mike Carey said Dateline had obtained a file containing hundreds of pictures, some known and others that show new abuses. However, he declined to say how the pictures came into their possession.\nSome pictures appear to show U.S. soldier Charles Graner who had a leading role in the earlier Abu Ghraib abuse scandal. Many of the new images are more graphic than those previously published - these new photos include prisoners performing sex acts and wounded/dead prisoners. SBS alleged the photographs of the dead bodies were of people who had died at Abu Ghraib during interrogation. \nThe Guardian cites an unnamed US defense official saying that the Army had reviewed the pictures posted by SBS and confirmed that they were among those that are subject to the Freedom of Information Act request made by the ACLU. The American Civil Liberties Union has been granted access to pictures in possession of the army that had not been publicly released by a U.S. federal court in September, but the U.S. government appealed the decision.\nPentagon spokesperson Bryan Whitman stressed it is U.S. policy to treat all detainees humanely. He further said that \"The abuses at Abu Ghraib have been fully investigated,\" and that \"When there have been abuses, this department has acted upon them promptly, investigated them thoroughly and where appropriate prosecuted individuals.\"\nThe pictures have been shown widely on television throughout the Middle East, including in Iraq. Saleh al-Humaidi, a Yemeni journalist, told Reuters \"This is truly American ugliness that no other country in the world can compete with... the Americans ought to apologize to mankind for their government's lie to the world that it is fighting for freedom and that it came to Iraq to save it from Saddam Hussein's oppression.\" \nU.S. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld testified that not all known photographs of the abuses at Abu Ghraib had been publicly released at the Senate Armed Services Committee inquiry in May 2004. Mr Rumsfeld said, \"beyond abuse of prisoners, there are other photos that depict incidents of physical violence toward prisoners, acts that can only be described as blatantly sadistic, cruel and inhuman.\" "}

Canadian Idol is a national singing competition that is organized by CTV Inc. a Canadian broadcasting communications company for Canadian citizens. The television show, greatly based on \"American Idol,\" has been on going for several seasons. In the past auditions have been know to have line-ups of thousands of people, however, this year after taking a tour around the new location it appears that line ups were manageable. Having the auditions at the St. Laurent Shopping mall makes this easier said Idol's security coordinator Rick Paciorek. Organizers have decided to change the way the auditions will \"rock and roll.\"\nHaving decided last minute, Saturday evening, to participate in the singing contest I decided to practice \"I heard it through the grape vine\" and \"It's all coming back to me now.\" Lined up and registered on Sunday at around 10:30 a.m. the whole thing was fairly easy. Compared to previous year\u2019s contestant may show up at any time they wish, in between the hours of 8:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m.\nAt 10:30 a.m. Sunday morning there were no real line ups for registration. Security and Canadian Idol greeting staff did however say that Saturday was \"crazy (busy) with people lining-up as early as 5:00 a.m.\"\nAfter receiving my competition number 16350 I tagged it to my shirt and ran back around to wait in line. Compared to my previous experience in Toronto 2003 this was heaven. A few competitors explored the shopping mall during this time. In Toronto 2003 the line up lasted about 18 hours before I got passed the first step.\nAnxiety was in the air and to sooth the feeling a lot of people socialized. I talked to the closest person to me, a girl called Bambi that sings regularly at a local pub called the Royal Oaks. She sings every Thursday. Just before heading off to the audition a large pack of competitors just came back from the new Museum of War. As I waited in line I wondered if I should practice my songs. Within no time, we were up! We were called to sing in front of two judges in groups of five. The whole ordeal was over within approximately 2 hours. Actually, by 12:30 I was at home eating lunch and a little disappointed in my last minute decisions.\nAlso, compared to last year the maximum age limit went up from 26 to 28 years old. Participants may now be between the age of 16 and 28 years old.\nThere is even a \"forum\" discussion for those that want advice or comments about Canadian Idol. .

Next week's program will also include interviews with a US soldier that has been convicted of prisoner abuse and another former soldier who witnessed the crimes. \nThe \"Washington Post\" has noted, as suggested by SBS, that several news outlets including themselves have \"not published a substantial number of photographs they are holding.\" The \"Washington Post\" further explains that \"Newspapers that have held these images have been constrained, in large part, by the sheer graphic nature of them, especially the nudity.\"\nThe \"Washington Post\" also cites SBS's ability to circumvent \"the U.S. government's efforts to keep Abu Ghraib images out of the public eye\" as another reason why the images were not first published by other media outlets.\nThe U.S. internet news site \"\" has now published some of their own previously held back pictures and confirmed that they possess \"files and other electronic documents from an internal Army investigation into the Abu Ghraib prisoner-abuse scandal\", which include the originally published pictures, as well as the ones published by SBS. \n\"Salon\" notes that some of the files from the Criminal Investigation Command refer to CIA agents that interrogated prisoners at Abu Ghraib, but that no CIA officers have been prosecuted \"despite the death of at least one Iraqi during a CIA interrogation there\", underscoring the claim made by SBS that some of the pictures document previously unprosecuted abuse. \nThe US government expressed concerns about the new abuse pictures being published. John Bellinger of the State Department told \"BBC\", \"We felt that it was an invasion of the privacy of the detainees themselves to have these photographs come out... (and that the publication could also) fan the flames around the world and cause potentially further violence\".\nExternal links.\n5 of the newly published pictures"}

The virus has been found in migratory birds much earlier than had been expected.\nTests have confirmed that wild swans in Greece, Bulgaria, Italy, Austria and Germany had died from the deadly H5N1 strain of the virus. Other suspected cases of the virus have been detected in Slovenia, Croatia and Denmark.\nEuropean health officials had expected wild birds migrating from Africa to Europe in spring to carry the disease into Western Europe. It is thought that swans were migrating from Russia and Ukraine to the Black Sea driven by unusually cold weather.\nGlobally, 91 people have died after contracting the virus from close contact with diseased birds, but the greatest concern for European authorities is that an outbreak will occur among domesticated fowl, destroying local poultry industries. The H5N1 strain of bird flu is highly contagious, and lethal to birds. A single outbreak can kill tens of thousands of birds, and all birds must be culled across a wide region to prevent the spread of the disease.\nNo domesticated poultry or humans are thought to be infected in Western Europe at this time. Authorities continue to conduct intensive checks.\nA number of countries across Europe, including Denmark, Sweden and the Netherlands have required that domesticated fowl be kept indoors. In Germany and Hungary, two mile protection zones have been placed around the locations where dead swans, with all poultry required to be kept indoors and the shipping of meat outside the zones prohibited.\nThe European Union has toughened its bans on poultry products and now bans the importation of untreated bird feathers into its 25 member nations. The EU also hopes to test 60,000 wild birds and 300,0000 domestic birds as part of its bird flu surveillance program.\nIn France, the government asked citizens to keep domesticated fowl indoors throughout the country. Domesticated ducks will be vaccinated."}

That is the reason why, for the first time for days, the international community is united. It's not just the Europeans -- France, Germany and the British, it's also Russia and China.\"\nHowever, on a French radio station the Iranian chief nuclear negotiator Ali Larijani said, \"contrary to all the propaganda against us, we are not seeking a nuclear bomb, since we are a signatory to (the nuclear) . We are a responsible country - it is Western propaganda that keeps on saying that Iran is seeking a bomb, but it is not true.

Foreign Ministry spokesman Qin Gang has said that Beijing wants a \"peaceful solution by diplomatic means.\"\nIran resumed small-scale on Tuesday, after the IAEA reported it to the UN Security Council.

During discussion of the crisis of nuclear proliferation less than one year earlier, in the month-long 2005 Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, several representatives of non-aligned states complained about the violation of Article VI of the NPT by the official nuclear weapons states, including France, who allegedly have not yet made significant moves towards nuclear disarmament as required under Article VI, and about nuclear proliferation to previously non-nuclear weapons states, such as Germany, under \"\" arrangements."}

The petition levelled allegations against the Prime Minister, Thaksin Shinawatra, of having maintained influence over Shin Corporation and been involved in the decision to sell the family's remaining stake in the company to Temasek Holdings, the investment arm of the Singapore Government.\nThe court's decision to reject the petition seeking impeachment was reached following an 8-6 vote. The submitting senators were said not to have provided evidence documenting Thaksin's interest in Shin Corp. or how he was involved in the sale. This is despite a former judge from the Constitutional Court endorsing an opinion shared by some senators and academics that the court was bound by law and precedent to review the allegations.\nThe president of the Federation for Democracy, Weng Tojitrakarn expressed disappointment at the court's decision not to review the petition, stating that \"It's the duty of the court to seek evidences\". He pledged that his group would press for the resignation of the eight judges who supported the Prime Minister.\nAccording to Weng an interview with the Prime Minister's son, Panthongtae Shinawatra, reveals Thaksin's involvement in the sale. Panthongtae is said to have claimed the sale was a matter for \"puyai\", which Weng interprets as meaning Thaksin.\nThis is not the first time that Thailand's beleaguered PM has faced judgement from the court, nor may it be the last. In 2001 the court acquitted Thaksin by an even closer 8-7 vote. The charge in that case was concealment of assets. A new petition being organised by students of Thammasat University calling for impeachment has reportedly reached 20,000 of the 50,000 required signatures.\nFurther controversy over the PM's family's involvement in Shin Corp. was revealed in a Thai News Agency report. According to the Secretary-General of the country's Securities and Exchange Commission the PM's son and daughter may face fines for failure to report their shareholding in Shin. Other issues relating to Shin Corp. are also under investigation by the SEC with collection of evidence and documentation expected to be complete within a week."}

They will formally present their research to the Lowy Institute in Sydney today.\nProfessor Warwick McKibbin, a well respected economic modeller, member of the board of the Reserve Bank of Australia and health expert and Dr Alexandra Sidorenko modelled the effect of a bird flu pandemic on human health and the global economy. Their study looks at four possible scenarios - mild, moderate, severe and extreme.\nUnder the mild scenario, they predict that 1.4 million people worldwide and 2,100 Australians would die. The extreme scenario predicts 140 million worldwide deaths with 214,000 Australians among them. 30 percent of the Australian population would be expected to become infected should a pandemic occur.\nIn the extreme case, the global ecomomy would suffer losses of US$4.4 trillion or 12.6 percent.\nProf. McKibbin says that his economic estimates do not only include the cost of death but also for lost productivity. In an interview with ABC, Professor McKibbin said \"Firstly, there's a reduction in the labour force. Now, interestingly it's not just that people die which is causing economic loss, but actually there is a substantial amount of illness in any influenza pandemic. \"\n\"And so we try and capture both the death and the impact of that on the economy as well as illness during the pandemic, and including the fact that different economies have different labour market structures and that it's not just workers that get sick but also children, and we try to model the fact that carers will be taking time off work. \" said Prof. McKibbin.\nPandemics have broken out every 10 to 40 years since the 19th century. The last pandemic was in 1968 caused by the Hong Kong flu. \n\"It is 37 years since the last pandemic and many argue that another pandemic is overdue,\" warns the report.

So far, 19 people have been confirmed dead. Up to 1,500 are thought to still be missing. The Red Cross has despatched a plane with rescuers and basic equipment; they have also appealed for US$1.5 million for relief supplies for the affected area. \nIt is believed that the slides were triggered by heavy rains of up to 200cm (79 inches) in just 10 days and an earthquake of magnitude 2.6. Some residents had already left the area previous to the disaster fearing landslides but had returned following easing of the rain.\nHouses and an elementary school packed with children were buried, officials and witnesses said. Photographs and footage show only coconut trees and a few tin roofs sticking out of the soil after part of a mountainside collapsed on the farming village of Guinsaugon in Southern Leyte province.\nRescue efforts are being hampered due to continual rock falls, washed out bridges, chest deep mud and a lack of heavy equipment. \"Rescuers are scared because they can still hear the mountain rumbling,\" said Maria Lim, the mayor of Saint Bernard, where a minor earthquake was felt on Friday morning. President Gloria Arroyo has ordered the navy and the coast to the area to assist with relief efforts when conditions improve. Two US vessels are also on their way to help."}

The ban is expected to come into force from summer 2007. \nThe originally proposed fine of \u00a3200 was raised to \u00a32500 for failing to stop people smoking in banned areas in the late stages of the parliamentary process. Other fines include a fixed penalty notice of \u00a350 for lighting up in banned areas and spot fines of \u00a3200 for failing to display no smoking signs in banned areas.\nSmoking may also be banned in \"substantially enclosed\" venues such as railway stations and football stadiums; this may also include cars carrying passengers but no decision has been taken on this as yet. Ministers will finalise precise regulations after a three month consultation.\nThe vote was politically fraught, as the Labour Party in government had proposed a 'compromise' bill, in line with their election manifesto, which would allow pubs not serving food to be exempt from the ban. With many Labour MPs threatening to rebel against this compromise however, in favour of a full ban, Labour granted its members a free vote. MPs then voted for the full ban by a margin of 453 votes to 125,\u00ad a majority of 328.\nMPs then debated a last-minute amendment to exempt private members clubs, which was also rejected, by 384 votes to 184,\u00ad a majority of 200. The Prime Minister, Tony Blair, voted for a complete ban along with his health secretary, Patricia Hewitt.\nThe ban will bring England in line with Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales, which will all be introducing a full smoking ban for pubs and clubs. The bill also gives ministers powers to increase the age for purchasing cigarettes from 16 to 18 which ministers will begin the consultation process upon shortly."}

The chase was splendidly orchestrated.\nIt was Sreesanth who dented Pakistan in the morning after Zaheer Khan and Ajit Agarkar shared the new ball. The Kerala paceman, who is learning fast, cut down on his pace realising that there was not too much assistance for him from the wicket. He struck thrice and Pakistan, from 62 without loss, slumped to 77 for three. In the context of the match, Sreesanth's spell of 5-1-25-3 was crucial. Both Imran Farhat and Kamran Akmal, after putting together 62, fell to pull shots, and Shoaib Malik steered right into Suresh Raina's hands at gully. There is fluency about Sreesanth's run-up and action that is hard to ignore, and he did bowl well at the death, swinging the ball into the right-hander.\nAnd off-spinner Ramesh Powar won a leg-before decision against an ominous looking Inzamam on the sweep; the delivery drifted into the right-hander from outside the off-stump and then straightened.\nPakistan recovered through a strokeful fifth-wicket stand of 95 in 110 balls between Mohammad Yousuf (67, 85b, 6x4) and vice-captain Younis Khan (74 not out, 79b, 3x4, 2x6). Yousuf appeared set for his hundred when he flicked Ajit Agarkar into Zaheer Khan at mid-wicket.\nAbdul Razzaq biffed a 15-ball 24 before miscuing a pull of R.P. Singh, but Pakistan lost some momentum towards the end. However, the 18 runs off the last six balls by Zaheer came in handy for the side; Younis twice smote the left-armer over the mid-wicket ropes.\nThe bowlers, backed by aggressive fielding, had performed a fair job, under the conditions."}

Some are threatening to storm the mine while soldiers are trying to keep them calm and rescuers continue to pick through the rock and debris with hand tools, fearing that any power equipment might set off another explosion. \nThe local newspaper's headline caused panic by quoting one of over a dozen surviving miners who were close enough to the exits to escape: \"They are surely dead,\" (\"La Prensa de Monclova\"). However, Arturo Vilchis, Civil Protection Director, refused to speculate on the condition of the miners, while Javier de la Fuente, an engineering contractor with mine owner Grupo M\u00e9xico S.A. de C.V. also tried to hold out some hope.\nThe men were each supposed to be carrying oxygen tanks, each with a six hour supply, and there's some hope that they could reach other oxygen supply tanks, or that some air might be reaching them through the ventilation shafts into which rescuers have been pumping more oxygen since shortly after the explosion.\nJuan Rebolledo, vice president of international affairs for Grupo M\u00e9xico, assured onlookers that U.S. mining experts were on the way, and officials at the U.S. Mine Safety and Health Administration have confirmed that they've sent a specialized equipment truck and several mining experts which should arrive at the mine site on Wednesday afternoon.\nMeanwhile Consuelo Aguilar, a spokeswoman for the National Miners' Union, called for an investigation into Grupo M\u00e9xico's responsibility for the disaster.

The meeting, attended by at least 140, was originally to consider the Elmwood Village Hotel but also included a new revitalization proposal from Rocco Termini which would increase retail space, but involves less demolition and no hotel. \nRocco Termini, a Buffalo, New York developer wants to develop the corner of Elmwood and Forest, the same spot where Savarino Construction Services Corporation want to build the Elmwood Village Hotel.\nTermini proposed that a similar revitalization take place on the intersection like one that incorporated 3 buildings on Aurburn and Elmwood just last year. Termini's proposal will add more retail space than Savarino's proposal with the possibility of including up to seven retail outlets.\n\"I just think it's necessary to preserve the streetscape that we have. That's the whole point of living and shopping on Elmwood,\" said Termini. \"You should be able to go into little shops, that have unique items, and that bring people to Elmwood. When you bring a big box on Elmwood Avenue, it takes something away from the urban-streetscape, just as suburban areas do not want a big box Wal-Mart. We don't want a big box on Elmwood avenue and I think that's just what this (the hotel) does, brings a big box to Elmwood,\" said Termini. \nWhen asked if there were any development companies currently interested in his proposal Termini said, \"I will be willing to take a look at this myself,\" said Termini. \"Or I would be more than happy to be partners with Sam, Sam Savarino,\" who is President and Chief Executive Officer of Savarino Construction Services Corp.\nAn unnamed source close to the project stated, \"Rocco has serious concerns that the Mobius's asking price could make his project infeasible.\"\nIt is unknown if Savarino Construction or the city of Buffalo will consider Termini's proposal.\nTermini purchased and developed several buildings and areas including the Ellicott Lofts on Ellicott Street in Buffalo, which opened in 2003, The Oak School Lofts which used to be a Buffalo Alternative School, and \u2018IS\u2019 Lofts on Oak Street in Buffalo.\nEva Hassett, Vice President of Savarino Construction, and Karl Frizlen an architect from The Frizlen Group and designer of the hotel commented on the development proposal. Hassett said, \"We've been thinking about it and trying to put it together for the last few months, and it was made public a couple of weeks ago.\" \n\"There are lots of different areas you can look at. This is an Elmwood Avenue hotel. Putting it somewhere else makes a completely different kind of hotel. We wanted a hotel that people could walk to from the business on Elmwood. We wanted a hotel that people could walk to from the Albright Knox Art Gallery. This is really a location for this kind of hotel. Other locations end up being for other kinds of hotels,\" said Hassett\n\"We are excited about the concept of a boutique hotel at this corner. We think it makes sense to the various businesses in the area or the galleries just down the street. We also believe that this is a way for the visitors of Buffalo to experience what the best of what Buffalo has to offer. We think it will be a great way for people from out of town, to get to know what we know about the city,\" said Hassett.\nAlthough Hassett had said that the proposal has only been around \"for a few months\", Karl Frizlen said that he came up with the idea \"three years ago when Hans Mobius,\" former owner of the properties at risk, \"came to me and asked what we could do with these properties.\" Frizlen also said that he introduced Mobius to \"four different developers, who after seeing the properties, did not want to tackle them, saying that they felt like it was too much for them to take on.\"\nHans Mobius did not attend last nights meeting.\nFrizlen is also designing the former telephone company building at 504 Elmwood which would be a \"mixed use building with retail on the lowest level and lofts on the other two floors.\"\nResidents and business owners voice concerns.\nAfter speeches from developers, residents and business owners were invited to present questions and comments.\nMark Freelend, a Buffalo resident, and local artist, said \"I'm looking at my house in the picture, and I'm picturing all the houses on Granger street behind me, and I'm realizing that, if this is implemented (the hotel), we will get zero sunlight. The Sun is supposed to be free, for everyone. The people on Granger are going to have eighty windows looking at them and their children being raised, and playing in the backyard, guests looking in the windows of their houses twenty-four hours a day. A million people starring into their houses. No sunlight, and they are on permanent reality TV. Put a price on that!\"\n\"I think this hotel is totally out of scale to the area and it does not conform to the style (of Elmwood) at all. It will totally obscure the gateway of Elmwood. The gateway now has open arms that allow for passage and view into the commercial corridor. This hotel stands as a brick wall as far as I can tell,\" said Nancy Pollina one of the owners of Don Apparel at 1119 Elmwood. Pollina referenced to the recent 'revitalization' project on Auburn and Elmwood saying, \"That building was boarded up for years, and that was beautiful a renovation. That building was not in any less need of repair than Hans Mobius's properties.\"\nDevelopment company may be 'moving too fast'.\nBoth residents and business owners in the area are concerned that the proposal is moving too quickly and said that the developers should wait before having any city meetings and wait for a consensus from the community on the hotel.\nMrs. Pollina said, \"I think people feel passionate about their neighborhood, and this is their neighborhood. I feel that what was most shocking is that the city's planning board meeting and Common Council meeting, which are they need to push this through, is next week without almost no notice. This (the proposal) is being rushed.\nHowever; Sam Savarino did say that \"some people have gotten emotional about this project. And I want to let the community know that we will listen to what you have to say. We're not forcing this down anybody's throat. If this is not something this community wants, we do not want to have it here.\"\nThe city's Planning Board is expected to meet on February 28, 2006 at 8:00am in room 901 on the 9th floor of City Hall. The city's Legislative Committee meeting of Common Council is expected to take place on the same day at 2:00pm in Council Chambers on the 13th floor of City Hall.\n'Significant changes' to be made to hotel design.\nIt has just been confirmed from an unnamed source close to the project that \"significant changes\" will be made to the design of the Elmwood Village Hotel. \"Its not being cancelled, just redesigned,\" he said. The changes are not yet known, but they are could be released \"tomorrow. He (Savarino) doesn't want it released until he touches base with a few people today.\""}
{"id": "34081", "revid": "39076", "url": "https://en.wikinews.org/wiki?curid=34081", "title": "Australian children suffering from iodine deficiency", "text": "Almost half of all Australian primary school children are mild to moderately iodine deficient, researchers say. A new study documenting iodine nutritional status in Australian schoolchildren has revealed many are not getting enough iodine - which can lead to mental and growth retardation. The report's authors say iodine deficiency is \"the sleeper health issue in Australia\", and potentially a very serious one.\nThe results of the Australian National Iodine Nutrition Study published in the Medical Journal of Australia this week, revealed that children in mainland Australia are borderline iodine deficient. The report has prompted calls for all edible salt to be iodised. They say adding the mineral to salt is the simplest and most effective method of preventing iodine deficiency disorders.\nA cross-sectional survey of 1709 schoolchildren - aged 8\u201310 years, from 88 schools - was carried out in New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, Western Australia and Queensland, between July 2003 and December 2004. Tasmania was excluded from the study - where an voluntary iodine fortification program using iodised salt in bread, is ongoing.\nThe authors say the results confirm the existence of inadequate iodine intake in the Australian population. They call for \"urgent implementation of mandatory iodisation of all edible salt in Australia.\" Most iodine in food comes from seafood, milk and iodised salt.\nProfessor Cres Eastman, Director of the National Iodine Nutrition study, and Chairman of the Australian Centre for Control of Iodine Deficiency Disorders, says it is crucial that children and pregnant women in particular have an adequate intake of iodine. Iodine deficiency can lead to serious health problems including brain damage, stunted growth and deafness.\nProfessor Eastman says manufacturers could easily remedy the situation by using iodised salt in their products in line with the United States and most European countries. \"I suspect they won't do that on a voluntary basis, we've tried so far and haven't succeeded, so we've convinced the Food Standards of Australia and New Zealand| that all salt should be iodised,\" he said.\nThe report says the decline in iodine intake appears to be due to changes in the dairy industry, where chlorine-containing sanitisers have replaced iodine-containing sanitisers. Iodine released from these chemicals into milk has been the major source of dietary iodine in Australia for at least four decades, but is now declining. Another contributory factor has been the decreasing consumption of iodised salt used in foods. The report states that few if any food manufacturers use iodised salt in the preparation and manufacture of foods. \nProfessor Eastman says iodine is added to only 10 per cent of Australian salt in contravention of a World Health Organisation recommendation that all salt be iodised. He says authorities are reacting slowly to his urgent calls for mandatory iodised salt.\n\"The effects of iodine deficiency are dependent upon how severe it is and when it occurs. So if we go to the pregnant woman, she doesn't get enough iodine, she won't make enough thyroid hormone, and the foetus won't get the amount of thyroid hormone it needs for adequate and proper development of the brain, so you'll then see consequences being loss of IQ, learning difficulties, hearing difficulties and other neurological problems,\" Professor Eastman said. \n\"If an infant's not getting enough iodine... brain development won't be completed and they won't grow normally, and as you get older the problem will be that you will develop a goiter and your thyroid won't function as well as it should, so that may have all sorts of pernicious effects upon normal function in life.\"\nMore than two billion people around the world live in areas prone to iodine deficiency, and yet the problem is easily fixed. The World Health Organisation (WHO) recommends that every country should iodise all edible salt. The most well known effects of IDD are visible goiter and cretinism, a condition characterised by severe brain damage occurring in very early life. WHO say Iodine deficiency is the world\u2019s most prevalent, yet easily preventable, cause of brain damage.\nProfessor Eastman said he is alarmed by what they found. \"Pregnant women in Australia are getting about half as much as what they require on a daily basis. So that alarms me, because there's quite serious potential for adverse effects and brain damage in the next generation of children born in this country,\" he said. \"If Iodine deficiency is serious you lose 15 IQ points, on average. There shouldn't be anyone suffering from iodine deficiency in a developed country like Australia.\"\nLydia Buchtmann for Food Standards Australia New Zealand, says they are looking at mandatory guidelines on iodine by the end of the year. She says the issue is complicated and will take time to get right. We need to \"make sure there's sufficient iodine added into the food supply, to help those people with a deficiency. But at the other end of the scale we've got to make sure the people who eat a lot of food - we all know the teenage boy who comes home from school and eats a whole loaf of bread - that those people don't get too much and get overdose,\" Ms Bauchtman said. \"One of the reasons that iodine is going down is because people are taking that good healthy eating message and not adding salt during cooking.\"\nSenior researcher Mu Li, of the University of NSW's school of public health, said \"it is reasonable to assume that pregnant women and breastfeeding mothers are also iodine deficient, putting the next generation of children born in this country at risk of the neuropsychological consequences of iodine deficiency.\""}

Doug Wankel, a former Drug Enforcement Administration official who is point man for the U.S. counternarcotics initiative at the American Embassy in , said the opium industry is \"financing terrorism. It's financing subversive activities. It's financing warlordism. ... And if it's a threat to the government of Afghanistan, it's a direct threat to the national security interests of the United States.\"\nAustralia recently committed 200 extra troops to Afghanistan. John Howard has said that they also will not be involved in destroying opium poppies. \"Well, dealing with that is overwhelmingly the responsibility of the local authorities,\" he said. \nA 2005 U.S. State department report warned that Afghanistan is becoming a \"narcotics state\". Afghan hectares in opium cultivation has increased by 50% since the coalition invasion; up from an average of 67,000 prior to the invasion (1998-2001), to an average of 97,000 since the invasion (2002-2005).

President Karzai has blamed the coalition for this situation, \"This particular operation (controlling opium production) was supposed to be done by an agency, a department that was funded by the international community, by the United States, by Britain. The failure is theirs, not ours.\" Karzai said. \"Where international money and creation of forces for destruction of poppies was concerned, it was ineffective and delayed and half-hearted.\" Karzai is opposed to aerial spraying which was proposed by the United States, as is done in other drug producing regions of the world, because of what Karzai called \"health concerns\".\nAdrian Edwards of the United Nations stated 2 months ago that early reports indicate \"there will be an increase in poppy cultivation in 2006\"."}

(Earthquakes are generally listed in UTC time to ensure an absolute and consistent basis of when they occurred.) This may have been felt several hundred kilometres away.\nLocated North of Thurso.\nAccording to the \"Canadian Press\" the earthquake was centred north of Thurso, Quebec, \"approximately 45 kilometres east-northeast of Ottawa, said John Adams, a seismologist with Natural Resources Canada.\" Witness reports state somewhat violent shaking with little or no property or personal damage. \"It started as a rumble, then shaking... the whole house was shaking and the glasses were rattling,\" said Jeff Thiessen, a resident of Manor Park. One Ottawa resident said \"the ground shook for about 30 seconds and was felt by residents near the city center.\" There were no immediate reports of injuries or damage to property.\nAccording to the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) \"A magnitude 4.0 eastern earthquake typically can be felt at many places as far as 100 km (60 mi) from where it occurred, and it infrequently causes damage near its source.\"\nFollow-up reports indicate that rumbles could be felt as far as Kingston, Ontario, Montreal, Quebec and New York.

Mr Costello's comments targeting Muslim extremists, won support from Prime Minister John Howard, and controversial ex-politician . \n\"Before entering a mosque visitors are asked to take off their shoes,\" Mr Costello said. \"This is a sign of respect. If you have a strong objection to walking in your socks don't enter the mosque. Before becoming an Australian you will be asked to subscribe to certain values. If you have strong objection to those values don't come to Australia.\"\nAbdul El Ayoubi, a director of the said, \"it's upsetting to hear such comments, especially when you consider that the majority of Muslims have accepted the Australian way of life and Australian values.\"\n45 per cent of Australia's population are from culturally diverse backgrounds. The Ethnic Communities' Council of Victoria (ECCV) has called for tolerance rather than division. \"Peter Costello's comments are divisive, arrogant, provocative and do nothing to unite the nation at a time when responsible leadership on this issue is called for,\" ECCV chairman Phong Nguyen said. \n\"To have the leaders of our nation, such at the Prime Minister and Treasurer, making gratuitous comments about race and religion based on ill-founded perceptions rather than facts, is extremely divisive and will harm Australia nationally and internationally,\" he said.\nMr Nguyen said Mr Costello appeared to be aligning himself with the \"now discredited argument of his colleague \u2013 that Australia is in danger of becoming a Muslim nation\". \nIn his speech Mr Costello made a public call for Muslims who want to live under sharia law to find another country, while also referring to \"mushy multiculturalism\". \nJustin Li, vice chair of the NSW Ethnic Communities' Council, said Mr Costello's comments had deliberately and unfairly targeted Muslims.\n\"Obviously nobody supports violent people in our society, but what we don't understand is why allegedly violent Muslims are any different from any violent people of other cultures or religions,\" he said. \"What about deporting the people who participated in riots in last year? Those people did not exhibit any Australian values in their actions.\"\nMr Li added the comments were \"political point scoring\" made to sit well with sections of the community which do not support multiculturalism. \"Our political leaders think that there is advantage to be gained making comments against our Muslim Australians at this stage in time,\" he said.\nMalcolm Thomas from the says it's the fact that Mr Costello singled out Muslims. \"If you remove the word Muslim from what he said, well then I totally agree with Peter. Yeah, I'm prepared, just as much as Peter, to be as intolerant to anyone who wants to attack Australia and the Australian values, irrespective of their race or religion or ethnicity,\" said Mr Thomas. \"Language is everything. The words are marginalising a segment of our community and creating division within the community.\"\nMr Thomas also points out that the suggestion to strip people of citizenship has limited potential, given that a third of Muslims living here were born here. \"Australian Muslims are Australian. We can't differentiate that. And I think people need to keep that in mind.\" he said.\nAnother Muslim community leader said Costello is promoting division and and should be censured. , president of the Islamic Friendship Association of Australia, has said he genuinely hoped the Prime Minister would censure Mr Costello.\nMr Trad said nobody was protesting Australia's laws through any other means than the normal democratic process. \"We have not asked for sharia law to be imposed. I don't know anyone in this country who is asking for sharia law to be imposed and I don't known anyone in this country who has rejected the rule of law,\" he told . \"Rather than try to promote understanding and harmony in this society, his comments are highly divisive and he is stirring up Islamophobia, and these comments should really be beneath any decent politician.\"\nIn his speech, Mr Costello said where there was reason to believe people were not truthfully or honestly meeting their citizenship test, there was every right for them to be denied citizenship.\n\"If by subsequent conduct they show that they don't meet the test then we could invite them to forfeit their Australian citizenship,\" he said. \"Now you can only do this if they have another citizenship.\" \nBut Mr El Ayoubi said: \"If you've come to this country, you've come to this country to live under a democratic system and you've come into this country to abide by the rules, the principles and the values of this country, and you should do that.\"\nMr Costello emphasised that Australia is a secular state under which the freedom of all religions is protected. \"But there is not a separate stream of law derived from religious sources that competes with or supplants Australian law in governing our civil society,\" he said. \"The source of our law is the democratically elected legislature. If a person wants to live under sharia law these are countries where they might feel at ease. But not Australia.\"\nMr Costello said there were some beliefs and values which were so central to Australian society that those who refused to accept them refused to accept the nature of Australian society.\n\"If someone cannot honestly make the citizenship pledge, they cannot honestly take out citizenship,\" he said. \"If they have taken it out already they should not be able to keep it where they have citizenship in some other country.\"\nHis comments follow Prime Minister John Howard's claims this week that a fragment of the Islamic community is \"utterly antagonistic to our kind of society\". Last week Liberal backbencher Danna Vale said that Australia could become a Muslim nation within 50 years because \"we are aborting ourselves almost out of existence\".\nMr Costello said he had attended an Australia day citizenship ceremony at the Stonnington Town Hall in his electorate of Higgins during which a state MP \"extolled the virtues of multiculturalism\". He said the MP said becoming an Australian did not mean giving up one's culture or language or religion \u2014 and it certainly did not mean giving up the love of their country of birth.\n\"The longer he went on about how important it was not to give up anything to become an Australian, the more it seemed to me that, in his view, becoming an Australian didn't seem to mean very much at all, other than getting a new passport.\"\nIslamic Council of Victoria president Malcolm Thomas said he was disappointed at Mr Costello's speech. \"We have had the uninformed comments of Danna Vale, we have had the comments made by the Prime Minister and now we have these comments \u2014 all they do is reinforce a stereotype which doesn't exist.\" Mr Thomas said that singling out Muslims was pandering to a conspiracy that Muslims wanted to overtake Australia.\n\"Australian Muslims are Australians first,\" he said. \"They abide by the law and they want to live here in peace and harmony. They are not interested in taking over the country. They are not interested in creating a theocracy\".\nIkebal Patel, an executive member of the , said the comments were \"inflammatory\". \"Islam law teaches that when you go into a country you embrace the laws of that country,\" Mr Patel said. \"I hope we are not going away from multiculturalism as the founding stone of our immigration policy.\"\nMr Patel said the timing of the comments smacked of an attempt by the Government to deflect attention from the AWB scandal. \nMr Costello said Muslims who did not like the depiction of the in newspapers should recognise this does not justify violence."}

Counterprotesters threw bottles, fireworks and many different objects at riot police. \nHowever, an on-looker stated \"They have no right to be coming down here and rubbing our noses in it.\" He added that many Catholics also suffered during the conflict known as the \"The Troubles\". Kelly Ann Moore, 20, a republican protester said \"Loyalist protesters knew what was going to happen if they tried to do this. They were trying to provoke this violence.\"\n\"The Troubles\" is an ongoing conflict that stems from the partition of Ireland in the 1920s into two entities, the Irish Free State and Northern Ireland. The Irish Free State eventually became the Republic of Ireland, an independent nation, while Northern Ireland became a constituent part of the United Kingdom. The conflict is split into two camps, the nationalists or republicans which advocate a united, single Ireland and the unionists or loyalists which advocate a continued union with the United Kingdom. The conflict also boils down into religious divides as unionists are generally Protestant and nationalists are usually Catholic.\nTaoiseach (Prime Minister) Bertie Ahern condemned the violence and stated \"There is no excuse for it and that it is the essence of Irish democracy and republicanism that people are allowed express their views freely and in a peaceful manner.\" \nOther politicians condemned the violence too. Sean Crowe, Sinn Fein TD for Dublin South West said the rioting was \"disgraceful\" but included that the unionist rally had been \"provocative\". \nAlban Maginness of the Social Democratic &amp; Labour Party stated \"It is disturbing that marchers have been prevented from peaceful demonstration. This action of extreme republicans simply plays into hands of those of the unionist right who cannot conceive unionist rights being upheld in a new Ireland.\""}

Around 600 students marched under the banner of PRO-test, an organisation set up several weeks ago in opposition to SPEAK, which campaigns and demonstrates frequently in the city for animal rights.\nThe demonstration began at 11:30am outside Balliol College on Broad Street, in the historic centre of the city, and (just before midday) marched along Holywell Street and Mansfield Road up towards South Parks Road. Police prevented the PRO-test demonstration from reaching the actual building site because of a SPEAK protest (around 150 people, according to Thames Valley Police) which was occurring there at that time. The crowd was addressed by neurosurgeon Tipu Aziz, Dr Simon Festing (executive director of the Research Defense Society), and Liberal Democrat MP Dr Evan Harris, amongst others.\nStudents demonstrated for different reasons, however. Some were obviously marching in favour of animal testing in order to further medical research, while others wanted to show solidarity with researchers and the university, who have been coming under increasing pressure from organisations such as the Animal Liberation Front (ALF). \nLast year, the ALF claimed responsibility for its arson attack on the Long Bridges boathouse, and recently it put out a communiqu\u00e9 stating that they \"must target professors, teachers, heads, students, investors, partners, supporters and ANYONE that dares to deal in any part of the University in any way.\" SPEAK and the ALF are separate organisations; the former campaigns peacefully, while the latter often uses tactics such as threatening letters, intimidation and criminal damage to further its cause. It should be noted, however, that in an interview for Sky News on the 25th February, a spokeswoman for SPEAK refused to condemn their activities.\nThe PRO-test march returned back down Mansfield Road and Holywell Street (in order to avoid passing the SPEAK demonstration), and finished outside the Radcliffe Camera. After a few speeches, everyone dispersed, the demonstration having passed off peacefully, though there was an attempt by five SPEAK demonstrators to break through the police line. SPEAK activists continued to leaflet on Cornmarket Street, and marched down from outside the research lab into the centre around 2pm."}

In order for the development to take place, at least five buildings that house both businesses and residents, must be demolished.\nTo confirm and to get more information about the changes, \"Wikinews\" interviewed Eva Hassett, Vice President of Savarino Construction Services Corporation, the development company in charge of building the hotel.\nWikinews: The hotel proposal is being redesigned. Could you comment on that? What changes are being made? Are they significant?\nEva Hassett: The hotel has been resized as a 72-room, four story building. This is 10% smaller in number of rooms and a full story lower. We are also redesigning the facades in a way that will minimize the mass - more of a vertical feeling than horizontal. Different materials, windows, details. The smaller size of the hotel also makes the number of on-site parking spaces more appropriate and hopefully represents less of a challenge to an already difficult parking situation.\nWN: Will you still be going before the city's planning board as scheduled on February 28? Same for the Common Council?\nHassett: We will be on the Planning Board agenda this Tuesday morning but I do not expect that the Board will vote on the item that morning. I think we will be mainly explaining the new design and hearing input/questions.\nWN: Will there be anymore public meetings?\nHassett: We would be happy to do one more big public meeting. We will be talking to Forever Elmwood about that on Monday (February 27, 2006). We would like to see if there is support for the new design and we also want to honor the public's request for another meeting. I am hopeful that meeting can take place the week of March 6th.\nWN: Is Savarino considering Mr. Rocco Termini's design/proposal? If no, do you (Savarino) support/oppose?\nHassett: We are hopeful that we can build the hotel as redesigned. We think it would be a great addition to the Elmwood Ave. area, a good way for out-of-towners to see what Buffalo offers and a big help to the businesses there.\nWN: Are you considering more time for the community to make a judgment?\nHassett: As I mentioned above, we expect to have one more meeting to get public reaction to the new design, and I think the Planning Board may want an additional meeting to make their determination. We do however, have constraints that will limit the amount of extra time. We still think it is a great project for the City and Elmwood; and we still want it to be something that the community wants as well.\nSo far, the City of Buffalo's City Planning Board is still scheduled to meet at 8:00 a.m. (Eastern) on February 28, 2006 followed by the Common Council meeting at 2:00 p.m. on the same day.\nImages of the design are not yet available. \"We are working on the renderings this weekend, but I will likely have some early in the week,\" stated Hassett."}

Zafi-in Jae-loh, the deputy chairman of Narathiwat Islamic Committee said the move would do nothing to help the situation faced by ethnic Malay Muslims in the south. The three southernmost provinces, Narathiwat, Pattani, and Yala face near-daily bombings and shootings with a considerable armed forces presence contributing to tensions in the area.\nOpposition parties concerned that the three years early election will not resolve the current political situation have announced that they may boycott the April 2 poll. The Democrats (\"Phak Prachatipat\") and the smaller Great People's Party (\"Phak Mahachon\") took over 25% of the vote in the February 2005 elections.

The People\u2019s Alliance for Democracy was reported to be monitoring a crowd they were suspicious of ahead of the rally in Sanam Luang, Bangkok. However the main rally went off peacefully. Noon saw the arrival of former politician Chamlong Srimuang with the Santi Asoke Buddhist sect, including barefoot monks and nuns. Reports indicated that the total number in attendance and supporting the call for the now-caretaker Prime Minister to go were in the tens of thousands. Many protesters vowed to stay overnight. Alluding to past protests that had toppled Thai governments, Chamlong said \"We can eat anything, sleep anywhere. Tonight we will sleep here\". Anti-Thaksin banners displayed at the open-air rally stated that the he had \"No right to rule\", while others read \"Thaksin=Toxin\" below an image aimed at comparing the PM with Adolf Hitler.\nCalls for the PM to go have a long history, with his policy of pursuing his opponents through the courts drawing the attention of the King, thus leading to Thaksin dropping cases against media firebrand, Sondhi Limthongkul. A challenge through the country's Constitutional Court was brought by 28 of the country's senators following the PM's family selling their 49% share in Shin Corporation tax-free. The sale, to Temasek Holdings, was widely seen as allowing control of key telecoms infrastructure to pass into foreign hands.

And, secondly, because there is recent research to suggest that proportional systems have, on the whole, limited if not halted election turnout declines in comparison to Britain.\"\nThe POWER inquiry is funded by the Joseph Rowntree Charitable Trust and the Joseph Rowntree Reform Trust Limited, and the inquiry is holding a conference on Saturday, March 25, 2006 to discuss their findings, before formally ending.\nChair of the inquiry, Helena Kennedy challenged politicians to \"rise above their party ranks and start treating democratic reform as a non-partisan necessity - not a political toy\".\nThe Prime Minister's Official Spokesman said that the report dealt with many issues, which were all matters to be debated within parties and between parties, adding that the report had added to the debate.\nOliver Heald, Shadow Constitutional Affairs secretary for the Conservative Party, welcomed the call to give more power to MPs, but opposed the plan to drop the voting age to 16. The Liberal Democrats acting president Simon Hughes welcomed the report, saying \"British Democracy is in crisis whatever the Government pretends - most voters are ignored and most people feel they have no influence\"."}

The paper, authored by Andrew Norton, argues that the cap on loans to full fee paying students is too low. The current cap allows for loans during a lifetime of AU$50,950.\n\"Setting the FEE-HELP limit at this amount biases the market against courses that are long or have high per year costs, or both,\" argues Norton in the paper. \"The loan cap is a crude way of controlling lending, taking no account of course costs or capacity to repay.\"\nAccording to Norton, this undermines student choice and competition. He argues that the system should function more like commercial lending.\n\"A truly radical reform would make student loans mimic commercial loans: students with good earning prospects could borrow large sums, other students could borrow less, and some could not borrow at all,\" he said. \"Instead of denying or limiting loans to people doing high cost courses, as now occurs, the government could deny loans to people who are unlikely to repay.\"\nThe paper was criticised by Senator Kerry Nettle, Education Spokesperson for the Australian Greens. She argued that the changes would mean an increase in costs to students already struggling to pay, and called on Education Minister Julie Bishop to rule out the changes.\n\"To consider refusing loans to those deemed less able to repay would further cut off higher education for Australians from low socio-economic backgrounds,\" she said. \"Julie Bishop should use her address to the National Press Club tomorrow to rule out any moves to further deregulate the HECS system.\"\n\"Student fees have spiralled upward under the Howard government and any further deregulation would just make a bad system worse,\" she added.\nAustralian student fees system.\nThe Australian government has a system of subsidising student tuition fees. This system has undergone many changes during the Howard government. There are currently three strands:\nThe Centre for Independent Studies.\nOn its website, The Centre for Independent Studies describes itself as \"the leading independent public policy 'think tank' within Australasia. The CIS is actively engaged in support of a free enterprise economy and a free society under limited government where individuals can prosper and fully develop their talents. By critical recommendations to public policy and encouraging debate amongst leading academics, politicians and journalists, the CIS aims to build a better society.\" It claims to be funded by \"private sector donations-from individuals, companies and charitable trusts-as well as subscriptions and books sales.\"\nIn a press release the Greens described the think-tank as \"rightwing\"."}

Joel Golombeck, City Councilman for the Elmwood area, was also among the attendees.\nThe Elmwood Village Hotel is a seven million dollar proposal by Savarino Construction Services Corp. The hotel would be built on the intersection of Elmwood and Forest Aves. in Buffalo. In order for the hotel to be built, the demolition of at least five currently occupied buildings will be required.\nGolombeck found out about the proposal just three weeks ago when Sam Savarino of Savarino Construction Services Corp. called Golombeck. \nGolombeck said that he was asked, by the City of Buffalo to \"approve\" the proposal \"tomorrow\", (February 28, 2006). When asked to do so Golombeck replied, \"That is just not possible. I did not realize how fast tracked this plan was. My first question to Savarino was, did you talk to the neighborhood?\"\nGolombeck also stated that he would not approve or deny the proposal until a reasonable amount of time was given to the community to make a judgment on the new design.\nGolombeck also stated that the City of Buffalo wanted Savarino to obtain both 605 Forest and 607 Forest for the proposal, but, according to Golombeck, Savarino \"does not want to do that.\" In order for the two buildings to be included in the development, Savarino will have to apply for a C-2 zoning permit. It is unknown if an attempt will be made to obtain those properties or make the zoning changes.\nWendy Pierce of Forever Elmwood stated that she had found out about the proposal only \"two weeks ago from today.\" She also stated that the original design \"felt too massive.\" Pierce also stated that she wanted to \"speak more with the block clubs and residents\" around the area.\nMs. pierce also stated that \"other options\" for parking will be looked into \"if possible.\"\nThe new design will have less retail space and now has at lease three conference rooms.

Widespread squally thunderstorms with heavy rain and flooding are expected as the system moves further south. Approximately 280 millimetres of rain was recorded at Karratha in 36 hours.\nThe cyclone bore down on Australia's Pilbara region, bringing with it winds of up to 105kph. Dampier's port was closed, some flights to the region were cancelled and communities in the storm's path were battening down.\nCyclone Emma was west of Karratha and northeast of Onslow at 8am (WST) today, and travelling south at 23kph. The weather bureau said by the time the category one storm crosses the coast between Dampier and Onslow the worst of the weather will have passed.\n\"Most of the weather is travelling ahead of the system\", weather forecaster Andrew Burton said. \"They've probably had the worst weather by now, and by the time the system crosses the coast it will all be over really.\"\nPeople near the communities of Onslow, Karratha, Dampier, Mardie, Point Sampson, Roebourne and Wickham were warned the storm could cause gales with gusts of up to 105kph. At Karratha, torrential rain has left parts of the town awash. Roebourne shire airport spokesman Alan Wright said there was flooding on the road to Karratha airport. \nSix people were rescued after two cars were swept away by flood water dumped by the cyclone, oil and mining operations were shut down, Karratha, Tom Price and Pannawonica suffered localised flooding and three Pilbara schools had minor classroom and roof damage. \nFire and Emergency Services (FESA) issued an \"all clear with caution\" alert an hour after Emma crossed the coast and began breaking up as it moved inland. A spokesperson said: \"With a category one cyclone you are not looking at destructive winds and in this case the rain that preceded the cyclone was the biggest issue. But residents should only proceed outside with caution as there may be downed powerlines, fallen trees, broken water and sewage lines, loose roof sheeting and debris.\"\nCyclone Emma's approach sparked a series of precautionary shutdowns of mining, oil and shipping operations. Open cut mining operations around Tom Price were shut. Guests at the Fortescue River Roadhouse, 1425km north of Perth, were stranded because of flooding. \nThe weather also forced Woodside Mining to cease production at two of its operations in the Pilbara region. The company said it expected no major impact from the production interruption at the North West Shelf with operations to start producing again when the weather improves.\nCyclone Emma is the third cyclone of WA's cyclone season, which runs between November and April, with most activity in the latter half of the period. The Bureau of Meteorology say they are watching another developing tropical low that could impact WA over the weekend. \nThe first major tropical storm this year was category three cyclone Clare which battered Dampier and brought flooding rains to mining regions and much of the wheatbelt in early January. A week later category two cyclone Daryl threatened North West WA but moved off the coast. "}

Self-serve salad bars at the restaurants have been closed in response to a sabotage scare. Sizzler Australia Managing Director Bo Ryan said customer safety was always the restaurant chain\u2019s first priority. \nA media release on the Sizzler website states: \"As a precautionary measure and because customer health and safety is our number one priority, we have temporarily closed salad bars in all Sizzler Restaurants. We sincerely apologise for this major inconvenience.\" \nPolice said green pellets were found in pasta sauce at a Sizzler restaurant in Brisbane's inner-west on January 20. A regular customer at the Toowong restaurant told Sizzler staff she had found something odd in her bolognese pasta sauce. Similar pellets were found in a vegetable soup at Sizzler's Myer Centre outlet in the city about 5pm on Saturday. \nBo Ryan said the decision to close all of its Australian salad bars was made after laboratory tests confirmed that the substance in the pasta sauce was indeed rat poison. He said trainees who tasted the poisoned soup had been been taken to hospital by ambulance as a precaution, but had suffered no ill effects. \nQueensland Police Inspector Bob Hytch said no one had been reported ill as a result of eating the poisoned food and there had been no extortion threats. Sarah Kenny, a university student, said she and two friends had eaten spaghetti bolognese that \"tasted really weird\".\n\"The inconvenience to customers and the economic impact on the company and its 1600 employees will be severe, but as a family restaurant our first priority is the welfare of our diners,\" said Bo Ryan. \"Steak and seafood and a limited range of salads would continue to be available.\" He hopes that customers will understand the action was taken in their best interests, and that \"they can be patient while temporary product security procedures are developed and implemented in all restaurants.\" \nThe 29 Australian Sizzler Restaurants, along with 107 Kentucky Fried Chicken outlets are operated by the Collins Foods Group, a wholly owned subsidiary of Worldwide Restaurant Concepts Inc. Mr Ryan said Sizzler was assessing measures which could be taken to prevent a recurrence of the sabotage. \"As soon as new measures are introduced, over and above existing strict protocols, we will reassess the situation,\" he said."}

The government tests targeted for the presence of cannabis and amphetamines by use of a saliva swab. During the trial period, the presence of ecstacy was not tested, because at the time the trial period began, there was uncertainty over the accuracy of saliva tests for the drug.\nThe legislation comes in response to the discovery that one in 46 drivers tested were found positive for cannabis and/or amphetamines. Victorian Assistant Commissioner of Traffic, Noel Ashby said, \"It is one in 46 drivers that we're testing are prepared to take a risk and endanger the lives of other people and that's really what we're about, we're trying to prevent people endangering the lives of others\".\nOf 13,176 tests carried out during the trial, 199 drivers tested positive for amphetamines only, 19 for cannabis alone and 69 for both amphetamines and cannabis. Each driver who tested positive was fined at least AU$307 and lost three demerit points.\nPolice also conducted tests for ecstacy, despite being unable to prosecute those driving under the influence of ecstacy alone. During the trial, 25 drivers tested positive to ecstacy alone and more than 200 tested positive for both ecstasy and amphetamines.\nVictorian Police Minister, Tim Holding said existing penalties \u2013 which are softer than for drink-driving offences \u2013 were inadequate and would be toughened to ensure they reflected the seriousness of the offence.\nAt present, a first drug-driving offence incurs a $307 fine and three demerit points; subsequent offences a $1227 fine and up to a six-month loss of licence.\nIn comparison, a drink-driving offence attracts a fine of up to $1200 plus disqualification from driving for at least six months and up to 10 demerit points. Repeat drink-drivers face the possibilty of being penalised with a fine of up to $2500 or up to three months' imprisonment, plus a minimum one-year loss of licence and use of an alcohol interlock device for at least six months.\nUnder the random roadside drug-testing system, drivers who test positive are forced off the road for 24 hours. A second swab is then taken and sent for testing to identify the drug before penalties are issued.\nKen Ogden from the RACV said he would like to see every booze bus in Victoria be able to also operate as a drugs bus.

Washington-based environmental group, Forest Trends, linked Malaysian loggers to Papua New Guinea's political elite. It described working conditions as \"modern-day slavery\" and said forests were effectively being logged out.\nWhile the PNG Government does have laws and regulations to ensure sustainable timber production, these were not being enforced, the report states. It identified \"a political vacuum with no demonstrated government interest in controlling the problems in the sector.\"\nThe report summarised independent reviews of the timber industry between 2000 and 2005. Forest Trends claimed corruption had devastated rural living standards and ignored the basic rights of landowners: \"There are a few logging operations in the country which are deemed beneficial to both local landowners and the country, but they are lost in a sea of bad operators. The Government needs to support these companies, or risk having the international community boycott all of PNG's exports.\"\nNatural forests are being chopped down unsustainably, mostly by Malaysian companies, the organisation says.\nIt reports that much of the labour is imported, and says that Papua New Guineans are not getting an acceptable return for the logging while one of the country's precious natural resources is dwindling. Most of the timber is exported to China, and is often turned into products for export to Western countries.\nIf foresting continues in this manner, they warn, Papua New Guinea could be bereft of its natural cover in a decade. \n\"The system must be fixed,\" said Michael Jenkins, President &amp; CEO of Forest Trends. \"The nexus between the logging companies and the political elite needs to be broken. One way to do this is to help local landowners better understand their rights and to establish a legal fund so that they can be defended. Papua New Guinea's legal system does exist outside of political control and the courts have a track record of ruling against illegal logging.\""}

The hotel would be placed on Elmwood and Forest Avenues in Buffalo, New York. In order for the hotel to be built, at least five buildings, that include both businesses and residents, must be demolished.\nThe Forever Elmwood Corp. is a Buffalo-based non-profit organization founded in 1994. Justin Azzarella, the Executive Director for the organization voiced support for the proposal, stating: \"I am here today to lend Forever Elmwood's support the hotel project. Particularly, Forever Elmwood is encouraged by the fact that this building follows the more stringent Elmwood Village Design Guidelines. We have been speaking with Savarino Construction, and they have promised us [Forever Elmwood] that they will engage the community further, including the surrounding Block Clubs and businesses. For that reason, while Forever Elmwood is in support of this project and the type of project that it is, we are asking also that the project be tabled so that the community can be further engaged. Specifically the surrounding Block clubs which include the Granger, Claremont, Asland and The Lincoln Parkway Block Clubs.\"\n\"Because of the excellent work that Karl does and the game plan that they have, I think its an ideal use of this particular location. I think that this particular type of development needs to be encouraged and promoted as opposed to roadblocked,\" said a man who owns five properties near the proposal site.\nHowever, Evelyn Bencinich, a resident of Granger Place and whose house would be located directly behind the hotel said, \"My property value will be depreciated or non-existent because no one is going to want to live behind a multi-story hotel. We are facing up to a year of noisy and dangerous demolition and construction. Children, pets and even drunk rebellers could wander on site and get hurt. Traffic tie-ups caused by large machinery and garbage bins is inevitable. Where will pedestrians walk? We could experience increased unsanitary flooding in our yards and basements due to the digging and cementing for the underground parking garage. Rats will be displaced into the immediate neighborhoods and be in great abundance. Once we get past the year of nightmare construction, what if you build it and they don't come? We could ultimately have a seven million dollar rooming house on our corner.\"\nPatty Morris, co-owner of Don Apparel with Nancy Pollina at 1119 Elmwood also asked that the project be tabled saying, \"this has only been public knowledge for less than two weeks and the public never saw the redesign. How can you vote on anything that no one has seen yet? The Board cut off Morris saying, \"so specifically you don't have any problem with it [the design] you just...\" Morris then said, \"Oh I am totally against this project, but thats besides the point isn't it.\"\nPlanning board wants hotel smaller.\nThe planning board is also concerned that the current design may still be too big.\nAt one point Board member Susan Curran Hoyt said, \"we know you've cut down your number of rooms on this project, but we still see it doesn't seem to fit the description of a 'botique' hotel,\" and asked Eva Hassett, Vice President of Savarino Construction, \"we wonder if you could reduce the rooms further.\"\n\"One thing I didn't talk about was the price levels of these rooms and that will be important to know. The room rate will be somewhere between US$120 and $160 a night, which is about the same price of the Hampton Inn down town and the smaller you make the hotel, the more expensive the rooms will get. We believe that we've made a good compromise in terms of the size of the hotel and perhaps botique means different things to different people,\" said Hassett. \nThe board was also concerned that there is not enough parking asking, \"are there alternative plans for valet parking off-site, in the event that you have a full hotel or a large event going on?\"\n\"We are exploring several possibilities with respect to additional parking for valet and parking near-by,\" replied Hassett. \"We are also exploring the possibility of using the rear of 1105 Elmwood for additional parking, which would give us an additional ten or eleven spaces.\"\nThe new design has a total of 55 parking spaces for 72 rooms, with 39 of them underground and the rest on ground level.\nHassett also said that a \"parking study\" will be done on the area.\nConcerns that the second floor of the hotel will be too close to the property of 605 Forest were also brought up. The board asked how far the hotel would be from the property and Karl Frizlen replied saying it would \"be approximately five feet from the property line,\" but he also admitted that, \"I do not know exactly how close the house next door\" will be from the hotel, but did say \"I think the house is about four or five feet away from the property line and we [the hotel] sit right on the property line.\"\nThe board is concerned the setback from the property is not enough saying the space between the building and the hotel is \"pretty narrow.\"\nCommon Council also tables hotel proposal.\nThe City's Common Council also agreed to table the proposal also citing the need for more public engagement and the need for more organizations to respond including the Buffalo Preservation Board and the Office of Historic Preservation.\nDuring that meeting, Hassett also said the proposal to try and get a variance to obtain the properties of 605 and 607 Forest were \"now off the agenda.\"\nThe Common Council is expected to meet and hold a public hearing about the project and the rezoning of the properties to be demolished (1119-1121 Elmwood) on Tuesday March 7, 2006 at 2:00 p.m. in Council Chambers at City Hall. At the moment the properties are not zoned for a hotel."}

During the raze, 1,500 residents were incarcerated and tortured, and over 1,000 square kilometers of land was destroyed. The town was rebuilt shortly after the attack.\nThe former leader defended his actions and suggested that the court should be trying him, and him alone. \n\"I razed them... we specified the farmland of those who were convicted and I signed,\" he told the court. He later added, \"If it was a crime to refer for trial those accused of shooting at the president, then try me and save a lot of trouble\u2026\"\n\"I am Saddam Hussein. I was in charge, and just because things have changed, I am not going to say someone else was responsible.\"\nChief prosecutor, Jaafar al-Moussawi, presented the court with documents and letters in an attempt to link Hussein to the trials and subsequent executions. The documents consisted of over 100 death certificates of villagers hanged after being convicted by the Revolutionary Court, which has been called an \"imaginary trial\" by the prosecution. The documents also contained transfer orders for families that were relocated to the desert. One document, apparently originating with the Iraqi secret service, said that close to fifty of the accused had died during interrogation. \nDefending his co-accused, , Hussein stated, \"I referred them to the revolutionary court according to the law. Awad was implementing the law, he had a right to convict and acquit.\"\nHis defense team indicated that he was Iraq\u2019s president at the time and all actions were taken in accordance with Iraqi law. Nehal Bhuta, a legal expert for Human Rights Watch told ABC news, \"What we saw today was not Saddam admitting guilt, but admitting to the fact that he acted in accordance with his official duties and powers.\" \nBoth Hussein and his defense team remained subdued during the prosecution's testimony, a contrast with the often chaotic outbursts that eventually lead to Hussein and his lawyers refusing to return to court. \nThe trial thus far has seen the deaths of two defense lawyers, the resignation of a the judge who first presided in the trial, and numerous complaints by human rights groups that a fair trial is impossible.\nThe trial, which began last October, has been adjourned until March 12th."}

Participants were asked, \"Has the war in Iraq increased, decreased or had no effect on the likelihood of terrorist attacks around the world?\"\nFifteen percent felt that the likelihood or terrorism had decreased; 12 percent felt there had been no effect; and 13 percent did not answer.\nOut of the 35 countries polled, only Mexico and Nigeria thought the invasion lessened the likelihood of terrorist attacks.

The poll also found that results were split on whether the foreign troops should remain in Iraq until the country is stable: 35 percent said they believed the troops should stay, 32 percent felt the troops should pull out within a few months, and 13 percent thought that a pull-out should occur within a few months unless the government of Iraq requested them to stay.\n\"It's official.

John Howard is Australia's second longest serving Prime Minister, behind Sir Robert Menzies.\nHoward celebrated his decade in office last night at a gala dinner at Australian Parliament House in Canberra. Around 700 conservative supporters and business figures were present at the dinner.\nMr Howard gave a speech to his delegates, saying he was grateful to Australians for their support and promised to try not to abuse their trust. \n\"I am deeply conscious of the trust that you have put in us and I am deeply grateful... for the privilege that has come our way,\" Mr Howard said. \n\"We have tried not to abuse it and we will try in the future never to abuse it, because public life is the ultimate in terms of serving a nation and serving a community,\u201d he said. \nPeter Costello, Mr Howard's most likely successor gave a brief speech to the delegation saying \"It's not just a wonderful 10th anniversary for the coalition government.\"\n\"There is another 10th anniversary that we ought to acknowledge tonight - it's the 10th anniversary of Labor in opposition,\" he said.\nDespite many political commentators believing that Howard (now aged 66) will soon retire and hand the reins over to Peter Costello, Mr Howard told ABC radio, \"I will remain in the position as long as my party wants me to.\"\nMr Howard also showed his support for his likely successor saying \"If I were to go under a bus, the person who would and should become the leader of the Liberal party is Peter Costello. I am very careful crossing roads.\"\nLittle to celebrate - Opposition.\nThe opposition has used the occasion to attack the government on its performance over the last ten years. Opposition leader, Kim Beazley told a press conference on Wednesday that \"On this 10th anniversary of the Howard government we find record foreign debt - more than twice what it was that John Howard inherited.\"\nWayne Swan, Shadow Minister for Family and Community Services, said the government's celebrations come at a time when Australians are paying too much tax. \"Sadly, for the Australian people 10 years of the highest taxing Government in our history has given all of those taxpayers a much bigger hangover,\" he said\nA turbulent political career.\nJohn Howard has had a turbulent political career, since first becoming elected as a Member of Parliament in 1974. He was treasurer under the Malcolm Fraser government from 1977 until 1983, when it was defeated by Bob Hawke.\nFollowing the resignation of Fraser, Howard contested the Liberal Party leadership but was defeated by Andrew Peacock. Despite being defeated as leader, Howard stayed on as deputy leader.\nAfter being defeated by the incumbent Labor Party government of Bob Hawke, Peacock became nervous and attempted to protect his leadership by removing Howard from the deputy position. Howard restood for the position and won, putting Peacock in an uncomfortable position and prompting his resignation. This allowed Howard to succeed to the leadership unopposed.\nHoward held the Liberal Party leadership from 1985 until 1989, when he was defeated in a leadership challenge by Peacock. Howard's support was weakend following a speech in which he claimed that the rate of Asian immigration into Australia was too high. Following his defeat Howard was relegated to the backbench for a short time before taking a position on the front bench again. When Peacock lost the 1990 election, the Liberal Party began to look for a young leader - electing John Hewson. It was at this time that Howard conceded it unlikely he would ever be leader again. Howard himself compared the possibility of a political comeback to \"Lazarus with a triple bypass\".\nAfter Hewson lost the 1993 election to Hawke's successor Paul Keating, the Liberal Party again appointed a new leader, this time current foreign minister, Alexander Downer. When Downer resigned in 1995, with deputy leader Peter Costello unwilling to step up, Howard was elected to power for the second time.\nHoward's coalition government swept to power in 1996, holding 96 of the 148 seats in the House of Representatives ending 13 years of Australian Labor Party governance. Howard led his government to comfortable victories in 1998, 2001 and 2004."}

Bush during Hurricane Katrina. He stated in an interview with \"ABC\" on September 1st that, \"I don't think anybody anticipated the breach of the levees\".\nOne of the first items to emerge, a video obtained by the \"Associated Press\", shows footage of Bush during a video-conference received at his ranch in Crawford, Texas, on August 29, 2005, 19 hours before landfall of Hurricane Katrina. During the briefing, Director of the National Hurricane Center Max Mayfield warned, \"I don't think anyone can tell you with any confidence right now whether levees will be topped or not, but there is obviously a very, very great concern\". \nIn addition, Michael D. Brown, then director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), reported that he had spoken with President Bush twice in the morning and that the president was asking about reports that the levees had been breached.\nBrown would state later on \"CNN that, \"There's no question in my mind he probably had those reports (about breaches in the levees), because we were feeding in the Homeland Security Operations Center, into the White House sit room, all of the information that we were getting. So he had to have had that information. Plus, I think the president knew from our earlier conversations that that was one of my concerns, that the levees could actually breach\".\nIn July 2004, the Federal Emergency Management Agency completed an exercise called \"Hurricane Pam\", which, dealt with the scenario of a direct hit on New Orleans by a hurricane with 120 mph winds (a Category 3). It resulted in \"10 to 20 feet of water within the City of New Orleans,\" according to January 24 congressional testimony by the president of the company that designed the Hurricane Pam exercise. \nA report FEMA sent to the White House Situation Room on August 29th, they cited death and destruction anticipated by the \"Hurricane Pam\" exercise and warned that Katrina was likely to be worse. \"Exercise projection is exceeded by Hurricane Katrina real-life impacts,\" they stated. Furthermore, \"The potential for severe storm surge to overwhelm Lake Pontchartrain levees is the greatest concern for New Orleans. Any storm rated Category 4 on the Saffir-Simpson (hurricane) scale will likely lead to severe flooding and/or levee breaching. This could leave the New Orleans metro area submerged for weeks or months\".\nWhen the report was released, Hurricane Katrina was thought to be a Category 4 as of landfall (though after analysis, it's power at landfall would be downgraded to a Category 3). \nWhite House officials previously clarified Bush's earlier comment, saying that the president was referring to the hours after Katrina swept through and news reports as of August 30th suggested the city had \"dodged a bullet\", which led to surprise when reports reached them of the levee breaches. Contrasting this was the August 30th broadcast of NBC's Today, NBC Nightly News anchor Brian Williams reported at 7:05 a.m. ET, \"There has been a huge development overnight ... the historic French Quarter, dry last night and it is now filling with water. This is water from nearby Lake Pontchartrain; the levees failed overnight.\""}

Joe from Binnews told Wikinews he only found out about the MPAA's actions after reading it on several news sites. He said, \"At first, I double read the article making sure we were not being punk'd. But then I was shocked that we had to read about it publicly first. As of today (February 25), we have yet to get anything (from the MPAA)\".\n\"Descds\", an administrator of dvdrs.net told Wikinews that the first he knew of the action being taken against the site was when he was approached by the press and users of his site. He said, \"We haven't been informed by the MPAA and quite frankly are outraged by the method they have adopted to file these lawsuits. In actual fact we would still be none the wiser had our members and members of the press not have contacted us.\"\n\"When we found out about the filed lawsuit we was first worried (after all we are only a small site with limited funds), then shocked and finally outraged. Had the MPAA contacted us anytime in the sites history regards their concerns we would have happily worked with them to gain a resolve,\" he said.\nDescds also said that despite attempts to contact the MPAA he has received no response.\nWhen asked by Wikinews how they felt about discovering the MPAA's lawsuits both administrators said they would have appreciated being notified before the announcement was made public.\nBinnews told Wikinews, \"We do feel they should have notified first. We do not even have a confirmation this is for real.\"\nDvdrs said, \"We have stated many times had the MPAA personally contacted us we would have happily listened to their issues and acted accordingly. We are doing nothing wrong legally on our site and to be made look like an established piracy ring is an outrage. We have worked extremely hard on site to keep within international laws and they have publicly destroyed everything we have worked towards in the last two years. We are receiving negative PR and this is totally unacceptable.\"\nWikinews has discovered that both Binnews and dvdrs.net have procedures in place for dealing with alleged copyright infringement under the US Digital Millennium Copyright Act. Despite this, both sites deny ever being contacted by any organisation with a \"takedown\" notice.\nWhen asked if Binnews ever received a takedown notice, Binnews replied, \"Nope, we have never received a notice from anyone. My cell phone is tied to the site, we have proper DMCA guidelines on the site and no one has contacted us.\"\nWhen asked the same question, Dvdrs said, \"No never. We would actively respond to any DMCA request quickly and efficiently. We fully support the law and would never try to evade anything within its scope. Had a DMCA been issued by any member, our site would have immediately deleted the offensive file.\"\nWhen asked how they would deal with a DMCA takedown notice, Binnews said, \"We would act quite quickly. An email sent to the alert system is tied into all of \"staff\" members, my cell phone and my email.\"\nAccording to Dvdrs, they would be equally as compliant. \"We would immediately delete the offending file on our server and conduct a thorough research into any files that may also be connected to the one mentioned. We would also respond to the request personally with a follow up email expressing our actions,\" they said.\nWikinews asked the administrators if they thought their sites were any different to conventional search engines like Google and Yahoo. Binnews replied, \"No, you can go to any search engine and find just about anything.\"\nDvdrs also shares Binnews' position telling Wikinews, \"No. We index what is already readily available on commercial, tax paying, US based registered companies hard drives. All we are doing is pointing to files not on our network, much the same way google or any search bot operates. We do not host these files and without the premium paid service of third parties our marked up text based XML files are useless. We have never hosted illegal files and only offer information.\"\nDvdrs has expressed that if the MPAA deems them illegal they should also target those who are actually hosting the files. Descds said, \"We feel that should the MPAA deem us illegal then they must also target premium paid Usenet Providers who act as the transit for these files. Ironically both Easynews and Usenetserver offer both indexing and carrier for these files and yet have received no such lawsuits filed.\"\n\"We also find it ironic still that Newzbin, creators, instigators and promoters of the NZB format and un-arguably the biggest Usenet Indexing site in the world have received no lawsuits filed. We feel that we are being rail roaded and are not at all happy about it.\"\nOn the other hand, Binnews was surprised that the MPAA did not target ISPs and Usenet providers in the first instance. \"Cut the head off and there is nothing for us to index and report on. If the ISPs acted in a proper manner and did what they are more than capable of, we would not be assisting people in combating piracy on their networks,\" they said.\nDespite being outraged with the MPAA and its actions, Descds said that despite being outside of US juristiction he is happy to assist the MPAA in anyway necessary. \"We would like it known for the record that we are actively trying to reach a resolve regards this action by the MPAA. We have contacted them and said openly many times we would welcome their input and act accordingly. Should they feel that NZBS are illegal we will remove those sections immediately and await a legal judgement on their legality. DVDRS is not a pirate network and to call us such has insulted our member base.\"\n\"I would also like it noted that although we host in the US i am actually a UK citizen who currently does not have to adhere to their communications and judgements. However, such is our resolve that I would happily comply should communication between us take place. We can offer little more to help this but hope that the MPAA retract their statement that we are an organised pirate network and restore our good name. Should the MPAA decide to not communicate with us and continue their legal actions we will instruct our attorneys and contact legal bodies like the EFF for help on this matter,\" he added.\nBinnews also had this to say of the MPAA's lawsuit: \"Binnews does not host any files, the claim that we read \"BinNews.com offers files for over 3,000 movies\" is 100% completely false. We do not host any files, never have and never will. We provide a legitimate service to copyright holders. No where on our site does it say, \"join us, we can give you free movies.\" We do not even have pre-made nzb files.\"\nHistory of binnews and dvdrs.net.\nBinnews started \"as a way to monitor what is on usenet,\" according to Joe.\n\"Our intent is not and never has been to facilitate piracy.

Pauline Hanson, Len Harris of the One Nation party, plus the Australian Labor Party's Kim Beazley, Simon Crean and Mark Latham have all been and gone during that time.\nOnly Prime Minister John Howard and Senator Bob Brown are left standing as leaders in the Australian Federal Parliament. Bob Brown was elected to the Senate in 1996, and re-elected in 2001. He has introduced bills for constitutional reform, forest protection, to block radioactive waste dumping, to ban mandatory sentencing, and greenhouse abatement.\nSenator Brown says his party has hardly been in the balance of power at any stage, yet the Australian Greens have risen in popularity. \"We've become the third major political party in the country and we're on our way to becoming a real power broker in this country and ultimately, the aim has to be becoming part of the Government of the country,\" he told ABC Radio. \nWhile there's perpetual media speculation over John Howard's possible retirement, Senator Brown says he's full of beans and ready for the next 10 years. \"And there\u2019s no speculation about me standing at next year\u2019s election.

The raiders, wearing gas masks and driving unmarked vehicles, did not have a warrant and did not identify themselves as police, but a Standard staffer recognized the voice of a police commander among the raiding party. Later at a press conference, Internal Security Minister John Michuki acknowledged the raid occurred as part of a \"state security\" investigation. \nOn Tuesday, February 28, three reporters from \"The Standard\" were arrested for publishing stories Saturday about an alleged secret meeting between Kenyan president Mwai Kibaki, and minister for the environment and deposed former foreign minister Kalonzo Musyoka, who has become an opposition figure to the president's policies, to resolve differences.

Organisers say supporters are converging from across Australia and from overseas. Organisers say up to 20,000 people may take part in talks, rallies, colourful protests and many cultural festivities designed to pressure the Federal Government on Indigeneous rights issues. They want the Government to provide a temporary campsite for the supporters, saying \"organised chaos was better than disorganised chaos.\"\nThe 2006 Stolenwealth Games convergence, described by organisers as the \"cultural festival of the 2006 Commonwealth Games,\" was virtually opened on March 2nd with the launch of the official \"Stolenwealth Games\" website. Scoop Independent News and Perth Indymedia reported that the launch was held at Federation Square in Melbourne. The site contents were projected via wireless laptop by the Stolenwealth Games General Manager, and a tour of the website was given on the big screen. He said \"overwhelming amusement was the response from the audience.\" The group say permanent access points to the website are being set up at public internet facilities across Victoria during the coming weeks. \nSupport.\n\"Interest in the Stolenwealth Games is building all over the world and this fresh, exciting and contemporary site will draw in people from Stolenwealth Nations around the globe to find out about the latest news and events,\" said a Stolenwealth Games spokesperson. \"We have been getting many requests from around the world wanting to know about the Stolenwealth Games. We have provided many ways that individuals and organisations can support the campaign by spreading the word.\"\nThe Victorian Traditional Owner Land Justice Group (VTOLJG) which represents the first nation groups of Victoria, has announced its support to boycott the 2006 Commonwealth Games until the Government \"recognises Traditional Owner rights.\" The group asserts that culture has been misappropriated in preparation for the Games.\nOrganisers of the campaign say they welcome the formal support from the Traditional Owners. \"While some seek to divide and discredit Indigenous Australia, this support is further evidence that the Aboriginal people are united in opposition to the ongoing criminal genocide that is being perpetrated against the Aboriginal people\" said Black GST supporter and Aboriginal Elder, Robbie Thorpe. \n\"We now have endorsement from the VTOLJG and the Aboriginal Tent Embassy for the aims and objectives of the Campaign and we are looking forward to hosting all indigenous and non-indigenous supporters from across Australia in March,\" he said. The Black GST group have said \"the convergence will be held as a peaceful, family-focussed demonstration against genocide, and for the restoration of sovereignty and the negotiations towards a Treaty.\"\nBut the campaign has received flak in mainstream media, such as Melbourne's Herald Sun, who wrote: \"the proposal to allow BlackGST to set up an Aboriginal tent embassy at a site well away from the Commonwealth Games will be interpreted by some as the State Government caving in to a radical protest group. A major concern for the Government... is to protect the event from disruption... no chances should be taken...\"\n\"Games Management Zones\".\nThe Black GST has been planning the convergence for months, calling for Aboriginal people and their supporters to converge on Melbourne. The Melbourne-based Indigenous rights group have called on thousands of people concerned about the plight of indigenous Australians to converge on Melbourne during the Games, which they have dubbed \"the Stolenwealth Games\". But the choice of Kings Domain has made conflict almost inevitable, as the area is one of the areas gazetted by the State Government as a \"Games management zone\".\nUnder the Commonwealth Games Arrangements Act, any area gazetted as a management zone is subject to a range of specific laws - including bans on protesting, creating a disturbance and other activities. The protest bans will be in effect at different times and places, and offenders can be arrested. \nA spokeswoman for the Black GST, which advocates peaceful protest, said the site had been chosen because it was close to where the Queen will stay on March 15. \"We figured that she is only in Melbourne for 27 hours or something like that so we thought we would make it easy for her to come next door and see us,\" she said. \"We are a very open, welcoming group, so she will be welcome to come and join us.\" \nKings Domain is the burial site for 38 indigenous forefathers of Victoria. Black GST elder, Targan, said trade union groups have offered to install infrastructure at the site. The group initially worked with the State Government to find a suitable camp site, but the relationship broke down when the Government failed to meet a deadline imposed by the protesters. \"While we are disappointed the ministers were not able to meet deadline on our request, we thank them for their constructive approach towards negotiations and the open-door policy exercised,\" said Targan. \nA spokesman for Games Minister Justin Madden said the Government was still investigating other sites. Victoria Police Games security commander Brendan Bannan said he was not convinced the Black GST represented the views of most indigenous people. \"We are dealing with the Aboriginal community and they don't seem to support it at all \u2026 the wider Aboriginal community don't support disruption to the Games at all,\" he said. \nThe Government was told that Black GST supporters would camp in Fitzroy Gardens and other city parks should it fail to nominate a site. A spokesman for Aboriginal Affairs Minister Gavan Jennings said the Government was taking the issue seriously, but had not been able to finalise a campsite before the deadline. \nUnder special Games laws, people protesting or causing a disturbance in \"Games management zones\" can be arrested and fined. While prominent public spaces such as Federation Square, Birrarung Marr, Albert Park and the Alexandra Gardens fall under the legislation, such tough anti-protest laws cannot be enforced in the nearby Fitzroy Gardens.\nGames chairman Ron Walker has urged the group to choose another date for its protest march through the city, which is currently planned to coincide with the opening ceremony on March 15. The group believes that an opportunity to gain attention for indigenous issues was lost at the Sydney Olympics and has vowed to make a highly visible presence at the Games.\nSacred Flames.\nThe Black GST said the Australian Aboriginal Tent Embassy's sacred flame, burning over many years at the Canberra site will be carried to Melbourne before the Games, and its arrival would mark the opening of the protest camp from where a march will proceed to the MCG before the Opening Ceremony. \nBlack GST claims supporters from all over Australia, including three busloads from the West Australian Land Council, will gather in Melbourne during the Games for peaceful protests.\nAboriginal Affairs Minister Gavin Jennings had offered Victoria Park to the protesters. Victoria Park, former home of Collingwood Football Club, where one of the strongest statements of Aboriginal pride, when St Kilda star Nicky Winmar in 1993 raised his jumper and pointed to his bare chest after racial taunts from the Collingwood crowd.\nBlack GST, which has labelled the Games the Stolenwealth Games, said the State Government had failed to find a suitable venue. Black GST may encourage protesters to camp in prominent parks such as Fitzroy Gardens and Treasury Gardens. Graffiti supporting the action has also appeared in central Melbourne.\nMelbourne City councillor Fraser Brindley has offered his home to the Black GST organisers. \"I offered my home up to people who are organising visitors to come to the Games,\" he said. Cr Brindley will be overseas when the Commonwealth Games are held and has offered the free accommodation at his flat at Parkville. He said he agreed with the protesters' view that treaties needed to be signed with indigenous Australians. \"I'm offering it up to the indigenous people who are coming to remind Her Majesty that her Empire took this land from them,\" said Cr Brindlley. Nationals leader Peter Ryan said: \"This extremist group has no part in the Australian community.\" Melbourne councillor Peter Clarke said the actions were embarrassing and that he would try to discourage him. \"It's not in the spirit of the Games,\" he said.\nAboriginal elder, Targan, said the possibility of securing Victoria Park was delightfully ironic. \"There's a lot of irony going on,\" Targan, 53, a PhD student at Melbourne University, said. \"GST stands for Genocide, Sovereignty and Treaty. We want the genocide of our people to stop; we want some sovereignty over traditional land, certainly how it is used, and we want a treaty with the government,\" Targan said."}

All other signatories have agreed that they will not seek nuclear weapons technology. 187 sovereign nations are currently signed on to the NPT; however India, Pakistan, and Israel have not.

According to the , from 2000 to 2005 Australia exported 46,600 tonnes of uranium, to the value of over 2.1 billion. Australia currently exports to the USA, Japan, South Korea, Spain, France, the United Kingdom, Sweden, Germany, Belgium and Finland.

Because of the government's decision to block the site, many Pakistani bloggers are now unable to update their blogs.\nBloggers are debating whether the move by the Pakistani government is a sign of a long-term online censorship campaign, or a temporary move to prevent potentially embarrassing blog coverage of U.S. President George W.

It was suspected by residents and business owners in the area that hotel once stood in the same spot.\nThe Elmwood Village hotel is a proposed development by Savarino Construction Services Corp. In order for the project to proceed, at least five buildings (1119-1121 Elmwood) would need to be demolished. All five houses are currently occupied by businesses and residents.\nAfter some research, a freelance journalist writing for \"Wikinews\" was able to determine that there was never a hotel on the proposed Elmwood Village Hotel site. However; there was a temporary hotel located on the northeast corner of Elmwood and Forest.\nBuffalo was the host of the Pan-American Exposition from May 1 until November 2, 1901. It was a fair designed to feature the latest in technology, including electricity. There was a midway, athletic events, and had African, Eskimo, and Mexican villages. However; what is likely the most famous event that took place at the exposition was the assassination of then President William McKinley on September 6, 1901. He was shot by Leon Czolgosz just outside the Temple of Music and died eight days later while in the home of John Milburn on Delaware Avenue in Buffalo. Just a short time later, Theodore Roosevelt was inaugurated on September 14, 1901 at the Wilcox House on Delaware Avenue in Buffalo. Nearly eight million people attended the exposition.\nDuring that time several hotels and rooming houses were built around the exposition including The Elmwood at 717 Elmwood, the Hotel Elmhurst at Forest and Lincoln Parkway, Hotel Gibbs 1005-1021 Elmwood, the R. Palmerton Merritt at 441 Forest and The Norman at 422 Forest. None of these hotels or rooming houses exist today.\nProbably the most famous hotel that was built during the exposition was the Statler's Pan-American Hotel built by Ellsworth Milton Statler A freelance journalist writing for \"Wikinews\" has obtained the only known reproduction photo of the hotel [pictured at the top]. The hotel stood on the northeast corner of Elmwood and Forest Avenues in Buffalo, had 2,100 sleeping rooms and accommodations for 5,000. At the time, the Statler was the largest hotel [based on the number of rooms] ever constructed. It was also the largest temporary hotel. It was three stories high, plastered on the inside, made mostly of wood and was covered with ornamental staff on the outside, which made it semi-fireproof. Every room was an outside room and was well lighted and ventilated. It was located within one block of the exposition's main entrance.\nThe Statler was built for only one thing, the exposition. Work began in 1900 and finished just before the beginning of the exposition. When the exposition ended in November, the hotel was taken down.\nMaps from 1894 show that there was no hotel, let alone any buildings or houses on the intersection. However; research did show that the homes 1119-1121 Elmwood, the buildings that would be demolished to build the Elmwood Village Hotel, were built sometime before 1915 but were not on the intersection prior to 1902.\nBased on research conducted at the Buffalo Historical Society, it was concluded that between the years of 1890 and 1902, no other major hotel existed in the area. In fact, research had shown that almost every hotel built in the area, existed only during the time of the exposition. \nResearch also indicated a hotel or a rooming house at 1089 Elmwood around 1901-1903. The only known name of the hotel was the John C. Hill Hotel. The hotel was in the house now called the Atwater House. The house was the first house to be built on the east side of the block.\nThe Atwater House is currently vacant and owner Pano Georgiadis wants to demolish it to expand his restaurant. The house was built by 1894 and the original owner and builder of the house is currently unknown. Its earliest known occupant was Edward Atwater who in 1862 founded the oil refinery company of Atwater &amp; Hawes in Buffalo. The site of this company was recently uncovered in the Canal District during an archeological dig. \nAt the moment, current research does not show any connection between the two men.\nStatler's Pan-American Hotel was financially unsuccessful.\nThe exposition was a commercial failure and what profit Statler did make on the hotel, went to build another temporary hotel for the 1904 St. Louis Exhibition. That hotel was successful and the profit made from it was used to build the first permanent Statler Hotel at 107 Delaware Avenue in Buffalo. The hotel is no longer in operation, but small offices are currently operating in parts of the building."}

Parade organisers estimated the crowd at over 450,000. They lined Oxford St - along the parade's route - in Sydney's unofficial gay district, cheering the 6,000 participants and 120 floats. \nThe Mardi Gras event was the culmination of a month of gay-pride festivities. Many parade participants adopted the theme of the film \"Brokeback Mountain\". The parade was led as usual by the motorcycle group, Dykes on Bikes. Amongst the frivolity and colour, onlookers saw \"Kate Moss dancers\" snorting 'cocaine', and the gun-wielding - apparently gay-friendly - Dick Cheney. A lampoon of Prime Minister John Howard - a pirate ship carrying \"Captain Crook\" was also featured. \nA Mardi Gras participant, Filipino Fyljoy Volefdico, 25, said: \"I think within Australia there is really a lot of culture and it's great when the whole community comes together and celebrates it.\" \nJay Lynch, who met his partner at the event two years ago, said: \"It has become a meeting ground for gays from around the world and as discrimination continues it's important we can connect on this level, and continually redefine what it means to the community.\" \nChair of the New Mardi Gras board, Marcus Bourget, said the event is about providing a powerful voice for the lesbian and gay community. Describing the parade as \"a great Aussie tradition\", Bourget said he was proud of the event. \"We've run a fairly sophisticated marketing campaign this year, which has led to gradual growth internationally,\" he said. \nNewcastle woman Donna Newella said Mardi Gras had become many things to many people, \"It is not just about gays and lesbians,\" she said. \"It's about all different issues that have arisen,\" she said \"freedom of speech, being able to represent one's identity and being able to put a political point across.\"\nThe first Mardi Gras took place on June 24, 1978 as a protest against a ban on homosexuality in Australia. It began as an improvised street party following a gay-rights rally. However when a city official interrupted the festivities, things turned ugly. On that night there were 53 arrests and many allegations of police brutality. Homosexuality was later decriminalised in Australia in 1984. \nLocal businesses realise the economic importance of the event, which is a huge money-spinner, they say. Visitors to Sydney for last year's Mardi Gras contributed an estimated $46 million to the State's economy. Organisers say about 6000 international visitors, the majority from Britain and the USA, attended this year's event. \n\"We came all the way from America to see this,\" Mrs Phyllis Drucker 67, from Los Angeles, said. \"We were told it's the best in the world, and we're going to have a ball.\"\nA float entitled \"Love Between the Flags\" highlighted the need for racial harmony and cultural acceptance following last year's Cronulla riots. Creative director Graham Browning said the theme of the parade, \"I believe\", aimed to reflect political and social issues.

The government will also pay his family's legal bill of more than $1 million.\nBetween 2000 and 2002 the Badraie family were incarcerated behind the razorwire of the (now mothballed) Woomera Detention Facility, a remote desert camp in outback South Australia - and later sent to the Villawood Detention Centre in Sydney. In 2001, video footage of his condition was smuggled out of Villawood, inciting national debate over Prime Minister John Howard's controversial policy of detaining children. \nBadraie's family lawyer, Rebecca Gilsenan, said the family are \"looking forward to living a normal life in the community. The settlement will enable the treatment he needs to somehow rectify the damage done in the detention centres. The fact the Government has settled the case indicates a serious concern on their part they were going to be found guilty of negligence,\" Gilsenan told reporters. \nShayan, his father and stepmother arrived in Australia in 2000, and were sent immediately to the notorious Woomera desert camp. During his 17 months incarceration, Shayan stopped drinking, eating and speaking. \n\"He witnessed a series of incredibly traumatic and violent events, the sort of events no adult or no child should be exposed to,\" Gilsenan said. \"Within a year of being detained at the detention centre... he had developed psychiatric illness to the point of diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder and later depression,\" she said.\nThe court heard evidence from former senior immigration official Philippa Godwin that detention could damage the mental health of refugees - directly contradicting the Government's claims the centres were safe. Opposition immigration spokesman Tony Burke said: \"Children should never have been put in detention and money will never undo the damage and pain.\"\nThe Department of Immigration said the agreement was \"no admission of guilt\". Immigration Minister Amanda Vanstone says she does not believe a $400,000 is a backdown. Vanstone said an offer was made to the Badraie family's lawyer some time ago but they turned it down. \nCompared with similar countries, Australia has some of the toughest policies in the world against refugee arrivals. Policies include immediate mandatory detention of boat arrivals, the detention of workers and students who overstay their visas are sent to detention camps under harsh conditions. Immigration detainees often languish in limbo with some up to six years while their cases are being heard. These camps have been condemned by many international human rights groups. \nGreens senator Kerry Nettle says \"hundreds of children have been mentally scarred by their time in immigration detention and further claims are planned.\" She blames the Federal Government's policy of mandatory detention. \n\"The Government has accepted the responsibility for the health consequences of their policy of mandatory detention,\" Senator Nettle said. \"There is a raft of children, we are talking hundreds of children, and adults, who have had their mental health significantly impacted by the policy of mandatory detention.\"\nShe rejected that the Federal Government deserve congratulations over settlement: \"To have gone through these proceedings, and spent the amount of money they have spent, to put Shayan's mother in the witness box for two weeks, is not an indication of a willingness and public accountability by the Government to accept responsibility for their actions,\" Senator Nettle said.\nLawyer Rebecca Gilsenan says the landmark case may pave the way for more litigation by other refugee families. It is the first time the Department has conceded that a child has been psychologically harmed in its detention. \nGilsenan says the outcome sets a precedent for other detainees. \"The problems that Shayan experienced were systemic problems rather than ones that were just specific to him, although the particular treatment that he received was disgraceful,\" she said. \"So it's quite possible that there are other children or even adults out there who lived in a similar environment during that time in immigration detention and possibly have similar problems.\"\nShe says she hopes the systemic problems highlighted in the case will now be addressed. \"I can only hope that the Government takes notice of this and doesn't continue to spend taxpayer money on having to compensate people for treating them in a disgraceful way in immigration detention.\""}

The Immigration Department says Robert Jovicic will be given a special purpose visa and his status as a permanent resident will be reinstated.\nHe became a nationless man, impoverished, battling mental health problems and sleeping on the streets of Belgrade. Mr Jovicic, 39, was born in France and arrived in Australia as a two-year-old with his Serbian-born parents. Like nearly one million Australian residents eligible for Australian citizenship, Jovicic never officially became an Australian citizen. \nEx-Federal Immigration Minister, and now Attorney General, Philip Ruddock ordered Jovicic's deportation on character grounds in June 2004 - after he was jailed for committing crimes in support of a heroin addiction. Mr Jovicic says he had since kicked his drug habit.\nThe current Immigration Minister Amanda Vanstone said it was a \"very hard decision\" to allow Mr. Jovicic to return to Australia. \"[the community] expected to be protected from non-citizens who break the law. On balance, after some anguished consideration, I decided to allow him to return,\" the Minister said. She said Mr Jovicic was not stateless, he had just refused to apply for Serbian citizenship.\nHis family say Serbia revoked his citizenship after discovering \"the paperwork used by Australian authorities to deport him was invalid\". They claim he has since been unable to work, access doctors, welfare or even book a hotel. His family also claims that he does not speak Serbian, and has not been permitted to work because of this. He says he is grateful his ordeal is nearing an end. \nRobert Jovicic's sister says people have no reason to fear her brother's return to Australia. \"People need to be reminded that he's not a drug addict any more. He stopped using a long time ago,\" Susanna Jovicic said. \"If people fear that he's going to re-offend, I think that he's more chance of winning lotto,\" she said. \"All he wants is his life back. I think that's the most paramount thing that people need to understand. Once he'd done his time, I know that in jail he stopped (using heroin). He came out, he started a new life.\" \nMs Jovicic said the family is yet to pursue compensation. \"I can tell you right now, we have not had a conversation about compensation...\" she said. \"We just want him home.\" She says the first priority will be to seek medical treatment. Her brother's health problems include scoliosis, an enlarged prostate, mental illness, sand in his kidneys and the need of a catheter to urinate. \nShe said Immigration Minister Amanda Vanstone's decision to allow his return \"validates our belief that Robert was wrongly deported,\" she said. \"I think anybody who has been deported has the legal right to return. The family will be there at the airport waiting for him and it will be quite emotional.\"\nMinister Vanstone said in a November 2005 media release: \"Mr Jovicic is not an Australian citizen:\nMr Jovicic, a convicted criminal, had his Permanent Visa cancelled in October 2002 under Section 501 of the Migration Act by the former Minister for Immigration, Philip Ruddock... As an adult between 1984 and 2002, Mr Jovicic was convicted on charges of burglary, theft, possessing stolen property and possessing prohibited substances. In 1998 Mr Jovicic applied for Australian citizenship but was refused on the grounds that he was not of good character.\"\nCommonwealth Ombudsman John McMillan found Senator Vanstone's department had unfairly deported people with criminal records who had lived in Australia since they were children. However, Vanstone said she supports the changes to the Migration Act which allow the Immigration Minister to \"deport non citizens who break the law on character grounds and make the decision unappealable.\""}

The economic growth has been enormous. It's important that we do what we can to strengthen the economic relationship with India,\" he said.\nThis is Mr Howards second visit to India as Prime Minister.

The H5N1 strain of bird flu has already been found responsible for the deaths of over 93 humans in the entire world. Some scientists fear it may be starting to establish a foothold in Eastern and Central Europe.\nThere have been isolated cases of H5N1 transmission from birds to humans, raising fears among the international scientific community that the virus will combine with a human influenza virus, mutating in such a way that it could transfer readily from human to human. A global pandemic, similar to the Spanish influenza outbreak of 1918, could result.\nThe two cases in Poland were discovered in the northern town of Toru\u0144, famous as the birthplace of Nicolaus Copernicus. Two swans have been confirmed to have been carriers of the virus. Samples from the subjects have been sent to the European Union (EU) laboratories in Weybridge, England, but initial assessments have been seen as highly reliable. \"Yes, we have confirmed that it is definitely H5N1,\" said Jan Zmudzinski, director of Poland's national laboratory, in the town of Pulawy. A hygiene-security zone protected by police has been established, extending up to several hundred metres from the spot on the river bank of the Vistula river where the swans were found.\n, a resident of Toru\u0144, told Wikinews that he has observed authorities putting precautionary measures in place to attempt to slow the spread of bird flu. He said that during March 6 and 7 he observed:\nThe World Health Organisation held a three-day emergency meeting in Geneva, Switzerland, to discuss plans to deal with the virus, and also to revisit contingency plans for the possibility of a future pandemic. With the discovery of H5N1 in Poland, fears of a pandemic have increased in the scientific community. \"Events in recent weeks justify that concern,\" said Margaret Chan, special advisor to the WHO on avian influenza.\nWhile bird flu has not affected Europe's agricultural output as much as it has that of Southeast Asia, there have been some serious economic consequences of the recent bird flu outbreaks on the continent. France has been forced to increase its subsidies to poultry farmers, spending over 52 million euros ($63 million USD) in aid. Over thirty bird cases have been confirmed in France, while Germany is currently investigating a possible case in a cat. "}

Dennett's book presents the point of view of an individual religious meme, in competition with other memes, trying to maximize its own successful spread.\nWieseltier objects to Dennett's \"meme's eye view\" analysis as \"scientism\", claiming that \"Dennett lives in a world in which you must believe in the grossest biologism or in the grossest theism, in a purely naturalistic understanding of religion or in intelligent design, in the omniscience of a white man with a long beard in 19th-century England or in the omniscience of a white man with a long beard in the sky.\" Not all aspects of human life can or should be illuminated by scientific methods, claims Wieseltier.\nDennett responded that this criticism followed a pattern of recent \"stunts\" by the \"New York Times\" book review: \"When you can't stand the implications of some scientific discipline X, but can't think of any solid objections, you brand them instances of the sin of Xism and then you don't have to take them seriously!\" He continues to state that \"the very idea of an intensive scientific exploration of religion so upsets Wieseltier that he resorts to flagrant falsehoods \u2014 and doesn't even bother supporting his claims with citations.\"\nWieseltier also criticizes several of Dennett's quotations of fellow philosophers, including David Hume, William James, and personal friend of Dennett's Thomas Nagel. \nBrian Leiter, a professor of philosophy at the University of Texas, also objects to Wieseltier's claim that some aspects of human life can not be illuminated by a scientific approach. \"'The view that science can explain all human conditions and expressions, mental as well as physical' is not a 'superstition' but a reasonable methodological posture to adopt based on the actual evidence, that is, based on the actual expanding success of the sciences... during the last hundred years,\" writes Leiter. \nDennett is eager for the religious to read \"Breaking the Spell\", and spends the first third of the book motivating and justifying his project; this may have had bearing on the \"Times\"' selection of reviewers.\nBoth the selfish gene theory and the idea of memes were originally popularized by Professor Richard Dawkins (University of Oxford, Biologist), in his book \"The Selfish Gene\". The selfish gene theory is the most widely accepted basis for mathematical models in evolutionary biology, as it has repeatedly correctly modeled various problematic situations, such as gender ratios in insect species with haploid males.\nDaniel Dennett is among the most widely read living philosophers, highly regarded for the diversity of his academic contributions. Many of his popular works concern evolution, memetics, and human thought."}

If approved by shareholders and regulators, the merger would create the largest telecommunications company in the United States, with control of over half of the telephone lines in the country and the largest cellular service provider, Cingular Wireless.\n\"This transaction combines two solid, very well-run companies,\" AT&amp;T Chairman and CEO Edward E. Whitacre said in a press statement. \"BellSouth operates in an attractive region with a growing economy. It has great employees and an outstanding network, with fiber optics deeply deployed in its service area. It has a strong record in terms of customer service and a sound, conservative balance sheet. These strengths, added to those of AT&amp;T, will improve our ability to provide innovative services to more customers while returning substantial value to our owners and improving our growth profile.\"\nAT&amp;T and BellSouth had shared ownership and operations of Cingular Wireless, which will be absorbed by AT&amp;T as part of the merger. If the deal passes shareholders, BellSouth stock holders will receive 1.325 shares of AT&amp;T common stock for each single share held of BellSouth stock. at a rate of 1.325 shares of AT&amp;T stock per BellSouth share. Though subject to approval by government regulators and shareholders of both companies, the merger is expected to be completed within the next year.\nBellSouth and AT&amp;T employ nearly 316,000 people in the United States. The merger, if approved, would give AT&amp;T 70 million telephone users, almost 10 million broadband subscribers, and AT&amp;T will provide services to more than half the companies on the \"Fortune 100\" in 22 states.\nWhitacre will remain as chairman, CEO and a member of the board of directors of the combined company. Duane Ackerman, currently chairman and CEO of BellSouth, will remain in his position for a transition period following the merger. Additionally, three members of BellSouth's board of directors will join the AT&amp;T board.\nThe announced purchase recalls the planned US$115 billion dollar merger of MCI WorldCom and Sprint in 1999 that was prohibited by the federal government. Despite this, analysts think the federal actions will be smaller, since these actions came under protest three months ago due to the actions of their European rivals.\nWith the price of AT&amp;T closing at US$27.99 per share, and the price of BellSouth closing at US$37.09 per share, AT&amp;T will pay an additional 17.9% for each stock of BellSouth. This operation ultimately leads to a capitalization of US$165 billion, and officials with the companies predict a force reduction of at least 10,000 employees, lower costs of operation in networks, and an overall savings of $2 billion after the second year, with altogether savings reaching US$18 billion. \nAT&amp;T also announced that it will try to acquire the US$10 billion worth of stocks that were yielded during the company's bankruptcy in 1984.\nThe corporate headquarters for the combined company are expected to remain in San Antonio, Texas, though Georgia Governor Sonny Perdue and Atlanta Mayor Shirley Franklin said Monday that they will work to persuade AT&amp;T executives to move their headquarters to the BellSouth HQ in Atlanta. Cingular's headquarters will remain in Atlanta, as will the combined company's Southeast regional telephone company headquarters."}

He was 45 years old.\nThe Hall of Fame center fielder, whose .318 career batting average is surpassed only by Joe DiMaggio among right-handed hitters, was a ten-time All-Star in twelve seasons with the Minnesota Twins. \"Puck\" won six Gold Glove awards and five Silver Slugger awards for defensive and offensive excellence at his position, and led the Twins to World Series Championships in 1987 and 1991. He retired as the Twins' all-time leader in hits, doubles, total bases, at-bats and runs, records that he still holds to this day. Unfortunately, his playing career was cut short in 1996, when he was diagnosed with glaucoma, which has left him blind in one eye. Even though his career was considerably shorter than those of most inductees, it was long enough for Baseball Hall of Fame eligibility. He was inducted in 2001, his first year of eligibility.\nPuckett had gained weight in recent years, and was reportedly still suffering from a bitter divorce in 2002, and was still depressed about his career being cut short. His professional relationship with the Twins ended in 2002, and he went into seclusion thereafter. However, the Twins have constantly attempted to contact Puckett in hopes that he would return to help the team in some form. He also had his personal reputation sullied by an incident in 2003 where he was accused of groping a woman in a bathroom in a Minneapolis-area restaurant. He was cleared of all charges, but the emotional damage he incurred from the incident had increased his self-imposed seclusion from the baseball community.\nPuckett suffered the stroke early Sunday morning at his home in Scottsdale, Arizona. He was initially transported by ambulance to Scottsdale Memorial Hospital, then was airlifted to Scottsdale Osborne Hospital for emergency surgery in an attempt to stop a cerebral hemorrhage. After that, he was transferred St. Joseph's Hospital and Medical Center's Barrow Neurological Institute in Phoenix in hopes of further treatment. His condition declined, however. He received the last rites and passed away Monday afternoon.\nPuckett is survived by his ex-wife Tonya, his children Catherine and Kirby Jr., and his fiancee, Jodi Olson. Funeral arrangements are pending."}

Leading environmental scientist Professor Norman Myers says the Earth is experiencing its \"Sixth Extinction.\" \nScientists forecast that up to five million species will be lost this century. \"We are well into the opening phase of a mass extinction of species. There are about 10 million species on earth. If we carry on as we are, we could lose half of all those 10 million species,\" Myers said. \nIf we do not do more, Myers says, the planet will continue to lose around 50 species per day compared to the natural extinction rate of one species every five years. He projected this rate in the late 1980s to much criticism, but the figure is now widely accepted by scientists. \"The whole thing is taking place in what you might call a flickering of an evolutionary eye,\" said Myers. \"It's hard to keep up with unless we damp down on some of the causes of the evolution.\"\nHotspots.\n The Australia Museum's Frank Howarth says \"There are over 30 extinction 'hotspots' across the globe. He says up to 80 per cent of crucial habitat has been wiped out. Biodiversity hotspots are areas that have more than 1500 endemic plant species and which have lost more than 70per cent of original habitat.\" Hotspots feature, according to Myers, \"exceptional concentrations of species that are found nowhere else in the world.\"\nEvidence shows that insects, which account for more than half the described species on earth, are disappearing faster than birds. \"Many areas of Australia's ecosystems depend on the work of insects... we put a lot of effort into looking at these hotspots, about what insects actually occur there, whether their numbers are increasing or decreasing, because they tell us a lot more about some of the high level effects,\" Howarth said.\nMyers argues that we are destroying the Earth\u2019s biodiversity quickly enough to witness the beginning of a mass extinction of species\u2014one of only six such events in the Earth\u2019s history. He says around 30 hotspots contain the last remaining habitats of at least half of Earth\u2019s land surface. \nHe says more parks and reserves are needed, and while warnings are desperate, he believes the situation can be turned around. \"We would be the first generation in the whole of human history since we came out of our caves to tackle a mass extinction head on and cancel it... and if we do, I think people will cheer for us from thousands of years ahead.\" Myers projects that safeguarding the hotspots would cost one billion dollars per year.\nWhere are the frogs?\nThe Global Amphibian Assessment, an international convention of amphibian biologists, indicated in 2004 that over a third of the world's amphibian species are threatened, making them the most threatened group of animals on the planet. More than 120 species have likely become extinct since the 1980s, and around two-thirds of the South American harlequin frog species vanished in the 1980s and 1990s. The decline of amphibians in protected habitats has puzzled conservation biologists for nearly 20 years. \nRecent research suggests that climate change may be driving widespread frog extinctions. Results of a study published in the January 2006 \"Nature\" journal reveal how warming alters a fatal skin fungus affecting frogs. The article says hundreds of species around the world are teetering on the brink of extinction or have already become extinct. \n\"Disease is the bullet that's killing the frogs,\" said J. Alan Pounds, the study's lead scientist from the Tropical Science Center in Costa Rica. \"But climate change is pulling the trigger. Global warming is wreaking havoc on amphibians, and soon will cause staggering losses of biodiversity,\" he said.\nAccording to the study, rising temperatures favor the chytrid fungus, which seems to kill frogs mostly in cool highlands or during winter\u2014implying that low temperatures make it more deadly. National Science Foundation program director Sam Scheiner said their study \"demonstrates the complex nature of global climate change, including how climate affects the spread of disease, and why these must be integrated if we are to understand and reduce threats to species extinctions.\"\nScheiner says the message goes beyond amphibians: \"global warming and the accompanying emergence of infectious diseases are a real and immediate threat to biodiversity and a growing challenge for humankind.\"\n\"The Sixth Extinction\".\nScientists are warning that by the end of this century, the planet could lose up to half its species, and that these extinctions will alter not only biological diversity but also the evolutionary processes itself. They state that human activities have brought our planet to the point of biotic crisis. \nIn 1993, Harvard biologist E.O. Wilson estimated that the planet is losing 30,000 species per year - around three species per hour. Some biologists have begun to feel that the biodiversity crisis dubbed the \"Sixth Extinction\" is even more severe, and more imminent, than Wilson had expected.\nProfessor Myers and colleague Andrew H. Knoll say that what we do now will define a course for evolution. In their 2001 American Institute of Biological Sciences report, Myers and Knoll forecast that the effects of a Sixth Extinction will leave gene pools so depleted that species may not bounce back. Species such as rodents and cockroaches that have adapted to human environments will dominate. \nNiles Eldredge in his paper \"The Sixth Extinction\" says that with the high rate of extinction, there is little doubt left in the minds of professional biologists that the biosphere is currently facing a mounting, unprecedented loss of species. \nWhilst previous mass extinctions were due to natural environmental causes, research shows that wherever on Earth humans have migrated other species have become extinct. Human overpopulation especially in the past two centuries is said to be the underlying cause of the Sixth Extinction."}

She was recently suspended with pay by the TSA and retained Roscoe Howard to act as legal council in the face of legal actions that might arise against her. \nJudge initially ruled to prevent testimony from any aviation employees, but reversed her decision after the prosecution argued they would have little case left if their testimony remained inadmissible. FAA employee testimony is expected to take the form of what measures would have been taken by the agency to prevent against the September 11, 2001 airliner attacks in New York City and Washington D.C. if Moussaoui had warned officials of the plan prior to the strikes. \nThe connection to the Carla Martin involvement in the case was discovered in a separate trial involving liability law suits against two U.S. airline companies for losses as a result of the attacks. Family member lawyers of flight attendants drew attention to contacts by Martin to persons involved in the case. \nThe jury will return Monday for the trial's resumption.\nA U.S. federal public defender appointed to Moussaoui argued for the jury to spare his life during opening statements on Monday, March 6, in the trial that will determine his fate \u2014 either life in prison or death by lethal injection.\nDefense attorney Edward B. MacMahon said that Moussaoui \"aspires to martyrdom,\" and called on jurors to deny the Al-Qaeda operative his wish to die. A wish that would result in him becoming \"a smiling face on a recruiting poster for Osama bin Laden,\" MacMahon said.\nMoussaoui is believed by some to be the missing member in the team of 19 other attackers that carried out the suicide airliner strikes in New York City and Washington D.C. Arrested in Minnesota on immigration charges three weeks prior to the attacks, Moussaoui could have warned officials of the pending attacks, but failed to do so, argued Assistant U.S. Attorney Rob Spencer for the prosecution in opening statements.\nThe second day of the trial both Moussaoui and juror's attention was riveted as a federal prosecutor read a radio transmission account of the exchange between a flight attendant on Flight 11 and ground controllers.\n\"We are flying low. We are flying very very low. We are flying way too low,\" Amy Sweeney told controllers, according to an Associated Press report. The plane crashed into the north tower of the World Trade Center at 8:44 a.m. after she said, \"Oh my God, we are way too low!\"\nMoussaoui has claimed that he had no involvement with the 9/11 attacks when he pleaded guilty to:\nHe said that he was to play a role in another future attack on the White House using an aircraft. Four of the conspiracy charges each carry a maximum penalty of death.\nFamily members of the nearly 3,000 killed in the attacks were able to watch the Alexandria, Virginia courtroom proceedings by closed-circuit television in six U.S. cities: New York, Boston, Central Islip, N.Y., , N.J., and Philadelphia.\nMoussaoui has a history of disrupting previous trial proceedings with outbursts. He has disavowed his lawyers, and mostly ignored his mother who was present during the opening days of the trial because she had spoken to his defense lawyers.\nUpon leaving the Tuesday, March 7 court session for a recess, Moussaoui pumped his right fist in the air and shouted, \"Allah Akbar! God curse America! Bless Osama bin Laden!\"\nThe outbursts have been timed to occur outside the earshot of Judge Brinkema and the jury as those persons filed out of the courtroom for recesses.\nMoussaoui pleaded guilty in April last year to the conspiracy charges. Evidence linking him to the plot was discovered when his duffel bags were searched after the attacks."}

He was 93.\nParks was a pioneering black artist with an impressive list of honors and accomplishments, including at least 40 honorary doctorate degrees. He was the first African American staff photographer for \"Life\" magazine, where he worked from 1948 to 1972. President Reagan presented him with the National Medal of Arts in 1988. He published at least five semi or wholly autobiographical books.\nGordon Roger Alexander Buchannan Parks was born November 30, 1912, in Fort Scott, Kansas, the youngest of 15 children. After his mother's death when he was 16, he moved to St. Paul, Minnesota, where he attended high school. He dropped out in order to find work during increasingly hard times, traveling extensively in the North and Northwest looking for jobs. \nIn 1938, he bought his first camera and experimented with both documentary and fashion photography. At age 30, he won a fellowship and traveled to Washington, D.C., where he worked as a photographer for the Farm Security Administration and later for the Office of War Information.\nDuring his time at the FSA, Parks composed photo-essays critical of the racial and social prejudices many faced. His work drew attention both to himself and to the poverty and social injustices of the time.\nAfter the beginning of the war, Parks moved to Harlem, where he found a job as a fashion photographer for \"Vogue\" and continued to take socially provocative photos of slum life in the city. It was these photos that convinced \"Life\"'s photography editor to hire him.\nIn 1962, Parks wrote \"The Learning Tree\", based on his Kansas childhood. The book was a success, and Parks later directed the film version, for which he also wrote the screenplay and the music. \"The Learning Tree\" was one of the first 25 films placed on the National Film Registry. Parks next directed \"Shaft\" and its successful sequel, \"Shaft's Big Score\", as well as a blaxploitation comedy called \"Supercops\".\nParks' other artistic achievements include a ballet, written about Martin Luther King, Jr., four other memoirs, a collection of poetry, several original musical compositions and at least one other fictional, non-autobiographical novel. Collections and exhibits of his photography have traveled extensively within and beyond the United States.\nHe is survived by his three ex-wives, Sally Alvis, Elizabeth Campbell, and Ms. Young; his daughter, Toni Parks Parson, and his son, David, from his first marriage; and a daughter, Leslie Parks Harding, from his second marriage; five grandchildren; and five great grandchildren. A son, Gordon Parks Jr., died in 1979."}

By December, isoHunt had 16,248 torrents available.

How did you react?\"&lt;BR&gt;\nI found out first from Mike at Slyck.com, who have received letters of the press release, along with other news outlets like CNET. Within a few hours, all the news sites posted about it.\n\"Do you feel it is appropriate for the MPAA to publicly announce that they have commenced action against your sites and others before you even receive notification?\"&lt;BR&gt;\nYes, although not surprising.
